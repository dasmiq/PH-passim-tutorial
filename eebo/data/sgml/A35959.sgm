<P>MY first Application is for Pardon, that I should adventure to prefix your names to the Frontispice of this small <HI>Fabrick,</HI> between which and your singular <HI>Merits,</HI> there is no Proportion, save what flows from the Uniformity and Deli|cacy of the Contrivance, and sincerity of his Respects who presents it. I have sometimes appeared in publick, though not with the <HI>Gold of Ophir,</HI> and <HI>Tyrian Purpure,</HI> wherewith the <HI>Persians</HI> were accustomed to present their Princes, and Benefactors, in testimony of their Obeysance and Gratitude; yet with Oblations sutable to my Ability as now,
<PB REF="3">
though unsutable to your Honour and Dig|nity.</P>
<P>Your unstained Reputation, Candour, and Ingenuity, by which you are guided in the Management of the weighty Affairs of the City. Your encouraging by your Au|thority and good example the holy Mini|stry, Vertue and Learning in Schooles and Universities, within the <HI>Verge</HI> of your <HI>Iuris|diction.</HI> The commemoration of Favours, which I have received from the <HI>Council,</HI> these many years bygone, have had no small In|fluence upon me, to make this publick, yet humble Address. And though I have done but little by way of Remuneration, yet <HI>Somewhat,</HI> to be a Remembrance of my hearty affection to the <HI>Good Town.</HI></P>
<P>I have made some small attempts, during the twelve years I taught <HI>Peripatetick,</HI> and <HI>Experimental Philosophy,</HI> and since, for the Ad|vancement of Learning among others, which have not wanted success, whereby the Au|thor hath been encouraged; especially by the kind acceptance, his <HI>Writings</HI> have met with from the greatest <HI>Philosophers</HI> and <HI>Ma|thematicians</HI> in this Age, in <HI>England, Holland, Germany</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> It is yet recent in the minds of many Noble and worthy Persons,
<PB REF="3">
what esteem His <HI>Royal Highness</HI> had of my Observations, of the great <HI>Blazing Star,</HI> which appeared in <HI>December</HI> 1680, which since have been published. I do not mention this for applause, or out of vanity, but for some peculiar reasons hinted at below. But these studies being only <HI>Hand-maids,</HI> and <HI>Subser|vient</HI> to <HI>Divine Knowledge,</HI> and not so gene|rally useful, I have now given them a Ma|numission, unless I be animated by the be|nign, and favourable aspect of those, who may and can. I move in a distinct Sphere from Masters of Universities. They teach in <HI>Philosophy, the Causes and Reasons of Things.</HI> What I write is but <HI>Practical</HI> and <HI>Mechanical,</HI> for the promoting of natural Knowledge and Learn|ing, as do the <HI>Virtuosi.</HI> But in stead of such I present your <HI>Honours</HI> with a small bundle of <HI>Orthodox Truths</HI> confirmed by plain Scrip|ture Testimonies, wherewith the true Chri|stian Church hath in all Ages scattered the swarms of dark Errors, and damnable He|resies, Locusts from the bottomless pit.</P>
<P>But least I seem too tedious upon one Subject, I shall beg your <HI>Lordships</HI> liberty, to interpose for your Divertisement, this pleasant <HI>Interlude,</HI> the contemplation where|of may recreate the mind, and have its own
<PB REF="4">
usefulness. That brave <HI>Athenian Orator De|mosthenes</HI> writes, that there was a standing Ordinance among the <HI>Locrians</HI> a people in <HI>Greece,</HI> that whosoever desired a new Law to be made he should make an overture there|of to the whole Assembly with a rope about his neck. If it was Judged profitable for the Publick-Good, the Author was assoild, and got the thanks of the house. If not, he was instantly strangled. By this means for the space of 200 years and more, no new Law was made, save this only that follows. It was a received custome there, that if any man should strick out his neighbours eye; his on the other part was to be stricken out likewise, in imitation of <HI>Lex Talionis.</HI> Nei|ther was this crime to be expiated by any sacrifice, nor redeemed by any summ of Money or Gold, how great soever. A certain man who had but one eye, was threatned by his Adversary with the loss of it. This man taking it grievously, and judging the want of his sight more bitter than death, adven|tur'd with a halter about his neck to offer this new Law to the Senate, <HI>viz.</HI> that who|soever should strick out his neighbours eye, who had but one, he should be requited with the lose of both his, as a just recom|pence; that the one might share equally
<PB REF="4">
with the other in the same calamity. The Law was approven and Ratified by the whole meeting. <HI>Demosthenes</HI> relates this, teaching that in a well ordered City; Magi|strates should take special care that new Laws be not rashly made or changed. But I return thither whence the famous <HI>Orator</HI> hath led me aside by this digression.</P>
<P>I cannot but now after these wieghty per|swasives, make my next application for Ac|ceptance, and seriously entreat, that this little Book, if not for the value of the thing offered, yet for its design, which is that <HI>Truth may have victory over Error,</HI> and for the ingenuity and affection it flows from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In mag|nis volu|isse satest.</NOTE>, may be received into the tuition of your favour, and get a full protection against the <HI>Champi|ons</HI> of the <HI>uncircumcised Philistimes,</HI> and be|ing enlightned with the splendor of your <HI>Lordships</HI> name, and receiving the impression of the <HI>Councils</HI> Authority upon it, may by the Lords blessing, be useful to young Stu|dents in Religion, and others too.

<HEAD>TO THE HONEST HEARTED READER</HEAD>
<P>THE two great Pillars upon which the kingdom of Satan is erected, and by which it is upheld, are Ignorance and Errour. And the two great Pillars which support the Kingdom of Christ, are Knowledge and Truth. Therefore our blessed Saviour resolving to subvert the kingdom of Satan among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> tells the Apostle in his first Commission, that he was about to send him <HI>to open their eyes</HI> (namely their un|derstanding) <HI>by the Preaching and Know|ledge of the Gospel, and to turn them from darkness to light, from natural blindness and worldly ignorance, unto the right and true knowledge of GOD.</HI> This is the first step of our <HI>Manumission</HI> from that spiritual thraldom. The Understanding is the Guide, and Pilot of the whole man. It is that faculty which sits at the helme of the Soul. But as the most skilful Pilot
<PB REF="6">
may mistake his course in the dark, so may the Un|derstanding when it wants the light of Knowledge. This is an accomplishment so desirable, that the De|vil knew not a more alluring bate to tempt our first Parents in Paradise, <HI>Ye shall be as Gods</HI> (sayes he) <HI>knowing good and evil.</HI> When the Lord had refer'd it to <HI>Solomons</HI> option, what to choose, he choose Wisdom and Knowledge. When once the Devil understood, that by the Preaching of the Gospel, his kingdom was ruined, he invents two new stratagems to overthrow Religion, even in the infan|cy and beginning of it, to wit Persecution and Here|sie. Open persecution began in <HI>Nero,</HI> a very imp and graff of the Devil. When this <HI>Hirricano,</HI> and many others of that kind were past, and when the Churches of Christ were once at rest, he sends in a Deluge of <HI>Arianism,</HI> which in a short time so prodigiously spread, and over-ran the Christian World, that it seemed to carry all before it, an as|sault, that did not strike at the uppermost boughs of Religion, but at the Root and Beeing of Chri|stianity. But this second proved more sad than the first; for, where Persecution kills one thousand, He|resie kills ten thousand. The one is the <HI>Wild-Boar</HI> of the Forrest, the other is the little <HI>Fox,</HI> that eat|eth up the Grapes of the Lords Vineyard. The one kills the bodies of Men and Women, the other poison|eth the Souls of Christians.</P>
<P>In times of greater Light, as these and former
<PB REF="6">
times have been reputed to be, <HI>Satan</HI> comes not abroad usually to deceive with his gross forgeries, and cloven foot: for every one almost would discern his haltings, but with more mystical, yet strong|delusions, and invincible chains of darkness, where|with he binds his captives the faster to the judge|ment of the great day. And therefore the <HI>Watch word</HI> given in the bright and shining times of the <HI>Apostles was</HI> to try the <HI>Spirits, and believe not every Spirit, and take heed of Spirits,</HI> who indeed were only fleshly and corrupt men yet called Spirits, because they pretended to have much of the Spirit, and their doctrine seemed only to advance the Spirit, the fitest and fairest <HI>cob|webs</HI> to deceive and inveigle the world in these dis|cerning times, that possibly could be spun&punc; out of the poysonful bowels of corrupt and fleshly men: for <HI>Heresie</HI> is a work of the flesh.</P>
<P>The times are now come, wherein by the refined mystical divinity of the old <HI>Moncks,</HI> all the ordi|nances of Christ in the <HI>New Testament</HI> are <HI>allegorized and spiritualized</HI> out of the world. They reject the outward word, because of an in|ward teaching. They reject the outward <HI>Baptism,</HI> be|cause of the inward <HI>Baptism.</HI> They reject the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> because of the spiritual bread from hea|ven the <HI>Lord Jesus.</HI> They abolish the outward Sabbath, because of a spiritual and inward Sab|bath of rest in the bosome of Christ. This is very
<PB REF="7">
consistent with the observing the outward Sabbath. But they wickedly sever, and separat what GOD hath joyned together.</P>
<P>But as to what relates to the present <HI>Treatise,</HI> I am not ignorant, that many eminent and learned <HI>Divines,</HI> far beyond whatever I could profess, have beatten this path, and travelled round the world of <HI>Polemick Divinity.</HI> But their writings being so Voluminous and large, that he who desires to have a full sight at one look of the chief controversies, can no more have it, than a man from the Peak of <HI>Te|neriff,</HI> can get a clear sight of the whole Globe of the Earth. Which things, though they be princi|pally worth the knowing, nevertheless, for so much as their number, and variety are an impediment to themselves, and the multiplicity of matter, makes the mind abruptly flit from one thing to another. Therefore I have imitated <HI>Geographers,</HI> who after they have surveyed the whole Globe of the Earth, draw Universal descriptions thereof, and comprehend the the whole image of that great <HI>Terra-queous</HI> Body within a narrow circumference of a <HI>Card</HI> or <HI>Mapp.</HI> In so doing, I may perhaps contribute some what towards the satisfaction of some, who neither can nor are able, to trace the wearisome foot steps, of those eminent Divines, who have written fully.</P>
<P>This <HI>Treatise</HI> being <HI>Historical,</HI> none can expect, but I must have consulted others, and gleaned off their writtings what things were needful. I can|not
<PB REF="7">
here, as in writing <HI>Philosophy,</HI> or any such like <HI>Science,</HI> set up new <HI>Theorems,</HI> or <HI>Axioms,</HI> which have not been heard of before. This were to make a new Religion, a new System, and Body of Divinity, such as some <HI>giddy-headed Hereticks</HI> are thinking upon. I must confine my self to the good old way, and follow the heatten path-road, wherein men of sound principles have walked before me.</P>
<P>This Book is not designed for men of knowledge and learning, who are more conversant in such mat|ters than I am, but for the unlearned and new|beginners, who need to be instructed with the sound principles of the true <HI>Protestant Religi|on.</HI></P>
<P>I hope none will think I have done amiss in menti|oning so many Religions, which had been better un|named (some may think) than named. This might have some weight, if there were no more Religions in the world at this time, but one only, <HI>to wit,</HI> the true <HI>Protestant Religion.</HI> But see|ing I cannot name so many here, as there are this day owned and professed in the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> I cannot be to blame.</P>
<P>This Book will be useful for understanding the <HI>Confession,</HI> and knowing the design of it. For how many read it, and commend it, that never knew the nature of it. Though there be a multipli|city of questions, and many in number, yet all of them
<PB REF="8">
to my best remembrance, are taken word by word out of the <HI>Confession.</HI> The answers are by <HI>Yes,</HI> or <HI>No.</HI> To which are subjoyned immediately the proofs of the <HI>Confession.</HI> These words which are often repeated, <HI>Well then, do not the</HI> Papists <HI>err,</HI> are nothing els but sure Conclusions drawn from two manifest propositions.</P>
<P>The design of this <HI>Treatise</HI> is good. The method is plain and easy. The order of the Questions, fol|low the order of the purposes in the <HI>Confession.</HI> The probations are such, as are made use of in the <HI>Confession,</HI> and by the <HI>Orthodox Divines,</HI> a|gainst the Adversaries. They are either the very words of the <HI>Scripture</HI> in <HI>Terminis,</HI> or such as by good and necessary consequence, are drawn from the Scripture. They pass reckoning for number. Let no man blame me for speaking somewhat for the Truth, because another man hath spoken better. If I have said little in defence if it, I am sure I have said nothing against it; as the <HI>Apostle</HI> says, <HI>We can do nothing against the truth, but for it.</HI> If I cannot please all men, I shall endeavour at least to please some. And if I can please none, I shall not displease my self. I hope my friends will censure favourably, if my enemies censure maliciously. I expect as many Adversaries of one sort, and of another upon my top, as a travelling man hath midges and wasps about his head in a warm summer even|ing. There are escapes in Authors, whose know|ledge
<PB REF="8">
is far beyond any thing I can profess. No mar|vel then, if a malicious <HI>Critick,</HI> like a viper from the fire of contention fasten upon a mans hand. For the Author being intent upon all, cannot lay out his whole industry upon every line, which a snarling Cur will bark at. I shal take it as a favour to have Learned and Iudicious men to censure me. <HI>Re|prove one</HI> (says <HI>Solomon) that hath un|derstanding, and he will understand know|ledge.</HI> Some perhaps may look awry upon me, be|cause I have medled with some ticklish Questions, and been too positive in my Iudgement. If any such Questions are, they have occur'd to me in the Road, which I could not pass by, without a Salutation. But as all of them have been weighed in the <HI>Ballance of the Sanctuary,</HI> so these like|wise, which some may call ticklish. I durst not for a world have been positive, if I had not judged them consonant to Truth, Therefore let all men, whatever perswasions they be of, judge charitably: for I have said nothing upon the account of fead or favour, <HI>nor any thing which may cause divisi|on or offence. For they that are such serve not our</HI> Lord Iesus Christ, <HI>but their own belly; and by good words, and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. Rom. 16. 18.</HI> But I wish all who profess themselves to own the true <HI>Protest|ant Religion,</HI> were owning the sound principles of the <HI>Confession,</HI> and were sutable and conse|quential
<PB REF="9">
to them in their opinions and practises, and had not given too just cause and occasion to others to reproach all honest hearted men, as being of se|ditions and disloyal principles.</P>
<P>It is probable, I may be less noticed by the common Adversaries, than by some who are so vain that they glory in injuring the Merit of a Book. For as a Gentleman of great Parts and Learning says well in his reflections upon one of his late pieces, <HI>the meanest Rogue may burn a City, or kill an Hero, whereas he could never have built the one, or equaled the other.</HI></P>
<P>As the method is plain and easy, so is the stile. I use only the common and plain Arguments. Some perhaps might have expected a dilution, or answer|ing of the Adversaries Reasons. It is hard to pro|pose them to their Palate. They complain their arguments are enervate and clipped. Neither is it expedient to bring forth from the Devils Armory and Magazin his fiery darts. In confuting the Adversaries, I use no worse language than <HI>Do not they err.</HI> Sometimes I treat the <HI>Quakers</HI> with such language, as they use against others. Though they look like Lambs, yet gall them but a little, and you will find them express the Matulent and Teen of their heart. And as <HI>Cacus</HI> spouted fire against <HI>Hercules,</HI> who persued him as a Theif, so will they against all who persue them as Hereticks.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1662. I published a little Book intitu|led
<PB REF="9">
<HI>Tyrocinia Mathematica,</HI> for the use of my <HI>Schollars,</HI> and young <HI>Students,</HI> which was dedi|cated to that great <HI>Hero, John Duke of Lauder|dail. Anno</HI> 1669, I had a large Book printed in <HI>Holland</HI> dedicated to the <HI>Earle of Winton.</HI> In the year 1672, a third was published, intituled the <HI>Hydrostaticks.</HI> Though some endeavoured to ruin the reputation of my Writings at home, yet they were not able to do it abroad. But least this peece may meet with the like welcome into the world, I shall beg liberty to cite one passage of a letter from a most intelligent Gentleman, in vindication of that Book intituled <HI>Ars Nova &amp; Magna,</HI> against which so many flate contradictions were uttered, which the other two likewise met with.</P>
<P><HI>Ostend,</HI> October 10. 1670. <HI>I must not for|get to tell you a passage anent your late peece. When we were at</HI> Breda, <HI>we had oc|casion to see</HI> Collonel Lauther, <HI>who fell in re|grating that</HI> Scots Spirits <HI>were not encouraged. And told he had seen a Book lately published by one</HI> Sinclar, <HI>whereof he had a great e|steem, and that many others as well as he esteemed it highly. For example, he told of a</HI> Dutchman&punc; <HI>who is one of the</HI> French Virtuosi, <HI>that said he had seen nothing on that subject com|parable to it; and it was esteemed so in</HI> France. <HI>If you have any other thing to pub|lish,</HI>
<PB REF="10">
<HI>I pray you hasten it, for it will not want acceptance.</HI> This testimony was homologate after|wards by that famous <HI>Virtuoso,</HI> and <HI>Mathema|tician, Christopher Sturmius,</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> in his Book intituled <HI>Collegium Curiosum&punc;</HI> which some here have seen. He hath gone thorow the Book diligently, and gleaned the finest purposes in it, and sent them abroad, not as his own Inventions, but as mine, which he would never have done, if the Experiments had been all of them either <HI>Un|truths</HI> and <HI>Lies,</HI> or not <HI>New,</HI> and <HI>unheard</HI> off. This testimony from a Stranger, vindicates suffici|ently. The rest of my writings are likewise com|mended by <HI>Mr. Boile, Sir Frances Hales, Doct. Glanvil,</HI> and others, men of eminent skill and knowledge in such matters, as I treat of.</P>
<P>In going thorow this Book, you will find the <HI>Pa|pists</HI> confuted upon threescore and fourteen several heads. The <HI>Quakers</HI> upon thirty and two. The <HI>Socinians</HI> upon fourty and seven. The <HI>Lutheri|ans</HI> upon thirteen. The <HI>Antinomians</HI> upon as many. The <HI>Anabaptists</HI> upon thirty and two. The <HI>Arminians</HI> upon twenty and seven. The rest are confuted, some upon fewer; some upon more heads; and that only according to their chief and grand Errors. For a man to confute all and every one of their false and absurd Tenets, would be a task, like the cleanseing of <HI>Augeas</HI> King of <HI>Elis</HI> his <HI>Ox|stall,</HI> which none but <HI>Hercules</HI> was able to do.
<PB REF="10">
Neither would it be worth the while, seeing by the confutation of those mentioned, you may the more easily confute the rest. If any be too curious to inquire, why the Author hath touched so many controver|sies in Religion, and yet hath medled nothing with the great controversie of the time. I answer, I had been both officious and impertinent to have touched matters, which lay not in my way. For in all the <HI>Confession,</HI> which is the onlie Road I walk in, there is not one Mum or Syllable of the one Govern|ment, or of the other.</P>
<P>The Book for <HI>Paper</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> may com|pare with many from abroad. The <HI>Printer</HI> a Person of special skill, hath done his dutie sufficient|lie in correcting; so that I find it needless to prefix or subjoyn <HI>Errata Corrigenda.</HI> If there be any <HI>Literal faults,</HI> which the most skilful <HI>Author,</HI> and best of <HI>Printers</HI> cannot prevent, let the <HI>Reader</HI> im|pute them only to invincible necessity.</P>
<P><HI>Our good Lord, whose Prerogative it is to teach, to profit, bless this little Book, that it may be to thee as a light shining in a dark place, untill the day dawn and the day star arise in thy heart, that thereby thou mayest grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI></P>

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, none can be saved, unless they be born again, by the incorruptible seed of the Word. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 23. (2) Because, Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and no man cometh to the Father, but by the Son, <HI>Iohn</HI> 14. 6. (3) Because, there is none other Name under Heaven, given among men whereby we must be saved, but by the Name of Jesus, <HI>Acts</HI> 4. 12. (4) Because, men cannot believe in Christ without <HI>supernatural revelation:</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="17">
and therefore cannot be sanctified or justified; because all Justification, Sanctification, and Remission of sins, are by GODS Grace, and Faith in Jesus Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 24, 25. <HI>Acts.</HI> 26. 18. Neither can men be so saved, <HI>viz.</HI> by liv|ing according to the light of Nature, because Salvation is promised onely to Believers in Christ, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 31. <HI>Iohn</HI> 3. 16. (5.)

Men destitute of supernatural Revelation cannot know their own corruption and misery, by the first <HI>Adam,</HI> nor the remedy which is offer|ed by Christ, the <HI>second Adam.</HI> They are with|out GOD, without Hope, without the Promi|ses, without the Church, and covenant of God: and the mysteries of Faith are hid, and un|known to them allanerly, that perish, and are lost, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 11, 12. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 3. <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. 11, 12. <HI>Matth.</HI> 11. 25, 26, 27.</P>

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1.) Because, the Scriptures are the founda|tion, upon which the Church is built. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 20. (2.) Because, all things are to be examined, by the Rule of the Word; as the noble <HI>Bereans</HI> did, <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 11, 12. (3) Because, unwritten Traditions, are subject and lyable to many corruptions, and are soon, and quickly for|gotten. (4.) Because, we have Life Eternal in the Scriptures; therefore they must be most necessary to the Church, <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. 39. (5.)

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1.) Because, Christ says, if he called them Gods, unto whom the <HI>Word of GOD</HI> came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 10. 35. Here it is evident, that the <HI>Word of GOD,</HI> and the Scripture, are the same. (2.) Because, the predictions of the Prophets, are expresly called the <HI>Word of GOD.</HI> Now in the first year of <HI>Cyrus</HI> king of <HI>Persia,</HI> that the Word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of <HI>Ieremiah</HI> might be accomplished, 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 36. 22. Here we see it is evident, that the written Prophesies of <HI>Ieremiah,</HI> which are a part of the holy Scrip|ture, are called the <HI>Word of GOD.</HI> (3.) Be|cause, what Christ calls the commandement of GOD, He calls the <HI>Word of GOD, Mar.</HI> 7. 9, 10. compared with v: 13. (4.) Because, the Apostle calls the sword of the Spirit, the <HI>Word of God.</HI> This sword, is the sword of the Holy Spirit, which he doth, as it were, put into our hand, to re|sist Satan, against all his temptations, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 17. Therefore, by the sword of the Spirit, must be understood the Scripture, not the Spirit it self, as some <HI>Quakers</HI> affirm. It is evident also, from the fourth chapter of <HI>Matthew,</HI> where Christ being tempted by the Devil, with three

different temptations; resists him with three different places of Scripture. And being as|ked by the Pharisees, why his Disciples did pluck the ears of Corn upon the Sabbath day; answered by Scripture. <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 1, 2, 3, 4. Teaching us, that Satans temptations, must be carefully answered, and that by Scripture, as the onely mean to overcome him, and his Instruments. (5.) Because, the <HI>Word of GOD,</HI> is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 12. This cannot be understood of Christ, because <HI>Paul</HI> in his other writings doth not call the Person of Christ by this name, and therefore must be understood of the word of the Gospel, the power whereof is described, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 16. (6.) See these follow|ing places of Scripture, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119. 172. 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 16. 12. and 2 <HI>Kin.</HI> 9. 36. and 2 <HI>Kin.</HI> 23. 16. <HI>Isa.</HI> 28. 13. <HI>Hos.</HI> 1. 1, 2. <HI>Isa.</HI> 37. 22. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30. 5. By the Scripture, or Word of GOD, we do not understand the bare letters, or the several written words of the holy Scripture, which the Adversaries may imagine, we call the Word of GOD.

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) From the places of Scripture already cited. (2) From the Apostolical Bene|diction, in which the three Persons of the God-head, are called upon expresly: 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 14. (3) From, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 4, 5, 6. Where the three Persons, are named <HI>Spirit, Lord, God.</HI> And from <HI>Iohn</HI> 15. 26. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth. (4) Because, there are three, that bear record in heaven, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>holy Spirit.</HI> 1 <HI>Iohn&punc;</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="29">
5. 7. These three, must be either three Per|sons, or three Gods. This last, is the hight of impossibility; therefore they must be three Persons. Here they are put to silence, and have nothing to reply; such is the strength, and power of Truth, which is able to stop the mouths of the greatest rebels against religion and reason. But there is good ground for the word <HI>Person, Heb.</HI> 1. 3. where Christ is said to be the express <HI>Image,</HI> or <HI>impression</HI> of the <HI>Fathers Person.</HI> Because, the Person of the Son, perfectly represents the Person of the Father, as an Impression doth the Seal: wherefore he is also called the <HI>image of the invisible GOD, Col.</HI> 1. 15. The <HI>Greek</HI> word is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Subsistence,</HI> or <HI>Person,</HI> whereby is understood, the Person of the Fa|ther as distinct from the Son, and subsists of himself, and in himself, and is, as the Original of the Person of the Son, by an <HI>eternal and in|effable generation.</HI> That there are three <HI>Persons</HI> in the <HI>Godhead;</HI> it is further evident, (1) from all the Epistles, written to the seven Churches of <HI>Asia.</HI> For, as may be gathered from <HI>Rev.</HI> 1. 1. it is the <HI>Father</HI> that sends, it is the <HI>Son</HI> that gives <HI>Iohn</HI> the Commission, and it is the <HI>holy Ghost</HI> in the close, that is mentioned as a joynt speaker. (2) Because, in that E|pistle written to <HI>Thyatira,</HI> there are three di|stinctly
<PB N="25" REF="29">
named, first, the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> in these words, <HI>these things saith the Son of God.</HI> Next, there is named in the last verse of that second chapter, the <HI>Spirit, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.</HI> (3) Because, in the beginning of that Epistle to the Church of <HI>Sardis,</HI> they are all three put together, <HI>these things saith He,</HI> (to wit, the <HI>Son) that hath the seven Spirits of GOD.</HI> Here, <HI>GOD,</HI> that is the <HI>Father,</HI> is di|stinctly considered, as another <HI>Person.</HI> The seven <HI>spirits,</HI> are the <HI>holy Ghost.</HI> (4) Because, these three <HI>Persons</HI> are most fully and clearly distinguished in the fifth chapter. First, the <HI>Father</HI> sitting on the Throne. Secondly, the <HI>Lamb,</HI> or the <HI>Son of GOD:</HI> And thirdly, the <HI>se|ven Spirits,</HI> or the <HI>holy Ghost,</HI> so called from the pouring out of his Gifts upon the Churches, in that aboundant manner, as if he were <HI>seven Spirits,</HI> or a <HI>sevenfold Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>It is evident also, that the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> are really distinct from one another, and are three <HI>Persons.</HI> They are indeed in respect of their Essence, which is indivisibly communicable to them, One and the same GOD; but considered Personally, they dif|fer really, for the <HI>Father</HI> is not the <HI>Son,</HI> nei|ther is he, that sits upon the Throne, the <HI>Lamb.</HI> Neither the <HI>Father,</HI> nor the <HI>Spirit</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="30">
were <HI>incarnate,</HI> but the <HI>Son,</HI> who died, and was buried, which can be said of none, but of a <HI>Person.</HI> It cannot be said that the <HI>Father</HI> died, or that the <HI>Spirit</HI> died. Next, is not the <HI>holy Ghost</HI> the <HI>spirit</HI> of GOD, as the <HI>Son</HI> is the <HI>Son</HI> of GOD? And if that, suppose, a real di|stinct personality, this must do it also. Now if the Father be God, and the Son be God, and the Spirit God also, who have one, and the same divine nature, and essence indivi|sibly communicated to them; and so, if there be but one God, and yet these three really distinct, then they must be distinct <HI>per|sons,</HI> in respect of their Personal properties, seing they are <HI>Persons,</HI> and distinct. The Son, (as was said) is called the <HI>express Image of the Fathers Person,</HI> which evidently shews, that the <HI>Father,</HI> considered as distinct from the <HI>Son,</HI> is a <HI>Person,</HI> and subsists. If then, thus it be, must not the <HI>Son,</HI> as distinct from the <HI>Father,</HI> and so lively and expresly representing his <HI>person,</HI> be a <HI>person</HI> also, having this from the <HI>Father?</HI> The same must be true likewise, of the <HI>holy Ghost,</HI> who is GOD equal with both, yet different from both; for he who proceedeth from the <HI>Father,</HI> and from the <HI>Son,</HI> must differ from the <HI>Father,</HI> and from the <HI>Son;</HI> as he who is begotten, must be di|stinct from him that begat him.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="30">Some <HI>Quakers</HI> either ignorantly, or per|versely, will have the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, transla|ted <HI>substance,</HI> (as it is <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 1.) and thus they read, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 3. <HI>the Character or Image of GODS substance,</HI> which is to be understood of <HI>Christ,</HI> (say they) not simply as GOD, but as <HI>Man.</HI> But they might as well have said, it signifies <HI>confident,</HI> or <HI>confidence,</HI> because it is so translated, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 4. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 17. But they speak here consequentially to their own Tenets, who in effect deny the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and all distinction between the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>holy Ghost,</HI> not only in words, but in very deed. The Apostle in this place, is proving <HI>Christ</HI> the Son of GOD, to be <HI>Lord,</HI> and <HI>Heir</HI> of all things; because, GOD created the <HI>Worlds by him; He is the brightness of his glory, the express Image of his person, upholdeth all things by the Word of his power.</HI> These Titles are here given to the <HI>Son of GOD,</HI> as a <HI>Creator,</HI> and a <HI>Preserver</HI> of all things, which belong to him only, according to his <HI>Divine Nature:</HI> therefore these Titles must be understood of Christ, forasmuch, as he is the <HI>eternal Son of GOD,</HI> and a Light from the Eternal Light, of one Essence, and Glory with the Father; nevertheless distinguished from the <HI>Person</HI> of the <HI>Father,</HI> by whom the <HI>Father</HI> executes his Operations, and shews his Properties, even as the <HI>Sun</HI> by its light doth shine.</P>

<P><HI>DId God from all eternity, by the most holy, and wise Counsel of his Will, freely and unchange|ably ordain whatsoever comes to pass?</HI> Yes. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 11. <HI>Romans</HI> 11. 33. <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 17. <HI>Romans</HI> 9. 15. 18.</P>

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1.) From the knowledge of God, where|by from all eternity, he hath known all things infallibly, which come to pass, or shall be in time. <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 18. <HI>Iohn</HI> 21. 17. <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 13. But all things, which come to pass in time, could not have been infallibly known from eternity, but in the Decree of his di|vine Will. (2.) From Gods natural way
<PB N="32" REF="33">
of working in time: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 6. <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 36. whence it is evident, that God worketh effect|ually, and immediately in time all things which are done: but he worketh by his will those things, which he will have to be in time (after that manner, and in that time, how, and when they come to pass) <HI>Psal.</HI> 115. 3. But that Act of willing, cannot happen to God in time, but hath been in him from all eternity, because God is un|changeable, <HI>Iames</HI> 1. 17. (3) By enume|rating several instances, concerning which, the Scripture affirms particularly, that they have been decreed by GOD, as the suffer|ings and death of Christ, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 23. The glorifying of those, that are to be saved. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 4, 5. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 9. And the foreordaining the rest to damnation to be punished for their sin; <HI>Iude</HI> v. 4.

<P><HI>By what arguments are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) From the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> who maketh the good will and pleasure of God, the on|ly cause, why this man is chosen, and an|other, as worthy rejected, and casten off; <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Where he moves an objection, against the justice of God, and answers it. (2) Because, our blessed Saviour assignes it, to the good will and plea|sure of God; that to some, the mysteries of Faith, for their conversion are revealed, and that they are hid from many others, who are nothing worse, but in some respect better; <HI>Matth.</HI> 11. 25, 26.

<P>(1.) Because, Christ thanked his Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because he had hid those things from the wise and prudent,

Be|cause, in a great house, there are some ves|sels to honour, some to dishonour; 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 19, 20. (4.) Because, the Apostle <HI>Iude</HI> says, there are some, who of old were ordain|ed to this condemnation, ungodly men. Note, that the cause of this reprobation, is not mans sin, but the absolute will, and good pleasure of God. Mans sin indeed is the cause, why God will punish, but no oc|casion, why he did ordain, to pass by, or to punish man. This Decree is just, because God has power over man, as the Potter hath power over the clay. Neither is the end of this Decree the condemnation of the crea|ture

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>There are here two parts to be considered; First, the <HI>Negative, That the Legal Sacrifices did not foresignifie.</HI> The second, the <HI>Affirmative, that they did truely make a real expiation and</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="42">
<HI>atonement.</HI> The first is evidently confuted from Scripture Testimonies; for the Law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things, can never with those Sacrifices which they offered year by year, continually, make the Comers thereunto perfect; <HI>Heb:</HI> 10: 4. The Apostle calls here, these Legal Sacrifices, <HI>a Shadow:</HI> and <HI>Heb:</HI> 9: 9: he calls them <HI>a Figure:</HI> and verse 24, he calls them <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Exemplaria verorum,</HI> the Figures of the <HI>True;</HI> and <HI>Col:</HI> 2: 17: he calls them <HI>a shadow of things to come,</HI> but the Body is of Christ, which is no|thing else, but that the thing signified is of Christ: that is to say, fulfilled in Christ. For all the <HI>shadows</HI> of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> had a respect to Christ, and his Benefits; by whose coming they also have an end. And <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 17. it is said, <HI>That the Law was given by</HI> Moses, <HI>but Grace and Truth came by Iesus Christ.</HI> By Grace, understand the Grace of Redemption, from the curse of the Law; <HI>Gal:</HI> 3. 13. and of Adoption for Children; <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 12. <HI>Rom:</HI> 8. 15. By Truth, understand the fulfilling both of the Promises, 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 1. 20. and of the Cere|monies, and Types; <HI>Col:</HI> 2. 17. For this cause the Apostles have alwayes pressed, the Abro|gation of the Legal Rites, and Ceremonies; because the Truth being exhibited, by the
<PB N="52" REF="43">
coming of the <HI>Anti-type,</HI> the shadows of the Type, ought deservedly to cease, and be no more: according to that of <HI>Daniel</HI> 9. 27.</P>
<P>The second part is likewise evidently con|futed; namely, <HI>that the Legal Sacrifices did truely and really purge away all the sins, for which they were offered.</HI> (1) Because, the Apostle sayes, <HI>the blood of Bulls, and Goats, cannot take away sin; Heb:</HI> 10: 4. (2) Because, those <HI>Sa|crifices were not able to make him that did the ser|vice perfect; Heb:</HI> 9: 9. (3) Because, these Legal Sacrifices did leave the sins of such as offered, unexpiated, until they were purged away by the death, and blood of Christ; <HI>Heb:</HI> 9. 15. (4) Because, the sins of Believers, under the <HI>Old Testament</HI> were forgiven and pardoned after the same manner, that our sins under the <HI>New Testament</HI> are pardoned; <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 11.</P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, in both the Covenants there is the same promise of Grace, concerning re|mission of sins, and life Eternal freely to be given to Believers, for Christs sake; <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 15. where the <HI>seed of the Woman,</HI> is promised to bruise the <HI>head of the Serpent:</HI> and <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7. it is said, <HI>I shall be thy GOD, and the GOD of thy seed after thee;</HI> and <HI>Gen.</HI> 22. 18. it is said, <HI>in thy seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be bles|sed:</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> 3. 36. it is said, <HI>he that believeth, hath Everlasting life:</HI> And <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 11. it is said, <HI>but we believe, that through the Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, we shall be saved, even as they.</HI> (2) Because, one, and the same Faith, and O|bedience, on both sides, is required; <HI>walk be|fore me, and be thou perfect, Gen.</HI> 17. 1. and <HI>Mark</HI> 1. 15.

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="45"><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ is said to be made of a Woman; <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 4. (2) Because, the <HI>Word</HI> was made <HI>Flesh; Iohn</HI> 1. 4. (3) By an indu|ction of the essential parts of a Man, and sin|less infirmities, which were found in him. First, He was endued with a rational Soul; <HI>Iohn</HI> 12. 27. Secondly, He had a real and substantial Body, and denyed he was a Spi|rit only; <HI>Luke</HI> 24. 39. Thirdly, Christ did hunger; <HI>Mat.</HI> 4. 2. Fourthly, He was weari|ed, and thirsty; <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 6. Lastly, He was sad&punc; <HI>he groaned in Spirit, and was troubled; Iohn</HI> 11. 33. and verse 15. <HI>He wept.</HI> None of which sinless perturbations, can agree to an Appearance, Shape, or Form of a Man.

(5) Because, the promises were made in the seed of <HI>Abraham; Gen.</HI> 12. 3. and <HI>Gen.</HI> 18. 18. (6) Because, He took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the seed of <HI>Abraham, where|fore in all things, it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren; Heb.</HI> 2. 16, 17.

<P>Yes: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 6. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 5.</P>
<P>Well then, do not the <HI>Nestorians</HI> err, who maintain, <HI>the Union between the Divine and Hu|mane Nature, not to be</HI> Hypostatical, <HI>but only by way of Assistence: and that, as there are two Na|tures in Christ, so there are two Persons, one proper to the Divine Nature, another proper to the Humane Nature?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, unless <HI>Christ-God-Man</HI> were but one Person, the Merit of his Death, would not be of so great value, as to redeem the Elect from infinite, and eternal punish|ment: seeing hence cometh, all the value, and worth of his death, that the same Per|son, who was God, did suffer, and die for us. (2) Because, otherwise, Christ had been swallowed up, and devoured by the wrath of God, against the sins of the Elect, which he himself undertook. (3) Because, Christ, if he had not been both God and Man, in one Person, he could not have been a Me|diator: for a Mediator must be One; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 5.</P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, such a <HI>Composition,</HI> is impos|sible, seing the Divine Nature, is most perfect, and cannot lose any, of its own per|fection, unless we would affirm, the Divine Nature, to be mutable, and changeable. (2) Because, that same Christ, who accord|ing to the Flesh descended of the <HI>Iews,</HI> is over all, <HI>God blessed for ever; Rom.</HI> 9. 5. (3) Be|cause, this doctrine takes away all means of Mediation: for, by taking away the distincti|on between the Natures, they take away the Natures themselves: and so neither could Christ have suffered in our place, because not Man: neither could he have given any vertue, value, or worth, to his sufferings, because not God.</P>

<P>Well then, do not the <HI>Papists</HI> err, who maintain, <HI>that the soul of Christ, even from its first creation, was never affected with any sadness, or sinless perturbation of mind?</HI></P>

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Scripture testifies, that his soul was sad unto death; <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 37.

(3) Be|cause, his soul, was exceeding sorrowful, e|ven unto death, as was cited before, <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 37. (4) The same thing is proven from Christs desertion, whereby the actual fruiti|on, and enjoying of Gods favour, as to his sense, was interrupted, and broken in the midst for a time, but in no wise, altogether taken away, which made him cry upon the Cross: <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou for|saken Me.

<HI>himself, which he through the eternal Spirit, once offered up unto God, fully satisfied, the Iustice of his Father?</HI></P>
<P>Yes: <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 9. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 25, 26. <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 14, 16. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 14.</P>
<P>Well then, do not some, otherwise <HI>Ortho|dox</HI> err, who deny, Christs <HI>Active Obedience, to be a part of his satisfaction, performed in our place?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Active disobedience of the first <HI>Adam</HI> made us all sinners: therefore we must be made Righteous, by the Active O|bedience of the second <HI>Adam; Rom.</HI> 5. 19. (2) Because, Christ not only offered himself to the death for us, but for their sakes (that is, for the Elects sake) he sanctified himself (that is, he gave up himself, as a holy sacri|fice) <HI>Iohn</HI> 17. 19. (3) Because, it behoved Christ to fulfil all righteousness; <HI>Mat.</HI> 3. 15. (4) Because, we stood in need; not only of the expiation of sin, for saving us from eter|nal death, but of the gift of righteousness, for obtaining eternal life, according to that precept and demand of the Law, <HI>Do this, and thou shalt live.</HI> And therefore Christ is not only called our <HI>Ransom,</HI> but the end and perfection of the Law, to every one, that
<PB N="61" REF="47">
believeth <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 4. That is, the aim of giving the Law by <HI>Moses,</HI> is that, thereby men being brought to the knowledge of their sin, should flie for refuge unto Christ, and his righteousness, as he that hath perfectly fulfilled the Law for us. (5) Because, the passive obedience of Christ, was not in it self meerly and purely passive, but his active obedience did challenge the chief, and prin|cipal part in it. <HI>Psal.</HI> 40. 7. Then said I, <HI>lo, I come,: in the volume of the book, it is written of Me.</HI> With these words, our Saviour Christ declareth his willing Obedience, to accept of, undergo, and execute the <HI>Mediatorship,</HI> by GOD imposed upon him. And (<HI>Isaiah</HI> 53. 7.) he offered up himself a sacrifice for sin, and by one Oblation, he hath <HI>perfected for ever them that are sanctified; Heb.</HI> 10. 14. (6) Be|cause, <HI>whole Christ</HI> was given to us, with all his benefits: otherwise, if onely his passive Obedience were imputed to us, it would fol|low, that <HI>half Christ</HI> onely were given; to wit, <HI>Christ suffering,</HI> but not <HI>Christ doing</HI> those things which pleased the <HI>Father;</HI> taking away our sin, and saving from death onely, but not bringing Righteousness. But Christ was not given, and born for himself, but for us, that he might bestow himself wholly upon us, by doing for us, what we could not do, and by
<PB N="62" REF="48">
suffering for us, what we could not suffer.</P>
<P><HI>Do not likewise the</HI> Socinians <HI>err,</HI> who main|tain, <HI>That this Orthodox Doctrine, (namely, That Christ did merit Eternal Salvation, to the Elect, and hath satisfied Divine Iustice for them;) is erroneous, false, and absurd?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the <HI>Messiah</HI> doth finish the transgression, and maketh an end of sins, and maketh Reconciliation for iniquity, and shal be cut off, but not for himself, as the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> hath foretold; chap. 9. 24, 26. (2) Be|cause, his own self bare our sins in his own Bo|dy, upon the tree; 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 2. 24. (3) Be|cause, he hath reconciled those to GOD, that were sometimes alienated, and enemies in their mind, by wicked works, in the body of his Flesh through death; <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 21, 22. (4) Because, now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared, to put away sin, by the sa|crifice of himself; <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 26. (5) Because, he hath given his life, an <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>a pretium redemptionis, a price of Redemption</HI> for many.

<P>Well then, do not the <HI>Papists</HI> err, who maintain, <HI>that Christ is a Mediator only accord|ing to his humane Nature?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, it was needful, for perfect|ing the work of the Mediator, that Christ should overcome death; which could not otherwise be done, than by his Divine Na|ture; 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 18. Where it is said, he was put to death in the Flesh, but quickned by the Spirit. (2) Because, there are very ma|ny properties of the Mediator, which cannot in any wise agree to the humane Nature of Christ, <HI>as undertaking, and promising, that he will raise up all at the last day, whom the Father has given him; Iohn</HI> 6. 39. Again, he could not lay down his life, and take it up again, by the alone strength of his humane Nature: but all these are works proper to the Medi|ator; as is clear from the tenth chapter of <HI>Iohn</HI> v. 18. And (3) the application of those good things, which he hath merited, is the proper work of the Mediator, which can
<PB N="64" REF="49">
only be done, by the Divine Nature. (4) Because, Christ is a Prophet, a Priest, and a King, according to both his Natures. A Prophet; <HI>Matt.</HI> 11. 27. No man knoweth the Father, save the Son. A Priest; <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 10. <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 14. He is a King; <HI>Luke</HI> 1. 32. All which Offices, he executes according to both his Natures.</P>

For we know here but in part, and therefore we love but in part: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 9.

<P><HI>DOth GOD take away from them, whom he effectually Calls, the heart of stone, and give unto them an heart of flesh, renew|ing their wills, and by his Almighty power, de|termining them, to that which is good, and effect|ually drawing them to Iesus Christ?</HI></P>

<HI>is not renewed, nor furnished with any new and Spiritual qualities?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, <HI>Moses</HI> sayes, <HI>GOD</HI> shal cir|cumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live; <HI>Deu.</HI> 30. 6. (2) Because, the Lord says, A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and will take away the stony heart out of your flesh; and I will give you an heart of flesh: and I will put my Spirit within you; and cause you to walk in my sta|tutes, and cause you to keep my judgements, and do them; <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36. 26, 27. (3) Because, It is GOD, that worketh in us, both to will, and to do, according to his good pleasure; Phil. 2. 13. (4) Because, all the faculties of the Soul are renewed; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 17.

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="53">(1) Because, if this Doctrine were true, a mans conversion, would be of him that run|neth, and of him that willeth, but not of GOD, that sheweth mercy; which is contra|ry to the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 15, 16.

<P><HI>DOTH GOD freely justify those, whom he effectually calleth, not by infusing righte|ousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting, and accepting their persons, as righteous, not for any thing wrought in them,</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="56">
<HI>or done by them, but for Christs sake alone?</HI></P>
<P>Yes: <HI>Rom:</HI> 9: 30: <HI>Rom:</HI> 3: 24:</P>
<P>Well then, do not the <HI>Papists, Socinians,</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI> err, who maintain, <HI>that the righteousness, whereby we are justified before God, is not without us, but within us, and inherent?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, if inherent righteousness, did justify us, then good Works would justify us, but the Scripture denys that; <HI>Rom:</HI> 3: 20: Therefore, (says the Text) <HI>by the deeds of the Law, shall no flesh be justifyed in his sight:</HI> And <HI>verse</HI> 28: therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by Faith without the deeds of the Law. See <HI>Rom:</HI> 4: 6: <HI>Gal:</HI> 2: 16: <HI>Eph.</HI> 2: 8, 9, <HI>Titus</HI> 3: 5: In all which places, works are secluded expresly from our justification. (2) Because, the Righteousness, whereby we are justified, is not our proper own; 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 5: 21: For he (to wit God) hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him; <HI>Phil:</HI> 3: 8, 9: and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by Faith. (3) Because, we are not justified by the Law; <HI>Acts</HI> 13: 38, 39. (4) Because,
<PB N="79" REF="56">
our Justification, is given to us freely; <HI>Rom.</HI> 4: 4, 5. <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 6. (5) Because, our in|herent righteousness, is imperfect, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 8: 46: For this Scripture says, there is no man that sinneth not. See that parallel place; 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 1: 8: <HI>Where it is said,</HI> if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us. (6) Because, if we were justified by inherent righteousness, we would have matter to boast of, which is contrary to <HI>Pauls</HI> doctrine, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2: 9: Not of works, least any man should boast. (7) Because, the righte|ousness of a Christian man, is the justifying of the ungodly. <HI>Rom:</HI> 4: 5.</P>

<HEAD>Quest: II:</HEAD>
<P><HI>DOTH GOD justify men, by im|puting Faith it self, the Act of believing, or any other</HI> Evangelical obedience, <HI>to them, as their righteousness?</HI></P>
<P>No. <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 5, 6, 7, 8. 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 5: 19, 21: <HI>Rom:</HI> 3: 22, 24, 25, 27, 28: <HI>Tit:</HI> 3: 5: 7: <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 7. <HI>Ier:</HI> 23: 6. 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 1. 30, 31: <HI>Rom:</HI> 5: 17, 18, 19.</P>
<P>Well then, do not the <HI>Arminians</HI> err, who maintain, <HI>that Faith it self, and the Act of Believing, is imputed to us for righteousness?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Faith is that <HI>by which,</HI> we re|ceive righteousness; <HI>Acts</HI> 26: 18. Therefore
<PB N="80" REF="57">
if it be that <HI>by which,</HI> we receive righteousness, it cannot be righteousness it self: because, <HI>that which is received,</HI> is far different, and another thing from <HI>that, whereby we receive it.</HI> (2) Because, we are not justified by inherent righ|teousness, as is proven evidently against the <HI>Papists</HI> in the last foregoing Question, all which reasons do clearly evince, that we are not ju|stified by the imputation of Faith it self, or by the act of believing, as our righteousness.</P>

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, as the Body without the Spirit is dead, so Faith without works is dead also; <HI>Iames</HI> 2. 26. (2) Because, Faith worketh by Love; <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 6. that is, by shewing forth the works of Love in us, towards GOD, and our

no man can come to me (that is, <HI>believe</HI>) un|less the Father that hath sent me draw him; <HI>Iohn</HI> 6. 44.

(3) Be|cause, that which is natural, is proper to all; but all men have not Faith; 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3. 2. (4) Because, Faith is reckoned up among the fruits of the Spirit; <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 22.

<P><HI>By what reasons do you confute the</HI> Arminians?</P>
<P>(1) Because, Faith is given to the Elect onely, and to such, as are ordained to life e|ternal; <HI>Titus</HI> 1. 1. <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 48. (2) Because, he that believes, shall be saved; <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. <HI>Iohn</HI> 3. 15, 16, 18, 36.

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, if this be all, that Christ hath purchased by his death, that GOD might save fallen man, upon condition he believe; then Christ might attain his end in dying, and yet not one soul be saved by his death. (2) Because, it makes Christ a Ti|tular Saviour onely, purchasing salvation to all, without any full and certain intention of
<PB N="94" REF="64">
applying it to any. (3) Because, it is pro|mised to Christ the Mediator, as a satisfacti|on to him for his sufferings, that not only many through Faith in him, shall be justifi|ed, but that certainly, he shall see his seed, and the fruit of his Soul; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 53. 10. (4) Because, the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; under which all particular graces may be comprehended, are said to be shed on us aboundantly, through Jesus Christ; <HI>Titus</HI> 3. 5, 6. (5) Because, the Lord hath promised to remove from us, the heart of stone, and to give us a new heart; to cleanse us from all our idols, and wash us with clean water. But these pro|mises are in one bundle, with the promises of his pardoning our iniquity, and remem|bring our sins no more; <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36. 25, 26. <HI>Ierem.</HI> 31. 33, 34.

(7) Be|cause, we are said to be blessed, with all spi|ritual blessings in <HI>Christ Iesus, (Ephes.</HI> 1. 3.) which by his merit are communicated to us. And is not Faith and saving Grace to be ac|counted among the Spiritual blessings? (8)
<PB N="95" REF="64">

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, to believe, is to receive Christ, which is an Act of the Will; <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 12. (2) Because, Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Or <HI>Faith,</HI> is a firm ground, or a firm confidence; that is, which causeth to subsist, or stand firm, the things which are promised by God in Christ, and which therefore are expected by hope, which is not done only by an assent, to Gods promises in our understanding, but also by a trusting to the same in our will.

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Repentance, being a turning from our sins, and evil ways, and a turning to God, and Christ being without sin, could not be capable to repent in our stead; 1 <HI>King.</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="67">
8. 35. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 26, 27. <HI>Ioel</HI> 2. 12, 13. (2) Be|cause, they that repent, confess their sins, and are grieved for them; <HI>Ezra</HI> 10. 1. <HI>Mark</HI> 14. 72. They hate their sins; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 11. They are ashamed, and confounded for them; <HI>Ier.</HI> 31. 19.

They are ashamed, and confounded; <HI>Ier.</HI> 31. 19.

But is any man so foolish as to affirm, that when a man doth mourn, for his first born, he believes only, that another man, hath mourned in

In which places, Faith and Repentance, are numbred two diverse things. And it is e|vident likewise, that Faith is the cause of Re|pentance, but nothing can be the cause of it self.</P>
<P>Do not likewise, the <HI>Papists</HI> err, who maintain, <HI>that we are not by Repentance converted from our sins to God; which they only make an en|dument, or quality fitting, and disposing us for conversion, and meriting it: which (say they) consists in</HI> heart contrition, mouth confession, absolution, and satisfaction. <HI>By the first, They have heart sorrow for sin. By the second, They con|fess their sins to the Preist. By the third, (Which can be no part of Repentance; seeing it is not a thing done by the sinner) they are absolved by the Priest, from theirsins. By the fourth&punc; they make satisfaction for former sins, in performing some good work willingly undertaken, or enjoyned by the Priest after absolution; as Fastings, Chastising of their own bodies, Pilgrimages, and hearing of many Masses</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Word of God asserts no meritorious Work in us, to go before our conversion. Not by Works of righteous|nss,, which we have done, but according
<PB N="102" REF="68">
to his mercy, he saved us; <HI>Titus</HI> 3. 4, 5, 6. (2) Because, the only merit of Christ, is the meritorious cause of our Conversion; <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 14. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 11. (3) Because, true Repentance, is the infallible Antecedent, and forerunner of life; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 10. <HI>Acts</HI> 11. 18. And they who truely Repent have all their sins pardoned; <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 38. <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 19. Nay, Repentance is a peice of the exercise of the life of Grace here, and worketh unto life, and salvation hereafter. But of no fore|going disposition, or qualification previous to Repentance, can these forecited places of Scripture be understood. (4) Because, Repentance, and turning to God, are some|times put, for the same thing: and the Pro|phets, while they study to excite, and stir up the people to Repentance, they signifie it, by the word <HI>Conversion</HI> and <HI>turning to GOD; Acts</HI> 11. 15, 16, 17, 18, 21. <HI>Ioel</HI> 2. 12, 13, <HI>Esek.</HI> 18. 31, 32. (5) Because, Whatsoever goes before our conversion to God, it cannot be of Faith; and therefore, it must displease God; <HI>Rom.</HI> 8: 8: <HI>Rom.</HI> 14. 23. But true Repentance is of Faith, and God delighteth in it; <HI>Ier.</HI> 31. 18, 19, 20.

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, <HI>Good works</HI> are described by the <HI>Apostle</HI> to be such, as GOD before hath ordained, that we should walk in them; <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 10.

the Apostles gave themselves continually to Prayer, and to the Ministry of the Word; <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 4.

Those <HI>Fanatick Recusants,</HI> either have the Spirit of God in them; or they want it. This last they will not grant. If then they have it, why do they refuse to perform duties of Religion, more then our blessed Saviour did, when opportunitie, and occasion, did call him. They have the Spirit but want the Impulse.

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, there is no proportion, be|tween our imperfect works. and life eternal, between the <HI>work</HI> and the <HI>Reward;</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 17. For our light afflictions worketh for us, that is brings forth, not of any <HI>Merit,</HI> but of meer Grace for Christs sake, see <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 18. <HI>Rom</HI> 3. 28. (2) If by our good Works, we deserved the pardon of sin, we might have whereof to boast; for if <HI>Abraham</HI> were justifi|ed by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God; <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 2, But the Scrip|ture saith, he that glorieth, let him glorie in the Lord: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 31. (3) Because, no creature, performing the most excellent
<PB N="121" REF="77">
Works, can deserve any favour from God, or oblige him, to give any thing as due. And according to the order of Gods justice, he can receive no favor from us; nor can any creature, confer any benefit on him; <HI>Ps.</HI> 16. 2. <HI>Iob</HI> 22. 2, 3. Truely, where there is no favour done, there can be no Merit: for merit presup|poseth a benefit accepted. (4) Because, our works are imperfect, as well, as to <HI>Parts,</HI> as to <HI>Degrees; Gal.</HI> 5. 17; <HI>Is.</HI> 64. 7. <HI>Deut.</HI> 27. 26. A <HI>Perfection of parts</HI> is, when we have a <HI>Part</HI> of every Grace, and are renewed in some measure in every power, and faculty of the whole man, though we be not come to the just and due measure in any of them. A <HI>perfection of Degrees,</HI> consists in the compleat measure of our conformity, and our exact correspondence to the Law of God, in respect of all whatsoever it requires. (5) Because, Christ says, so likewise ye, when ye shal have done all those things which are command|ed you, say we are unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do; <HI>Luke</HI> 17. 10. (6) Because, the Good Works, which we do, are not ours, but it is God that worketh in us, both to will, and to do; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 7. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 22. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 13. (7) Be|cause, that heavenly blessedness, to be given to the saints, is expresly attributed to the mercy

(8) Because, when the Apostle proclaims death to be the wages of sin, he doth not affirm life eternal to be the reward of Good Works, but the free, and gracious gift of God, which we obtain by Christ, even in our sanctification, where|of the Apostle here; <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 23. Which free Gift hath for its end, eternal life. Not that it merits this (for then it should not be a gracious gift) but because Christ, hath merited this for us, and shal of free Grace give it to us, as the following words, <HI>through Iesus Christ our Lord</HI> shew. (9) Because, God will have us to buy without money or price, <HI>Wine, Milk, Honey:</HI> that is, to receive all things requisite, and necessary for our spiritual life, for <HI>Nothing;</HI> and eternal life it self; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 55. 1, 2, 3. (10) Because, Christ should not be a perfect Saviour, if any thing from us were to be added, to the righteousness of his Merit. But Christ is a perfect Saviour; <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 7. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 7, 8, 9. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 7. <HI>Acts</HI> 4. 12. (11) Because, our best works, have such a mixture of corruption, and sin in them, that they deserve his curse, and wrath, so far are they from meriting; <HI>Isa.</HI> 64. 6. But we are all, <HI>saith the Prophet,</HI> as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses, are like
<PB N="123" REF="78">
filthy raggs.

The Gospel is so contrived, by the infinite Wisdom, and Goodness of God, that there is a judicial transferring of our sin, as a debt on Christ, the Cautioner, and a translation of his righte|ousness, and merit, to be imputed to us, for our justification, without the least respect to our works.</P>

<P>(1) Because, as a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt, rotten tree, bring forth good fruit; <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. 18.</P>
<P>(2) Because all unregenerate men are dead in Trespasses and sin; <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 1.

it is the scope, of the whole first <HI>Epistle of Iohn</HI> to propose such sure Marks to Believers, whereby they may know, that they have life eternal: 1 <HI>Iohn.</HI> 5. 13.

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the sealing of the Holy Spirit which is the <HI>Earnest</HI> of our inheritance, is gi|ven to Believers, after they have believed; <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 13, 14.

<P><HI>ARE true Believers, when they fall into some special sin which woun|deth the Conscience, and grieveth the Spirit, desti|tute of the seed of GOD, and life of Faith?</HI></P>
<P>No. 2 <HI>Iohn</HI> 3: 9: <HI>Luke</HI> 22: 32:</P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God; 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 3. 9. <HI>For his seed remain|eth in him;</HI> that is, doth not totally perish, but abideth thenceforeward; work|ing the fruits of regeneration, once begun in them; <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 6. (2) Be|cause, although <HI>Peter</HI> fell into that grievous sin of denying his Master thrice, yet he still retained, that seed of God, and life of Faith, and love to Christ; because Christ had said to him, I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not; <HI>Luke</HI> 22. 32.

<P><HI>DID GOD give to</HI> Adam <HI>a Law as a Co|venant of Works, by which he bound him and all his Posterity, to Personal, Entire, Exact, and Perpetual obedience?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Did he promise life upon the fulfilling; and did he threatten death, upon the breach of it?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Was</HI> Adam <HI>endued with Power and Ability to keep it?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Gen:</HI> 1: 26, 27: <HI>Gen:</HI> 2: 17, <HI>Rom:</HI> 2: 14, 15: <HI>Rom:</HI> 5: 12, 19: <HI>Gal:</HI> 3: 10, 12: <HI>Eccl:</HI> 7: 29: <HI>Iob</HI> 28: 28:</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Socinians <HI>err,</HI> who maintain, <HI>that God made no Covenant with</HI> Adam <HI>in his integrity, in which he promised to him, and his posterity life eternal?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) From those places of Scripture, where
<PB N="138" REF="86">
the righteousness of the Law is described; <HI>Lev.</HI> 18. 5. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 5. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 12. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 20. 11. 13. Whosoever, therefore keepeth my Statutes and Judgements, saith the Lord, shall live in them. And to whom life is promised for ever, upon their perfect obe|dience, and continuance in all things, writ|ten in the Book of the Law. And from those places, in which death is threatned to them, that in the least transgress the Law of God; <HI>Deut.</HI> 27. 26. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 10. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. 4. (2) From the words of our Saviour, who spoke to the <HI>Young man,</HI> according to the Co|venant of Works, in which the Lord pro|miseth life eternal, to such as shall fulfil the Law; <HI>Matth.</HI> 19. 17. <HI>Luke</HI> 10. 28. Observe, that Christ answereth here, according to the question, and opinion of this <HI>young man,</HI> who thought he was able to obtain salvation, by his own good works: and therefore Christ directs him to the Law, thereby to bring him to the acknowledgement, of his own imper|fection, and afterwards to Faith, in himself. (3) Because, man was created by God, in righteousness, holiness, and immortality, according to the similitude, and image of God; <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. 26. <HI>Gen.</HI> 9. 6. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7. 29. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 24. <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 9, 10. And received from him, the Law of Nature, naturally ingraven
<PB N="139" REF="86">
upon his heart; <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 14. 15. And besides this Law, a positive Law was superadded to it, that <HI>Adam</HI> should not eat of the <HI>Tree,</HI> of the <HI>Knowledge of Good,</HI> and <HI>Evil;</HI> that by obey|ing the same, he might give a <HI>Specimen,</HI> or proof of his obedience to the Law of Na|ture, in the perfect obedience whereof, so long as he should continue, he should live for e|ver. For the Lord threatned death to him only, if he should sin: and death is the wages of sin, which by sin entered into the world; <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 23. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 12. 13. (4) From those places of Scripture, in which it is denyed, that believers, under the Cove|nant of Grace, are justified by the Law; but by Faith, and the righteousness of Christ, manifested in the Gospel. For that the Law is weak, powerless, or impotent, through the corruption of our Nature, to justifie us, and give us life; <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 20, 21, 28. <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 16. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 10, 11, 12, 13. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 9. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 2, 3.</P>

<HEAD>Quest. II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DO the first four Commandments contain our duty towards GOD, and the other six, our duty towards man?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Matth.</HI> 22. 37, 38, 39, 40.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Papists, <HI>and</HI> Luthe|rians <HI>err,</HI> who maintain, <HI>that three only belong</HI>

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the two first Precepts, com|mand diverse things. The one teacheth us, who is to be worshipped, to wit, the true and living God, and no other. The second instructs us, how he is to be worshipped, namely ac|cording to his own appointment, and not according to the appointment, and pleasure of men, as by Images and such like. (2) Because, it is one, and the same <HI>Concupiscence,</HI> which is forbidden in the tenth Command, the summ whereof, <HI>Thou shalt not covet,</HI> is cited by the <HI>Apostle Paul; Rom.</HI> 7. 7. and which is summarly exprest, in the close of the tenth Command, <HI>nor any thing which is thy neighbours.</HI> (3) If the tenth Command ought to be two, be|cause these words, <HI>thou shalt not covet,</HI> are twice repeated, then would it follow, there should be as many Commands, as there are <HI>things desired, forbidden:</HI> because it is evident, that these words <HI>Thou shalt not covet,</HI> are to be re|peated with every part.</P>

<HEAD>Quest. III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ARE all the Ceremonial Laws now abrogated under the</HI> new Testa|ment?</P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 14, 16, 17. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9. 27. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2, 15, 16.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Judaisers <HI>err,</HI> who maintain, <HI>that all the Ceremonial Laws remain in their former strength, and vigour, and are oblig|ing to Believers under the Gospel, and not abroga|ted, or disanulled by Christ?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ hath abolished the Law of Commandments, contained in ordi|nances, that he might gather together, both <HI>Iews,</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> into one new man; <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 14, 15. <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 14. Note, that the Apostle here speaks of all Believers, both of <HI>Iews,</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as of one man: because, they being all under Christ the Head, as members of one spiritual Body, are made up, as one re|newed man. (2) Because, the Apostle sayes, let no man judge you, in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new Moon, or of the sabbath dayes: all which are shaddows of things to come, but the body is of Christ; <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 16, 17. This ver. is a conclusion of the Apostles foregoing discourse, against Ceremonies, and things
<PB N="142" REF="88">
commanded by the Ceremonial Law, which by the coming of Christ are abolished. He calls them in the 17 verse, a shaddow of things to come, but the body (says he) is of Christ. That is, the thing signified is of Christ: for all the shaddows of the <HI>Old Testa|ment,</HI> had respect to Christ, and his benefites, by whose coming they also have an end; <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 17. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 3, 4, 5. (3) Because, the Apostle says, Believers are dead with Christ, from the <HI>Rudiments of the World:</HI> that is, from the Ceremonial Commands; as is evident from the Context. Why says he, as though liv|ing in the World, are ye subject to ordi|nances? That is, as if your life, and happi|ness, consisted in these outward worldly principles: but suffer your selves to be bur|dened, by such Teachers, with humane in|stitutions, and ordinances. The Apostle indeed; in these last words, is reasoning a|gainst the institutions, and ordinances of men, from this <HI>Medium,</HI> which is an argu|ment from the greater, to the lesser: if ye be dead with Christ from the Ceremonies of the Law instituted in the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> by God himself, much more are ye free, from the institutions, and ordinances of men, which are only grounded upon their own good pleasure; <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 20, 21. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 10, 11.
<PB N="143" REF="88">
(4) Because, the Apostle affirms, that the Observation, and useing of Circumcision, cannot consist, with true Faith in Christ, now after the Gospel is fully published. And he exhorts the <HI>Galatians</HI> to abide in their liberty purchased by Christ, and not to sub|mit themselves, to the yoke of Mosaical Ce|remonies; <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 1, 2. (5) Because, those Teachers, who pressed the believing <HI>Gentiles</HI> to be circumcised, and to observe the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> (I mean the Ceremonial Law,) were condemned by the Council of Apostles; <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 24. (6) Because, Ceremonial Commands, are neither of the Law of Na|ture, nor are they injoyned to Believers under the Gospel as things Moral. (7) Be|cause, these appointed Ceremonies, were figures only of things to come, imposed on the <HI>Iewes,</HI> until the time of Reformati|on; but taken away by Christ; <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 9, 10, 11, 12. and <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 9. Where it is said, he taketh away the first, namely all sorts of Pro|pitiatory Offerings which were used in the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> to settle the second, namely his obedience to the will of his Father. (8) Because, they were given to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> to foresignifie, and represent Christ, and his death, and to be marks of difference be|tween them, and the unbelieving Nations;
<PB N="144" REF="89">
<HI>Col.</HI> 2. 17. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 14. Where it is said, who hath made both these, namly <HI>Iewes,</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> one: and hath broken down, the middle wall of partition, whereby the Cere|monial Law is understood, which made a difference between the <HI>Iewes,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Now, since Christ hath suffered death, and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are called, all these Ceremonies, which did foresignifie his death, and made that difference, must of necessity cease. (9) Because, the <HI>Temple of Ierusalem,</HI> to which the Ceremonies were restricted, is destroyed, and could never since be rebuild|ed.</P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="89"><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Judicial Law, was deli|vered by <HI>Moses</HI> to the <HI>Israelites</HI> to be observed, as to a <HI>Body Politick; Exod.</HI> 21 chapter.

who maintain, <HI>that Believers under the Gospel are not obliged to the obedience of the Moral Law?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ sayes, he came not to destroy the Law, and the Prophets; that is, to alter, or disannul the doctrine of the Law, or of the Prophets; <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 17. (2) Because, he says in the following verse; I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot, or one title, shal in no wise pass from the Law till all be fulfilled; <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 18.

(5) Because, all the Precepts of the Moral Law, belong to the Law of Nature, naturally in|graven, upon the hearts of men, which can|not be abrogated, but oblige all men perpe|tually, and necessarly from Natural Rea|son it self; <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 15.

<HEAD>Question I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IS GOD alone Lord of the Conscience, and hath left it free from the Doctrines, and Command|ments</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="93">
<HI>of men, which are in any thing contrary to to his Word, or beside it, in matters of Faith, or worship?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Iam.</HI> 4. 12. <HI>Acts</HI> 4. 19. <HI>Acts</HI> 5. 29. <HI>Matth.</HI> 23. 8, 9, 10. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 24. <HI>Matth.</HI> 15. 9.</P>
<P>Well then, do not the <HI>Papists</HI> err, who con|tradict this, <HI>both in doctrine (because they teach, that the</HI> Pope of Rome, <HI>and Bishops in their own Diocesses, may by their own authority,</HI> praeter Scripturam, beside the Word, <HI>make Laws, which oblige and bind the Conscience, under the pain of everlasting death) and in practise (because, they have obtruded, and do obtrude, many Eccle|siastical Rites and Ceremonies, as necessary in wor|ship, without any foundation in Scripture.)</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, there is one Law-giver, who is able to save, and to destroy; <HI>Iames</HI> 4. 12. Therefore no <HI>Pope,</HI> no <HI>Prelate,</HI> nor any meer man, can be a Law-giver. (2) Because, Christ rejects the Commandments of men, from the worship of God; <HI>Matth.</HI> 15. 9. (3) Because, the Apostles refused, to obey the orders of the Council, since they were con|trary to the Commands of God; <HI>Acts</HI> 4. 19. <HI>Acts</HI> 5. 29. (4) because, the Lord threatens to do a marvellous work among his peo|ple, because they drew near to him with their
<PB N="153" REF="93">
mouth (as the most part of the <HI>Ceremonial service,</HI> is but a drawing near to God with the mouth,) but had their hearts removed far from him; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 29. 13, 14. (5) Because, Christ expresly forbids such subjection and obedience to the Commands of men; <HI>Matth.</HI> 23. 9, 10. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 23. (6) because, the Apostles themselves forbids all will-worship, such as the <HI>Popish Ceremonies</HI> are; <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 18, 21, 22, 23. (8) Because, the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> withstood these false Brethren, unawars brought in, who came in privily, to spie out his liberty, which he had in Christ Jesus, that they might bring him into bondage, to whom he gave place by subjection, no not for an hour; that the truth of the Gospel, might continue: where he lays so much weight upon Christian liberty; that, if that were taken away, the truth of the Gospel, would perish likewise; <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 4, 5. (9) Be|cause, the Apostle commands Believers, to stand fast in their liberty, wherewith Christ hath made them free, and not to be intang|led again with the yoke of bondage; <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 1. (10) Because Ceremonies are superstiti|ous, being a vice opposite to Religion in the excess, commanding more in the Worship of God, than he requires in his Wor|ship.</P>

<HEAD>Quest. II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IS not the requiring of an implicit Faith, and an absolute, and blind obedience, to the Church, or any Man, a destroy|ing of liberty of Conscience, and Reason also?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 14. 23. <HI>Isaiah</HI> 8. 20. <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 11. <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 22. <HI>Hos.</HI> 5. 11. <HI>Rev.</HI> 13. 12, 16, 17. <HI>Ier.</HI> 8. 9.</P>
<P>Well then, do not the <HI>Papists</HI> err, who require, <HI>an</HI> Implicit Faith, <HI>to all the Decrees and Ordinances of their Church and</HI> Pope: <HI>and a blind obedience to their commands without a pre|vious judgement of discretion?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, no man performing any duty, out of blind obedience, can be perswaded in his mind, of the will of God therein: and so he that doubteth is damned, because it is not of Faith; <HI>Rom.</HI> 14. 23. (2) Because, all things must be examined, and proven by the Rule of the Word; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 8. 20. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 1, 2. (3) Because, the Apostle says, prove all things and hold fast that which is good; 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 21. (4) Because, blind obedience makes us the servants of Men, which is contrary to 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 23. And against the command of Christ, forbidding us to call any man Father on earth; <HI>Matth.</HI> 23. 9. (5) Because, abso|lute obedience, is only due to God, whose
<PB N="155" REF="94">
commands are all most just: himself being the alone Law-giver; <HI>Iames</HI> 4. 12. (6) Be|cause, every man ought to be ready to ren|der a reason of the hope which is in him; 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3. 15. This no man can do, who re|ceives the Commands of Superiors, with an <HI>Implicit Faith.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Quest. III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DO they, who upon pretence of Christian Liberty, practise any sin, or cherish any lust, destroy thereby, the end of Christian Liberty?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 13. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 2. 16. 2 <HI>Peter</HI> 2. 19. <HI>Iohn</HI> 8. 34. <HI>Luke</HI> 1. 74, 75.</P>
<P>Well then, do not the <HI>Libertines</HI> err, who maintain, <HI>that the true Christian Liberty, which we ought to follow, and use, is to take away all diffe|rence, between Good and Evil: to esteem nothing of sin; nor to be touched with any Conscience, or sense of it: that every man ought to follow the swing of his own lust?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Do not likewise the</HI> Antinomians <HI>err,</HI> who maintain, <HI>almost the same very Tenet, and opini|on?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, we being called to liberty, ought not to use our liberty, for an occasion
<PB N="156" REF="95">
of the flesh; <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 13: And that with well doing, we ought to put to silence, the igno|rance of foolish men; 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 2: 15: (2) Be|cause, they that follow, the liberty of sin|ning, and promise liberty to others, are truely the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage: 2 <HI>Peter</HI> 2: 19. (3) Because, the end of that liberty, which is purchased by Christ, is that, being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve him without fear, in holiness, and righteousness, all the days of our life; <HI>Luke</HI> 1 74, 75: (4) Be|cause, whosoever committeth sin, is the ser|vant of sin; <HI>Iohn</HI> 8: 34: (5) Because, the Moral Law obligeth Believers to perform obedience, out of gratitude, and thankful|ness: for Christ came not to destroy the Law but to fulfil it; <HI>Matth:</HI> 5: 17: (6) Because, whosoever shall break one of these least com|mandments, and shall teach men so, he shal be called the least in the kingdom of Heaven; <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 19:</P>

<P>Yes. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5, 1, 5, 11. 13, 2 <HI>Iohn</HI> v: 10, 11: 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6: 3, 4: <HI>Titus</HI> 1: 10, 11, 13: <HI>Titus</HI> 3: 10. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1: 19, 20: <HI>Matth:</HI> 18: 15, 16, 17: Rev: 2: 2, 14, 15, 20: <HI>Rev:</HI> 3: 9:</P>

<P>Yes:</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="96"><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, are for this end delivered to the Ministers of the Church, that with Censures, they may pursue Scandalous, and offending Persons, who will not obey admonition; <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 15, 17, 18. But such also are Hereticks; <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 20. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 10. 12. (2) Because an Heretick after the first and second admoni|tion, is to be rejected, avoided, or shuned. That is, let him not remain in the external Communion, of the Church; <HI>Titus</HI> 3. 10. (3) Because, <HI>Paul</HI> did excommunicat <HI>Hyme|neus,</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> who had made ship|wrack of the Faith; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 19, 20. (4) Be|cause, if any man obey not our Word, by this Epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be asham|ed; 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3. 14. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6. 4, 5. <HI>Titus</HI> 1. 11: (5) Because, Christ approves, and commends the Pastors of the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> because they could not suffer them, that are evil, but had tried them, which say they are A|postles, and were not, and had found them Liars; <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 2. And Christ in that same chapter, accuses the Pastors of the Church of <HI>Pergamus,</HI> and <HI>Thyatira,</HI> and threatneth them, because they had suffered Hereticks to be in the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="96"><HI>The</HI> Lutherians, Anabaptists, Arminians, <HI>and other</HI> Sectaries <HI>are confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, it is evident, from many examples of Godly Magistrats, who did extirpat Idolatry, and inflict punishment up|on Idolaters, as did <HI>Iacob</HI> the <HI>Patriarch,</HI> who at least purged his family of strange Gods; <HI>Gen.</HI> 35. 2, 3, 4. <HI>Moses</HI> likewise took pu|nishment with the sword, upon those, who did worship the <HI>Golden-Calf; Exod.</HI> 32. 26, 27, 28. We have (2) the examples of <HI>He|sekia;</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 18. 4. Of <HI>Iosia;</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 23. Of <HI>Asa,</HI> who decreed that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of <HI>Israel</HI> (according to the law of God; <HI>Deut.</HI> 13. 9.) should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man, or woman; 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 15. 13. Of <HI>Iehosa|phat;</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 17. 6. Of <HI>Nehemia</HI> 13. 15, 17. (3) Were not good kings reproved, and was it not imputed to them, as a fault, that they did not take away the High-places? 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 12. 3. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 14. 4. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 15. 4. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15. 17. Far more is it a fault to suffer Here|ticks. (4) It is evident from the office of the Magistrat, who is the Minister of God against them, that do evil, and beareth not the sword in vain: <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 3, 4. (5) Because, it is expresly commanded in Scripture, that punishment be inflicted upon Idolaters, even
<PB N="160" REF="97">
by the nearest Relations. If then, the Fa|ther may kill the Son, may kill the Daughter, the Husband the Wife of his bosom: and if one brother may stone another brother with stones, that he die, for being Idolaters; much more may the Civil Magistrat do this; <HI>Deut.</HI> 13. 6. to the 13 verse; <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. 2. to the 7 verse; <HI>Lev.</HI> 24. 16. (6) Because, it is foretold, that under the New <HI>Testament,</HI> Kings shall be nursing Fathers to the Church, and Queens nursing Mothers, and that Hereticks, that were about to be hurtful, to the Church, shall be removed, and taken away; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 49. 23. <HI>Zech.</HI> 13. 2, 3. And it shall come to pass, in that day saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the Idols, out of the land (that is, all Idolatry whatsoever, so that the same shall not be so much as named, any more among you) and they shall no more be remembred. And I will also cause the Prophets, (the false Prophets) and the unclean Spirit, to pass out of the Land: that is, the false Teachers who teach impure doc|trines, through the inspiration of the unclean Spirit the Devil. Compare with this 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 1, 2, 3. For confirmation, consider what is foretold by <HI>Iohn; Rev.</HI> 17. 12, 16, 17. That the Kings of the Earth, shall eat the flesh of the Whore, and burn her with fire. All
<PB N="161" REF="97">
which are foretold, as blessings to be confer|ed upon the Church. (7) It is evident from the Epithets, whereby the pernicious, and destructive nature of Hereticks, is set forth in Scripture. They are called Wolfes, not sparing the flock, Thieves, Robers, Troublers of the Church, and Seducers, or Beguilers of poor souls. They are like unto a Gangren, or Canker in the body. They are as leaven, or soure dough, which leaveneth the whole lump; <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 29. <HI>Iohn</HI> 10. 8. <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 24. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 12. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 17. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 9. (8) Be|cause, <HI>Ezra</HI> did esteem it, a great favour and blessing of God, conferred upon the Church; for which he thanked God, that had in|clined the heart of <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> to publish a Decree, for the punishment of those, that did not observe the Law, whether it be, (saith the Text) unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to impris|onment; <HI>Chap.</HI> 7. 23, 25, 28. (9) Because, we ought to pray for Kings, and all in Au|thority, that under them, we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all Godliness, and in Honesty, which end cannot be attained, unless the Civil Magistrat bridle and ty up Hereticks; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 12. These words, <HI>in all Godliness,</HI> concerns Religion. or the first Table of the Moral Law, as the following
<PB N="162" REF="98">
word <HI>honesty,</HI> or <HI>civility,</HI> hath a respect to the commands of the second Table, and the duties which we owe to our neighbour, and to one another. For true Magistrates, are keepers and defenders of both Tables of the ten Commandments. (10) Because, the tolera|tion of Hereticks, as we may read of the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> in <HI>Germany, Thomas Muntzer, Iohn</HI> of <HI>Leidden,</HI> and their followers, first by rail|ling against the Ministry, as the <HI>Quakers</HI> do, and raging against Magistracy, brought both Church and State into confusion, put the country into burning flames, wherein them|selves at length were consumed to Ashes.</P>

<P>Do not thirdly, <HI>some</HI> Bee-headed Men <HI>err, who dispute against the Beeing of a God-head, because they cannot find a Demonstration for it called</HI> Dihoti?</P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood, by the things which are made, even his eternal power, and God|head: so that they are without excuse; <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 20. (2) Because, the <HI>Psalmist</HI> saith, the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy work. That is, they give us matter and occasion to speak and discourse of his Omnipotency, Wisdom, and Goodness; <HI>Psalm</HI> 19: 1, 2, 3. (3) Because, the knowledge of the Law of Nature, is na|turally implanted in the minds of all men; <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 14. Therefore, some knowledge of
<PB N="164" REF="99">
the law-giver, must be implanted in the minds of all men. (4) Because, in the most wick ed, and ungodly there are terrors and tortures of conscience, wherewith, nil they, will they, they are haunted and possessed: whence it is evident, that in the minds of all men, there is some lively knowledge of God. (5) Be|cause, men had rather worship a stock, or a stone, than they should think, there were no God; <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 23. (6) What a brave order, and comliness, shines forth, with so much wisdom, and power, in the government and preservation of things above and below; that no man can be in doubt, but there must be a God, who rules and preserves all those things. (7) Because, nothing can be the cause of it self: because then, it should be both the Cause, and the Effect, both before and after it self: therefore all things have their beginning, from one first and supream Cause, which is God. (8) Because, the ex|istence of a God-head, may be evinced from the foretelling of things to come; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 41. 23. And as <HI>Cicero</HI> says, <HI>si est divinatio, sunt Dii,</HI> if there be a foretelling, there must be also a God that foretelleth. (9) From the assaults, and suggestions of Satan, we find there is a devil, may we not then certainly conclude that there is a God? The Devil
<PB N="165" REF="99">
labours by all means to extinguish the light of the Gospel, to lead men on in ignorance, error, and prophanness, and to turn them out of the path of holiness. Now, why should Satan thus warr against God, his word, and his Saints? Why should he seek Gods dishonour, and mans destruction, if there were not a God, a Law, and an everlasting life? (10) Because, the mind of man is not satisfied with the knowledge of all things; nor the will of man, with the enjoyment of all things in this world, but still they seek and thirst earnestly, after some higher good. There is therefore, a soveraign&punc; Truth, and Chief Good, which being perfectly known, and enjoyed, will give contentment, and satisfaction, to the Soul. In vain should the Powers, and Faculties of the Soul, be capable of happiness, or of the Chief Good; if there were not a Chief Good to be possessed, and enjoyed. (11) From the wonders, and mi|racles, which have been wrought, visible, and apparent works, extraordinarly wrought, not only above the ordinary course of Na|ture, but simply above the power of Nature. These effects do convince, that there is an infinite power, which is above, and over|ruleth all things. For every principal, and primary cause, is more excellent, than the
<PB N="166" REF="100">
effects thereof. (12) From the beeing of man, the curious workmanship of his body in the womb, which is wrought most artificially; namely with sinews, veins, arteries, muscels&punc; and other parts of the body, even as an Em|broiderer sitteth, and joyneth many parcels&punc; stuff, and dyed work of various colours, very artificially, and curiously together, un|till there cometh forth some goodly Pour|traiture, or other dainty workmanship; <HI>Psal.</HI> 139. 15. <HI>Iob</HI> 10. 10. But especially from the beeing of a mans soul, which is immaterial, invisible, rational, immortal, and which cannot be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> traduce,</HI> from the power of the matter (as the sensitive souls of Bruits) nei|ther doth depend on the body in many of its operations. These, and all the works, which our eye doth see, or the mind doth apprehend do prove, that there is a God, who hath gi|ven a Beeing to them, and continueth them therein. (13) Because, seeing God is the the first cause, there cannot be any thing <HI>Prior</HI> to him, by which, as a cause, his exist|ence can be Demonstrated.</P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, it is expresly against the se|cond command; <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. 4, 5. (2) Be|cause, God is infinite, unmeasurable, in|comprehensible, and spiritual: and therefore nothing can represent him, as the Prophet well infers; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 40. 18, 25. (3) Because, every representation of God, by graven images, or pictures, is a most disgraceful changing of the glory of the incorruptible God; <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 23. (4) Because, images, and pictures of this kind, are lies and vanities, which the
<PB N="168" REF="101">
Lord abhores, and mocks at with an holy scorn; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 44. from verse 9. to 18. (5) Because, the Lord expresly forbiddeth the <HI>Israelites</HI> to represent him under any form or shape, for (saith the Text) ye saw no man|ner of similitude, on the day that the Lord spake to you in <HI>Horeb,</HI> out of the midst of the fire; <HI>Deut.</HI> 4. 15. to verse 20.

<P><HI>IS Religious worship to be given to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and to him alone?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Is Religious worship, to be given to Angels, Saints, or any other Creature?</HI></P>
<P>No. <HI>Matth,</HI> 4. 10. <HI>Iohn</HI> 8. 49. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 14. <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. 23. <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 18. <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. 10. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 25.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Papists <HI>err,</HI> who maintain, <HI>that not only God, but good Angels, and Saints departed, being Canonized by the</HI> Pope, <HI>ought to be worshipped, and called upon, even after a religious manner: but cheifly the</HI> Virgin Mary, <HI>and that there is a Divine Power in the Relicks of Saints, which therefore ought to be worship|ped?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Lord our God, and he only is to be worshipped; <HI>Matth.</HI> 4. 10. <HI>Deut</HI> 6. 13. (2) Because, the Object of invocati|on, and religious Adoration, is he only who is Omnipotent, Omniscient, and searcher of the heart. For there is none that knows our necessities and wants, but he that is Omnis|cient: and none can succour and help us, but he that is Omnipotent. But Angels are not Omniscient; <HI>Eph.</HI> 3. 10. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 1. 12. Nei|ther
<PB N="170" REF="102">
are the Saints departed Omniscient, as is clear from <HI>Isa.</HI> 63. 16. <HI>Abraham</HI> is ignorant of us. (3) Because, they that are dead, know nothing of our condition; <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9. 5. (4) Because, no man ought to call upon him, in whom he doth not believe; <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 14. But no man ought to believe in Saints, or Angels, but in God alone; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 26. 4. <HI>Ier.</HI> 17. 5. (5) Because, neither Saints alive, nor Angels would suffer adoration, and worship to be given to themselves; <HI>Acts</HI> 10. 25. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 8, 9. (6) Because, the worshipping of Angels doth derogate from the honour of Christ, in whom we have boldness, and ac|cess with confidence by the faith of him, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3. 12. (7) Because, the worshipping of Saints and Angels, is like a <HI>Polytheismus,</HI> the having of many Gods. For the <HI>Papists</HI> attribute to each one of their Saints, and An|gels, a proper divine power, as the <HI>Heathens</HI> did of old, to their Idols, and false gods.</P>

<P><HI>IS any Religious worship given to God, since the fall, without a Me|diator?</HI></P>
<P>No.</P>
<P><HI>Nor in the mediation of any other, but of Christ alone?</HI></P>
<P>No. <HI>Iohn</HI> 14. 6. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 5. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 18. <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 17.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="102">Well then, <HI>doth not the</HI> Popish Church <HI>err,</HI> who maintain, <HI>that Saints departed, but chiefly the</HI> Virgin Mary <HI>are Mediators and Intercessors between God and Man?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Scripture affirms expres|ly, that there is but one Mediator between God and Man, namely the Man Jesus Christ; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 5. (2) Because, no man cometh to the Father, but by Christ; <HI>Iohn</HI> 14. 6. And by him, we have access to the Father; <HI>Eph:</HI> 2. 18. (3) Because, the Scripture pro|miseth that they shall be heard, that in the name of Christ, seek such things, as are ac|cording to the will of God: but there is no promise in all the Word, that they shall be heard that pray to Saints or Angels; <HI>Iohn</HI> 14. 13, 14. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. 14. (4) Because, the A|postle says, whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, not in the name of Saints; <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 17. (5) Because, Christ who is called the propitiation for our sins, is also called our Advocate with the Father; 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 2. 1, 2.

<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Adamites, <HI>and others long since err,</HI> who denyed, <HI>that God was to be called upon. For (say they) God is Omniscient, and bestowes all things upon us freely without our prayers?</HI></P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, there are extant many uni|versal precepts in the Word, by which the duty of prayer is commanded; <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. 6. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 17. <HI>Iohn</HI> 16. 24. <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. 7.

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Apostle teaches expresly the contrary; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 9, 12. (2) Be|cause, prayers celebrated in an unknown

<P>(1) Because, the Dead are either happy; and so they need not our prayers; <HI>Rev.</HI> 14. 13.

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ commanded his A|postles, and in them, all the Ministers of the Gospel, to whom he hath promised his pre|sence, to the end of the World, to teach all Nations, and to preach the Gospel to every creature; <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19. <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 15. (2) Because, the publick preaching of the Word, by a Minister sent, and called, and the hear|ing of it, is a mean ordained, and appointed by God, and according to the ordinary manner, necessary for begetting Faith; and therefore needful to salvation; <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 14, 15. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 21. (3) Because, God hath promised to his Covenanted ones, to bring them to his holy mountain, and make them joyful in his house of prayer; that is, in the publick meetings of his Saints, and People; <HI>Isaiah.</HI> 56. 7. (4) From the example of those Believers; <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 42. who continued steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine. (5) Be|cause,
<PB N="177" REF="105">
the word of God, is the perfect Rule of life and manners. And all Spirits, are to be tried by it; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 15. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 1. <HI>Isaiah</HI> 8. 20. Neither ought we to follow, or hear any man, no not an Angel if he teach any thing contrary to the Word, or Heterodox from it; 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2. 2. <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 8. (6) Because, the Word of God, is that in|corruptible seed, by which we are born again; 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 1. 23. (7) Because, God forbids ex|presly separations from publick assemblies (I mean so long as the Word is truely and purely taught, by those who enter in by the right door, that is Christ, and the way ap|pointed by him in his Word; <HI>Iohn</HI> 10. 7, 8.) <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 25.

<P><HI>For confutation of the</HI> Quakers, <HI>two things must be made out: the one that the office of the Mini|stry, is of divine institution.</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, God hath particularly de|signed some persons to the work of the Mini|stry. For if God appointed some persons to be judges over <HI>Israel,</HI> then must the office of judgeing <HI>Israel</HI> be of divine institution. Christ
<PB N="178" REF="106">
appointed not only Apostles, the seventy Disciples, Evangelists, Prophets, whose call and gifts were extraordinary, but other or|dinary Pastors, and Teachers, whose Spirits were not infallible, whom the Scripture affirms to be as truely by Divine institution&punc; as the former; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 28. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 11. (2) Because, GOD hath given peculiar names and titles, to the persons designed for this of|fice, which he hath not given to other Saints. The onely wise GOD will not distinguish&punc; where he himself hath made no distinction&punc; or difference. These are called Pastors, Teachers, such as rule well, Stewards of the Mysteries of GOD, Preachers, Bishops or Overseers of the Flock, Stars in Christs right hand, Angels of the Churches. Christ evi|dently puts a difference between the Church|es and the Angels, set over them; <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 1, 8, 12, 18. <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 17, 14. (3) Because, the Lord hath taken a special care to bestow pe|culiar gifts and qualifications upon these per|sons, so designed for the Ministery; and that for the good of the Souls of his People, a|bove what is required in other Saints. Would ever the Lord have bestowed such qualifica|tions, if he had not appointed some for such an Office? Though gifts as gifts do not alone invest into such an office, yet when they are strictly required, they argue, that there is an
<PB N="179" REF="106">
Office. They must be apt to teach others; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 2. And not onely so, but able to teach o|thers; able to convince them that oppose themselves; <HI>Titus</HI> 1. 9. They must be such as study to shew themselves approven unto GOD; workmen that need not be asham|ed; 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 15. And the Apostle in admi|ration of the difficulty of this employment, cryeth out, <HI>Who is sufficient for these things?</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 16. (4) Because, the Lord requires peculiar duties of his Ministers, which he doth not require of Believers; therefore, there must be such a distinct office, by divine institution. They must take special care of the Church of GOD; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 5. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 2. 3. They are not to neglect the gift which is in them; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 14. They are to medi|tate on these things, and to give themselves wholly to them; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 15. <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 2. 4. They are to preach the Word, to rebuke, to instruct gainsayers; 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 2. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 25. To administer the Sacraments; <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 13. To ordain others for the Mi|nistry, by imposition of hands; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 14. To watch over the flock, as those that must give an account; <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 17. (5) Because, Christ requires peculiar distinct duties in the people, in reference to their Ministers; there|fore the office of the Ministry must be of di|vine
<PB N="180" REF="107">
institution. They must know and ac|knowledge those that are over them in the Lord; 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 12. Highly to esteem them in love for their works sake; 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 13. To obey them, to encourage them; <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 7. To maintain them; <HI>Gal.</HI> 6. 6. To pray for them; 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3. 1. (6) Because, GOD hath made peculiar promises to his Ministers; as, <HI>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world; Matth.</HI> 28. 20. The promise of special assistance; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 5. 6. Of protection and defence in all aslaults; <HI>Rev.</HI> 1. 20. The pro|mise of the power of the keyes, which pro|mise was not limited to the Apostles, as A|postles, but was given to the Apostles, as Ministers of the Gospel, as is evident from <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. 17, 18. The promise of special sympa|thy with them; <HI>Matth.</HI> 10. 40. <HI>Luke</HI> 10. 16. <HI>Iohn</HI> 13. 20. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4. 8. Now, would ever the Lord have promised to keep up, and main|tain that office in his Church which he had not set up and instituted.</P>
<P><HI>The other thing to be made out, is that the office of the Ministry, is perpetually necessary?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the ordinances are perpe|tually necessary, by divine institution: there|fore the office of the Ministry, to dispense these ordinances, is perpetually necessary, by divine institution. For if God had only ap|pointed
<PB N="181" REF="107">
the ordinances, to continue in his Church, then would preaching, and admini|stration of the Sacraments fail: because, that which is every mans work, is usually and effectually no mans work. The Lord doth not immediatly administer them himself: neither are Angels employed for this work. But he hath committed this service to men, who are Stewards, and dispensers of the my|steries of God. It is evident that the preach|ing of the Word, shall continue to the end of the world, from <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 20. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4 11, 12, 13. It is evident of Baptism, and the Lords Supper, which are conjoyned in the institution of Christ, with the Ministery of the Word. For to whom, he gave com|mission to preach, to them also he gave com|mission to administer the Sacraments. Bap|tism is an ordinance of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> ap|pointed by God himself. For <HI>Iohn</HI> was sent to baptize. God was the Author, <HI>Iohn</HI> was only the Minister. This was to continue perpetually, as is evident from Christs pro|mise, and his precept; <HI>Matth.</HI> 28, 20. The ends for which Baptism was ordained, are not temporary, but moral, and so perpetu|al. Do not all Christians, now need these means as the Christians during the age of the Apostles? Are not Christians to be baptized into his death, buried with him by
<PB N="182" REF="108">
Baptism, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. It is called by the holy Ghost, a saving Ordi|nance, and is unto believers, and their seed in the New Testament, as the <HI>Ark</HI> was to <HI>Noah,</HI> and his family in the <HI>old World,</HI> who be|ing in the <HI>Ark,</HI> was saved from perishing in the waters, when the rest were drowned: so Baptism doth now save us, not only or mainly, the outward part of it, the putting away the filth of the flesh, (which is yet an Ordinance to further our salvation) but when the Spirit of Regeneration effectually concurs, so that we find there is a renewing of the holy Ghost, and thereby the <HI>answer of a good conscience towards God;</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 21. It is evident, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is to continue to the end of the world. It was not only appointed for Apostles, to whom it was first administred, but unto all believers, both <HI>Iews,</HI> and Gentiles. And not only for that age, but for all generations succeeding, for Believers, are commanded, to shew forth the Lords death till he come, by eating this bread, and drinking this cup. Therefore, if these ordinances, be appointed by God, to continue to the end, it follows evi|dently, that he hath designed the office of
<PB N="183" REF="108">
the Ministry to hold up, and hold forth his Ordinances to the end of the world. (2) Be|cause, the promises, which Christ hath made to uphold the Ministry, are perpetual; there|fore the office must be perpetual; <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 20. Go teach, and baptize all Nations, and <HI>lo I am with you to the end of the world.</HI> This promise cannot be limited to the particular age, during the lives of the Apostles; because the Holy Ghost, useth three expressions, to declare the perpetuity of this promise, <HI>Aion,</HI> that this promise, shall continue so long as the world continues. Secondly, <HI>Synteleia; Heos tes synteleias tu Aionos,</HI> that this promise shall have no end, till the world be consum|mat, or brought to a Period. Thirdly, <HI>Pasas tas Hemeras,</HI> all days, and successions of times. Not only <HI>Meth hymon hemeras hy|mon,</HI> not only with you, during your own dayes, but all the dayes of the Gospel, till time shall be no more, And this promise was made not to the Apostles, as Apostles, nor to the Apostles as Believers, but to the Apostles, as ministers and Stewards, of the Mysteries of God. (3) Because, the Elect require, the office of the Ministry perpetually. Our Natures are as bad, as <HI>Iews,</HI> and <HI>Pagans; Eph.</HI> 2: 3. Our judgements full of darkness, and ignorance; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 14. Our wills
<PB N="184" REF="109">
stuborn and rebellious, and so alienated, that we rebel against the light. The delu|sions of Satan are strong. The multitude of false Teachers are very numerous, so that they are ready to seduce the Elect themselves, if it were possible. (4) Because, the ends for which Christ, hath appointed a ministry are perpetually necessary. The Elect must be called and gathered, for there will be some still in every age, to be added to the Church, of them that shall be saved. There are many sheep, which are not yet brought into his fold: many who belong to the Election, who are not yet effectually called, them also will Christ bring in, both <HI>Iews,</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that there may be one fold, as there is one shep|hers. Now, God hath revealed no other ordinary way to convert, and bring these in|to his fold, but the Ministry of his word; for how shall they believe without a Preacher? Therefore, if there be some Elect, continual|ly to be brought into fellowship with Christ, and this end not fully attained, till the end of the World, then the Ministry assigned to this end, must be perpetually necessary.</P>

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) From the practise of Christ, and his Apostles; <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 30. From the example of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas; Acts</HI> 16. 25. From <HI>Moses,</HI> and the <HI>Israelites; Exod.</HI> 15. (2) Because, the singing of <HI>Psalms</HI> was commanded under the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> and that, not as a Type of any substance to come, nor for any cere|monial cause. Neither is it abrogated under the <HI>New Testament,</HI> but confirmed; <HI>Psalm</HI> 30. 4. <HI>Psalm</HI> 149. 1. (3) From the general and universal commands in the <HI>New Testament; Eph.</HI> 5. 19. <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 16. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 15. (4) Be|cause, the Apostle <HI>Iames</HI> says, is any man afflicted, let him pray, is any man merry, let him sing <HI>Psalms; Chap.</HI> 5. 13. The meaning is not, that none should sing, but such as are merry: for then none should pray but such as are afflicted. (5) Because, by singing of <HI>Psalms,</HI> we glorifie God, we make his praise glorious. We edify others with whom we sing, as well, as we edify our selves. So the end to be proposed in singing, is teaching and admonishing one another, in
<PB N="186" REF="110">
<HI>Psalms,</HI> and <HI>Hymns,</HI> and spiritual songs; <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 16. Lastly, we chear and refresh our selves, by making melody in our hearts to the Lord; <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 19. Which ariseth first from our consciencious going about it, as a piece of worship to God, and in so doing we are accepted in that. Secondly from its be|ing a part of Scripture, appointed for his praise, whether it agree with our case or not. That being the end wherefore it was designed to be sung, is a sufficient warrand for our joyning in the singing thereof.</P>

<HEAD>Quest. XI.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HAth GOD in his Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual Commandment, binding all men in all ages, parti|cularly appointed, one day in seven, for a Sabbath to be kept holy unto himself?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. 8, 10, 11. <HI>Isaiah</HI> 56. 2, 4, 6, 7.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not some men err,</HI> who main|tain,
<PB N="188" REF="111">
<HI>that God hath not under the Gospel determi|ned any certain day, for his own worship, but on|ly hath commanded, that some</HI> indefinite time, <HI>be destined for publick worship, which time (say they) is left to be determined, by the Church?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the determining of an ordi|nary and sufficient time, for divine worship, and as a Sabbath, belongs to God only, and not to man. For we do not read, that any such power or authority, is granted to man, either by the Law of Nature, or Scripture. Is it not a thing of very great moment? Is it likely, that the wisdom of God, would leave it uncertain? This might accuse the Scripture of imperfection. It is not sutable to the love of God, and his care towards his Church. By such mens doctrine, the Church Universal, and all Oecumenick Councils, should be guilty of a dreadful sin, which for so many ages, have been deficient in their duty. Therefore, it behoveth that there be one day of seven by virtue of the fourth Command, seeing no where els another ne|cessary day, is appointed, or prescribed in the Word. (2) Because, it is just and equi|table (as the adversaries grant) that one day should be set apart for GOD, who hath
<PB N="189" REF="111">
freely given us six. (3) Because, in six dayes, God made the Heavens, and the Earth, and rested on the seventh: not out of necessity, but to give us an example, to do the like. (4) Because, one day of ten, twenty, or thirty, cannot be thought conve|nient. Neither is such a thing commanded, in any place of Scripture. And would it not argue a neglect of divine worship, &amp; the care of souls, if one day of twenty, thirty, or fourty were appointed? Neither, can the fifth, fourth, or sixth day be appointed, see|ing God hath commanded us to work six dayes. This would make our yoke more heavy than the <HI>Iewish</HI> yoke, which the Ad|versaries will not grant. (5) Because, it is the principal, and chief scope of the fourth Command, that one day of seven, in respect of us, be set apart, and consecrated to divine worship. Not truely that some <HI>indefinite time,</HI> be set apart. If this were true, the fourth Command, should differ substantially, from the other Precepts of the Decalogue; and so there behoved to be an useless Precept, or at least a Tautology ought to be commit|ted.</P>
<P><HI>Do not likewise the</HI> Anabaptists, Socinians, <HI>and</HI> Libertins <HI>err, with whom we may take in the</HI> Quakers, (<HI>and other</HI> Antisabbatarians, that

disown <HI>the Sabbath, as being carnal, and a Com|mand of the Letter) who teach, that whatever is contained in the fourth Command, is Ceremonial, and so properly, as to the matter, and substance, which it holds out, abrogated wholly. And there|fore (say they) by virtue of this fourth Command there is no day to be set a part, for publick divine worship?</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the fourth Command, which appoints one day of seven to be set apart for God, is a positive, and moral Command, as to substance; seeing it was given to <HI>Adam</HI> in his integrity, before ever there was need of any Types, and Ceremonies shaddowing forth Christ; <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 2, 3. (2) Because, it was repeated, before the promulgation of the Ceremonial Law; <HI>Exod.</HI> 16. 23. Thirdly, because it was written, with Gods own hand, and inserted into the midst of the rest of the moral precepts, and was put into the <HI>Ark</HI> of the <HI>Testimony,</HI> with the other nine, which ho|nour, was never conferred upon any precept meerly Ceremonial. (4) Because, all the reasons of this Command, are intirely Moral. He rested after six days, and allowed us six days to work, therefore in all equity we ought to rest after so many days work, and give God a seventh. (5) Because, Christ
<PB N="191" REF="112">
confirms this Command, in saying, pray that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day, where the Lord insinuat|eth that as travelling is troublesome to the bo|dy in winter, so would it be to the minds of the Godly to travel on that day, specially and solemnly set apart for Gods worship. Now, if there were no sabbath to continue after Christs ascension, or if it were not to be san|ctified, there would be no occasion of this grief and trouble, that they behoved to tra|vel on the Sabbath, and durst not tary till that day were by-past; and so no cause to put up this prayer which yet by our Lords exhortation seemeth to infer that the Sabbath was to be as certain in its time, as the Winter. And doubtless this cannot be meaned of the <HI>Iewish</HI> Sabbath; for that was to be abolished shortly. Next, travelling on the <HI>Iewish</HI> Sabbath was to be no cause of grief unto them, if indeed all days were a|like, neither would it be scroupled in such a case by the Apostles to whom he is now speaking.</P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Do not others likewise err,</HI> who maintain, <HI>that the observation of the Lords Day, is only of Ecclesiastick and Apostolick institution?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P>These Authors, (you see) do con|found, and make two things really distinct, to be but one, namely Ecclesiastick and A|postolick institution?</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the fourth Command standing, wherein one day of seven is appointed, the numbering is left free to God himself, that the right, and power may be reserved to Christ the Law-giver, and to his Spirit, for the change of the day, and continuing the wor|ship, prescribed in the fourth Command. (2) From the name it self; for our Sabbath is called the <HI>Lords Day, Rev.</HI> 1. 10. I was in the Spirit on the <HI>Lords Day:</HI> or on <HI>that Lords</HI>
<PB N="193" REF="113">
<HI>Day,</HI> or <HI>Dominick Day,</HI> or day which is the Lords; pointing out a day singularly, and a day, which in a particular, &amp; special manner is cal|led <HI>His</HI> day; even as the Lords prayer and the Lords Supper are so called, because appointed by Christ the Lord. (3) Because, God only can abrogate the Lords day (the Adversa|ries granting so much) therefore, he that hath power to rescind hath power likewise to esta|blish. (4) Because, there is an implicit Com|mand, concerning the observation of the Lords day; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16. 2. As I have (saith <HI>Paul</HI>) given order to the churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI> even so do ye the first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him. From which place, we reason thus; that not the seventh, but the first day, is the chief solemn day for worship after Christs Resurrection, because, the Apostles did pitch particularly and eminently upon that day, and that in diverse Churches, as the fittest time, for expressing their Charity. He doth not think it indifferent, what day it be done on, nor that all dayes are alike, but pitcheth on the first day, not in one Church only, but in many. Next, this command, supposeth them to be already ac|quainted with some special priviledges of the first day beyond others; and that there must be some peculiar thing in this day making
<PB N="194" REF="114">
it fit, yea more fit for such a purpose, rather than any other day. (5) Because, as the seventh day, was instituted, in remembrance of the works of Creation, so the first day, after the work of redemption was finished, succeeded as most convenient, for collating, and comparing both Mercies together. (6) Because, Christ on the first day of the week, appeared most frequently to his Disciples, and blessed it with his presence; <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 9. <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 3. <HI>Iohn</HI> 20. 19, 26. (7) Because, on that day, the holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles. And on the same day <HI>Peter</HI> baptized three thousand; <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 41. (8) Because, the Church, in the time of the Apostles did observe the first day of the week, as holy; <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 7. But the pra|ctise of the Apostles, approven in Scripture, is equivalent to a Divine Institution. (9) Because, Christ was seen of his Apostles fourty dayes after his Resurrection, and spoke to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, during which time he hath taught them all things needful to be known, and among the rest (it is probable) the change of the Sabbath, and the institution of the first day of the week, and that imme|diatly after his resurrection: he hath either immediatly by himself institute that day, or
<PB N="195" REF="114">
hath inspired his Apostles to observe it, from that same very time. (10) Because, the Lord hath remarkably owned this Christian Sabbath, in being remarkably avenged, up|on the breakers, and profanners thereof, as it is clear from several Histories.</P>

<P>Yes. <HI>Exod.</HI> 16. 23, 25, 26, 29, 30. <HI>Exod.</HI> 31. 15, 16, 17. <HI>Isa.</HI> 58. 13. <HI>Neh.</HI> 13. 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22.</P>

<P>Yes.</P>

<P>(1) From <HI>Isaiah</HI> 65. 16. where it is pro|mised, under the time of the Gospel, that the Nations to be converted to Christ, shall swear by the name of God, as is clear also from <HI>Ierem.</HI> 4. 2. (2) Because, the calling upon the name of God with due fear and reverence in swearing, is commanded in the third Command, as the profanation of his name is forbidden: but Christ came not to abolish the moral Law. (3) From the ap|proven
<PB N="199" REF="116">
examples of the Saints, which occurr in the New Testament; <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 20. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 9. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 13, 18. <HI>Rev.</HI> 10. 6. (4) Be|cause, the end of an Oath, is approven by God, and is in all ages, necessary to all men, being the end of all controversie; <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 16. (5) Because, an oath rightly taken, is an Act of Religion, whereby we glorifie God, and adore his attributes. We thereby, first, solemnly acknowledge his <HI>Beeing</HI> and <HI>Existence.</HI> Secondly, his <HI>Ubiquity</HI> that he is present in all places, and at all times, and within our hearing; <HI>Psalm</HI> 139. 7. His <HI>Omniscience,</HI> that he is the searcher of the heart. The Apostle calls him <HI>Kardiognostes;</HI> Acts 15. 8. We ac|knowledge, fourthly, his <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Veracity:</HI> he is a witness brought into the Court, that cannot lie, nor be impos'd upon, as saith the Apostle, <HI>be not deceived God is not mocked; Gal.</HI> 6. 7.

Seventhly, we acknowledge his <HI>Providence,</HI> and Fatherly care of the concerns of mankind, owning the cause of the Righ|teous.</P>
<P>(6) Because, there being an express law for swearing (to wit rightly; <HI>Deut.</HI> 10 20.)
<PB N="200" REF="117">
it must either belong to the Moral Law, to the Judicial Law, or Ceremonial Law. The Adversaries will not call it, a part of the Judicial Law, which was given to the <HI>Iewes,</HI> as a Body Politick, which expired together with the state of that People. It is no part of the Ceremonial Law: for what was purely Ceremonial, was purely Typical: but the Law concerning an oath was not a Type of any thing to come. And if it was a Type, where will you find its Antitype in all the Gospel, or the thing represented by it? There|fore, it must be a part of the Moral Law; <HI>Deut.</HI> 6. 13. <HI>Ier.</HI> 4. 2, and consequently per|petual, which Christ came not to destroy. It is confirmed hence, that it was of Authen|tick use, and held sacred among the Patri|archs, before the delivery of the Levitical Law, as it is clear from <HI>Abraham</HI> the father of the faithful, and <HI>Abimelech; Gen.</HI> 21. 23, 24, 31. Consider also that other instance in <HI>Abraham; Gen.</HI> 24. 2, 3, 9. who would not give his servant an oath rashly, nor exercise his au|thority to impose on his conscience. It is evident also from the example of <HI>Isaac,</HI> who made a Covenant, and swore to <HI>Abimelech; Gen.</HI> 26. 28, 31, And from the example of <HI>Iacob,</HI> who made a Covenant with, and swore to his Uncle <HI>Laban,</HI> by the fear of his

Father <HI>Isaac; Gen.</HI> 31. 53. That is, by God, who is called <HI>our fear,</HI> by reason of the filial awe, and fear we ought to stand in before him; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 8. 13. (7) Because, the reasons and usefulness of Oaths, are perpetual, and the same to us under the Gospel, as they were to them under the Law. There is as much need of oaths for ending of strife in this litigious age, as there could be in former times. (8) Because, oaths were once lawful, therefore they are lawful still; unless the Ad|versaries prove them repealled; which they must do, not by stealing out of the Scripture single words by themselves, making one part contradict another. (9) Because, we need not fear to imitate any thing, which is done in Heaven. Our Lord has taught us to pray, <HI>thy will be done in Earth, as it is done in Heaven.</HI> But the Angel (says <HI>Iohn; Rev.</HI> 10. 5, 6.) which I saw stand upon the Sea, and upon the Earth, lifted up his hand to Heaven, <HI>and swore by him that liveth for ever and ever.</HI> That Angel, calls himself our fellow-servant, and of our brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this Book; <HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 9.

<P><HI>IS it the duty of the Civil Magistrate, to take order, that all Blasphemies, and Heresies be suppressed, all the ordinances of God,</HI>

<HI>duely settled, administred, and observed; all abuses in worship, and discipline reformed, all Idolaters, Gainsayers, and other obstinate dissenters, be oblig|ed and forced to quite their tenets and opinions, and conform themselves to the true worship, and service of God, according to his Law?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Isaiah</HI> 49. 23. 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 15. 12, 13. 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 34. 33. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 18. 4. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 23. 1, to the 26 verse. <HI>Ezra</HI> 7. 23, 25, 26, 27, 28. <HI>Lev.</HI> 24. 16.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Quakers, <HI>and other</HI> Sectaries <HI>err,</HI> who judge <HI>it Antichristian, and the practise of the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>that the Ci|vil and Supream Magistrate, with the assistance of the Church, and her Censures, should by his coactive power, force, and oblige all his subjects, to a Refor|mation of Religion, and to a conformity to the true worship, sound doctrine, and discipline, of the Church?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, it is foretold by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> that in the dayes of the Gospel, Kings shall be nursing Fathers, and Queens nursing Mothers, to the Church of God; <HI>Chap.</HI> 49. 23. (2) Because, <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> who was but a Heathen King, was very careful to make a decree, that whatsoever was commanded by the God of Heaven, should be diligently
<PB N="209" REF="121">
done for the house of the God of Heaven. And that whosoever would not obey the Law of GOD, and the King, judgement was to be executed speedi|ly upon him, whether by death, banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment. For which singular mercy, <HI>Ezra</HI> blessed the Lord GOD of his Fathers, who had put such a thing in the Kings heart; <HI>chap.</HI> 7. 23, 25, 26, 27, 28. So did <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> make a decree, that if any People, Nation, or Lan|guage, should speak any thing amiss against the GOD of Heaven, they should be cut in pieces, and their houses made a dunghill; <HI>Dan.</HI> 3. 29. The like we read of <HI>Darius,</HI> who made a Decree, that all men should tremble and fear before the GOD of <HI>Daniel, chap.</HI> 6. 26. (3) From the example of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> who removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen Serpent, to which the <HI>Israelites</HI> did burn incense; 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 18. 4. (4) From the example of <HI>Iosiah,</HI> who made a through reformation; and made all <HI>Israel</HI> to serve the LORD their GOD. The word in the Original importeth, that he in a manner forced, and compelled them to the pure worship, and service of God, as a servant is forced, and compelled to his work.
<PB N="210" REF="122">
He by his Royal Power, and Authority kept them in order, forbidding Idolatry, and commanding them to serve God no other|wise, than according to his Word; 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 34. 33. and 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 15. 12, 13. They en|tered into a Covenant, to seek the Lord of their Fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soul: that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of <HI>Israel should be put to death,</HI> whether great or small, man or wo|man. (5) Because, whosoever blasphemed the name of the Lord, was surely put to death; <HI>Lev.</HI> 24. 16. This blaspheming, was a peircing through, or stabbing the name of the Lord, as the original word properly signifies: which may be done not only after this manner, but by maintaining blasphe|mous errors, and heresies. (6) Because, the supream Magistrate is <HI>Custos utriusque Tabulae,</HI> a Keeper of both Tables of the Law of God. As well of the first Table, which relates to Religion, and our duty to God; as of the second which relates to righteousness, and our duty to our neighbour. If then, he may punish evil doers, who offend against the se|cond Table, and force and compel them to obedience, by the sword of justice, which God hath put into his hand, much more may he punish Idolaters, and blasphemers, who
<PB N="211" REF="122">
offend against the first Table, and force and compell them to obedience: seeing there are many&punc; sins against the first Table, which are more hainous, and odious, than the sins a|gainst the second Table. And though it be the sinful practise of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to force men, and women, to be of their Re|ligion, which is superstitious, and Idolatrous, yet it is not so to others, who have the true religion among them. And though our blessed Saviour, and his Apostles did not use such means for propagating the Gospel, reserving the Glory of conquering of souls, to himself, and the power of his Spirit; yet he has taught nothing to the contrary, but that Kings and Magistrates, whom he has made nursing Fathers to his Church, may according to the laudable examples of the good Kings of <HI>Iuda,</HI> improve their power for Reformation, and maintainance of his own Religion. And though Religion, hath been much advanced by suffering, yet it will not infer, that a Christian Prince has not power to reform his own subjects, or extirpate blas|phemers, and Hereticks.</P>

<P>(1) Because, there is no power but of God, and the powers, which are, are ordained of GOD; <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 1.

<HI>unlawful, now under the</HI> New Testa|ment, <HI>to wage warr?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, GOD appointed, and com|manded lawful war; <HI>Numb.</HI> 31. 2. For it is said, the Spirit of the Lord came upon <HI>Gi|deon,</HI> when he was to fight the battles of the Lord, against the <HI>Midianites,</HI> and <HI>Amalekites; Iudges</HI> 6. 34. Nay, the Lord himself, pre|scribeth the manner, and way of making of War; <HI>Numb.</HI> 10. 9. <HI>Numb.</HI> 31. 27. <HI>Deut</HI> 20. 2. And giveth knowledge, and skill, to his Generals, and Heroes, to fight his own bat|tles; <HI>Psalm</HI> 18. 34. <HI>Psalm</HI> 144. 1. All which are in no wise abrogated, and taken away, under the <HI>New Testament.</HI> (2) Because, the <HI>Centurion,</HI> that was converted to the Faith, did not lay down his office of a Captain of a hundred; which surely, he would have done, if to war under the <HI>New Testament,</HI> had been unlawful; <HI>Acts</HI> 10. 1, 2, 47. The same may be said of the believing <HI>Centurion; Matth.</HI> 8. 8, 9, 10. (3) Because, the office of a Souldier, is not reprehended, and reprov|ed, by <HI>Iohn the Baptist,</HI> but rather approven: <HI>Luke</HI> 3. 14. (4) Because, opposition, and defence, against unjust violence which often times cannot be done, without war, is the

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ hath given no such power to Magistrates: as evidently appears, from all those places of Scripture, where mention is made of the keyes. There is not in them, one syllabe, of the Civil Magistrate; <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 17. <HI>Matth</HI> 16. 19. (2) If the power of the keyes of the Kingdom of Hea|ven, agree to the Magistrate, as a Magistrate, then ought it to agree, to every Magistrate, though the Magistrate were an Infidel, or a Woman, which is absurd. (3) A Magi|strate,

as a Magistrate is not a Minister of the Church, as is evident, from all the Ca|talogues of the Ministers of the Church.

<P>(1) Because, we are commanded to sub|mit our selves to every ordinance of man; 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 2. 13. Namely in all that they com|mand us, if it be not contrary to God and his command; otherwise, (according to <HI>Acts</HI> 4. 19.) it is better to obey GOD than man. And it is said, for the <HI>Lords sake,</HI> that is, be|cause it is GODS will to govern us by them.

(3) Because, the same Apostle writing to <HI>Titus,</HI> bids him exhort the Cretians his hearers, to obey Magistrates, what manner of ones soever they be, not only believing ones, but also those, that are unbelieving, as then, they were yet most of them; <HI>Titus.</HI> 3. 1. (4) Because, when the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was persued for his life, and charged with matters criminal, he appeal|led unto <HI>Cesar; Acts</HI> 25. 10, 11.

<P>Well then, <HI>do not some err, who deny this?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, <HI>Samuel</HI> at the request of <HI>Saul,</HI> whom he knew the Lord had rejected, re|turned again after him, and honoured him before the people; 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15. 31. (2) Because, the Lord having appointed Magistrates to administer justice and judgement in his name, is so far pleased to honour them, as to call them Gods, and the Children of the

<P>(4) Because, even heathen Magistrates, are called the Lords anointed; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 45. 1. And the Lord calls <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> his ser|vant; <HI>Ierem.</HI> 27. 6. If then such Magistrates ought to be honoured upon that account, much more Christian Magistrates.

<P><PB N="226" REF="130"><HI>Is it lawful for a man, to have more than one wife, or for a woman, to have more than one husband at the same time?</HI></P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the having of two wives, or many wives, is contrary to the first in|stitution of Marriage, for the Lord gave to <HI>Adam,</HI> one wife only; <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 24. (2) Be|cause, the Law of God forbidds expresly <HI>Bigamie,</HI> or two wives; <HI>Lev.</HI> 18. 18. (3) Be|cause, the Lord doth find fault sharply, with <HI>Polygamie,</HI> many wives; <HI>Mal.</HI> 2. 14, 15. (4) Because, Christ says, he that puts away his wife (except in the case of Adulte|ry) and marries another, committeth a|dultery; <HI>Matth.</HI> 19. 9. But if it were lawful to have at one time, more wives than one, he should not be guilty of adultery in marrying another, whether he put away the former wife or not. (5) Because, <HI>Bi|gamie</HI> and <HI>Polygamie,</HI> take away the true peace of a wedded life, as is evident from the

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, marriage is honourable a|mong all men, and the bed undefiled; <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 4. (2) Because, the Apostle commands, for avoiding fornication, every man to have his own wife, and every woman to have her own husband; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 2.

<P><HI>OUght marriage to be within the degrees of consanguinity, or affinity forbidden in the Word?</HI></P>
<P>No.</P>
<P><HI>Can incestuous marriages ever be made lawful, by any law of man, or consent of parties, so as these Persons, may live together, as man, and wife?</HI></P>
<P>No. 1 <HI>Cor,</HI> 5. 1. <HI>Amos</HI> 2. 7. <HI>Mark</HI> 6. 18. <HI>Lev.</HI> 18. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>doth not the</HI> Popish-Church <HI>err, that speaks in the decrees of the Council of</HI> Trent, <HI>after this manner. If any man affirm, that these degrees only of Consanguinity or Affinity, which are set down in</HI> Leviticus, <HI>may hinder a contract of Marriage to be made, or may dissolve a marriage contract already made; and that the Church hath not power to dispense with some of these degrees (that</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="131">
<HI>is to say to permit incest) or may not make new Laws, and constitute far more forbidden degrees, than are exprest in</HI> Leviticus, <HI>let him be an</HI> Ana|thema, <HI>and accursed?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Before this be done, take notice, that there are here two heads to be considered.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> Whether or not we must stand, to the forbidden degrees of Consanguinity and Affinity ex|prest in <HI>Leviticus:</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether, to these degrees set down as forbidden in Leviticus, new degrees may be added by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> which will render a marriage incestuous?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To which we answer, that it is not in the power of any creature to dispense (that is to say, to suffer that to be used, which is for|bidden by the Law of God) with any of these Laws in <HI>Leviticus,</HI> which forbid <HI>incestuous mar|riages.</HI></P>
<P>And next, we affirm, neither is it in the power of any creature, to add to these degrees forbidden in <HI>Leviticus,</HI> any other which are not forbidden,</P>
<P>(1) Because, such a power of dispensing, is not to be found in all the Scripture. (2) Because, the Lord sayes expresly, what thing soever I command you, observe to do it:
<PB N="230" REF="132">
thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it; <HI>Deut.</HI> 12. 32. But the Lord himself hath made these Laws, and establish|ed these Marches so sure, that no <HI>Council,</HI> no <HI>Pope,</HI> no <HI>Creature,</HI> can either dispense with any of them, or add new ones to them. See <HI>Leviticus</HI> 18. (3) Because, these Laws are of common, and perpetual right; and there|fore cannot be dispensed with.

<HEAD>Quest. IV.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IS it lawful to marry a second wife, after the first is dead?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Is it lawful after divorce to marry another, as if the offending party were dead?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 31, 32. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 2. 3. <HI>Matth.</HI> 19. 9.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Novatians, <HI>the</HI> Pu|ritans <HI>of old, truely so called: and the</HI> Tertul|lianists <HI>err, who absolutely condemned second marriages?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>This absurd tenet is confuted from Rom.</HI> 7. 2, 3. <HI>and from</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 39.</P>
<P><HI>Do not likewise the</HI> Papists <HI>err, who deny,</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="132">
<HI>that after divorce, second marriages are permitted to Christians?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>But here by two distinctions they explain their mind.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>They distinguish between</HI> Cohabitation, <HI>the</HI> Bed, <HI>and the</HI> Ty.</P>
<P><HI>The first is, the dwelling together of man and woman, in one family.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The second is, the right of giving, and requiring due benevolence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The third is that, whereby both are made one: whereby the one cannot but be the others while they are both living.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They distinguish next, between persons that are believers, and that are unbelievers. If then both parties, or one of them be unbelievers, they grant that the marriage is valide, both as to</HI> Cohabita|tion, <HI>to the</HI> marriage bed; <HI>and to the</HI> Ty, <HI>or</HI> Bond.</P>
<P><HI>But if both parties be Christians, they think that the marriage may be dissolved, as to</HI> bedding together, <HI>and</HI> Cohabitation, <HI>yet the</HI> Bond <HI>standeth sure, and abideth unloosable: especially, if the marriage be contracted after Baptism: and therefore a second marriage after divorce is unlawful to any of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But this is easily confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ permitted marriage
<PB N="232" REF="133">
after divorce; <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 31, 32. <HI>Matth.</HI> 19. 9. Here Christ forbidding a man to put away his wife, and to marry another, in express words, excepts the case of <HI>Fornication.</HI> Therefore he suffers a man to put away his wife in the case of <HI>Fornication,</HI> and to marry another. (2) Because, the Apostle says, but if the unbelieving depart, let him depart: for a brother, or sister, is not under bondage in such cases; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 15. Therefore, if a brother or sister, when there is such a wil|ful and obstinate desertion, be not under bondage, then surely the <HI>Bond</HI> is dissolved: and all remedies being tryed in vain, for bringing back the obstinate party, I doubt not, but the innocent party may marry another without blame. If this be, then much more may the innocent party marry another, when a Divorce is obtained.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>Quest. V.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IS nothing but Adultery, or such wilful desertion, as can no way be remedied, by the Church, or Civil Magistrate, a sufficient cause of dissolving the bond of Marriage?</HI></P>
<P>Nothing. <HI>Matth.</HI> 19. 8, 9. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 15. <HI>Matth.</HI> 19. 6.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Enthusiasts, <HI>and</HI> Familists <HI>err, who maintain, that it is free to a man, to put away his wife when he pleaseth?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="133">Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the God of <HI>Israel</HI> hatteth putting away; <HI>Mal.</HI> 2. 16. (2) Because, whosoever putteth away his wife, except in case of Fornication, he causeth her to com|mit Adultery; <HI>Matth.</HI> 5, 32. (3) Because, the Apostle says, art thou bound to a wife, seek not to be loosed; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 27.</P>
<P><HI>Do not likewise the</HI> Papists <HI>err, who main|tain that there are other causes of divorce, than A|dultery and wilful desertion?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>They first tell us, that marriage contracted, but not consummated, may be dissolved; to wit, by a Monastick Vow of a perpetual single life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They tell us secondly, that infidelity, and here|sie are just causes of divorce. So say the</HI> Anabap|tists.</P>
<P><HI>And thirdly, they tell us that murder committed upon the hope of getting such a Match, is a suf|ficient cause of divorce.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That coldness, perpetual impotency, and such like fancies are causes?</HI></P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ says, what God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder, <HI>Matth.</HI> 19. 6. But marriage contracted, and ratified, though not consummated, is made
<PB N="234" REF="134">
by God: therefore it cannot be dissolved by man. Neither ought any man once marri|ed, to turn a <HI>Monck;</HI> for a single life is only fit for those, that have the gift of Continen|cy; for God commands them, that have it not, to marry; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 9. (2) Neither can infidelity, or heresie, be a ground of divorce, as is clear from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 12, 13. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman that hath an husband, that believeth not, if he be pleased, to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</P>

<P>(1) Because, the visible Church, is com|pared to a Garner, in which there is not only Wheat, but Chaff mixed with it. To a Field, in which Tares, and Darnel are mix|ed among the good Corn.

(4) From the Pa|rable of the Banquet, where one was found at the Table, without a Wedding Garment; <HI>Matth.</HI> 22. 11. (5) Because, many are of the Visible Church, who are not of the in|visible Church; 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 2. 19.

(13) Because, Christ had a visible church on earth many hundered of years before ever there were such cattle as <HI>Quakers</HI> in the <HI>World.</HI> Unless they will alledge that the primitive Christians and all the Saints, since the Apostles dayes, have been their Predecessors, and claime kin to them, as the <HI>Samaritans</HI> did to <HI>Iacob,</HI> who were truely descended of the heathen; who were brought thither out of <HI>Assyria,</HI> as

<P>But how quite different, the <HI>Quakers</HI> are to the primitive christians, and holy men of God then, and since, will evidently ap|pear hence, that they did not contemn these two great ordinances of the Gospel instituted by Christ, to wit, <HI>Baptism and the Lords Supper.</HI> They had Bishops and Deacons to govern, and instruct them, who were or|dained to their functions by prayer and im|position of hands, whom they did not re|vile, with the ugly names of dumb dogs, and hirelings.

<P>(1) Because, that God commanded in|fants, and little ones, should stand before him; should enter into covenant with him; <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 10, 11.

And so there shall be no difference between the children of <HI>Believers,</HI> and the children of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Pagans.</HI> (5) Because, infants un|der the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> had right unto the Co|venant of Grace; <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7, 12. And children of Believers under the <HI>New Testament</HI> have lost no right to that covenant of Grace, which children under the <HI>Old Testament</HI> had; seeing the covenant of Grace, now under

<HEAD>Question I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ARE the Saints bound by profession, to maintain an holy fellowship, and commu|nion in the worship of GOD, in perform|ing such other spiritual duties, as tend to their mu|tual edification?</HI></P>
<P>Ye,. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 24, 25. <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 42. 46. <HI>Isa.</HI> 2. 3. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 20.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>did not the</HI> Donatists <HI>of old, and</HI> Separatists <HI>now err, who maintain, that Hypo|crites and wicked men, do pollute, and defile the worship of God, not only to themselves, but also to others that worship with them: and that there|fore, we must separate from Communion in the wor|ship of God, because of them?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Church of the <HI>Iews</HI> in Christs time was very corrupt; <HI>Matth.</HI> 15. 7.
<PB N="258" REF="146">
<HI>Mark</HI> 6, 7, 8. And yet both by his pra|ctise, and his command, he would not have his hearers to separate from it. For he both observed the feasts, and preached in their Synagogues; <HI>Iohn</HI> 8. 1. <HI>Luke</HI> 4. 15. <HI>Iohn</HI> 10. 22. And he commands his hearers to ob|serve what the <HI>Scribes,</HI> and <HI>Pharisees</HI> bad them do; <HI>Matth.</HI> 23. 2, 3. (2) Because, the Apostle is so far from commanding separa|tion from the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> that he praises their meetings; (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 4. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 20. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 23.) notwithstanding of the many gross scandals, which were among them; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 11, 12, 13. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 1, 2. And 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 12, 13. (3) Because, the Apostles calls the <HI>Galatians, the Church of Christ, brethren, and the children of God,</HI> who were yet in some measure removed from GOD, to another Gospel. Nay, says <HI>Paul,</HI> O foolish, (or senseless) <HI>Galatians,</HI> who hath bewitched you, (that is, so blinded the eyes of your understanding, that ye cannot see the right truth; as the <HI>Iuglars</HI> bewitch the outward eyes, that men think they see that which they see not) that ye should not obey the truth; <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 1. And yet since it was a constitute true Church, it was his judgement, there should be no separation from it, notwithstanding of all the foresaid
<PB N="259" REF="146">
faults. (4) Because, the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> was a true Church, though they made de|fection from their first love. So was the Church of <HI>Pergamus,</HI> though there were in it who held the doctrine of <HI>Balaam.</HI> So was the Church of <HI>Thyatira,</HI> notwithstanding that they suffered <HI>Iesebel,</HI> that called her self a prophetess, and taught the servants of Christ to commit Fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to Idols. (5) If we must separate from the Communion of the Church in things lawful, for the faults of others, of for the faults of Ministers, and if their sins pollute the worship of God to others, than, we must not keep communion with any Church: seeing there can hardly be a Church where there are not some hidden Hypocrites. Nay, where there are not some, who are known to be such by the Minister. Yet such are not to be excluded, as Christ himself teaches; <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. 24. to 31. See the 47. and 48. verses of that same chapter. (6) If the worship be polluted to some, for the faults of others, with whom they worship, then must the Word and Sacraments, have their efficacy and worth from the Persons, that worship, and from the dispensers of them, which is absurd. (7) Because, wick|ed and evil men, do not pollute the worship
<PB N="260" REF="147">
to others, but to themselves only; as it ap|pears from the man, that wanted the wed|ding Garment; <HI>Matth.</HI> 22. 11. And from those who did eat and drink unworthily at the Lords Table. Such do not eat and drink damnation to others, but to themselves; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 27, 29.&punc;</P>

<HEAD>Quest. II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DOth this Communion, which the Saints have with Christ, make them in any wise partakers of the Substance of his God-head, or equal with him in any respect?</HI></P>
<P>No.</P>
<P><HI>Is there a mixture of the Divine Essence, with the Substance of all the Creatures, because the Divine Essence is infinite, and every where pre|sent?</HI></P>
<P>No.</P>
<P><HI>Doth every r&egrave;generate man, that is united with God, by vertue of this union, become God the maker of Heaven and Earth?</HI></P>
<P>No.</P>
<P><HI>Are all the Acts of a mans will, and all his actions, even his most cursed, and wicked actions, wholly Divine, which to resist, and contradict is rebellion against God?</HI></P>
<P>No. <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 14. <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 18, 19.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Familists <HI>err, who teach, that the Saints are made God, and Christ,</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="147">
<HI>by an Essential and Corporal Union with them?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Do not likewise the</HI> Manicheans <HI>err, who blasphemously taught, that the Divine Essence, was mingled with soul and body of every man, and that therefore all his Actions were wholly Di|vine?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the personal union is given to none, but to Christ only; <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 14. The Word was made Flesh, that is, a true man like unto us in all things, yet without sin. (2) Because, in him dwelleth all the fulness of the God-head bodily. Namely by an essential inhabitation of the Son of God in the humane nature, by the uniting of his Divine Nature with the Humane, in the unity of his Person. <HI>Bodily,</HI> that is Personally, Essentially, and Truely. (3) Because, the union of the Saints with Christ is by Faith, not indeed by a personal Union; <HI>Eph.</HI> 3. 17. (4). Because, there is no man that sinneth not; 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 8, 10. (5) Be|cause, Gods Essence, is most simple, and single, and infinitely above and beyond all creatures; <HI>Exod.</HI> 3. 14. (6) Because, <HI>holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of Hosts; Isaiah</HI> 6. 3. (7) Because, <HI>Solomon</HI> in his prayer says, be|hold
<PB N="262" REF="148">
the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have builded to thy Name; 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 8. 27. (8) Because, the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> says, behold the Nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are as the smallest dust of the ballance e|stemed; <HI>chap.</HI> 40. 15. (9) Because, the <HI>Ma|nichean</HI> error, is the outmost stretch of <HI>Satans</HI> invention, beyond which he is not able to go.

<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Anabaptists <HI>err, who affirm, that the goods and possessions of the Saints ought to be common?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, in the time of the primitive Church, no man was obliged out of necessity to deliver his goods. Neither did believers loss their right and propriety which they had to them; <HI>Acts</HI> 5. 4. (2) Because, the eight command, which is of perpetual use

<P><HI>ARE the Sacraments holy signs and seals of the Covenant of Grace, immediatly insti|tuted by GOD, to represent Christ, and his benefits; and to confirm our interest in him?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Do the Sacraments put a visible difference, be|tween those that belong unto the Church, and the rest of the World?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Do the Sacraments solemnly engage men and women to the service of God in Christ, according to his word?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="149">Yes. <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7, 10. <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 23. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 16. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 25, 26. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 7. <HI>Rom.</HI> 15. 8. <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 48. <HI>Gen.</HI> 34. 14. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 3, 4.

<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Socinians <HI>err, with the</HI> Anabaptists, <HI>who maintain, that the Sacra|ments, are not seals of the Covenant of Grace, in|stituted by God, to represent Christ and his benefits: but only bare tokens, and Tests of our Christian profession?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Circumcision is expresly cal|led a sign, and seal of the righteousness of Faith; <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. Now, if Circumcision was a seal, and sign; why ought not Baptism, and the Lords Supper to be signs, and seals also? (2) Because, the names, and pro|perties of the things signified, are given to the Sacramental signs. Thus Circumcision is called the Covenant; <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 10. The bread is called the Body of Christ; <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 26. And Baptism is called the washing of regeneration; <HI>Titus</HI> 3. 5. For no other reasons, but because they represent and con|firm things spiritual to Believers. (3) Be|cause, the cup of blessing in the Sacrament, is the communion of the blood of Christ; and
<PB N="265" REF="149">
the bread is the communion of the body of Christ; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 16. (4) Because, the Sa|craments bring into our memories, Christ and his benefits; and therefore, as it were, they set him before our eyes, and so increase and confirm our faith: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 24, 25.</P>

<HEAD>Quest. II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IS the Grace, which is exhibited in, or by the Sacraments, rightly used; conferred by any power in them?</HI></P>
<P>No. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 28, 29. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3. 21.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Papists <HI>and</HI> Lutheri|ans <HI>err, who maintain, that the Sacraments of themselves are true, immediate, and effectual causes of our Iustification, and give life?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the holy Scripture attributes our Justification to Faith only, as an instru|mental cause, and to no other thing; <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 28. <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 16. And therefore the Sacraments cannot be the efficient causes of our Justification, and life. (2) Because, the Scripture makes an express difference, between the work of a man dispensing the Sacraments, and the work of the holy Ghost; <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. 11. (3) Because, signs and seals of Grace cannot confer, and effectuat Grace.
<PB N="266" REF="150">
But the Sacraments, are but signs and seals of Grace; because to <HI>signifie, and to have ver|tue,</HI> and <HI>power to do</HI> differ in <HI>nature</HI> and in <HI>kind.</HI> (4) Because, many are partakers of the Sacra|ments, who yet are not partakers of the Grace of GOD, as <HI>Simon Magus; Acts</HI> 8. 13. <HI>Ananias,</HI> and <HI>Saphira; Acts</HI> 5. 4, 9. And how many thousands do eat and drink unworthily, drinking and eating damnation to themselves; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 29.

<P><HI>Do not lastly the</HI> Papists <HI>err, who maintain, that to the perfection of a Sacrament, the actual</HI>

intention <HI>of the Minister, at least his</HI> vertual in|tention <HI>of doing that, which the Church doth, is necessary?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, <HI>Iudas</HI> who was a Thief, and a Traitour, did according to the command of Christ baptize, as well as the rest: yet Christ, never called in question his Baptism. (2) Because, the efficacy of the Word, doth not depend upon the piety, goodness, worthi|ness, or good intention of the Instrument; <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 16: Therefore, neither doth the ef|ficacy of a Sacrament depend upon the inten|tion of him, that doth administer it. (3) If the efficacy of Baptism depended upon the good intention of the Minister, then no Christian could be sure, that he is baptized: seeing no man can be sure of, or know the Ministers intention. (4) Because, the ope|ration, and efficacy of the Sacraments, de|pend upon the operation of the Holy Ghost, and the Word of institution; <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. 11. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12, 13. (5) Because, the <HI>Papists</HI> themselves (which is <HI>argumentum ad hominem</HI>) cannot be sure, that the bread in the Eucharist is Transubstantiat into the Body of Christ. And therefore in their Adorati|on, and falling down to the Host, they com|mit

most damnable Idolatry in worshipping that which is neither GOD, nor any divine thing. I say, they cannot be sure, because the Priests intention, may be deficient, while he is consecrating the Bread.</P>

<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, no other Sacraments, save Baptism and the Lords Supper are instituted by Christ, in all the holy Scripture. (2) Be|cause, the description, and definition of a Sacrament, as you will find it in the first Question; doth agree only to Baptism, and the Lord, Supper, (3) Because, Christ was a Copartner, and sharer of Baptism, and the Lords Supper, which in his own per|son, he did sanctifie, and by them did testi|fie and profess his communion with his

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ gave the power of dispensing the Sacraments to them only, to whom he gave the power of Preaching; <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. But the power of preaching is not given to all men; <HI>Heb.</HI> 5. 4. (2) Because, all that ever did dispense the Sacrament of Baptism in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> were either called Ordinarly, or Extraordinarly: as is evident from the examples of <HI>Iohn the Bap|tist,</HI>
<PB N="270" REF="152">
and the disciples of Christ. From the example of <HI>Peter; Acts</HI> 2. 41. From the example of <HI>Philip, Acts</HI> 8. 38. From the example of <HI>Ananias; Acts</HI> 9. 18. From the example of <HI>Paul and Silas; Acts</HI> 16. 15. 33. (3) Because, it is unlawful for any man, to affix the Kings seal to a Charter, or Letters|patent, unless he be a person authorized, and deputed by the King for that use. But the Sacraments are seals, of the Covenant between God and his people; <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. (4) Because, women are not permitted to speak publickly in the Church: therefore they have no power, to dispense the Sacra|ment of Baptism; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 34. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 12. (5) Because, the Adversaries grant that it is unlawful to women, or Laicks to administer the Lords Supper: therefore it is as unlawful for them to administer Baptism. No just cause of reason, or disparity can be given. (6) Because, the benefit of regeneration is not tyed (as the Adversaries may dream) to the outward Baptism, as is clear and evi|dent from the conversion of the <HI>Thief</HI> upon the cross. And from 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3. 21. There|fore, there is no such necessity of Baptism, as the <HI>Papists,</HI> and <HI>Lutherians</HI> do fancy.</P>

<P><HI>IS the Sacrament of Baptism with Water by Christs appointment, to be continued in his Church to the end of the World?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19, 20.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Quakers <HI>err, who maintain, that</HI> Baptism <HI>with</HI> Water, <HI>is not an Ordinance of Divine institution, and that there is no Gospel precept for it?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="153"><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ taking his fare-well of his Disciples, gave them this Commission, <HI>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, Baptising them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</HI> Or according to the Original Word, <HI>make all Nations Disciples,</HI> by your Doctrine, <HI>Baptising them, in the Name of, &amp;c.</HI> All which words are spoken with one breath. Whence it is clear, that the same very persons that were commanded to make all Nations Dis|ciples by their Doctrine, were commanded to baptise them. But it was not in their power to administer the <HI>Inward Baptism;</HI> that is, to baptise with the holy Ghost, and with fire. Men may well administer the Water, or external sign; but it is Christ that be|stowes the inward Grace, and thing signifi|ed; as is clear from <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. 11. where <HI>Iohn the Baptist,</HI> sayes, I indeed baptise you with Water unto Repentance, but he that com|eth after me, shall baptise you with the holy Ghost, and with fire. If any man had re|ceived this power of Baptising with the Holy Ghost, then surely <HI>Iohn</HI> should have receiv|ed it, whom Jesus so highly commends, as, that <HI>there was not a greater than he born of wo|men; Matth.</HI> 11. 11. And though our Sa|viour subjoyns, he that is least in the king|dom
<PB N="274" REF="154">
of Heaven, is greater than he, yet this will not infer, that any among the Teachers of the Gospel, had the power of baptising with the holy Ghost, which he had not; but only, that they did shew Christ more clear|ly, as having most perfectly accomplished whatsoever was requisite to our salvation; and did publish this, not only to the <HI>Iews,</HI> but also to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And so Christ as the Master employed only the Disciples, as his servants to dispense and act ministerially in his service, reserving the blessing of their em|ployments to himself. Now, baptizing with the holy Ghost, is the greatest blessing of the Gospel, and so cannot flow but from Christ himself. (2) Because, the Disciples of Christ acted only ministerially under him in working of miracles: therefore they could not administer baptism, with the holy Ghost, seing this is a greater power, than the other. The cureing of the soul is a far greater work, than to cure miraculously the body. The work of Conversion, and re|generation, is a work beyond the creating of heaven and earth. There was only here, the introducing of a new Form, but no con|trary Form, or quality to be expelled.

That they acted only Ministerially under Christ, it is evident from what <HI>Peter</HI> sayes, ye men of <HI>Israel,</HI> why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power and godliness, we made this man to walk; <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 12.

The word in the Original is <HI>Matheteusate,</HI> Teach, Instruct, or make Disciples all Na|tions, or make Disciples among all Nations, baptising them. The signification of this <HI>Greek</HI> word may be gathered from <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 1. where it is said, that the Pharisees had heard, that Jesus
<PB N="279" REF="156">
<HI>made Disciples.</HI> So that <HI>Matheteuein</HI> and <HI>Mathe|tas poiein,</HI> are both one thing.

That Baptism succeeds to Circumci|sion, is evident first, because, they both seal up, the same very thing. Next, as Circum|cision was the initiating Seal, under the Old Testament, so is Baptism under the New: be|cause the Apostles did administer it so early to the Disciples at the first appearing of their new birth, and interest in the Covenant. Moreover, because by Baptism, we are said to put on Christ; <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 27.

(5) Because, that Baptism, without faith, and the inward operation of the holy Spirit, hath no efficacy to Salvation; <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3. 21. (6) Because, the Baptism of the Spirit, at one time goes before, at an|other time follows Baptism with water; <HI>Acts</HI> 10. 37. <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. 11. (7) Because, very many that are baptized within the visible Church, are damned; <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. 13, 14. (8) Because, in those that are come to age, Faith, and Repentance, are pre-required to Baptism; and therefore before they be bap|tized, they have the beginning of regenera|tion; <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 38. (9) Because, not all that are baptized are elected; <HI>Matth.</HI> 20. 16. But all that are elected by GOD, are in time re|generated; 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 1. 2.

(11)
<PB N="282" REF="158">
Because, Baptism is not a converting, but a confirming Ordinance, even as the Lords Supper is.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Papists <HI>do otherwise contradict the second part, in affirming, that the vertue and efficacy of Baptism (as to the abolishing, and sealing up the remission of more grievous sins and faillings, which they call</HI> Mortal) <HI>doth not extend it self, to the time to come, but to the time past: so that if the person baptized, fall into some deadly and dangerous sin, which wounds the conscience, there is need of another Sacrament, to wit,</HI> Pennance, <HI>whereby the remission of that</HI> Mortal sin, <HI>as they call it, is sealed up unto him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Sacrament of Baptism, after the administration thereof doth not cease to be a Sacrament, of the blood of Christ which purgeth us from all our sins; <HI>Mark</HI> 1. 4. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 7. (2) Because, justi|fication by faith (which is sealed up to us by Baptism; <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 11, 12.) is for all sins committed before and after bap|tism; <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 36.

as their Ring-leaders do, or ignorantly, or by a delusion from the Devll, as the most part do, the most sure and evident Truths in Scripture, pratling and gagling in their dis|course, sense, and nonsense, being oftner out of purpose, than in a purpose, skipping from one subject to another, to save themselves from the strength of reason, like <HI>subtile Foxes,</HI> which when they are beaten from one hole, flie into another.

<P><HI>DO the outward Elements in this Sacrament, in substance, and nature remain still, truely, and only bread and wine, as they were before?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 29. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 26, 27, 28.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Papists <HI>err, who maintain, that the Bredd and Wine, by the power of the words of consecration</HI> This is my Body, <HI>are truely Transubstantiat into the very body and blood of Christ; nothing remaining but the outward forms, and Accidents of the Bread and wine?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Doctrine of <HI>Transubstantia|tion</HI> makes Christs body every where present, invisible, that cannot be handled, without shape, and figure, without humane quanti|ty, which is contrary to <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 6. Here Christ is only present in <HI>Bethany.</HI> And <HI>Iohn</HI> 20. 27. <HI>Thomas</HI> toucheth Christ. And ac|cording to <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 21. the Heavens must receive Him; and therefore cannot be every
<PB N="294" REF="165">
where. See <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 14, 17. (2) Because, before and after consecration, the bread is called the communion of the body of Christ: but nothing is said, or can be the commu|nion of its own self; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 16. (3) Be|cause, afrer consecration, the Apostle calls not the bread, <HI>a Species or form of Bread;</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 26, 27, 28. And after consecration, Christ calls the wine the fruit of the vine; <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 29. (4) Because, Christ did in|stitute the Supper to be a <HI>memorial</HI> of himself until he come again. But a memorial, is not of things corporally present, but of things absent; 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 25. (5) Because, that which is properly broken, is not the bo|dy of Christ, but the bread is properly broken, therefore the bread is not the body of Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 16. (6) Because, Christ went up to heaven bodily, and is to tarry there until the end of the world; <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 21. (7) <HI>Tran|substantiation</HI> destroys the very <HI>Essence,</HI> and being of the Lords Supper. First, It de|stroyes the sign, because it takes away the substance of the <HI>bread and wine;</HI> the Acci|dents, and outward Forms only remaining. Secondly, It destroys the thing signified, for it robes and spoils the body of Christ, of its true quantity and dimensions (for according to that infallible <HI>Philosophical Maxim, sublatis</HI>
<PB N="295" REF="165">
<HI>dimensionibus corporis, tollitur ipsum corpus.</HI> That is, by taking away the <HI>length, breadth,</HI> and <HI>thickness</HI> of any Physical or Natural body, you destroy consequentially the very essence and being of that body) and introduces in|stead of one body, many bodies. (8) Because, <HI>Transubstantiation</HI> takes away the <HI>Sacramental Analogie:</HI> and so, when the sign is turned into the thing signified, all similitude be|tween them is gone, and ceaseth. (9) From this doctrine do follow many great Absur|dities inconsistent with Religion, Sense, and Reason. As first, that Christ in the Supper, did both eat and drink himself: that he was wholly in his own mouth: that he had a <HI>double and twofold body;</HI> one Visible, ano|ther Invisible: That a Mouse, or Rat, may <HI>eat Christs Body:</HI> That his body being reser|ved, and laid up into a Cupboard, in a short time may <HI>turn into Vermine.</HI> Must not <HI>Christs body be in many places at once?</HI> Must not <HI>his bo|dy,</HI> and all the parts thereof, his <HI>head, hands</HI> and <HI>feet</HI> be in the smallest, and least crumb of the <HI>Host?</HI> Must not Christs body, having now that bigness in Heaven, which he had upon Earth, be biger, than it self; longer, and thicker?</P>
<P>If Christs <HI>Body</HI> may be in diverse places at once, why may not a mans body be in di|verse

places at once? this is granted by the Adversaries) but a man cannot be in di|verse places at once.</P>
<P>Can <HI>Peter,</HI> for example, be both at <HI>Edin|burgh</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> in the same moment of time? He may then be both a man and not a man, at the same time: he may be a man, because living at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and not a man, because dead at <HI>London.</HI> May not <HI>Peter</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> go to <HI>York,</HI> and meet <HI>Peter</HI> there from <HI>London?</HI> And what a mirry meeting must it be, when <HI>Peter</HI> shakes hands with <HI>Peter,</HI> and takes a glass of Wine from him? May not <HI>Peter</HI> from <HI>London</HI> be killed there at <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> be left alive? May not <HI>Peter</HI> alive be re-produced in a thousand Cities at once, and <HI>marry</HI> there a thousand <HI>wives,</HI> and beget in one night a thousand <HI>Sons,</HI> and <HI>Daughters?</HI> May not <HI>Peter</HI> be so many times re-produced, till he make up an hundred thousand fighting men? May not one <HI>candle</HI> by re-production be made as many; as may give light to the whole <HI>Universe?</HI> May not one bottle of <HI>water</HI> be made so many, as may serve an <HI>Army</HI> of an hundred thousand? May not one <HI>Guiney</HI> be reproduced as many times as may amount to five and twenty hundred thousand pounds sterling? A brave invention for paying five
<PB N="297" REF="166">
or six hundred thousand merks of debt: Next, as the Adversaries are engaged to maintaine that one body may be in many places a, once, so are they under a necessity to affirm that many bodies may be in one place to|gether, by way of <HI>Penetration,</HI> for in every crumb of the <HI>Host,</HI> is Christs <HI>Body.</HI> From which position, it follows that a mans body may be contained within a <HI>Nut-shel.</HI> That a <HI>Snuff-box</HI> may contain <HI>Athurs Seat:</HI> the hol|low of an <HI>Ox eye,</HI> the whole <HI>Globe</HI> of the <HI>Earth.</HI> That a <HI>Sparrow</HI> may swallow, one by one, the seven <HI>Planets,</HI> seeing each one of them, may occupy no more bounds, or space, than a grain of <HI>barly corn</HI> doth: and yet the <HI>Sun</HI> which is swallowed, will be as big as at present: for Christs body in the <HI>Host,</HI> is as big and tall, as when he was on the Cross, as the Adversaries confess. (10) We never read of a miracle wrought by GOD, but what was evident, and conspi|cuous to all, and evidently seen to be such. As when <HI>Moses</HI> his <HI>rod</HI> was turned into a <HI>Ser|pent,</HI> and became a <HI>rod</HI> again; <HI>Exod.</HI> 4. 2, 3. Such were the wonders of <HI>Egypt.</HI> Such was the dividing of the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> the stricking of the <HI>Rock:</HI> and the flowing out of the <HI>waters; Numb.</HI> 20. 11. The destruction of <HI>Korah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> was evident to all the

<HI>Israelites; Numb.</HI> 16. 31, 32. So were the mi|racles, which were wrought by the holy Pro|phets, such were the <HI>miracles</HI> which Christ and his Apostles wrought. Was not the water most evidently turned into wine; <HI>Iohn</HI> 2. 7, 8, 9. But after the Words of <HI>consecrationn</HI> uttered by the <HI>Mass Priest,</HI> the bread as to sense, is the same thing it was. The bread hath the same taste, th&egrave; same smell, that same touch, that same outward form, and figure, that same colour, that same weight. It occupies that same space and bounds, and hath the same quan|tity in all its dimensions. But the <HI>rod</HI> was seen a <HI>serpent,</HI> and the <HI>serpent</HI> was seen a <HI>rod.</HI> The water was seen wine: it was known to be wine by the <HI>taste,</HI> by the <HI>smell,</HI> by the <HI>colour.</HI> Christ never wrought such a miracle as the miracle of <HI>Transubstantiation.</HI> In all his miracles he appealed to our outward Senses.

<P><HI>IS the Body and Blood of Christ in this Sacrament corporally, or car|nally</HI> in, with, <HI>or</HI> under <HI>the br&egrave;ad and wine?</HI></P>
<P>No. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 16.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Lutherians <HI>err, who maintain, that the body and blood of Christ, are corporally</HI> in, with, <HI>and</HI> under <HI>the bread and</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="167">
<HI>wine: and that (as the</HI> Papists <HI>also teach) his body and blood, are taken corporally by the mouth, by all Communicants, believers, and unbelievers?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ was sitting with his body at the Table. (2) Because, he him|self did eat of the bread, and drink of the wine. (3) Because, he took bread from the Table: he took not his own body: he break bread, and did distribute it, he break not his own body: so he took the Cup, and not his own blood. (4) Because, Christ said, the Cup was the New Testament in his blood: but the Cup is not <HI>in, with,</HI> and <HI>under</HI> the <HI>Wine.</HI> (5) Because Christ said, the <HI>bread was his body, which was broken; the Wine was his blood, which was shed.</HI> But neither was his <HI>body broken under the bread,</HI> nor his <HI>blood shed under the Wine,</HI> seing Christ as yet, was not betrayed, crucified, and dead.</P>
<P>In the next place, the end of the <HI>Lords Sup|per</HI> is, that we may <HI>remember Christ,</HI> and de|clare his <HI>death until be come; Luke</HI> 22. 19. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 24, 25, 26. Therefore if Christ be now present with his <HI>body, in, with,</HI> and <HI>under</HI> the <HI>bread,</HI> the <HI>Sacramental remembrance</HI> of Christ, and the <HI>declaring of his death,</HI> ought to cease.</P>
<P>This Doctrine of <HI>Consubstantiation,</HI> is con|trary
<PB N="300" REF="168">
to the <HI>Articles</HI> of our Faith. It is a|gainst the Truth and Verity of his <HI>Humane Nature,</HI> which is <HI>visible, palpable,</HI> and in a cer|tain place <HI>circumscriptive.</HI> It is against the <HI>Ar|ticle of his ascension:</HI> for it makes <HI>his body,</HI> which is now in Heaven, until the <HI>last day,</HI> to be <HI>in, with,</HI> and <HI>under</HI> a piece of bread. It is against the <HI>spiritual communion of the Saints</HI> with Christ the <HI>Head,</HI> which the <HI>Lutherians</HI> makes by this <HI>doctrine</HI> a <HI>corporal</HI> and <HI>carnal com|munion,</HI> contrary to 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 3, 4. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1. 22. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4. 4. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 9. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 17. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 13. <HI>Iohn</HI> 15. 5.</P>
<P>It brings with it many and great absurdities; as that the <HI>body of Christ, Non habeat partem extra partem; hath not one part of it without another;</HI> but as if all the <HI>parts of his Body,</HI> were in one part, which is contrary to the <HI>Nature</HI> of a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real Quantum,</HI> which consists essentially in three <HI>dimensions, length, breadth,</HI> and <HI>thickness.</HI> It makes in effect <HI>his Body</HI> to be no body. It brings down the glorious <HI>Body of Christ</HI> from Heaven, and puts it under the base Elements of this Earth. It makes as many <HI>bodies of Christ,</HI> as there are <HI>pieces of Eucharistical bread.</HI> It makes <HI>his body</HI> to be broken <HI>in, with,</HI> and <HI>under</HI> the <HI>bread,</HI> and <HI>bruised</HI> with the teeth: It sends <HI>his Body</HI> down to the <HI>stomach,</HI> where it is turned into a <HI>mans substance,</HI> and afterwards <HI>throwen out.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="168">Moreover, all <HI>true Eating</HI> brings life and Salvation; <HI>Iohn</HI> 6. 50, 51. but <HI>eating</HI> by the mouth profiteth nothing; <HI>Iohn</HI> 6. 63.

<P><PB N="308" REF="172"><HI>Do not the same</HI> Erastians <HI>err, who make no distinction between Church power and the Secular power?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, Christ hath committed the keyes of the kingdom of Heaven to the Officers of his Church which are Gover|nours distinct from the civil Magistrate; <HI>Matth.</HI> 16. 18, 19. <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 19. <HI>Iohn</HI> 20. 21, 22, 23. (2) Because, Church power, and civil power differ specifically. The church, and the common-wealth are Polities formally, and essentially different. They are not, as such, powers subordinate, at least in a right line, but co-ordinate; <HI>Acts</HI> 4. 19, 20. 2 <HI>chron.</HI> 26. 18. Next, God the Creator and Governour of the World; is the Effici|ent of the power of the civil Magistrate; <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 1, 2, 4. But God-Christ, our blessed Mediator, and Lord of his church, is the Efficient of the church particularly, and of its Government. The matter (<HI>materia ex qua</HI>) of the civil Government, is the se|cular sword: but the matter of the church Government, are the keyes of the kingdom of Heaven. The matter of the civil Govern|ment (<HI>materia in qua</HI>) may be a Senate, many people, the Person of one king, of a

child. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="obscured" EXTENT="1 word"> woman. But the matter of the <HI>church government,</HI> is not of this kind; <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 22. 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 15. 1 <HI>cor.</HI> 14. 34, 35. The matter of the <HI>civil Government (materia circa quam)</HI> are men and women, as members of the <HI>common-wealth,</HI> without, as well as with|in the <HI>church:</HI> but as <HI>christians</HI> and <HI>members</HI> of the <HI>church,</HI> they are not such; 1 <HI>cor.</HI> 5. 13. The formal causes of both are distinct; the one inflicts <HI>punishments</HI> meerly <HI>spiritual;</HI> the other inflicts <HI>punishments</HI> meerly <HI>civil.</HI> Lastly, the end of this, is the <HI>corporal</HI> and <HI>external</HI> good of a <HI>society;</HI> but the end of that, is the <HI>spiritual good of the church</HI> and its <HI>edification; Matth.</HI> 14. 15. 1 <HI>cor.</HI> 5. 5. 2 <HI>cor.</HI> 10. 8.</P>
<P><HI>Do not likewise the</HI> Socinians, Anabaptists, Quakers, <HI>many</HI> Independents, <HI>and others err, who maintain, that the key of Doctrine, or the publick preaching of the Word, is proper to any man furnished with sutable gifts, though not cal|led, and sent to that employment?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, no man can believe in Christ of whom he hath not heard, and how shal he hear without a Preacher; and how shal he preach unless he be sent; <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 14, 15. (2) Because, Women may have sutable, and
<PB N="310" REF="173">
competent gifts for Preaching, and yet they are forbidden to speak in the Church; 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 2. 12. (3) Because, the Scripture blames such, as have run, and yet have not been sent; <HI>Ierem.</HI> 23. 21, 32. (4) Because, no man taketh this honour to himself (that is, he ought not to take it) but he that is called of GOD, as was <HI>Aaron; Heb.</HI> 5. 4. (5) Because, the Scripture mentioneth, <HI>that GOD hath set apart certain peculiar Ministers, for the preaching of the Word; Rom.</HI> 1. 1. <HI>Ephes:</HI> 4. 11. <HI>Titus</HI> 1. 3. (6) Because, no man can take the office of a <HI>civil Magistrate,</HI> or of a <HI>Deacon</HI> of the <HI>church</HI> upon him, unless he be called thereunto; <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 14. <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 5. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 10. And therefore no man ought to take upon him the <HI>publick preaching of the Word,</HI> unless he be called thereunto likewise. (7) Because, he that taketh upon him this office, without a call, he <HI>usurpeth Authority</HI> in the <HI>church,</HI> seing Preaching is an <HI>Act of Authori|ty;</HI> 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 12. (8) Because, the Titles which are given to the Preachers of the Gos|pel, are names of Office; they are called the <HI>Ambassadours of Christ;</HI> 2 <HI>cor.</HI> 5. 20. <HI>Stewards of the Word; Titus</HI> 1. 7. <HI>The Men of GOD;</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6. 11. and <HI>Angels; Rev.</HI> 2. 1. (9) Because, there is not one approven example, in all the <HI>Word of GOD,</HI> for a <HI>gifted brother</HI> to Preach
<PB N="311" REF="173">
without a <HI>call;</HI> and therefore seing it is not done in Faith, it must be Sin. Must every Fellow that takes a <HI>laxit</HI> in his tongue, go up to the Pulpit and ease himself? (10) Be|cause, there are Precepts and Rules set down in Scripture, for all the <HI>Ages of the church,</HI> to the end of the <HI>world,</HI> anent the calling of men to be Ministers of the Gospel; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 2, 3, 6, 7. and 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 21, 22.</P>
<P><HI>Do not likewise the</HI> Independents, Brunists, <HI>and</HI> Anabaptists <HI>err, who maintain, that the Right and Power of Governing the church, belongs no less to the multitude and community of Believers, than to the Officers of the church?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Scripture expresly teaches, that GOD hath committed the Govern|ment of his church, and the care of his peo|ple, to certain chosen Persons, and not to all, and every one; <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4. 11. 12, 13. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 28. (2) Because, if the power of the keyes were given to believers, in com|mon; either they are given to them as believers, or as they are gifted by GOD, with gifts, and qualifications above others, for Governing the church, and chosen out of the rest, for performing that office. If
<PB N="312" REF="174">
the last part be affirmed, it follows, that the power, and right of the keyes, is committed not to a community of believers, but to some select persons, which we own, and maintain: but the <HI>Independents deny.</HI> If the first be asserted, then it follows first, that the care of <HI>Governing the church</HI> is committed to <HI>Women,</HI> and <HI>children,</HI> being believers; and so they must necessarly have the power of <HI>seeing,</HI> as being <HI>eyes,</HI> and <HI>watch men</HI> to the church: the power of <HI>hearing,</HI> as being the <HI>ears</HI> of the church: and the body of the church must be deformed; because the whole body is the <HI>eye,</HI> and the whole body is the <HI>ear,</HI> and whose many members are made one member; 1 <HI>cor.</HI> 12. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. (2) It follows, that the power of the keyes, it not only given to all, but to Believers only: but it is evident by the ex|ample of <HI>Iudas,</HI> and other <HI>Reprobates,</HI> that many in Christs name have preached, who were not Believers; <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. 22, 23. <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 16, 17, 18. (3) Because, to whom Christ has given the power of <HI>Governing the church;</HI> to them also, he hath promised to give gifts, and enduments largely for performing that office; <HI>Iohn</HI> 20. 21, 22, 23. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 6, 7. <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19, 20. But to a <HI>community</HI> of <HI>Believers,</HI> God has never promised a <HI>Spirit</HI>
<PB N="313" REF="174">
for the <HI>Ministry,</HI> nor gifts for that <HI>employment.</HI> Nor did he ever bestow, or <HI>confer</HI> any such <HI>enduments.</HI> (4) Because, Christ our <HI>Media|tor,</HI> appointed <HI>Ecclesiastical Officers</HI> and <HI>Church-Governours,</HI> before ever there was a <HI>formal church,</HI> under the <HI>New Testament</HI> gathered, and set up; <HI>Luke</HI> 9. 1. <HI>Luke</HI> 10. 1, 2, 3. <HI>Iohn</HI> 20. 21, 22, 23. <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19, 20. This was all done before <HI>his death.</HI> And before <HI>his ascension</HI> he did the like; <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4. 8. 11, 12. <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 28. Now it is evident, that there was no <HI>formal gathering together</HI> of a <HI>church,</HI> before the <HI>Feast</HI> of <HI>Pentecost; Acts</HI> 2. <HI>Ecclesiastick Ministers,</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> were ap|pointed for <HI>calling in,</HI> and <HI>gathering together</HI> the <HI>Mystical body of Christ,</HI> to wit, his <HI>Members:</HI> therefore it was needful, that <HI>Ministers bap|tizing,</HI> ought to be before <HI>Persons baptized.</HI> That <HI>Gatherers</HI> of the <HI>church</HI> ought to be be|fore <HI>Persons gathered.</HI> That <HI>callers</HI> and <HI>inviters</HI> to <HI>Christ,</HI> ought to be before <HI>Persons called</HI> and <HI>invited.</HI> (5) This <HI>Democracy</HI> or <HI>popular Govern|ment,</HI> cannot but bring in <HI>great confusion,</HI> whence many absurdities will follow. As the <HI>church of GOD</HI> should not be an <HI>organical body.</HI> That <HI>Women</HI> who are forbidden to speak in the <HI>church,</HI> most have the <HI>keyes of the kingdom of Heaven hanging at their Belt, forsooth.</HI> All must <HI>govern,</HI> and none must be <HI>governed.</HI> All must

attend the <HI>government</HI> of the <HI>church.</HI> All must be rendred <HI>uncapable</HI> for going about their <HI>particular callings,</HI> which <HI>God calls</HI> them to eve|ry day. Therefore seing this sort <HI>of Government,</HI> brings so much <HI>confusion</HI> with it, it is most <HI>probable,</HI> that it is not <HI>of God</HI> who is a <HI>God of Order,</HI> and not <HI>of confusion;</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 33.</P>

<P><HI>ARE Church Censures necessary for reclaiming, and gaining of offending brethren; for deterring of others from the like offences; for purging out of that leaven, which might infect the whole lump, for vindicating the honour of Christ; and the holy profession of the Gos|pel, and for preventing the wrath of GOD, which might justly fall upon the church, if they should suffer his covenant, and the seals thereof to be pro|phaned by notorious and obstinate sinners?</HI></P>

<P>(1) Because, the <HI>power of the keyes,</HI> is gi|ven to the <HI>Ministers of the church,</HI> wherewith not only by the <HI>preaching of the Word,</HI> but also by <HI>church censures,</HI> they open and shut the <HI>kingdom</HI> of <HI>heaven;</HI> as will appear by comparing these places of Scripture together; <HI>Matth.</HI> 16. 19. <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 17.

<P><HI>OUght there to be such Assemblies for the Government and further edification of the Church, as are called Synods and Coun|cils?</HI></P>

<P><HI>Are the decrees and determinations of Councils, and Synods, if consonant to the Word of GOD, to be received with reverence, and submission, not only for their agreement with the Word, but also for their power, whereby they are made, as being</HI>

<P>Yes. <HI>Acts</HI> 15: 15, 19, 24, 27, 28, 29; 30, 31. <HI>Acts</HI> 16, 4. <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 17, 18, 19, 20:</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters">unists <HI>and</HI> Inde|pendents <HI>err, who maintain; that every particu|lar Congregation, or church hath in it self, the full power of church Government for exercising the whole power of the keyes, without subordination, or subjection to any Classical or Synodical Meeting: and that Presbytries, and Synods, have only a power of counselling, advising, and exhorting, but no power of Iurisdiction, to command or enjoyn any thing in the Lord, to particular churches or congregations?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the <HI>Apostolick church</HI> referred all weightier matters, which did equally con|cern many Congregations, to the free suffra|ges, and votes of the Apostles, Pastors, and select Brethren, and not to the determinati|on of any <HI>one particular church,</HI> or <HI>congregation; Acts</HI> 15. 23, 24, 25. <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 2, 3. (2) Because, it is evident from Scripture, that there have been many <HI>particular churches,</HI> and <HI>congregati|ons subordinate to one Presbytrie.</HI> For, in the <HI>church of Ierusalem,</HI> it is manifest, that there were more than <HI>one congregation.</HI> First, from
<PB N="318" REF="177">
the multitude of Believers, who were of a greater number than could be of one Con|gregation, <HI>for hearing the Word, and communi|cating; Acts</HI> 2. 41, 42. <HI>Acts</HI> 5. 14. <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <HI>Acts</HI> 21. 20. (3) From the multitude of <HI>Pastors,</HI> and <HI>Ministers,</HI> whose pains and labours many <HI>churches</HI> required; <HI>Acts</HI> 1: 12. 13, 14, 26. <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 1, 14, 37, 42. <HI>Acts</HI> 4: 31, 34, 35, 37. <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 2. <HI>Acts</HI> 8: 14: (4) From the diversity of <HI>Tongues among the Disciples</HI> at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which were given, not only for the edification of those that were of that Church; but also <HI>for signs and wonders to others,</HI> who were without, and not of that Church. (5) It is manifest from this, <HI>that in those dayes,</HI> they had no churches, or meet|ing houses built, <HI>but only met and conveened in private houses, and upper rooms.</HI></P>
<P>The same is also true of the church of <HI>Antioch, Ephesus,</HI> and <HI>Corinth,</HI> from the <HI>Acts of the Apostles;</HI> and other places of Scripture. But all these congregations were ruled and governed by one <HI>Colledge of Pastors.</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, all these particular Congre|gations, are called but one church; <HI>Acts</HI> 18: 22: <HI>Acts</HI> 12, 5: (2) Because, in that one church, there were church <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who were called <HI>Governours,</HI> not of any one particular congregation, but of the church, which was

made up of many <HI>particular churches; Acts</HI> 20. 17: <HI>Acts</HI> 15: 2: 3: <HI>Acts</HI> 13: 1, 2, 3: (3) Be|cause, these <HI>Presbyters</HI> did meet together for governing the <HI>church,</HI> and performed <HI>Acts of Iurisdiction,</HI> which concerned the whole <HI>church in common; Acts</HI> 11: 30: compared with chapter 4: 35, 37: And <HI>Acts</HI> 21: 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25: and <HI>Acts</HI> 13: 1, 2, 3: (4) Because, there is a <HI>particular example of a Synod,</HI> which had the <HI>power of Iurisdiction,</HI> and which consisted, and was made up of <HI>members,</HI> out of diverse <HI>Classical Conventions:</HI> For when the Question about <HI>circumcision,</HI> and the keeping of <HI>Moses Law,</HI> which troubled the <HI>Churches of Syria, Cilicia, Antioch, and Ierusalem,</HI> could not be <HI>determined</HI> in their own <HI>particular churches,</HI> the <HI>matter</HI> was <HI>referred</HI> to a <HI>Synod of Apostles</HI> and <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who met at <HI>Ie|rusalem, which decided the controversy, and appointed</HI> their <HI>decrees</HI> to be <HI>obligatory,</HI> and binding to all these foresaid <HI>churches; Acts</HI> 15. <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 4. <HI>Acts</HI> 21. 25.

<HI>church</HI> such a <HI>government,</HI> may be as great, if not greater in his <HI>church,</HI> under the <HI>New Te|stament</HI> than was then: and seeing the Lord has no less consulted the <HI>good of his church now,</HI> than he did of old; it follows, that there must be <HI>councils,</HI> no less under the <HI>New Testa|ment</HI> than under the <HI>old,</HI> to which, particular <HI>churches</HI> ought to be <HI>subordinate.</HI> (6) From the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> and <HI>right Reason:</HI> for the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> directs to a <HI>diversity of courts;</HI> namely, where there is any Rule or Govern|ment in a <HI>city</HI> or <HI>common-wealth,</HI> and orders the <HI>inferiour courts</HI> to be subordinate to the <HI>su|periour,</HI> the lesser to the greater, and Appeals to be made from them to the greater. And in bodies both <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Politick</HI> the <HI>parts</HI> ought to be subject to the <HI>whole,</HI> for the good of both. Besides there are, and will be very many <HI>Ec|clesiastick affairs</HI> which will concern many <HI>Con|gregations</HI> equally and alike, which cannot be determined by any one.

(3) Because, cases and difficulties may occur, more intang|led, and intricate, than can be settled and composed by the <HI>Governours</HI> of any one <HI>Con|gregation.</HI> (4) Seing particular <HI>Congregations</HI> which ly nigh one to another, ought to shun
<PB N="321" REF="178">
divisions, and differences, and to live in <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>unity,</HI> it follows manifestly, that there ought to be <HI>Synods or Councils,</HI> con|sisting of the <HI>Presbyters</HI> of many <HI>particular congregations,</HI> which ought to be <HI>subordinate,</HI> to these <HI>Councils,</HI> and <HI>Synods.</HI> (5) From Christs own precept, and command, <HI>Tell the Church; Matth.</HI> 18. 15, 16, 17. For if our <HI>blessed Lord</HI> appointed, that for a single bro|thers <HI>offence,</HI> (he trespassing against <HI>GOD,</HI> or his <HI>brother,</HI> for gaining of him, and re|moving the <HI>Scandal</HI>) he be brought before the <HI>church,</HI> it follows by <HI>consequence,</HI> that the same course ought to be taken, when any one <HI>particular Congregation,</HI> offends against another, and remains obstinate in their <HI>scandalous Opinion,</HI> and <HI>Practise.</HI> For our <HI>blessed Lord,</HI> hath sufficiently prescribed a <HI>Remedy</HI> in this place, for removing of all <HI>Scandals,</HI> and <HI>Offences,</HI> whether of one <HI>bro|ther</HI> against <HI>another,</HI> or of <HI>one Congregation</HI> a|gainst <HI>another.</HI> Nay, surely, since Christ hath consulted so much the conversion of one <HI>brother,</HI> that hath sinned, and gone astray; much more will he look to the good, and conversion of a <HI>whole Congregation.</HI> (6) Be|cause, any one single <HI>congregation,</HI> with one <HI>Pastor</HI> only, hath not the power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> an instance whereof cannot be given, either

from <HI>Precept,</HI> or <HI>Practise,</HI> in all the <HI>New Testa|ment.</HI> Nay, the <HI>Ordination</HI> of <HI>Ministers,</HI> in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> was alwayes performed by a <HI>Colledge of Pastors associate</HI> together; <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 6. <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 1, 2, 3. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 14.

<P>First, that the <HI>Prophets</HI> must be <HI>censured,</HI> and <HI>judged</HI> by way of <HI>authority,</HI> not by other <HI>Prophets,</HI> but by the <HI>multitude:</HI> and <HI>vulgar of the Congregation,</HI> which is contrary to 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 14. 32.</P>
<P>(2) That all the <HI>Councils,</HI> in the times of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> which were <HI>convocated</HI> upon ne|cessary occasions for <HI>matters</HI> which concern|ed many <HI>churches alike,</HI> were but <HI>during the time,</HI> and extraordinary, and so not <HI>oblig|ing succeeding churches,</HI> though the occasions, and causes, why these <HI>Councils</HI> were <HI>convocated</HI> then, are, and will be to the end of the world.

<P>Yes. <HI>Luke</HI> 16. 23, 24. <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 25. <HI>Iude</HI> 6, 7. verses. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3. 19.</P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the particular judgement of
<PB N="331" REF="183">
every single man, follows immediately his departure out of this life; <HI>Heb.</HI> 9 27. (2) Because, the soul of the <HI>rich Glutton,</HI> after it departed from his body, was tormented in the <HI>flames of Hell; Luke</HI> 16. 22. 23.

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>Quest. III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DOTH the Scripture acknowledge any other place than heaven and hell for souls departed from their bodies?</HI></P>
<P>No.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Papists <HI>err, who be|sides these two places, have devised other four.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First, a place called</HI> Limbus patrum, <HI>in which the Faithful, who died before Christs passion, have been shut up, as in a dark prison, under ground; and being without torment, and for the time wanting happiness, have been keeped closs there until Christs Resurrection and ascension into heaven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, a place called</HI> Limbus infantum,
<PB N="332" REF="184">
<HI>in which Infants which die without Baptism, suffer the eternal punishment, not of</HI> Sense, <HI>but of</HI> Loss.</P>
<P><HI>The third is a most pleasant</HI> Meadow, <HI>in which as in a Royal prison, the Souls that are in it, want happiness, yet suffer no punishment of</HI> Sense, <HI>ex|cept what ariseth from the delay of happiness, but only of</HI> Loss.</P>
<P><HI>This place seems to be the</HI> Elisian Fields, <HI>taken out of the sixth book of</HI> Virgils Aeneiods.</P>
<P><HI>The fourth place is called</HI> Purgatory, <HI>which is a middle place between heaven and hell, in which are the Saints, who have departed from this life, without making satisfaction by temporal punish|ments, for their</HI> venial sins, <HI>yet have gone thither for the guilt of their punishment, the fault whereof is pardoned in this life: that when they have satis|fied and are well purged from every spot and blemish, they may be admitted to that blessed Vision in seeing GOD for ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Do not (I say) the</HI> Papists <HI>err, who besides heaven and hell maintain other four places, for souls departed?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons do you confute</HI> Limbus patrum?</P>
<P>(1) Because, the Souls of the <HI>Faithful</HI> that departed before <HI>Christs passion,</HI> were made In|habitants of the same <HI>Heavenly Ierusalem,</HI> with
<PB N="333" REF="184">
the Angels; <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 22, 23. (2) Because, the Spirits and Souls of the <HI>Faithful</HI> that died before <HI>Christ suffered, returned to GOD</HI> who gave them; <HI>Eccl.</HI> 3. 21. (3) Because, the ver|tue of <HI>Christs sacrifice</HI> did no less extend it self to <HI>Believers</HI> under the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> than to <HI>Believers</HI> under the <HI>New; Rev.</HI> 13. 8. (4) From the example of <HI>Enoch,</HI> and of <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> which two before the <HI>passion of Christ,</HI> were seen upon the mount with him; <HI>Gen.</HI> 5. 24. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 2. 11. <HI>Luke</HI> 9. 30, 31. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 5.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons confute you</HI> Limbus Infantum?</P>
<P>(1) Because, the Covenant belongs to the <HI>Children of Believers</HI> though not <HI>baptised;</HI> in which Covenant, <HI>glory</HI> and <HI>life eternal</HI> are pro|mised; <HI>Acts</HI> 2: 39. (2) Because, Christ said, that the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven belonged to lit|tle children,</HI> though not <HI>baptised; Matth.</HI> 19. 14. (3) Because, the <HI>Infants</HI> of the <HI>Israelites</HI> dying before the eight day, were not shut up in <HI>Limbus Infantum,</HI> as the Adversaries them|selves confess. But the Nature and Essence of <HI>Baptism</HI> under the <HI>New Testament,</HI> and the Nature and Essence of <HI>Circumcision</HI> under the <HI>Old,</HI> are the same; <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 11, 12. (4) All the Arguments which are brought against the absolute necessity of <HI>Baptism,</HI> do clearly overturn this fiction of <HI>Limbus Infantum.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, There is no such place, as a <HI>most</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="185">
<HI>pleasant meadow,</HI> in which, as in a <HI>Senatorian prison,</HI> the Souls that are in it want Felicity; yet suffer no punishment of <HI>Sense.</HI> This was made evident in the First Question. Lastly, there is no such place as <HI>Purgatory.</HI> (1) Be|cause, there is no such thing as <HI>Venial sin,</HI> as it is explained by the <HI>Popish-church,</HI> upon which false Foundation, is built this fancy of <HI>Purga|tory; Rom.</HI> 6. 23. (2) Because, <HI>temporal pu|nishments</HI> do not extend themselves beyond this life; <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 18. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 17, 18. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 5. 10. For in this life onely, the Godly re|ceive their <HI>evil things,</HI> as the Wicked receive their <HI>good things; Luke</HI> 16. 25. (3) Because, after the fault is pardoned, there remains no pu|nishment to be undergone; <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. 22. <HI>Psalm</HI> 32. 1, 2. <HI>Micah</HI> 7. 19. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 1, 33. (4) Because, the Thief upon the Cross, that was converted, did not suffer afterwards any pu|nishment in <HI>Purgatory; Luke</HI> 23. 43. Neither could his death, and confession upon the Cross, be accounted a perfect satisfaction (as the Adversaries affirm) because he did ac|knowledge, he had <HI>received the due reward of his deeds; Luke</HI> 23. 41. He that suffers as a Murderer, or as a Thief, or as an evi doer, his punishment cannot be accounted a satisfaction; 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 4. 15. (5) Because, they that <HI>die in the Lord, rest from all their labours;</HI>
<PB N="335" REF="185">
<HI>Rev.</HI> 14. 13. (6) Because, Christs satisfa|ction for the sins of Believers, is most full, compleat, and perfect, and doth not need our imperfect satisfactions, whether for the Fault or the Punishment; <HI>Isaiah</HI> 53. chapter; <HI>Titus</HI> 2. 14. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 1: 7: <HI>Heb:</HI> 10: 14: <HI>Col.</HI> 1: 20, 21, 22. Neither by our sufferings in <HI>Purgatory,</HI> is <HI>Christs satisfaction applyed to us.</HI> First, be|cause our sufferings there cannot be an <HI>in|strument for applying Christs Merits to us.</HI> For on GODS part, we have the Word, Sacraments, and the Spirit as means, for applying <HI>his me|rits</HI> to us. On our part we have <HI>Faith.</HI> Was it ever heard of in the <HI>Word of GOD,</HI> that the Lord made use of <HI>exquisite torments for applying his Grace?</HI> To apply Mercy by the execut|ing of Justice: Is forgiving debt, applyed by exacting the debt?

(3) Because, the <HI>Apostle sayes,</HI> being accused before <HI>Tertullus,</HI> there shall be a Resurrection of the dead, both of the Just and Unjust; <HI>Acts</HI> 24. 15. (4) Because, according to the <HI>Enochs</HI> Prophesy,
<PB N="339" REF="187">
the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints, to execute Judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them; <HI>Iude</HI> verses 14, 15. (5) Because, many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth, shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame, and everlasting con|tempt; <HI>Daniel</HI> 12. 2.</P>

<HEAD>Question.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SHal the wicked who know not GOD, and obey not the Gospel of Iesus Christ, be casten into everla|sting torments, and be punished with everlasting de|struction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power?</HI></P>
<P>Yes. <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. 31, to the end; <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 22, 23. <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 19. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1. 7, 8, 9.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>do not the</HI> Socinians <HI>err, who de|fining eternal death to be the extinguishing of the Body and Soul, maintain, that the wicked are to suffer no torment in hell; and that their whole pu|nishment</HI>
<PB N="340" REF="188">
<HI>will be to be deprived of Eternity, or</HI> ani|hilated, <HI>that is, both Soul and Body turned into</HI> NOTHING?</P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Do not likewise the</HI> Origenists, <HI>and some</HI> Ana|baptists <HI>err, who think, that not only the wicked, but the Devils themselves, after many torments in hell, shall be received by GOD into favour, and be made blessed and happy?</HI></P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P><HI>By what reasons are they confuted?</HI></P>
<P>(1) Because, the Apostle affirms, almost in so many words, that which we have asserted; 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1. 7, 8, 9, 10. (2) Because, Life E|ternal, and Death Eternal, are in Scripture opposed to one another in the same sense; <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. 46. But Life Eternal in Scripture, is not taken for being simply Eternal, but for being Eternally happy, or to be in a blessed Eter|nal state and condition; <HI>Psalm</HI> 133. 3. There|fore, Eternal death must be taken in Scrip|ture not for <HI>anihilation,</HI> or being turned into <HI>Nothing;</HI> but for an Eternal wretched and mi|serable state and condition. (3) Because, the <HI>Scripture saves,</HI> but the children of the kingdom shall be casten into utter darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth; <HI>Matth.</HI> 8. 12, 13. (4) Because, the <HI>Scripture affirms expresly,</HI> that the wicked are tormen|ted
<PB N="341" REF="188">
in hell; <HI>Luke</HI> 16. 24. Next, there are some degrees of torments there, but there are no degrees in <HI>non esse,</HI> that is, in <HI>not to be.</HI> (5) Be|cause, <HI>Abraham saves expresly,</HI> there can no man pass from the place of torment, to the place of bless and happiness; <HI>Luke</HI> 16. 26. (6) Be|cause, the torments of the wicked are called a Worm that dieth not; a fire that cannot be extinguished. (7) Because, the <HI>Scripture sayes,</HI> that the smoke of their torment ascen|deth up for ever and ever; <HI>Rev.</HI> 14: 11. <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. 3. (8) Because, the wicked will be car|ried into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels; <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. 46. And the same wicked, are to rise again to shame, and everlasting contempt; <HI>Daniel</HI> 12. 2. And to suffer the vengeance of Everlasting fire; <HI>Iude verse</HI> 7. And now only is the accepted time, and now is the day of Salvation; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 2.</P>
