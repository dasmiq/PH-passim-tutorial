leauing his Kingdome, his Queen,

<P>O loue! excelling all loue, and that in a King, which the

of whose eternall fame, fame dare not lye.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Maro</HI> cease to commend his Troiane <HI>Aeneas:</HI> let

disguised himselfe like a woman, lest hee should goe from

Queen, Crownes, or Kingdome, could keepe him from
great <HI>Britan:</HI> where his Maiestie may of right more reioyce

is now againe like the Eagle renewed and reuiued, to be by
Gods goodnesse continued as long by the second <HI>Brutus,</HI>
that babes in cradles may say, <HI>Iubilate Britanni.</HI></P>
<P>Much beholden we are to God, if we forget not God, and
great cause haue we to loue, and to honour his Highnesse in
great <HI>Britane:</HI> if we looke but vnto the greatnesse of his

and not heare of it, or be dumbe, and not speak of it, heauen
and earth would accuse vs of too much ingratitude, wood
and stones should condemne vs of too much forgetfulnesse.</P>
<P>Sith neither <HI>Syracusa,</HI> with their conuoyes and proui|sion

more louing to <HI>Scipio</HI> the Romane Consul, than
<HI>Christianus</HI> King of Denmarke, was to <HI>Iames</HI> King of
great Britane, whom neither heauens, earth, nor seas, nei|ther

from his loue, to come from <HI>Denmark</HI> as a crowned starre

cannot allow but eight onely of the like loue, but not eight
Kings, most seldome two. For to see a King out of his king|dome,

<P>Among such, what needs such leagues, and couenants
to dippe our weapons in blood, as the Scythians did? or die
our clothes in blood, as the Armenians did? or to drinke
blood out of our armes, as the Medians and Lydians did?</P>
<P>Sith the league between great <HI>Britane</HI> and <HI>Denmarke</HI>
is consecrated with inward blood of mutuall hearts, and
confirmed with the entrals and bowels of naturall Parents,
that two Sunnes may be sooner found to agree in the skie,

<P>This God hath appointed, nature confirmed, fates al|lowed,
and fortune thereto agreed.</P>

<P>I will therefore conclude with an Epilogue of
<PB N="7" REF="8">
the new Testament, of women that farre excel|led
men in faith, in constancie, and in seruice of
the Lord.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Women more zea|lous than men.</NOTE> I will omit to speake of <HI>Marie Magda|len,
Ioanna</HI> the wife of <HI>Chusa, Herods</HI> Steward, of
<HI>Susanna,</HI> with many other such women, which
ministred to the Lord, as he trauailed to preach.
I need not make mention of <HI>Anna,</HI> who prophe|sied
of Christ to the people, receiuing Christ in
her armes at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> confessed (as <HI>Simeon</HI> did)
the redemption of <HI>Israel;</HI> but euen of <HI>Pilates</HI> wife,

this only woma~ endeuored to perswade her hus|band
<HI>Pilate,</HI> to wash his hands fro~ such a wicked
fact, affirming he was a just and a godly man.</P>
<P>I sieldome read of such faith in a man, as of
the woman, who desired but to touch the hem
of Christs garment, and to be healed thereby, as
she confessed, to whom Christ said, her faith had
made her whole.</P>
<P>Now hauing heard, that as women ministred
vnto Christ in his preaching, so women follow|ed
him to his death, and also attended him to his
graue;<NOTE PLACE="marg">More wo|men followed Christ, than men.</NOTE> and more women were at Christs death,
