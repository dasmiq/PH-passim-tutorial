But Christ himselfe, being truth it selfe, reprehends in our Text <HI>Thomas</HI> incredulitie, <HI>be not faithlesse, but faithfull:</HI> and therefore <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> 1.15.</NOTE> <HI>that which is crooked can none make strait.</HI> This fact then of <HI>Thomas</HI> is a fault, and it is amplified heere by three circumstances especially.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he was <HI>one of the twelue.</HI> Not to beleeue the resurrection of Christ is a sinne in an ordinary Christian, in a Disciple yet greater, but in an Apostle <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pontan.</HI></NOTE> so well in|structed, and so well beloued, it was greatest of all.</P>
<P N="2">2. For that hee gaue no credit to the report of his fel|low Disciples, although his Master had often said, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk</HI> 10.16.</NOTE> <HI>hee that despiseth you, despiseth mee.</HI> Moreouer, they were the <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iansen.</HI></NOTE> greater part of the companie, tenne against one, and each of those tenne had receiued afore the Holy Ghost, Ver. 22. and concerning the present businesse, had heard and seene more then he, Ver. 20.21.</P>
<P N="3">3. For that hee did vent his incredulous thought in such a bold and peremptorie stile; <HI>except I see in his hands the print of the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> nay that is not enough, except I feele the print, <HI>except I put my finger into the print of the nailes,</HI> euery one being so bigge as my finger: <HI>except I

<P>Thus much of the fault. I proceed now to the faith of <HI>Thomas.</HI> And heere the Doctors haue moued a double doubt.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether <HI>Thomas</HI> did touch the wounds of Christ or no.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether his speech, <HI>my Lord and my God,</HI> were an exclamation, or an acclamation.</P>
<P>For the first, it is thought by <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Eub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m. sus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b.

Secondly, for that it is probable that <HI>Thomas</HI> hearing his masters voice, and seeing his countenance was abundantly satisfied with|out any further enquirie.

<P><PB REF="23">For the second arguments, albeit happily <HI>Thomas</HI> at the very sight of his master instantly became satisfied in himselfe: yet that euery scruple might be remoued out of his and our minde, our blessed Sauiour suffered his glorious bodie to be touched, as <HI>S. Iohn</HI> in his <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ca.</HI> 1.<HI>ver.</HI> 1.</NOTE> first Epi|stle, <HI>That which was from the beginning, which wee haue heard, which we haue seene with our eies, which we haue loo|ked vpon, and our hands haue handled of the word of life.</HI></P>
<P>Yea but Christ said in this Chapter at the 17. verse to <HI>Mary Magdalene, Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father:</HI> is it likely that <HI>Thomas</HI> obtained more fa|uour then <HI>Mary</HI> so dearely beloued of the Lord? Di|uines answer this obiection diuersly: First, our Sauiour did not forbid all touching simply, but <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Caluin.</HI></NOTE> immoderate embracing only: for <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> and other holy women with her touched his feet, Matth 28.9. <HI>They tooke him by the feet, and worshipped him.</HI> It is plaine then that <HI>Mary</HI> was suffered to touch and onely forbidden when she did it too much. Secondly, <HI>Mary</HI> beleeued the resurrection of Christ, and <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Marlorat.</HI></NOTE> therefore had no such need to touch him as <HI>Thomas</HI> had. Thirdly, Christ did inti|mate that his body being now glorified, he was not any longer to be respected carnally, but onely to be touched <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aretius.</HI></NOTE> spiritually with the finger of faith; according to that of <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Coloss.</HI> 3.1.</NOTE> <HI>Paul, If ye be risen with Christ, set your affections on things which are aboue, not on things which are on the earth.</HI> And lastly, there is an euasion in the text, <HI>Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father, but goe to my bre|thren, and say to them,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bectarmin. de sacr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment.

This expos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion is proper and pertinent and therfore notwithstanding the
<PB REF="24">
former obiections, I conclude, if not demonstratiuely, yet probably, that <HI>Thomas</HI> did actually touch Christs wounds according to Christs words, <HI>bring thy finger hi|ther, and see mine hands, and reach hither thine hand, and thrust it into my side.</HI></P>
<P>The next <HI>q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere</HI> to be discussed, is whether the words of <HI>Thomas (my Lord and my God)</HI> are an exclamation, or an acclamation. <HI>Arius</HI> and his brood, who denie Christ to be very God of very God, make them an exclamation, as if <HI>Thomas</HI> should haue said; O Lord God, what is it that I touch and see I not an acclamation or acknow|ledgement that Christ is the Lord God. Answere is made: first, that the text hath not any note of exclama|tion, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which is prefixed to the two Greeke words. Secondly, <HI>Thomas</HI> acknowledged something which he did not afore beleeue, but he knew before th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Father was God: and therefore this speech of his concerned God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Sonne. Lastly, Christ commended his faith in confessing the sonne to be the Lord, <HI>Thomas, because thou h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st seene me, thou hast beleeued:</HI> hee did re|prehend <HI>Thomas</HI> for the manner, but yet approoue him for the matter of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beleefe. So that the words <HI>(my Lord and my God)</HI> are a plaine confession of <HI>Didymus</HI> his faith touching Iesus Christ the Sauiour of the world. He saith not, thou art my Lord and my God: but, as if he had not time enough to put in Creed enough, hee brake foorth into this abrupt and impe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fect speech, as being of <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cal.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a.

<P>For the further examination whereof, obserue first his knowledge, then his application, the which are the two principall parts, of faith. As for his knowledge, <HI>Thomas</HI> confessed here not only that Christ is a Lord and a God, for there be <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.5.</NOTE> many Gods and many Lords in <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Euthym, in Psal.</HI> 49.</NOTE> opinion, analogie, title <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. us &amp; Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s apud Mall.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></NOTE> But to distinguish Christ from all these kindes of Lords and Gods, he doth affirme that he is <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<PB REF="24">
<HI>the Lord and the God,</HI> that is, the Lord of Lords, and God of Gods, Psal. 50.1. Here then is a preg|nant text against vnbeleeuing <HI>Iewes,</HI> and misbeleeuing <HI>Arians.</HI> If Christ had not been very God of very God, euen one substance with the Father, he would haue con|demned, and not commended this confession of <HI>Thomas.</HI> If any shall aske why <HI>Thomas</HI> is not content with one word, but vseth two, Lord and God: and why first hee calls Christ Lord, and then God? <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ferus ser.</HI> 1. <HI>in lot.</HI></NOTE> Answere may be, that he called him <HI>Lord,</HI> in that he conquered hell and death: and <HI>God,</HI> in that hee knew the very secrets of his heart. For when Christ had said, put thy finger hither, and see mine hands, and reach foorth thine hand, and put it into my side; <HI>Thomas</HI> instantly remembring what hee had fondly thought, and foolishly said, confesseth his fault in confessing his faith, <HI>my Lord and my God.</HI> The Disciples vsually termed him <HI>Lord</HI> in his life, to signifie therefore that it was the same Christ, hee first according to his ac|customed manner calleth him <HI>Lord,</HI> and then after hee proceedes further then he was wont, and calleth him al|so <HI>God.</HI> In the word <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Theophylact. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lord</HI> acknowledging his humani|tie, in the word <HI>God</HI> his diuinitie.

<P>Secondly, this doctrine <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Perkins on the Creed, art.

For if hee had not fully satisfied for them all, if there had re|mained one little sinne only, for which he had made no satisfaction, he could not haue risen againe: for death and the graue, which came into the world by sinne, and are daily strengthened by sinne, would haue held him in bondage.

<P>As for points of faith appertaining to thy selfe more neerely, the resurrection of Christ is a demonstration of our resurrection, according to that of Paul, <HI>If it be prea|ched that Christ is risen againe from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?</HI> 1.

Moreouer, the resurrection of Christ is a proofe of our iustification before God, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 4.25.</NOTE> <HI>he was deliuered for our offences, and raised againe for our iustification.</HI> As in his death he stood in our place, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Esay</HI> 53 5.</NOTE> <HI>wounded for our trans|gressing, and broken for our iniquities, and</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.25.</NOTE> <HI>bearing our sinnes in his body on the tree</HI>: so likewise in his resurrection, he is not to be considered as a priuate, but as a publike person representing the whole Church, making his righteous|nesse a cloke to couer all our vnrighteousnesse. If death could not keepe Christ fettered in his prison, it is eui|dent that his power was ouercome. Now then if death be conquered, it followeth necessarily, that sinne the <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23.</NOTE> wages of death is also destroied. If death and sinne be vanquished, then the tyrannous kingdome of Satan is subdued, who had the power of death, and was author of sinne, and ruler of hell. So that euery true Christian may reioice with Paul; <HI>O death, where is thy sting?

<P>THE whole world in old time was distinguished by three principall languages (as it appeares in <HI>Pilates</HI> inscription or title <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 19.20.</NOTE> written on Christs Crosse) <HI>Latine, Greeke, Hebrew.</HI> The Latine tongue was famous in re|gard of the <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gorran. pro|em.</HI> 2. <HI>in epist.

<L>Seruorum serut nunc tibi sunt domini.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Greeke tongue was especially regarded, because <HI>Greece</HI> was the worlds Vniuersitie, the seat of Wisdome, the mint of Arts, and as it were the common Nurserie of all humane learning. In which respect <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Archititre|mius apud Munster. cosm.</HI></NOTE> one commen|ding <HI>Paris</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> called it <HI>Graeca libris,</HI> and

<P>The Hebrew most honoured, in that it is Gods owne language, wherein his owne law was written, and where|with it was expounded vnto his owne people. Now <HI>Paul</HI> preached sermons, and penned Epistles in all these languages, as being a <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 9.15.</NOTE> chosen vessell of the Lord, to beare his name <HI>before the Gentiles, and Kings, and children of Israel.</HI> He preached and wrote to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> and so he did beare Christs name <HI>before Kings,</HI> for they were Lords of the world.

<P>The second difference betweene the two Testaments is, that God in the one spake <HI>many waies and diuersly,</HI> ei|ther by Angel, or by the Cloud, or betweene the Che|rubins, or by visions, or by dreames, after sundry kindes of speech, and diuers kindes of actions: but the doctrine of the other is taught after one sort, euen by preaching of the Gospell; <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 1.16.</NOTE> which is the power of God vnto salua|tion to euery one that beleeueth, and it worketh more mightily then all those kinds of reuelations, and pierceth into he heart of man more deepely then any manner of perswasion; yea though one should rise from the dead and seeke to vs.</P>
<P>The third dissent is, that God in old time spake only <HI>to the Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</HI> vnto some few men, and one nation. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 147.19</NOTE> <HI>He shewed his word vnto Iacob

<P>The fourth difference betweene the two Testam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts is, that God in the one, spake <HI>by Prophets</HI> his seruants: in the other, <HI>by Christ</HI> his owne sonne, by meere men in times past vnto the fathers: but vnto vs hee hath spo|ken by that eternall word which is God, <HI>whom hee hath made heire of all things, by whom also hee hath made the world, &amp;c.</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aretius.</HI></NOTE> The maine proposition of this chapter is that Christ who reuealed the Gospell is the sonne of God, yea, God himselfe.

</LIST></P>
<P>I haue spoken enough of the first description in my notes vpon the Gospell on Christmas day: the pith of it is, that Christ Iesus eternally God, in the fulnesse of time made man, is our only mediator and aduocate with God the Father; insomuch as our <HI>fellowship with God</HI> in this world, and <HI>fulnesse of ioy</HI> in the next, is attained by fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h alone first apprehending, and after applying his merits. Here then our Apostle commends the doctrine of the Gospell in three respects especially.</P>
<P>First, in regard of the subiect, as being most ancient and excellent, euen that <HI>which was in the beginning</HI> God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB REF="49" MS="y">
owne sonne, <HI>the word of life,</HI> yea <HI>that eternall life which was with the father afore all worlds.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, in regard of the certainty, <HI>that which wee haue heard, which we haue seen with our eyes, which we haue looked vpon, and our hands haue handled: declare wee vnto you.</HI> For Christ who was in the beginning that eternall word with the Father, in these <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b.</HI> 1.2.</NOTE> last daies <HI>appeared vnto vs.</HI> And as <HI>S.</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> expounds <HI>S. Iohn, he was manifested in the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh:</HI> Or as <HI>S. Iohn</HI> in his <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 14.</NOTE> Gospell expounds him|selfe, <HI>hee became flesh, and dwelt among vs.</HI> And <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aretius.</HI></NOTE> so wee haue seene and heard him <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aquin.</HI></NOTE> immediatly speaking in the world, as well as mediately, speaking in his word. For he spake to the Fathers by the mouth of all his Pro|phets euer since the beginning: but in our daies he hath <HI>spoken</HI> with his owne mouth vnto vs: our eares haue heard him in his Sermons, our eyes haue seene him in acting of his miracles, our hands haue touched his pre|tious body both afore his death, and after his resurrecti|on; and so that which wee so <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Erasmus.</HI></NOTE> many waies assuredly know to be true, <HI>declare we vnto you.</HI> For albeit the word of life being very God of very God, is neither visible nor palpable: yet in respect of the <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Marlorat. Piscator.</HI></NOTE> personall vnion of the two natures in him, it may be safely said againe and againe <HI>that which we haue seen and heard.</HI> And <HI>we saw the glory of it as the glory of the onely begotten sonne of the Father full of grace and truth.</HI> Iohn 1.14. And in this sense the word of life, yea the Lord of life is said <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 3 15. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.8.</NOTE> elsewhere to be killed and crucified.</P>
<P>Thirdly, in regard of the profit, because Christ is <HI>the word of life,</HI> not onely <HI>formaliter,</HI> in respect of himselfe: but in respect of vs <HI>effectiue,</HI> being authour of our natu|rall life, <HI>for in him we liue, and mooue, and haue our being.</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t. 17.28.

<P>The Gospell of Christ is a proclamation in writing common to all, and the Preacher is the <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> 1.23.</NOTE> voice of a cry|er, euen the mouth of God to giue notice to the peo|ple, that the contents of the proclamation concerne them and euery one of them.

<P>Secondly, S. <HI>Paul</HI> heere giueth answere to this obie|ction. It is true that the men of Hierusalem and their rulers haue crucified the Lord of <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.8.</NOTE> glory; but it was out of their ignorance, <HI>because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the Prophets which are read euery Sabbath day.</HI> They killed him indeed, but heerein <HI>they fulfilled all the Scriptures that were written of him,</HI> especially that Scripture, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 118.22.</NOTE> <HI>the same stone which the builders refu|sed, is become the head stone of the corner.</HI> And lastly, though it be granted vnto you that the Sauiour Iesus (<HI>through whom is preached vnto you forgiuenesse of sins</HI>) had a death full of ignominy, for that <HI>hee was hanged on a tree:</HI> yet <HI>his rising againe from the dead the third day</HI> was exceeding glorious, in that <HI>hee</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.8.</NOTE> <HI>lead captiuity cap|tiue,</HI> triumphing ouer death, hell, and the graue.

<P>SAint <HI>Paul</HI> doth especially <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> two things in all his E|pistles. 1. treate, 2. entreate. Hauing sufficiently trea|ted in the former Chapters of doctrinals, he commeth in this present to morals; entreating his Ephesians in ge|nerall, <HI>to walke worthy of the vocation whereunto they were called:</HI> in more particular, <HI>to support one another thorough loue, keeping the vnity of the spirit in the bond of peace:</HI> pressing this one point with arguments of <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI></NOTE> two sorts.</P>
<P>The first (of which epist. 17. Sund. after, Trin.) is taken from such things as are common vnto the whole Church, as being in all the faithfull one and the same, <HI>there is one body, and one spirit, and one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptisme, one God and father of all, which is aboue all, and through a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and in you all.</HI> As if he should argue thus, if the Church your mother bee but one, God your father but one, Christ your Lord but one, the holy spirit your comforter but one, if ye haue but one hope, one faith, one baptisme: I see no cause why ye should not liue together and loue together as all one, labouring to keepe the vnity of the spirit in the bond of peace.</P>
<P>The second, (contained in our present text.) is taken from such graces as are in <HI>euery one diuerse,</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aretius. Marlorat.</HI></NOTE> shewing that this inequality of gifts is not an hindrance, but ra|ther a furtherance to vnitie: for asmuch as all of them are giuen by the same author for the same end.

<P>In the whole 4. points are to be consi|dered espe|cially.</P>

</LIST>
<P>Concerning the first: in that our Apostle doth auowe here that the diuersity of grace bestowed on the Church is <HI>the gift of Christ,</HI> whereas he saith elsewhere that <HI>God the father ordained Apostles, and Prophets, and teachers, and that the spirit worketh ad these things, vnto euery one seuerally distributing as he will</HI>: we may learne two con|clusions in diuinity. 1. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en. in loc.</HI></NOTE> That all the workes of the sa|cred Trinity <HI>quoad extra</HI> without it selfe&punc; are common and communicable to euery person of the three. 2.

(as <HI>Nouelists</HI> acknowledge) <HI>Paul</HI> in this place maketh a perfite platforme of a Church, and a full rehearsall of all offices therein contained, and he saith expresly that Christ ascending vp on high gaue them for the gathe|ring together of the Saints, and for the worke of the mi|nistry, &amp;c. <HI>tell we all come to the vnity of the faith, and knowledge of the sonne of God, vnto a perfect man, vnto the measure of the full age of Christ.</HI> That is, as <HI>Caluin, Zanchius,</HI> and <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aretius. Beza.</HI></NOTE> other, vntill wee meet in that other world to come.</P>
<P>I know there were certaine things in the blessed Apo|stles which were proper vnto themselues, as their imme|diate calling from God, the power of working miracles and their commission to goe into the whole world, &amp;c. but to preach the Gospell of Christ in places where need requireth (although it be not peculiarly commit|ted to them) or to gouerne the Churches already plan|ted: I see no cause why it should not be perpetuall a|mong the Ministers of the word.</P>
<P>Likewise the function of an <HI>Euangelist,</HI> if it be taken for the writing of the Gospel, it was temporal and hath his ende. But if it be taken for preaching to the people plainely and simply, as <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>In loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bullinger</HI> thinketh: or gene|rally for preaching the Gospell: as <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Loc. com. tit. de verbi mi|nistris.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Musculus</HI> supposeth, in which sense <HI>Paul</HI> said vnto <HI>Timothie, do the worke of an Euangelist:</HI> or for preaching more zealously then o|ther, as <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>In loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bucer</HI> imagineth; I make no doubt but that it still remaineth in the Church.</P>
<P>Moreouer, <HI>Prophets</HI> if they bee taken for such as our Apostle meaneth in his <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 12.6. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.4. <HI>&amp;</HI> 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.1.</NOTE> Epistles often, I say for such as haue an especiall gift in interpreting the Scripture, whe|ther in vnfolding the deepe mysteries thereof vnto the learned, or in expounding the plaine sense thereof vnto the people: then it must of necessity be granted that they be perpetuall officers in the Church as <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Doctors.</HI></P>
<P>Saint <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Com. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ambrose</HI> therefore construeth our text thus,
<PB REF="130" MS="y">
<HI>Apostles</HI> are Bishops, <HI>Prophets</HI> are Interpretours of the Scriptures, <HI>Euangelists</HI> are Deacons. And <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>In verbi Pauli</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.2. <HI>inter opuscula Hyperij pag.</HI> 671.</NOTE> <HI>Hyperius</HI> saith that God will alwayes haue these degrees in the Church, and <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> in his Commentaries vpon the 12. to the Romanes is of opinion, that our Apostle describeth in that place such gifts as are necessarie for the Church at all times, among which hee mentioneth (as a chiefe one) <HI>prophesying.</HI> To be short, <HI>Bullinger</HI> vp|on this text obserues that the words <HI>Apostle, Prophet, Euangelist,</HI> are confounded: and the Pastors of <HI>Zurich,</HI> in the latter confession of <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>See harmon. consess. sect.</HI> 11. <HI>pag.</HI> 336.</NOTE> <HI>Heluetia</HI> chap. 18. write thus, <HI>the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nisters of the new testament are termed by diuerse names, for they be called Apostles, Prophets, Euangelists, Bishops, Elders, Pastors and Doctors.</HI></P>
<P>And here <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Zanchius.

And whereas the <HI>Rhemists</HI> reply that <HI>Bishops, Elders, &amp; Dea|cons</HI> are not mentioned in this catalogue: <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>Hence then obserue. 1.

<ITEM>time of Christs ascension.</ITEM>
<ITEM>manner of Christs ascension.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The place from whence Christ ascended (as we may collect out of this Chapter at the 12. verse) was <HI>the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of Oliues neere</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 24.50.</NOTE> <HI>Bethanie, containing a Sabbath dayes to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry from Ierusalem.</HI> Hee did ascend from a mount; an open, high, eminent place, <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></NOTE> that he might as sure the certaine truth of his ascension. If hee should haue withdrawne himselfe in secret, happily the disci|ples would haue doubted of his ascension, as they did a while of his resurrection: but now beholding him open|ly, publiquely mounting from a mount they could not but affirme it themselues, and confirme it vnto other.</P>
<P>2. Christ ascended from a mount, rather then from a valley, from an high place rather then from a low: for that it was one step vnto his iournies ende, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

heauen as he could on earth, &amp; then being on a mount, and so not able by naturall helpe to goe higher, <HI>a cloud receiued him out of their sight.</HI></P>
<P>3. It may be Christ ascended from a mount, for that he desired to stay so long, and to spend so many houres as he conueniently could in instructing his followers before he departed. Hereby demonstrating his excee|ding great loue to the disciples in particular, as also to the whole Church in generall, as you shall heare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur|ther in the discussing of the circumstances of time when Christ ascended.</P>
<P>The mount from whence hee did ascend was <HI>the mount of Oliues,</HI> and it was the <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 24.39.</NOTE> same place from whence he went to be crucified. One place serued to be a passage both to his crosse and to his crowne, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Perkins expos.

Lazarus</HI> on the contrary was an obscure base creature, full of sorrowes in his soule, and sores in his body, there was his shadow: but when he died hee was conueyed by glorious Angels into the bosome of blessed <HI>Abraham,</HI> there was his light and glory. It is an hard and almost impossible thing (saith <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Consolat. ad lulian. tom. 1. sol.</HI> 208.</NOTE> <HI>Hierome</HI>) that any should passe from great pleasures in this world to the greatest pleasures in the next, <HI>vt quis hic ventrem, &amp; ibi mentem impleat, vt de delicys transeat ad delicias.</HI>

his kingdome. Now looke what care Christ at his as|cension had ouer his Church, the same must euery Ma|ster haue ouer his houshold, and euery Minister ouer his cure, when it shall please God to take them out of this world.

<P>Happily some will obiect how Christ elsewhere pro|mised he would neuer leaue his Church, <HI>I am alway with you till the end of the world,</HI> Matth. 28.10.
