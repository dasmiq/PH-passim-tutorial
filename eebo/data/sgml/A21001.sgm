<P>_NEITHER Seas nor Mountaines are so impassable a diuision in humain society, as diuersity of language: they seperate our
<PB REF="3">
bodies onely, these our mindes, making vs absent euen in pre|sence, while though our bodies meet together, yet wee, (I meane our diuiner parts) cannot: If any one could open the backe doore of the Indies, and let vs in a neerer way, how would fame dwell on his memory, and poste|rity gratifie his labour. A sin|ceere cleere Translator dooth more, for hee conducts our vn|derstandings the next safest way to the ritchest intellectuall mines that are. How many after a long trauaile, bring forth onely some forraine deformitie, their exam|ple making deeper impressions then their precepts, where as these Bees bring vs home the
<PB REF="3">
honey, leauing the poyson in the weede, saue vs the labour of tra|uaile, by transporting other countryes to vs, and not exiling vs to them, making remotest kingdomes as domestick and cheape as mapps, greatest Princes as familiar as bookes, and our farthest iourney but to Paules Church-yard. For they reconcile and new tune iarring man-kind, bringing back the harmony of speech from discord to vnisone. For as originall writers are the spring-heads of knowledge, so are these the conduit pipes bring|ing vs home what wee haue not strength or leysure to fetch abroad. The vnhappy difference is, that all waters are cleerd and
<PB REF="4">
purified by long conueyance, writings corrupted and thick|ned. How so nyce and delicate an apprehension will relish these, euent will tell mee. The Author can protect him-selfe (who is yet liuing, and famous for his singular learning and eloquence) and you mee, not by patronizing mine errors, but in correcting them. Some houres of melan|choly I haue bestowed on these Holy Meditations, with much satisfaction to my selfe, if so to you I will thinke it a very for|tunate idlenesse, and striue hereafter to present you with matter of some other subiect.

<P>_LAie not vpon me &ocirc; Lord the arme of thy seuere iudge|ment: It wold throw me like a torrent into the depth of death and eternall damnation. It would deuour mee like fier, and the remander of my body would fly away into ashes: what eye is able to endure, without perrishing for feare, the onely
<PB N="2" REF="6">
looke of thine angry counte|nance, when casting thine eye vpon us, thou percest the very bottome of our hearts, and dis|couerest the secrets of our im|pure consciences? our abhomi|nable sinnes will draw downe thy iust anger vpon our heads, and thy inkindeled wrath will throw vs head-long at once in|to the gulphe of paine, tor|ments and misery. Before then that thy fury doth arise against mee, and that thou commest with a iust disdaine to ouer|throw &amp; destroy me, harken vn|to the humble groning which my heart, possessed with feare, doth present vnto thee, and re|ceaue this weake and panting voyce which with tears, cryeth
<PB N="3" REF="6">
thus vnto thee.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mercy, mercy &ocirc; Lord, alas my God what dost thou? wilt thou make proofe of thy strength on my weakenesse? dost thou thinke that I present my selfe before thee to wrastle against thy power? it is thy cle|mency &ocirc; Lord which I run vnto. I place my selfe vnder thy wing to the end it may defend mee from the rigor of the co~demna|tio~ which I haue to much deser|ued. Looke then vpon me with a milder countenance, and see|ing that I haue in a time conue|nient called vpon thy goodnes, helpe me, &amp; deliuer me from so many euills which beseege me: for behold, my body doth languish: &amp; it seemeth vnto me
<PB N="4" REF="7">
that all my bones are bruzed and broken.</P>
<P N="3">3. And my poore body is not onely thus cruelly aflicted, but likewise my miserable soule is wholy dipped in sorrow: this soule, &ocirc; Lord, which did deter|mine with her voyce to glorifie the author of her life, is beaten downe, and desolate, without strength, and courage; and as the fearefull Doue hideth her selfe at the voyce of thunder in some little hollow place, euen so she perceauing thy fearefull indignation doth seeke out the most obscure darkenesse for re|treat. But vntill when my God, shall thine anger last?</P>
<P N="4">4 Come, come &ocirc; my God, and turne vpon mee that looke
<PB N="5" REF="7">
of pitty where-with thou canst blot out, not onely my sinnes, but those of the whole world. I feele my soule to sticke fast in a foule and deepe bogge of in|iquity: she sinketh, she stretch|eth out her hand vnto thee &ocirc; Lord: alasse draw her forth of it, &amp; bring her into the way of sal|uation. Saue her &ocirc; Lord, for she coniures thee by thine infinite goodnesse and vnspeakeable mercy. It is most true that she deserues it not, and ought not to hope for helpe from him, whome shee hath so carelesly forsaken, against whose honor she hath so wickedly conspired: The reward of her offence ought not to be mercy, but tor|ment and eternall death.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="6" REF="8">
5. But &ocirc; Lord who is it that in the middest of hell; in the bottomlese pit of death, shall sing thy praises, and sound forth thy name? there is the dwelling place of sorrow, there is no|thing heard but howlings, there is nothing seene but tor|ments, and thy prayse on the contrarie consisteth in the pub|lication of thy infinite meeke|nesse, goodnesse and mercy.</P>
<P N="6">6. And thenbehold on the one side humble penitence which intercedeth for me, and which hath sworne not to leaue mee vntill it hath reconciled me vn|to thee. And on the other, hum|ble praier which importunes thee for me, and hath sworne not to let thee rest till it hath
<PB N="7" REF="8">
reconciled me vnto thee. Alas &ocirc; Lord, thou hast so oftentimes seene my teares, and heard my lamentations. That I doe daily at the remembrance of mine of|fences wash my face with my teares, I cause my bed to swim in the water with streameth from mine eyes: what is it which com|mandeth mee to doe so? is it not &ocirc; Lord penitence which I religiously obserue?</P>
<P N="7">7. I looke downe-ward, and tremble with feare at the aspect of thine angry countenance. I doe patiently endure the re|bukes of mine enemies, and take their reproches in good worth, as the iust punishment of their offences. I walke in their sight with sackcloth,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
with ashes on my head, and confession in my mouth, I pros|trate my selfe at the feete of thine Altars; I make leane with scourges of affliction the flesh which deliuered ouer my body vnto sinne: but my torments serue for matter of laughter vn|to those that hate mee, who swarme about mee to traduce me by scoffes and derision.</P>
<P N="8">8. But now that thou doost shew mercy vnto me, I will bid them stand backe, stand backe &ocirc; yee children of iniquity, yee shall no more laugh at my mi|sery: the Lord hath heard my prayer, my teares haue ouer|come his wrath, and loe I enioy the frute of his holy fauor. The brightnesse of his goodnesse
<PB N="9" REF="9">
hath shined vpon me, and be|hold, the mists wherin my head was wrapped are on a sodaine scattered and vanished away.</P>
<P N="9">9. I had skarce opened my lips to inuoke his ayde; my heart did skarcely dispose it selfe to craue his pardon, when as I felt his grace to bee shed vpon me, to comfort and quic|ken my languishing soule, euen as an hot bath doth the mem|bers of a poore Pilgrime tired with trauell: oh incredible clemency! how comes it to passe O Lord that thou art so ready to forgiue? I ranne on to offend thee, and thou came'st flying to giue me par|don. I haue employed all the dayes of my life to seeeke both
<PB N="10" REF="10">
by sea and land matter for my ambition, auarice, and licenti|ousnes; and after that I had en|gulphed and lost my selfe in mine owne pleasures, thou pearced'st in a mome~t the hea|uens, and clowdes, and cam'st to deliuer me. So as now I triumphe ouer my sinne, which followes the tropheis of my pe|nitency, the which hath found fauour in thy fight. And in this manner my hope (which mine offences had almost smothered) is reuiued more then before, &amp; doth promise me not onely the Empires of the world, which houer where the Lord encli|neth them, but openeth the highest heauens vnto me, and assureth mee after an happie
<PB N="11" REF="10">
life in this world, the enioying of diuine immortallity. What shall then mine enemies doe now, when they shall see such felicity heaped vpon me? They shall blush for shame, and shall by greatly troubled in their mindes: they shall retire them|selues all confounded and as|tonished: For he whome they thought to destroy, is raised higher then euer he was. Alas they mocked mine ashes, they iested at my fasts, they flouted my teares, and whilest by absti|nence I tamed my flesh, the true enemy to my soule, they did swimme in worldly de|lights: but loe, the arme of God was ready to thunder on their insolency. &ocirc; my God,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
giue them leasure to perceaue the extreame danger wherein they are, and to begge from an high the onely remedy for their disease, and as for me, who feele my selfe purified from those fil|thinesses which compassed mee about, which feele my soule enflamed with the fire of thy charity, teach my lippes to set forth thy prayses, adresse my voyce to resound thy mercy, and direct mine affection to loue thee sincerely, and to esta|blish her cheefe happinesse, and highest felicity in the know|ledge of thy truth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="meditation">
<HEAD>Beati quorum, Psalme, 31.</HEAD>
<P>HOw happy my God are those, whose offences thou
<PB N="13" REF="11">
hast pardoned, and whose sinns thou hast buried in a tombe of forgetfulnesse. For, alas! what can become of him whom thou causest to endure the iust pu|nishment for his sinnes? an ar|mie of miseries enuirons him, pouerty assailes him, sicknesse afflicts him, famine oppresseth him, and death it selfe, which he thinketh to bee the hauen of this tempestuous nauigation, is the bottomlesse pit to draw him into eternall torments.</P>
<P N="2">2. Thrice and foure times happy then are they of whom God demandeth none account of their actions, but is satisfied so that they humble themselues before him, acknowledging their infirmity, and opening
<PB N="14" REF="12">
vnto him the depths of their hearts: For his mercy is to bee called vpon by true confession, and sincerity of conscience: hee that will be heard, must humble himselfe before him. As hee which goeth to a fountaine, puts downe the mouth of his vessell before hee can fill it with liqour, in like manner it be|hooueth him to cast himselfe down before his creator, which will draw and taste of the water of this sacred fountaine, from whence distilleth the humour, which alone can cleanse and purge our consciences.</P>
<P N="3">3. I did thinke sometimes, oh my God, to hide my faults from thee, &amp; haue said vnto my selfe; How can hee tell, or not, what I
<PB N="15" REF="12">
haue done? In this manner my sinne waxed old in my bones, and like the sores of a sick man, who is ashamed and dares not shew his disease to the surgeon; they doe increase and waxe worse, till the whole body per|rish: in like manner the sinnes which I haue hidden from thee, haue wholy infected me.</P>
<P N="4">4. But at the last thou hast in such sort, day and night, layde thy heauy hand vppon mee, and hast caused mee to taste so many kindes of misfortunes, betwixt which my soule liueth without rest, quelled with a con|tinual pricking in my conscie~ce which pierceth the very bottom of my heart, as I haue acknow|ledged my falt, the which I now
<PB N="16" REF="13">
carry in my hand. Take notice of it &ocirc; my GOD, but not in thine anger: for the streaming teares which haue quenched with weeping the light of mine eyes, ought likwise also to haue extinguished the heate of thy iust indignation. And then, am I not the worke of thine hands, and that which is more, the liuely image of thy diuinity? who is hee so transported with choller, which will breake in peeces the workmanship which hee hath so much delighted to polish and bring to perfection, because it is a little foule and slubberd? This image is loden with filthinesse I confesse, but is it not much better to clense &amp; burnish it then to destroy it
<PB N="17" REF="13">
and tread it vnder foote?</P>
<P N="5">5. Teach me then my God, what satisfaction I am to make, for I haue now discouered vnto thee all those faults which be|fore I did conceale. The feare which possessed me then, when I hid my selfe from thee, now when I lay my selfe open vnto thee, is turned into hope of fa|uor and pardon. And now I cast my selfe into thine armes, as my surest refuge, with the selfe same countenance, as the poore patient, who shewing his wound to the Surgeon, lookes attentiuely vpon him, and man|fully endureth the search and lancing, for the desire and hope which hee hath to bee healed. But that which giueth me most
<PB N="18" REF="14">
hope of health, is, that those vices wherein I delighted heer|tofore, doe now make mee a|fraide to behold them, as the meates where-with a man is stuffed in health doe after|wards make him sicke at the heart. That which made mee fierce, doth now make mee a|shamed, when I consider the danger of death, wherevnto my pride had exposed my poore soule. I thanke that day which first gaue mee the light to ac|knowledge my fault. I did on that day, my GOD, re|ceiue a singular testimony of thy goodnesse towards mee, let it please thee then, that the pleasure which I haue recey|ued in displeasing my selfe,
<PB N="19" REF="14">
may continue with me as long as that which I tooke in my vices: For if I can take as great contentment in my peni|tencie, as I haue taken in my sinne, my happinesse shall bee equall to that of thine Angels, and by my humilation before thee, I shall see my selfe exal|ted to the highest toppe of thy fauour.</P>
<P N="6">6. Who doubteth &ocirc; Lord that thou wilt not receiue mee to mercy? thou whose meeke|nesse and benignity, is not only vnspeakable but incomprehen|sible? I did no sooner thinke of returning vnto thee, but thou diddest meete mee. I did no sooner say that I would confesse my misdeeds; but thou
<PB N="20" REF="15">
diddest grant mee pardon. I did no sooner know what pu|nishment belonged to my sinne, but thou forgauest it. I tooke the roddes in hand to chastice my flesh, and thou tookest them from mee. To bee short, I thought that thou wouldest haue proclaimed war against mee, and thou offeredst mee a charitable reconciliati|on. Oh how much more ra|ther &ocirc; Lord doost thou pardon then punish? Can a good Fa|ther more louingly receiue his Childe which beggeth his pardon, then thou hast recei|ued mee, when I did cast my selfe at thy feete? Mine heart also leapeth for ioy, and boy|leth with an holy heat to praise
<PB N="21" REF="15">
thy name; it reioyceth in the fauor which thou hast shewed it, accusing none but it selfe for what is past, and cryeth out, it is I which willed it, it is I which haue done it, it is I which tooke pleasure therein: but my God was mercifull vnto mee,</P>
<P N="7">7. How could he haue refu|sed me his mercy, seeing Christ Iesus is my Aduocate, and thy Saints, whose prayer is so deere vnto him, haue prayed, doe pray, and will continually pray vnto him for mee? They are those who make intercessi|on for mee; who procure his fauour for mee; who implore his goodnesse, for in those prayers which they powre out for thy vniuersall Church
<PB N="22" REF="16">
I hope to haue my part? They haue need alas to intercede for mee, seeing that the impiety of my heart hath in such sort blinded mine vnderstanding by her euill thoughts, as my soule could not looke vp towards heauen, to lift vp her hand to him, who onely can and will saue it: what remained for mee more, but that those whom thou drawest neere to thy selfe, and whom thou hast receiued into the sacred consistory of thine eternity, should beseech thee to haue pitty vppon mee? Vpon me, who (a cheife enemy to my selfe) haue neuer, could, nor would haue prayed vnto thee for mine offence. I doe now then comfort my selfe,
<PB N="23" REF="16">
for that thou hast opened mine eyes to see the lothsomnesse of my conscience, for that thou hast mollified my heart to make true contrition to lodge therin. If it hath not beene so soone as it shold, it hath not at the least|wise beene so late, but thou hast vouchsafed to receiue mee as thou art wont to doe those who let slippe no time of re|pentance.</P>
<P N="8">8. For those which make haste to sinne, and do willingly neglect repentance, when they perceiue their faults, and haue meanes to doe it, deferring till their liues end, to craue thy mercy &amp; louing kindnesse, and to make a deluge of their eyes, they are in great danger
<PB N="24" REF="17">
of deceiuing themselues, and true repentance cannot after|wards enter into their hardned hearts; their sorrow will be like that of desperate people, and thy mercy prooue deafe to their too late repentance.</P>
<P N="9">9. But I runne in time to thee as vnto the refuge and end of my hopes, to my com|fort in tribulation which hath enuironed mee in the same manner as the feare of death sezeth vpon him that is appoin|ted to some shamefull punish|ment. Cause mee then now to taste the pleasure which that man feeleth in his heart who is freed from Irons, deliuered out of prison, and defended from the punishment, wherein his
<PB N="25" REF="17">
enemy hath a long time held him captiue. And on the con|trary, let the enemy of my soule blush for shame when hee shall perceiue mee so deuoutly to craue the assistance of my God, who with the onely twinckling of his eye, can deliuer me from the voluntary bondage which I vowed to damnable voluptu|ousnesse, at such time as I drank the sweet honney of delicious pleasures which it presented vn|to mee with a deceitfull hand in the loathsome cuppe of this world.</P>
<P N="10">10. Alas! when I call to minde the time that thou did|dest thus returne vnto mee, and when with that eye of mercy thou madest a signe vnto me of
<PB N="26" REF="18">
pardon mercy, and saluation, it seemeth vnto mee that I doe verily behold a cleere sunne|shine to arise amiddest the stormes and tempests of the sea, who by little and little per|ceiuing the clowdes bringeth back a cleere and calme season, and vniteth the raging waues of the water. Euery houre I seeme to vnderstand that sweet and gracious word, when thou diddest say; Feare no more, for behold my spirit shall direct thy pathes, and shall not lose the sight of thee, thou shalt walke now vnder his conduct, who bringeth in pure &amp; cleane soules into my glorious king|dome. So soone as I heard this word, I fixed mine eyes on
<PB N="27" REF="18">
my guide, like the attentiue Pilot on the shining starre that directeth the course of his Na|uigation. O God! how sweet shall that rest bee which I shall enioy, after that I haue walked in those wayes which thou hast taught mee; I which went astray out of the path which leadeth to thy holy Ta|bernacle? I was already en|tred into the thick forrest of this world, where such doe easily loose them selues, who to enioy tho pleasure and sweetnesse of the shades, doe flye from tho light of the day, which should direct them in their iourney: for soone dooth the fearfull face of night afright them, and deliuers them for a
<PB N="28" REF="19">
prey vnto wilde beasts that cruelly teare &amp; deuoure them. I did already wander in this Labyrinth, and I was hopelesse to get forth of it, but that thou diddest put the thred into my hand, which brought mee out of this dangerous prison.</P>
<P>Be hold I am now at liberty, to doe homage and seruice vnto that GOD which did deliuer mee, to present vnto him his image pure and vndefiled, and to acknowledge all those fa|uors, which it hath pleased him to bestow on mee, to proceed from his onely goodnesse. Hee hath not onely heard mee a|boue his other creatures, gi|uing mee the vse of diuine reason, but hee hath likewise
<PB N="29" REF="19">
among men lifted mee vp in|to a throne of honor and mag|nificence, so that there was nothing left to perfect my happinesse, but onely to bee able to know it: and after that I had forgotten my selfe he did enlighten me by his holy light, and gaue mee time and will to bewaile my life past, and to a|mend in time to come.</P>
<P N="11">11. Doe then like mee that are my friends, and haue re|course in time to his mercy, for he himselfe calleth you into the way of saluation: and bee not like to the stubborne Mule which kicketh against the spur, hee wanteth reason, knowledge and iudgement.</P>
<P N="12">12. For a bit is put into his
<PB N="30" REF="20">
mouth, and he doth continually feele the spurre in his side. In like manner, if at the first war|ning, which the Lord giues you, to returne into his wayes, you doe not obey his will, hee will raine vppon you showers of calamities, which will make you more miserable then mise|ry it selfe.</P>
<P N="13">13. You see the starres which twinckle in the firmament, the sand which lyeth on the Sea shoare, but neither hath the sea so much sand, nor the heauens so many starres, as there are pu|nishments prepared for the ob|stinate. Their miserie hangs ouer their head, misfortunes follow them at euery steppe, vntill they haue throwne them
<PB N="31" REF="20">
head-long into that gulph, the onely thought whereof is fearefull to all those which do remember it, whose easiest places of retreate are full of cryes, groanings, and lamen|tations: Where paine is with|out end, griese without re|medie, repentance without mercy, where death is im|mortall, the body liuing but to dye, and the soule to suffer; where the soule feeles nothing but her sinne, and the body but his punishment. On the contrary, those which couer themselues with the Lords fa|uour, which make his mercy their buckler, who haue no o|ther hope but in his goodnesse, who follow his comandements
<PB N="32" REF="21">
and are iealous of his will and pleasure, what felicitie is there but they may attaine to? what precious thing is there in hea|uen, but shall bee opened vnto them? They shall sitte side by side with their God, and beeing enuironed with glory, so much happinesse shall be heaped vp|on them, as the soule of man is not able to conceiue the least part thereof, much lesse can my barren tongue ex|presse it.</P>
<P N="14">14. I will then reioyce &ocirc; my God in the hope of such and so many benefits as thou re|seruest in heauen to crowne the iust withall. Vnto this ioy I inuite you all which trust to the wordes of our Sauiour,
<PB N="33" REF="21">
which loue iustice and righte|ousnesse, there doth the reward of your labours attend you, there you shall be placed in ho|nor and glory, there shall you exchange the sharpe thornes of this world, for flourishing Lillies of all eternity; Oh then shall the sweate of your afflicti|ons finde most sweete rest. Gold comes not forth of the flames in the Furnace more pure and shining to bee stam|ped with the Image of a great Prince, and then to serue for the adornment of some rich cabinet, as the hart of that man which loueth his God shall be drawne pure and cleane from the miseries of this world, to be inuironed with splendor and
<PB N="34" REF="22">
glory. What day can now dis|please mee in this world? who shall hinder and stay me from entring into the howse of the Lord, for to liue in his seruice? vpon what day of my life shall I ceasse from bewailing those sinnes which kept me forth of his fauor? vnite then in me, &ocirc; my God these two contrary passions, ioy and repentance, to the end that like as the pil|grim, who hath lost his way in a desert, reioyceth when hee beholds the dawning of the day, and yet for all that can|not forget the obscure darke|nesse out of the which hee is yet scarce come, nor lay aside his feare of so troublesome a night: euen so haue I alwayes
<PB N="35" REF="22">
abhorred my sinnes past, and haue neuerthelesse a certaine and liuely hope to enioy that eternall happinesse which thou hast purchased for vs by the price of the bloud of thy deere Sonne Iesus Christ. Alas! how great is this loue, when the Maister spareth not the life of his childe to redeeme his seruant? Beeing then for|med by thy hand, redeemed by thy bloud, and purified by thy mercy, I offer my selfe vnto thee for a sacrifice of obedience; reiect mee not &ocirc; my God.</P>

<P N="4">4. I looke round about mee, and as much as the eyes of my body and soule can discerne of the time past, I see nothing a|boue, beneath, nor on each side of me, but sinne which compas|seth me about, and mine ini|quites which crush and presse me downe: they are heaped vpon my head like an heauy

burthen, and behold, they smother me.</P>
<P N="5">5. How shall I resist them? what strength haue I to defend my selfe, seeing that my body falleth in peeces? corruption runnes from it on euery side: mysoares are no sooner shut, but they open againe, and if my body bee ill, my soule is much worsse, it is all confoun|ded and trembleth for feare.</P>
<P N="6">6. And as sicknesse vnder|mines my body, which is ready to die, euen so doth sorrow my soule, and steales away the strength thereof, and as a sharp cold doth freeze and wither the tender new bud in the blosome, euen so doth the finger of the Lord, which hath touched my

<P N="7">7. But Alasse my God! what courage can I haue, when I behold my selfe couered with wounds, and that there is no part of my body free from greefe, and that besides my disease, my licentious pleasures present them-selues before me, which reproch my sinne, and deride my vanity? I say to my selfe, must I needs dippe my life in the honney of so many delights, to steepe it afterwards in the gall of such bitter an|guish: where art thou now &ocirc; deceitful voluptuousnes, which diddest melt my soule in the sweere licour of thy pleasures? &ocirc; what a draught dost thou
<PB N="41" REF="25">
now leaue mee.</P>
<P N="8">8 Now &ocirc; Lord, haue I not endured enough? hath not my humility sufficiently chasticed my pride? if I haue sinned tho|row foolish presumption, I haue since then fallen vpon the ground and couered mine head with ashes; with mine owne arme I haue preuented my pu|nishment. I haue cleft my hart with cries, and melted mine eies into teares, and yet thy wrath continewes.</P>
<P N="9">9 It may be &ocirc; Lord that thou hast not perceued my laments; thou who in the twinckling of an eye lookest thorow heauen and earth, whose sight pearceth the very bottom of our hearts; &ocirc; LORD thou hast read my
<PB N="42" REF="26">
thoughts, and knowest mine in|tents what haue I craued but thy mercy? wherein did I hope but in thy goodnesse? where|fore haue I made a publicke profession of repentance, but to condemne my selfe? if my tongue hath not liuely expres|sed my desire, alasse Lord! thou knowest what wee would haue before we haue thought there|on. It is sufficient to lift vp our harts vnto thee, and forth|with thou grantest our peti|tions.</P>
<P N="10">10. But wherefore &ocirc; Lord dost thou delay to giue me the holy comfort which thou hast promised me? alasse, I am hable to do no more, my hart faileth me, my sences are troubled
<PB N="43" REF="26">
my strength forsaketh mee, my sight waxeth dimme, and my run away soule, is already vpon the brinkes of my lippes.</P>
<P N="11">11. All my friends stand about me, and doe already be|waile my death, they haue no hope of my health, they take care for my buriall, and questi|on with them-selues, where is the helpe he expected from his God? wher is the fauor which he promised to himselfe from him?</P>
<P N="12">12. Flatterers are departed from me, they did thinke to de|uide my spoiles, they would haue preuented my fatal houre, so troblesome am I to the whole world in the state wherin I sta~d.</P>
<P N="13">13. They rounded one ano|ther in the eare, and made a

<P N="14">14 And I, as if I had beene deafe, made as though I heard nothing, and like a dumbe man I answered not a word, my pati|ence was my buckler, and my constancy my rampier.</P>
<P N="15">15 Euery one that sawe me so patient in mine aduersity, did say, this man for a certaine is dumbe, when he is taunted hee replies not, could he indure all these indignities if any feeling of courage or reputation were

<P N="16">16. Wherefore I trusted in my God, and am assured that he will helpe me. Let the world bend it selfe against me, let hea|uen and earth conspire my downefall, so long as I haue his aide, I shall alwaies conquer. By the breath of his mouth hee created all things, and by his breath, if he please, he can des|troy them: I will fight vnder his banner and I am assured of vic|tory.</P>
<P N="17">17 I haue often-times saide vnto them, reioyce not at my misery, though I am tormented and afflicted, braue me not, for

the Lord is long enough to reach you: trust not to his long patience, for though hee hath feete of woll, his armes bee of Iron. If he once lift them ouer your heads, &ocirc; yee im|penitent soules, he will crush you in such sort, as there shal|bee no more remembrance of you.</P>
<P N="18">18. As for my selfe, I haue handled the rod, I haue imprin|ted vpon my shoulders the con|demnation of my sinne, I haue O Lord, appeared before thee with teares in mine eyes, repen|tance in my mouth, and sor|row in my heart, I haue fought with my selfe, for feare least myne enemies should triumph ouer me.</P>

I do not ceasse &ocirc; my God to admonish them, but they pay me euil for good, and turne into laughter all that which I doe to please thee, and to giue them good example: they doe slanderously traduce mee vp and downe the streets, and lay a thousand wickednesses to my charge: I confesse &ocirc; Lord that I beginne to loose my patience.</P>

<P N="18">18. But what is the cause &ocirc; Lord that thou hast so highly exalted the throne of thy glo|rie? Is it because thou wilt con|temne the humble prayers of thy faithfull seruants, and neg|lect the whole world, which is nothing in comparison of this thy greatnesse? Alas! not so my God: Thou hast lifted vp thy selfe in an eminent place, to the end that all the inha|bitants of the earth may see and acknowledge thee; to haue recourse to thy grace &amp; mercy,

In this man|ner &oacute; Lord dooest thou deli|uer those, which haue giuen them-selues ouer to the bon|dage of sinne: at the onely twinckling of thine eye their Irons shall fall from off theyr hands.</P>

<P N="23">23. I doe now already feele &ocirc; my God, that thou hast en|lightned my soule by thy grace, and hast shewed me the mercy which thou wilt offer to all the children of the earth, my spirit hath already seene from a farre off how readily thou walkest to deliuer the world, which was in danger of death before thine arriuall, that was the cause why thou heardest it cry out vnto thee, saying, tell me &ocirc; Lord the number of my yeares, and

<P N="25">25. In very deed &ocirc; Lord I know, that in the beginning thou diddest make heauen and

<P N="26">26. But all that, shall weare away, like an ouer-worne gar|ment, men shall seeke after and enquire what is become of it, but it shall bee no more found: it hath beene made, and it shal|be vndone, it had a beginning, and must needs haue an end; but thou alone &ocirc; Lord which art from all eternity shalt re|mayne for euer at one stay. Age, and time which consumes all things, doe but confirme thine essence, and publish thy diuinity, and it seemeth vnto me that men are borne vpon the earth to none other end, but

<P N="27">27. Men shift not shirts so often as one selfe-same land doth oftentimes change hir in|habitants, the one pusheth on another, and all is renued in a moment.

Yet notwithstanding &ocirc; Lord, that we must part hence, I doe not lose my hope to taste one day of the sweet fruite which will heale vs of this con|tagious disease, which our first parents haue communicated to vs by eating of the fruite of sinne and death.

<P N="3">3. If thou shouldest keepe a register of our offences, and shouldest call vs to an account, who were able &ocirc; my God to endure the rigour of thy iu|stice?

I confesse &ocirc; Lord, that in this contem|plation I remaine as though I were dull and blinde, not bee|ing able to pearce thorow this thick mist, which did dazell the eyes of mine vnderstanding. But at the last &ocirc; Father of
<PB N="124" REF="67">
light, thou hast opened mine eye liddes, and enlightning mee with the beames of thy wise|dom, thou hast made mee to vnderstand the reason thereof: and freeing mee from the tra|uaile and doubt wherein I was, thou hast filled mee with assu|rance of my saluation, and gi|uen me a most certaine conso|lation: so as now, I not onely neglect the threats of the wic|ked, and despise their insolen|cie, but beeing armed with an admirable constancy and great|nesse of courage, I of my selfe, doe vndertake the com|bate, and crye out with a lowd voyce: Happen what will, I now feare nothing. For al|though God for a while doe
<PB N="125" REF="67">
exercise his faithfull seruants, yet hee forsakes them not at their need, but doth in such sort mixe their aduersity with their strength, as they euer remaine victorious in this incounter. And indeed, so long as I shall put my trust and assurance in his mercy; what occasion shall I euer haue to feare?</P>
<P>Hee hath now taken my life into his protection, and co|uereth me on all sides with the wings of his power, who is able to enforce him to forsake mee? what shall I feare, if hee de|fend mee, whom all the world stands in feare and awe of: his forces are not armies of men, but legions of Angels, Princes and Captaines, are
<PB N="126" REF="68">
not his ministers, but lighte|nings and tempests: his displea|sures, are not stroakes and wounds, but earthquakes, swal|lowings vp of Citties, inunda|tions of Countries: Thou hast already &ocirc; Lord, taken all these weapons in hand, and art ready to thunder vpon the pride of the wicked, who haue conspi|red the destruction of good men. But because &ocirc; my God thy mercy doth for a while hold back the arme of thy di|uine vengeance, thou comfor|test mee in the meane time with a firme hope, that thou wilt neuer forsake mee: And I seeme dayly to heare thee, speaking thus vnto mee, Tar|rie yet a little while, the houre
<PB N="127" REF="68">
which I haue appointed is not yet come, and build thou in the meane time on my pro|mise, and what affliction so|euer is prepared for thee, as|sure thy selfe, I will make thee to ouer-come it. My courage &ocirc; LORD encreaseth, when I feele thee thus to second mee; and this thine exhortati|on doth more animate mee to patience, then thee applaudes of the people doe the wrast|ler in the middest of his game. Nothing dooth now any more astonish mee, all these practi|ses and conspiracies against my life and honour seeme like the tempestuous waues of the raging Sea, who roa|ring a farre off, come and
<PB N="128" REF="69">
breake them-selues against the foote of some rocke, they are scattered at the first shock, and the blow yeelds nothing but a vaine sound, which is the end of these great menaces: It is certaine, that the conscience of an innocent person, buil|ded vpon thy fauour, is stron|ger then the greatest rocks, and no furious assault is able to shake it.</P>
<P N="3">3. What shall I now feare any more? a sort of wicked people who compasse mee about, seeking meanes to sur|prize mee? they inuent sun|dry meanes to entrappe mee. Behold how they looke at one side, how they bend theyr browes and grinde their teeth
<PB N="129" REF="69">
at mee, I doe verily beleeue that their cheefest desire is to teare mee in peeces with their teeth, to glut themselues with my flesh, to gnaw my bones, and to drinke my bloud. O cruell beasts, how can yee thus change your natures, how can yee thus abiure all hu|manitie? Doe you thinke that because yee haue forgot|ten GOD, that GOD hath forgotten his seruants? Doe yee thinke that his seru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nts are as farre seperated from him, as your selues are from righteousnesse?</P>
<P N="4">4. And though like cruell Tygers yee haue shedde your poyson vppon mee, yee haue disquieted mee with your fear|full
<PB N="130" REF="70">
cryes, and torne mee in peeces with your teeth and talents, yet your stroakes haue none otherwise lighted on mee then on burnisht steele, they would not pearce mee, mine innocence is invulnera|ble, and at the last beeing ty|red and spent, yee are con|strained to make retreate, and lying flatte on your bellyes; yee barke and grinne in de|spight, but yee haue no more power, and yee haue none o|ther weapons left, but onely the will to doe euill. But be|cause your voyce is abhomi|nation before God, and that by your threatnings yee blas|pheme him, hee will wholy roote yee out, and throwe

downe those hills vppon you which your ambition and aua|rice haue heaped one vpon an other, thinking thereby to scale his throne, and to robbe him of his glory.</P>
<P N="5">5. O Lord! what sight hast thou presented to mine eyes? I am now so assured of thy mercy, so comforted by the care which I perceiue thou hast of thy faithfull seruants, as albeit I should see neuer so great an armie of men, yet I would not feare them. Let them bring against mee an Armie compo|sed of all the nations of the earth, let them place Scithy|ans on the right wing of the battaile, Aethiopians on the left, the East Indies and

America in the rereward, and place the rest of the world for the battaile in the middest, adde there-vnto what so-euer the arte of killing men is able to inuent, so as my GOD conduct mee, I will without feare passe thorow the mid|dest of them. And if hee bee|ing angry with the world, please to vse my hands to re|uenge him on their impiety, I will cut them all in peeces, so as not one of them shall re|maine aliue.</P>
<P N="6">6. No, I doe now reioyce, when I heare tell that the wicked bend them-selues a|gainst mee, and assure my selfe that it is GOD who pre|pares matter for my glory:

for &ocirc; my Lord, bee thou onely neere vnto me, and the victory is mine one, blesse my weapons, and mine enemies are con|founded.

As for my selfe, albeit I am couered with their wounds and defamed by their wrongs, yet I had ra|ther haue them to bee the sub|iect of thy mercy then of thy iustice, and I desire, if thou so please, that their vnrighteous|nesse

<P N="7">7. Thou knowest &ocirc; Lord my wishes, thou readest in my hart, how I neuer requested venge|ance at thy hands, my vowes do co~iure thy mercy; my thoughts tend onely vnto peace: wilt thou vnderstand the summe of my desires and the end of all my prayers? it is &ocirc; LORD, that I may spend my daies in thy faythfull ser|uice, that thou wilt make thine holy house my dwel|ling place, and that so long as I shall bee seperated from thee and from thyne Hea|uenly Tabernacle, beeing sta|ked downe to the earth by the

For there &ocirc; Lord thou art present with vs, and as much as thou canst thou drawest thy selfe downe from Heauen to remayne amongest vs, thou fillest vs with thy selfe to clense vs from sinne, and changest our carnall will into a quickning spirit, to make vs to feele thy wonders, to com|prehend thy mercies, and to conceiue thy power.</P>

8. Grant then &ocirc; my God, that being incorporated into thee, as much as mine infirmity, and thine infinitenesse will permit, I may bee illuminated with the beames of thy wisdome, to the end that shining in mine vnder|standing, it may cause mee to know thy will. For it is the thred &ocirc; Lord which is able to guid mee safely thorow the by|waies of this worldly labyrinth, it is the passeport whereby wee attaine to his eternall life, the which we daily sigh for.

For &ocirc; Lord seeing that thou hast shut me into thine holy tabernacle, shewing mee the sacred misteries of thy diui|nity: and that in the hardest time of mine aduersity, thou hast receaued, hidden, and reti|red me vnder thine Altar, and not content there-with, hast caused me to enter into the ho|ly of holies, and into the secre|test place of thy Tabernacle, where thou art wont to reueale thy most secret commande|ments; cause mee to conceiue them so directly, as I may bee able faithfully to deliuer them to thy faithfull seruants.</P>

<P N="11">11. As for my selfe &ocirc; Lord, I will indeuor reuerently to han|dle the ministery which thou hast committed to my charge, thou knowest how I haue car|ried my selfe therein; I haue tur|ned on all sides to know what

My cry then was mine offering, the which thou diddest ac|cept, opening the Heauens to entertaine and receiue it. I will then &ocirc; LORD all the

onely vnto thee with my heart, crying out vnto thee, saying, what &ocirc; Lord? I haue sought thee with so much carefullnes day and night, in peace and warre, in rest and torment. I haue desired nothing so much in this world, as to beehold thy face, not &ocirc; Lord the face of thy diuinity wherein that feare|full maiesty is imprinted, which shineth like lightning, and which humaine eyes are not able to beare, but at the least wise that face couered and vai|led with thy workes, the which albeit wee can behold it but be|hind, and that very obscurely, doth seeme most admirable vn|to me, and doth wholy rauish and draw me forth of my selfe.
<PB N="142" REF="76">
If then &ocirc; Lord, thou art this vn|created word which hath crea|ted all things, thy word which is a part of thy will, and thy will a part of the whole, doth it not represent thy counte|nance vnto me, wherein I be|hold many excellent markes of diuinity, which brightly shine on euery side? &ocirc; Lord I am amo|rous of this rare beauty, I haue none other care or thoght, but how to inioy this thy presence, which shews it self in thy word, as in the mirror of thy diuinity.</P>
<P N="14">14. Seing that thou perceiuest the sanctity and sincerity of my loue, depriue me not of this sacred obiect, which blesseth and sanctifieth my thoughts: if thou doest abhorre my sinne

and if the deformity therof doe displease thee, enter not into fury against me, neither turne away from mee this faire and admirable face of thine: Thy warth &ocirc; Lord, is onely vpon such as glory in their sinne, and wax stubborne in their iniquity.

Thou shalt not then reiect me, for thou must forth|with then reiect thy mercy wherevnto I am so strictly bound and tied, that as it is not to be seperated from thee, euen so can it not bee seauered from

<P N="15">15. If it please thee, then thou shalt dwell with me, and seeing it hath pleased thee to aduouch mee for thy seruant, and to put mee to this combat, thou shalt not forsake mee therein, other|wise my destruction would turne to thy shame, whereas my victorie will redound to thy glory. Now &ocirc; Lord cause this ayde to be continually with me. For, as mine owne infirmity doth ordinarily fight against mee, euen so is it needfull that my succour should euer bee at hand. If thou estrange thy selfe from mee neuer so little, my soule will vanish away, in the same maner as would my body, by the losse of my soule: For
<PB N="145" REF="77">
thou &ocirc; Lord art more the soule of my soule, then my soule is the life of my body. I do very well know, that in mee thou shalt finde a dwelling place, in no sort worthy thy diuine Ma|iestie, yet for all that, disdaine not to enter into mee; where thou commest, all magnifi|cence abounds, and where thou art, there is alwaies honor enough: Thou doest not &ocirc; Lord honor thy selfe by visi|ting me, but thou thereby doest honor vnto mee thy poore ser|uant, wherefore shouldest thou leaue the brightnesse of the heauens, and the glistering of the starres, to come downe here on earth to so dishonorable a subiect? But as I thinke thou
<PB N="146" REF="78">
dooest it to giue warning to thine Angels not to growe proud in their magnificence, in regarde they are thy creatures, and that thou art able to make the basest dweller vpon earth as glorious as they. That is the reason why thou descendest from heauen, to shew mercy vpon vs, and bearing a part in our misery, thou commest to re-establish vs in our ancient perfection. And because we, as much as in vs was, haue defa|ced the image of the diuinity, which thou hadst imprinted in vs, thou of thine especiall grace commest to renew those beau|ties and sparkes of our first nature. It is thou then which art not onely content to bee
<PB N="147" REF="78">
our Creator, but our redeemer likewise, and as thou art our father, in like manner it pleaseth thee to bee our protector and defender. When all the world forsooke vs, thou stretchedst out thine armes vnto vs, and diddest receiue vs vnder the wings of thy clemencie.</P>
<P N="16">16. I stood in great neede thereof, for I knew no more whether to goe. My father and mother had forsaken mee, that father I say, who had tenderly fed and brought mee vp did abhorre mee, when hee per|ceiued that I delighted wholy in thee, and that I had left the vanities of this world. They beheld mee with sorrow, and accounted mee for a lost child.
<PB N="148" REF="79">
The kinde embraces of my bre|theren were conuerted into disdaine, the sweet friendship of my sisters changed to con|tempt, and the louing wel|comes of my friends turned into derision. Whether now should I make retreate? If my deerest friends vse mee in this manner, what will mine ene|mies doe, whose mouth is all bitternesse and tongue poy|son, whose actions and ordina|ry exercises, are wrongs and re|proches? But when I am most of all forsaken, then art thou neerest vnto mee, then doest thou most fauourably embrace mee, and most liberally pow|rest vpon mine head the trea|sures of thy mercy.</P>

Learne mee thy law, and how to direct my paths, to walke alwayes aright in this narrow thornie way, which should conduct mee to the hauen of health. For &ocirc; Lord, I haue left long since that easie beaten way strewed with earthly pleasures, and which leadeth those that follow it to destruction and damnation. Shew mee then my God, thy way, for vnder such a guide I shall neuer goe astray, shew it I say, vnto me &ocirc; Lord, for if I stray neuer so little, I am vndone,

<P N="18">18. Giue mee not ouer then into their hands, to do with me after their hearts desire, for they would soone depriue mee both of life and honour. They haue already laide their plotte, inuented a thousand accusati|ons, practised a world of wit|nesses, but their lyes returne vppon themselues, and beare witnesse against them. False|hood cannot bee hidden, shee lyeth open, and truth pierceth it thorow on all sides. It is compounded of peeces ill ioy|ned

<P N="19">19. But if as they desir, they should heape slanders vpon me, and smother me vnder the bur|then of their wrongs, I would not for all that be discouraged. I haue not put my trust &oacute; Lord in the richesse and honours of this world, they are common|ly the portion of the wicked, they are for the most part the rewardes of their perfi|dious wickednesse and deceits: this marchandize is common|ly bought with none other money.

Other men looke for the fruite after the blossome, but I expect it after the fall of the leafe. After that the leafe of my bo|dy shall bee fallen, I hope that my soule shall flourish with new fruite, and shall bee cloa|thed with the eternall verdure of immortallity.</P>
<P N="20">20. Bee patient then my soule, and beare thy selfe vali|antly, redouble thy courage, and waite till my GOD come

Bee not asto|nisht at the prosperitie of the wicked, feare thou not though they doe oppresse good men: And because thou seest &oacute; Lord, that I am not strong enough of my selfe, assist and vnder|proppe mee, least that the af|fections of the wicked cause mee to remooue foorth of the place where thou diddest set mee; second my feruent zeale, to the end that hauing fought valiantly in the assault which the wicked make vppon mee, I may stand ready when thou shalt open the gate, and bee|ing entred in triumph with thee, I may sitte at thy feete at such time, when thou shalt iudge the quick and the dead.

<P N="9">9. On the contrary, hee
<PB N="167" REF="88">
doth not so to the rich world|lings, whose wealth he hath not blessed, for those men are needy in their riches, starued in theyr aboundance, their wealth melts into pouerty, their magnificence vanisheth away into smoake, and be|comes like to a riuer whose spring-head is damn'd vp, his channell remaines drie, his bankes lose their greenesse, and the trees planted thereon wi|ther and fade. But those which haue recourse vnto God and do not forsake him, who referre all to his honor, shall neuer want any good thing, because the fountaine of all goodnesse, which is the loue of GOD, springeth in the middest
<PB N="168" REF="89">
of their soules, and sheds it selfe abroad through all the parts of their body.</P>
<P N="10">10. Now in regard you see how much profit there is in fearing God, how his feare is that which reconciles vs vnto him, this reconciliation doth purchase vs his fauour, doth encrease our felicity, come vn|to me and I wil teach you to feare him, who like a good and mercifull father, doth ne|uer deny his mercy vnto him which acknowledgeth his sin, and is willing to returne into the way of well doing.</P>
<P N="11">11. Doe you desire to please him, by that meanes to liue in his fauour which is as much to say as to liue happily, and to
<PB N="169" REF="89">
passe your dayes in tranquillity of spirit, and plenty of al things necessary for this mortall life, and moreouer to walke apace in the way of this immortall life, which tarrieth for vs after our departure hence: In a word do yee desire his blessing, which is as much to say as a firme and certaine prosperity, which be|getteth in vs a spirituall ioy, which will keepe your heartes alwayes open to breath his ho|nour, and to vse, with conten|tation, the wealth which hee lends you in this world? In a few wordes I will shew yee the way. For I know wherein hee delighteth and which of our actions doe please him.</P>
<P N="12">12. The first thing that yee
<PB N="170" REF="90">
shall doe, bridle your tongue, that it vtter no wordes which may offend Gods honour, nor vse sharp and bitter speeches. Doe you see this little mem|ber, how nice and tender it is? yet neuerthelesse it is the helme of our life, which steereth and turneth our minds on the same side as it selfe is turned. For so soone once as it is filled with naughty and vitious speeches, it carrieth the passions of our heart, where they are concei|ued, vnto the depth of our vn|derstanding, and doth water it in such sort, as it forthwith looseth the forme and figure of reason which God hath in|spired into it, doe you not see how a little sparke of fire burnes
<PB N="171" REF="90">
downe a whole building? euen so the toung giues sin entry in|to vs, brings him in deafely and spreading his fire abroad in our soule, consumes in vs all matter of goodnesse. Let vs then com|mand our lippes to receiue no|thing but the bare and simple truth, and let lies and deceipt befor euer banished from vs. For if we shut vp the euill cogi|tations which may arise in our hearts, not giuing them any vent, they will in the end smo|ther themselues, like to a fire which hath no ayre.</P>
<P N="13">13. Let vs first of all then put farre from vs all deceipt and lying, for the true praise which God expecteth from vs, is, that we imitate him
<PB N="172" REF="91">
as much as our nature will per|mitte. Now hee is the God of truth and righteousnes, who can neither loue nor cherish vs, so long as lying, which is his contrary, shall dwell in vs. Se|condly wee must fly from all sinne whatsoeuer; to avoyde e|uill, is the beginning of well doing, and if God find vs emp|ty of euill meaning, hee will fill vs with good, and will teach vs what wee ought to wish and procure. Hee learneth vs that which wee ought chiefly to de|sire. It is peace which hee will haue vs to wish for, with all our hearts. Peace first with him, which is the heape of all good|nes, the which we cannot haue, vnles we yeeld him that obedi|ence
<PB N="173" REF="91">
which we owe him. Peace afterward amongst our selues, without which we cannot ob|taine his. For hee hath com|maunded vs to loue our neigh|bours as our selues, but if we, insteed thereof, breath foorth nothing but blood and rapine, what peace can wee haue with him, whose lawes and com|mandements wee breake? For warre and discord are the roots of vnrighteousnes, and are ab|hominable before God.</P>
<P N="14">14. His eye, which is this good and mercifull eye, doth not looke but vppon the iust: his light shines onely on them, his wonders are wrought in theyr behalfe; his eares are onely open to theyr pray|ers:
<PB N="174" REF="92">
and we may properly say, that his Iustice stands at his side which examineth the liues of such as present themselues be|fore him and doth recommend vnto him the prayers of those that are of an vpright heart.</P>
<P N="15">15. As for those who take de|light in doing euill, he doth looke vpon them, but it is with an eye kindled with fury, whose beames are like arrowes of paine and misery, which he shooteth into their soules, fil|ling them with feare and amaz|ment, with a thousand other mischeefs which he sends vnto them, as the earnest of eternall torment which attends them. He thinkes not on them but only how to root out their me|mory
<PB N="175" REF="92">
fro~ the face of the earth, and by his iustice to wash out the spots of their polution: for he hath a long time knowne their impenitent heart, which hath insolently neglected his holy mercy.</P>
<P N="16">16. The Iust haue not done so, for they returned vnto God in time, and crying after his cle|mency, they did at the last ob|taine it, they now inioy it as their portion, he hath drawne them foorth of all the troubles wherein they were plunged, &amp; hath couered them with his fauour as vnder a brazen wall, so as no violent euil whatsoeuer is able to pearce through it.</P>
<P N="17">17. Truly god is good &amp; fauou|rable he is alwaies neere to the
<PB N="176" REF="93">
afflicted which call vppon him, hee forsakes him not, neither day nor night, so soone as sor|row hath humbled vs, and cau|sed vs to know what neede wee haue of him, behold hee is at hand to saue vs.</P>
<P N="18">18. The righteous indeede are afflicted with strange cala|mities, and wee may in a maner say, that they are the subiect of misery, so many euills doe at once seeme to ouer-whelme them. But it is onely to make the mercy of God the more il|lustrious &amp; notable in their be|halfe: For the greater that their tribulation is, the brighter doth Gods pitty and compassion shine in their conseruation.</P>
<P N="19">19. Hee preserueth the least
<PB N="177" REF="93">
of their bones, yea, namely not an haire of their heads shall pe|rish or be pluckt off, but by his expresse will, and he neuer wils it, but for their good and salua|tion. More-ouer a! their wealth and store is vnder his protecti|on, and when hee pleaseth hee will multiply their riches, hee will make his blessings to florish in their houses, and hee will en|crease their wealth and possessi|ons aboue all enuy.</P>
<P N="20">20. On the contrary the life of the wicked shalbe miserable. If at the least-wise for to try the~, &amp; to inuite them to returne vn|to him, he doth lend the~ some wealth in this life, hard and la|mentable shall bee their death. Death, which shall turne them
<PB N="178" REF="94">
ouer to eternall torments; Death which shall plung them in the botomlesse pitte of fires vnquencheable, there to bee deuoured and neuer consu|med, there to bee euer lan|guishing and neuer dead, such shall bee the end of the wicked and of him which persecuteth the iust man.</P>
<P N="21">21. And thy poore seruants in the meane time, whom thou hast so deerely redeemed out of the hands of death and sinne, shall enioy in all happinesse the saluation which thou hast pur|chased for them, and holding death and sinne in bands vnder their feete in the chaines of thy mercy, they shal trust in thee so long as they shall remain in this
<PB N="179" REF="94">
worldly exile, &amp; after that they are come forth of it, they shall enioy that eternall blessednesse which thou hast promised them, beholding in thy coun|tenance, that fountaine of brightnes, goodnes and beau|ty, wherwith thou diddest cre|ate heauen, earth and al therein contained.</P>

<P>IN regard that Gods proui|dence which gouerneth the world, oweth a recompence to euery man according as hee hath deserued; I am sometimes amazed to see how those whose onely study is to do euill, do re|ceiue so many fauours in this life, and doe bath them-selues
<PB N="180" REF="95">
in so many kindes of pleasures. But as my heart begins to swell and to bee despited in it selfe, I feele (as it seemeth vnto me) the spirit of God which comes and toucheth me, and plucking me by the eare, it saith vnto me, soft and faire, soft and faire, thou poore wretch, thou losest thy selfe in this ouer-deepe and dangerous discourse: comfort thou thy selfe in mee, and en|uie not the good of the wic|ked, bee not iealous of those which worke iniquity.</P>
<P N="2">2. For that which thou think|est to bee their felicity, is but a vaine shaddow, a false and de|ceitfull image, which will bee lost betwixt their hands, &amp; will flie away when they shall thinke
<PB N="181" REF="95">
to hold it fast. As the hay, which is mowen downe, fades &amp; wi|thers in a moment, euen so in a moment shal the magnificence of the wicked lose his colour &amp; brightnesse. The herbes in a garden are not so soone withe|red, as thou shalt perceiue the riches of the wicked to fal away and perish. Hast thou not be|held the flower <HI>Emerocall,</HI> true beauty of a day, which flourish|eth with a crimson dye in the morning, keepeth his coulour all day long, and in the euening becomes so pale and withered, as though it had bin bitten with the frozen teeth of winter? The happinesse of the wicked, if a de|ceitfull smile of an apparent felicity, may be termed a happi|nesse,
<PB N="182" REF="96">
doth properly resemble that flower, for it is withered so sodainly, is changed in so short a time, and is transfor|med in such diuerse manner, as it is a wonder to behold it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Put then thy trust in God, and beleeue it, the insolence of the wicked shall neuer conti|nue, so long as the diuine iust|ice shall beare rule, and bee lik|wise assured, that the iust man shall neuer bee forsaken, what affliction so euer he be in. Dis|courage not thy selfe, but con|tinue in wel doing, for he which perseuers vnto the end shall be saued. Dwell in the land which thy God hath giuen thee, con|tent thy selfe with the graces which he hath giuen thee, and
<PB N="183" REF="96">
enter not into iudgment with him; For thou shalt find in the end that the riches of the wick|ed are but giuen them to keepe.</P>
<P N="4">4. Reioyce thou in the hope which thou hast in thy God, &amp; lay aside the melancholy which thou hatchest in thy soule, which like rust eats &amp; consumes thy heart. For when thy minde shall bee once purified, and thy thoughts lifted vp to thy Lord; he will accomplish all thy wish|es, &amp; will cause thee to enioy all that which y^u art able to desire.</P>
<P N="5">5. But do not present thy selfe before him with wauering, goe not vnto him with diffidence, do not hide thy thoughts, ope~ the very bottom of thy heart before him, &amp; discouer thy thoughts.
<PB N="184" REF="97">
For it is impossible to deceiue him, and it is dangerous to goe about it. He seeth and noteth all things, chiefly a double and vn|beleeuing heart, the which a|boue all things else hee detest|eth: but hee receiueth and em|braceth the poore man that is humbled, hee harkeneth to his prayer, and giues him before hand that which he ment to ask.</P>
<P N="6">6. Nothing is wanting, nei|ther wealth, nor honour vnto him which hath his fauour: if thou please him once, hee will cause the glory of thy righte|ousnesse to shine brighter then the day light, and the equity of thy iudgments to glister like the mid-daies sunne. For people on all sides shall be seene to come
<PB N="185" REF="97">
from thee, blessing thy house for a temple of iustice, praysing thy word for an oracle, and re|uerencing thee as the cause of their rest and liberty. Euery one shall exalt thine integrity, as the protector of good men, and sure defence of the afflicted. But the more honour and glory that thou receiuest, humble thy selfe so much the more vnder the hand of thy GOD, and acknowledge this good to come from him, and yeeld him homage. The homage which hee demandes of thee besides thy heart, is but thy mouth and hands, thy mouth to set foorth his praise, thy hands to serue him according to his comman|dements.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="186" REF="98">

Loe, this is that which the spirit of God told mee, I com|municate it to you my friends, and make yeepertakers of these holy aduertisements, to the end that if here-after you see any one to prosper in his af|faires, and yet to blaspheme in his life, yee should not bee of|fended thereat, nor be angry in your selues, though hee which worketh iniquity, do abound in all manner of wealth.</P>
<P N="8">8. Be quiet then in your minds, sweeten the sharpnesse which pricks and vexes you, and neuer go about to hurt him because of that. For the recompence of good men is nor only good for good, but good for euill.</P>
<P N="9">9. And those, who caried away
<PB N="187" REF="98">
with a fiery impatience, do pro|cure the hurt of others, &amp; who in stead of leauing vengeance to God vnto whom it belongs, will vsurpe it from him, they shall bee rooted out for euer: &amp; like insolent seruants which enterprize vpon their maisters authority, they shall be sharply and shamefully punished. But he which possesseth his soule in patience, and constantly wai|teth for Gods iudgement, God will praise and blesse his obedi|ence, and after that he hath pu|nished the wicked for their mis|chiefe, hee will confiscate their possessions, and make him mai|ster and owner thereof.</P>
<P N="10">10. Tarry yet a little, and yee shall see the sport, Hee

whom yee did see so magnifi|cent, which made so great pro|fit by his sinne; who by his naughty practizes had gathe|red together so much wealth, as he thought thereby to haue purchased an immortall name: he shall glide a way like a waue, where the water flowed with great surges, there shal be seene nothing but mudde and dirt: there shal not remaine so much as any signe of the place where he stood; he shall be no more remembred then the wind which blew a twelue-moneth past.</P>
<P N="11">11. And on the contrary, a good and righteous man, shall possesse his roome, shall be successor of his ritches, and shal
<PB N="189" REF="99">
raigne in safety on the earth, leauing his wealth in succession to his children, peace shal passe on to his by inheritance. Peace, a rich and wealthy in heritance, which giueth tast to all other benefits, without which all the other is but torment and a|fliction. Peace, more sweet then the sweetest oile and milke which hatcheth all kind of plea|sures in thy bosome, which cau|seth vertue to budde and flou|rish, and which no wrisheth, and ripeneth her holy fruites.</P>
<P N="12">12. Now this peace is the guift of God, and nothing can be|stow it vpon vs but his goodnes and nothing can procure his goodnesse, but the reformati|on of our wicked liues: for so
<PB N="190" REF="100">
so long as warr shall remaine in vs, and that sinne, which is the sinne of discord shall lodge with vs, wee cannot hope for peace and rest amongst our selues. But on the contrary, if wee can make peace with God, wee shall forth with haue it with men, and wee shall liue in a firme and quiet rest.</P>
<P N="13">13. I know well that there will alwayes be wicked people found, whose euill-will, will not cease till they dye; I know very well that they wil alwayes lie in waite to surprize good men &amp; to practize against them, they will grinde their teeth at them, &amp; gromble like roaring Lions, for their hatred is so extreame against the good, as when they
<PB N="191" REF="100">
see them they know not how to looke, and resemble beasts ra|ther then men.</P>
<P N="14">14. But God almighty who hath appointed that which hath bin, which shalbe, and is, whose ordonances are immou|able, doth mock such practises, &amp; laugheth at the vaine doings of those false miserable wret|ches, which beate the ayre and skirmish with the wind: he sees their end to come on faire and softly which shall beare them hence like a great whirle-wind.</P>
<P N="15">15. For whe~ they think them|selues to be maister &amp; to haue al in their own power, euen the~ shall they bee in most danger. You shal see these miserable si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">|ners with naked swords in hand
<PB N="192" REF="101">
to bend their bowes and to take their ayme, to hit the innocent. They will band themselues to|gether, they will put their peo|ple in order, place their am|bush, giue the watch-word, and ioyfull in their hearts they will say: we hold him, he cannot es|cape vs.</P>
<P N="16">16. They will come to slay the poore, needy and innocent per|son, and will make account to roote out all those whose harts and soules are vpright. For a|gainst such men they denounce warre, because they hinder the execution of their purposes, and for that their innocence is a continuall reproach vnto them.</P>
<P N="17">17. They had already set their
<PB N="193" REF="101">
knife to the throate of the in|nocent, they were fetching their stroake, they had shot off their arrowes, but loe! by a wonderfull accident, the point of their swordes was turned vp|on their owne brests, their ar|rowes fell vpon themselues, their bowes brake betwixt their fingers; And at last they slew one another, with their owne weapons. Thou hast rightly said &ocirc; Lord, that alwaies euill coun|celles ouerthrow the authors thereof, thou hast foretold that the wicked are taken in their owne snares, and that at the last they shal suffer the punishment which they prepared for others.</P>
<P N="18">18. It is not then &ocirc; Lord, pow|er, greatnes, and worldly au|thority,
<PB N="194" REF="102">
which make men hap|py, troopes and armies of men make them not safe and con|querors. For the small store which thou giuest vnto the iust man, who by his sincerity is re|conciled to thy fauour, is of more worth, then all the plenty and a fluence of the wicked: the little which a iust man hath, ri|seth like the leuen in the dough, his strength flourisheth like the branches of the Palme tree, for his vigour takes root in thee who art the depth of al strength and power.</P>
<P N="19">19. But on the contrary the arme of the sinner, how strong soeuer it be, shal be, broken, and his strength shall be troden vn|der foote: for it is but a vaine
<PB N="195" REF="102">
shew which swelleth like to the glasse in the furnace; it waxeth great by the breath of the workman, but the more it en|creaseth and shines, the more weake and brittle it becomes, so as a small knock breakes it all to pieces. But the iust man is like to the diamond, the more it is hammered, the brighter it is: Affliction takes only from the innocent man his vppermost filth and excrement, and the nakeder he is, the fairer and purer he ap|peares.</P>
<P N="20">20. In a word whatsoe|uer God sends, to good men, all is for theire good. Hee knoweth the life and dayes of all such people as are
<PB N="196" REF="103">
pure and cleane, and giueth them that which is needfull for them. Their happinesse is pre|pared from all eternity, and they shall eternally possesse it, not an earthly inheritance, but a heauenly, whose wealth is in|finite and eternall, an inheri|tance, which deuided amongst his children, shall neuerthelesse remaine whole &amp; entier, whose parts shall be as great as the whole. For it is this inheritance of glory, which enritching so many people, doth fill them all with eternall blessednesse, and remaineth euer one, and al|waies infinite.</P>
<P N="21">21. Now albeit that the hope of Gods seruants is not fixed on earth, yet neuerthelesse so
<PB N="197" REF="103">
long as they shall remaine in this world he will not suffer them to want that which is ne|cessary for the maintenance of this life. For when the euil time shall come, when as vengeance shal be poured vpon men, when the waters shall ouerflow their bankes, when tempests shall beare sway, and the hea|uens raigne downe fire, the iust shall be then at rest in the midst of the tempests, stand dry-foot in the time of shipwrack, and shall be safe in the middest of the flames. And namely when a fearefull famine shall come to deuour nations, Manna shall fall from heauen to feed them. For the wrath of God is only vpon the wicked, his anger is
<PB N="198" REF="104">
only kindled against them: As for the iust the neerer they seeme to danger, the neerer they are to safety.</P>
<P N="22">22. They are not like to Gods enemies, who are highly hono|red and exalted, to make their dounfal the more greiuous and shamefull; for nothing hath a great fal but that which is high|ly exalted. The ruines of tow|ers shiuer themselues in peices and fall to dust, the wicked doe worse, for when they once fetch their leape, they do not only fall away to dust but va|nish into smoake, and euapo|rate to nothing. Behold the cloudes which comes foorth of the thundring throate of a great Cannon; what a thick
<PB N="199" REF="104">
vapour it casteth foorth, how it seemes to fill the emptines of the vaste ayre, and to muste the sunne: but they are no sooner ascended, but they grow lesser, and so at the last consume away, so as not any token there of is at all to be seene.</P>
<P>Such is the greatnes of the wicked, which hath no matter but their sinne, no motion but theire vanity; it increaseth in an instant, and in a moment per|risheth. And all the labour they bestow in preseruing it, serueth to no vse or purpose at all.</P>
<P N="23">23. They borrow and pay not againe, all that they catch is their owne, and they leaue
<PB N="200" REF="105">
nothing for other men to carry away, neuerthelesse all his pro|ffits them nothing, for as the aboundance of meat doth not fatten him that is in a consump|tion, because the radical humor of his life is spent, eauen so the blessing of God which is the roote of all prosperity, declines from the wicked. The iust man on the contrary who is full of mercy and compassion, giueth largely of his goods, and distri|butes his money, and like a cur|rent of springing water neuer waxeth drye.</P>
<P N="24">24. It is a blessing promised to those which blesse the name of God, that they shall inherit the earth, that is, they shall hold the earth, as an inherita~ce
<PB N="201" REF="105">
by good title: albeit they are molested, yet they shall neuer be ouerthrowne; For they are Gods children, whom he hath created, and therefore they haue sufficient authority to hold it. But those which blas|pheme his name, are disinheri|ted of his fauour, and like vn|gratefull children, are depriued of their fathers inheritance, so, as bearing his curse they must of force perrish.</P>
<P N="25">25. For there is none other saluation in the world but to trust in God, and to commit ones selfe to his keeping. He directeth the wayes of the iust man, and gouernes his actions, so as they need not to be amen|ded. He stirres vp his will to
<PB N="202" REF="106">
godlines, and turnes a way his eies from the baits of sinne, he will bring him back from the lanes and bywayes of pleasure, into the road way of vertue, and cause him to walke in the paths of his commandements.</P>
<P N="26">26. It is a faire plaine way where there are no stumbling|blocks, all is smooth and euen. And if the wicked, or father of lies, holdes out their legges to giue the iust man a fall, thou &ocirc; Lord art neere vnto him to raise him vp againe, and not to suf|fer him to be broken in pei|ces. And with thy hand of mercy, that most soft and ten|der hand, thou liftest him vp againe on his feet.</P>
<P N="27">27. I haue beene young and
<PB N="203" REF="106">
now am olde, yet to my re|membrance, I neuer saw the iust man wholly forsaken of God, nor his children brought to begge their bread. It may be that sometimes some crosse may light on him for a triall of his constancy, and for a proofe of his vertue, yet it do's no more but passe by and shake him, not being of force to throw him downe.</P>
<P N="18">18. I haue seene such an one whoe all day long did no|thing but giue and lend, so as a man would haue thought that hee tooke delight in wasting his goodes, and yet neuerthelesse hee did still a|bound in substance more then before, he much resembled
<PB N="204" REF="107">
the Pipe of a Pumpe, which draweth vp water in casting it forth: the full in him could not endure the empty. The iust man giueth, good doth forthwith fill him, his posterity is neuer the poorer for his bounty, for the blessing of God causeth riches to spring in him, as the sunne doth the fruites of the earth, &amp; multiplies them a hundred for one.</P>
<P N="29">29. Seeing then that God is so good and bountifull, if yee loue his fauour, take care to please him, the way is, to turne away from euil, and to do good. God loues him which imitates him, for loue proceeds from re|semblance, his actions are to do good, it is his chiefest occupa|tion;
<PB N="205" REF="107">
He began this worke when he made the world, and is neuer weary of it. Let vs then doe like him, and so long as wee shall dwell in this world, where hee hath giuen vs meanes to serue to his glory, and the profit of our neighbour, let vs not neg|lect this occasion to discharge our duties one to another, and by that meanes obtaine his fa|uor, which is the richest trea|sure we can purchase.</P>
<P N="30">30. Nothing doth please him so much as Iustice, for thereby, as much as in vs lieth, wee pre|serue his workmanship and al|low his wise councell, in giuing to euery one that which is his owne, and distributed by the vniuersall lawe of the world,

which we call nature, and wee must thinke, that when wee iudge other men, we administer his power, and that such iudg|ment as wee giue, the like will he giue vs, when hee shall sit in his throne to iudge the world: not that hee can iudge amisse like vs, but he will make vs feele by his indgement the smart which wee haue procured to other men by ours. For hee will neuer forsake his Saints, hee will at the last gather them together, and will shield them from the in-iustice of men; he will of purpose sitte downe in his seate to iudge those which do oppresse them.</P>
<P N="31">31. There will he pronounce a rigorous iudgment against
<PB N="207" REF="108">
the vniust, and hee will destroy the wicked.

But these miserable wret|ches did not so, they willingly mounted the top from whence they fell into hell, they are now of the number of their fathers, they found their Ancestors there, from whom they drew their birth and manners; they imitated their vices, and after death they pertake their punish|ment. They learne, but too late,
<PB N="250" REF="130">
and when repentance is vnpro|fitable, what it is to lift them|selues vp against God, and to resist his glory. They learn what it is to afflict the iust, to oppresse the poore, to deride the afflic|ted. They are confined in dark|nesse, and the light shineth no more before their eyes. They heare nothing but horror and gnashing of teeth, they breath out nothing but sighs &amp; grones they do not moue vp and down, but in feare and ttembling.</P>
<P N="21">21. When these wretched mad|men were in honor, they knew not what it was, and became like beasts without vnderstanding. But alas, this is no true compa|rison, for when beasts die, death takes away their feeling of sor|row,

as well as that of pleasure: but these wretches, which wold not know wherein their happi|nesse consisted, who would not looke vpon eternall light, who stopped their eares at the spiri|tuall word, their feeling shall re|main for the subiect of their tor|me~ts, &amp; their soule shal liue per|petually to co~ceiue their misery and they shal for euer languish.</P>

Is not his prouidence saide to bee as great in the gouernment of the world as his goodnesse was wonderfull in the creation thereof?

<P N="13">13. And at the last I my selfe haue likewise said, my God how comes this to passe? I haue in vaine iustified myne hart, and ruled mine actions, according to thy commandements.

<P N="14">14. I haue done pennance, and haue all day long scourged my selfe, beating my hart with continuall sighes, peircing it with sharpe contrition, and haue driuen away by force of my bloudy teares that viscuous humor which had ouerflowed my will with ve|ry bitter gall. Euery morning

<P N="15">15. I said to my selfe, lo this is al I can say, those which feare God and serue him are aflicted, those which blaspheme him are at their ease. And therevpon I beganne to detest the conditi|on of those which glory &ocirc; Lord in being thy children, thy chosen, and went foreward and said.

what thy purpose was; and I peirced to the bottome of thy sanctuary, I entred as I thought into thy holy consistory, and there learn'd thy meaning heer|in. For after that I had resolued my selfe to wait the end which thou hast prepared for such people, I knew foorth with that thy iustice neuer lies, &amp; though it be somtimes long ere it come it recompenceth her slownesse by the rigor of the punishme~t.

<P N="18">18. Truly at the last thou didest pay them home; thou didest giue them the reward of their mischeefe and deceit. For when they thought themselues
<PB N="267" REF="138">
to be at the toppe of their greatnesse, loe, thou madest them leape downe into the pitte of misery. All their pompe and magnificence, all their ritches, were in the end like to an high and lofty scaff|old which they ascended to giue them the more shame|full downefall.</P>

who were wont to enuy them. They doe pittifully behold the ruines of their Idoll, and per|ceiue how madde they were to make a wretched mortall man their God, who was but smoake and winde. For if a man consi|der their end, hee may see how in a moment they are vanished: there is nothing so short, as the way from their greatnesse to their ruine, the change was so sodaine, as sight could not comprehend it. They were heere, they were there, they were, and are no more, their foote-steps can hardly bee per|ceiued, to this passe hath their finne brought them, it layde snares a long time for them, &amp; loe, at the last they are fallen

into it. Whilest it vndermined the foundation of their house, they went vp to the top thereof to the end their fall might bee the higher. They still went vp|wards, and thought all beneath them to bee their owne, but at the last they went vp so high, as they lost themselues in the ayre, before they could come downe to the ground, and so vanished like the wind.</P>
<P N="20">20. They became like vnto dreames from which wee awake, for as men say when they awake, I did but dreame this or that: euen so, when such men are gone, the people will say. The greatnesse of these men was but a dreame, it was a meere vanity and

<P N="21">21.
