<HEAD>THE PREFACE Apologetique to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_ALthough that Warres haue beene authorized by the diuine powers, as witnes|seth the new and old Testa|ment, yet me thinkes I heare many nice, peeuish, and ignorant braines blaming me for setting downe to the view of the world (at a few leisurely houres) so many wayes and inuentions how to corrupt and destroy what nature and art striue to make, edifie and conserue, to whom I an|swer they haue the same reason to exclaim against iustice which hath found and or|dained
<PB REF="5">
many meanes to abolish and ex|terminate wicked offenders: for my in|tention is here but onely to finde inven|tions to confound and ruinate Rebells and their habitations; that afterward Empires, Kingdomes, and Common-wealths may the better liue in peace and tranquilitie: and what more is I haue set downe perspicuously this Treatise of Fire-workes, which many heretofore haue written with confusion and great dan|ger, having pend large Volumes with most ample and idle discourses touching this subiect, whose names for modesties sake I will not here set downe with an in|famous character to posteritie (as Master <HI>Robert Norton</HI> hath done some few slight offenders names in the Preface to his translation of <HI>Vianos</HI> works, which he calleth his owne, hauing onely added seuen figures taken out of <HI>Thybourels</HI>

disposed and ordered to such strange ends, that you would say they were set downe to make the Reader laugh, rather then for seruice of Fire-workes eyther for Warres or Recreati|on, as the meanes how to poyson an Armie in the wide Field by the smoake of an artificiall Ball, is it not to be thought a very prettie imagination, or else that the Ball ought to bee some|what bigge; and afterward which is more ridiculous, you shall finde in the same Authours the same ingredients and mixtures prescribed for Fireworks for Pleasure and Recreation: which to mee seemes strange, that the Fire-workes whose smoakes are so venemous even as to poyson Armies in the open Fields, shall bee also fit to burne in the middle of a Cittie or Towne a|mongst

thousands of people for Re|creations: now all these idle conceites with a number of the like are printed in many new and recent bookes, the Authours whereof doubtlesse haue set downe all these ridiculous inventions by ignorance, (thinking them good) and not of purpose for spight; and therefore they doe deserue pittie rather then blame; as well as <HI>Master RO|BERT NORTON,</HI> (who hath er|red onely in attributing another mans workes, and faults to bee his owne) and what is it that giues mee cause to thinke that all these haue erred by ig|norance, is because that all their workes are alike where that they doe speake of Fire-workes.

My intention is here to institute and obserue an order, treating of euery thing one after another in his pro|per and conuenient place: begin|ning with artificiall Fire-workes, as the chiefest and principall cause which hath vrged me to take my penne in hand, the description of those which belong to warres, shall obtaine the first place, and next the Fire-workes for recreation or plea|sure, passing from these to many pleasing Geometricall obserua|tions, aswell of Mecanical ob|seruation, as by the sines, tangents, &amp; succents, ioyning to them a most easie &amp; succent method to fortifie all places regularly and irregularly. And to conclude I will adde many

briefe and instructiue Arithmeti|call examples.</P>
<P>Now to begin with the Fire-workes for warres, I will first de|scribe the Morter-peece, and the vse thereof: that being an instru|ment, the most noble, the most v|niuersal, the best of greatest effect, and of most wonderfull operation of all the instruments, the practise wherof may be vsed amongst Fire-workes for warres, for this instru|ment may serue for a Petard to split, breake and hurle down dores, gates or walles, likewise to massa|cre, teare in pieces, ouerthrow and confound assailants of any place or breach: and for diuers other most worthy offices, and acciden|tall occasions, which happen in the troubles of warres: whereof I will

not here make a long, weary, and tedious discourse, but in few words cleerely set downe the vse of this instrument for the shooting of di|uers sorts of granads, stones, or o|ther weighty burthens to ruine re|bels, their habitations and dwelling places. Then first of all I will treat of the mettle, whereof this instru|ment ought to be made, and mea|sures appertaining thereunto.</P>

<P>_THis Instrument may bee made of diuers sorts of mettle or stuffe, accor|ding to the means, times and occasions which shall offer themselues to those who would make them, or cause them to bee made. The first and chiefest mat|ter of all, is red copper, brasse and tinne, but very little of the two last, such as Canons are made of, with|out any other brickle or harsh met|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> mingled with it, and beeing

If the dia|meter of the calliber or bore be one foot, let the morter be two foot of length, &amp; let the sack or hole for the powder be the third part of a foot broad, and halfe a foot deep, and let the mortar beare in thicknes an inch and a halfe, about one foote high, and the rest onely one inch thicke, the foot shall bee one inch and a halfe thicke, and made square whether the instrument be for the seruice of warres, or recreation, as doth plainely demonstrate the Fi|gure A following. The second met|tle is yron, such as commonly Ordnance for ships are made of: and being cast of this stuffe, the rules prescribed shall be found fit, onely let the mettle be somewhat

<P>But if the instrument be to bee made of either of the two first mettalls, that belongs to the Foun|ders office, but of the two last ma|terials euery man at his owne pleasure may compose it of what size he please, and to begin he must haue a wodden rowler of such big|nesse as he shall desire to make the diametre of his Morter-peece, and vpon that rowler let the pastbords and canuas with good store of glue be rowled: which being done, let them dry a while vpon the rowler, and another while off from the

(as the Founders know right well) they may be also made of yron, or of glasse to cast out of mens hands, so that the glasse bee made very thicke, and these will worke won|drous effects, especially in any throng of horsemen or footmen. And as for the thicknesse of those which are made of brasse, if the di|ameter

<P>_TO avoyde all confusion, I will treat first of all the fires which are cast with violence, and af|terward of those which may be cast out of mens hands.

<PB N="40" REF="29">
whether it be for the offendants or defendants. The chiefest and of greatest operation is made of any kind of brickle mettle as the prece|dents&punc; and their fabrication is not much different from the other, onely more rounder and lesser, and the sin|gle ones hauing a long neck to seem for the Port fire, as doth appeare by the figure A, and first of all the gra|nad is to be filled with fine gunpow|der, and afterward fill the neck with a slow composition as followeth. Take 1. pound of gunpowder dust, two ounces of charcoale d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ust three ounces of saltpeter, al these well min|gled together, fill the portfire requi|red, but this mixture must be well beaten into the port-fire, and the gra|nads being thus finished, they may be kept a yeare, ten yeares, yea twen|ty

if need be. It is to be noted that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hese granads must not be freed vn|till a man is ready to cast them a|way even in the same instant, be|cause
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> the port-fire being consumed, the granad breaks in divers pieces, and each piece sufficient to kill ey|ther man or beast, and therefore the
<PB N="40" REF="30">
handling of them is somewhat dan|gerous. The second manner of Gra|nad to bee cast out of the hand, is made also of brickle mettle, but hath no necke for a Portfire, but is onelie round, hauing in one side a hole as appears by the figure B, and at this hole it is to be filled with drie pow|der, and then is to bee put into this hole to stop it, cotten wieke made as followeth. Take good Gunpowder and steepe it in faire water, and being dissolved, take the cotten wieke and steep it in the Gunpowder dissolued, which done, hang it out to drie; but let it be doubled eight or ten times, to the end that it may the better re|ceiue the powder, and being drie, cut it in such pieces as you shal need, put|ting the one end into the Granad at the hole, and then put that Granad
<PB N="41" REF="30">
into another pot a little bigger then the Granad, as appeareth by the fi|gure C, so that you may put a little drie powder round about the lesser Granad betweene the pots and Gra|nad, then cover the mouth of the last earthen pot either with leather or such like stuffe; and bind it round about with wyre, but first put the wire through pieces of match about halfe a foot of length as may appear by D, and when you desire to make vse of this sort of granad, set on fire euery end of these pieces of match, and cast the pot away, which fal|ling either vpon the ground, or anie souldiers Armour, you shall see the earth-pot breake, the Granad split, and worke such furious effects, eyther at a breach or anie approch.

<PB N="106" REF="62">
for the ayre, or for the ground, haue such strength and force, that beeing once kindled and cast into the wa|ter, they will consume themselues there, and not rise vp swimming as those which are made artificially for the water as followeth. To make good rockets for the water, the calli|ber of the mould ought to bee one inch of diameter, and in length eight inches, the breech to enter one inch, hauing no broach; the rowler for the cartoush shall be three quarters of an inch of diameter, and the charger shal be somewhat lesser then the car|toush being ready to bee filled as the others. Of two sorts of compositi|on, you shall make one as followeth (if you desire to make a great fierie tayle appeare vpon the water, Then take one pound of salt-peter, halfe
<PB N="107" REF="62">
a pound of powder-dust, halfe a pound of brimstone-dust, and two ounces of charcoale-dust: but if you desire to haue it to burne cleere like a candle vpon the water, then take one pound of salt-peter, halfe a pound of brimstone-dust, and three ounces of powder-dust, all these must be well mingled together, as all other compositions) and with either of these compositions, fill your cartoush, and ioyne to the vp|per end a saucisson, and then couer it all with melted pitch, rosine, grease, or painting, to hinder the water from spoiling the paper: and to make it float and swim vpon the water, bind a rode about two foot long to it as to the others for the ayre. Now if that you desire that this Rocket

charge his actions vpon the water, swimming now vpon the water, and now vnder the water, put here and there powder dust, powre to the quantity of halfe a spoonefull as you charge it; also may you make it change colour, now red and then white fire, onely changing the com|position in filling it, and so the indu|strious may adde many changes and diuersities as they shall thinke fit: but if you are to make a great number for a great fireworke, then the plainest are the best, onely filling therewith the first composition; but they must be filled two or three fingers breadth with fine powder dust, to make them flye farre off, or else they must be made like rockets for the aire, and afterward charge them foure inches with composition made for water;

adorne very much a fireworke, and being ill applied they spoyle all.

They may be made otherwise, as fol|loweth, which will make a more beautifull shew; first of all, you must charge the cartoushesas the common saucissons, and then choake them as the common leauing onely a little hole to take fire at, or if the hole chance to stop quite vp, open it with a bodkin, but the saucissons being charged and choaked, there must be part of the cartoush left ouer and a|boue that which is charged, which
