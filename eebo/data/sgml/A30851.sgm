<HEAD>TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCESS, ELIZABETH, DUTCHESS of SOMERSET.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving met with Success in a Poem of this Nature, I was incourag'd to proceed, and lay the Scene again in a Country that, perhaps, hath not been, nor is now inferior for Heroick Personages to any part of the World; and if It is not so esteem'd, it has been through the dulness of our Historians, or the In|gratitude or Designs of our Poets, who may think it an easier Course to write of the Improbable and Romantick Actions of Princes remote, both by di|stance of Time and Place, than to be confin'd at home, where ev'ry School-Boy has a right to be a Crittick, and ev'ry Gentleman an Interest to stand the Cham|pion of his Family, against a rash and inconsiderate Author. I say not this to derogate from those

Excellency of Your real Perfections; and though her Merits rais'd her to a Crown, and she was Queen, her Fortunes were less Miraculous than Yours. For Hea|ven, without a Diadem, never showr'd down so many admirable Blessings of Virtue, Beauty, Birth, Wit, and Fortune, upon any One of Your Sex before. I dare no further attempt their Description with my Igno|rance, lest I speak too Meanly or Irreverently of 'em; therefore I'le leave the mighty Subject to some more Glorious Pen: For none but a <HI>Cowley,</HI> or the best of <HI>Laureats,</HI> ought to write of you: My mean Stile has no other Ornament than Truth; and with that, and in all Humility, I return Thanks for Your most Gra|cious Acceptance of so poor a Trifle, which has scarce given a more happy Life to the Play, than it has to the Author, who is, Madam,</P>

<LG>
<L>TO all Impartial Iudges in the Pit,</L>
<L>And ev'ry beauteous Patroness of Wit;</L>
<L>I'm sent to plead the Poets Cause, and say,</L>
<L>There's not one Slander in his modest Play:</L>
<L>He brings before your Eyes a modern Story,</L>
<L>Yet meddles not with either <HI>Whig,</HI> or <HI>Tory.</HI></L>
<L>Was't not enough, vain Men of either side,</L>
<L>Two Roses once the Nation did divide?</L>
<L>But must it be in danger now agen,</L>
<L>Betwixt our <HI>Scarlet,</HI> and <HI>Green-Ribbon</HI> Men?</L>
<L>Who made this diff'rence, were not <HI>Englands</HI> Friends;</L>
<L>Be not their Tools to serve their Plotting Ends.</L>
<L>Damn the State-Fop, who here his Zeal discovers,</L>
<L>And o're the Stage, like our ill Genius, hovers:</L>
<L>Give us a Pit of Drunkards, and of Lovers;</L>
<L>Good Sanguine Men, who mind no State Affair,</L>
<L>But bid a base World of it self take Care.</L>
<L>We hope there lives not so abhorr'd a Thing,</L>
<L>But loves his Country, and wou'd serve his King.</L>
<L>But in your Parties, why should we engage,</L>
<L>Or meddle with the Plots of a mad Age?</L>
<L>We lose enough by those upon the Stage.</L>
<L>Welcome Mask-Teazer, Peevish Gamster, Huffer;</L>
<L>All Fools, but Politicians, we can suffer;</L>
<L>A Gods name, let each keep to his Vocation;</L>
<L>Our Trade is to mend You, and not the Nation:</L>
<L>Besides, our Author has this further End,</L>
<L>'Tis not enough if but One Side's his Friend;</L>
<L>He needs you All, his weakness to defend:</L>
<L>And to oblige you to't, hopes he has shown</L>
<L>No Country has Men braver than your own.</L>
<L>His Hero's all to <HI>England</HI> are confin'd;</L>
<L>To your own Fathers (sure) you will be kind.</L>
<L>He brings no Forreigners to move your Pity,</L>
