<P>CHRIST'S
Certain and sudden Appearance
TO
JUDGMENT.</P>
<P><HI>By</HI> Thomas Vincent, <HI>sometime Minister
of</HI> Maudlins <HI>Milstreet,</HI> London.</P>
<BIBL>Heb. 10. 37.</BIBL>
<Q>For yet a little while,
and he that shall come, will come, and
will not tarry.</Q>
<P><HI>LONDON,</HI>
Printed for <HI>George Calvert,</HI> and are to

<PB REF="2">
<HEAD>TO THE
Citizens of London.</HEAD>
<P>YOu have heard <HI>God's Terrible Voice in the City,</HI>
expressing it self in the late dreadful desola|ting
Judgments of <HI>Plague,</HI> and <HI>Fire;</HI> the sound of
which hath gone forth, not only into every corner
of the Land, but I believe also by this time, unto
the farthest end of the World. Give me leave to
sound another Trumpet in your ears, and to fore|warn
you of a ten thousand times more dreadful
Judgment, I mean the last and general Judgment
of the whole World, at the second appearance of
the Lord Jesus Christ, who will most certainly and
very quickly be revealed from Heaven in flaming
Fire to take vengeance upon all them which shall
be found ungodly on that Day.</P>
<P>Could I have certainly foretold the many thou|sands,
that sell by the <HI>Plague,</HI> in the year 1665, of
their so neer approaching death, surely they would
have endeavoured to prepare, that the sting and
fear of death might have been removed; could
I have foretold the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> of the many
thousand Houses which should fall by the Fire, in
the year 1666, surely they would have endeavou|red
to prevent the Fire, or at least have removed
all their goods before-hand; but these things could
not be foreseen, and therefore as the Judgments
were unexpected, so they took the most unprovi|ded:
But I can certainly foretell you from God,
<PB REF="3">
who cannot lie, of the future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Judgment, by
the Lord Jesus Christ at the last day, which is the
subject of this ensuing Treatise: And when you
have warnings hereof out of the Word of Truth,
and awakening motives to prepare, by dreadful
temporal Judgments, you should neglect to do it,
and after all be found unprovided at the appearance
of Christ; as your sin will be the greater and more
inexcusable, so your dread will be the greater at the
sight of your Judge (whom those very eyes which
read these lines, will behold ere long coming in
the Clouds) and your punishment will be the more
intollerable: But if the Lord encline your hearts
to follow the directions and counsels of his Word
to prepare for this great and notable day, you shall
lift up your heads with joy, when the greatest part
of the World shall be filled with terrour and con|fusion,
and when the Lord Jesus doth appear, you
also shall appear with him in glory. The design
of these sheets is to set forth the glorious appea|rance
of Christ, with the certainty and suddenness
thereof, that sinners might be awakened to repent,
and believers might be comforted with the hopes
of it, and all might be in a readiness for the day,
which is so sure, and near; which that you may
be, and that my endeavours may be blessed for
your help herein, is the prayer of an earnest well|wisher
to your souls.</P>

<P>1. THe first appearance of Christ was in the
flesh, above sixteen hundred years ago in
the Land of <HI>Iudea,</HI> unto the people of the Jews,
the only-then-visible-Church upon the Earth.
There it was that the <HI>Word</HI> was made <HI>Flesh;</HI> and
amongst that people he dwelt for a while, some of
whom beheld his Glory, the glory as of the only
begotten of the Father, <HI>full of grace and truth.</HI> There
it was that the eternal Son of God was made
man, being conceived miraculously by the power
of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI>
without the contamination of original sin, which
all ordinary conceptions do introduce: His real
Mother, and supposed Father were both of the
Tribe of <HI>Iudah,</HI> and of the lineage of <HI>David,</HI> and
he was born in the Town of <HI>Bethlem,</HI> according
<PB N="3" REF="6">
to the Scripture predictions: who, after he had
lived thirty years in obscurity, was baptized by
<HI>Iohn</HI> Baptist, his Fore-runner and Harbinger; in
whose Baptism, when <HI>Iohn</HI> saw the Heavens ope|ned,
and the Spirit of God descending like a Dove,
and lighting upon him, and heard the voice from
the excellent Glory, saying, <HI>This is my Beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased.</HI> He gave his testi|mony
concerning him, that he was the Son of
God, and the Lamb of God, who taketh way
the sins of the world. Who after his own bap|tism
and temptation, and <HI>Iohns</HI> imprisonment,
made his appearance more openly unto <HI>Israel,</HI>
shewing forth his glory, not in outward pomp
and splendour, but in a more high, eminent, and
wonderful manner, altogether Divine, excee|ding
the imitation of any Earthly Monarch in the
World.</P>
<P>He shewed forth the glory of his <HI>power,</HI> in the
Miracles which he did work, namely in opening
the eyes of the blind, and ears of the deaf; in loos|ning
the tongue of the dumb, and the bonds of
other infirmities; in cleansing the Lepers, and
healing other diseases with a word; in casting out
Devils after long profession; in calming the Sea
and Winds when boisterous and stormy; in rai|sing
up the dead, before, and after burial for some
daies, and the like.</P>
<P>He shewed forth the glory of his <HI>Knowledge,</HI> in
looking into the hearts of those which came unto
him, being able to perceive their most secret
thoughts and imaginations, and needed not that
any should restifie of man, for he knew what was
in man.</P>
<P>He shewed forth the glory of his <HI>Wisdom,</HI> in his
<PB N="4" REF="7">
most wise answer, to the ensnaring questions of
the Pharisees and others, in the most excellent
and heavenly doctrine which he preached, where|in
he did not teach his Disciples subtile and empty
speculations, which the greatest wits in the world
have busied themselves about, but great soul|saving
truths; indeed he revealed some great and
deep mysteries (above the reach of the highest
wit, of the greatest Schollar, without the teach|ings
of his Spirit) which were momentous and
needful in order unto practice, but the greatest
part of his doctrine was plain and easie.</P>
<P>He shewed forth the glory of his <HI>Holiness,</HI> in
his exact walking, and perfect obedience unto
the Law of God, without the least deviation or
sin.</P>
<P>He shewed forth the glory of his <HI>Goodness and
tenderness</HI> towards the children of men, in going
about to do them good, and give succour to them
which were in misery, casting out none which
came unto him.</P>
<P>Especially he shewed forth the glory of his <HI>Mercy
and infinite Love</HI> to his own people, in submitting
to so low a condition as he liv'd in for their
sakes; in humbling himself and becomming obe|dient
unto death, even the cursed, disgraceful,
painful death of the Cross; besides the soul mise|ries
which he endured through sense of Gods
wrath due for their sins, that he might satisfie
Gods justice, and deliver them from eternal death
and wrath to come, and purchase Life and Glory
for them.</P>
<P>Thus Christ lived, and thus Christ died for our
sins, according to the Scriptures; and being dead,
the bonds of death could not hold him, neither
<PB N="5" REF="7">
did the holy one see corruption, but the third day
rose again from the dead, according to the Scrip|tures;
and after his resurrection, was seen of
<HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> of <HI>Peter, Iames,</HI> all the Apo|stles,
of five hundred brethren at once, accor|ding
to the Scriptures. After forty daies was taken
up into Heaven, and is there in his humane na|ture
at the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty
in the heavens, making intercession for his people,
where he will abide untill the second appearance.</P>

thereof? Something the Scripture doth reveale,
and taking the Scripture for my guide, I shall assay
to speak something of it. See <HI>Luke 21. 27. Then
shall they see the Son of man coming in a Cloud, with
Power and great Glory.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>Christ at his second appearance will come with
Power,</HI> with great power; he hath all power put
into his hands in Heaven and in Earth now, and
doth exercise it more secretly; then he will
exercise it more visibly and apparently in the
<PB N="6" REF="8">
sight of the whole world. To give instance,</P>
<P>1. <HI>He will come with power over Death.</HI> Death
hath had great power since the Fall, and is the
greatest Conquerour in the world; Death hath
made an universal Conquest over all the sons and
daughters of <HI>Adam (Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> only excep|ted)
which lived in former generations, and
hath led them captive, binding their faces in se|cret,
chaining their hands and their feet, and
clapping them up close prisoners in the grave,
and none have been able to make resistance; yea,
Death did assail the Lord of Life himself, and
got the victory for a while, and shut him up in
prison; but he got loose before three daies were
at an end, broke open the doors, and gave Death
a deep wound, as it were, and an abolishing
stroke in his Resurrection, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 10. presaging
the compleat victory which afterward he would
obtain over this enemy of man-kind. Now when
Christ makes his second appearance in the world
at the last day, he will exercise his power over
death, he will lead captivity captive, he will
lay his first Hands on Death, and tread this Con|querour
under his feet, and strip him of all his
force and spoils, which he hath been treasuring
up for so many years; he will snatch the keys of
the grave out of the hand of Death, and open the
prison doors and let forth all his captives; he will
loosen all the bonds of Death, and knock off his
chains, and bring out all his prisoners into free|dom
and enlargment: as it is said, <HI>Hos.</HI> 13. 14.
<HI>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I
will redeem them from Death: O Death! I will be thy
Plagues! O Grave! I will be thy destruction!</HI> And it
is said, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 25, 26. that <HI>all enemies shall be
<PB N="7" REF="8">
put under the feet</HI> of Jesus Christ, and <HI>the last enemy
which he shall destray is Death.</HI> And <HI>v. 54. When
this mortall shall put on immortality, then Death
shall be swallowed up in victory.</HI> And surely Christ
must needs come with great power to get victory
over such a potent enemy.</P>
<P>2. <HI>He will come with power over Men and Devils,</HI>
he will have power over all his enemies, which have
rebelled against him; over all the Principalities
and Powers on the Earth, that exercise Lordship
and dominion in the World; he will bring the
Kings of the Earth down from their seats, and
pluck off the robes of Princes; he will take the
staff and the sword out of their hand, and divest
them of all their royalty and greatness; and they
who have employed their borrowed power against
him, how will they quake and tremble before him?
See <HI>Rev. 11. 15, 16, 17, 18. When the seventh Angel
sounded, there were great voices in Heaven, saying,
the Kingdomes of the World are become the Kingdomes
of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign
for ever and ever. And the four and twenty Angels
fell on their faces, saying, we give thee thanks O Lord
God all-mighty, which art, and wast, and art to come,
because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast
reigned. And the Nations were angry, and thy
wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they
should be judged; and that thou shouldst give reward
unto thy servants the Prophets, and to thy Saints, and
them that fear thy name small and great, and shouldst
destroy them which destroy the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>The Kings of the Earth, and great Potentates
will be angry when they are dis-throned; and the
wicked of the Earth will be troubled, when the
Lord Jesus shall come down from Heaven to call
<PB N="8" REF="9">
them to Judgment: If all the Powers of wicked
Men and Devils too, who are greater in power
than Men, could, they would make head, and re|sist
the Lord Jesus Christ, and pull him from his
Throne, and put him to death, as the <HI>Iewes</HI> did
at his first appearance; if they had but any hopes,
of making their party good against him, how would
they call their forces, and gather their Armies, and
wage War with this great King; especially when
all the wicked shall be raised up, and the ancient
Rebels, the Giants of the old World, shall come
forth of their dust, and the Prison of Hell, where
some of them have been tormented by him many
years? O how would they combine their strength,
and so many millions of them together, rush upon
him with rage and violence; and endeavour to a|venge
themselves upon him, at least defend them|selves
against him, when he comes to torment them?
but Christ will come with so great power, that he
will be able to deale with the whole wicked world
of men together, when they are raised and united
in one body, and have obtained more strength of
body, and are filled with more rage and spight of
minde than here they had, and are out of all hopes
of making any peace with him, and have the whole
flock of all the Devils in Hell to joyn in to their
company; I say Christ will come with sufficiency
of strength to binde them all in Chains, and so to
hold them all down that they shall not be able to
make the least resistance; he that hath power to
raise the wicked from the dead, will have power
to keep all <HI>his Enemies from Rebellion, he will come
with Power.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Christ will come at his second appearance with
<PB N="9" REF="9">
great glory;</HI> At his first appearance, he came like a
<HI>Servant,</HI> yea like a <HI>Servant of Servants;</HI> at his se|cond
appearance he will come like a <HI>Lord,</HI> yea
like a <HI>Lord of Lords,</HI> like the great Lord of glory;
at his first appearance he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">loathed with disho|nour,
and a chain of contempt was put about him;
but at his second appearance he will be cloathed
with glory and honour, and most excellent Maje|sty
will be put upon him; at his first appearance
his Deity was vailed, his beauty was masked with
infirm flesh, his brightness was under a Cloud;
though sometimes some beams did break forth with
such a dazling lustre, as made <HI>Peter</HI> fall at his feet
saying, <HI>Depart from me, for I am a sinful Man, O Lord,
Luke</HI> 5. 8. And others in the Ship to worship him,
acknowledging <HI>of a truth thou art the Son of God:
Mat.</HI> 14. 33. And often filled his Disciples with
fear, and astonishment; but he was so disguised in
flesh, that few knew him at all, none knew much
of him, when he was so disrobed, and so meanly
attired, and attended. It is said the Princes of this
World knew him not, else surely they would have
laid down their Scepters at his feet, had they
known him, they would not have dared, so disgrace|fully,
to have crucified the Lord of glory, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI>
2. 8. But at his second appearance, the Vail will
be so drawn aside, that the Deity of Christ will
shine forth with amazing splendour to the view of
the whole World; his humane nature will be glo|rious
beyond any other Creature; but oh how
glorious will his Divine nature be, when the eyes
of the whole World shall be opened to see God in
such a way, as now we are not able to conceive?
He will appear in the brightness of his Fathers
glory, so that they which see him will see the Fa|ther;
<PB N="10" REF="10">
the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">jesty, Authority, Dominion, Power,
Holiness, Justice, and love of the Father, will be
like so many sparkling gems, to deck the Crown of
Christ at his appearance; but who can conceive
the royalty and surpassing excellency of Jesus
Christ, when he comes down out of his Fathers
Pallace, into the World? He will come in great
glory, God will come down in him and with him;
the Throne of God will be removed, the Pallace
will be below, Heaven will be upon the Earth,
where Christ is, there is Heaven, there is God in
his greatest glory to be seen; he will come in great
glory, never was there such glory seen upon the
face of the Earth; never did the eye of man be|hold
such a sight, as then it will behold; we read
of great and pompous showes, which some Princes
have made in their triumphs: but never was there
such pomp in the World, as there will be at this
appearance of Jesus Christ, when he cometh tri|umphing
over all his enemies, when he cometh with
the spoiles of principalities and powers, making a
show of them openly, and decked with such ex|cellent
glory. A little further to set this forth,</P>
<P>1 <HI>He will come attended with a glorious retinue of
Angels,</HI> we read <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tth.</HI> 26. 53. Of <HI>more than twelve
legions of Angels.</HI> And <HI>Dan. 7. 10. Of thousand
thousands, yea ten thousand times ten thousands,</HI> which
Minister about the throne of God; yea further,
<HI>Rev.</HI> 5. 11. Of a number of <HI>ten thousand times ten
thousand, and thousands of thousands of Angels,</HI> and
<HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 22. Of an <HI>innumerable company of Angels.</HI>
All these Angels will attend upon Jesus Christ at
his second appearance. It is said <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tth.</HI> 25. 31.
<HI>That all the holy Angels shall come with him.</HI> Now the
Angels are dispersed in several places, some of
<PB N="11" REF="10">
them are upon the Earth ministring unto the saints,
which shall be heires of salvation. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 14.
Others are in heaven, beholding the face of the
Father ready to execute his will, some are ascend|ing,
some descending; but then they will all be ga|thered
together into one company, and like so ma|ny
Courtiers attend upon this great King in this
his glorious appearance in the World; all will
descend with Christ; Heaven will be emptied of
Angels, they will all come forth, and come down
from their old habitation; and oh how glorious
will this train be! he will come with all the holy
Angels, Angels that are holy and glorious;
not like those rotten Courtiers which attend upon
some Earthly Kings, who have no other glory upon
them, but what lies in their rich and splendid ap|parel;
the bodies of some of which if they were
uncas'd, would appear to be full of loathsome
diseases; but whose souls are monstrously ugly,
and deformed; full of loathsome and noisome
lusts, besmeared with dung and filthiness; who,
could their inside be turned outward, and the de|formity
of sin be seen with bodily eyes, would ap|pear
too hideously black, and swarthy, and more mis|shapen,
than those which are born with the great|est
blemishes of nature; who carry Hell in their
bosomes, and like so many bears and ugly hounds
are led about by the Devil in chains; such, such
follow many Kings on earth, when they appear
abroad, with hearts full of lust; vvith eyes full of
adultery; vvith mouths full of oaths and filthy
ribauldry; vvho are like so many spots in the faces
of their Princes, or like a Cloud about their brow,
vvhich darkneth their glory in the eyes of the seri|ous
and sober minded: but Christ vvill come at|tended
<PB N="12" REF="11">
vvith millions of holy Angels, arrayed in
such pure and vvhite garments, as shall not have
the least spot, or tincture of sin upon them, he
vvill come vvith holy Angels, who vvill be like so
many flames of Fire, full of holy svveet burning
Love, and covered vvith such Light and glorious
excellency, as will not darken, but illustrate the
glory of their Lord and Prince, they attend
upon.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Christ will come with a glorious Brightness, and
great noise;</HI> such a light will shine in him and about
him, as will a thousand fold surpass the light of
the Sun, when it shineth in its full strength: we
read <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. 43. That the <HI>righteous shall shine
like the Sun, in the Kingdome of their Father;</HI> how
then will the Sun of righteousness shine? from whom
they wil receive all their brightness by reflection, as
the Moon and some other Stars do from the Sun in
the firmament. It is said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24. 29, 30. That at
the coming of Christ, the Sun shall be darkned, and
the Moon shall not give her light, and the Stars of
the Heaven shall fall, and <HI>Rev.</HI> 6. 12, 13, 14.
<HI>That the Sun shall be black as Sackcloath of hair, and
the Moon shall be like blood, and the Stars of the hea|ven
shall fall to the earth, even as a Fig-tree casteth
her untimely Figges, when she is shaken of a mighty
winde; and the Heavens shall depart as a scroll
when it is rolled together, and every Island and Moun|tain
shall be moved out of their places.</HI> At the com|ing
of Christ there will be such a brightness as
will darken the Sun and other Luminaries in the
Heavens, even as the Sun, doth darken the lesser
Stars, who though shining all night with a twink|ling
light, and like so many Candles in the Firma|ment,
yet upon the Suns first lifting up his head
<PB N="13" REF="11">
in a morning, and casting about its beames, they
presently sink in their sockets and disappear; so
the Sun it self, and other Luminaries of Heaven
will disappear, when this more glorious Sun doth
arise in the morning of the last day, they will
then lose their light; and what further need of
them? in Heaven it will be all day: <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 22.
<HI>In the City of the new Ierusalem there will be no need
of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it; for the
glory of God will enlighten it, and the Lamb will be
the light of it:</HI> and <HI>Chap. 22. 5. There shall be no
night there, and they shall need no Candle, nor the light
of the Sun, but the Lord God giveth them light, and
they shall raign for ever and ever.</HI> In Hell it will be
all night and&punc; no day, there will be blackness of
darkness for ever, and not the least beam of light
shall shine into that place; and if the Sun and o|ther
Stars be given for the measure and distinction
of times and seasons, when the last day is come,
Time will be no longer, and all must launch forth
from the confines of Time, into the vast Ocean of
Eternity, which cannot be bounded nor measured:
It is said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 11. When <HI>the great white
Throne shall be set,</HI> and Christ is placed thereon,
<HI>that the Heavens and the Earth shall flee away from
before his face, and no more place be found for them:</HI>
and <HI>2 Pet. 3. 10. When the day of the Lord cometh,
that the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the
Earth with all its works shall be burnt up.</HI> Christ
will come with a glorious light, and with a roaring
dreadful noise, which will further set forth the
glory of this appearance, see this expressed, 1 <HI>Thes.
4. 16. The Lord himself shall descend from Heaven
with a shout, with the voice of the Arch-angel, and the
<PB N="14" REF="12">
Trump of God,</HI> and <HI>Matth. 24. 31. He shall send
forth his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet, who
shall gather in his Elect from the four mindes,</HI> Never
was there such a noise heard in the World, as then
will be heard; when Christ shall appear, the hea|vens
will roar; the Earth will be in flames of
Fire; there will be a great shout, and the sound of
the last Trump in the Aire; this shout will be
given by Jesus Christ himself, as is likely, for it is
said, <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. 28, The hour is coming, in which all
that are in their Graves shall hear his voice, and
shall come forth; we read <HI>Iohn</HI> 11. 43. When
Christ came to raise <HI>Lazarus,</HI> that he cried with a
loud voice, <HI>Lazarus come forth,</HI> surely then when
he comes to raise the World, he will cry and shout
with a much louder voice: Such a voice likely
will come down from him in a roaring shout,
<HI>Awake yee dead and come to Iudgement, or arise yee
Children of Men, and come forth of your Graves.</HI>
Never was there such a shout given, as then will be
given, which will be accompanied with the sound
of the Trumpet, the Angels shall sound the Trum|pet:
we read <HI>Exod.</HI> 19. 16. When the Lord gave
the Law from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> that there were <HI>thun|derings
and lightnings, and the voice of a Trumpet ex|ceeding
loud, which made all the People which were in
the Camp to tremble.</HI> O what thunderings will there
be in the aire at Christs second appearance? and
how exceeding loud will the sound of this last
Trumpet be, when Christ comes to judge them
which have broken this Law? That Trumpet was
heard only by the Nation of the Jewes, which were
together about the Mount; this Trumpet will be
heard by all Nations throughout the World; that
Trumpet was heard only by those which were
<PB N="15" REF="12">
alive at that time; this Trumpet will be heard not
only by them that shall remain alive upon the
Earth at the last day, but also by all those which
have dyed throughout all Generations from the
beginning of the Creation; such a noise there will
be as will awaken all that shall be asleep in their
graves. Such a noise as will make all the corners
of the earth to ring, and the pillars of the world
to tremble; but O how will it startle the wicked
when they hear it, and fill them with terrour and
amazement? Thus you have something of the
manner of Christ's second appearance set forth
unto you, he shall come with power and great
glory.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>2. THe second thing is to speak of the end of
Christs second appearance, and the trans|actions
of that day.</P>
<P>The end of Christs second appearance will be
to judge the world; the end of his first coming
was not to judge, but to redeem and save, as he
tells his disciples when they desired him to exe|cute
some judgment from Heaven upon those Sa|maritans
which would not receive him, <HI>Luke</HI> 9.
55, 56. <HI>Ye know not what spirit ye are of, for the
Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to
save them.</HI> And <HI>Iohn 7. 47. If any man hear my
words and believe not, I judge him not, for I came
not to judge, but to save;</HI> but when Christ doth ap|pear
the second time, he will come to judge the
world, <HI>Iude 14. 15. Behold the Lord cometh with
ten thousand of his Saints, to execute judgment upon
<PB N="16" REF="13">
all, &amp;c. Matth. 26. 31, 32. When the Son of man
shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with
him, then shall he sit on the Throne of his glory, and
before him shall be gathered all Nations;</HI> and so he
goeth on in description of the last judgment. In
speaking of Christs judging the world, and the
transactions at that day, I shall show,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Christ will raise up all the dead one of their
graves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That he will gather all Nations before his judg|ment
Seat.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That he will separate the righteous from the
wicked.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That he will open the Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ks out of which all must
be judged.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. I shall speak more particularly of the judgment
of the Righteous, and the Wicked.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>1. Christ at his second appearance will raise up
all the dead out of their graves: there shall be a
general resurrection, <HI>Iohn 5. 28, 29. The hour com|eth
in which all that are in their graves shall hear his
voice and come forth, they that have done good to the
resurrection of life, they that have done evil to the re|surrection
of damnation.</HI> Something hath been spo|ken
already concerning Christs victory over death,
and loosning all his prisoners, but give me leave to
illustrate the resurrection a little further; and
here I shall endeavour to set it forth by an allu|sion
to that notable place, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37. and the ten
first verses. <HI>The hand of the Lord was upon me&punc; and
carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me
down in the midst of the valley, which was full of bones.
And caused me to pass by them round about; there
were very many in the open valley, and so they were
very dry. And he said unto me, Son of man, Can
<PB N="17" REF="13">
these bones live? and I answered, O Lord thou know|est.
Again he said unto me, Prophesie upon these
bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones hear the Word
of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord unto these bones,
Behold I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall
live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and bring up
flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath
in you, and you shall live, and ye shall know that I
am the Lord. So I prophesied as I was commanded,
and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a
shaking, and the bones cam&egrave; together, bone to his bone.
And when I beheld, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o the sinews and flesh came upon
them, and the skin covered them above, but there
was no breath in them. Then said he unto me, Pro|phesie
unto the Winds, Prophesie Son of man, and say
to the Winds, Thus saith the Lord God, come from the
four Winds O breath, and breathe upon these slain that
they may live. So I prophesied as he commanded me,
and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood
upon their feet an exceeding great Army.</HI> Something
like this will the Resurrection be at the last day.
Now the bones and bodies of all former genera|tions
are scattered up and down in the valley of
the shadow of death: some are sunk into the deep,
others are buried in the earth, the flesh is con|sumed,
and resolved into its first elements, and
the bones of some remain, of other are moul|dred
into earth; now when the Lord Jesus Christ,
the Son of God shall come down from <HI>Mount Sion</HI>
which is above, into the <HI>valley of this inferiour
World,</HI> he will Prophesie over all the bodies and
bones of all the children of men that are dead,
and speak unto them to live; he will say unto
them whilst they lie rotting in their graves, <HI>Live;</HI>
he will say, <HI>Awake ye that sleep in the dust:</HI> and O
<PB N="18" REF="14">
what a noise and shaking will there be then in the
ground? what a clattering of bones together in
the coming of bone to his bone? If the body hath
been quartered and buried, part in one place and
part in another; (as the Levites concubine, who
was divided into twelve parts, and sent to the
twelve Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> and it is likely buried in
twelve distinct places;) the bones will fly through
the air out of all those places, and meet together
in one body. O what a great part of the air,
water, and earth will there run into conjunction,
by the command of Christ, and be turned into
those very bodies which were resolved into them
by death, and the corruption of the Pit; but with
the addition of such new qualities as shall subli|mate,
spiritualize, and refine them from all that
dreggishness, and ill humour that shall be the
foundation of any sickness or death for ever; then
the bones will come together, and be made like
stones for strength; then the sinews will be as it
were Iron sinews, and the flesh brasse; such strength
will be put into them, as I conceive is not to be
found in the strongest creatures which hitherto
God hath made; that they might be fitted, the
bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es of the righteous for an eternal life of hap|piness,
and bearing the glory of Heaven: the
bodies of the wicked for an eternal life of misery,
and bearing the torments of Hell; either of which
the body, now as it is, would sink under. Then
the Sea will give up her dead, and the Earth will
give up her dead, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 13. As the Whale cast
<HI>Ionah</HI> upon the shore after he had lain three daies
in his belly: so the Sea will cast up all the dead
that for so many years have been buried in its
bowels: but what a st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rring will there be in the
<PB N="19" REF="14">
earth! those which are alive will wonder to see
such a strange metamorphosis of the ground; to
feel men and women stirring and moving under
their feet, arising and crouding for room amongst
them. Then will the Lord bring down all the souls
of the righteous which have been in Paradise with
him many years, and they shall finde out their own
bodies, and he will open the prison of Hell, and
let out the souls of the wicked for a while, that
they also may finde out their own bodies, which
shall be prepared for both, that they might both
be prepared for the last judgment; of which more
when I come to the particular judgment of the
righteous and wicked.</P>
<P>Thus Christ will raise up all the dead out of
their graves.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Christ at his second appearance will gather all
Nations before his Iudgment seat,</HI> Rev. 20. 11, 12.
<HI>I saw a great white throne, and him that sate on it.
And I saw the dead small and great stand before
God,</HI> 2 Cor. 5. 10. <HI>We must all appear before the Iudg|ment
seat of Christ.</HI> And <HI>Matth. 25. 31, 32. When
the Son of man shall sit on his throne, all Nations shall
be gathered before him.</HI> O what a vast number
will there be when so many hundred generations
of people shall be alive together, and gathered
together into one place! if so be the multitude of
the righteous will be so great when they are got
together into one body, that no man can number
them. <HI>Rev. 7. 9. After I beheld, and lo a great mul|titude,
which no man could number, of all Nations
and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, stood before
the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white
Robes, and Palms in their hands.</HI> What then will
<PB N="20" REF="15">
the multitude of the wicked be, when they are ga|thered
together; in comparison with whom, the
righteous are but few? All Nations shall be gathe|red
before Christs Judgment seat.</P>
<P>3. Christ at his second appearance will sepa|rate
the righteous from the wicked, the Chaff
shall be purged from the Wheat. <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. 12. the
Tares shall be gathered from the good Corn.
<HI>Matth.</HI> 13. 30. the bad Fish shall be divided
from the good, <HI>v.</HI> 48. The Goats shall be separa|ted
from the Sheep, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. 32. By the Chaff,
Tares, bad Fish, Goats, we are to understand the
wicked; by the good Corn, good Fish, Sheep, we
are to understand the righteous: who will be se|parated
one from another, however they are now
in some places mingled and linked together; the
elect shall be gathered together into one com|pany
from the four winds, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24. 31. and
they shall stand on the right hand of Christ, and the
reprobate wicked shall stand on the left, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.
33. In which gathering and separation, there shall
be no mistake, as there may be now. Many close
hypocrites may in this world pass for true chil|dren
of God; they may live together, and hear
together, and pray together, and receive the Sa|crament
together, and make the same profession
of Religion; yea, some hypocrites may, as to our|ward
appearance, seem to outgo some of Gods
own children in zeal and forwardness; the lamps
of the foolish Virgins may seem to shine with a
greater blaze than some of the lamps of the wise;
when they have not the least dram of the oyl of
true grace in the vessel of their hearts, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.
at the beginning; yea, some of Gods own chil|dren
<PB N="21" REF="15">
may here be mistaken for hypocrites (their

no mistake; not only the more openly profane
and notoriously vile generation of the wicked, who
were even professed enemies of Gods people, and

<P>1. <HI>The Book of God's Remembrance will be opened</HI>
This we are to understand in a spiritual sense, no

they were entrusted with the care of souls, they
were set by the Lord for Watch-men, to forewarn
the people of judgments; as Stewards to dispence
the food of the Word, and to give every one their
portion; such and such were Governours of Fami|lies;
whose work was to set up Religion, and the
worship of God in their houses, and labour in their
places after the salvation of the souls, as well as
to set those under them about their civil work, and
to provide for their bodies: such and such were
Children and Servants, whose charge was to yield
obedience to Parents and Governors, in the Lord,
with meeknesse and fear, with readinesse and
diligence.</P>
<P>2 There will be found recorded the places
where such Persons lived; such indeed lived in the
dark places of Heathenisme and Idolatry; but
such and such lived in <HI>Israel,</HI> in a <HI>Goshen,</HI> in a
Land of Light; such and such lived in <HI>England,</HI> in
<HI>London,</HI> in such a religious Family: there will be
recorded the means of grace, which they have en|joyed
in those places; such lived under such a pow|erful
Ministry, heard such heart-awakening and
heart-warming Sermons, and had such sweet
showers of the Word dropping upon them; they
were planted in a fertile soile, and they had fat pa|stures
to feed in.</P>
<P>3 There will be found recorded, the various
dispensations of Gods providence towards them
for their good; such and such had not only Gods
Word, but also Gods Rod to teach them; they li|ved
under the sound of awakning Judgments, they
lived in <HI>London,</HI> when the Plague raged so sorely;
<PB N="24" REF="17">
and when the Fire brake forth and consumed the
City; and such were preserved, when thousands
fell into the Pit; they were brought down to the
Doores of the Grave, and Eternity, and they were
brought up again; they were preserved and provi|ded
for, and every day tasted of the Cup of Gods
goodness, they were loaden with his mercies.</P>
<P>4 And especially there will be found recorded,
all the actions of all the Children of men, and
their carriage towards God, and towards one ano|ther,
in those places, in those relations, under those
ordinances and providences.</P>
<P>1 There will be found recorded all the good
that hath been found in, or done by any from the
day of their Child-hood, to their dying hour; such
and such, they were obedient to Parents when they
were young; they were diligent in learning their
Catechisme, and ready to receive instructions in
the Principles of Religion; such were acquainted
with the Scriptures when they were but Children;
such had tender hearts in their tender years; such
loved God and followed God, when they were but
youths; such and such, had their hearts opened in
hearing of the Word, and enlarged hearts in pray|er;
such were awakned by such Sermons, and con|vinced
and humbled for sin, and perswaded to re|pent
and turn to the Lord: such opened the door
to Jesus Christ, when he knocked, and set up his
Throne in their hearts, and put their necks under
his yoke. Such and such, were frequenters and
lovers of the Ordinances and Ministers of Jesus
Christ. Such made it their business to be religious;
such walked with God in their Families, and were
up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ight in their dealings in the World; such used
to deny themselves, and took up their Cross and
<PB N="25" REF="17">
laboured to follow Jesus Christ where ever he led
them; such mourned for the sins they could not
reform; were thankful for the mercies they recei|ved;
were faithful in the relations they were pla|ced;
were fruitful under the means they enjoyed;
were merciful to their brethren in misery; were pa|tient
and chearful under the Rod, which was laid
upon them&punc; and all the good actions of men will
be had in remembrance.</P>
<P>2 There will be found recorded, all the evil a|ctions,
all the sins of the Children of men. Such
and such were disobedient and untoward children;
slighted the commands of God and their Parents;
were idle, and careless of instruction, and would
not open their eare to discipline; such were old in
sin, when young in years; were strong and skilful
in wicked sinful practices, when their bodies were
but weak, and minds sotishly ignorant in the things
of God; such had good examples before them, but
they would not follow them; they saw dreadful
judgments, but were hardned under them; they
received many mercies, but they abused them;
they had seasons of grace, but they mis-spent them;
they had calls, but they shut their eare against
them; they had convictions of conscience, but
they stifled them; they had motions of the spirit,
but they quenched them; they had proffers of
Christ, and pardon, and salvation, but they refused
them, and turned Gods glory into shame, and his
grace into wantonness. Such and such were Sab|bath
breakers. Such were Svvearers. Such vvere
Drunkards. Such vvere unclean persons, and Adul|terers.
Such vvere Thieves. Such vvere covetous
persons, and Idolaters. Such vvere unjust and un|righteous
in their dealings; Such were bitter and
<PB N="26" REF="18">
reproachful in their speeches. Such vvere injurious
in their actions. All the sins of Men and Women
will be found in the Book of Gods remembrance.
<HI>Deut. 32. 34. Is not this laid up in store with me, and
sealed amongst my treasures?</HI> God stores and trea|sures
up the sins of the wicked and ungodly, against
the day of his vvrath, and their perdition; it is said,
<HI>Iob 14. 16, 17. Thou numberest my steps, dest not
thou watch over my sin, my transgressions are sealed up
in a Bag, and thou sowest up mine iniquities.</HI> God
numbereth the steps of sinners, one by one, sin by
sin, as a man vvould number every step; and he
vvatcheth that he may number aright, he takes ex|act
notice of the foot-steps of every sin; vvhich
leave an impression in the Book of his remem|brance,
as the foot-steps of the body do, vvhen a
man walketh in soft Clay. He putteth the trans|gressions
in a bag, and soweth the Bag, and sealeth
the bag; all which expressions denote Gods exact|ness
in recording and laying up the sins of men.
It is said, <HI>Ier.</HI> 17. 1. That <HI>the sin of Iudah is
written with a Pen of Iron, and the point of a Dia|mond.</HI>
All secret sins will be found there record|ed,
for nothing is secret to God, whose eyes are
like a flame of fire, which gives light to every dark
corner; darkness hideth not from him, but the
night shineth as the day; he looks into every cor|ner
of the Earth, and into every corner of the
heart, and hath set our secret sins in the light of
his countenance: and all open sins will be found
there recorded; no man hath taken so much no|tice
of others sins, as God hath done; he doth as
it were, book all down in his remembrance, and
when Christ comes at the last day, the book of
Gods remembrance will be opened.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="18">
2. <HI>The second Book which will be opened at Christs
coming, will be the Book of Mens own Consciences:</HI>
and this will be the counter-part to every Mans
particular, of What is written in the book of Gods
remembrance, they will finde the same thing there
registred; indeed conscience now may seem to be
asleep, and say nothing whilst men are eating, and
drinking, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">inning; yet conscience is secretly
awake, and busie in writing, and taking notes of
every Mans actions, every day; conscience hath
its day-book, which hath not an empty page; the
mouth of conscience may be shut, and with much
adoe, for the present, restrained from speaking, and
biting; but the eye of conscience cannot be shut
from seeing, nor the hand of conscience restrained
from registring what it takes notice of: every one
in the World hath as it were whole volumes of his
own actions in his bosome, written down by con|science;
and though the letters of some things
done long agoe, may seem to be rased and worn
out; so that a Man cannot read them now; yet
when this Book shall be opened at the last day,
they will appear; in very legible characters; like as
when a Man writes with the juice of a Lemmon
upon fair paper; the juice is white, and the paper
is white, and he cannot read a word when it is
written, nor while it is writing; but let him keep
the paper many years by him, and after bring that
paper close to the fire, the white letters will turn
black, and become very legible: so the consci|ence
of wicked persons is writing, whilst they are
sinning, and they do not perceive it after it is
written; they forget many of their old sins, yea
they do not take notice of them as sins, whilst they
<PB N="28" REF="19">
are committing them; but when the last day is
come, and Christ is come, who will be reveased
from heaven in flaming fire, to take vengeance,
upon them, and the Book of their Consciences
shall be opened before the fire, then all the notes
of conscience will be plain and easie to be read,
and a ready confirmation conscience will give of
all that is written in the Book of Gods remem|brance:
and O how sweet will the testimony of
conscience be of good actions? how bitter will its
records be of sins?</P>
<P>3. <HI>The Third Book which will be opened, will be
the Book of the Law:</HI> which requiring perfect and
perpetual obedience, will condemn all both righ|teous
and wicked, because all have sinned, and by
the Law are cursed, <HI>Gal. 3. 10. Cursed is every one
that continueth not in all things, which are written in
the Book of the Law, to do them;</HI> but then an appeal
will be made.</P>
<P>4. <HI>The fourth Book which will be opened, is the book
of the Gospel:</HI> and there the righeous will finde
the merits of Christ, though they have had none
of their own; they will finde exceeding great and
precious promises of pardon, and salvation, and
eternal happiness, which have been made to all
them that did repent, and believe in Christ, and
restifie the same by their sincere love to God,
making choice of him for their chief good and
happiness, and laying up their treasure in Hea|ven,
and by their sincere obedience to his com|mands,
and walking in heavens way; and then
conscience will give in evidence, and Gods re|membrance
will confirm it, and the Spirit will
witness it, and Christ himself will acknowledge
<PB N="29" REF="19">
it; that all his true disciples have had the qualifi|cations,
which have shown their interest in the
promises; yea, the weakest of believers, what|ever
doubts and fears they have now, will then
certainly know, and confidently plead these qua|lifications
which they have had; they will be
able to say, that they had true faith, though it
were but weak; that they did truly lay hold on
Christ, though it were with a trembling hand;
that they had the faith of reliance and recum|bance,
though they had not the faith of assurance
and strong confidence; that they did heartily re|pent
and grieve for sin, though they had not
that measure of godly sorrow, which they desired;
that sin did not reign in them, though sometime
it did rage and domineer: that they had chosen
God for their chief good, above the whole world,
and the byas of their wills was towards him; and
that they had a sincere love to him, though they
fell short in the fervency, which they desired to
have; that they did walke and keep on in hea|vens
way; &amp; if sometimes they wandred, that they
found their way again; if some times they stum|bled,
that they got up again; and this book of the
Gospel, will give all true believers such acquit|tances
as that they shall not come into condemna|tion,
<HI>Iohn 3. 16. Whosoever believeth in the Son, shall
not perish, but have everl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sting life.</HI> And <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 1.
<HI>There is no condemnation, to them which are in Christ
Iesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spi|rit.</HI>
And the like.</P>
<P>But the unbelievers will get no benefit by this
book; they may finde great and sweet promises,
but not one promise in the whole Book of the
Gospel belonging to them, because they do not
<PB N="30" REF="20">
belong to Christ; they lived and died in impeni|tency
and unbelief, and neglect of Christ and sal|vation,
and now they cannot finde one favoura|ble
word for them; and therefore they will be sent
back to be tried by the Book of the Law, only
the Gospel will double the condemnation of such
as have not yielded up themselves unto its obedi|ence.</P>
<P>5. <HI>A Fifth Book which will be opened, will be the
Book of Life:</HI> Where all the names of the Elect
are enrolled, which when they read, how will
they adore the riches of the free grace of God, in
choosing them before the foundation of the world
was laid; and all those whose names are not en|rolled
in this Book, shall be condemned and cast
into the lake of Fire, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 12, 15.</P>
<P>5. The fifth thing proposed, and the chiefest,
is to speak more particularly, of Christs judging
both the righteous and the wicked, at his second
appearance.</P>
<P>And here I shall speak, 1. of their particular
judgment.</P>
<P>2. Of the execution of their sentence pronounced
in judgement.</P>
<P>1. Concerning the judgment of the righteous
and the wicked.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>THe judgment of the righteous will be first, and
therefore I shall first treat of it, and here
speak,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Of the immediate antecedents to their judg|ment.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="31" REF="20">
2. Of the judgement it self.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>1. Concerning the immediate Antecedents to
the judgment of the righteous.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The first Antecedent to the righteous judgment
will be their resurrection from the dead,</HI> 1 Thes. 4.
16. <HI>The dead in Christ shall rise first; when Christ
descends from heaven, the souls of the righteous shall
descend with him,</HI> 1 Thes. 4. 14. <HI>Them that sleep in
Iesus will God bring with him.</HI> The spirits of all
the just men and women made perfect shall then
come down and finde out their own bodies,
which have been sleeping in the bed of their
graves, and they shall enter again into their old
habitations; they went out of them, it may be
with fear and trembling, with grief and sorrow,
being unwilling to leave them behind, though
they were so rotten and ruinous: but O with what
joy will they return and enter again, when the
building shall be repaired, when their bodies
shall be raised by the power of the Lord Jesus
Christ, and healed of all infirmities, when they
shall be made incorruptible and immortal! see
<HI>1 Cor. 15. 52. In a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last Trump, for the Trumpet shall sound,
and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
be changed.</HI> And vers. 54. <HI>So when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall
have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass
the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in
Victory,</HI> then shall they triumph over death, and
the grave, saying, vers. 55. <HI>O Death, where is thy
sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory?</HI> The Lord
Jesus will then make them victorious over this con|querour,
vers. 57. <HI>Thanks be to God, who hath given
<PB N="32" REF="21">
us the victory, through our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> The
parting of soul and body was never so sad unto
any of the Saints at their death, as the meeting
will be sweet at their resurrection; O how will the
soul wonder at the sudden and strange metamor|phosis
of the body? when the soul left the body
vile to putrify and corrupt in the grave, and shall
finde it come forth more bright and glorious than
gold, after it hath been refined in a Furnace;
when the vile body shall be fashioned like unto
Christs most glorious body, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 21. O how
will the soul delight in the beauty, strength, and
immortality, which then shal be put upon the body,
whereby it will be more suited to its nature, and
fitted for its operations, and participation in its
glory? and how will the body delight in the won|derful
glories and shining excellencies which the
soul hath attained since its separation? If the love
between the soul and the body were so great, when
the body was so vile, and the soul so sinful, what
will it be when both are glorified? If the conjun|ction
between the soul and body were so sweet
vvhen the body vvas so frail and subject to death,
and the soul a spiritual and never-dying substance,
vvhat vvill it be vvhen the body shall be made im|mortal,
and in some sort spiritual? O with what
pleasure will the body awake out of its long sleep
and arise and shake off its dust, and put on its beau|tiful
garments of immortality and glory? with
what delight and joy will it first open its eyes upon
those beautiful and glorious objects which vvill
quickly present themselves to its vievv? Thus
concerning the resurrection of the righteous
bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="21">
2. <HI>The second Antecedent to the Iudgment of the
righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eous, will be their meeting with the Angels at their
Graves mouth, Matth. 24. 31. He shall send his
Angels with the great sound of a Trumpet, and they
shall gather the Elect from the four winds, from one end
of Heaven to the other:</HI> no sooner are they awake|ned
and risen out of their Graves, but they are
entertained by Angels, those holy and excellent
creatures, who have such a dear love to them, and
before have done many good offices for them,
though, when before in the body, they did not per|ceive
it, and were too low, and unfit for their ac|quaintance:
but they will then know them, and
be able to discern the beauty of those lovely spirits&punc;
who for so many years have been beholding the
face of their Father in heaven, which will have
cast such a lustre upon them that will be matter of
their admiration; and these shall be part of their
acquaintance and companions in glory: instead of
Devils, those Angels of darkness, which used to
assault, buffet and molest them, when in the body
before; they shall now have Angels of light with
them, and about them to joyn together in the Love
and praise of the great Jehovah. The Angels will
be sent to call them, and gather them, and we may
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ationally imagine that they will salute them at
their rising, and welcome them out of their graves:
we read of the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s salutation of <HI>Mary,
Luke 1. 28. Hail thou that ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> highly favoured, the
Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst Women;</HI>
and the same Angels words to <HI>Daniel, chap.</HI> 9. 23.
<HI>Thou art greatly beloved.</HI> Such salutations possibly
the Angels may give, to the Saints at their resur|rection.
<HI>Arise you that are highly favoured of God,
<PB N="34" REF="22">
come forth yee that are greatly beloved; welcome, welcome
yee happy ones; ye that are blessed amongst the chil|dren
of men; your Lord is come down and stayeth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> for
you; he hath sent us to call you, and convey you into
his presence, &amp; bring you where he is, that you may see and
share in his glory:</HI> O how will such words make
their hearts to glow within them! how joyfull will
such a message be unto them! O happy they that
ever they were born! or rather that ever they were
new born! O happy they that they should live,
that they should be raised to see such a day as this
will be! O what looks! what speeches! what
joyes will they have, when they are entertained by
the Angels?</P>
<P>3. <HI>The third Antecedent to the Righteous Iudg|ment,
will be their meeting one with another:
Matth.</HI> 24. 31. The Angels will be sent to ga|ther
the Elect together, 2 <HI>Thes. 2. 1. I beseech you
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rethren, by the coming of our Lord Iesus Christ,
and our gathering together unto him;</HI> the Saints will
be all gathered together, and we shall be gathered
with them, if we be found in that number; there
we shall meet with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob,</HI>
and all the holy Kings, and Prophets, and Apostles,
and Martyrs, and holy Men, who have lived in all
Generations; and all these in another hue than
when they lived upon the Earth, they will arise
like so many shining Suns ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Earth; O how
shall we be delighted with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of such a glori|ous
train and company, when we see the Image and
picture of the Lord upon them, drawn so to the
life? what sweet greetings shall we have, and mu|tual
congratulations of our old acquaintance in
the flesh, who were with us acquainted with the
Lord? and is this the end of our hearing and fast|ing,
<PB N="35" REF="22">
and praying, and self-denial, and mortificati|on,
and the poor services we have done for the
Lord? Is this the issue of our pains and labour?
O happy we that ever we repented, and believed,
and closed with Jesus Christ! O happy we that
laid up our Treasure, and waited for our glory and
happiness till this time.</P>
<P>4. <HI>The fourth Antecedent is that the righteous shall
be caught up together in the aire;</HI> all the righteous
shall be caught up, they that are raised from the
dead, and they that remain alive upon the Earth
on that day, 1 <HI>Thess. 4. 16, 17. The dead in Christ
shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain,
shall be caught up together with them, to meet the Lord in
the aire:</HI> we read of the two witnesses, which
were slain; <HI>after three dayes and a half, the spirit of
life from God entered into them, and they stood upon
the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r feet, and they heard a great voice from Heaven
saying unto them, come up hither, and they ascended
up to Heaven in a Cloud, &amp;c. Rev.</HI> 11. 11, 12. In
the morning of the resurrection, the spirit of life
from God will enter into the bodies of all the
Saints, and they will stand up, and possibly they
may hear a voice from Christ in the aire. <HI>Come up
hither:</HI> and then they will be caught up, and ascend
into the aire to meet with their Lord; O what un|expressible
pleasure and delight will they finde
when they <HI>Feel</HI> themselves begin to move upwards,
when they are leaving the Earth and wicked men,
and so many glorious persons of them together
ascending to meet their most glorious Lord!</P>
<P>5. <HI>The fifth antecedent to the judgment, is their
meeting with the Lord in the aire: 1 Thess.</HI> 4. 17.
<HI>Then we which are alive, and remain, shall be caught
<PB N="36" REF="23">
up together with them, to meet the Lord in the aire.</HI>
We have spoken of the meeting of the soul and
the body; of the meeting of the Saints with the
Angels; of the meeting of the Saints with the
Saints; all which meetings will be very delightful,
but the meeting of the Saints with the Lord him|self
will be beyond all. O how sweet will the
sound of Christ's coming be unto them before they
see him? When they hear the long expected shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,
and the sound of the last Trump! <HI>This, this</HI> will
be musick indeed in their eares; <HI>Then, then</HI> they
will lift up their heads with joy; and do but think
how transporting the first glance of their eye will
be upon the Lord Jesus Christ, when they see him
yet afar off, cloathed with such brightness and
beauty; never did their eye behold such an object
before; they admired to see the Saints, and to see
themselves so transformed; but how will they ad|mire
to see the Lord in such glory? if so be that
some of his Disciples did gaze after him with won|der,
when he was taken from them, and ascended
into Heaven, <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 11. With what wonder will
all his Disciples (most of which never saw him in
the flesh, none of which saw him in such glory)
then gaze upon him, when he shall come down
from Heaven! <HI>Yee Men of Galilee, why stand yee
gazing up into Heaven?</HI> Say the Angels. <HI>this same
Iesus which is taken up from you into Heaven, shall
so come in like manner, as yee have seen him go into
Heaven;</HI> if you look and wonder now at his going,
how will you look and wonder at his coming, which
will be as surely, but far more gloriously? But
when they are come neerer unto Christ, and have
a fuller view of him, O vvhat thoughts! What af|fections!
What joyes vvill there then fill their
<PB N="37" REF="23">
souls! O what workings, what beatings of heart! what
transports and ravishment of spirit will they
have! O how would they be overwhelmed with
this sight, and utterly unable to bear it, if they
were not strengthened beyond their present capaci|ty!
<HI>And is this the Saviour and Redeemer of the world?
O glorious Son of righteousness! Did this most ex|cellent
Person, who thus appears in the brightness of
his Fathers glory, and is now come down from his glo|rious
habitation, with such a glorious train of Angels,
once vouchsafe to dwell with men, and vaile his glory in
the flesh! Did this eternal Son of God stoop so low, as
to take upon him our nature, yea to take upon him the
forme of a Servant! Did he live in such meanness
and obscurity; and indure, such hardship, contradi|ction,
reproach and injury, when he was upon the earth!
O infinite condescention! Did this Lord of life and
glory, in the dayes of his flesh so weep, and pray, and
cry; sweat, and bleed, and die, though with such pain,
anguish, and disgrace; yet with such willingness and
patience, in our steads, that he might redeem us from
sin, and death, and wrath to come; that we might not
perish, but have overlasting life? O wonderful, uncon|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eivable
love! What, so glorious a Person to be made
man! to be made sin! to be made a curse! to do such
things! to suffer such things! for such mean, vile
cursed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">inners as we, that we might be blessed and happy
with him; O surpassing superlative kindness! Is this
he who made choice of us, when he chose so few, that
called us when the most were passed by, that pitcht his
love upon us, when there was no attractive in us, no|thing
to move him, but his own bowels, that revealed
his secrets to us, when he hid them from the wise and
prudent, that brought us nigh when we were afar off&punc;
and made us fellow-Citizens, and fellow-heirs with the
<PB N="38" REF="24">
Saints, and of the houshold of God, who were by na|ture
children of wrath, even as others? O astonishing
free grace! Is this he who cloathed us when we were
naked, even with the robes of his own righteousness?
that washed us when we were defiled, even in the foun|tain
of his own blood? that cheared us when we were
troubled, even with the comforts of his own Spirit?
that strengthned us when we were weak, even with his
might and glorious power in our inner man? was it
from this Person that we received our pardon, our peace,
our supports, our graces, our encouragements, and all
the sweet refreshments we have found in Ordinances?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Is this the Advocate whom we made choice of, relied,
and trusted upon f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r life and salvation? Is this the
Master whom we followed, and whose work we were im|ployed
about? Is this the Captain whose colours we wore,
and under whose banner we fought? Is this the Lord
whom we obeyed! the friend, the husband whom we
loved? and is he so glorious!</HI> O how will the Saints
be wrapt up with admiration and joy! how will
they be all in a flame of burning love and affecti|on,
when they come to behold the Lord Jesus
Christ himself, and view him in such glory, as
then he will be decked withall? when they come to
see him face to face, who hath such loveliness in
his face, and such love in his heart unto them.
It is said, 1 <HI>Pet. 1. 8. whom having not seen ye love,
in whom though now ye see him, yet believing ye re|joyce
with joy unspeakab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e and full of glory.</HI></P>
<P>If so be that the Saints do now love Christ,
whom they never saw, only have heard of, and be|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eved
the report of the word; how will they love
him when they have this sight of him, and see a
thousandfold more beauty in him than was re|ported,
or could be imagined? if so be that now
<PB N="39" REF="24">
sometimes they rejoyce, with glorious and unspeak|able
joy in believing, what will they do when
they come to see him in his glory? If they can
now rejoyce in tribulations, and take pleasure&punc; in
the cross and reproach of Christ, what will they
finde in their masters joy, and the Crown which
he now comes to put upon their heads? O how
glad will they be that they have been counted
worthy to suffer any thing for such a Saviour? It
will be a joyful time indeed unto the Saints when
they are caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord
in the air.</P>
<P>And the joy of Christ will be no less, to meet
with them; O with what an eye will he view
them, when they are arising and ascending with
so much of his beauty and lustre upon them&punc; none
can conceive the love and delight which the Lord
Jesus will take in them at that day: he will
look upon them as those who were beloved by the
Father and himself from all eternity; as those
who fetcht him out of heaven before to redeem
them, and now to glorifie them; he will look
upon them as the travel of his soul; as the price
of his blood; he will look upon them as his Jew|els;
as spoils taken out of the hands of his ene|mies;
he will look upon them as plants grown
up unto perfection; as servants who have done
their work; as those who have kept up his honour
in the world; he will look upon them as members
of his body; he will look upon them as his dea|rest
spouse, and most beautiful bride, who now
cometh to be joyned to him more neerly, and to
live with him for ever. O the love and joy of
Christ at this meeting! If so be that Christ so
dearly loved his Spouse, and could delight in her
<PB N="40" REF="25">
too, when she was black and sooty, when her
clothes were spotted, and stained, when her affe|ctions
were weak, low, and inconstant; how
will he love and rejoyce in her when she is made
perfectly like to himself, and so beautiful with his
comeliness? when her stains are all washed off,
and she is presented before him without spot,
wrinkle, blemish, or any such thing? when she
shall be arrayed in white, and hath put on her
shining garments, and appear so lovely, and her
love shall be so high, and full, and strong, and fla|ming?
Never did Lovers meet with such delight, &amp;
joy on their wedding-day, as Christ and his Spouse
will meet at the day of his second appearance;
O the sweet smiles the Saints will see in the face
of Christ! Smiles upon them, such glances of love
will sparkle forth from his eyes, as will ravish
their hearts; O the sweet words they will hear!
the welcome he will give them when they first
meet! when they are come, he will place them at
his right hand. So much concerning the more
immediate Antecedents of the judgment of the
righteous.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>2. THe second thing is to speak concerning the
Judgment it self, of the righteous. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
there are two things the Scripture speaks of, which
Christ will do at his second appearance, in the
judgment of the righteous.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He will take an account of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He will pronounce the sentence upon them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. Christ will take an account of the righteous
<PB N="41" REF="25">
<HI>Rom. 4. 10, 12. We shall all stand before the judg|ment-seat
of Christ, and every one of us shall give an
account of himself unto God;</HI> though the righteous
shall not be brought to condemnation, yet they
shall be brought into judgment, which will be
for their masters honour and their own; especially
of those who can give a good account of the Ta|lents
their Lord hath intrusted them withall.</P>
<P>I know it is a question amongst Divines, whe|ther
the sins of Gods people will be mentioned,
and made manifest at the last day of judgment;
I shall not determine the question, since the
Scripture is not so plain; Possibly the Lord having
pardoned them, covered them, blotted them
out of the book of his remembrance, he will
not mention them on that day; but sure I am
if they should be mentioned, it will not be to
their disgrace and grief, but to their more abun|dant
jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the Lord, who hath forgiven them:
If they should read their sins in the book of Gods
remembrance, they will finde them, like so
many debts crossed out with the red lines of Christs
blood: If the Devil should be permitted to ac|cuse
them at that time, who is now the accuse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of the Brethren, and rip up their secret faults;
the Lord himself will stand up and plead for them;
he will make known the sufficient value of his
merits for their ransome, and publiquely acquit
them from all guilt and condemnation; <HI>who shall
lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect, it is God
that justifieth? who is he that shall condemn? it is
Christ that died for them. Rom.</HI> 8. 33, 34.</P>
<P>But these four things Christ will take an ac|count
of, in the judgement of the righteous.</P>
<P>1. <HI>He will take an account of their graces.</HI> The
<PB N="42" REF="26">
vessels of the Virgins will be lookt into, what
Oile they have go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">; the hearts of the Saints will
be lookt into, what graces they have obtained.
Christ will then take notice what godly sorrow
they have had for sin, their secret weeping and
mourning will then be made manifest; he will
take notice what humility and meekness, what
self-denial and patience they have had; especially
what faith, and love; and hope, and spiritual joy,
they have had, and all their raised affections to|wards
himself, and heavenly things, in his ordi|nances;
and his judgment of grace will not be
according to the appearance and show which hath
been, but according to truth; and then the Saints
shall be ranked, not according to their esteem and
dignity in the world, but according to the measure
of the graces they have attained.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Christ will take an account of the improvement
of the talents of graces and gifts, and opportunities of
service which he hath entrusted them withall. Mat.</HI> 25.
19. and Christ will then take chief notice of those
which have been most industrious and faithful, and
instrumental for doing most good, and bringing
most glory to his name; and though all shall
have a full reward, that are found truly faithful,
and shall enter into their masters joy; yet <HI>they</HI>
shall have a more full reward, and be capable of
more joy and glory than the other.</P>
<P>3. And especially, <HI>he will take an account of their
works of mercy,</HI> Matth. 25. 35, 36. <HI>I was hungry, and
ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me
drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked,
and ye cloathed me; I was sick, and ye visited me;
<PB N="43" REF="26">
I was in prison, and ye came unto me, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It will even astonish and confound the righte|ous,
to hear such language as this from the Lord
Jesus Christ, when he appears in such glory, they
will be ready to question, when he was in any
want, and received relief at their hands: <HI>When saw
we thee a hungry, or a thirst, or naked, and ministred
any help?</HI> we received all from thee, but we could
give nothing to thee: thou didst relieve us, and
redeem us out of the deepest poverty and misery
in which we were sunk, and should have perished
without thy help; but what relief hadst thou from
us? <HI>Then the King will answer and say unto them,</HI>
v. 40. <HI>Verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have
done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have
done it unto me.</HI> At such a time, and such a time,
the poor came to you for relief, making use of
my name, whose backs for my sake you cloathed,
and whose bellies you refreshed, and whose ne|cessities
you supplied; that was done unto me;
though they were poor, they were my brethren;
some of my servants were brought into straights
for conscience sake, and you received them, or
sent help to them; you received me then, and gave
help to me; that money was not thrown away, it
was given to me, and I am come to give you a
thousandfold reward. Were this truth more effectu|ally
believed, what a forwardness would there be in
Christians to works of mercy? Surely they would
look upon that part of their estate as best impro|ved,
which in such works is bestowed. Christ
doth not mention any other use which they put
their money unto, which if worthy to be compa|red&punc;
would be made mention of; he doth not speak
of so much laid out in building, so much laid out in
<PB N="44" REF="27">
cloathing, so much laid out for food; so much laid
up in portions for children; all this the wicked
can do; but so much laid out to the poor, and me
in them, which is the only part you have laid up
for your selves; and which I am now come to re|turn
unto you with usury.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Christ will take an account of the afflictions
which the righteous have endured;</HI> especially, of
their sufferings for his sake; such reproaches, such
losses, imprisonments, banishments, buffetings;
but if they have suffered death, with what honour
will this be made mention of? with what great
esteem will he receive and speak unto them,
which have come out of great tribulation? and O
the joy in this morning, after the tears of the
night! then they will finde that their <HI>light afflicti|on
which they have endured for a moment, hath wrought
for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory. 2 Cor.</HI> 4. 17.</P>
<P>2. The second thing in Christs judegment of
the Saints, is the <HI>Sentence</HI> which he will pro|nounce
upon them; which will be a most graci|ous
invitation of them to take possession of the
Kingdom of Heaven, which he hath prepared for
them, <HI>Matth. 25. 34. Then shall the King say unto
them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the Kingdom prepared from you, from the foun|dation
of the world.</HI></P>
<P>All Christs invitations in Scripture are very
sweet. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy
laden, and I will give you Rest, Matth,</HI> 11. 28. How
sweet is this to a troubled conscience, and an
oppressed spirit, ready to sinke under the burden
<PB N="45" REF="27">
of sin? <HI>Ho every one that thirsteth, come to the wa|ters;
and he that hath no money, come buy wine and
milk without money, and without price. Isa.</HI> 55. 1.
O what sweet words are these to those which are
parched, and pained, and ready to die with spi|ritual
thirst, and can finde nothing in the crea|tures
which can give them any satisfaction or ease?
But of all the words that ever Christ did speak, of
all the invitations that ever Christ did make, this
will be the sweetest, which he will give to his Dis|ciples
at the last day, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foun|dation
of the World. Come ye blessed and happy ones,</HI>
however accounted miserable ones by men, yet
blessed of my Father, <HI>Come inherit the Kingdom pre|pared
for you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m the foundation of the World:</HI> Take
possession of your eternal inheritance; Come enter
into the Kingdom of glory, which the father hath
chosen you unto, and called you unto, and which I
have purchased, and now fitted and made ready for
you: Come along with me, and I will shew you
my glory; and where I am, there ye shall be also.
Come along with me into Heaven, and ye shall
live and reign with me for ever and ever. Come
along, and enter now into your Masters joy; come
and I will shew you the Father, and bring you
into his house and presence, where there is ful|ness
of joy, and pleasures for evermore. And

what exultations! what clapping of hands! what
shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ings! what Hallelujahs! what Hosannahs!
what triumphing acclamations the Saints will
make upon the hearing of these words. But here
words fail&punc; conceptions fall short, who can utter
what the affections, and behaviour of the righteous

will be, when they have their sentence, and hear
such sweet, and gracious words from the mouth of

<P>2. COncerning the judgment of the wicked, at

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Of the immediate antecedents.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Of the Iudgment it self.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. The immediate Antecedents of the judgment
of the wicked will be,</P>
<P>1. <HI>The Resurrection of their Bodies from the grave;</HI>
all the wicked that are dead shall be raised, though
not so soon, yet as certainly as the righteous, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.
28, 29. <HI>The hour cometh, that all that are in their graves
shall hear his voice,</HI> (not only) <HI>they that have done good
shall come forth to the Resurrection of life,</HI> (but also)
<HI>they that have done evil, to the resurrection of demna|tion.</HI>
When the wicked die, their bodies are <HI>clapt
up in the Prison of the Grave,</HI> where they rot and pu|trifie
under the chains of death, which are laid up|on
them&punc; and their souls are <HI>shut down into the Pri|son
of Hell,</HI> where they are bound up in chains of
darkness, and wo, and reserved unto the judg|ment
of the great day; when the Lord Jesus shal
appear to judge the World, he will bring the keys
of death and hell along with him, and open both
these Prison doors, not to give liberty and releas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
to the Prisoners; but as Prisons are opened at As|sizes,
<PB N="47" REF="28">
to bring them forth unto Judgment; he will
open the Prison of Hell, and all the souls of the
wicked shall come forth like so many Locusts out
of the bottomless Pit; and he will open the Prison
of the Grave, and all their bodies shall creep like
so many ugly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oades out of the Earth; and then
soul and body shall be joyned together again, and
this meeting will be sad, beyond expression; the
meeting of the souls and bodies of the righteou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
will not be more joyful, than the meeting of the
souls and bodies of the wicked will be doleful;
possibly some of the wicked had no bands in their
death, and their souls went forth of their bodies
without much pain or fear; but their entrance in|to
their bodies again, will be with unexpressible
horr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ur; and if some of the wicked had their
consciences awakened at death, and they lay down
with terrour; when they awake and rise again from
the dead, it will be with far greater terrour. The
old World dyed in a fright, with the deluge of
Water, which over-whelmed them; <HI>Corah, Da|than,</HI>
and <HI>Aliram,</HI> with their Company, died in a
fright at the cleaving and opening of the Earths
mouth, which swallowed them up; <HI>Iudas</HI> and o|ther
despairing souls died in a fright, at the appre|hensions
of the open mouth of Hell, ready to re|ceive
their guilty spirits; but none of the wicked
could go forth of their bodies in such a fright as
they will enter into them again at the last day:
the damned souls have been lying in Hell many
years, full of anguish in their separation, and they
know that their anguish will be encreased by the
torment of their bodies in their union, and no
wonder if they be exceedingly unwilling and fear|ful
to enter into their old lodging; their bodies
<PB N="48" REF="29">
have been sleeping all this while in the dust, and
have felt no pain at all; and O how unwelcome a
guest will their souls then be? never was death so
terrible unto them, as life will be at that day;
they had rather sleep still in their grave, and con|tinue
in their rottenness and corruption; they had
rather lie hid for ever in the dust of oblivion, or
be quite annihilated like beasts, than to arise again
unto such torments, as now they must undergo;
but they must arise willing or unwilling; It is said
that <HI>the vile bodies</HI> of the righteous <HI>shall at the last
day be fashioned like unto Christs most glorious body,
Phil.</HI> 3. 21. They shall be made like unto Christs
body in beauty and glory; but the bodies of the
wicked will have another hue and fashion; if it
were possible to fashion bodies like Devils, those
impure and foul spirits, such spiritual bodies the
wicked should have; be sure their bodies shall
have no glory put upon them; but as they lay down
vile bodies, they shall rise up far more vile; they
lay down in dishonour, and they shall be raised in
far greater dishonour; indeed they will be raised
incorruptible and immortal; but this will not be
for their glory, but that they may be capable of
the greater and longer torment and misery; their
bodies will be so far from being made beautiful
like unto Christ, that I believe they will not re|gain
that natural beauty which they had here upon
the Earth; now some of them ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">-shine Gods
own Children (whose chief beauty lies inward)
in external comeliness; then none but the bodies
of Gods children will shine; the bodies of the
wicked most probable will be swarthy, black, ugly,
monstrous bodies; if there be a ghastliness upon
the bodies of the most beautifull, when they are
<PB N="49" REF="29">
dead, what a ghastliness will there be upon the bo|dies
of all the wicked, when the second death shall
seize upon them? were their bodies never so beau|tiful
in themselves, yet their features would quick|ly
be altered by the horrible passions of their
minde; the blackness and dread of the soul would
quickly appear in their countenance; besides the
impressions which the Fire of Hell will have upon
them. The soul will finde nothing in the body
which will give it any delight or ease, or in the
least contribute unto the asswagement of its an|guish;
it will return into the body as into a Pri|son,
or Dungeon, where there is no pleasure to be
found: and if the body be black, how black will
the soul be, after so long abode with foul Devils
in the lower Regions of darknesse? And when
such foul souls, and such vile bodies meet, what a
meeting! what a greeting will there be! we may
fancy a kinde of language to be between them, at
that day. The soul to the body, <HI>Come out of thy
hole thou filthy dunghil flesh, for the pampering and
pleasing of whom, I have lost my self for ever; who
hast stollen away my time, and thoughts, and heart
from God, and Christ, and Heavenly things, to feed,
and cloath, and cherish thee, and make provision to sa|tisfy
thy base deceitful lusts, when I should have been
making provision for thine and mine everlasting happi|ness.
Awake and come forth of the dust, thou bewitching
dirty flesh, who didst lull me asleep so long in thy plea|sing
chains, until thou didst suddenly open thy doores
and thrust me out, where I was awakened in torments
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">efore I was aware, now I must come into thy doores
again, that thou maist share and taste the bitter issue of
sinful pleasures and delights.</HI> And O how will the
body be affrighted, so soon as the soul is entered!
<PB N="50" REF="30">
never did the soul taste so much of the bodies de|lights,
as the body will then feel of the souls an|guish.
The body to the soul, <HI>And hast thou found
me out O my enemy? Couldst not thou have let me
alone to lye still at rest in this sweet sleep? hast thou
used me as a slave, and employed all my members as
servants of iniquity, and unrighteousness, and art thou
come now to torment me! and is this the fruit of all
the pleasures we have taken together? shouldst not thou
have been more wise, and provided better for thy self
and me?</HI> O what cries and shreeks will the tongue
give forth, so soon as it hath recovered its use! O
what fearful amazing sights will there appear be|fore
the eyes, so soon as they are opened, when they
first peep out of the Grave, and sinners see Heaven
and Earth on Fire about them, and Christ coming
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">laming Fire, to take vengeance upon them? O
how dreadful will the shout, and the voice of the
Arch-angel, and the sound of the last Trumpet
summoning them to judgment be unto the eares?
O how will every joynt and member of the bodies
of the wicked tremble, when they are raised again
at the last day?</P>
<P>2. <HI>The second Antecedent to the judgment of the
wicked, will be their meeting with Devils;</HI> the righ|teous
will meet with Angels to welcome them out
of their Graves; the wicked will meet with De|vils
to entertain them at their resurrection; and
then they will not appear unto them, like Angels
of light, as sometimes here they have done; but
like foul Angels of darkness, as they ever were
since their first fall; they will not then entertain
the wicked with pleasing baits, and sweet alluring
temptations, and pretend to be their friends, who
<PB N="51" REF="30">
consult their good and satisfaction, beyond God
himself, the chief good of mankind; as they did
when their abode was in the world before: but they
will spit forth their venome, and malice, then, in
their faces; possibly they may buffet their bodies,
and lay painful strokes upon them; surely they
will terrify their soules for those sins which they
have drawn them unto the commission of; O hovv
vvill they mock, and deride their folly, and mad|ness
for opening their eares to their vvhispers, for
opening their heart so readily, vvhen they have
knockt at the door, and entised them unto sin?
then the damned will perceive that the Devils de|sign
vvas their ruine and misery, vvhen the pre|tence
and show was consultation for their good
and happiness; that he laboured to please and
delight them, not out of love, but malice, that he
might undo them; that he lull'd them asleep, that
they might not perceive their misery, till it was
too late; that poison was in his sweetest baits;
and that their softest pleasures were Sathans silken

will they look one upon another? and if they
speak, what language of Hell will there issue forth
of their lips? they may meet with their old com|panions

like such as they now call meetings of good-fel|lowship,
when they get together in a Tavern and
Ale-house, or some house of wickedness, to
drink, and sing, and daunce, and sin, and make
merry in the pleasing of their flesh; they shall
not then have Ale, and Wine, and Women, and
Musick, or any incentives to mirth and sensual

but sad and dismal; the pleasing affections
which they formerly had to their friends will be
changed; their love will be turned into hatred;
and the joy they have found in them will be tur|ned
into grief and anger; O the angry countenan|ces

<P>Fain would I have had you all up along with me,

with the unfruitful works of darkness, and workers of
iniquity; but you would go on in the broad way, because
it was more easie; the way to heaven was too narrow and
difficult for you: if profession would have been enough,
and external joyning you selves to Gods people would
have brought you to heaven, this some of you could do with
readiness sufficient; but when you must have a power

your selves, take up the cross, be so strict in your lives,
make conscience of thoughts, words, and all your

to be religious sometimes by the by, and when you
had nothing else to do; but to make it your business to
be religious, you could not endure: you could put on
a forme and outward vizard of godliness on the Sab|bath
daies; but to be religious on the week daies, and
every day, to be holy in all manner of conversation,
this was too much, and a hard saying which you could
not bear: and if you did not like the terms of the Gos|pel,
and would be the servants of the Devil, whilst
you seemed to be the servants of Christ; and go on
covertly in the way to Hell, whilst you seemed to be
going in the way to Heaven; what can I do for you
now? I thought you would have shined and gone with

preach to you, when the arrows were flying so thick
about you; I ventured my liberty for you, my health
for you, and was often spent for you, and amongst you,
that I might be instrumentall to call and save you:
but when the thunder of Iudgments was a little over,
and out of hearing, you quickly dropt asleep, and the
voice of preaching could not enter your ears and awaken
you: Alas! why do you look upon me now with such
rufull countenances, and stand with such trembling
joints, and speak so earnestly unto me, as if some|thing
might yet be done for you, and are loath to let
me go from your company? Alas! what can I do for
you now? should I stay and preach unto you again,
and call, and invite you to Iesus Christ, and open the
treasures of the Gospel, and now you will open your
ears, and hearts to receive? Alas! now the mysterie
of God is finished, the treasures of the Gospel are shut
up, and sealed, and the day of grace is quite spend and
gone, and cannot be recalled; could not you have
opened before, when you know I knocked often, and
hard, in my Masters name for entertainment? I cal|led,
but ye refused; I stretched out my hand, and
lifted up my voice like a Trumpt; but you did not
regard and follow the counsels which were given unto
you; and now my preaching work is done for ever.
Should I sty and pray with you, and for you, that God
would pardon your sins, or defer your judgment but a
little while, if it were but for a week, or a day, that
you might prepare your accounts, and O how presently
would you make your peace with God, how readily

that liveth for ever and ever, that time shall be no

hang about me with teares and weeping? what can I
do for you now? can I carry you all up with me in

and if all of us together could hand and help some of
you up into the aire with us, and bring you into

With what confidence could you stand before him?
With what face could you look upon him, when you
are so black, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ilthy, and have such guilt upon
your consciences? Would not your looks betray you
to be none of our number? Would not your black
and trembling joynts speak what you are? and
would not Christ then frown you away from our

from on high amongst your fellow hypocrites and un|believers.
Could we carry you up with us? if you

<P>5. <HI>The fifth and most dreadful Antecedent to the

cometh with Clouds, and every eye shall see him, and
they also that pierced him, and all kindreds of the
Earth shall wail because of him: even so, Amen.</HI>
Every eye shall see him, not only the righteous,
but also the wicked; and they also that pierced
him, that is, the Jewes which crucified him, as
he saith, <HI>Matth. 26. 64. Hereafter shall yee see
the Son of Man, sitting on the right hand of power,
and coming in the Clouds of Heaven.</HI> O how fear|full
will the sight of Jesus Christ be to <HI>Iudas,</HI> that
betrayed them, unto the Officers that took him,
unto the base Servant that smo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e him with the palm
of his hand; unto the people that mocked and spit
upon him, unto the Pharisees that accused him,
unto <HI>Pilate</HI> that scourged and condemned him, un|to
<HI>Herod</HI> that scorn'd him, unto the Souldiers that
mocked and crucified him, unto the Priests that
stirred up the People and <HI>Pilate</HI> against him, and
in the midst of his agony and anguish railed on
him? though they did not see him come down
from the cross, yet when they see him come down
<PB N="60" REF="35">
from heaven, they will believe that he was the
<HI>Messias;</HI> and O how will this sight terrify them?
then they will smite their breasts indeed, and be
filled with horrour, when they perceive that the
same Jesus was the Son of God, and is now the
Judge of the World, and is come to call them
before his Bar, who then did stand before theirs;
the High Priest that rent his cloathes, when Christ
call'd himself the Son of God, will be ready to
rend himself in pieces for not acknowledging it;
and with what face will <HI>Iudas</HI> look his Master in
the face, when he sees him come in such glory!
and if some Souldiers that kept Christs Sepulchre,
did so shake, and become like dead men at Christs
resurrection, when they saw the Angel, whose
countenance was like lightning, and raiment white
as Snow, come and roll away the Stone from be|fore
the door thereof: <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 2, 3, 4. O how
will they all that had a hand in his death, quake and
tremble, when they see the Lord Jesus Christ him|self
come with such Power and Glory, and all the
Holy Angels with him, to call them to Judgment?
Further it is said that all the kindreds of the Earth
shall wail because of him, so <HI>Matth. 24. 30. All
the Tribes of the Earth shall mourn, when they see
the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven;</HI>
this we are to understand of the wicked kindreds
and tribes of the Earth; the sight of Christ will be
matter of the greatest Joy unto his Disciples, but
of the greatest sorrow unto the wicked World;
the mourning of the wicked, see how it is set forth,
<HI>Rev. 6. 15, 16, 17. And the Kings of the Earth,
and the great Men, and the rich Men, and the chief
Captains, and the mighty Men, and every Bond-man,
and every free-man hid themselves in the Dens, and in

Rocks, and to the Mountains, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll on us, and hide us
from the face of him that sitteth upon the Throne, and
from the wrath of the Lawb, for the great day of his
wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</HI> Then
profane and wicked Kings, who would not submit
unto the Government of Christ, but brake his
bands asunder, and cast away his cords from them,
shall see this King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,
come down from heaven to judge them, and O
with what fear would they then run and hide them|selves
in Dens, or under some great Rocks and
Mountains, if they could, from the face of him
who will then sit upon the Throne of Judgment!
and with what trembling will they stand amongst
the meanest of their subjects, devested of all their
power and dignity? then the Nobles and great
Men of the Earth, who having been lifted up a|bove
the ordinary degree of men, have lifted up
their hearts also with pride and haughtiness be|yond
measure, and let loose the reigns unto licenti|ousness,
and wallowed in filthy delights and plea|sures,
shall see the Son of Man coming in the
Clouds; and O how will their proud hearts then
be brought down, and their haughtiness laid low,
and their sweet sinful delights be turned into bit|ter
gall and wormwood! then they will cry to the
Rocks to cover them, and the Mountains to hide
them: if they can finde any such place to receive
them in this terrible day. Then the chief Captains
and mighty Men, who employed their force and
strength under the banner of the Devil, and en|deavoured
to promote the interest of his King|dome
in the World, and rebelled against the Lord
of Hosts, shall see the Heavens opened, and this
<PB N="62" REF="36">
mighty Captain come down with the Armies of
Heaven attending upon him in white, to execute
vengeance upon them, and then their courage will
fail them, and the wrath of the Lamb will make
them tremble, and they would creep into a Rock,
or any hole to hide them; then the rich men who
have placed their hearts and confidence in their
riches; especially those who have heaped up riches
by injustice and unrighteous practises shall see the
Son of Man coming against them, and weep and
howl for the miseries which are coming upon them;
and their riches will be so far from profiting them
in the day of wrath, that they will be witnesses
to accuse them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d aggravate their condemnation;
Then every Bond-man and every Free-man that
are slaves to the Devil and their own lusts, shall see
the Son of Man coming to judge them, and be in
the number of the mourners, crying to the Moun|tains
to fall on them. Then there will be distress
upon all Nations, and great perplexity, Sea waves
roaring, and Mens hearts failing them, for fear,
when they are looking up into the Clouds, and see
the Son of Man is come down, and his Throne is
prepared for judgment. The Heathen Nations
will mourn to see him, especially the wicked who
have had the name of Christians upon them, and
have sat under the light of the Gospel; O how
will their faces be filled with shame and confu|sion,
and their hearts with terrour and astonish|ment,
when they behold the face of the Lord
Jesus Christ shining with such beauty and glory,
but looking on them with anger and disdain? <HI>And
is this glorious King that Iesus Christ whom we
heard so much spoken of when we lived upon the
Earth? Was he indeed so great whose commands we
<PB N="63" REF="36">
disobeyed, whose threatnings we slighted, whose grace
we abused, and whose wrath we dis-regarded? Was it
so excellent a person, who was described and set forth
to us by Ministers in such superlative expressions,
all which he exceeds? and yet could we see no form,
nor comeliness in him, nothing for which we should
desire him? Was this the Saviour that was preached to
us, and proffered to us? This the Iesus Christ that
we were pressed so frequently and so earnestly to get an
interest in, with so many powerfull arguments, and yet
could not be moved and perswaded? Was it this Per|son
that did call us, and stretch forth his hand all the
day long to us, that did wooe us, and intreat us
by his messengers, to accept of parden, and grace, and
salvation, and knock at the door of our hearts again
and again, by his Word and Spirit for entertainment?
and did we shut our ear and our heart against him,
and refuse all his gracious tenders which were made
unto us? What, did we hearken to the Devil when he
tempted us to sin, that he might destroy us; and not
hearken to Christ, who would have perswaded us to
faith and obedience, that he might save us? Could
we harbour base lusts, which were like so many vipers
in our bosoms, and give no entertainment to Iesus
Christ, who would have brought riches and glory with
him? O what fools &amp; mad men and women have we been!
How have our cursed hearts deceived us, and the devil
deluded us? How have we been bewitched, to prefer
the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nities of the World, and the satisfaction of the
desires of our flesh, before an interest in such a Savi|our?
Wo! wo! wo! be unto us, for now the great day

appear to be the Prince and Lord of glory; and
be admired not only by the Saints, but also
by the wicked, amongst whom, before they saw
him, he was despised. The <HI>despisers</HI> shall <HI>behold</HI>
the lustre of their Judge, <HI>and wonder, and perish,</HI>
as it is said in another case, <HI>Act.</HI> 13. 41. Christ
will be most glorious in regard of his retinue; all
the holy Angels, those glorious Spirits who are
about the Throne of God, shall attend upon him,
<HI>Matth. 25. 31. When the Son of Man cometh in his
glory, and all his holy Angels with him;</HI> yea, all the
holy Saints also, shall attend upon him in the
judgment of the wicked, <HI>Iude 14. 15. Behold the
Lord will come with ten thousand of his Saints to exe|cure
judgment upon all the ungodly, &amp;c.</HI> Yea, he will
<PB N="66" REF="38">
come with all his Saints, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3. 13. The whole
innumerable company of Saints shall attend upon
Christ in white shining garments, with bodies
like unto Christ, more beautiful and glorious, than
the most splendid attire can make them; and
Christ then will be admired in all the Saints and
believers, by the wicked which shall behold them:
And Christ will sit upon the Throne of his glory,
<HI>Matth. 25. 31. I saw a great white Throne, and him
that sate on it, from whose face the Earth and the
Heaven fled away, Rev. 20. 11.</HI> We read of a glo|rious
Throne which <HI>Solomon</HI> made, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 10. 18,
19, 20. But the Throne and Tribunal seat of
Christ will be far more glorious than <HI>Solomons,</HI> or
any Monarchs that ever lived upon the face of the
earth.</P>
<P>2. Christ will be a most <HI>powerful</HI> Judge: He
will have power to raise all the wicked out of their
graves unto life again; which requires as much
power to effect, as the giving them their being and
life at the first: he will have power to bring all
the wicked to his foot, to keep them in awe, that
they shall not stir, nor lift up the hand in the
least, in a way of rebellion; which is more than
the most potent Prince that ever lived could do:
He will have power to execute vengeance upon
all the wicked together, and inflict an infinite pu|nishment
upon them; and he will put forth no
less power in the destruction of the wicked at the
last day, than was put forth in the first creation of
the world; herein he will <HI>make his power known,
Rom. 9. 22.</HI> When the wicked shall <HI>be punished
with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the
Lord, and from the glory of his power,</HI> 2 Thes. 1. 9.</P>
<P>3. Christ will be a most <HI>knowing</HI> Judge: He
<PB N="67" REF="38">
will know all the persons of the wicked; not one
shall scape his eye; he will not know them in any
way of nearness, and familiar acquainting him|self
with them; but he will know them in a way
of perfect cognizance of their persons; he knew
them when they lived and rebelled against his
Law; and he will know them again, when they
are raised; he will not only have a general know|ledge
of them, but he will know them particu|larly:
none of the ancient rebels shall be able to
hide themselves, either under rocks and moun|tains,
or in the crowd and throng of the wicked
which shall be gathered together before him on
that day; Christ will finde out all his enemies:
and he will know all their crimes; he will read
them all written in the book of Gods remem|brance;
and the book of their own consciences
being then opened, will present all their sins to
his view; the eye of the Judge will be a piercing,
all-seeing eye, which cannot be blinded, and
therefore there will be no mistake and errour in
the judgment, through ignorance or false informa|tion,
as there may be in the Courts of judicature
upon the earth.</P>
<P>4. Christ will be a most <HI>holy</HI> Judge: He will be
without any the least stain of sin; he was so when
he lived amongst sinners on earth, and surely he
will be so, when he descendeth from the Holy of
Holies in Heaven: some earthly Judges are guilty
in the same kind with the malefactors which are
brought before them; so that whilst they judge
others they condemn themselves: but there will
not be the least more of sin in the eye of Christ;
nor any tincture of defilement; and therefore as
it will be impossible to blind him, because of his
<PB N="68" REF="39">
knowledge: so it will be impossible to bribe and
corrupt him in judgment, because of his holiness;
and by consequence.</P>
<P>5 Christ will be a most <HI>impartial and strict</HI> Judge:
he will be most impartial in regard of the persons
whom he will judge; the high degree and qua|lity
of men upon the earth will be of no account
with him; the rich will be no more regarded than
the poor; nor the highest Princes more than the
meanest of their subjects; Death levels all men,
and puts a conclusion unto all earthly dignities;
and in the resurrection all will stand upon even
ground: now some Lords and great men may
murder, and oppress, and break Laws, and through
favour escape punishment, which crimes, if mea|ner
persons had been found guilty of, would have
cost them their lives: but Christ will have no
more favour for a Lord, or a Knight, or a Gentle|man,
no nor for a King or a Queen, or the greatest
Lady, than for the most contemptible beggar; he
will not accept of the persons of any, and con|nive
at the sins of some, which those that should
reprove them now can wink at, as if they were
no faults; because the faults of such persons as
are high, whose favour they desire, and from
whom they might receive damage and dis-esteem
should they be plain and faithful; but Christ he will
neither need the favour nor fear the anger of anyl;
&amp; he will not court and flatter any because of their
Nobility and greatness; but impartially judge the
highest and greatest, by the same rule as he will do
the lowest and meanest; and Christ will be a
most strict Judge in regard of crimes; he will
bring forth all the sins of the wicked to light; not
one sin which they have committed from the day
<PB N="69" REF="39">
of their birth to the hour of their dissolution, but
shall be had in remembrance, and be brought
unto publick view, when the Lord shall enter
into judgement with the ungodly world: some of
the wicked do now sin more secretly, they have
sweet morsels rolling under their tongues, which
are not perceived; they have their <HI>Dalilahs</HI> in
corners, who are not known; they shroud them|selves
under the shadow of the wings of the night,
that they might conceal some of their wicked leud
practices, which, should they be found out in,
would fill their cheeks with shame &amp; blushing: but
Christ will call them at the last day to a strict ac|count,
<HI>and bring to light the hidden things of darkness,
1 Cor.</HI> 4. 5. And O the contempt &amp; confusion which
they will be covered withall when all their shame|ful
and abominable sins shall be made manifest.</P>
<P>6. Christ will be a most <HI>righteous</HI> Judge: he
will judge the wicked in righteousness; some of
them will be found to have been unrighteous in
their judgments; and others righteous in their
dealings; and all of them unrighteous in their
state; but Christ will judge them all in righ|teousness:
he will judge them according to their
works: as he will be righteous in not inflicting
upon them a greater punishment than their sins
have deserved, he will not punish lesser sinners
with more stripes, and greater sinners with fewer
stripes: so neither will he be unrighteous in in|flicting
upon them a lesser punishment than their
sins have deserved; but will proportion their pu|nishment
to their offence, <HI>Rev. 18. 7. How much
she hath glorified her self, and lived deliciously, so
much torment and sorrow give her.</HI> Christ will be
exactly righteous in his judgment, severely righ|teous,
<PB N="70" REF="40">
without the least mixture of mercy; the
wicked shall have from him the <HI>summum jus,</HI>
and that <HI>sine ull&agrave; injuri&acirc;,</HI> they shall have the
highest right and justice, without the least injury;
Gods justice requires satisfaction for their sins,
and Christ will satisfie the demands of justice to
the full upon the ungodly, by distribution of such
punishments as are the just desert of their sins;
Christ will even all scores at that day&punc; between
God and sinners; at least he will begin to take
the payment of that debt from them which they
owe for sin, which they will be paying unto all
eternity. Christ will come with the Ballances and
Sword of Justice in his hand, he will come to take
just vengeance upon disobedient sinners.</P>
<P>7. Christ will be a most <HI>furious</HI> Judge: he will be
most gracious towards the righteous, but most
furious against the wicked. <HI>He will come in flaming
fire, to take vengeance upon them, 2 Thes. 1. 8.</HI> He
will come in <HI>flames of love</HI> towards his people;
but in <HI>flames of anger</HI> against his enemies; a Fire
shall devour before him, and, it will be very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">em|pestuous
round about him; see <HI>Isa. 66. 15. Behold
the Lord will come with Fire, and with his Chariots,
as with a whirl-wind, to render his anger with fury,
his rebukes with flames <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f Fire.</HI> We read of such
wrath on that day in the Lamb, as maketh the
Kings and great men of the earth to tremble, and
call to mountains and rocks to fall on them and
hide them f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">om it&punc; <HI>Rev. 6. 15, 16, 17.</HI> Never was
there greater love, and more tender bowels of
compassion and pitty, than is to be found now in
the Lord Jesus Christ, towards all them that apply
themselves unto him, under a sense of sin, for sal|vation,
here in this world; and never was there
<PB N="71" REF="40">
greater wrath and revengeful fury, than will be
found in the same Lord Jesus Christ, when sin|ners
shall come before him to be judged at the
last day; He will be very furious, ten thousand
times beyond a Beare when she is bereaved of her
whelps, or a Lion when he is hunger-starved;
How fiercely will Christ look upon the wicked?
What scorn and contempt of them will they see
in his face? What dreadful frowns in his brow?
What fiery anger will there sparkle from his eye,
in his looking upon them, as if he would look
them dead, or look them into Hell, before he hath
pronounced the sentence? How fiercely will he
speak unto them? There will be terrour in his
looks, and there will be terrour in his voice: he
will speak to them in his wrath, and vex them
in his hot displeasure. His anger then will break
forth into a flame; he will appeare to be jealous
and very furious, when he cometh to execute ven|geance
on his adversaries, and punish his enemies
for their sins.</P>
<P>8. Christ will be an <HI>inexorable</HI> Judge. None is
now more easie to be entreated as a Saviour;
whosoever comes unto him may be welcome to
him; he hath promised in no wise to cast out
such, <HI>Ioh. 6. 37.</HI> The most rebellious sinners may
finde entertainment with Jesus Christ now; and
prevail with him to procure pardon, and peace,
and salvation, upon their repentance of their sins:
but when he is come down from Heaven to judge
the world, he will be inexorable; No prayers or
intreaties; no tears or arguments will in the least
move him to take any pitty on such as shall then
be found in their sins. When the wicked at the
day of judgment shall have their eyes opened to
<PB N="72" REF="41">
behold the Lord Jesus Christ in his glory and
Majesty, in such excellency and shining beauty;
then one smile of his countenance will be really
accounted of more worth than the whole world;
and to be made like to such a person, and to
dwell for ever in his love and joy, they will
then clearly see to be unconceiveably beyond all
the enjoyment of the creatures in their fullest
delights; and to be thrust out of his presence
they will account their chiefest misery: then they
will have other apprehensions of Hells torments,
when they are just ready to be cast into the bur|ning
lake; when they are awakened in the mor|ning
of the resurrection, and are brought to Christs
bar, and they perceive how neer they are to exe|cution;
and great distress will be upon them,
when they look about them, and all refuge fails,
and they see no way for them to escape; If now
with their cries and supplications they might pre|vail
with the Judge for some commiseration, if
they had but the least hopes of moving his bow|els,
and pacifying his anger, and obtaining the
favour of admission into the inheritance of the
Saints; O how would they all fall down upon
their knees before him with the lowest submission
and reverence? how would they cry and weep,
intreat and beseech? how would they kiss his
feet, wash them with their tears, and wipe them
with their hairs? how earnest and importunate
would they be with him for a pardon, if importu|nity
would prevaile? If there were but one pro|mise
left in the whole Book of God for them, which
might possibly bring unto them some relief; how
greedily would they all catch at it, and humbly
wooe the Lord for mercy? No, no, the Judge
<PB N="73" REF="41">
will then be inexorable: they may cry, but it will
be to no purpose; he will shut his eares against
their prayers, and hide his eyes from their misery;
they had promises enough whilst they lived, but
they did not regard them, they did not believe and
apply them; and now nothing but threatnings be|long
to them, and remain for them; Christ often
cryed to them by his Ministers, and moved them
by his spirit to open the Door of their hearts, and
give him room and entertainment; but they shut
their eares and hearts against him; and now Christ
will shut his eares, and the door of mercy, and
Heaven against them. He will be inexorable.
Thus concerning the Judge of the wicked.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The Assessors, or those which shall sit with Christ
in the judgment of the wicked, will be the righteous.</HI>
This promise the Lord makes particularly and e|specially
to the twelve Apostles, <HI>Matth. 19. 28.
Verily I say unto you, that yee which have followed
me</HI> (that have denied your selves, and parted
with all, and taken up your Cross, and followed
me) <HI>in the Regeneration,</HI> (or restitution of all things,
when the Day of Resurrection doth come) <HI>and the
Son of Man shall sit on the Throne of his Glory,</HI>
(when I shall sit upon my judgment Seat, and ga|ther
all Nations before my Bar, to receive their
doom) <HI>Yee shall sit on twelve Thrones, Iudging the
twelve Tribes of Israel,</HI> and though the Apostles of
Christ will be especially honoured, and exalted in
the day of Judgment, and have seates, or degrees
of dignity above others; yet this honour also shall
all the Saints have, to sit with Christ in Judgment,
<HI>1 Cor. 6. 2. Do yee not know that the Saints shall
judge the World?</HI> They judge and condemn the sins
<PB N="74" REF="42">
of the wicked World now, by their holy conversa|tion;
and they will judge and condemn the per|sons
of the wicked at the last day, by their appro|bation
of Christs Judgment. The crimes of the
wicked will be scan'd before the righteous; their
secret sins will be ript up and made manifest unto
them; they will not only be brought in as accu|sers
and witnesses against some of the wicked, of
which I shall speak by and by; but also they will
joyn with Christ in the examination of all the
wicked; and they will also approve of Christs ju|stice
and righteousness in the condemning of sin|ners
for their sins, and when Christ doth pronounce
the sentence of condemnation upon them, <HI>Depart
from me yee cursed into everlasting Fire prepared for
the Devil and his Angels,</HI> they will joyn with him,
and approve of this sentence; it may be they will
with one voice say, <HI>even so Amen:</HI> or with a loud
shout accompany Christs words, saying, <HI>Depart
yee cursed into everlasting Fire.</HI> A strange turn and
change of things will there be at that day; <HI>Felix,</HI>
who sate on the Judgment Seat, when <HI>Paul</HI> was at
the Bar, will stand at the Bar when <HI>Paul</HI> shall sit
amongst the Judges. The Lord will bring down
the mighty from their seats, and all wicked Prin|ces
and Judges of the Earth shall be dis-throned,
when the righteous, though of a low degree, shall
be exalted to sit as Judges upon them.</P>
<P>3. <HI>The Malefactors which shall be judged, will be,</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>Devils. 2 Pet. 2. 4.</HI> The Angels which
fell, are said to be <HI>delivered into Chains of dark|ness,
and to be reserved unto Iudgment;</HI> they are pu|nished
in part now, but their punishment is not
yet compleat; when Christ came the first time in
<PB N="75" REF="42">
the flesh, and began to dis-lodge the Devils from
their habitation, in those Persons whom they had
got the possession of, they were afraid that he
would have compleated their torment presently;
and therefore they cry out, <HI>Art thou come hither to
torment us before the time? Matth. 8. 29.</HI> And <HI>let us
alone, art thou come to destroy us? Mark 1. 24.</HI>
But when Christ comes the second time in his glory;
then he will judge and condemn the wicked An|gels;
and the Saints shall joyn with him herein,
<HI>I Cor. 6. 3. Know yee not that we shall judge An|gels?</HI>
Then the measure of their sin will be com|pleated,
and the time of their torment will be
come, and their punishment shall be compleated
too; the way and manner of their Judgment is
not spoken of in Scripture, and therefore I shall
not speak of it; but that they shall be judged to
everlasting Fire, is evident from the sentence pro|nounced
on wicked men, in which it is said, that
everlasting Fire is prepared for the Devil and his
Angels.</P>
<P>2. <HI>All wicked Men and Women,</HI> that ever li|ved,
or shall live on the Earth from the beginning
of the Creation, unto the dissolution of the World,
that have no Interest in Jesus Christ, will be the
malefactors, which shall be judged by Christ at
the last day; this day is called the <HI>day of Iudgment
and perdition of the ungodly. 2 Pet. 3. 7.</HI> And the
unjust are said to be <HI>reserved unto the day of judg|ment
to be punished, Chap. 2. Vers. 9.</HI> And the A|postle
<HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that <HI>the Lord Iesus shall be
revealed from Heaven in flaming Fire, taking ven|geance
on them which know not God, and obey not the
G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">spel, 2 Thess. 1. 7, 8.</HI></P>
<P>1. By them which know not God, we may un|derstand
<PB N="76" REF="43">
the Heathen and Gentile Nations, this
being the Character given of them, 1 <HI>Thess. 4. 5.
Not in lusts of concupiscence, as the Gentiles which
know not God.</HI> And the <HI>Ephesians</HI> whilst Heathens
before the Gospel came amongst them, were
<HI>strangers to the Covenant of Promise, having no hope,
and without God in the World, Eph. 2. 12.</HI> All the
Heathen Nations shall be judged by Christ; but
I shall not speak of their judgment, in which we
are not so much concerned.</P>
<P>2. By them which obey not the Gospel, we
are to understand all those Nations upon whom the
light of the Gospel hath shin'd, and unto whom
the sound of the Gospel hath come; but yet have
not yielded obedience therunto, so as heertily to
accept of Christ for their Saviour upon his own
tearmes; all Christless, graceless Persons, who
have heard of Christ, and enjoyed the means of
grace, will be the chief Malefactors in the day
of Judgment. I might here give a Catalogue of
the sinners which shall be judged, take one in
1 <HI>Cor. 6. 9, 10. The unrighteous, fornicators, Idola|ters,
Adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with
Mankind, Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Revilers,
Extortioners, and all other unjustified, unsanctified
sinners.</HI> But more of this when I come to speak
of the conviction of the wicked.</P>
<P>4. The Crime for which the wicked shall be judged,
and condemned by Christ, will be sin.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Sin against the Law,</HI> and that 1. for sins of
<HI>omission, Matth. 25. 42. I was an hungred, and ye
gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no
drink, &amp;c.</HI> 2. for sins of <HI>commission,</HI> and that 1.
for sins of <HI>thought and heart, 1 Cor. 4. 5. When the
<PB N="77" REF="43">
Lord comes, he will make manifest the counsels of the
heart,</HI> he will condemn men for their wicked
thoughts and contrivements, for their sinful lusts
and desires, and delights. 2. For sins of <HI>word,
Matth. 12. 36, 37. But I say unto you, that every
idle word, that Men shall speak, they shall give an
account thereof in the day of Iudgment: For by thy
words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt&punc;
be condemned.</HI> If for idle words men shall be
judged; much more for taking Gods name in vain,
for hideous Oaths and Blasphemies; if for unpro|fitable
speeches, much more for corrupt communi|cation,
for lying, slanderous, bitter, reviling spee|ches.
3. Christ will judge the wicked for their
sins of <HI>deed. Rom. 2. 6. He will render to every one
according to their deeds.</HI> And vers. 8, 9. <HI>To them that
obey unrighteousness, indignation, and wrath, tribulati|on,
and anguish upon every soul of Man that doth evil,
of the Iew first, and also of the Gentile.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>The sins against the Gospel,</HI> will be the chief
condemning crimes of the wicked. No sins against
the Law will be found so heinous, but if sinners
be found after the commission of them to have o|beyed
the Gospel, to have repented, and believed,
and yielded the fruits of new obedience; they
will have a pardon and absolution on that day;
but final disobedience to the Gospel will be un|pardonable;
final impenitency, and unbelief in
those which have been called to repent, and to
close with Jesus Christ will certainly bring men
under the sentence of condemnation; I might here
give a more particular Catalogue of the sins which
the wicked shall be judged for by Christ, but some|thing
more of them under their conviction by
Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="44">
5. <HI>The accusers of, and witnesses against the wicked,</HI>
being the same, I shall joyn them together, and
they will be, 1. <HI>God. 2. Men. 3. Devils.
4. Themselves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>1. God will be an accuser of, and witness against
the wicked,</HI> at the day of judgment.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Gods</HI> justice (<HI>to speak after the manner of
men, seeing this judgment is set forth in such a
manner, for our better apprehending of it, because
we are not able to conceive in this state the way
exactly of Gods proceeding against sinners in
Judgment on that day) will arraign the wicked be|fore
the judgment seat of Christ, and draw up as
it were a Bill of Indictment against them.</HI> Where|as
these Men and Women who lived in such and such
places, and times; though they were my Creatures and
subjects; were made by me and for me; and I gave
them my holy and righteous, and good Law, to be the
guide and rule of their life and actions; yet having
no fear of me before their eyes; they did shake off my
yoke, and break my Laws, they did cast my Comman|dements
behind their back, and lived in a course of re|bellion
and disobedience against me; committing such
and such sins: And when I sent my Son into the
World to die for sinners, who gave me sufficient sa|tisfaction;
and I made him known, and the way of
salvation by him, and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ffered him unto them, and
entreated them by my Embassadors to be reconciled;
but they shut their ear, and hardened their heart, and
refused my Son; trampled upon his blood; grieved
my spirit; and neglected the salvation of their own
souls; therefore I now require satisfaction from them|selves,
and that a condigne punishment be inflicted up|on
them, for their disobedience.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="44">
2. <HI>Gods</HI> goodness, <HI>and</HI> bounty, <HI>and</HI> patience <HI>will
accuse them, when they are thus arraigned and in|dicted
by his justice, which will aggravate their
sins:</HI> I nourished and brought up these creatures like
children; and yet they rebelled against me; I spared
them, as a Man spareth his Son, which serveth him;
and yet they had no regard of me; I delivered them
in six troubles, and in seven; recovered them often
from a sick Bed; and brought them back from the
Grave, when they were ready to go down into the Pit;
and yet they knew not that I healed them, and were so
much the more disobedient unto me; I loaded them with
mercies, and yet they loaded me with iniquities; I
would have led them to repentance by my patience and
goodness, but they were the more impenitent and hard-hearted,
and resolved to do evil; I stretched forth my
hand all the day long to these disobedient and gain-say|ing
Creatures, and would have received them, had
they returned into the armes of my mercy; but nothing
would win and perswade them to leave their sins, and
come unto me; and now my patience is spent, and long-suffering
is at an end, and bowels shut up against them
for ever; and let them now smart for all their abuses,
affronts, and contempts, which they have offered un|to
me.</P>
<P>3. <HI>God's</HI> omniscience <HI>will be a witness against
the wicked at the day of Judgment; their sins
have been all committed under the view of God's
all-seeing eye; and they have been noted down
upon the Book of his Remembrance; and God
will witness against them:</HI> I saw these wretched sin|ners
when they were b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rn, and traced all their steps;
I compassed their path, and their lying down, and was
acquainted with all their waies; I did beset them be|hinde
and before, and mine eye was continually upon
<PB N="80" REF="45">
them; I perceived the first sproutings and buddings of
sin in their tender years; I took notice of their dis|obedience
to their Parents, when they were young; of
their lies, and pride, and vanity, of their idleness and
sloath, and mis-spending their precious time: I was an
eye-witness to all their sins, from their youth to their
dying hour; I beheld them when no eye besides was upon
them; I saw their privy lewdness, and all their deeds
of darkness, which they committed in dark corners:
when I kept silence and did not speak, I was not blinde
so as not to see; and although I did not smite, I did
note: and what one of them all have the confidence to
deny any one of their sins which I have been a witness
unto? <HI>The first accuser and witness against the
wicked will be God himself.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Men will accuse and witness against the wicked</HI>
at the day of Judgment, and that both the <HI>Godly</HI>
and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ngodly.</HI></P>
<P>1. The <HI>Godly,</HI> and that both <HI>Godly Ministers,</HI>
and <HI>Godly Friends,</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>Godly Ministers,</HI> will be the accusers and
witnesses against the wicked. Ministers must
give an account then to their Lord of the souls
which he committed to their charge, <HI>Heb. 13. 17.</HI>
And in some of their Flock they will rejoyce, be|cause
their testimony concerning Jesus Christ was
believed; because the Gospel which they preach|ed
amongst them was obeyed; because the Word
was received as the Word of God; they will re|joyce
in them which have been effectually wrought
upon by their Ministry; in those which they have
been instrumental to regenerate and espouse un|to
Jesus Christ; to perswade to leave their sins,
and submit themselves unto the yoke and Scepter
of the Lord; such will be the joy and crown of
<PB N="81" REF="45">
rejoycing to their Ministers on that day; of whom
with unspeakable comfort they will say to their
Lord, <HI>Behold the Children which thou hust given us,
Thine they were and are, and thou didst give them unto
us, and they have believed and kept thy word; and now
as they have shared in thy Grace, let them and us share
in, and participate of thy Glory.</HI> But alas! what a
sad account will they have to give of others of
their Flock, who have not believed and yielded
obedience to the Gospel, which they have preach|ed;
it will be sad for them, when they must bring
in heavy accusations against them. <HI>Lord thou didst
send us upon thy Embassage unto them; but they regard|ed
neither Messenger, nor Message; we preached often
in thy Name, but either they would not hear when they
might, or they would not believe and yield obedience
when they heard: we often told them of their sins, and
foretold them of their danger, if they did not repent
and reform; but they would not receive conviction, nor
be perswaded to repentance and reformation; if we
spake of sin more generally, they did not look upon them|selves
as concerned, and made no Application, except
it were to others: if we came more home and close, they
shrouded their sins as close as they could under the Vaile
of some thin excuses; they shut their eyes and would
not see; and if the beames of light brake in upon them,
and in a start they opened their eies a little; they were
either offended, that we should disturb them in their
sleep, or they quicklie shut their eies again, and dropt
asleep faster than before; and soon wore off the convi|ctions
and troubles of minde which sometimes they have
had under the light and allarme of thy word. We oft|en
shewed them their face in the Glass, but they have
gone away and forgotten what manner of Men and
Women they were: we have told them of the workes of
<PB N="82" REF="46">
the flesh, which would certainly exclude them the king|dome
of Heaven,</HI> Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. <HI>That no un|righteous
Person, nor unclean Person, nor Drunkard,
nor covetous Person, nor Reviler, nor Extortioner,
could be saved, without Repentance and Sanctification:</HI>
I Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. <HI>And yet they would not leave
their sins; they would be unjust and unclean still;
they would be covetous and revilers still; they would
wallow still in their filthiness, and hold fast their sin,
whatever we could speak against it. We preached unto
them of the day of Iudgment, and foretold them out
of thy Word, of these very things which are now come to
p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ss; but they did not believe it, nor consider it, nor
take any care to prepare for this day; they thrust the
thoughts of judgment out of their minde, and put the
evil day far from them. We preached unto them the
Gospel, opened the rich treasures thereof before them,
made known the exceeding great and precious promises
of the Covenant of Grace, the inestimable priviledges
and unspeakable benefits, which belong to those that be|long
to Christ; and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ffered all unto them in thy name
if they would accept of them, and yield obedience unto
thee; but all these things were slighted and undervalu|ed
by them. We called and cryed, we beseeched and
entreated them that they would be reconciled unto God;
but they would not give ear unto us. We held thee forth,
Lord, to them, and studied to set thee forth in the best
words we could think of; told them of thy beauty and
love, and desirableness above all Persons and things in
the World; told them of their need, and that they were
undone without thee: tendered to them thy blood, and
the purchase thereof, pardon and peace, and happinesse
for ever; but they were like the deaf Adder which will
not hear, they were like Rocks unmoved, they refused
thee and thy treasures, trampled upon thy blood, and
<PB N="83" REF="46">
put both us and thee to shame by their refusal: we in|vited
them unto the marriage Feast, but they would not
come; all excus'd themselves with one consent; one
had bought a Farm, and he must see it; another was
engaged in a great Trade, and he must follow it; a|nother
had married a Wife, and he could not, and none
of them would come, and taste of thy Banquet; the
cares of the World, the deceitfulness of riches, the
pleasures of this life, and the lusts of other things, did
so overcharge their thoughts and hearts, that the Gospel
and rich provisiens thereof lay by disregarded.</HI></P>
<P>Such will be the accusations of some Ministers;
such witness must they give at the last day against
those of their Flock, who shall be found in the
number of the wicked and disobedient to the Go|spel;
then their Sermons, now forgotten, will be
remembred, and be so many evidences against
them; O that our People would remember them
now! O that they would now consider, and believe,
and turn, and live, and avoid the accusations and
witness, which otherwise we must be forced to give
in then against them.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>godly friends</HI> of the wicked will be their
accusers, and witness against them; some of them
are linked in neer Relations to the godly, who now
are endeavouring to be instrumental for their sal|vation;
but if they do not prevail, they will here|after
be their accusers and witnesses for their con|demnation.</P>
<P><HI>I. The believing Husband will then accuse and
witness against his unbelieving Wife,</HI> Lord she
lay in my bosome, and was beloved by me as my self; I
cherished her, and was as tender of her as my own flesh,
according to thy command; but all my love and kinde|ness
to her could not win her heart for thee: I told
<PB N="84" REF="47">
her often of thy beauty, and thy love which was a thou|sand
fold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eyond what I, or any Man alive could pos|sibly
express; but she was stupid and unbelieving,
and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lly disregarded both thy Person and
thy love: I covered her faults with love, as much
as I could, from others; and used many entreaties and
loving perswasions to draw her to amendment; telling
her the danger and destructive issue of a sinfull course;
but she would not hearken to amend; her heart was set
upon sin and vanity; she was proud and foolish; she
was wanton and froward, and would not be reclaimed:
she did see my grief and sorrow for sin, she was a
witness to my teares and mournful complaints; and yet
she could bear up under greater guilt without any sense:
she did see me often retire into my Closet, and knew
that I spent time daily between me and thee alone;
and yet, though her need was as great, she would not be
perswaded to an imitation: I have often in the secret
silent night, when sleep hath fled from both our eyes,
taken advantage of such opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rtunities to discourse with
her about her sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">-affaires; told her of the sleep of death
which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re long would seize upon us; the night we must
stend in the Grave; of the morning of the Resurrection;
of thy second coming, and our appearing before thy Tri|bunal
Seat; but nothing would quicken her to make
preparation for Death and Iudgment, she heard as if
she were asleep, as indeed she was asleep whilst awake,
and dead whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st she was alive, asleep and dead in sin
and security.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The believing Wife will then accuse her
unbelieving Husband.</HI> Lord thou knowest how I
loved, and honoured, and reverenced, and obeyed him
in lawful things, and was faithful to him according to
my duty; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ut he would not love and honour thee, he
was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nfaithfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, and would not obey thy m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re reasonable
<PB N="85" REF="47">
commands, unto whom he owed a greater subjection:
I have often sate alone like a widdow at home, when
he hath been revelling abroad with his companions:
I have been pouring forth tears for him, at the Throne
of grace in my Closet, when he hath been pouring in
Wine and strong drink in Taverns and Aie-houses:
I have been troubled for him, when he hath staied our
so late; and troubled more with him, when he hath
come in so full of drink, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ssion; and with much
patience have endured his foul speeches and behaviour,
which he hath used: I have watched the most fit op|portunity
I could take, to put him in mind of his sin and
danger; and I have done it with the greatest humi|lity
and meeknes, and tender affection as I could; but
either he hath not regarded my words; or slew out into
a rage against me: O how fain would I have per|swaded
him to draw in the same yoke of Christ with
me; but he would draw another way, do what I could;
none of my prayers, nor tears, nor arguments, no, not
the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ve of Christ, nor the love of his own soul, could
prevaile with him to change his course; he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
leave his drunkenness, and adultery, his worldliness
and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">justice, his lying and over-reaching, his swearing
and bitterness against thy people, by no means would he
be perswaded.</P>
<P>3. Believing Parents will then accuse and
witness against their ungodly children, and ser|vants:</P>
<P>Lord, we endeavoured to bring them up in the nur|ture
and admonition of thee; we laboured to put good
principles betimes into them; we dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pped many whol|some
instructions upon them; we prayed frequently for
them, and with them, and spake plainly a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d earnest|ly
to them about their soul-concernment; we told them
of the immnr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">atity of their s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uls, the preciousness of
<PB N="86" REF="48">
their time, the evil of sin, their need of thee, the
excellency of grace, their danger of Hell, the way to
escape it, the glory of Heaven, the way to attain it;
but alas, to the grief of our hearts, they shut their ears
against all our instructions, and would take none of our
reproofs or counsels, they would go foolishly and stubborn|ly
on in a course of sin, and neither thy law, nor our fear
would restrain them.</P>
<P>Thus these and other godly relations will rise
up in judgment, and witness against the wicked.</P>
<P>3. <HI>The ungodly friends and companions of the
wicked will at that day be their accusers and witness
against them;</HI> especially those who have been
drawn by them into sin; however now they are
very well pleased with them, and delight in their
company, because sin pleaseth them, and they
do not feel nor believe the bitterness which will
be consequent; yet when they come to be judged,
and punished for those sins, they will with rage
and madness accuse, &amp; curse those wicked persons
which were their first tempters: Drunkards will
accuse those that drew them first into Taverns,
and Ale-houses, and perswaded them by healths,
and other waies to drink beyond their measure;
Adulterers and Adulteresses will accuse those
which first inticed them unto privy lewdness: un|godly
servants also will then accuse their wicked
masters, and ungodly children their wicked pa|rents,
who have been drawn into sin by their ex|ample.
Thus men will be accusers and witnesses
against the wicked,</P>
<P><HI>3. Devils will be the Accusers and Witnesses a|gainst
the wicked;</HI> they are now accusers of the
brethren, then they will be accusers of the wic|ked;
they accuse the brethren falsly, they will
<PB N="87" REF="48">
accuse the wicked truly; now they please and
flatter the wicked, and perswade them to sin;
then they will accuse them for those very sins
which they have perswaded them unto; they have
done the devils drudgery all their daies, and been
his faithful slaves; and this is his recompence, he
will be their accuser at the last day.</P>
<P>4. <HI>The wicked will be accused by themselves, their
own thoughts shall accuse them in the day when God
shall judge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ, Rom.</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 15, 16. their own consciences will accuse them,
and be as a thousand witnesses against them; they
will finde all their sins registred in that book, and
that book will then be opened, and they will
not be able to deny one word of what they shall
finde there recorded. Thus of the accusers and
witnesses against the wicked.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Concerning the Conviction.</HI> And here I shall
speak of the conviction of some particular sinners;
especially of such who have lived in the daies
and places, where the Gospel hath been preach|ed,
whom the Lord Iesus Christ with upbraiding
having of full evidence with convict of their sins.
To set this out the more lively.</P>
<P>Suppose that this very day were the day of
Judgment; and in this very Church were the
Judgment-feat; that here were a great white
Throne, and the Lord Jesus Christ himself sitting
upon it in his glory, with millions of holy An|gels
about him, and all the Saints in white at his
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ight hand; and on his left, all the wicked gathered
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ogether into one body, as it will be at the last
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ay; And the Judge should cry with a loud voice,
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ring the prisoners to the Bar, Bring the sinners to judg|ment,
<PB N="88" REF="49">
and so summon and convict particular sinners.</HI></P>

you chose such as would give you more scope, and liberty,

gave Sathan one hold, that it would not be sufficient to
undo you? had you stuck close to my Ministry and Or|dinances,

did you not finde how wavering and unsteady you were,
how like Children tossed too and fro with every

which I appointed for your establishment? did you con|ceit
that you might live above Ordinances in the World?
did you imagine to get into a higher forme, when you

when you fancied a clearer light, were not you
most full of darkness? when you thought your selves so
holy, as none like you, and none must be holy but those
of your way; were not you most unholy, and like a

out of the way of my Ordinances and Institutions?
when you thought your selves must guided and acted by

truth were evil spoken of by evil Men? were not
those without prejudiced against my very wayes, because
of your delusions, which made so forward a profession?
suppose I permitted some of mine to mistake in circum|stantials,

your selves some things, were they those things that I

did you know what a snare you were hampered in, so
soon as you put your foot into the way of errour, and

Heaven? were not you in a greater unlikelihood of

you were more forward to reprove my Mini|sters,

from them; you could call them Antichristian, and
false Prophets, though they adheared to and maintained
nothing, but the truths of my word; and when I gave
them so many seals of their Ministry in the conversion
of many Souls; you could call them self-seekers and
hirelings, though they gave such evidences of self-denial,
and many of them forsook all that they had,
rather than they would make a breach upon their consci|ences;

<P>Christ at the day of Judgment will convict the
whole ungodly World, especially those who have
lived under the sound of the Gospel; their crimes
will be made manifest and evident, and every

wicked will be speechless and stand after their full

the Judge: And think now with your selves what
the behaviour of the wicked will be, when they
are thus convicted of their sins, and are ready to

found them guilty, and the Judge hath been pro|ceeding

<ITEM>3. The aggravations, or vexing considerations, which
Gospel-sinners will have in their going away.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>1. From whom the wicked shall go away.</P>
<P>1. <HI>They shall go away from Iesus Christ;</HI> the
righteous are at his side, and shall remain with
him; but the wicked shall go away from him;
the righteous shall go with him, and abide with
him, where he is, there they shall be also; they
shall be for ever with the Lord; but the wicked,
must go away, and be eternally separated from
his presence. The righteous shall behold his
glory, and share in it; they shall see the smiles
of his face, and be entertained by him with un|expressible
love; but the wicked shall be thrust
<PB N="119" REF="64">
out of his presence with frowns and indignation;
it will be one great part of the misery of the wick|ed,
that they shall go away from so glorious a per|son
as the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>2. <HI>They shall go away from the Saints;</HI> now some
of them are mingled with Gods people, the
Tares and the Wheat grow up together; the
sheep and the goats feed in the same pasture; and
though it was bitter to the wicked to dwell with
the righteous, because of the contradiction,
which was in their lives, to their lusts; yet then
it will be more bitter to them to be excluded
their society, because then they will perceive
their excellency with admiration: when they see
them shine with such beauty, and rejoyce with
Songs of triumph, and they must be gone away
from them; this will fill their hearts with racking
envy, and torment them unspeakably.</P>
<P>2. <HI>From what the wicked shall go away;</HI> they
shall go away from happiness, from the happi|ness
of heaven; the doors of heaven shall be
shut upon them; they shall see <HI>Abraham,</HI> and
<HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob,</HI> and many come from the East,
and the West, and the North, and the South, even
an innumerable multitude of all kindreds, and
Nations, and Tongues, and enter in and sit down
in the Kingdom of God, and themselves thrust
out, and thrust down to Hell.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Concerning the aggravations, or vexing con|siderations,
which Gospel sinners will have in their
going away;</HI> as the sin of those is more hainous,
who sin against the light of the Gospel, than of
those who sin only against the light of nature: so
their punishment will be more severe; all shall be
beaten, but these persons with many stripes; as

there will be degrees in glory; though all will be
filled with glory, yet some will have a larger ca|pacity:

will be capable of in their punishment of
loss; when</P>
<P>1. <HI>They shall have a clear discovery of the glory
and happiness which they have missed;</HI> now they
hear of heaven and the happiness which the Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
shall have in the vision and fruition of God;
but there is a vail of unbelief upon their minds,
that they do not apprehend such a happiness as is
spoken of; they have mean thoughts of God, and
of Heaven: they think there is no heaven like
the earth; and no happiness like the fruition of
the creatures; no glory like the glory of the
world, no treasures like earthly treasures; and
no delights like those which they finde in the
objects of their sense: but when their portio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
in this life shall be spent; and the good things
which they enjoyed shall be taken away from
them; when their honours shall vanish like
smoke, or a thin vapour; their riches shall flie
away like an Eagle, or sail like a ship out of
their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ight; when their sensual delights and plea|sures
shall fail them, and die like sweet flowers
in their hands; when the bright cloud of earthly
things, which shadowed the glory of heavenly
things from their view, shall be blown away, and
the vail shall be torn in pieces which was before
them, and hindred them from looking into the
Holy of Holies; and the scales shall fall off from
their eyes: In a word, when the heavens shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="121" REF="65">
pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth, with
the works thereof shall be burnt up; and they
shall be awakened out of their long sleep in their
graves, and shall be summoned before the tri|bunal
seat of Christ, and stand there stripped
and quite naked of all their enjoyments in the
world, which they had set their hearts upon;
and they shall be examined and condemned for
their sins; <HI>then, then</HI> their eyes will be opened,
and they will clearly see their mistake of happi|ness;
then they will perceive and be fully per|swaded
of the fulness of joy and unspeakable
pleasures at the right hand of God, the least taste
of which would ravish their hearts ten thousand
times more than all the full draughts, which they
have taken in the sweetest of all their sinful de|lights:
I say, they shall see this happiness, and
that which will vex them to the heart will be,
that they shall only see it, not injoy the least share
in it. O what high apprehensions will they then
have of the glory of Heaven; they will see the
Crown which will be put upon the head of the
righteous, which will have more worth then in
their esteem, than all the Crowns and Scepters of
the greatest Kings upon the earth; then they
will be clearly convinced that the choicest trea|sures
were in Heaven, and the sweetest delights
were to come, and the thoughts of missing this
Crown and glory, such treasures and sweetness,
will tear their very hearts: they must go away from
heaven and happiness.</P>
<P>2. <HI>In going away they shall remember the capacity
which they had once of obtaining this happiness;</HI> if
they had been bruits indeed, and had capacity
<PB N="122" REF="66">
for a sensitive life only; and grace and glory had
been removed so far beyond their reach, that it
had been impossible for them to attain it; it
would not much trouble them to lose it, what|ever
other miseries they should endure; but
they were capable of the beginnings of Heaven
in the life of grace, and the compleating of their
happiness in glory; they will remember that
they had souls endued with reason, and hereby
advanced to a higher capacity than beasts; that
they had minds capable of divine contemplation,
and hearts capable of divine affection; that they
had wils which might have chosen God for their
portion, and Heaven for their heritance; that
they had desires, and loves, and hopes, and
joyes, which if they had wrought-god-ward, and
Christ-ward, as they did toward the creature, if
they had wrought upward, and heaven-ward, as
they did downward and towards the earth, and
earthly things, they might have been happy for
ever; they will see that others, who had the
same natures, as they had, and were guilty at
first of as great sins, as they had committed, yet
repented and turned, believed and reformed,
were changed and saved; and with unexpressible
vexation they will think that thus it might have
been with them, if they had not been fools, if
they had seriously endevoured to fill up the capa|city,
which God hath given them.</P>
<P>3. <HI>In g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing away they will remember the proffers
which they had of this happiness;</HI> that they lived in
places where the light did shine, and the Gospel
did sound, and Christ was preached and tende|red
with all the benefits of his purchase; they
will remember how often they were called to re|pent,
<PB N="123" REF="66">
how earnestly they were entreated to be
reconciled; they will remember the discoveries,
which were made to them of future glory, and
the invitations which they had to come unto
Christ that they might have pardon and life, and
partake of the inheritance of the Saints in light;
all which was little regarded by them; they will
remember how long, and how loud Christ knock|ed
at the door of their hearts for entertainment;
that he knocked by such a Sermon, such a mo|tion
of the Spirit, by such a judgment, such an
affliction, such a deliverance; and yet that they
barred the door, deafned the ear, and if they
did not fully resolve to keep him out, yet they
put him off with such redious delayes, untill on a
sudden death knocked at their door and broke it
open, and drag'd them away to Hell before they
had given entertainment unto Jesus Christ, and
had provided an eternal habitation for their
souls: they will then remember the opportuni|ties
and seasons of grace, which once they en|joyed;
that once they had a Day, a Day of
grace, and that with some of them it was a
long Summers day; and that they had calls at the
first hour, and the third hour, and the ninth
hour, and at the eleventh hour, and that all the
day long God stretched forth his hand unto them;
but they did not know the day of their visitation;
they were more foolish than the Crane and the
Stork, and the Swallow, they did not under|stand
their appointed time; they did not mind
the things which belonged to their peace, untill
they were hid from their eyes; they slept in the
harvest, they loitered away, and sinned away
their time, and wasted their day, in which they
<PB N="124" REF="67">
should have made provision for their souls: O how
will they be then ready to tear themselves in
pieces, that they should neglect so great salva|tion,
in the day when salvation was attainable?
yea, that they should refuse the proffers of grace,
and pardon and peace, and life and happiness,
which in that day were so frequently and ear|nestly
made unto them: then they will wish
that they had opened their ear and heart, that
they had regarded and accepted such gracious
proffers, whatever they had neglected or parted
withall: then they will wish they had imbraced
and improved the opportunities which once they
had for prayer, and hearing, and attendance up|on
Gods Ordinances; that they had been in the
Church, when they were in the Ale-house; that
they had associated themselves with Gods peo|ple,
when they frequented the company of the
leud, and ungodly; that they had been upon
their knees with grief confessing sin; when they
took so much delight in the commission of it; that
they had taken time from their sports to make
their peace with God; that they had worshipped
God in their Closets, and worshipped God in their
Families, and laid up for themselves treasures in
Heaven; and horrible will their vexation be that
they did not so.</P>
<P>4. <HI>In going away, they will remember for what it
was that they refused this happiness;</HI> that it was only
for the satisfaction of some foolish and unprofitable
lust: If two Kingdomes of equal worth and glo|ry
were proposed to a Mans choice, it would not
trouble him that he had refused the one, to obtain
the other; but if a Man were to chuse whether he
would be a King or a slave; if he should refuse
<PB N="125" REF="67">
the former, and chuse the later, when he came to
feel the misery of his bondage, this would trouble
him, more than the bondage, that he might have
avoided it, that he hath chose this thraldome, and
parted with a Kingdome for it: they will then
perceive that they have chosen to be slavesunto
sin, and Sathan, rather than to be Heires unto the
Kingdome of Glory; I know that though now
they are slaves, and serve divers lusts, and though
their bondage is a thousand fold worse, than if
they were Vassals to the cruellest Tirant upon
Earth; yet they are not sensible, neither are they
weary of their bondage; because their wills are
in thraldome, and their affections are captivated;
and though heirdome to the glory of Heaven, be
the choicest priviledge upon Earth, and most desi|rable;
yet they do not desire it, but prefer their
slavery before it; because they are blinde, unbe|lieving,
besorted sinners, and judge of things ac|cording
to sense; yet on the day of Christs ap|pearance,
all things will appear with a new face,
and they will look upon things with a new eye;
they will then perceive that they were slaves all
their dayes; and that there was no such drudgery
as that which they were employed in; and that
there was no such glory and happiness, as that
which they refused, and foolishly cast away; then
it will sting them indeed to remember that they
have chosen rather to do the work of the Devil,
and yield obedience to the basest lusts, for which
they must now be repayed with the wages of death
and eternal misery, than to do the work of the
Lord, who would have rewarded them with eter|nal
life, and a Crown of glory and immortality.
Then they will say, <HI>What profit have we got by
<PB N="126" REF="68">
those things, whereof we are now ashamed! What
fruit doth all our labour and toile in the World now
yield unto us? What are we the better for our riches
and great estate on Earth, for our honour, and high
esteem amongst men, for our luscious pleasures and de|lights,
(now vanished and gone) which we bought at
so dear a rate, as the loss of our precious and immortal
souls, and the forfeiture of an Inheritance in the king|dome
of Heaven?</HI> Then they will cry out, <HI>O be|witching
World! O deluding Devil! O deceitfull
hearts and lusts! O what fools and mad-men have we
been, that we should trample Iewels under our feet like
Swine, and in stead of them, put dross and dung into
our Cabinet! that we should so greedily drink the
sweet poison of sin to the bane and ruine of our souls;
and refuse to taste of the Cup of salvation, which all our
dayes was held forth unto us!</HI> Then they will cry out
of their voluptuousness, their covetousness, their
pride and haughtiness, and the like lusts, which
have kept Christ out of their hearts, and kept
them out of the Kingdome of Heaven.</P>
<P>5. <HI>In going away, some of them shall remember
how neerly they missed of this happiness;</HI> that they
were almost perswaded to be Christians, in deed as
well as in name, and to accept of Christ upon
his own termes; that they were not far from the
Kingdome of Heaven; that they were come even
within fight of the Heavenly <HI>Canaan,</HI> and yet died
in the Wilderness; that they were come even to
the Gate of the new <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> but finding it too
strait for them, and the luggish of their sins toge|ther,
there they stuck and could not enter in; that
they climbed up a great way of the Hill to <HI>Zion,</HI>
but did not reach the top, and tumbling down,
their fall was the greater; they will remember the
<PB N="127" REF="68">
means of grace which they enjoyed; the Ordi|nances
which they sate under; and the treaties
which the Lord did make with them by his word
and spirit, about their life and salvation; and the
carriage of their hearts towards the Lord in those
treaties; some of them will remember what con|victions
the Lord wrought in them of sin, and
what tremblings of conscience, for fear of Hell
and wrath to come; and if they had followed
that preparative work, they might have quickly
been acquainted with Christ, and escaped the mi|sery
which they feared; but they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tifled convi|ctions,
and shook off their troubles, they shut their
eies against the light, and stilled the noise of their
consciences, and calmed their spirits with the de|lights
and pleasures of the World; and so grew
more hardned in sin than before, and gave such re|pulses
to the spirit, that the spirit quite departed
from them: Others will remember that they were
perswaded to ascend some steps higher, under the
Ministry of the Word: when they were reproved
for such and such gross sins, which they lived in the
practise of, that they could have no ease in their
consciences, until they had broken off that wick|ed
course; that they left off their drunkenness and
their swearing, their uncleanness, and unrighteous
dealing; and were in a great measure reformed
in their lives; but there were some lusts in their
hearts which they hugged secretly, and delighted
in, and could not be perswaded to leave, which
were their undoing: pride, revenge, uncharitable|ness,
covetousness, or the like remained in their
reigning power, which were inconsistent with the
power of godliness: others will remember what
profession they made, and that they went with
<PB N="128" REF="69">
some kinde of gladness in the company of Gods
people, unto his House and Ordinances, and heard
the Word, and received some impressions thereof;
yea obtained some kinde of graces under its influ|ence;
that they had a kinde of righteousness,
repentance, faith, desires, love, joy, hope, that they
had some tastes of the heavenly gift, and the
powers of the World to come, and thought them|selves
as fair for Heaven as the best, and who
ever missed, that they should not miss of glory:
but O the confusion and vexation, which will be
upon the spirits of these Persons when the Lord
Jesus shall disown them, and shut them out of his
Kingdom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">; O what tearings of heart will they
have, when they perceive that they were mistaken,
and finde themselves disappointed of the happi|ness
which they had such hopes of, and confident
expectations to obtain: when they finde that their
silver was but dross, and their graces were coun|terfeit,
and not of the right stamp, that they had
not the Image and superscription of Christ upon
them; when they remember that they had a righ|teousness,
but it was like the morning Cloud, which
the wind of affliction or temptation had driven
away; that they had some repentance, but it was
leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l, not Evangelical; that the teares they had
sometimes shed for sin, were like the early dew,
which the bright Sun of prosperity did quickly dry
up; that they had a faith, but it was a temporary
faith, which wanted deep rooting in the heart
and what ever flourishing fruit it quickly sent forth&punc;
yet the hot Sun of persecution did wither it, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
came to nothing when they were put upon the
Trial; that they had desires after Christ, and the
favour of God and spiritual things; but they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">

but faint velleities, they were like the untimely
birth of a Woman, which never came to any per|fection;
that they had love to God in show, or it
may be at some time a passionate glow of heart
under an Ordinance, which was not enkindled by
a spark falling down from Heaven upon them,
blown up by the spirit of God; but a false or more
inferiour Fire, which arose from a sympathy with
Ministers or other Christians in the more inferiour
workings and expressions of their love, which in the
sincere arose from the right principle; that they had
some kinde of hope, but it was like a spiders web,
broken quickly to pieces, or swept down by the
beesome of destruction with them into Hell; that
they had some joyes; but they were flashy and un|grounded;
some tastes arising from misapprehen|sions
of Gospel-priviledges, and misapplication of
Gospel-promises, all which did quickly vanish and
come to nothing: They will finde, if not before,
be sure at that day that they were mistaken, and
have lost all their pains and labour, for want of a
thorow work of grace; for want of soundness at
the root; for want of hearty sorrow, deep humi|liation;
good-grounded, and deep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rooted faith:
supream love; well-bottom'd hope; universall
reformation and mortification of the deeds of
the body; that none of their actions were accept|ed
by the heart-searching God for want of a right
principle and end; now when these Persons are
sentenced to Hell, and are going away from Christ
and the glory which once they had hopes of, and
were so near unto, and had they gone but a step
or two further, they might have attained, O
with what unconceivable grief and curtings of
heart will it be? they will remember then that
<PB N="130" REF="70">
they did seek to enter in at the strait Gate, and
they will wish with all their hearts that they had
striven, that they had taken more pains, that they
might not have missed and fallen short of salvation:
possibly then with unutterable anguish they may
say, <HI>There is a glorious Inheritance in Heaven, which we
are now, departing from, we often prayed for it when
we were upon the Earth; and if we had been sincere and
fervent, if we had resolved to take the place by storme
and would not have been denyed, we might have got it;
we have read of it in the Word, and heard of it in
Sermons, and it hath been proffered to us freely; and
if we had renounced the World, and forsaken sin, and
chosen it for our portion, we might have had it; we
parted with some sins, if we had left all, it should
have been ours; once we had some hopes of it, when
we had some taste of it, and had done some things to
obtain it; and if we had gone a little further, we might
have indeed obtained it; if we had taken pains with
our hearts before God to get them raised to things above;
if we had denyed our selves, and mortified our mem|bers
upon the Earth; if we had cast away all our trans|gressions,
and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st away our own righteousness, and
rowled our selves wholly upon Iesus Christ, and acted
faith upon him and the promises of this Kingdome, and
walked in the narrow way which we seemed to walk in,
we might now have been made passessours hereof, and
shined amongst yonder glorious Saints, some of whom
were our companions, and hoped for our company, and
wonder to see us separated from them; But alas
we were sloathfull and careless; we were unwatchfull
and idle; our pains was more to appear religious, than
be religious; we had some lusts which lay nearer our
heart than Iesus Christ; we did some things with
seeming vigour, but carnal motives were the chief in|centives
<PB N="131" REF="70">
to our duties; and how ever lifeless, faithless,
and empty of true grace they were, yet we trusted in
them, and made them our Saviour, and never were
brought clear off from our own bottome, unto a closure
with Iesus Christ, and we have fool'd away our sal|vation,
and made our selves unworthy of eternal life.</HI>
Deservedly, deservedly <HI>do we lose this crown; for our
folly! O that we had been sincere, and thorough Chri|stians!</HI></P>
<P>6. <HI>In going away it will sting the wicked to think
that now this happiness of Heaven is irrecoverable,</HI>
once they might have obtained it, and that upon
easie tearmes; yea after some refusals of it they
had fresh proffers and invitations; the door of
mercy, and gate of salvation and glory stood open
a long time; but now the door is lookt upon them,
and will never be opened more; they must go a|way
without any hopes of ever entering into the
new <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> or obtaining the least degree of
the happiness of the Saints; they must bid adieu
unto joy and comfort for ever. These considera|tions
will sting Gospel-sinners in their going
away.</P>

They shall drink of the Wine of the wrath of God, which
shall be poured out, without mixture, into the Cup of
his indignation, and be tormented with Fire and Brim|stone,
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for
ever and ever.</HI> The punishment then will be Gods
wrath, which the damned shall drink of, so as to
feel the immediate impressions thereof upon their
souls; and Fire and brimstone kindled by the
breath of God, the impression whereof they shall
feel upon their bodies; but what tongue can ex|press
the punishment of the wicked in Hell? if
some expressions in Scripture concerning it be me|taphorical,
surely they fall short of what the real
punishment will be; the drops and sprinklings of
Gods wrath here are but small in comparison with
the Ocean, which the wicked shall be cast into:
the top of the Cup hath nothing of the bitterness
which they will finde in the dregges: never was
there such a Fire on Earth, as the Fire of Hell;
never was there such a pain endured by those
which have undergone the more exquisite tor|ments;

holy, just, powerful, and sin-revenging God; the
wicked will then fall into his hands immediate|ly,
and <HI>O how fearful a thing will it be to fall into
the hand of the living God?</HI> Heb. 10. 31. Wicked
men now have no fear of God before their eyes;
though their sins and affronts to God be great;
and his anger and displeasure against them be
great; yet because his goodness and patience
towards them is also great; because he keeps si|lence,
and doth not speedily execute his ven|geance
upon them; therefore they are secure, and
insensible of his displeasure; and have slighter
thoughts, and lesser fear of him, than of weake
dying worms like themselves: but when their
eyes shall be opened, at the last day, and a disco|very
of God shall be made unto them in his in|finire
Majesty, and greatness, and power, and
holiness, and fiery indignation against them: O
how fearful then will it be to fall into his hands?
It will be very sweet to fall into the arms of his
Love; but very dreadful to fall into the hands of
his displeasure; when God doth execute his ven|geance
himself, he will do it very terribly, especi|ally
if we consider,</P>
<P>1. That he will glorifie his infinite <HI>wisdom</HI> in
the punishment of the damned, which will con|trive
such tortures for them, that if all the men
in the world should joyn their wits together, and
take to their help all the Devils in hell, they
could not invent the like; dreadful ingredients
will his wisdom finde out to put into the cup,
which he will put into the hand of the wicked to
drink.</P>
<P>2. That he will glorifie his infinite <HI>power,</HI> he
will make bare his arm, and smite with an in|finite
<PB N="134" REF="72">
force; the blow of a childe will take little
impression, but if a <HI>Goliah</HI> smite with a <HI>Goliah's</HI>
sword, he will smite to the ground; the weigh|tier
the hand, the heavier the stroke; there is
more difference between the power of God and
the strongest creatures, than between the stron|gest
creature and the weakest childe; It would
be dreadful to be delivered up to the power of
some strong fierce and cruel creatures: what
will it be to be delivered up to the power of the
omnipotent and most furious God. God will
glorifie the power of his anger in the destruction
of the wicked, <HI>Rom. 9. 31. What, if God willing to
show his wrath, and to make his power known, &amp;c.</HI>
God will show what his power can do in the pu|nishing
of the wicked; his last work of power in
punishing, will be as glorious as his first work of
power in creating; and he will glorifie the power
of his anger in hell, as he will glorifie his good|ness
and love in heaven; in heaven he will open
the treasures of his love, and in hell he will open
the treasures of his wrath. God will inflict the
punishment.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Concerning the subject of the punishment</HI> which
the wicked shall go into, and that will be both
soul and body.</P>
<P>1. The <HI>souls</HI> of the wicked will be punished;
not only with the loss of the glorious and com|fortable
presence of God, and the happiness of
heaven; but also I conceive that they will be fil|le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
with anguish through the impressions of Gods
wrath upon them; they will be filled up to the
brim with the fierce wrath of God; the Arrows of
<PB N="135" REF="72">
the Almighty will be shot up to the head in them,
and pierce them thorow and thorow; we read
<HI>Rom. 2. 8, 9. Of indignation and wrath, tribulation,
and anguish, which at the day of wrath shall be upon
every soul that doth evil.</HI> The impressions of Gods
indignation and wrath on the soul will effect tri|bulation
and anguish: such wounds they will have
in their spirits, as will be unsupportable, such
tribulation as will be horrible, such anguish as is
inconceivable, when the hand of the Lord is upon
them, when they see the frowns of his brow;
when he strikes them with the blow of his anger.
Christ tasted the bitterness of Gods wrath in his
soul, for the sins of others, which caused his
bloody sweat in the garden, and such roarings
upon the cross: O how bitter will the wrath of
God be to the wicked, when their souls taste of
it for their own sins; It will be Gods wrathful
presence, which the souls of the damned will feel
the impressions of, which will make Hell to be
Hell, as it will be the glorious and comfortable
presence of God, which the souls of the righteous
will feel the impressions of, which will make Hea|ven
to be Heaven.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>bodies</HI> of the wicked shall be punished,
they have been sharers in sin, and they must share
in torment; they must lie in the <HI>Lake of fire and
brimstone, Rev.</HI> 21. 8. the torment of the bodies of
the wicked will be dreadful; besides the impres|sion
which the anguish of soul will make upon
them, they will have their own proper torment,
through the sense of the fire which will be kindled
about them, and burn more horribly than <HI>Londons</HI>
fire did, when it had got into the heart of the City;
their torment will be greater than if scalding
<PB N="136" REF="73">
lead were poured into their bowels; than if they
were torn in pieces with wild horses; than if their
breasts were ript up, and their heart were pluckt
out with burning pincers; it will be worse than
if they were cast into a caldron of boiling pitch
or lead; or put into <HI>Phalaris</HI> Bull, or <HI>Nebuchad|nezzars</HI>
fiery Furnace: the torture of the damned's
bodies will be far beyond the sharpest pain now
incident to humane nature by racking diseases,
or have been inflicted upon any of the children of
men by the most cruel tyrant; for the bodies of
the wicked when raised again, will be strength|ned
unto a greater capacity for punishment, when
they will be made incorruptible and immortal,
and punishment will be the end of their resur|rection;
but more of this punishment under the
properties.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Concerning the properties of the punishment</HI>
which the wicked shall go into.</P>
<P>1. It will be <HI>universal,</HI> it will not onely be in
soul and body, but also in every part of both: in
every faculty of the soul, in every member of
the body: O the black thoughts! the dismal ap|prehensions!
the grisly fancies! the heavy griefs!
the sinking fears! the dreadful terrors! the hel|lish
gripes! the utter despair! the horrible an|guish,
and confusion! which the soul will have,
when the wrath of God shall be poured in upon
it like water; the wicked will not only be in hell,
but they will have a hell in themselves; in their
consciences, they will have a never dying worm,
which will gnaw and tear them; they will have
a storm in their spirits raised by the winde of Gods
<PB N="137" REF="73">
wrath, which will blow most fiercely upon them;
every faculty of the soul will be afflicted according
to its capacity: and every member of the bodies
of the wicked will be tormented. O how will
their eyes glare! their tongues roar! their hands
and feet fry! their flesh rost! no part will be
free from the devouring flames of this horrible
burning Fire, There are many diseases which the
body is exposed unto in this world, but very sel|dome
do they meet together in the same subject;
if the head ake, the members may be free; if the
foot be pained, the hand may be at ease, and
ready to contribute some relief unto the pained
part; and if the body be sick, the soul may give
some consolatory arguments to alleviate the irk|someness
of the disease; but in hell the punish|ment
of the wicked will be universal, it will be in
every member of the body, and every faculty of
the soul.</P>
<P>2. The punishment of hell will be <HI>extream;</HI>
the souls of the wicked will be filled with anguish,
as full as they can hold; their capacity will be
larger, and they will be filled up to the height of
their capacity; and their bodies also will have
the most exquisite pain, as it is possible for them
to endure; their sense of pain will be quicker,
and their strength to endure pain greater; and
their pain will be in the uttermost extremity:
some pains of the body here are not very acnte;
and some troubles of mind may well enough be
born; but any disease in extremity is very irk|some;
the pain of the head, or the tooth in ex|tremity,
the gout, stone, chollick in extremity;
especially the troubles of the mind in extremity,
will make a man weary of his life; but to have
<PB N="138" REF="74">
every part afflicted in extremity, and the utter|most
extremity, and that beyond our now ca|pacity
or conception, this will be very dread|full.</P>
<P>3. The punishment of the wicked will be <HI>con|tinual,</HI>
without any intermission or alleviation; the
wicked will have <HI>no rest day nor night, Rev.</HI> 14. 11.
there will be nothing but <HI>weeping and wailing and
gnashing of teeth, Matth.</HI> 22. 13. The most painful
diseases here have their fits, which do not con|tinue
long; the diseased finde after their fits
some ease and asswagement; they have intermis|sions
sometimes; some <HI>lucida intervalla,</HI> lightsome
intervals; but the wicked in hell will have no
ease or asswagement; no lightsome intervals of
their grief and pains; there will be no mixture of
comfortable ingredients in the cup of God's
wrath, which the damned must drink of; there
will be but one fit in their disease, and this fit
will alwaies be at the height; they will not have
the least drop of water to cool so much as the tip
of the tongue, which shall be tormented in
flames; their grief will not have any allay, they
will not have one comfortable thought, no eye
to pitty them, none to bring any relief unto
them: O how bitter will their sins be to them; here
they are but bitter sweets, then they will be no|thing
but bitterness, and gall, and worm-wood,
unto them; Their punishment will be conti|nuall.</P>
<P>4. The punishment of the wicked will be <HI>re|mediless;</HI>
there will be no escaping or flying from
the wrath of God; now sinners may flee from
the wrath which is to come; but when it is once
come, and hath got hold on them; it will hold
<PB N="139" REF="74">
them down, so that they shall never get loose
from it: now they may agree with their adversary
upon the way; they may make their peace with
God in this world; there is no sin for which they
may not obtain a pardon, but the unpardonable
sin against the Holy Ghost, which carries men a|way
from God; but hereafter in hell there will
be no more sacrifice for sin; the Saviour of man|kind
will be their judge, and pass an irreversi|ble
sentence of condemnation upon them; it is
possible now for the wicked to be delivered <HI>from</HI>
this punishment, but it will be impossible then to
be delivered <HI>out of it;</HI> their punishment will be
remediless.</P>
<P>5. The punishment of the wicked will be <HI>e|ternal,</HI>
hell fire will be <HI>unquenchable, Mark</HI> 9. 43.
<HI>everlasting, Matth. 25. 41. the smoak of the tor|ment
will ascend up for ever and ever. Rev.</HI> 14. 11.
This eternity of punishment will be a fearful ag|gravation
of it; If you saw a malefactour torn to
pieces with wilde horses, or thrown into a fiery
furnace, and there burned to ashes; you would
say that either of these were dreadful punish|ments,
though the pain possibly might not endure
a quarter of an hour, for death concludes all bo|dily
pains here: what then will it be to endure
the torments of hell for ever? a small pain, if it
should last long, would be very irksome; much more
some racking pains by the stone, strangury, gour,
cholick, and the like, if they should continue for
a year, or a moneth together, how miserable
would they make the life to be? yea, if a man
should hold but one of his fingers in the fire but
for a day, it would afflict him more, than all
outward comforts could delight him; the tor|ments
<PB N="140" REF="75">
of Hell will not be in one part only, but
in every part; not in a weaker degree, but in
the greatest extremity; not for a day, or a
month, or a year, but for ever; the wicked will
be alwaies dying, never dead; the pangs of death
will be ever upon them; and yet they shall ne|ver
give up the ghost; if they could die they
would think themselves happy; they wil alwaies
be roaring, and never breathe out their last; al|waies
sinking, and never come to the bottome;
alwaies burning in those flames, and never con|sumed;
the eternity of Hel, wil be the Hel of
Hel. When our Saviour endured equivalent pu|nishment
to this of Hel, for his people, it had not
this circumstance of eternity in it; there not
being that need, because of the excellency of
his person; so that though the pains of Hel gat
hold on him, yet they could not keep him in
hold, but he brake thorow them, and triumphed
over them, and could say in the conclusion, <HI>It
is finished:</HI> but the damned wil not be able to
break thorow their punishment; they wil be
compassed about with them, and hedged in, and
shut down, and never be able to lift up the
head; never shall they say of this punishment, <HI>It
is finished,</HI> for their pains wil alwaies be as it
were beginning; when they have spent the time
of as many years in Hel as there are Stars in the
Firmament, Sands on the Sea shore, and Moats
in the Sun, their torment wil be as it were be|ginning,
and no nearer a conclusion; than the
first day they were cast into that place. Who
can express this eternity? when we lanch
forth our thoughts in the consideration thereof,
we lose them quickly; it being such a deep which
<PB N="141" REF="75">
cannot be fathomed, such a vast Ocean which can|not
be measured; yet a little to extend your
thoughts in the consideration of the Eternity of
the wickeds punishment. I shall by one or two
suppositions illustrate something of the vastness
hereof.</P>
<P>Suppose that this globe of Earth on which we
tread were hollow, and that it were filled with
great folio Books, as full as it could hold; and
moreover there were Books heaped up upon it to
fill the whole circumference of the aire round a|bout
it; yea that the whole space of place to the
uttermost verge of the Empyrean Heavens were
filled with Books; and all this vast number of
Books were filled with figures in the highest degree
of multiplication; O what a number of Books
would there be in the whole space of place? what
a number of figures in these Books? and what a
vast number would there be deciphered by these
figures? A bit of paper half as broad as an half
penny will hold the figure of the number of as
many years as have been since the creation of the
World; what then would a whole leaf of a great
folio hold? what would a whole folio hold: what
then would a room full of folios hold? but what
would the whole World full of folios hold? now
if at the end of time, when the wicked go to Hell,
God should fill the whole space of the World
with folios full of figures of numbers; and tell
the wicked that every thousand year one of these
numbers should be substracted, and promise them
when all the numbers were substracted our of all
these Books, they should have a release out of
their torments; they would have a small spark of
hope, that after the substraction of so many mil|lions,
<PB N="142" REF="76">
millions, millions of innumerable numbers,
in the revolution of so many millions, millions,
millions of innumerable years, yet at last there
would be an end; there would be time then set
and a wearing towards an end; yet if we could
cast our thoughts so far in a supposition, that all
this number of years, wherein all this number of
figures were substracted by one in a thousand years
were past and gone; yea wherin they were all sub|stracted,
as many thousand times as the number of
the figures in all those Books would amount unto;
yet even then the punishment of the damned
would be as far from ending, as at the very first
beginning of them.</P>
<P>Yea suppose further, that there were as many
Worlds as the number in the Books before suppo|sed
would arise unto; and these Worlds should
continue as many years as by this account there
would be Worlds; and all these Worlds were
filled with Angels and Men; and all these Angels
and Men should be employed in nothing else from
the beginning of these Worlds unto the end of
them, but in conceiving numbers of years unto
the uttermost conception which they could have of
numbers; what a-to-us-inconceivable number
of years would there be conceived by so many
Angels and Men, in so many years, in so many
Worlds? yet if all that vast number of years were
joyned to the end of the time wherein all the
numbers in the figures of so many before-menti|oned
Books, were substracted by one in a thousand
years; and these multiplied as many thousand
times as numbers were conceived; such a vast
number of years would reach a great way, but
they would not be so much as a haires breadth in
<PB N="143" REF="76">
the measure of eternity; and if we should sup|pose
the space of all these years too, to be spent by
the damned in torments, even then their tor|ments
would be as far from a conclusion, as they
were upon their first entrance into Hell. <HI>O Eter|nity!
Eternity! Eternity! how vast is Eternity!
how infinite and immeasurable!</HI> how horrible will
the thoughts of Eternity be unto the damned!
to be punished so extreamly, and that without any
intermission, or hopes of a conclusion! to fall
into such a horrible Pit, and fiery Lake, and there

when the whole crew of wicked and ungodly per|sons,
together with the whole Flock of Devils
are departed from the presence of Christ, and
the glorious Saints; and Heaven is now upon
their backs, and Hell before their face; and they
are now come to the very mouth of the bottom|less
Pit, unto the Doors and great Gates of Hell;
and now they are opened before them, and unto
them, and for them; and they see the black smoke
ascending up from thence, and smell a horrible
stink from the sulphurions Fire, which they must
be thrown into; and when they behold the hor|rible
<PB N="144" REF="77">
slakes of Fire flashing forth from the Fur|nace
of Hell, ten thousand times more dreadfully
than those which were seen to arise from <HI>London</HI>
on the Munday night; and now begin to feel the
heat; and see others tumbling in before them,
and they following of them; and when they be|gin
first to put their hands and their feet into the
Fire; and now they are in and covered with
flames, and begin to boile and fry, and when they
perceive the Gates of Hell to be shut upon them,
and great Stones rowled before them which can
never be removed, and great Bars put upon them
which can never be broken, and they are out of all
hopes of ever breaking Prison, and getting forth;
O how will they shreek, and roar, and cry out in
the anguish of their souls, and torture of their bo|dies,
<HI>Woe, woe le unto its miserable sinners! and is
this the Hell which Ministers warned us to flie from?
and yet trould we needs run our selves into such flames?
Is this the wages of our sin? hath our drunknness, and
swearing, and whoring, and lying, and unrighteous
dealing, such a dreadfull consequent as this? Is this
the company we must take up our eternal abode withall?
and this the place of our eternal habitation? must we
then dwell in this devouring Fire? and inhabit these
everlasting burnings? O miserable! miserable! for|lorn
wretches we! would God we had never been born!
O that we had been Dogs or Swine! O that we had
been Serpents or Toads! O that we had been the mean|est
Worms, or Stones, or anything without Souls who
are now annihilated! O that we had been nothing, or
might be turned to nothing! O that we could recall our
time! how would we improve it. O that it were with
us, as once it was, when our being and abode was upon
the Earth, when the day of grace did shine upon us,
<PB N="145" REF="77">
and the meanes of grace were afforded to us! how
would we pray, and hear, and watch, and strive, and
live! how would we forsake sin, accept of Christ, and
deliver up our selves unto universal obedience! But
alas time is fled! the day is spent! the door is shut!
we are bound up in Chains; which cannot be loosened!
we are now in torments, which cannot be remedied;
and are extream, and will never be ended! O the
pains of my eyes! would I had none! O the pains of
my tongue! would it were out, and I were dumb! O
the torture of my hands and feet! would they were
off, and my whole body were consumed! O I am sick!
I am sick! and here is no Physician! I am sad! I am
sore troubled! and here is none to pitty me! my head

1. <HI>Concerning the righteous going away,</HI> The
wicked shall go away, and the righteous shall go
away too; the wicked shall go away from Christ
and Saints, and the happiness of Heaven; and the
righteous shall go away from Devils and wicked
Persons, and the misery of Hell, which with some
considerations will be unspeakably comfortable
unto them.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The righteous shall go away from Devils;</HI>
Christ doth here redeem them and deliver them
from that tyrannical power which the Devil had
over them before conversion, yet they are not
wholly freed in this life from all his assaults and
baits and snares; some of them are much buffeted
and oppressed by him most part, if not all their
dayes; but at the last day they shall all go away
from Sathan; the Devil and all his Angels will be
lockt up in the bottomless Pit, and the righteous
will never be molested with any of them any
more, however the righteous sometimes are foil|ed
by Sathan here, and receive some wounds in
their spiritual combat; yet then they will be vi|ctorious,
and triumph over principalities and
powers, and leave them bound in Chains behind
them; they shall go away from Devils.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The righteous shall go away from all the wicked
Persons;</HI> some of the wicked separated them from
their company when they lived on Earth; now
God will separate them from the company of all
the wicked; they were hated by the wicked and
troubled by them, and some of them suffered much
under their reproaches and persecutions; then the
wicked will cease from troubling them any more:
<PB N="147" REF="78">
their hearts were grieved with their oaths and fil|thy
lewdness and ungodly conversation in the
World; but now they shall go away from the
wicked, no Devil, nor wicked Persons shall be
admitted into their society, or have any room in
the place whether they are going.</P>
<P>3. <HI>The righteous shall go away, from that place and
state of misery which the wicked shall go into;</HI> they
shall be delivered from the damnation, and pun|ishment
of Hell, and all fears of it for ever:
and herein their joyes will be unconceivable,
in that,</P>
<P>1. <HI>They shall have deeper apprehensions of the pun|ishment
of Hell, than ever did here enter into their
hearts to imagine;</HI> they were told by the Word
and Ministers what a dreadful punishment was
preparing for the damned; and they did believe
it, and fear it, and flee from it; but the one
half was not told them; the Fire which they con|ceived,
was but as it were a painted Fire in com|parison
with that which they will see the wicked
cast into; the pains they fancied were but flea|bitings,
in comparison with those which they will
see the wicked undergo: they guessed something
at the wrath of God, by the little scortchings
thereof in their first conviction of, and contrition
for sin; by the sweetness of Gods smiles of love
afterwards, they judged that his displeasure and
fury would be unsupportable; but their thoughts
were mean, and short of that fiery vengeance and
dreadful wrath which then will break forth into a
flame to consume the ungodly: as the wicked wil
have high apprehensions of the glory and happi|ness
of the righteous beyond whatever entred into
their hearts to conceive here in this World, and
<PB N="148" REF="79">
it will be their unutterable grief to be deprived
thereof, and shut out for ever from the Kingdome
of Heaven, which the righteous with joy and tri|umph
shall go into: so the righteous shall have
deep apprehensions of the sufferings and misery
of the wicked, beyond whatever they did imagine
here; and it will be no small part of their joy
that they are delivered from this misery, and saved
from the torments of Hell, into which they shall
see the wicked go into, with such dread and hor|rour.
<HI>Lazarus</HI> will then see <HI>Dives</HI> tormented;
the other Apostles will see <HI>Iudas</HI> thrust into Hell,
and all the righteous will be Spectators of the
vengeance which the Lord Jesus will execute up|on
the ungodly World; and O how will they
then adore Gods electing love? how will they va|lue
the blood of Christ, which was shed for the
redemption of them? how will they bless God for
pardoning mercy? how will they hugg the feet of
their Saviour, who hath delivered them from this
so dreadful wrath, and fearful torments which
they will see inflicted then upon the damned?
especially,</P>
<P>2. <HI>When they consider in their going away, that
they were by nature Children of wrath, even as o|thers;
Eph.</HI> 2. 3. That they had as soul natures as
the vilest; that they had as leprous, poisonous,
odious hearts, until they were renewed and san|ctified,
as those which they shall see condemned
and tormented; that they were sometimes foolish
and disobedient, serving divers lusts, and pleasures,
hateful and hating one another, until the kindness
and free love of God was manifested in the rege|neration
and renovation of them by the holy
Ghost. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 3, 4, 5. That they were dead in sin
<PB N="149" REF="79">
with others, and walked according to the course
of the World, according to the Prince of the po|wer
of the Aire, who wrought in them, as in other
Children of disobedience, so that they were as for|ward
as others to fulfill the desires of the flesh
and of the minde, and ran with others to the same
excess of riot; until God who is rich in mercy,
for his great love wherewith he loved them, had
quickned them and saved them by his grace, and
hereby put a difference between them and the
wicked, who went on to the end of the sinful
course in which sometimes they were running with
them in company. <HI>Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</HI> yea
some of them will remember, how they out-strip|ped
others in sin, and were guilty of more gross
breaches of the Law than many millions of the
wicked, whom they will see condemned; and
that <HI>they</HI> should escape, and be awakened to repent,
and enabled to believe and reform; and that <HI>they</HI>
should obtain pardon and salvation thorow Christ,
when others were passed by, and let alone to pe|rish
under smaller sins; this will fill them with a|stonishing
admiration, and wondering joy: when
they see some of their neer Relations going to Hel,
their Fathers, their Mothers, their Children, their
Husbands, their Wives, their Brethren, their
Sisters, their intimate Friends, and Companions;
however they are grieved now to see them take
such courses, and walk in the way to Hell, and
they labour to pull them out of that way, and
would fain perswade them to walk with them in
Heavens way; and are troubled to forethink of
the torment which they must endure, if they go on;
yet hereafter relative tyes, and those affections
which now they have to relations out of Christ, wil
<PB N="150" REF="80">
cease; and they wil not have the least trouble
to see them sentenced to hel, and thrust into
the fiery furnace; but rejoyce in the glory of
God which wil be manifested upon them in their
destruction; and, O the joy that they wil be fil|led
withal to think that they were not passed by
with the rest of their relations; that they are not
under the same deserved-condemnation with
them; that God should chuse but one or two in
many families, and they should be in the num|ber
of the chosen ones; that when his chosen were
comparatively so few, and the reprobates so ma|ny,
that they should be elected; when there was
no motive in them to encline God to the choice
of them, that he should chuse them freely; if
he had not chosen them, if they were now to
change places with some of their wicked relations
going to Hel; this would be dreadful; but that
they are going from Hel, when their relations are
going into it, this wil fil them with joy unspeak|able.
Especially,</P>
<P>3. <HI>When they consider in their going away, that
they were sometime so neer to Hell;</HI> that whilst they
were in a state of nature, and under the guilt of
sin, that some of them were neer to death; that
they were brought to the sides of the pit, to the
doors of the grave, to the very brink of Hell, be|fore
they had repented, and accepted of Jesus
Christ; some of them will remember how neer
they were to death when they were young; how
neer they were to death by some casualties: how
neer by some diseases; some of them will re|member
the great Plague in <HI>London,</HI> which swept
away so many thousands&punc; how ill they were pro|vided
for death at the beginning thereof; how
<PB N="151" REF="80">
neerly they escaped the disease; and some which
had the disease, how neerly they escaped death
by it; and if they had died then, that they should
certainly have gone to Hell: O how will they ad|mire
the Providence of God in keeping them a|live,
notwithstanding the many dangers they
were in of death, all the daies of their unrege|neracy;
and when they moreover consider how
they tried Gods patience, and trampled upon it,
by their hainous provocations; how they abused
his goodness, and turned his grace into wanton|ness;
how they did hasten in the waies of sin to|wards
hell, and were come even to the end of
the line; that some of them were Drunkards, and
Sabbath-breakers, and profane persons, and swea|rers,
and unclean persons, and persecutors of
the people of God, and were arrived even to
the heighth of wickedness, and wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed but a step
or two of falling into Hell; and yet that the Lord
should meet with them, with a flaming sword in
the way of sin, they were driving on so fast and
furiously in, and stop them, and turn them; and
change them, and bring them home to himself;
yea, when they had deafned their ears against many
calls, and stifled many convictions, and often
quenched the motions of his spirit, and were so
unwilling to leave their sins, and to come out of
the way of destruction, &amp; were so desperately bent
upon their ruine; that yet he should knock, and
call again and again, and follow them still by
his Spirit; that he should lay hold on them as
the Angels did on <HI>Lot,</HI> and bring them out of
<HI>Sodom,</HI> even by force; and over-power the con|tranitency
of their stubborn wills, and break
open the door of their hearts, and overturn the
<PB N="152" REF="81">
strong holds of sin and sathan, and set up the
throne of his Son within them; that he should
snatch them like fire-brands out of the fire; and
pluck them out of the snare of the devil, that
had almost drag'd them into Hell; O how will
they be astonished to remember Gods infinite
pitty and love, and the power of his rich grace
that did work salvation for them? especially when
they perceive how dreadful the misery is which
they were hastning unto? I have heard of a man
who in the night galloped over a high bridge
which was broken down all but a narrow plank,
which Gods providence directed his horses feet
upon; which if they had slipt never so little on
the one side or the other, horse and man had fal|len
into the deep stream, and been drowned;
which the man did not know till the next mor|ning;
but then, viewing the place, and conside|ring
the danger he had so narrowly escaped, was
struck with such astonishment at it, that he fell
down dead in the place. When some of Gods
people shall go away from Hell at the last day,
and look behind them into the bottomless-pit,
and take a view of the streams of fire and brim|stone,
which are running in the burning lake;
and remember how they have galloped over those
streams, when they were in the carreer of their
sins; and by how narro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> a planke they passed
over them; that if they had slipped but a little
aside, they had fallen into the lake, from whence
they could never have got out; when they shall
remember how neer they were to Hell, and how
narrowly they have escaped such horrible tor|ments;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urely they will be struck with such admi|ration
and joy which now they could not bear,
<PB N="153" REF="81">
but would over-whelm their spirits, and bring
immediate death upon them; but then their
nature will be strengthned to bear this joy,
which might be enough to sweeten an eternity, if
they had no other happiness than the consideration
of the misery from which they have been so won|derfully
delivered. Thus concerning the going

<P>1. <HI>Concerning the eternal life which the righteous

frequently for the life of grace; but chiefly, and
so here, for the life of glory: by eternal life we
are to understand the glory and happiness which
the righteous shall have in Heaven, of which hap|piness
in Heaven I shall speak,

<ITEM>1. Subjectively.</ITEM>

<ITEM>3. Formally.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>1. <HI>Subjectively.</HI> The subject of the happiness in
Heaven, will be both the <HI>bodies</HI> and the <HI>souls</HI> of the
righteous.</P>
<P>1. The <HI>bodies</HI> of the righteous will be subjects of
the happiness of Heaven.</P>
<P>1. They shall be most <HI>glorious</HI> bodies, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.
43. <HI>They are sown in dishonour,</HI> when they die;
<HI>they shall be raised in glory</HI> at the resurrection;
some glory and Majesty is put upon the bodies of
men now, in comparison with the bodies of in|feriour
<PB N="154" REF="82">
creatures; but the bodies of the righte|ous
shall then be made a thousand-fold more
glorious; there is not so great a difference be|tween
celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; be|tween
the body of the glorious Sun, and the
body of the meanest fly or worm, as then there
will be between the bodies of the righteous on
earth, and in heaven: they will be celestial bo|dies;
they will <HI>shine like Stars, Dan.</HI> 12. 3. Yea,
<HI>like the Sun in the Kingdom of their father, Matth.</HI>
13. 43. their bodies will be transformed, where|by
their dirty hue will be changed, more than
if all the stones in the street were turned into
Diamonds, <HI>Phil. 3. 21. Their vile bodies will be fa|shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed
like unto the glorious body of Christ:</HI> Now their
bodies are vile, being so frail, especially as they
are the instruments of sin; they are earthy, as
they bear the image of the <HI>earthy Adam;</HI> then
they shall be glorious, because they shall bear
the Image of the <HI>Heavenly Adam:</HI> the bo|dies
of some doe now shine with Gold and
Pearls, and costly Apparrel which are about them,
and yet under all, their bodies remain vile bodies;
but hereafter the bodies of the righteous shall
shine with a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rvellous brightness and glory
through the qualities which shall be in them, be|yond
what the richest attire can give.</P>
<P>2. And by consequence the bodies of the righ|teous
shall be most <HI>beautiful</HI> bodies: they shall
have a perfect beauty, beyond whatever eye did
behold, in the fairest women that ever lived upon
the face of the earth.</P>
<P>Their bodies will have the most exact syme|trie
of parts; those which were mis-shapen here,
shall then be healed of that imperfection in their
<PB N="155" REF="82">
bodies; the crooked back shall then be made
straight; the members which now are wanting,
shall be supplied, and the parts which now are
dissolved shall be put into the right place; and all
joined so exactly together; especially the linea|ments
of the face shall have such a figure and
composition, as shall render their feature most
lovely, and graceful, beyond what the greatest
observers, and admirers of beauty, can conceive
in their fancy.</P>
<P>Moreover, the bodies of the righteous shall
have a most sweet mixture of colours; there will
be no black skin, no swarthy complexion, no pale
face, no wan look; their colour will be most love|ly,
without change or fading; there will be no
wrinkles of old age, but they will be alwaies
young, fresh, and blooming; if the composition
of these elements, which are so dreggish, doth
give forth in some such loveliness of colour, what
wil the more refined composition of the bodies
of the righteous do, and when the Lord will
fashion their bodies after the pattern of his Sons
body: and therefore I conceive further that the
bodies of the righteous shall have a most comely
stature, not dwarfish not gigantick; but accor|ding
to the measure of the stature of Christ:
And lastly, to compleat their beauty, I doubt not
but they wil have most graceful gestures and
sparkling motions in their countenances; they
wil have no grief to deaden their beauty, no
anger or envy, or the like, to change and
transform their visage; but love and joy
wil continually look out at their eyes, which will
marvellously add to the lustre and sweetness of
their beauty; they shall have most beautiful bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="83">
3. The bodies of the righteous shall be most
<HI>strong,</HI> that they may be sutable to their great
soul, and fit for such works as in heaven they
must be employed in; were they weak as now
they are, they would never endure such works
and motions, they would tire and faint, their
spirits would quickly be spent; but in Heaven
there will be no lassitude and weariness; no fain|ting,
or failure of spirits; all their motions,
though never so great and continual, will be
sweet and delightful; and therefore their bodies
must be strong that they may be sutable hereun|to:
Moreover the glory of Heaven, which they
shall have in their eye would sinke a weak body,
and the ravishing joyes and love, the transports
of their souls in the visions which they shall have,
would crack a weak vessel to pieces; they must
be strong to bear the glory of the place; and
when besides they must endure unto all eternity;
and all this without reparation, by meat, or drink,
or sleep; I conceive that no bodies visible to us
are made so strong, as the bodies of the righteous
will be made at the last day.</P>
<P>4. Hence it follows, that their bodies will be
most <HI>healthfull</HI> bodies, they will be free from
all pain, and disease, which may in the least
weaken them; the temperature of their bodies
will be so exact, that there will be no fighting of
contrary qualities within them, no flowing of
ill humours: In Heaven there will be no plague
nor ague, not feaver, nor gout, not stone, nor
strangury, nor any distemper, no need of
food to preserve health, nor physick to recover
it.</P>
<P>5. The bodies of the righteous will be <HI>spiritual</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="83">
bodies, I <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 44. not absolutely spiritual;
for then they would cease to be bodies; but com|paratively,
to what they are now, they will be
spiritual, that is, I conceive they will be quick
and nimble in their motions, like spirits; now
they are dull, and slow, and heavy, and a clog to
the spirit; I conceive that hereafter they shall be
like Angels for quick and nimble motion; they
may be so qualified, as in a moment to move
many thousand miles; why may not they move
so quick then, as well as the Sun and other Stars
in the Firmament do so now, which are bodies of
many thousand times greater magnitude.</P>
<P>6. The bodies of the righteous will be <HI>incor|ruptible
and immortal, 1 Cor. 15. 43. It is sown in
corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</HI> And v. 52,
53. <HI>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump, the dead shall be raised incorruptible;
for this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
mortall must put on immortality.</HI> And <HI>v. 54. Then
shall come to pass the saying which is written, Death
is swallowed up in victory,</HI> Now death is unavoi|dable,
and unto some is very terrible; death hath
all the children of men in the chase, and shoce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
his arrows at the righteous, as well as the wicked;
and though they be delivered from the <HI>sting</HI> of
death which is sin, yet they are not delivered
from the <HI>stroke</HI> of death; but however death
play the tyrant here on the earth, and spare none;
yet he will have no footing in Heaven; the
bodies of the righteous when raised up again
will be impassible and immortal; immortality
will be swallowed up of life, and the life of
the body, as well as of the soul will be ever|lasting.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="84">
2. The souls of the righteous will be the subjects,
and the chief subjects of the glory and happiness
of Heaven; if their bodies shall be glorious, their
souls shall be much more glorious; as being their
more excellent part, and capable of more glory
than their bodies will be; we read, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 18.
Of the glory which shall be revealed in us, that
is, in the soul; and the Apostle tells us, that, <HI>The
sufferings of this present time, are not worthy to be com|pared
with this glory;</HI> the greatest sufferings and
calamities in this World have not that evil and mi|sery
in the least shaddow of comparison, with the
happiness of the glory which shall be put into the
souls of the Saints; indeed the Apostle doth com|pare
them, and see how he makes this future glory
to out-ballance. 2 <HI>Cor. 4. 17. These light offlictions,
which are but for a moment, do work for us a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</HI> The af|flictions
are light, but the glory will be weighty,
the afflictions are but for a moment, but the glory
will be eternal; the weight of glory will be ex|ceeding,
more exceeding, far more exceeding,
here the Apostle layes one high expression upon the
back of another, and another upon that, like so
many great Mountains upon the back one of ano|ther,
and when he hath got upon the top of the
highest of them, yet he is too low to look into the
glory of Heaven, and his expressions and appre|hensions
fall short of the glory which shall be re|vealed
in the soul, when it shall be received into
the new <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> for it is yet to be revealed: and
therefore as the Apostle <HI>Iohn</HI> saith, I <HI>Ioh.</HI> 3, 2.
It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but when
Christ shall appear, we shall be made like him;
not only the body shall be made like his glorious
<PB N="159" REF="84">
body, but also the soul shall be made like his glo|rious
soul, for we shall see him, as he is&punc; as the
eye doth receive the image of the object, which
it looks upon, so the soul in its vision of Christ
shall receive the Image of Christ, and have a per|fect
similitude and likeness unto him; the soul will
be made most beautiful, the perfect lineaments of
Christ will be drawn upon it: if grace makes the
soul to shine here, how much more will glory,
which is grace in the perfection of it, make the
soul to shine in Heaven? and therefore grace is
called glory, it is glory begun: 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 18.
<HI>We all with open face beholding, as in a Glass, the
Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image,
from glory to glory, as by the spirit of the Lord.</HI> The
Vail, which was under the Law, is now taken a|way,
and with open face we behold the glory of
the Lord, that is, I conceive the Lord Jesus Christ
who is the glory of the Father, the brightness of
the Fathers glory; which glory was more dark to
our view under the Law, represented by the cloud,
which filled the Temple; but now there is more
clear revelation of Christ without the Vail, and
clouds of types and figures, whom we now see in
the Glass of the Word and Ordinances, and here|by
are changed into his Image, and receive fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
him impressions of grace, which is glory begun,
through the operation of his spirit in his Ordinan|ces
upon us; yet stil we see him in a Glass, and
therefore there is a darkness, through this inter|position;
and the eye of our faith which looks
thorow this Glass upon Christ is weak, and there|fore

this coming of Christ was foretold by <HI>Enoch, Iude

and remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not
prevent them which are asleep: For the Lord himself
shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the
voice of the Arch-angel, and with the Trump of God:

Book of God may be believed, this concerning
Christ's second coming and appearance may be
believed, of which we have such frequent and
evident testimonies in the Word; as surely as he
came the first time in the flesh, according to the
predictions hereof in the Old Testament: so surely
will he come the second time in glory, according
to the predictions in the New Testament. God
can as soon cease to be God, as this Word concer|ning
Christs second coming fail; when the Sun goes

arise at such a time in the morning, &amp; accordingly
it comes to pass: So now Christ the Sun of righte|ousness
is gone into Heaven, whilst the night of
this world doth last, though we cannot know the
certain time, yet we may believe that he will
certainly return, and come down from Heaven
in the morning of the resurrection; it is more
possible that the Sun when it is set, should abide
for ever in the other parts of the world, and never
<PB N="173" REF="91">
arise any more in our Horison, than that Christ
should abide for ever in Heaven, and not return
to judge the World, when the thing is evidently
revealed&punc; and frequently promised in the Scripture.</P>
<P>2. <HI>That the Scriptures are true is evident, because
they are the Word of God;</HI> who is a God of truth,
and cannot lie; who can as soon cease to be God,
as cease to be true; untruth in God would argue
weakness and imperfection in God, which cannot
be, since to be infinitely perfect is his essential
property. That God doth know whether Christ
shall appear to Judgment, I suppose none will de|ny,
who acknowledge the Deity, and by conse|quence
his omniscience and prescience, especially
when the futurity of things doth depend upon his
predetermination; and that his revelations of fu|ture
things are true, I suppose none wil deny, who
acknowledge his beeing and perfection, whence
follows an impossibility of Gods speaking untruths,
and falshood; besides that he need not do it:
But then the question wil be, concerning the Divine
Authority of the Scriptures, whether they are in|deed
the Word of God, which (if proved) wil evi|dence
the certainty of Christ's coming to Judg|ment,
which is there revealed and foretold.</P>

1. From the superscription and Image of God
upon them, I mean in that, 1 They bear the
name of the Word of God. 2 In that they bear
such evident marks and characters of Divinity.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The Scriptures bear the name of the Word of
God. 2 Tim. 3. 16. All Scripture is given by di|vine
inspiration.</HI> We cannot rationally imagine
that the all-seeing and jealous God should permit
such an impious forgery and deceit to receive cre|dit
for so many generations, amongst the most zea|lous
worshipers of him in the World; and by such
wonderful providences preserve and maintain the
Scriptures against the rage and fury of an ungodly
World, who have opposed the truths therein con|tained,
and endeavoured the suppressing of the
Light, which therein hath shined, if so be that
they had been a forgery and deceit indeed, and the
fancies and inventions of Men, fathered upon him
as his Word, and will, and proceeding from the in|spirations
of his spirit; but that he would have
made known their falshood unto some, at least, who
had the greatest love and respect to his name and
honour, and have been the most diligent enqui|rers
after truth, and unwilling to be imposed up|on
with deceits, especially in such things as are of
the highest concernment; which the Lord having
given no testimony against, but all along owned;
and when none in the World, either worshippers
of him, or others of highest pretensions to reason
have any evident and swaying reason to believe
that the Scriptures are a deceit; (whatever some
black mouths mutter in corners) it is not irrational
for us to believe, that the Scriptures are indeed the
<PB N="175" REF="92">
Word of God, which they bear the Title of.</P>
<P>2. Moreover and especially, the Scriptures ap|pear
to be from divine inspiration, insomuch as
they <HI>bear such evident marks and characters of divi|nity
beyond all other Books.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>The first character of Divinity in the Scriptures,
is the clear discoveries and high praises, which they
give of God, and the chief design of the whole Book,
which is Gods glory.</HI> No Heathen Philosopher or
Writer could think, or speak so highly of God, as
the Scriptures do speak. However God hath put
characters of himself in the Book of the Crea|tures
to be read of all, making known by his
Works his eternal Beeing, his infinite Power,
Wisdome and Goodness; yet most of the wisest
Men, who have lived in the Heathen World, and
have been the greatest Students of the Book of
the Creatures, and have had no view of the Book
of the Scriptures, have been so gross in their con|ceptions
of God, that as the Apostle saith, <HI>Rom.
1. 22, 23. When they professed themselves to be wise,
they became fools; and changed the Glory of the incor|ruptible
God, into an Image made like to corruptible
Man, and to Birds, and four-footed Beasts, and
creeping things;</HI> They have figured to themselves
and worshipped many Gods, unto the dishonour
of the true God: And if some of them have ar|rived
by the light of nature, unto the notion of one
God; yet their conceptions of him have been low,
mean, and unworthy of him: and in no Book in
the World is God set forth so fully and highly in
his glorious attributes, and superlative excellen|cies,
as he hath set forth himself in the Book of
the Scriptures. We may finde in heathen Wri|ters
high Elogium's and Panegyricks of some men
<PB N="176" REF="93">
and Women, famous in their time, for their valour,
and some moral vertues, whom they have deified
in after ages, and given room amongst their feign|ed
Gods and Goddesses, dedicating Temples, and
giving worship unto them: but in no Heathen
writings shall we finde the praises of the true
God, and rules given for the service and wor|ship
of him alone, as we shall finde in the Scrip|tures.
Large Volumes some Heathens have left
behinde them, the design of which hath been their
own glory, and (as much as in them lay) the eter|nizing
their Fame, which is an evidence that them|selves
were Authors of them; because we cannot
rationally think that any motive should induce o|thers
to make, and put forth Books in their names,
that they might obtain glory for them unto whom
it did not belong: so this little volume of the Scri|ptures,
designing the glory of God, and the pro|moting
of his Interest in the hearts of Men, and
the Pen-men employed in the writing thereof, not
in the least pretending, that what they wrote, was
the invention of their own brain, doth evidence
God himself to be the Author of this Book.
Wherefore the Scriptures being so clear in their
discoveries of the one true God, and setting him
forth more gloriously than any other Book, and as|cribing
all praise and honour to him, and appoint|ing
all religious worship to be given to him only,
and designing his glory throughout the whole,
doth evince that the Scriptures are indeed the
Word of God.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The second Character of Divinity in the Scri|pture
is, the sublime mysteries therein revealed;</HI> name|ly
concerning the Trinity of Persons in one nature
and essence of God; the hypostatical union of the
<PB N="177" REF="93">
two natures of God and Man in one person of
Christ; the mystical union of Christ and his mem|bers,
and the like; which mysteries are so sub|lime,
so high, that no mortal Man of the highest
reason, and most elevated understanding could
possibly invent, in as much as no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> they are re|vealed,
they exceed the capacity of the most en|lightned
to understand: especially if we further
consider by whom these mysteries were revealed;
not by the great Schollars, and subtle Philosophers
of the World; not by them who were brought up
in Schools, and had conversed with Books and
learned Men; not by Men of high parts, who
had polished their reason, and heightned their un|derstandings
by all possible humane helps&punc; but the
most of the Pen-men of the Scripture, especially
those by whom the greatest mysteries are revealed,
were Fisher-men, Publicans, and the like; Men
of mean education, illiterate Men; Men of no
reading, and of but mean natural abilities; as ap|peares
not only by the history, but also by the stile
of their writings; which hath not that politeness
as is to be found in many humane Authors; which
doth not run in such a golden stream of eloquence,
neither is dressed with such neatnesses of wit, nor
garnished with such flowers of Rhetorick; which
is not methodized by the rules of Logick, nor en|terlarded
with any peepings of humane wisdome;
which doth not savour of high parts, and great na|tural
ingenuity, or give the least suspicion of cun|ning
and subtilty, which these Men had above o|thers;
But some of the highest mysteries of divi|nity
are set forth by these Pen men in a passsing-mean
and home-spun dress, yea they are left even
naked and bare of such apparel, as the ingenuous
<PB N="178" REF="94">
Men of the World have cloathed their matter
withall, which hath given the light of the most
glorious truths and mysteries more evident disco|very;
not but that some parts of the Scriptures have
such a strain of divine eloquence, as doth exceed
humane writings; but the plainness of the stile,
especially of the Apostle <HI>Iohn</HI> in his Gospel, and
<HI>Matthew,</HI> &amp;c. Doth evince that what they deli|vered
was not their own invention, but that they
were acted by another spirit in the writing of
them, even by the spirit of God, who did reveal
all the mysteries, which they speak of in whole,
unto them.</P>
<P>3. <HI>A third Character of Divinity in the Scriptures
is the wisdome which there doth appear, especially the
wonderful contrivement of God's wisdome in Mans re|demption
and salvation by Iesus Christ, which is there
made known;</HI> No Book in the World doth shine
with such beames of wisdome, as the Word doth;
it doth teach Men wisdome, spiritual and divine
wisdome, in comparison with which all the wis|dome
of the World is but foolishness; It doth ir|radiate
the minde with the most glorious light, and
proposeth to the understanding the most noble ob|jects;
it discovers the greatest truths of the great|est
concernment; it sheweth the way to avoid the
most dreadful effects which sin will produce, and
to obtain the highest happiness which humane na|ture
is capable of; which is one part of its divine
stamp. Moreover the Scriptures do set forth the
infinite wisdome of God, in the wonderful con|trivement
of the salvation of fallen Man by his
only Son the Lord Jesus Christ, the only Saviour
of Man-kind, which wisdome being so transcen|dent,
doth evidence both the Contrivement there|of
<PB N="179" REF="94">
in Mans salvation, and the discovery thereof in
the Scriptures to be from himself: so that as by
the light of the Word we may know what this
wisdome was, even so by this wisdome we may
know the Word to be the Word of God.</P>
<P>To clear this Argument, I shall show, 1. That
the way of Mans salvation by Iesus Christ, which
the Scriptures reveal, must needs be the con|trivement
of Gods wisdome. 2. That the reve|lation
of this contrivement must needs be from
God, which I suppose will be an evident demon|stration
of the Divine Authority of the Scri|ptures.</P>
<P>1. <HI>That the way of Mans Salvation by Iesus Christ
was the contrivement of Gods wisdome,</HI> will appear,
because it was impossible for any Man of the most
searching brain, and most notable invention to
have imagined it. Man being guilty of sin against
the Law of God, inscribed upon the hearts of all
Men, which natural Conscience will accuse of, if
sinners listen thereunto; and Gods Justice being
engaged to inflict a punishment proportionable un|to
the crime without a satisfaction, which right
reason will say is but reasonable; and this justice of
God being infinite; must in reason require an in|finite
satisfaction; Now what created understand|ing
could of it self have contrived or conceived a
way how this should be done? Every thing that
hath a being, is either God or a Creature; all
the Creatures are finite in their Beeings and acti|ons,
and therefore could not make an infinite sa|tisfaction;
It is God only who is infinite, and he
being the party offended could not make satisfa|ction
to his own justice, especially since his justice
requires punishment for satisfaction, which God
<PB N="180" REF="95">
as God, being impassible, is uncapable of; not
to say any thing that the same nature which did
commit sin should in justice suffer the punishment;
would not reason now conclude, that it were im|possible
for this satisfaction to be made? Surely
it was none but the wisdome of God that could
contrive the way of satisfaction to his justice, by
the incarnation of his Son, by the union of the
divine nature in the second Person of the Trinity,
unto the humane nature in the Person of Christ,
that so by vertue of the hypostatical union, the hu|mane
nature might not only be strengthned to un|dergo
the wrath of God, which was due for the
sins of Men, in the sufferings which he endured be|fore,
and upon the Cross; but also that through
the communication of attributes, the sufferings of
Christ might be of infinite value, because the
sufferings of such a Person as was God, as well as
Man, that so they might be a full satisfaction unto
Gods justice for sin; and through Gods Covenant
with him, and gracious acceptation of this satisfa|ction
from the surety, instead of the offenders
themselves, the sins of Men might be pardoned,
and their souls saved. <HI>O the depth of the Wisdome
of God!</HI> here is the wisdome of God in a <HI>mystery!</HI>
surely they are blinded and hoodwinked by the De|vil,
who do not acknowledge that this was the
contrivement of Gods wisdome.</P>
<P>2. <HI>That the Revelation of this contrivement of wis|dome,
was from God:</HI> will appear in that none could
know the minde of the Lord herein, unless he
himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> had discovered it; <HI>What Man,</HI> saith the
Apostle&punc; <HI>kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">eth the things of Man, but the spirit
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> which is in him, even so the things of God
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">noweth no Man but the spirit of God. 1 Cor. 2. 11.</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="95">
And <HI>the spirit of God searcheth all things, even the
deep things of God;</HI> and unless the spirit had re|vealed
these things, we must have remained in our
ignorance of them, since it could not have enter|ed
into our hearts to have conceived them: seeing
then none could have discovered the deep con|trivements
of Gods wisdome, unless God by his
spirit had revealed them, and seeing these con|trivements
are revealed in no other Book, but the
Book of the Scriptures, it is evident that the Scri|ptures
must needs be the Word of God: which
also will further appear, if we consider the man|ner
of the Revelation of the mystery of Mans re|demption
and salvation by Jesus Christ, that it
was revealed by pieces, and more obscurely at
first; and that divers Men were made use of in
the discovery thereof in divers ages, who spake
hereof mostly in dark sayings; and where they
spake most clearly, yet themselves had not a clear
understanding of what they were moved to speak
by the Holy Ghost; but searched what, and what
manner of time the Holy Ghost which was in them
did signify, when it testified of the sufferings of
Christ, and the design of them; whence it is
evident that they were not, neither could be the
Contrivers of what they revealed, but that the
Revelation was from the spirit of God, which did
inspire the Prophets, and was the same in all the
Pen-men of the holy Scriptures, whom Men of
insight in the Scriptures may plainly perceive to
be guided and acted by the same spirit in their Re|velation
of the contrivement and way of Mans
salvation by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>4. <HI>A Fourth Character of Divinity in the Scriptures
is the Purity and Holiness of them;</HI> the Scriptures,
<PB N="182" REF="96">
are like Silver or Gold purified, and seven times
tried in the Fire, wherein no dross doth remain.
<HI>Psal.</HI> 12. 7. the Scriptures are pure and holy, from
the beginning of them to the end: In no Histo|ries
shall we finde such examples of holiness, as
the Scriptures do record; in no Writings of mo|ral
Philosophers, shall we finde such precepts of
holiness, as in the Scriptures are enjoyned: In|deed,
the light of nature hath been improved by
some Heathens so far, that they have given ex|cellent
rules for the restraining of vice, and ob|taining
of moral vertues, and the ordering their
conversations in such a vertuous way, that those
persons, who have observed these rules, have
been illustrious in their generations, and have
shined with some kinde of brightness in the dark
places where they have lived; but in no book
that ever issued from the brain of man, shall we
finde such exact rules for holy living, as in the
Book of the Scriptures; In this Book we finde the
moral Law summarily comprehended in the Ten
Commandements, which was written by God
himself on the Tables of Stone, when <HI>Moses</HI> was
with him in the Mount; in which there are such
holy precepts&punc; as no Heathen author can show
the like: the Heathens were blinde, as to the du|ties
of the first Table of the Law, which have a
reference unto God, and in observance of which,
mans holiness doth chiefly consist; in the second
Table duties they had some understanding, yet
they were much mistaken in some things, ac|counting
some sins, as ambition, self-murder in
some cases, and the like, to be vertues; and
they had not so deep an insight into sin, they did
not apprehend the inclination of the heart, and
<PB N="183" REF="96">
the previous motions to the consent of the
will to evil, (which the Scriptures do discover)
to be sinful and offensive in the eyes of a pure and
holy God.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the Scriptures we finde the holy
precepts of the Gospel, which the Heathens were
strangers unto; and a way discovered not only
for the obtaining the pardon of sin, but also
for the subduing and mortifying of sin: where
means are made known, not only for the re|straining
of a vicious nature, but also for the
changing of it, for the regenerating of the soul
of man, and forming it after the Image of
the holy God, in knowledge, righteousness,
and true holiness, the making men partakers of
the divine nature, which Heathens never un|derstood
the meaning of: the Scriptures show
the way of obtaining the sanctifying graces of
Gods Spirit, which do further exceed the mo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">all
vertues of the Heathen in lustre, than the
Sun doth exceed the lesser Stars in brightness and
glory.</P>
<P>Marvellous is the purity and holiness of the
word, such as doth not savour of any thing ter|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ene
and humane; yea, it is such as is directly
opposite to the natural biass of the hearts of all
men and women in the world, whilst they are
in a state of nature; such as doth contradict car|nal
affections, and against which the carnal mind
hath a natural enmity; and unto which all such
and none but such have a liking and love, as are
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">egenerated by the Spirit of God; whence it
strongly follows, that the Scriptures could not
proceed from men, but that this holy Book did
proceed from the immediate inspiration of the
<PB N="184" REF="97">
holy Ghost, in those holy men which were the Pen-men
thereof.</P>
<P>2. <HI>It will appear that the Scriptures are the word
of God from the marvellous power and efficacy of them.</HI>
Such a power and spirit hath and doth accom|pany
the preaching of the Gospel, which in the
Scriptures is contained, as doth evidence them
to be from God alone: we read 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 12. of
them which preached the Gospel with the holy
Ghost sent down from Heaven. This hath been
this is unto this day.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The wonderful power of the Gospel in the first
preaching</HI> of it, doth evince that it was from God
when so great a part of the world was in so sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
a time subdued unto the obedience thereof; whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
the Gospel prevailed not only amongst many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
the Jews after Christs ascension, and the effu|sion
of the holy Ghost more largely upon the A|postles,
so that three thousand people were con|verted
to the faith by one Sermon of the Apostl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<HI>Peter, Acts</HI> 2. 41. and five thousand mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e, <HI>Act.</HI> 4&punc;
4. but especially, in that it prevailed among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
the Gentiles and Heathens, and so many Chur|ches
of Christ were planted and brought, not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
carnal weapons but by Spiritual, to the sub|jection
and obedience of the Lord Jesus. This
power will appear to have been from God, if we
consider,</P>
<P>1. How <HI>few</HI> men were employed in the firs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
preaching thereof; there were not many whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
we read of, besides <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Sar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">abas</HI> who prea|ched
unto the <HI>Gentiles</HI> at the first. If there ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
been multitudes of witnesses, it might have gi|ven
<PB N="185" REF="97">
the more credit to the Doctrine, when the
testimony of a few is not easily believed and re|ceived.</P>
<P>2. That these men were but of <HI>little esteem</HI>
in the world; that they were Jews whom the
Gentiles had an antipathy against; and so were
not so ready to believe their report, and enter|tain
their message; that their persons were con|temptible
in their eyes; that they were like cruci|fied
persons to the world, and therefore unlikely to
finde acceptation.</P>
<P>3. That whatever <HI>humane Learning and Wis|dom</HI>
any of them were endowed withall, yet
they did <HI>not make use of it</HI> in their preaching, they
did not come with excellency of speech and wis|dom
in declaring the testimony of God, but used
all plainness, which was not likely in it self to pro|duce
such great effects.</P>
<P>4. That the doctrine which they preached was,
1. <HI>New</HI> to the world, and tended directly to
pull down the old religion, and superstitious wor|ship
of the heathenish gods, which they had been
brought up in, and wedded unto, which could
not be done by any humane power.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Strange,</HI> they preached such things as were
above reason, and therefore the world might have
had much show and pretence of reason, to have
excused themselves from yielding obedience there|unto.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Strict,</HI> severe, and contrary unto na|tural
inclination and interest, they taught the
world to deny themselves, to crucifie the flesh, to
mortifie the deeds of the body, to take up the
cross, to mourn and weep for sin, to endure
hardship, to forsake father, and mother, and wife,
<PB N="186" REF="98">
and children, and houses, and lands, if they stood
in competition with Jesus Christ; to venture im|prisonments,
yea to lay down their life for Christ,
as many of necessity must and did do, that would
be Christians indeed in those daies; and when
the Doctrine of the Gospel was such, surely it
was not likely of it self to receive entertain|ment,
unless the power of God had accompani|ed
it.</P>
<P>5. The power of the Gospel in the first prea|ching
appears, in that it <HI>met with so much op|position;</HI>
the <HI>Devil</HI> stirred up instruments against
it, <HI>the powers of the Earth</HI> were against it, as well
as <HI>the powers of Hell! great men</HI> did oppose it,
<HI>Philosophers</HI> were against it, <HI>Learned men</HI> did op|pose
it; the <HI>Iews</HI> were against it, and raised up
persecution against the Apostles, and <HI>the hearts
of all men</HI> naturally were against it; and when
there was such an opposition against it, surely it
was none but the power of God which could
cause it to prevaile and conquer, and cause so ma|ny
Nations to bow and yield obedience hereunto.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The wonderful power and efficacy of the word,
where it is preached unto this day,</HI> is a strong argu|ment
that it is the Word of God.</P>
<P>1. The power of the Word to <HI>search the heart,
and convince of sin. Heb. 4. 12. The Word of God is
quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged
Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the
soul and spirit, and is a discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart;</HI> there is a <HI>light</HI> in the
Word, which discovereth the dark filthy cor|ners
of the heart, and convinceth of secret sins;
and there is a <HI>sharp edge</HI> in the word to cut
and wound; no word in the world searcheth
<PB N="187" REF="98">
and pierceth, like the word in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>2. And especially the power of the Word doth
appear in the work of <HI>conversion and regeneration,</HI>
which it effecteth; it is called the <HI>incorruptible
seed, by which men are born again. 1 Pet. 1. 23. Of
his own will begat he us by the word of truth. Iam.</HI> 1.
18. there is a great power goeth along with it,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o break rockie hearts, to bow stubborn wils, to
spiritualize carnal affections, to subdue strong
lusts, to work a gracious and thorow change in
the heart of man, which exceedeth the power of
nature, or moral suasion; and in so much as all are
not wrought upon by it which read or hear it, yea
sometimes the more disposed subject receiveth no
impression thereby, and the less disposed subject
is effectually changed; which shows, that the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ower doth proceed from God, and that the
work is effected by his Spirit, and proves the di|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ine
Authority of this Word.</P>
<P>3. The Word is powerful, not only for the first
working of grace, but also for <HI>the encrease</HI> there|of,
for the building up believers, <HI>Act.</HI> 20. 32.
for the perfecting of the Saints, and the edifying
the body of Christ; there is Milk in the Word
for babes, and strong meat for strong men; whol|some
words, which have much spiritual nourishing
vertue in them: the Word is powerful, for the

and rejoycing of distressed and disconsolate souls,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hen they are brought even to the brink of de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">air;

the Scriptures do, wherefore it must needs fol|low,
that these Scriptures are indeed the Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
God.</P>
<P>3. The Scriptures appear to be the Word of God

declared in, speaketh so much simplicity in the re|lators;
when there were so many Copies of the
Records dispersed into so many divers places;
when Enemies could not deny the truth of things
recorded, only imputed them to other causes;
when mention is made of these things in profane
Histories; when we have the Writings of the an|cient
Fathers by us, who lived in all the Centu|ries
between us, and the time of Christ, and with
one consent acknowledge these things, who might
easily have found out the deceit, had there been
any, when they lived some of them so neer to the
days wherein the chief of these things were done;
when we cannot rationally assign an end, which
should move Christians to deceive themselves and
posterity, since they exposed themselves to such
losses, persecutions, reproaches and afflictions by
their profession of Christianity; neither can we
rationally imagine how all the Christians in the
World could meet together from so many Coun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ries,
for the forging of things which were never

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aid together, we may rationally conclude, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he History of the Scripture is as certain, yea more
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ertain than any profane History, which we
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ave the least doubt of; and if the Histories of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rophesies fulfilled, and Miracles wrought be
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ue, it is a strong Argument that the Scriptures
which hereby are confirmed, are indeed the word
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f God. These Arguments for the Divine Autho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ty
of the Scriptures may be sufficient to stop the
<PB N="192" REF="101">
mouths of gain-sayers, but without the testimony
of the spirit in and by them, none will be suffici|ent
to effect a saving faith. Thus it is evident
from the truth, and divine Authority of the Scri|ptures,
which do so clearly reveal and foretel it,
that the Lord Jesus Christ will certainly appear to
Judgment.</P>
<P>The second Argument to prove the certainty
of Christs appearance, may be drawn from the
certainty of the Resurrection.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Arg.</HI> If all the dead shall certainly le raised
at the last day, and the Lord Iesus Christ shall raise them,
then the appearance of the Lord Iesus Christ to do it
is certain; but all the dead shall certainly be raised at
the last day, and the Lord Iesus Christ shall raise them,
therefore the appearance of the Lord Iesus Christ is
certain.</P>
<P>1. That all the dead, which are or shall be
brought into that state, shall be raised at the last
day, is a truth so clear in the Scripture, that no|thing
is more clear. The general Resurrection
of the dead is one great Article of our Christian
Faith; one Principle of the Doctrine of Christ
made mention of by the Apostle: <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 1, 2.
The dead <HI>sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">l and great</HI> shall be raised, and stand
before God: <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 12. We read of the Re|surrection
of the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st, Luke</HI> 14. 14. Of the Re|surrection
of the <HI>Iust and Vnjust, Acts</HI> 24. 15.
I might multiply many Scriptures to prove this
Doctrine of the Resurrection, but I shall further
speak but of two places which purposely treat
thereof, and being so full of Arguments, I shall
make use of no other than there I finde for the
evidencing of this truth.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="101">
1. <HI>The former Scripture is in</HI> Matth. 22. <HI>from</HI>
vers. 23. <HI>to the</HI> 34. The same day came the Sad|duces
to him, which say there is no Resurrection, and
asked him, saying Master, Moses said, If a Man
die having no Children, his Brother shall marry his
Wife, and raise up Seed to his Brother. Now there
were with us seven brethren, and the first when he had
married a Wife, deceased, and having no issue, left
his Wife unto his Brother. Likewise the second also, and
the third unto the seventh; And last of all the Woman
died also. Therefore in the Resurrection, whose Wife
shall she be of the seven, for they all had her. Iesus
answered and said unto them, Yee do erre, not know|ing
the Scriptures, nor the power of God: For in the
Resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in mar|riage,
but are like the Angels of God in Heaven. But
as touching the Resurrection of the dead, have yee not
read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I
am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of Iacob? God is not the God of the dead, but
of the living. And when the multitude heard this,
they were astonished at his Doctrine. <HI>And vers.</HI> 34.
<HI>it is said,</HI> He put the Sadduces to silence.</P>
<P>Here we have a Disputation concerning the Do|ctrine
of the Resurrection, wherein we may take
notice of,</P>
<P>1. The <HI>opponents,</HI> and they were the <HI>Sadduces,</HI>
who denied the Resurrection, they denyed the im|mortality
of the Soul, for they said there was no
Angel nor Spirit: <HI>Acts</HI> 23. 8. And they denyed
the Resurrection of the body.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Respondent,</HI> and that was the <HI>Lord Iesus
Christ,</HI> the wisdome of the Father; he that when
he was but twelve years old, did dispute with the
Doctors in the Temple, and filled all that heard
<PB N="194" REF="102">
him with astonishment at his understanding and
answers, <HI>Luke</HI> 2. 46, 47. And much more now,
when he was so much encreased in wisdome, was
he able to deal with the <HI>Sadduces,</HI> and answer
them about this truth, of which (he coming out
of the bosome of the Father, and being acquaint|ed
with his secrets) he had so perfect knowledge;
he had answered the <HI>Herodians</HI> before most wisely
to their ensnaring question, whether it were law|ful
to pay tribute to <HI>Caesar;</HI> and he was able to
give answer to the <HI>Sadduces</HI> about the Resurre|ction.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>Objection</HI> of the <HI>Sadduces.</HI> Master,
<HI>Moses</HI> said, &amp;c. their Argument against the Re|surrection
is this, If there were a Resurrection, then
there would be a confusion in Relations, insomuch
as seven Men having been in this World married
to one Woman, all of them would claim a pro|priety
in her, and to whom should she belong,
would not this breed a discord? Must not six of
them with grief be deprived of her, who once was
their Wife? And could this agree with the state
of perfection and happiness, in which all the just
should be raised? The <HI>Sadduces</HI> thought now
they had our Saviour upon the hip; they thought
now it is likely, that they should confound him
with this Argument, that they should gravel him
and shame him before the People; they could not
answer it themselves, and they thought that out
Saviour could not answer it neither; and truly the
objection hath subtilty in it.</P>
<P>4. The <HI>answer</HI> of our Saviour lies in vers. 30
<HI>In the Resurrection they neither marry, nor are given
in marriage, but are like the Angels of God in Hea|ven.</HI>
Hereby he gives them to understand that there
<PB N="195" REF="102">
would be no confusion in Relations at the Resur|rection,
that there would be no enjoyment or de|privation
of conjugal Relations there, because such
Relations would then cease; and Men and Wo|men
would then be like Angels, which neither have,
such Relations, neither do stand in need of them;
the end of such Relations will then cease, and the
Relation will cease too.</P>
<P>1. One end of the conjugal Relation here, is,
the propagation of Man-kinde, insomuch as the
number is incompleat, and will be incompleat till
the end of the World, and the number is com|pleating
by Generation; but at the Resurrection
the number of Man-kinde will be compleat; the
number of the Elect will be perfect, and in this
regard they will be like to Angels, whose number
was compleat at the first, and therefore this end
of marriage ceasing, the Relation should cease
also.</P>
<P>2. Another end of marriage is mutual help;
and this end also will cease; at the Resurrection
the wicked they <HI>shall</HI> have no help, the righteous
shall have <HI>no need</HI> of help from such Relations;
God will supply All, they will be perfect in him;
God will be All, and in All: God will be instead
of Father, Mother, Husband, Wife, and all unto
them, like Angels they shall behhold the Face of
their Father, and have no need of conjugal Rela|tions.</P>
<P>5. And with this Answer to the <HI>Sadduces</HI> Obje|ction,
we may take notice of Christs Discovery of
their <HI>errour,</HI> and the grounds thereof, namely
their ignorance of the Scriptures, and the power
of God; whereby, our Saviour doth suggest a strong
Argument, to prove the Doctrine of the Resur|rection,
<PB N="196" REF="103">
drawn from the power of God, and the
Scriptures; the Argument is this, If there be po|wer
in God to raise the Dead, and in the Scriptures
he hath revealed that he will do it, then there will
certainly be a Resurrection of the Dead; But
there is power in God to raise the dead, and in the
Scriptures he hath revealed that he will do it.</P>
<P>1. That there is Power in God to raise the
Dead, is evident, and none which acknowledge his
Deity can rationally deny; he that had power to
make the World out of nothing, hath power to
raise the Dead out of their Graves; he that had
power to give life, hath power to restore it; he
that hath all power, hath this power; he who is
infinite in power, who is omnipotent, unto whom
nothing is difficult, he can raise the dead, and
joyn soul &amp; body together after a long separation.
There is little doubt, but God can raise the dead,
but the great question lyes in his will, whether he
will or no. Therefore,</P>
<P>2. The Scriptures reveal his will herein; he
that in the Scriptures hath promised that he will
raise the dead, being so powerful and faithful, he
will certainly do it; but God hath promised in
the Scriptures, that he will raise the dead. And
though in the old Testament the Doctrine of the
Resurrection be spoken of more obscurely, yet
our Saviour fetcheth a proof of the Doctrine out
of the Book of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ses,</HI> which the <HI>Sadduces</HI> (as is
observed) did not acknowledge. <HI>Vers. 31. 32&punc;
As touching the Resurrection of the De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d have ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
not read what was said to you by God, I am the God
of Abraham, &amp;c. God is not the God of the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d, but
of the living;</HI> our Saviour proves the Doctrine by
strong inserence drawn from this place, which
<PB N="197" REF="103">
needs a little opening to perceive the argument.</P>
<P>It is not unlikely but our Saviour cleared the
thing in more words, (for we have but the heads
in Scripture of many things which were deli|vered
in large discourses) he made it so clear
that is satisfied the people, &amp; silenced the Saduces.</P>
<P>The Argument formed up is this: If God be
the God of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the God of <HI>Isaac,</HI> and
the God of <HI>Iacob,</HI> when they are dead, then <HI>A|braham,
Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> will rise again from the
dead, and so there shall be a resurrection from
the dead; but God calls himself the God of <HI>A|braham,</HI>
and the God of <HI>Isaac;</HI> and the God of
<HI>Iacob,</HI> when they are dead, as they were, when
he spake those words of <HI>Moses</HI> out of the bush;
therefore they shall rise from the dead. The
consequence our Saviour proves, because he is the
God of the living, and not of the dead; if that
<HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob,</HI> be living before
God, in regard of his purpose to raise them from
the dead, because he is their God, when their
bodies lie rotting in the grave, and therefore
they may be called living when dead, <HI>by him
who quicknefh the dead, and causeth-those things
which are not</HI> (but shall be) <HI>as though they were. Rom.</HI>
4. 17. then <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> shall
be raised from the dead, as certainly as if they
were actually living; but they are living be|fore
God, in regard of his purpose and promise
to make them alive; which is evident from the
nature of the covenant which he hath made with
them, which doth include a promise of blessed|ness,
and perfect happiness, which he will give
unto them. If God be the <HI>God of Abraham,</HI> and
the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Isaac,</HI> and the <HI>God of Iacob,</HI> he is their
<PB N="198" REF="104">
God in covenant, and by consequence will make
them perfectly happy, not only in regard of their
souls, by receiving them into glory, when they
die; but also in regard of their bodies too, by
raising them from the dead at the last day, till
which time their happiness is but in part, and
imperfect; and therefore hence may strongly be
inferred, that they shall be raised; and by con|sequence
all in covenant shall be raised, to re|ceive
the perfect happiness promised in the co|venant;
and by parity of reason, that all out of co|venant
shall be raised to receive the compleat
punishment threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ned to sinners for their sins;
and by consequence that there shall be a gene|ral
resurrection. Thus our Saviour confirms this
great doctrine of the resurrection, whereby he
stopped the mouths of the Sadduces; his answer
made the people astonished, and the Sadduces
confounded; they came with their mouths open,
but they went away with their mouths shut&punc; they
came with full cry, but they went away in silence;
he put the Sadduces to silence.</P>
<P>2. The second Scripture to prove the Resur|rection,
is in 1 Cor. chap. 15. thorowout; It see|meth,
that some amongst the <HI>Corinthians</HI> who cal|led
themselves Christians, did deny the Resurre|ction;
now the scope of the chapter is to refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
this dangerous errour, and to prove the truth, which
the Apostle doth by several arguments.</P>
<P>1. The first argument is drawn from the Re|surrection
of Christ; If Christ be risen from the
dead, then believers which are his members,
shall be raised also; he will not suffer his mem|bers
to lie for ever rotting in the grave, because
his mystical body then would never be grown up
<PB N="199" REF="104">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nto perfection: Christ is the first fruits of them
that sleep, <HI>v.</HI> 10. As certainly as he was awake|ned
out of his sleep in the grave on the third day,
to certainly shall all those that do, or shall sleep
in Jesus, be awakened out of their grave at the last
day: But Christ is certainly risen from the dead,
which the Apostle proves,</P>
<P>1. From the Prediction thereof in the Scrip|tures,
as his death was foretold, so also his re|surrection
was foretold in the type of <HI>Ionah's</HI> being
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ast out of the belly of the whale on the third
day.</P>
<P>2. From the testimony of those persons to
whom the Lord Jesus Christ did appear after his
resurrection, namely of <HI>Cephas,</HI> all the Apostles,
above five hundred brethren at once, who saw
him before his ascension; and last of all, in that
he was seen by himself upon the way to <HI>Damas|cus</HI>
after his ascension: all which witnesses did
with one mouth confirm the truth of Christs Re|surrection.</P>
<P>3. From the absurdities which would follow
if Christ were not risen.</P>
<P>1. The Apostles would then be found false wit|nesses,
and the Spirit of God which spake in
them, would be a false spirit, which is impos|sible.</P>
<P>2. Then their preaching would be in vain, and
the whole doctrine of Christianity, which was
built partly upon this foundation, would fall to
the ground.</P>
<P>3. Then their faith would be in vain: because
if Christ were still dead, he would not be a meet
object for their faith, for then he could not be
the Son of God, nor a Mediatour between God
and man.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="105">
4. Then Believers would be yet in their sins;
their sins would remain unpardoned; because sa|tisfaction
to Gods justice would not have been
compleated, had the bonds of death still held ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Saviour.</P>
<P>5. Then they which were fallen asleep in Christ
would be perished in regard of their bodies, li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
the beasts when they die; because if Christ were
not risen, it would be impossible that they should
ever rise any more.</P>
<P>6. Then believers should have hope only i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
this life; because if Christ were not risen an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
ascended into Heaven, to prepare room for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

Adam</HI> sin came into the world, and death by
sin, and death passed upon all his posterity, be|cause
all have sinned, at least in him: By Christ
came righteousness into the world, and by righ|teousness
life, and all his posterity shall be raised
by him unto eternal life at the last day, because all
are partakers of his righteousness.</P>
<P>3. The third Argument is drawn from the reign
of Christ at the right hand of the Father, until
all his enemies be put under his feet; and the last
enemy which shall be destroyed is death; and
death is no waies perfectly destroyed, but by the
resurrection of the dead out of their graves, and
the putting immortality upon the body: then
when this corruptible shal put on incorruption, and
this mortal shall put on immortality, death shall
be swallowed up in victory; therefore since death,
with other enemies, shall be put under Christ's
feet, it is necessity that there should be a resur|rection.</P>
<P>4. The fourth Argument is in <HI>v. 29. Else what
shall they do that are baptized for the dead: if the
dead rise not, why are they baptized for the dead?</HI>
The words are difficult; various are the inter|pretations
which are given; I like <HI>Calvins</HI> best;
if it will hold with the words, Why are they bapti|zed
for the dead, or for dead? that is, why are they
that are dying, and given over for dead? bapti|zed?
if the dead rise not; why will any when
they are going out of the world be baptized in the
name of Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t? if they did not hope for a resur|rection
at the last; that as they are buried with
him by baptism unto death, so they should rise
with him not only unto newness of life here, but
also unto everlasting life and glory hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="106">
5. The fifth argument is drawn from the jeo|pardie
and sufferings of Christians, which they
would not undergoe unless they had hopes of the
resurrection.</P>
<P>6. The denial of this Doctrine opens a door to
licenciousness. People would eat and drink, and
let l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e the reigns to sensual delights, and com|mit
sin with greediness, if they must die, and
there were no hopes of a resurrection to glory and
happiness, and no fears of a resurrection to tor|ment
and misery.</P>
<P>Besides, Scripture testimony and argument,
which is the only firm proof of the resurrection. I
might add for illustration, some Emblems of the
resurrection in nature.</P>
<P>Naturalists tell us of a <HI>Phaenix</HI> which riseth
out of the ashes, into which she had burned her
self before; but it is more certain, that some birds
lie in holes dead all the winter, and get life a|gain
in the Summer; we see Plants, Herbs, Flow|ers,
and the like wither in the Winter, and spring
forth again when the cold weather is gone; we
see the Sun sets at night, and arise again in the
morning; and we our selves, as we have an Em|blem
of death upon us when we are asleep, so
our awaking again, and arising from our beds,
is an Emblem of our resurrection at the last
day. It is certain that the dead shall be raised,
which hath been proved.</P>
<P>2. And secondly, it is as certain that Christ
shall raise them. <HI>I will raise them at the last day.
Ioh.</HI> 6. 40. this is spoken of believers; but it is
spoken also of all, <HI>Ioh. 5. 28, 29. The hour is coming,
in which all that are in their graves&punc; shall hear his voice
and come forth: they that have done good, to the re|surrection
<PB N="203" REF="106">
of life, and they that have done evil, to the
resurrection of damnation.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it strongly follows, If the dead shall cer|tainly
be raised, &amp; the Lord Jesus shall raise them,
that the appearance of Christ to do it, is certain.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Arg.</HI> The third Argument to prove the cer|tainty
of Christ's second appearance may be drawn
from the certainty of the last general Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>If there will certainly be a day of general Iudg|ment,
and the Lord Iesus Christ will be the Iudge;
then the second appearance of Christ is certain: But
there will be certainly a day of general judgment, and
the Lord Iesus Christ will be the Iudge; therefore
Christs appearance is certain.</HI></P>
<P>1. The certainty of the last judgment is evi|dent
from Scripture, <HI>Heb. 6. 2. 2 Pet. 3. 9. Rom. 2.
5, 6, 7.</HI> and elsewhere frequently, and I shall
further prove it by Scripture arguments.</P>
<P>It doth appear there will be a day of Judgment,</P>
<P>1. From Gods <HI>app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">intment. Act. 17. 31. He
hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world
in righteousness.</HI> God appointed the creation of
the world, which accordingly he effected: he
appointed the reconciliation of the world to him|self,
which he brought to pass; and having ar|pointed
the judgment of the world, it shall as
certainly be brought to pass in its day. Nothing
can frustrate God's appointments, God being so
infinite in wisdom, doth not appoint any thing
about which there shall be any reason to after his
determination; and God being so infinite in
power, nothing can hinder the effecting of what
he hath determined shall be done.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="107">
2. From Gods <HI>Supreme and universal Soveraign|ty;</HI>
he is the blessed and the great Potentate,
which rules over all the Kingdoms of the earth;
<HI>He is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, 1 Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
6. 15.</HI> All the children of men are not only his
creatures, but also his subjects. As it is the work
of earthly Kings to judge their subjects, and to
dispense rewards and punishments: so God being
the supreme Soveraign, will judge all his sub|jects;
Kings are but Gods Vicegerents, they rule
under him, and they must give an account unto
him; God wil judge the Judges of the Earth: men
do often judge unrighteously, sometimes through
their own wickedness and partiality; sometimes
through ignorance and false information; the
righteous are condemned by some, and notorious
offenders are acquitted; and those which judge
most righteously, cannot finde out all that should
fall under the lash of the Law, and the strictest
laws of men do not reach all offences against
God; therefore there is need that the Soveraign
Lord and King should call the whole world to
another judgement, which will be at the last day.</P>
<P>3. From Gods most <HI>excellent Wisdom</HI> in the
mannagement of his government over the chil|dren
of men; the wisdom of God now is much
out of sight, and is little taken notice of in the
world: there seems now to be a great disorder
and confusion in the government of men; the
most faithful subjects of the King of Heaven in
most places are trodden under foot, and have
many bitter cups put into their hands; and the
most vile Traitors and Rebels, against the highest
Majesty, are lifted up into the seat of honour, and
spend much of their daies in mirth and jollity;
<PB N="205" REF="107">
we read in Scripture of the various and great af|flictions
of Gods People. <HI>Heb. 11. 36, 37.</HI> Some
there were <HI>mocked, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ourged, and tortured, they
were sawen asunder, they were slain with the Sword,
they wandered about in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins,
being destitute, afflicted and tormented,</HI> and yet such
as the <HI>World was not worthy of;</HI> whereas it is said of
the wicked, <HI>Psal. 73. 5, 7, 10. Their eyes stand out
with fatness, they have more than heart could wish, and
Waters of a full Cup are wrung out unto them; and
they are not in trouble like other Men, neither are
they plagued like other Men.</HI> See also <HI>Psal. 17. 14.
Iob 31. from the 7. vers. to the 14th.</HI></P>
<P>So that if there were not another Judgment,
God would seem to have been an ill-contriver of
Government for the welfare of his people, and to
have ill-consulted his own glory in the World;
yea his enemies would seem to have out-wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ted
him; therefore it is needful there should be a day
of Judgment, when all things shall be set at rights,
and put in order; when Gods wisdome all along
shall plainly appear in the view of all, and his
glory be made manifest; when his people shall be
exalted, and his enemies debased.</P>
<P>4. From the infinite holiness of God, now the
holiness of God is trampled under foot by ungodly
sinners; they scorn and deride it, whereever they
see any Image or apearance thereof; they scoff at
the name of a Saint; they hate holiness, and
many do their uttermost to banish it the World;
which is a high affront, which such Persons offer to
the highest Majesty in this high attribute; it is
therefore necessary that there should be a day of
Judgment, that God may redeem the honour of
his holiness, which now lies under such contempt;
<PB N="206" REF="108">
then he will make his holiness to shine with an a|mazing
excellency in the eyes of all those that did
despise it.</P>
<P>5. From Gods <HI>justice and righteousness;</HI> God
hath given unto Man a most just and righteous
Law, and annexed threatnings of everlasting pu|nishment,
which he will inflict upon the breakers
thereof; Gods justice cannot be satisfied without
execution of his vengeance in the punishment of
all transgressors, except it be of such who have an
interest in the satisfaction, which was made by the
Lord Jesus Christ; and all the Children of <HI>Adam</HI>
being transgressours, and very few of them having
an interest in Christ and his merits, and none re|ceiving
condigne punishment for their sins in this
life; therefore there will be a day for the revela|tion
of the just and righteous judgment of God,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 5. This righteousness of God doth engage
him not only to punish the wicked for their sins,
but also to give his people that reward which the
Lord Jesus Christ hath purchased and prepared for
them; therefore there must be a day for him to
do it in.</P>
<P>Thus it doth appear, that there will be a day of
general Judgment.</P>
<P>2. That Christ will be the Judge, is also evident
from Scripture, <HI>Acts 17. 31. He hath appointed a
day wherein he will judge the World in righteousness by
the Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given
assurance unto all Men, in that he hath raised him from
the dead.</HI> And <HI>Rom. 14. 10. We shall all stand be|fore
the Iudgment Seat of Christ.</HI> And 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 10.
<HI>For we must all appear before the Iudgment Seat of
Christ, that every one may receive the things done in
his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be
<PB N="207" REF="108">
good or bad.</HI> And Christs judicial proceedings is set
forth at large, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. Hence then it follows,
that the Lord Jesus Christ shall certainly appear
to Judgment. I might add other Arguments drawn
from the faith, and hope, and expectation of the
righteous, and Christs faithfulness, love, and the
engagement of his honour to appear again, but so
much concerning the certainty of Christs second
appearance.</P>

<P>3. <HI>THe third thing proved, is to shew that the Lord
Iesus Christ will quickly appear,</HI> that is,
1. He will come within a short time. 2. He will
come suddenly and unexpectedly, when he doth
appear.</P>
<P>1. Christ will come quickly, that is, <HI>within a
short time. Heb. 10. 37. Yet a little while, and he
that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</HI> He that
shall come will come, there is the <HI>certainty</HI> of his
coming, and yet a little while, he will come, and
will not tarry, there is the <HI>speediness</HI> of his coming.
<HI>The Lord is at hand, Philip. 4. 5. The coming of the
Lord draweth nigh, Iames 5. 8. The Iudge standeth
at the door, vers. 9. The end of all things is at hand,

world are come, 1 Cor.</HI> 10. 11. We live in the end
of the World, in the last dayes, in the old age
thereof. The World hath as it were three ages,
the youth, the middle age, and the old age; the
Youth of the World was from the creation to the
Flood; the middle age from the Flood to the first
<PB N="208" REF="109">
coming of Christ; the old Age from the first com|ing
of Christ, to the second coming, the old age and
last dayes of the World began in the Apostles
time, now many of them are spent, and we are
come not only to the declining years, but also to
the decrepit age of the World; and if the Lord
Jesus Christ were to come shortly in the dayes of
the Apostle, much more shortly will he come now,
when so many years are past since the Scripture
was writ, and these things foretold.</P>
<P>If any should doubt of the certainty of Christs
appearance, because the Scripture speaks of the
speediness thereof, as if Christ had been in those
dayes presently to come, and yet above sixteen
hundred yeares are past, since the promise was
made.</P>
<P>I answer, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> who in his first
Epistle to the <HI>Thessalenians</HI> spake of Christs coming,
as if it might be in his time, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 4. 16, 17.
<HI>The Lord himself will descend from Heaven with a
sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t, &amp;c. And the dead in Christ shall rise first;
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
in the Clouds, &amp;c.</HI> The same Apostle tells the
<HI>Thessalonians</HI> in his second Epistle, <HI>Chap. 2. 3. Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
the day of the Lord should not come, till there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

&amp;c.</HI> And <HI>vers.</HI> 7. That there was then a lett to
the Revelation of the Man of sin, which was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Heathenish <HI>Romane</HI> Empire, which lett was not
likely in haste, neither was removed till some hun|dred
of years after; and therefore it is eviden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
from that place, that the coming of the Lord was
not to be until several ages after the writing of the
Scriptures. This may be sufficient to give satisfa|ction
concerning the length of time, since the
<PB N="209" REF="109">
Scripture tells us that the Lord Jesus would
quickly appear.</P>
<P>If any profane Mockers shall scoff at this an|swer,
and say, where is the Promise of his coming?
Do not all things remain as they were since the
Creation? Do not the Sun, and Moon, and Stars
keep their constant course? And what likelihood
of the darkning of the Sun, and falling of the
Stars, and the passing away of the Heavens with a
great noise? Is not the Earth established upon sure
foundations, and what likelihood of moving it
and burning it, with the works which are upon it?
and if Christ would have come so quickly, would
not he have been here before now? I answer,</P>
<P>1. That the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> foretels, that in the
last days such scoffers should arise. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 3, 4.</P>
<P>2. That all things are not as they were from the
Creation, for the World in the time of <HI>Noah</HI> was
drowned with the Flood, <HI>Noah</HI> only excepted,
and those which were with him in the Ark; surely
there was a great transformation of things in that
age, <HI>vers.</HI> 5, 6.</P>
<P>3. That by the same word of command, where|by
the old World was drowned with Water, by
the same Word, the World that now is shall be
burned with <HI>Fire at the day of Iudgment and perdi|tion
of the ungodly,</HI> vers. 7.</P>
<P>4. That though many hundred years be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st
since the promise, that the Lord would come quick|ly,
yet there is not a failure, in regard of God; for
though the time be long, in regard of our account,
who are of so short continuance; and time seems
tedious to us, because of the miseries of our short
life; yet in regard of the eternal God, the time
is but short, for in his sight <HI>a thousand years is but
<PB N="210" REF="110">
as one day,</HI> and by that account there are not yet
two dayes past since the promise. <HI>vers.</HI> 8.</P>
<P>5. The reason of Gods protracting this appea|rance
of Jesus Christ to Judgment, is for our
sakes; it is from his long-suffering to us-ward,
that hereby he might lead us unto repentance,
<HI>vers.</HI> 9. The Lord hath a number to be called,
some of which may be unborn, others not yet new|born,
but scattered amongst the wicked; but when
the Elect are all called, and perswaded to repent,
and believe, and are gathered into Gods Family,
I doubt not but the Lord Jesus Christ will be here
immediately. The Lord Jesus surely now will
come within a short time; the certain time of his
appearance is unknown, <HI>Matth. 24. 36. But of
that day and hour knoweth no Man, no not the
Angels, but the Father only;</HI> this is a secret which
God hath locked up in his own breast, it is writ|ten
in the Book of this Decree, and however other
things are revealed and unfolded to Men, yet the
leaf where this is written is folded up and sealed,
so that none can read it; yet surely it cannot be
long before the mystery be finished, and Christ
be revealed from Heaven; yet a little while and
he will be here, he stands at the Door, and the
Door will quickly be opened, and then he will
make his appearance.</P>
<P>2. The Lord Jesus Christ will come quickly,
that is suddenly, and unexpectedly, especially in
regard of the ungodly World. <HI>The day of the Lord
will come as a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">re upon all them that dwell on the
face of the whole Earth: L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ke 21. 34, 35. And sud|den
destruction will then come upon the wicked, as pains
<PB N="211" REF="110">
on a Woman with Childe: 1 Thess.</HI> 5. 3. The Lord
will come <HI>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye:
1 Cor. 15. 52. As lightning cometh out of the East,
and shineth unto the West, so shall the coming of the
Son of Man be: Matth.</HI> 24. 27. Further, this
coming of the Lord Jesus is set forth in Scri|pture.</P>
<P>1. By the coming of a Thief in the night, <HI>Rev.
16. 15. Behold I come as a Thief: 1 Thess.</HI> 5. 2.
<HI>For your selves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord
so cometh as a Thief in the night: 2 Pet. 3. 10. The
day of the Lord cometh as a Thief in the night, in
which the Heavens shall pass away with a great
noise, &amp;c.</HI> The Lord will not come like a Thief,
in regard of any wicked purpose and design; but
he will come like a Thief, in regard of the sud|denness
and unexpectedness of his coming. Men
do not think of, they do not know of, they are not
aware of, they do not desire the coming of Thieves:
so the Lord will come at a time, which Men do
not know of, when they do not think of it, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
they are not aware of it; and he will be more un|welcome
at his second appearance to the greatest
part of the World, than a Thief, who comes sud|denly
in the night, and breaks in upon their Hou|ses,
to steal their goods, and take away their
lives; when the Lord Jesus shall suddenly unfold
the Doors of Heaven, and come down in his glo|ry,
and summon the wicked to Judgment, how
will they start, and be affrighted out of their deep
sleep of security, and be filled with horrour and
amazement!</P>
<P>2. Christs coming is set forth by the coming of
a Bridegroom at midnight, in the Parable of the
ten Virgins, <HI>Matth. 25. 6. At midnight there was
<PB N="212" REF="111">
a cry made, Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go yee
forth to meet him.</HI> The Virgins were all asleep,
the wise as well as the foolish, they did not expect
the Bridegroom at that time; the coming of Christ
will be sudden and unexpected, as to the particu|lar
time unto his own Disciples; yet they will
quickly arise, and trim their Lamps, and receive
him with joy, when the Lamps of the foolish Vir|gins,
for want of Oile, will go out, and they shall
be shut out of the Bride-chamber of Heaven for
ever.</P>
<P>3. Christs coming is set forth by the coming of
the Flood upon the old World, and <HI>Noah</HI>'s en|tering
into the Ark: <HI>Luke 17. 26, 27. And as it
was in the dayes of Noah, so shall it be in the dayes of
the Son of Man; They did eat, they drank, they
married Wives; they were given in marriage, until the
day that Noah entered into the Ark, and the Flood
came and destroyed them all.</HI> The old World was
very licentious, and secure in the dayes of <HI>Noah;</HI>
though universal ruines and destruction were so
neer, yet it being a thing which was unseen, they
did not expect it, nor take any care to prevent it.
It is said of <HI>Noah, Heb.</HI> 11. 7. That <HI>by faith being
warned of God, of things not seen as yet, moved with
fear, he prepared an Ark to the saving of his house:</HI>
By faith he knew that the Flood would come, when
there was no appearance of it, nor possibility, in
regard of the ordinary way of the working of se|cond
causes; he believed it, because God who
could effect it, and who cannot lie, had foretold
it; and therefore he prepared, according to Gods
direction, this great Vessel, to defend himself
and Family, and some living Creatures of every
kinde, against the Waters, which he foresaw were
<PB N="213" REF="111">
coming upon the Earth; but the ungodly World,
having no eye of faith, could not discern this un|seen
thing; it is most likely they heard often of it
by <HI>Noah,</HI> who was a Preacher of righteousness;
but they did not believe it, therefore they did not
expect it, nor fear it, nor prepare for it: they are,
and drank, and slept, and sin'd as if no such thing
had been coming upon them: It is likely, when
they saw <HI>Noah</HI> build the Ark, such a large and ca|pacious
Vessel, on the dry Land, that they scoffed
at him, and accounted him no better than a mad|man,
as we should do a Man that should build a
Ship on the top of a Mountain, and expect
that Waters should come up thither, and waft it
away.</P>
<P>But when the dayes of a hundred and twenty
years, which the Lord had appointed the old World
to continue, after his threatning of their destructi|on,
were expired; when the decree had brought
forth, and the year of Gods recompence was
come, and the day of his fierce anger, wherein
he sent the Flood upon the Earth, O the terrour
and amazement which did surprize the secure sin|ners
of the World at that time! when the Win|dows
of Heaven were opened from above, out of
which God looked forth upon sinners, with such a
furious countenance, and poured forth his anger in
such streames of water; and the Fountains of the
great deep were opened from beneath, and the
Flood began to arise, and lift up the head, and
swell about them; when the Valleys were filled
with running Waters, and the Plains were co|vered,
as if they had been a Sea; when this ene|my
did combine so many Forces together (ha|ving
a Commission from God to destroy) and
<PB N="214" REF="112">
strengthned it self on every side, and environed
these rebellious sinners round about, and assailed
them in every quarter; when not only smaller
Cortages were overturned, but also the streames
brake in with irresiftible force upon the strongest
and greatest edifices; when great Doors were lift|ed
off of their hinges, or broken to pieces, and
the Water (like a Thief) climbed in at the Win|dows,
and roaring all about with a hideous noise,
pursued those which fled from it, following them
up stairs, even to the highest room until it had o|vertaken
them, and devoured them without mer|cy;
think what a hurry and affright the World
was in at that time; how every one shifted for
himself, if possible, to preserve himself from the
fury of this Conqueror; how they forsook the
lower grounds, and flocked together to the Hill-Countreys
in great haste, leaving their substance
behinde them, with a sad heart; how they were
drenched with the Rain from Heaven, and wet
to the skin as they went along, and scarcely were
able to take breath, the stormes was so impetu|ous
about them; and when they perceived the
Flood to beset the highest Mountains, (whither
some of them were fled, and upon the top of
which some of them had climbed, hoping (it may
be) that they had got unto an inaccessible place) &amp;
that the billows were mounting towards them; &amp;
now the whole World seeth their death and ruine
to be inevitable, that there was no contending with,
no resisting or flying from these armed Waters,
which God had sent to execute his vengeance upon
them for their sins; we may imagine something of
the horrible perplexitie of their mindes: O how did
they look one upon another, when such a judgment as
<PB N="215" REF="112">
this was come upon them, which they never loo|ked
for! how did they speak! how did they
weep! how did they cry and shreek! what di|stress
was there then upon all Nations, and how
did their hearts fail them, and sink within them
through fear, when they looked upon the flood
that was come upon the earth; when they heard
the winds blowing, and waves roaring, and saw
no way of escaping? Then they which had heard
<HI>Noah</HI> foretell and threaten them with this judg|ment,
too late believed the truth of his words,
which before they did not regard; then they
which had seen <HI>Noah</HI> build the Ark, and had
accounted him no better than mad, were con|vinced
of their own folly and madness, that
they did not with him take some course for the
defence of themselves at this time; then they
were perswaded of <HI>Noah's</HI> wisdome above all o|thers
on the earth, and could have wished that
they had imitated his wisdom, in building for
themselves such another Ark, or that they were
with him in his; and possibly some, when the
waters were come, and <HI>Noah</HI> was shut in by God
in his Ark, might run to the place and endeavour
to clamber into it, and be washed off with the
stream.</P>
<P>Thus will it be at the second comming of the
Lord Jesus Christ to judgement, his coming will
be sudden and unexpected: the wicked of the
earth will be eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage; they will be as sensual and
sinful, and as secure withal, as they are at this
day; they are told frequently, by the preaching
of the word, that the day of judgment is appoin|ted,
and that it hastneth greatly; that the Lord
<PB N="216" REF="113">
Jesus Christ will come, and that he will come
quickly; but they want faith to believe it, and
therefore they do not expect it, nor fear it, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
prepare for it: It is said, <HI>Luke</HI> 18. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">8. <HI>When the
Son of man cometh, shall he finde faith on the earth?</HI>
Some interpret this place as spoken not of Christs
second personal coming to judgement; but of
his comming in a way of eminent deliverance of
his people from the cruelty and oppression of their
enemies, which will be so strange and unexpect|ed,
because they shall be brought so low, insomuch
that there will hardly be faith in any to believe a
desiverance. Others interpret this place, as spea|king
of Christs last appearance to judgment; that
the earth will then be generally secure, and that
wicked men, and unbelievers, and oppressours of
Gods people will abound, and that true belie|vers
will be rare, and very hardly to be found:
I shall not determine which is the true sense of
the place, but sure I am the wicked will be many,
and very secure at the day of Christ's appearance;
though the wicked be forewarned of this day, yet
they do not believe this thing, than which nothing
is more certain; the wicked, which are mingled
amongst Gods people, think strange that they do
not run with them unto the same excess of riot;
they looke upon them as no better than fools,
and people besides themselves, when they see
them deny themselves, sleight the pleasures and
profits, and vanities of the world, and are so
iollicitous above all other things to prepare an
Ark for the saving of their souls, to get an in|terest
in Jesus Christ, typified by the Ark, that
under his shelter they may be defended from
the storm of Gods wrath, which shall beat upon
<PB N="217" REF="113">
the head of the wicked at the last day. The
wicked do expect Christ's comming no more
than the old world did the Flood in the daies of
<HI>Noah.</HI></P>
<P>But when the time which the Lord hath ap|pointed
the world to continue, is expired, and the
Angel hath lifted up his hand to Heaven, and
sworn by him that liveth for ever and ever, that
time shall be no longer; when the mystery of God
is finished, and all the things to be done in the
world are accomplished, and the day of judg|ment
of old ordained, is now come, and Christ
hath received his commission from his Father to
summon all to his judgment seat: O the dread
that will on that day fall upon the wicked tribes
of the earth! when they shall see the heavens
opened above, and such a glorious Majesty, with
such a glorious Train appear in the air; and
when the earth and the graves shall be open
beneath, and all the dead bodies of all genera|tions
shall be raised and come forth, and some
of them shall be caught up to meet the Lord in
the clouds, and themselves with the most to be
left behind; and when they feel the wrath of
God to begin to assaile them like a flood, and
to be poured into their souls like water; when
they see Christ coming in flaming fire to take
vengeance upon them for their sins: O this will
be an unexpected and terrible appearance, and
so much the more retrible, by how much the less
expected: Then they will not endeavour to climb
up mountains, but to creep under them to hide
them from the wrath of the Lamb, but all to no
purpose, no mountain will receive them, for all
the mountains, and earth it self, with the hea|vens,
<PB N="218" REF="114">
will flee away from the face of the Lord
Jesus Christ, when his Throne is set for Judg|ment,
<HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 11. they will then looke about
them, and perceive all refuge to fail them, and
no way of escaping for them; then they will
with grief remember the warnings which they
had of these things, and be vexed at the very
heart that they did not take warning; then they
will wish for an Ark; and O that they had an in|terest
in Jesus Christ! and they will account be|lievers,
whom once they esteemed as fools and
mad men, to have been the wisest people upon
the earth; and O that they were in their con|dition!
possibly some may endeavour to clamber
up into the air with them, when they are ascen|ding
to their Lord; but they will have weights
sufficient to keep them down. The dread of sinners
at the last day, when Christ doth come so suddenly
and unexpectedly will be far greater than the
dread of the old world in the daies of the Flood.</P>
<P>4. And lastly, to name no more, the suddenness
and unexpectedness of Christs coming is set
forth by the raining of Fire and Brimstone from
Heaven upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> and <HI>Lots</HI> going out of that
wicked place, <HI>Luke 17. 28, 29, 30. Likewise as it
was in the daies of Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, they did eat, they drank,
they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded:
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodome, it rai|ned
Fire and Brimstone from Heaven, and destroyed
them all: Even thus shall it be in the day when the
Son of man shall be revealed.</HI> The <HI>Sodomites</HI> were
notoriously wicked, they were worse than beasts,
they would have offered violence, and buggered
the very Angels which were sent to <HI>Lot;</HI> they
were generally wicked, there were not so many
<PB N="219" REF="114">
as ten righteous persons in the place, though
righteous <HI>Lot</HI> dwelt amongst them; it is likely
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">here was not one righteous person, besides what
was in <HI>Lots</HI> family; and though they were so
wicked, and the cry of their sins was gone up
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o Heaven, and the Lord was provoked unto so
great displeasure by them; yet they are jovial
and secure; they did not think in the midst of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">heir peace, that sudden destruction was so near;
<HI>Abraham</HI> with his servants had not long before
delivered them out of the hand of <HI>Chedorlaomer,</HI>
(against whom they had rebelled) and <HI>Amraphel,</HI>
and the other Kings which had conquered them,
and sackt the place; they did not think of a more
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urious enemy, who was arming himself against
them, even the King of Heaven, against whom
they had worse rebelled, and out of whose hands
none could deliver them: They ate, and they
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rank, they did not think that their flesh, and all
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he provisions thereof should so soon be devoured
by flames; they bought, and they sold, they did little
expect that both money and merchandize should
be consumed so suddenly; they planted and they
builded, they did not in the least imagine that
instead of showers of Rain from Heaven to wa|ter
their Plants, to make them grow, they should
have showers of Fire and Brimstone to burn up
their plants, and burn down their houses to the
ground. The Sodomites did not in the least look
for such a Judgment as this: it is said, <HI>Gen. 19. 14.
That Lot went out and spake to his sons in law, which
had married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f this place, for the Lord will destroy this City: but
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.</HI> His
words were unto them like idle tales, which they
<PB N="220" REF="115">
did not believe, otherwaies they would not have
remained in the place until they had been con|sumed;
and if <HI>Lot's</HI> sons in Law, (who in like|lihood
were some of the best of the place) did
not believe nor expect the judgment, though
they were forewarned by their Father; much less
did the rest of the <HI>Sodomites</HI> expect it, that had
not before heard of it. This Fire from Heaven
was altogether unexpected in <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it
rained Fire and Brimstone upon them, and destroyed
them all.</HI> The morning was clear, when <HI>Lot</HI> went
forth, and the Sun did shine with a glorious
brightness, when he got into <HI>Zoar;</HI> but then we
may imagine that a strange darkness did quickly
fill the Heavens, when the Lord came down clothed
with vengeance as with a garment, and wrapped
in thick clouds of the sky; when the Lord thun|dered
in the Heavens, and the highest gave hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
voice, Hail-stones and coals of fire; when the Lord
rained Fire and Brimstone upon the place; Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
can utter the horrible perpexity of the <HI>Sodomite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
on that day, under this unthought of, unexpe|cted,
sudden, and so dreadful un-heard-of Judg|ment?
when they opened their windows and
doors of their houses in the morning, and per|ceived
the fashion of the heavens to be altered
and the tempest of Fire and Brimstone to beat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
upon them so sorely and suddenly; when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
was strangely converted into fire, and such scal|ding
sulphurious matter enkindled by the brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
of God did fall upon them; when the whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
place was put into flames together, and ever
house was set on Fire by this Fire from Heaven
when they saw if the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> went forth of doors
<PB N="221" REF="115">
they should be burnt by the fire of Heaven,
if they stayed within, they should be burnt by the
fire of their houses; when there was such a dreadful
burning heat by the Fire, accompanied with such
a stinking, noisome, suffocating smoke by the
brimstone; when there was a little kinde of Hell in
that place both for torment and sin; O the Dread
of the <HI>Sodomites</HI> at that time! then those beasts
which would have forced themselves into <HI>Lots</HI>
doors, to commit leudness, and were strucken by the
Angels with blindness, when they began to feel
the violence of this Fire, and their pampered
flesh began to be rosted by these flames, how did
they howle like Dogs, how did they roar and
yell with anguish and horrour? Then all the sin|ners
of the place, whose sins before went up with
such a loud cry into the ears of God, what a loud
cry did they send forth out of every house under
the sense of their torments? then the sons in law
of <HI>Lot,</HI> who were forewarned, I believe, were
above others perplexed and filled with unspeak|able
vexation, that they did not hearken to the
voice of their Father, and remove with him from
that place before the Fire came; then they knew
he did not mock them, but was in good earnest,
and that his words were not idle tales, but the
truth of Gods intention, which he was sent to
give them notice of: <HI>Sodom</HI> is now made a fiery
Furnace, and all the wicked of the place are
consumed together suddenly and unexpectedly.</P>
<P><HI>Even thus will it be in the day when the Son of
Man shall be revealed,</HI> when the Lord Jesus Christ
shall come to Judgment. The world is very
wicked, and the longer it doth continue, the worse
it grows; the sins of the wicked world, like the
<PB N="222" REF="116">
sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> have gone up with a loud Cry to
God; and the Lord hath exercised his patience a
long time to lead them unto repentance; and if
there had not been some righteous persons on the
Earth, the day of Judgment would have been
long ago; if there had not been some <HI>Lots</HI> in <HI>Sodom,</HI>
I mean some Elect Persons in their sins, that are
yet to be called, and some as yet un-born, that
must be gathered, the World would ere this have
been consumed, for the wickedness thereof; there
is a measure appointed for the Worlds sins, which
will be filled up, and there is a number appointed
of chosen Persons, who ere long will be brought
in, and so soon as <HI>Lot</HI> is got into <HI>Zoar,</HI> God rains
Fire and Brimstone on <HI>Sodom;</HI> and I conceive that
so soon as all the Elect Persons are got into Christ,
that then Christ will appear to Judgment; and as
it was in the dayes of <HI>Lot,</HI> so will it be on the
day of Christs appearance; the wicked of the
World will be secure, eating and drinking, buy|ing
and selling, planting and building.</P>
<P>The day before Christ cometh will be a <HI>merry
day</HI> with some ungodly sinners, they will be eating
and drinking, feasting and carouzing, singing and
rejoycing, and putting the evil day far from them,
even when it is so very neer; but how will their
chear be changed the next morning? how will their
singing be turned into howling, and their joy into
heaviness and dreadful terrour?</P>
<P>The day before will be a <HI>gainfull day,</HI> it may be
with many in their buying and selling, possibly
they may have got a good bargain in their buying,
and got good profit in their selling; and it may be
a <HI>busie day</HI> with others in their planting and build|ing,
which may fill their time and thoughts with
<PB N="223" REF="116">
Worldly care and contrivements for many years
to come, little thinking that the World is not of a
years, nor two dayes standing longer; but O what
terrour will seize upon these Worldings the next
morning, when Christ doth appear to judge them!
and they finde, that whilst they have gained some|thing
in the World, which they cannot now keep,
and will yield no profit in this day of wrath, that
they have lost their souls and happiness for ever,
which they cannot regain; that whilst they have
been busie about trifles, they have neglected the
one thing necessary; then they will wish, that in|stead
of planting Trees in their Ground, they had
spent their time in getting grace planted in their
hearts; that instead of building Houses for their
bodies, they had laid a good foundation for this
time, and got a title to the building of God,
the House not made with hands, which is durable
and eternal.</P>
<P>The day before Christs coming will be a
<HI>sinning-day</HI> with all the wicked, and a <HI>day of
general security;</HI> some will be swearing and cur|sing,
others will be oppressing and grinding the
faces of the poor, others will be reproaching and
persecuting of Gods people; and the very night
before, it may be many wicked Persons may be got
together Carding, and Dicing, and Drinking all
night unto Drunkenness, and others may be got
into the unclean Bed, and there lie in their filthi|ness,
and all will be sleeping in sin and security;
but the sound of the last Trumpet will startle and
awaken them all; when sinners open their eyes
on this morning, and see the Heavens open before
them, and the Lord Jesus Christ descend in such
glory as hath been described, none can utter what
<PB N="224" REF="117">
their perplexity will be at that day; and the sud|denness
of Christs coming will make their horrour
the greater; some of them were told of this day
of Fire, when the Heavens should pass away with
a great noise, and the Elements should melt with
fervent heat, and the Earth (with the works therof)
should be burnt up, and what course they should
take, to escape the vengeance of this day; they
were perswaded to leave their sins, to flee from the
wrath to come, to hasten out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> if they
would not be consumed in its flames, to get away,
and not look back, to flee presently into <HI>Zoar,</HI>
where only they could be hid, to get into the City
of refuge, if they would escape the vengeance
which did pursue them, which had them upon the
chase; they were invited into Gods Family, and
into the armes of his mercy; they were invited
unto Christ, and to partake of his grace freely;
they were told again, and again, if they did go
on in the way of sin, that iniquity would be their
ruine, that so long as they did abide in a state of
impenitency and unbelife, that the wrath of God
did abide on them; they were told how sweet:
Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ was, and how ready
he would be to receive them, if they applyed
themselves by faith, with repentance for sin unto
him; and they were told how furious and inexo|rable
a Judge he would be, and what vengeance
he would take upon them at the last day, if they
did not take warning in the day of grace, which
they had allowed them; they were told that Hell
Fire was very hot and intollerable, and that Hea|vens
pleasures were very sweet, and most desirable,
and they were earnestly entreated to fly from the
former, and accept of the latter, upon the most
<PB N="225" REF="117">
reasonable termes, on which they were proffered:
But they were like <HI>Lot</HI>'s Sons in Law, they did
not believe: Ministers which warned them, seem'd
in their eyes, as if they had mocked them, their
words seemed like idle tales; whatever haste the
<HI>Lots</HI> made out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> they would not stir;
they did not look after a <HI>Zoar</HI> to flie unto; they
hugged their sins, and would not leave them;
they heard of Christ, but they neglected, slighted,
refused him; they did not apprehend such need,
which they had of a Saviour; they were fearless
of future wrath, and careless of the salvation and
happiness of their souls. But when Christ doth
come down so suddenly and unexpectedly to judge
and condemn them, and shall cast them into the
Lake, which burns with Fire and Brimstone;
then they will remember these things with vexa|tion,
far greater than that of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Sons in Law,
(when Fire and Brimstone was rained from Hea|ven
upon them) who would not hearken to the
counsel of their Father to escape it.</P>

<P>THe Lord Jesus Christ will certainly and quick|ly

<P>The day is appointed by the eternal and unalte|rable
decree of God, and he hath revealed the
thing, though not the time, in his word of truth;
the day approacheth, it cannot be far off; time is
flying away upon swift wings; the day of the
World is almost spent, the shaddowes of its even|ing

little while, and Christ will be here; he will ap|pear
in his glory; never did eye of Man behold
such glory and majesty in the greatest earthly Po|tentate,
as will be seen in the Lord Jesus Christ
on this day; all the state, and pomp, and splendor,
and glittering glory, which some Princes have been
decked withall in their Triumphant showes, is no
more to be compared with the pomp and splendor
of the Lord Jesus Christ in this appearance, than
the shining of a Candle, or Glow-worm, or rotten
stick in the night, is to be compared with the shi|ning
of the Sun in its noon-day glory: Ere long
the great Gates of Heaven will lift up their heads,
and those everlasting Doors (within which Christ
doth, for the present, remain) will be opened;
and then this King of Glory will come forth, and
come down with marvellous splendour and bright|ness
of Majesty; It is said, <HI>Psal. 47. 5. God is
gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of the
Trumpet;</HI> then God will come down with a shout,
the Lord with the sound of a Trumpet, 1 <HI>Thess.
4. 16. The Chariots of the Lord are twenty thousand,
even thousands of Angels: Psal.</HI> 68. 17. All the
holy Angels shall attend upon him, and blow the
Trumpet before him, at this last Assizes, to awa|ken
and summon on the World to judgment: then
the Sun in the Firmament will be darkned, when
this more glorious Sun doth appear; then the
whole frame of Heaven will shake, and the foun|dations
of the Earth will be moved, the everlast|ing
Mountains will bow, and the perpetual Hills
will shrink; yea the Heavens will pass away with
a great noise, and like a skroll be rolled together,
and the Elements will melt with fervent heat, and
the Earth w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">l be on Fire, and every Mountain
<PB N="227" REF="118">
and Island will flee away from before his face;
then the Sea will roar, and all living Creatures,
likely, will be in a strange consternation; then
the wicked Tribes of the Earth will mourn, and the
Saints will rejoyce at this glorious appearance of
the great God, and their Saviour.</P>
<P>But who will be alive on this glorious day?
who will be the Spectators of these great things?
whose eyes shall behold this blessed sight? who
shall see the Lord Jesus come in such glory? many
Kings and Prophets, and righteous Men desired
to-see Christ come in the flesh, and did not see
him; and to hear the things which he taught, but
they did not obtain their desire; many Generations
were asleep in their Graves before Christs first ap|pearance;
the righteous saw him afar off, and
darkly, in types and figures; few lived in the
dayes when our Saviours abode was upon the
Earth; he had not many Disciples whom he made
happy with his personal acquaintance and abode
with them; A great access there hath been since
Christs departure unto the Church, who though
they have loved him, and believed in him, yet they
never saw him with bodily eyes: Three things one
desired to see, <HI>Christ</HI> in the flesh, <HI>Paul</HI> in the
Pulpit, and <HI>Rome</HI> in its glory; but past things are
fled out of sight, and the wishes of such things are
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o no purpose; death hath closed the eyes of ma|ny
millions of Christs Disciples, who have heard
the report of him, but never saw him: And is not
their hopes of seeing Christ perished in the Graves

seen? the righteous indeed which remain, when
Christ doth come down, will be happy, when
they see their Lord in the aire, but if we die be|fore
the time, what shall we be the better?</P>
<P>Beloved, let me tell you, or rather believe the
Word of God, which doth tell you, that all of you
will be spectators of the great things which shall
come to pass at the last day; all Generations of
Men and Women that ever lived upon the face of
the Earth, and are sleeping in the dust, shall then
be awakened, and raised, and be alive together,
and you shall be found alive amongst them: that
which our Saviour spake to the chief Priests and
Elders of the <HI>Iewes,</HI> before whom he was accused,
and stood as a Prisoner. <HI>Hereafter yee shall see the
Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and
coming in the Clouds of Heaven: Matth.</HI> 26. 64.
The same may I say unto all you that hear me this
day, hereafter yee shall see the Son of Man com|ing
in the Clouds of Heaven: <HI>Rev. 1. 7. Behold he
cometh with Clouds, and every eye shall see him.</HI> These
very eyes with which you look upon me, or one
upon another, shall see the Lord Jesus Christ
come in the aire; these very cares with which you
hear me preach this Doctrine unto you, shall hear
the sound of the last Trumpet, and the great shout
with which Christ will descend out of his Fathers
Pallace into this inferiour World; these very bo|dies
which are standing or sitting in this place, must
stand before Christs Tribunal Seat at the last
Day.</P>
<P><HI>Death hath a Commission from God</HI> to pull you
out of your habitations, and drag your bodies into
its Prison, and this enemy is upon the way, and

<PB N="229" REF="119">
to your Doors you do not know; his arrows are
flying about your eares, and you will be smitten
sooner or later, either when you are younger or
older, none can escape his stroke; your time is

will be expiring your last breath, and these bodies
which you are cloathing, and feeding, and provi|ding

And as certain as Death, so certain will your Re|surrection
be at Christs coming. <HI>Christ hath re|ceived
a Commission from God</HI> to judge the World,
and he will come down from Heaven with the
Keyes of Death and Hell, and open the Doores,
where you shall have your lodging, and bring you
forth to judgment; I must awake on that day, if
I fall asleep into my Grave before, and arise, and
give an account of my self, and the souls commit|ted
to my charge, unto my Lord and Master; and
you must awake also, and give an account of your
selves and actions, unto the glorious Judge; your
lives then will be reviewed, your actions will be
examined, and it will be known then what you
have been doing ever since you came into the
World, how you have spent your time, how you
have improved the seasons and means of grace;
then it will appear who are Christs sheep, and
who the Goats, however they now flock together
sometimes in one company; who are wise, and
who the foolish Virgins, however now all have
Lamps shining; then it will be known who have
been wise unto salvation, who have made their
peace with God in the way, who have furnished
their hearts with grace, laid up their treasure in
Heaven, and improved their talents for their Ma|sters

use upon the Earth, and who have foolishly
slipt and sinned away the harvest, and day of grace,
neglecting Christ, and the things which belonged
to their peace and happiness, until they were hid
from their eyes, who have been hypocrites and
unbelievers, and served divers lusts, instead of
serving the Lord of life and glory; and all ungod|ly
sinners will be found out and punished: then
all of you, yea the whole World will believe the
doctrine, which we now preach concerning the va|nity
of the Creatures, the evil of sin, the neces|siry
of Christ, the excellency of grace, the happi|ness
of Gods Children; and O what will the par|don
of sin, the favour of God, the least measure of
grace be worth then? our Doctrine concerning
these things is as true now, and the worth to Christ
and grace, and salvation as great, though then
Mens valuation will be greater, because the worth
will be more apparent.</P>

in the City, whilst it was yet standing, which have

<P>1. Christ will condemn such as are <HI>carnal;</HI> I
mean such as are in the flesh, such as are in the
state of nature, such as never were regenerated,
or born again by the Word and Spirit, as never
have had experience of a work of grace upon
their hearts; such as are blind, and never had
their eyes opened to see their sin, and their Savi|our,
who are muffled up in the darkness and
hoodwinked with the vail of ignorance and un|belief,
and upon whose eyes there are such thick
scales, that the glorious light of the Gospel hath
never been discerned by them in a spiritual and
saving way; such who are asleep, and never had
their consciences awakened out of their carnal
security, whose consciences are seared as with a

check or controll; such who are dead in sin, and
never were quickned by the Spirit of life; such
as are slaves to their lusts, and under the reig|ning
power of sin, and never were delivered
from this worse than Turkish bondage; that ne|ver
were converted, and savingly changed; ne|ver
were humbled and emptied of themselves,
never truly repented, and mourned for sin, never
were powerfully drawn unto, and savingly clo|sed
with Jesus Christ; that never were renewed
in their minds and hearts, transformed after the
<PB N="233" REF="121">
Image of God, transplanted into the garden of
the Lord, and engrafted into the new stock; such
in whom all old things remain, and are wholly
carnal, in the same state in which they were first
born; their persons will all be condemned by
the Judge, <HI>Iohn 3. 3. Matth. 13. 3. Rom.</HI> 8. 13.

<P>2. Christ will condemn the <HI>sensual:</HI> I mean
such who are so far from denying themselves, cru|cifying
the flesh, mortifying the deeds of the body,
taking up the cross, walking in the narrow way
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">trict obedience, striving to enter in at the
strait gate, which alone can bring unto eternal
life and happiness, and subjugating their thoughts,
wil, &amp; affections unto the government of Christ, and
so living as if they were his servants indeed whose
name they bear; that they labour either to im|prison,
or banish, or hide themselves from the light
of those truths which would reach them these
things, to bribe or muzzle conscience which
would urge them, yea to shake off the government
of reason it self, which would put a curb upon
them, and so give up themselves to licentious|ness,
making provision for the flesh, to fulfil
the lusts thereof with all greediness; such who
are so far degenerated and fallen from that pri|mitive
holiness which nature was endued with at
the first creation, that they have lost the relicts
of Gods Image, and blotted out the characters
of his law engraven upon the hearts of all men,
and have made themselves like beasts, yea more
vile than the beasts that perish; such are they that
are sensual and luxurious, and seek for their chie|fest
<PB N="234" REF="122">
happiness in pleasing their sensual appetites;
such are drunkards, and gluttons, and adulterers,
who wallow in the mire of such sins, who spend
their daies in such pleasures, and gather as much
of them as they can finde, without any regard to
Gods Law, which doth forbid them, or to those
higher, sweeter pleasures which they are capable
of, and might obtain if they did seek after them
in the way which God hath appointed; All these
which fulfil the desires of the flesh are children of
wrath, <HI>Ephes. 3. 3.</HI> and they which please them|selves,
and live deliciously here, will have torment
and sorrow given them by Christ at his appearance,
<HI>Rev. 18. 7. Luke</HI> 6. 25.</P>
<P>3. Christ will condemn the <HI>earthly,</HI> such who
lay up for themselves treasures on earth, and
neglect the heavenly treasure, <HI>Matth.</HI> 6. 19, 20.
who love the world, and things in the world, and
have no true love to the Father, who is the God
of love, and the chief good of mankind, 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2.
15. All covetous worldlings will be condemned
by Jesus Christ for their heart Idolatry, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 5,

and extortioners; earth will be all the
portion of such who make choice of it, no room
will be found for them in the Kingdom of heaven,
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 10.</P>
<P>4. Christ will condemn the <HI>Devilish;</HI> all such
as are children of the devil, as bear his Image,
and do his work, that yield themselves to be his
slaves and servants, and endeavour the promo|tion
of the interest of his Kingdom; all such as
are under the power of Devilish pride, and De|vilish
envy, and Devilish malice; all Devilish
lyars, and Devilish slanderers, and Devilish per|secutors
<PB N="235" REF="122">
of Gods people: In a word, all such per|sons
as live in a course of sin, and never brake
off the trade thereof by repentance, and obtai|ned
a pardon of sin through faith, and yielded
up themselves unto the obedience of the Gos|pel

<P>Beloved, examine your selves seriously hereby,
and what hath been before said, whether you are
not in the number of these persons; whether none
of you are carnal, in a state of nature; whether
none of you, are sensual or earthly; whether
none of you are children of the Devil; whether
none of you are Drunkards, Adulterers,
Liars, slanderers, unjust, unrighteous, and with|all
impenient persons, unbelievers, and chil|dren
of disobedience, against whom the wrath
of God will be revealed, when the Lord Jesus
Christ shall be revealed from Heaven to Judg|ment.</P>
<P>2. <HI>For the awakening of sinners.</HI> Will the
Lord Jesus Christ certainly and quickly appear to
judgment? methinks this doctrine should <HI>awaken</HI>
sleepy sinners, and <HI>arouze</HI> them out of their car|nal
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ecurity. Doth conscience accuse you, and
secretly tell any of you, that you are in the num|ber
of those persons whom the Lord will condemn
at the last day, and sentence unto Hell; me|thinks
it should make you <HI>startle,</HI> and look about
you; methinks it should make your hair stand an
end, and every joynt to tremble; methinks it
should fill you with fear, and imprint such trou|ble
upon your spirits, as would damp all your
<PB N="236" REF="123">
earthly comforts and delights, to confider the
danger which ye are in by reason of sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the guilt
of which doth still lie upon you. Every word of
this Doctrine is awakening.</P>
<P>1 <HI>Awake</HI> sinners, <HI>awake! Christ will appear to
judgment.</HI> Christ will appear, whom you have
read of, and heard of, and have had frequent
proffers of, but could never be prevailed to ac|cept
of; Christ will appear in his glory, in whom
you could see no beauty, or desirableness; Christ
will appear as a <HI>Iudge,</HI> whom you might have
had for your <HI>Saviour.</HI> Sinners, the Judge of the
whole world will appear, and can you sleep un|der
the guilt of sin? He will be a most glorious,
powerful, wise, holy, righteous, strict, furious,
inexorable Judge, as hath been shown from <HI>p.</HI> 65.
to <HI>p.</HI> 73. and yet are you secure and fearless?
you have heard <HI>God's terrible voice in the City,</HI>
and that hath not awakened you; and will not
Christ's appearance to Judgment awaken you
neither? You have been asleep under the sound
of temporal judgments, and can you sleep under
the thoughts of the last judgment, when the pu|nishment,
which shall then be inflicted, will be
eternal?</P>
<P>2. <HI>Awake,</HI> sinners <HI>awake!</HI> Christ will <HI>certainly</HI>
appear to Judgment; if there were only a per|adventure
of Christs coming to Judgment, me|thinks
it should awaken the guilty, but when there
is a certainty of it, how should it awaken you?
as certainly as God is true, as certainly as the Scri|ptures
are his Word, as certainly as you are crea|tures,
and sinners; so certainly will the Lord Je|sus
Christ appear to judge the ungodly World for
sin, at the last day. <HI>England</HI> hath of late been un|der
<PB N="237" REF="123">
the stroke of several temporal Judgments;
and <HI>England</HI> is in danger of further and greater
calamities; God may put a more bitter Cup into
our hands to drink, than yet we have tasted of;
the danger of which should awaken secure sinners,
because <HI>they</HI> cannot promise to themselves any shel|ter
at such a time: yet there is a possibility that
the Lord may be entreated to spare, and put up his
Sword, and prevent our ruine, which we have de|served;
but the day of Judgment is most certain;
God, who cannot change, hath decreed it: God,
who cannot lie, hath revealed it; the iniquities of
the World, which are great, do call for it; there|fore
it must be, the day will certainly come; and
yet can you sleep in sin? If a Thief knew after he
had robbed his neighbour, that he should certainly
be taken and judged, and condemned, and pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sh|ed,
it would affright him; you may know that
Christ will certainly come to judgment, and that
all guilty sinners shall be brought forth and con|demned,
and should not this awaken you, espe|cially
since if you sleep on, your damnation and
eternal punishment, will be certain?</P>
<P>3. <HI>Awake</HI> sinners, <HI>awake!</HI> Christ will <HI>quickly</HI>
appear to Judgment. The coming of the Lord
draweth nigh; the Judge standeth at the Door;
the Lord will suddenly come down; when you
least expect it, the Lord may be here; and can
you sleep, when the appearance of Christ is so sure,
and so neer too? can you slumber, when your
judgment lingreth not, and your damnation slum|breth
not? If the day of general Judgment should
be protracted for some time longer, until all the
Elect be gathered, and the things foretold in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ord, be fulfilled; yet your time for preparation
<PB N="238" REF="124">
may be almost spent, you may suddenly go down
into your Graves, where there is no operation;
and can you sleep in sin, when you are liable every
day to the stroke of death, which will cut you off
from all opportunities of making your peace with
God for ever, and deliver you up at the last day
into the hands of the Judge, under the same guilt
as it found you, when it first laid its arrest upon
you?</P>
<P>4. <HI>Awake</HI> sinners, <HI>awake!</HI> when Christ doth ap|pear,
<HI>yee also shall appear;</HI> when Christ is des|cended
from Heaven, yee shall be raised from the
Earth; you shall be awakened out of the sleep of
death, and will not you be awakened out of the
sleep of sin? If there were any hopes, that by
getting into your Graves before this day, you could
hide your selves, and lie buried there for ever,
you might be the more secure; but when your
death is not more certain, than your resurrection
will be, when the appearing of Christ to judgment
is not more certain, than your appearance on that
day to be judged, you have reason to shake off
sleep, and bethink your selves how you are pro|vided;
Death will be terrible to you, if it come
with the sting of sin in its mouth, if it shoot its
poisoned arrowes into you; but your resurrection
will be a thousand fold more dreadful, if you a|wake
at the last day with the guilt of sin in your
consciences; Sinners, think what terrours will in|vade
you, when you are raised out of your Graves;
when you first lift up your heads and eyes to Hea|ven,
and see the Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious
Judge of the World, come down with millions
of mighty Angels, cloathed with vengeance, like
flames of Fire, and look down with a furious coun|tenance
<PB N="239" REF="124">
upon you; when in your rising you hear
the sound of the Trumper, and such a shout gi|ven
in the aire, as will make a louder noise, than
if twenty thousand great pieces of Ordnance were
shot off together, just before you; when you have
a summons given you, and you are dragged with
the rest of the damned crew, which have lived in
all ages of the World, to the Tribunal Seat of
Jesus Christ; O how will you quiver, and tremble,
and be filled with confusion then? and yet can you
sleep securely now, as if you were not at all con|cerned?</P>
<P>5. <HI>Awake</HI> sinners, <HI>awake!</HI> when Christ doth ap|pear,
<HI>you shall be judged by him:</HI> Then the Books
will be opened, where all your actions are re|corded;
then your sins (now it may be forgotten
and slighted) will be called to remembrance, and
your secret sins, which now you are ashamed of,
will then be made manifest before the whole
World; your old sins will be reviewed; your old
uncleanness, your old drunkenness, your old un|righteousness;
and you will be made to hear of
all your sins, past and gone many years before, in
such a manner, as shall make your eares to tingle,
your hearts to quake, and tremble; and when
Gods justice shall arraign you, and the Devil ac|cuse
you, and your conscience shall bear witness a|gainst
you, and the Lord Jesus Christ shall pro|nounce
the Sentence upon you, <HI>Depart from me
yee cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil
and his Angels;</HI> and the Saints it may be accom|pany
him with a loud shout, <HI>Even so Amen,</HI> or
say with one voice, <HI>Go yee cursed into everl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sting
Fire,</HI> and so pass from you into Heaven, and leave
the Devil and his Angels to drag you unto tor|ments,
<PB N="240" REF="125">
and when you see there is no remedy, no
reversing of your condemnation, and the Devils
seize upon you, and tear you, and hale you away.
O how terrible will this Judgment be unto you?
O how will the terrours of the All-mighty flow in
upon you? how will your consciences gnaw, and
sting, and torment you? how will your spirits fail
and sink within you, and hearts melt like drops of
water? How will you weep, and wail, and gnash
your teeth? and cry out in the fearfulness and hor|rour
of your spirits, <HI>Woe, woe, woe be unto us that
ever we were born! Woe, woe, woe be unto us that ever
we have sinned!</HI></P>
<P>6. <HI>Awake</HI> sinners, <HI>awake! The execution of the
Sentence,</HI> which Christ will pronounce upon you
for your sins at the last day, <HI>will be in Hell:</HI> and
do you know what <HI>Hell is?</HI> what tongue can ex|press
the future torments, which the damned shall
endure? what heart can conceive the miseries,
which God hath prepared for sinners in Hell? yet
look into the Perspective-Glass of the Word, and
you may perceive something of the dreadfulness
of the punishment, which will be inflicted upon
you, if you be found in your sins at Christs second
appearance.</P>
<P>1. Sinners, consider the <HI>greatness</HI> of the punish|ment;
you must dwell with devouring Fire, and
inhabit most horrible burnings; and think with
your selves how you will be able to endure, to
have those bodies (unto whom the prick of a Pin
is so irksome, and a little scorch of a culinary
Fire is so painful) cast into the <HI>great Furnace of
Fire,</HI> which God will kindle with his breath;
which will turn them it may be, into a burning
Coal, that shall not waste, neither ever be co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|sumed;
<PB N="241" REF="125">
be sure will torment them with a thousand-fold
more accute sense of pain, than the body is
capable now of feeling, under the most exquisite
torments; think what the overwhelming grief,
what the horrible anxiety, what the despairful ago|nies,
what the hideous terrour and unexpressible
anguish of your souls will be under the immediate
sense of Gods wrath and indignation, and the
thoughts of that glory and happiness of Heaven
(once proffered unto you, but refused by you) which
you will then perceive your selves shut out from
for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Awake</HI> sinners, <HI>awake!</HI> will you sleep in sin un|til
you are awakened in the midst of flames? will
you not leave off sinning, until you have sinned
your selves into Hell? will you needs run into
these burnings? <HI>Awake!</HI> open your eyes a little
and look down, and see how deep the Pit is, into
which you are leaping, it is a bottomless Pit, from
whence there will be no returning; consider how
hot the Fire of Hell will be, unto which you are
hastning, it will be an inconceivable hot Fire,
of which there will be no avoiding, if you go on
in that broad way of sin, which is leading you
thereunto: <HI>Awake,</HI> and look up sinners, there is a
Door open, the Door of mercy is open, and the
Door of Heaven is open, and will you shut your
eyes, and turn your backs upon God, and refuse
the proffers of grace which are made to you? will
you trample Crowns under your feet, and slight
future glory and happiness, which now is possible
for you to obtain? will not this tear your hearts in
Hell, to remember that you have been the cause
of your own ruine, and brought misery upon your
<PB N="242" REF="126">
selves, that you suffered your selves to be cheated
by the Devil, and your own deceitful lusts, of the
unspeakable joyes and glory of Heaven, which
God did once make tenders of unto you?</P>
<P>2. Sinners, consider the <HI>sureness</HI> of the punish|ment
of Hell; it is most certain that God hath
prepared such a punishment, and it is certain that
you shall endure this punishment, if you abide un|der
the guilt, and persevere in the way of sin,
which you now are walking in; God hath threat|ned
this punishment, and his justice doth require it
and his truth doth engage him to execute his
threatned wrath, and inflict this deserved punish|ment
upon you; and can you then have the least
hopes to escape it? will God, can God prove a
lyar, to save you from the torments of Hell? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
it not equal that you should reap that which you
have sown, that you should gather and taste the
bitter fruits of your own evil wayes? if you sowe

<P><HI>Awake</HI> sinners, <HI>awake!</HI> are not all your hopes of
happiness in the uncertain and empty Cisterns of
the Creatures meet dreams, when such dreadfull
miseries are so surely prepared for you? and what
senseless dreames then are your hopes of Heaven
and Salvation, whilst you are going on in the way
of sin to Hell, and destruction? Is there any mer|cy
for impenitents? Is there any pardon for un|believers?
Doth God love those which are haters
of him? shall those live with him, who have no

which God hath never joyned. is like the sense|less

without holiness none shall see God; and as one
saith, <Q><HI>Sooner may Angels turn Devils, Men beasts,

after the Image of God, should be received into the

Glory.</HI></Q> Sinners, if there be no room for you in
Heaven, and your entrance there is impossible,
whilst you are in a state of nature; then your pu|nishment
in Hell is sure, which methinks should a|waken
you.</P>
<P>3. Sinners, consider the <HI>neerness</HI> of the punish|ment
of Hell: I mean the soul-punishment,
which will be the greatest part of the punishment;
the perfect and full punishment of body and soul
cannot be far off, because the time of Christs com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ng
is not far off; but the punishment of your

<P><HI>Awake</HI> sinners, <HI>awake!</HI> think how horrible the

your misery; methinks the danger of such torment

can you be secure, when you are in the greatest

the empty vanishing wordly honour, with the ex|ceeding

sinners begin to startle with such thunder-claps of
Judgment, and being unwilling to part with their
sins, feel their hearts to rise within them against
the message and Messengers, for thrusting such
harsh things into their eares, for molesting their
spirits, and disturbing the peace which they have
hitherto had in their sinful way: cannot Ministers

deceits; but what advantage would it be
unto you to be deceived? if you were pleased
with us, and did commend us here, I am sure you
would curse us for our unfaithfulness hereafter;
Sinners, it is not cruelty, but pitty and mercy to
shoot the sharp arrows of Gods threatnings into
your consciences; it is not out of hatred, but
tender love to your souls, that we endeavour to
thrust the sword of the spirit into your bosomes,
that if possible we might wound sin to the heart,
and fetch forth the blood thereof, as it were, which
if it still live in you, will be your ruine: Christ
will certainly and quickly be here, and when he
<PB N="247" REF="128">
doth appear, we shall appear to be judged, and
is it not good you should know it before hand, that
you might be prepared?</P>
<P>If any be so awakened by this Doctrine con|cerning
Christs coming to Judgment, that they be|gin
to feel a sting and wound in&punc; their spirits, and
are so perplexed with fear of being condemned
for their sins, which their consciences do accuse
them of, that they know not what to do, yet are
willing to take any course to prevent their ruine
and those dreadful miserics which they are in
danger of at that day. I shall speak unto such
by way of Counsel and Exhortation.</P>
<P>3. For the Exhortation of Sinners.</P>
<P>Will the Lord Jesus Christ certainly and quick|ly
appear to Judgment? there are two things
I would exhort sinners unto, that they may escape
the wrath of God, which on that day will be re|vealed
and inflicted upon all the wicked of the
Earth.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Flee from Sin.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Flee unto Christ,</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>If you would <HI>flee</HI> from <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>Hell.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Or, 1. <HI>Repent of Sin.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Get an interest in Christ.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And then you may be able to stand with confi|dence
before the Son of Man at his appearance,
yea, whatever your sins be now, do these two
things effectually, and when Christ doth appear
you also shall appear with him in glory.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Sinners repent of sin. Acts 17. 30, 31. God
commandeth all Men every where to repent,</HI> this is a
duty which God requires of all, <HI>Because he hath
<PB N="248" REF="129">
appointed a day, in the which he will judge the World
in righteousness, &amp;c.</HI> This is the Argument to en|force
the duty. It is your duty to repent, because
you have sinned, and God commandeth you to do
it; and it is your interest and concernment to re|pent,
because God will judge the World by Jesus
Christ for sin, and condemn you if you be found
impenitent. Sinners, you have tasted the sweet|ness
of sin, in the Commission of it, O labour to
taste the bitterness of sin in your repentance for
it; your sins have been displeasing to the holy and
jealous God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">et them be displeasing to your souls;
your sins have wounded the Lord Jesus Christ, let
them pierce your hearts; the spirit of God hath
been grieved and quenched by them, be you grie|ved
and troubled for them; grieve for sin, not
only because of its consequential evil, but also
because of its incrinsecal evil; not only because
it is like to damn you, but also because it hath so
much defiled you; not only because it is likely to
sink you into Hell amongst Devils, but also be|cause
it hath debased you, and made you more
vile than the Beasts that perish.</P>
<P>Sinners mourn for sin: Be afflicted, mourn and
weep: <HI>Let your laughter be turned into mourning,
and your joy into heavinesse,</HI> Jam. 4. 9. Get your
proud hearts humbled, and your hard hearts bro|ken
for those sins whereby you have broken Gods
Law; get your hearts broken for sin, and get your
hearts broken from sin; Break off your sins by Re|pentance;
<HI>Cast away</HI> all your transgressions <HI>like
menstru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us cloathes, saying, get ye hence,</HI> Isa. 30. 22.
<HI>Let the wicked forsake his way, &amp; the unrighteous man
his thoughts, &amp; turn to the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Isa. 55. 7.</HI> Thrust
these Iuhabitants out of doors who have so long
<PB N="249" REF="129">
had possession; suffer not to lodge any longer
within you; remember that they are Vipers which
will poyson you, that they are enemies which will
wound and kill you: Do not harbour sin any lon|ger,
do not entertain it with smiles and a pleasing
countenance, but with teares and frownes: Get
your hearts set against sin; labour for deep-rooted
hatred of it, and accordingly behave your selves to|wards
it; get the strong holds of sin demolished
in your hearts; get the rooms in which your lusts
have scattered defilement, washed with the teares
of Repentance, and the blood of Jesus Christ: let
Christ have his Throne where sin hath reigned;
let your thoughts and affections be brought into
captivity and obedience unto Jesus Christ: Keep
the door of your hearts with all diligence, least
your old enemy enter again upon you: Flee from
sin as from a Cockatrice, and if you be pursued,
man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ully resist, resist even unto blood, striving a|gainst
sin; never parley with sin, hearken not to
any tearms of composition; Be not enticed unto
sin by pleasing baits, neither be affrighted to sin
by frowns and threatnings: Fight the good fight of
Faith; Turn by repentance from sin, break off
the course of sin, and walk not in the way thereof,
and turn by repentance unto the Lord; let the Bi|ass
of your hearts be turned unto him; Deliver
up your selves unto the obedience of his Law, yield
your selves unto God, &amp;c. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. This is Re|pentance.
And that you may repent of Sin:</P>
<P>1. <HI>Examine your selves:</HI> Christ will exa|mine
you at the last day, and you must give an
account unto him; examine your selves and call
your selves to an account, that you may repent
and prevent the future misery which will be the
<PB N="250" REF="130">
consequent of sin; Finde out your sins that you
may mourn and turn; that which the eye seeth not,
the heart will not, cannot be affected withal;
Consult the Register of your consciences, turn o|ver
the leaves and read what is recorded in that
Book: open your hearts to the beams of the light
of the Word, and be ready to receive the convi|ctions
of the Spirit; Find out your sins, your origi|nal
sin, the defilement of your natures, your actual
sins, your great Conscience-wounding sins; find
out your bosome-sins, which your hearts are most
nearly joined unto, and are most loth to part
withal; finde out your Constitution-sins, your
Calling-sins, the sins which bear the greatest sway,
and are most supported by the interest of the flesh,
and your hearts are ready to cloak and cover un|der
the veil of excuses and plausible pleas: Think
how you will be able to answer for them at the
great Day, to the Heart-searching Judge.</P>
<P>Sinners, finde out your sins, otherwise your sins
will finde you out, and Christ will finde you out,
and Wrath will finde you out, and then woe be
unto you.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Iudge and condemn your selves for your sins:</HI>
this is the way to escape the judgement of God,
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 31. If you judge others, you shall be
judged, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. 1. but if you judge your selves
you shall escape; and therefore</P>
<P>3. <HI>Make confession of sin;</HI> Spread the black Ca|talogue
of your sins before the Lord; come with
ropes about your necks, and tears in your eyes,
and sorrow in your hearts unto the Throne of
Grace, and fill your mouthes with humble ac|knowledgements
of your sins: rip up your hearts
before the Lord: open before him your soars: stand
<PB N="251" REF="130">
no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> in your own defence and justification, but fall
down prostrate at God's feet, and confess what sin|full
natures you have, what vile hearts, what wic|ked
lives you have lead; confesse how you have
broken his Law, and disobeyed his Gospel;
charge upon your selves the guilt of your particu|lar
and most heinous sins, and do not extenuate
but aggravate them with all the circumstances you
can think of; look upon your selves as cursed
wretches whilest under the guilt of sin, as miser|able,
lost, forlorne creatures, whilest God is your
enemy and his wrath abideth on you; acknow|ledge
your sins and the demerit of your sins, that
you have deserved not only temporal plagues, but
also eternal torments; that you have forfeited all
outward mercies, and are unworthy of the least
grace and favour, much more unworthy of eternal
life. Lye very low before God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ick the dust;
look upon your selves as Wormes, as Toads, yea
as more vile and more full of poyson.</P>
<P>4. If under the view of sin and confession
thereof, you finde your hearts hard and senslesse
like rocks, or Adamantine stones within your
hearts, yet be not discouraged; the sense of hard|nesse
is some beginning of softnesse; but do not
rest in beginnings: <HI>take pains with them to get them
melted throughly,</HI> to get them broken to pieces:
Read and consider, and apply, and urge at the
Throne of Grace the gracious Promise, <HI>Ezek. 36.
26. I will take away the stony heart out of your
flesh, and give you a heart of flesh.</HI> Be sensible of
your own inability of your selves to repent of sin,
and perswaded th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> it is Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s grace; remember it
is free, but withal that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> promised; beg the in|fluence
of his Spirit upon your hearts to mel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

them; beg the application of the blood of Christ
to mollifie them: the blood of the Goat only can
break an Adama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t stone, and it is the blood of
Christ the Scape-goat which alone can break the
hard hearts of sinners.</P>
<P>If any be discouraged with the difficulty of Re|pentance,
that it is hard to obtain, and a very
grievous thing to endure; Let them</P>
<P>1. Consider; That Repentance is <HI>necessary:</HI>
it is necessary <HI>Virtue praecepti,</HI> by vertue of Gods
Precept; it is a necessary Duty; <HI>Acts. 17. 30. God
commandeth</HI> not only some men, but <HI>all men:</HI> not
only in some place, but <HI>every where to repent:</HI> and
it is necessary <HI>virtute medij,</HI> as it is a means to a|void
misery and obtain happinesse; you must sow
in tears, if you would reap in joy; and you must
go forth weeping bearing precious seed, if you
would return again rejoycing bringing your sheavs
with you, <HI>Psalm</HI> 126. 5. 6. The showers of tears
make way for the Sun-shine of comfort here: and
the wet seed-time of Repentance, is neces|sary
to the harvest of everlasting glory and
joy; and if Repentance be difficult: yet since
it is absolutely necessarie, this should be so far
from discouraging you, that it should quicken you
unto more diligent endeavours after it.</P>
<P>2. Consider, that Repentance is <HI>attainable;</HI>
the vilest sinners may be enabled through Gods
Grace to repent, as well as the most holie Saints
at their first turning unto God. It is difficult un|to
you, yea impossible for you to repent of your
selves, because there are no seeds of this Grace in
Nature, but it is easie with God to work you to
it, and he can carrie you thorow the difficultie;
pray to God for this grace, &amp; endeavour to repent
<PB N="253" REF="131">
and in your endeavours God may assist; God is
easie to be entreated, and is readie to give this
Grace unto them that desire it.</P>
<P>But some are discouraged from <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 17.
where it is said, that <HI>Esau was rejected, and found
no place for repentance, though he sought it carefully
with tears:</HI> hence concluding, that though they
seek repentance carefully with tears, they may be
rejected, and finde no place for repentance.</P>
<P>I answer, 1. That this place which speaks of
<HI>Esau's</HI> rejection, hath not a reference to his reje|ction
by God (though that may be included in it)
but his rejection by his Father <HI>Isaac,</HI> in reference
to the Blessing, which his younger brother <HI>Iacob</HI>
had by a wile got before him. 2. That <HI>Esau</HI> there
did not seek to God for repentance, but he sought
to his Father for his blessing. 3. That he did not
seek repentance for himself, but he sought with
tears to his Father, that he would repent his giving
the blessing to <HI>Iacob,</HI> and give it unto him. Such
as with tears seek repentance of God, it is a signe
they have some measure of this Grace.</P>
<P>3. Consider, the <HI>worth and excellency</HI> of this
Grace; though it be difficult, yet it is excellent,
<HI>Pulchra sunt difficilia,</HI> the best things are not ob|tained
without difficultie; had you this grace, you
would not be without it for a world, you would
not change your tears and sorrow for sin, for all the
sweetnesse and pleasure that others finde in the
commission of it; if you did but truly repent, you
would not think it so grievous a thing to be bourn,
but the more you had of it, the more you would
desire, and be best pleased, when you could act this
grace most stronglie.</P>
<P>4. Consider, that the <HI>greatest dissiculty is at first:</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="132">
Flesh may contradict and violently oppose the be|ginnings
of Repentance, which doth so manifest|ly
seek its ruine and destruction; but after you
are accustomed to the yoke, you will finde it more
easie; after you have got mastery over your flesh,
and have attained some degrees of mortificati|on,
you will finde it suitable to the new man to
live in the exercise of Repentance, and reap much
sweetnesse from it.</P>
<P>5. Consider, That <HI>you must repent and mourn
for sin here, or you will be damned and burn for sin
for ever;</HI> You cannot avoid grief for sin, if you
have it not in this world, you will be sure to have
it in the other world; And is it not a thousand-fold
more eligible to grieve for sin here? especially
considering,</P>
<P>1. If you repent of sin now, <HI>your grief will not
be in extremity:</HI> it will have some allay, some al|leviation,
some mixture of secret comfort, at least
something will be given in to support, when you
are even ready to be overwhelmed: when the heart
is most broken and contrite under the sense of sin
and apprehensions of Gods wrath, yet God will
not suffer the Spirit to fail before him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57. 15,
16. the Lord will keep up the soul from quite
sinking: and I am confident, that such persons as are
most heavie laden with grief for sin, would not
change their condition when at the lowest ebb,
with the most prosperous worldling: But if you
repent not till hereafter, your grief will be ex|tream,
without the least mixture of comfort or
support. In hell you will have nothing but weep|ing,
and wailing, and gnashing of teeth; you will
be there utterly consumed with terrours, quite o|verwhelmed
with sorrows, &amp; be alwaies sinking in
<PB N="255" REF="132">
the bottomlesse-pit under the weight of grief,
which will be un-supportable.</P>
<P>2. Your repentance of sin now will be <HI>plea|sing
unto God:</HI> We read, <HI>Luke</HI> 15. how well plea|sed
the Father was when his Prodigal son returned
home, and with grief did acknowledge that
he had sinned against Heaven and against him;
and was not worthy to be called his Son; the Fa|ther
meets him in the way, and kisseth him, and
cloatheth him with the best Robe, and kills the
fatted Calf for him, and maketh merry with him;
so, though you have been prodigals hitherto, have
gone astray from God, and wasted your time, and
talents in the service of the Devil, and your own
lusts; yet if at length you come to your selves,
&amp; with repentance, and humble confession of your
sins, you return unto the Lord, he will pitty you, his
bowels will yern towards you whilst you are yet
upon the way; and he will meet you, and embrace
you, and cloath you with the Robes of his sons righ|teousnesse,
and be pleased with you, and rejoyce o|ver
you; yea, and the Angels also will rejoice in
your conversion; there will be joy in Heaven at
your repentance amongst the Angels, and joy on
earth amongst the Saints, Ministers will be pleased
and rejoice; they will pittie you and pray for you;
and Saints will be pleased and be ready to help
and advise you; but Gods pittie is beyond all.
See how God is taken with repenting <HI>Ephraim,
Ier. 31. 18, 19, 20. I have surely heard</HI> Ephraim
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">emoaning himself,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Surely after I was turned, I
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">epented; and after I was instructed I smote upon my
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">high, I was ashamed, yea even confounded, because I
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">id bear the reproach of my youth;</HI> there you have
the description of <HI>Ephraim' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> repentance; and O
<PB N="256" REF="133">
the sweet words of most tender Love which the
Lord doth express himself in, towards <HI>Ephraim</HI>
under his repentings! <HI>Is</HI> Ephraim <HI>my dear son?
is he my pleasant childe? for since I spake against him,
I do earnestly remember him still? therefore my
bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mer|cy
on him, saith the Lord.</HI> But if you repent not
till hereafter, your grief will not only be extream,
but also you will have no eye to pittie you; God
will not pittie you in the least, but laugh at your
calamitie, his bowels will be shut against you;
your grief then will not be pleasing in the least,
and your cries and complaints of sin then will be
like the howling of a Dog in his eares: He will
then instead of meeting you to embrace you, he
will meet you to destroy you; instead of speaking
kindly to you, he will speak to you in his wrath,
and vexe you in his hot displeasure; Angels and
Saints will then turn from you, and Devils will
drag you with them into torments.</P>
<P>3. If you repent of sin now, <HI>you may obtain th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
pardon of sin; I will surely have mercy on him,</HI> saith
the Lord, concerning repenting <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer. 31&punc;
20. <HI>He that confesseth his sins,</HI> that is, with repen|tance,
so as not only to grieve for them, but also
to leave and <HI>for sake them, shall finde mercy,</HI> Prov.
28. 13. Yea; God hath promised <HI>abundantly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
pardon such as forsake their evil wayes,</HI> and by repen|tance
<HI>turn to him,</HI> Isa. 55. 7. and if sinners <HI>ceas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
to do evil, and learn to do well,</HI> that <HI>though their sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
be as scarlet, they shall be white as snox, though they
be red like Crimson, they shall be as wool,</HI> Isa. 1. 16&punc;
17, 18. And not only his mercy, but also his ju|stice
and faithfulnesse is engaged to pardon such
as acknowledge their sins with repentance, and
<PB N="257" REF="133">
apply themselves to him by faith: 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1. 9.
<HI>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteous|ness.</HI>
The Door of mercy is now open to all true
penitents, and the golden Scepter of Grace and
Reconciliation is hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> forth unto them; the Lord
Jesus Christ is now interceding at the right hand
of God, ready to make their peace with God;
but if you do not repent until hereafter, a pardon
will be unattainable; there will remain no sacri|fice
for sin; then the day of grace will be quite
spent; and the Door of mercy will be fast shut: then
Jesus Christ will have finished his interceding
work, and it will be impossible to obtain re|mission.</P>
<P>4. If you repent of sin now, <HI>you may get strength
against sin;</HI> you shall be delivered from the reign|ing
power of sin presently, and you shall be freed
from the rage and tyranny of sin by degrees, and
at the last you shall obtain a perfect freedome
from the being of sin, and be wholly delivered
from the bondage of corruption. But if you do
not repent until hereafter, you will for ever abide
under the power of sin, you will not only be
tormented in Hell, but also be for ever sinning
in Hell.</P>
<P>5. If you repent of sin now, <HI>you will escape the
panishment of sin:</HI> I do not speak of some tempo|ral
calamities, which God may exercise his people
withall in this World; but you shall assuredly be
kept from the eternal punishment of Hell, which
shall be inflicted upon the ungodly World; but if
you do not repent of sin until hereafter, your pu|nishment
will be unavoidable, no cries nor teares
will then save you from the torments of Hell,
<PB N="258" REF="134">
which you will be condemned unto; now you are
condemned for sin, whilst unbelievers, but in this
World the sentence is reversible, you may
fly from the Bar of justice, to the Throne of
Grace, and if with repentance and faith you
apply your selves unto Jesus Christ, he will deliver
you from the wrath to come, and free you from
condemnation; but hereafter, when the Lord Je|sus
Christ shall appear unto Judgment, and sum|mon
you, and examine you, and finde you guilty,
and pass sentence upon you, to depart into ever|lasting
Fire; this sentence will be irreversible, and
your repentance will be too late to procure free|dome
from, or the least mitigation of your pu|nishment.</P>
<P>6. If you repent of sin now, <HI>your grief will be
but for a time;</HI> for a season, a short time, a few
dayes, a night, a moment, a short moment, 1 <HI>Pet,
1. 6. Rev. 2. 10. Psal. 30. 5. Isa. 54. 6, 7. Weep|ing
may endure for a night, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ut joy cometh in the
morning;</HI> God will not permit you to weep and
grieve for sin long; it is not a life of grief which
he calleth you unto, but a life of faith and love;
it is not grief for it self which he requireth, but in
order unto your comfort, and therefore it shall not
be of long continuance; your grief for sin doth
make way for spiritual comforts, for the joyes of
the holy Ghost, which after sorrowing times the
Lord doth often give in abundantly unto his Chil|dren
in this World; in which they finde incom|parably
more sweetness, than ever they could
finde sweetness in sin, or bitterness in sorrow; they
have pleasures of a higher and more transcenden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
nature; be sure your grief for sin will make way
for your everlasting joyes in Heaven, where all
<PB N="259" REF="134">
teares shall be wiped away from your eyes, and all
sorrow and sighing shall be removed from your
hearts, and you shall obtain gladnesse unspeak|able
and everlasting. But if you do not repent
until hereafter, as the pleasures which you finde
in sin, will be but for a season, and your tryum|phing
but short, Death be sure will put a conclu|sion
unto all: so your grief for sin then will be
long, the daies of darknesse and sorrow will be
many, yea your grief will be eternal.</P>
<P><HI>Repent</HI> then sinners, <HI>repent;</HI> Christ will come
<HI>certainly</HI> to judgment, therefore repent <HI>truly;</HI> and
Christ will come <HI>quickly</HI> to judgment, therefore
repent <HI>speedily.</HI> Protract not the time, endeavour
presently without any further delay. Consider|ing.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Your particular judgment may be suddenly,</HI>
and the time of your preparation may be spent
quickly; You may be within a few moneths or
weeks, or daies, yea, it may be within a few
houres smitten by Deaths arrows, and there will
be no place for repentance and preparation in the
other world.</P>
<P>2. If you defer your repentance, <HI>it is a thou|sand
to one that you never repent as long as you live,</HI>
If your life should continue many yeares; be|cause
not one in a thousand that defer their re|pentance,
do afterwards repent; there are millions
in hell that lived under the light of the Gospel who
intended to repent, but were prevented by death
before they were aware; and it is a thousand to
one if you defer any longer, but ere long you will
be received into their number; have not you de|ferred
your repentance before this till such a time
and such a time? and yet when such times have
<PB N="260" REF="135">
come again and again, have you not deferred it
still? and will not your deceitful hearts still finde
as plausible excuses till it be too late? Remem|ber
this sinners, that it is a thousand to one but you
will be damned, if you any longer defer your re|pentance.</P>
<P>3. The longer you defer your repentance, the
<HI>more difficult will you finde the work to be,</HI> because
you will be the faster bound in Sathans chains, and
not so easily loosned; because you will be the fa|ster
asleep in sin, and not so easily awakened; be|cause
your hearts will grow the harder by the
Jong practice of sin, and not so easily broken;
because your sins will be the more encreased
which you must repent of; because your time
will be the more decreased which you are to
repent in; so that if it should come to passe
(which is a thousand to one) that you should re|pent
after procrstination or deferring repen|tance;
yet you will finde the work to be very
difficult.</P>
<P>4. Think <HI>what glory you may bring to God,</HI> what
service you may do if you repent and reform pre|sently;
all which time, whilest you defer repen|tance,
is spent in the service of the Devil and your
own lusts, unto the dishonour of God.</P>
<P>5. Think what measures of <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>comfort</HI>
you may attain here, and what degrees of <HI>glory</HI>
you may attain hereafter, if you repent without
delay, which by deferring the work, you are like
to lose.</P>
<P>6. If you defer Repentance, <HI>it is a question
whether your last repentance will be true;</HI> and if it
should be true, it is a question whether ever you
<PB N="261" REF="135">
shall obtain the evidence of the truth there|of.</P>
<P>7. And lastly, If you defer your repentance,
<HI>God may never call you to repentance;</HI> Yea, he may
give you up to a judiciary hardnesse, and seal you
up unto condemnation, swearing in his wrath that
you shall never enter into his Rest.</P>
<P>Thus much for the exhortation of Sinners to
repent.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Sinners, will the Lord Iesus Christ cer|tainly
and quickly appear to judgment, be perswaded
then to flee to him, and get an interest in him before
his appearance.</HI> I am sure that there is none of
you, but would be glad of an interest in Christ
when he cometh in his glorie to judge the world;
the vilest persons upon the earth, those who de|spise
and reject Christ now, those who hate and
scorn the wayes of godlinesse, as being too mean a
way for their high spirits, would give ten thousand
worlds if they had them, for the room of the
meanest Believers who have an interest in Christ
at that day; But let me tell you sinners, that this
world is the onely place, and this time while the
day of Grace doth last, is the onely time of ob|taining
such a priviledge as this is; if you have
not an interest in Christ whilst you live, it will be
impossible to obtain it after death, or at the resur|rection;
If you are none of Christs now, he will
not know you, nor own you at the day of his glori|ous
Appearance.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Get an interest in Christ as your high Priest
and Advocate;</HI> Be sensible of your sins: be assu|red
of his death for sin and satisfaction to Gods
<PB N="262" REF="136">
justice; Be perswaded of his intercession at the
right hand of God, and that he is able and willing
to save you; apply your selves to him, that through
him you may obtain remission of sins, and an in|heritance
amongst the Saints; and if through the
mediation of Christ now, you obtain a pardon of
all your sins here: how welcome will your Re|deemer
be unto you, and with what joy will you
lift up your heads out of your graves when the day
of your Redemption and perfect Salvation is
come, and your Saviour doth appear to take ven|geance
upon unpardoned sinners, but shall own
and acquit you before the whole world.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Get Christ to be your Master;</HI> Enter your
selves amongst his Servants and Disciples: sub|mit
to his Teachings: learn his Lessons; believe
and obey his Commands: follow his Example;
promote his honour and interest in the world; be
readie to do, or suffer any thing for him; and when
your Lord and Master cometh in his glorie, you
will finde that it was not in vain to serve him,
though in wayes harsh and grating to flesh and
blood. O what a Reward will be give then to his
Servants! What a crown of glorie will he put
upon their heads! It is a sweet encouraging Pro|mise
which Christ hath made now, and will make
good to all his faithfull servants at that day, <HI>Iohn
12. 26. If any man serve me, let him follow me, and
where I am, there shall my servant be; if any man
serve me, him will my Father honour.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Get Christ to be your Husband.</HI> Sinners, We
Ministers are sent to invite and wooe you to enter
into this most near and sweet Relation unto Jesus
Christ; we are to tell you of the beautie and ex|cellencie
of his Person, of his Love and ten|der
<PB N="263" REF="136">
affection to poor sinners, of his willingness to
be yours, and to make you sharers in his riches;
O accept of him, it is the best motion that ever
was made to you, and it may be the laft motion:
accept of Christ to be your husband, lay off your
filthy Garments; put on the white Robes of his
righteousness; joyn your hearts to him; divorse
your selves from sin, and dedicate your selves unto
Christ alone; and if Christ be your husband, O
how joyful will his appearance be unto you, when
you shall see his glorious face, and sweet smiles,
and be received into his embracements, and be
carried by him into his Fathers house, where you
shall live with, and delight in his loves for ever|more.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Get Christ to be your Captain;</HI> list your selves
under his banner; wear his Colours; arme your
selves with his Weapons; follow his conduct; fight
against his Enemies; endure hardness as good
Souldiers, and do not shrink when you are put
upon the tryal: and if you have an interest in this
Captain, and be victorious here over your spiritual
enemies; when your Captain doth ride in Tri|umph
at the last day, you shall be caught up into
the Clouds, and Triumph with him, and receive
a Crown of Glory from him which fadeth not
away.</P>
<P>Sinners, get an interest in Christ in all his Offi|ces,
in all his Relations; it is he only can save
you from sin, and wrath, and eternal death. It
would be too large a subject here to treat of sal|vation
by Christ, and the way of attaining it;
I may (God giving leave) hereafter treat purpose|ly
on some <HI>words whereby we may be saved,</HI> from
<HI>Acts 11. 14. He shall tell thee words, whereby thou
<PB N="264" REF="137">
and thy House shall be saved,</HI> which I thought to
have added to the end of this, with some <HI>words of
advice unto young Men,</HI> from 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2. part of the
14. vers. <HI>I have written unto you young Men, because
yee are strong, and the Word of god abideth in you,
and yee have overcome the wicked one.</HI> All which I
did indeed at the first inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a to have joyned to|gether
in one small Volume, with <HI>God's terrible

to separate them into three parts, which I
thought at first the room of one would hold.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>HAving spoken to Sinners, I come now to
speak,</P>
<P>2. To <HI>Believers,</HI> and that in two words.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. For the Tryal of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. For the comforting of them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. <HI>For the tryal of Believers;</HI> the Doctrine of
Christs certain and sudden appearance to Judge|ment,
is a most dreadful Doctrine to sinners, which
are <HI>in sin;</HI> and it is a most comfortable Doctrine
to believers, which are <HI>in Christ:</HI> but because ma|ny
sinners, which are stil held fast in the bond of
iniquity, and are under the reigning power of
some sins, are apt to mistake, and without good
ground do perswade themselves that they are be|lievers,
who at the last day will be found to be hy|pocrites;
and through their mistake of their state,
do ward off those strokes of Gods threatnings
which are made at them, and save themselves
hereby from those terrible apprehensions of Christs
<PB N="265" REF="137">
appearance to Judge and condemn them, which
did they entertain, might be a meanes to startle
them, and awaken them to take an effectual and
speedy course for the salvation of themselves from
future vengeance; and because many true be|lievers,
who are really united unto Christ by faith,
are apt also through the temptation of Sathan, and
their own ignorance, and doubting misgiving-heart,
to mistake themselves, and look upon themselves
to be hypocrites, and therefore fear that when
Christ doth appear, that they shall be condemned
by him, being so ready to condemn themselves,
and therefore gather matter for trouble from this
Doctrine, which indeed is matter of the greatest
comfort; therefore it will be needful for the un|deceiving
of the former, that they may not falfly
apply comfort, and the rectifying the mistakes of
the latter, that they may not put off comfort, to
make some tryal of true believers: It would be
too large to present to you all the character which
we may finde in the Word of God of true be|lievers:
therefore I shall make mention but of
one, which the Text holds forth, and is the second
Doctrine observed from the Words, in the begin|ing
of our Discourse.</P>
<P>Doct. 2. That there is an earnest desire in the
Church, <HI>or true Believers,</HI> after the second appea|rance
of the Lord Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>You may try your selves whether you are true
believers by your desires after Christs appearance;
this is the Character which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> giveth
of Believers, that they are such as love, and by
consequence desire the appearance of the Lord Je|sus
Christ: 2 <HI>Tim. 4. 8. Henceforth there is laid up
for me a Crown of right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">sness, which the Lord, the
<PB N="266" REF="138">
righteous Iudge shall give me at that day; and not to
me only, but also to all them that love his appearance:</HI>
All such, and none but such shall have a Crown of
righteousness, who love Christs appearing; be|lievers
are said to look for Christs coming, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.
28. <HI>Vnto them that look for him shall he appear the
second time, without sin unto salvation.</HI> He will ap|pear
unto all, but only to them that look for him,
will he appear unto salvation. Believers look
for Christs appearance, with an <HI>eye of faith, of hope,</HI>
and <HI>of desire.</HI></P>
<P>1. Believers look for Christs appearance with
<HI>an eye of faith;</HI> they expect it as sure as death, yea
as more sure, because the death of some will be
prevented by it; it is not impossible that the Lord
Jesus should come in our days: they surely believe
that the Lord will come.</P>
<P>2. Believers look for the appearance of Christ
with <HI>an eye of hope; Tit. 2. 13. Looking for that
blessed hope, and the glorious appearance of the great
God, and our Saviour.</HI> As they have hopes of the
glory of Heaven, so they have hopes of the com|ing
of Christ, who will receive them into glory,
who will put the Crown upon their Heads, and
bring them with Triumph unto the new <HI>Ieru|salem.</HI></P>
<P>3. Believers look for the appearance of Christ
with <HI>an eye of love and desire;</HI> they love and long
for his appearance, they look with many a glance
of love towards the Pallace above, where their
Lord is, and they have many a longing wish, that
he would come forth, and come down, and receive
them unto himself, that where he is, there they
might be also. The Bride saith <HI>come,</HI> and the de|sire
of the Spouse is, <HI>Make haste my belived, and be as
<PB N="267" REF="138">
Roe upon the Mountains of Spices: Cant.</HI> 8. 14.
Believers pray, Thy <HI>Kingdome come,</HI> in the Lord's
Prayer, which he taught his Disciples, they desire
the coming, not only of the Kingdome of grace,
but also of the Kingdome of glory; and in the
Text, the Church breathes forth this desire, after
Christs appearance, <HI>Amen, even so come Lord
Iesus.</HI></P>
<P>Now examine your selves whether you are true
believers by this Character. Do you love and de|sire
Christs appearance?</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> If any object against themselves, and say,
alas! we fear then we are no true believers, be|cause
we cannot say that we love and desire
Christs appearance, we are so far from desiring
it, that we are afraid of it, and it is matter of the
greatest trouble unto us to think of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. See you to that, many go under the
name of believers, which have only the name;
take heed that none of you be found in the num|ber
of such, at the last day.</P>
<P>2. Possibly some of you may condemn your
selves without reason, as Gods Children are more
forward to do than hypocrites, who have the most
reason; It may be you do not desire that Christ
should come immediatly, but do not you desire
that Christ should come at all? a Wife may sin|cerely
and greatly desire the coming home of her
Husband, when he is gone a long journey; and
yet if her House be out of order, and not fitted
to her minde for the receiving of him, if she be
not dressed and got into such a garb, as she knows
would be pleasing to him; she may be content
that he would stay a little longer, until she be
better prepared, yea she may be afraid of his com|ing
<PB N="268" REF="139">
whilst she is unprepared; the Harlot or Adul|teress
could be content that her Husband should
never return, but the true wife doth desire the com|ing
of her husband, though sometimes not the pre|sent
coming: so true believers they do desire Christs
coming, who is gone a long journey to Heaven,
though they may not desire his present coming, be|cause
they are not so fitted as they desire to be|for
the receiving of him; they desire his coming,
they would not for all the World that he should
stay away for ever in Heaven; unbelievers could
be content Christ should stay away for ever, and
that they might live for ever upon Earth, but be|lievers
could not be so content, they may fer
Christs immediate coming, because of their unpre|paration,
but they desire his coming.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> How should we know whether our de|sires
after Christs coming be sincere?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. If you love Christs person, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
sign your desires after his coming are sincere; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
desire the coming of friends to us, whom we love&punc;
Do you love Christ in sincerity? Do you love
him for himself, for his own excellencies, his love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">liness,
his love, and spiritual love-tokens? do you
love him upon a spiritual account?</P>
<P>2. If you do sincerely desire the comming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
Christ into your hearts in regard of his Spirit and
grace, it is a sign you have sincere desires after
his coming in glorie; when grace will arrive to it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
perfection; Can you understandingly and heartily
pray <HI>Thy Kingdome come;</HI> I mean, that Christ's
Kingdome of grace should be erected in your
hearts; and are sincerely desirous to have all things
within you brought into subjection and obedience
thereunto? Do you sincerely and earnestly desire
<PB N="269" REF="139">
the presence of Christ and the breathings of his
Spirit upon your hearts in his Ordinances? it is a
sign that there are at least true radical desires in
you after his second appearance, though by reason
of doubts and feares they may not be so ex|presse.</P>
<P>3. If you have laid up your treasure in Hea|ven,
and placed your happinesse in things above:
if you have cast the Anchor of your hope upward
into that which is within the Vail, it is a sign you
have true desires after Christ's appearance, that he
might give you possession of the happinesse which
you have made choice of.</P>
<P>4. If you are careful to please the Lord, and
whether present or absent, to be accepted of him;
and are affraid of sin, because it is grievous to him;
and are diligent in the use of means to fit and pre|pare
your selves, and make all things readie for
the receiving of him, it is a sign you do both look
for his coming, and do desire it.</P>
<P>5. And lastly, if you have lively hopes of his com|ing,
and can rejoice in those hopes, if you can with
earnestness pray, <HI>Come Lord Iesus, come quickly;</HI> this
is a sign indeed of your desires, though all true Be|liever
have not attained to so great a heighth.</P>
<P>Unbelievers, they do not desire Christ's appea|rance,
because they do not believe in him, be|cause
they do not love him, because their hearts
are set upon the world, because they are under
the guilt and power of sin, and because when Christ
doth appear, he will judge them, condemn them,
and punish them; But though they do not desire
Christ's coming, nor think of it, nor prepare for it,
yet Christ will come, and his coming will be dread|ful
unto them.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="140">
Believers, they desire Christ's coming, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>2. <HI>Rejoice,</HI> Believers <HI>rejoice!</HI> Christ will <HI>cer|tainly</HI>

the truth of this thing, you would have reason to
grieve; but when the thing is so certain, when
God hath revealed it in his Word so clearlie, when
the Lord hath promised it to his people so faith|fully,
and given his People hopes and expectati|ons
of it, he will not disappoint them: You have
reason to rejoice, there is nothing more certain, as
hath been proved, than the second appearance of
the Lord Jesus Christ at the last day,</P>
<P>3. <HI>Rejoice</HI> Believer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s, <HI>rejoice!</HI> Christ will <HI>quick|ly</HI>
appear; the coming of the Lord draweth nigh;
there is a time set, though you cannot know it, be|cause
God hath locked up this secret in his own
bosome; yet you may know that it cannot now
be far off; the Lord will not tarrie much longer
in Heaven before he come down to Judgment:
<HI>Look up then, and lift up your heads with joy, for the
day of your Redemption draweth nigh, Luke</HI> 21. 28.
You will not long groan under the bondage and
burden of corruption; You will not long mourn
and complain under the persecutions of cruel E|nemies;
You will not long be assaulted and buf|ferred
with the temptations of Sathan; You will
not long live in the dark Prison of the world, Christ
will quickly be here and open the Prison-doors,

Mother, Wife, Children, Houses, Lands, yea and
have laid down your lives for the testimony of Je|sus,
and that you might keep a good conscience,
think what entertainment the Lord Jesus will give
to you at that time? and O how will you rejoyce
that the Lord should confer so great honour and
dignity upon you, as to call you forth and enable
you to suffer for his name? and think how sweetly
the sentence which Christ shall pronounce upon
you, will sound in your eares! <HI>Come yee blessed of
my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you from
the foundation of the World.</HI></P>
<P>6. <HI>Rejoyce</HI> Believers <HI>rejoyce!</HI> when Christ doth

appear, <HI>he will reward you,</HI> he will give you a crown
of glory, which fadeth not away; he will not on|ly

he will give you possession thereof, he will

you, and bring you into the new <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> he
will show you the Father unto your full satisfacti|on,
and you shall behold his glory and share in it,
he will put you into those mansions which he hath
prepared for you; Then, and never till then shall
you be perfectly happy, and the fore-thoughts of
this is matter of exceeding great comfort, especi|ally
if you consider these four properties of Hea|vens
happiness.</P>
<P>1. Believers consider the <HI>greatness</HI> of the hap|piness
of Heaven, it will be full, and you will be
filled therewith unto your utmost capacity, yea
beyond what here you are capable of; consider
these particulars in your happiness of Hea|ven.</P>
<P>1. Think what <HI>bodies</HI> you will have; they will
be most beautiful and glorious bodies, they will
be most healthful, strong and immortal bodies;
you will then bear the image of the Heavenly
<HI>Adam,</HI> in regard of your bodies, as well as in
regard of your souls.</P>
<P>Rejoyce then believers rejoyce! what though
some of you have crooked and deformed bodies
now? what though some of you are blinde or
lame, or maimed, or have your bodies filled with
irksome pains, and weakned with long sickness?
what though you live in expectation of death, and
these bodies, whatever their mold and shape be,
must ere long be carried to the cold stinking grave,
<PB N="275" REF="142">
and be turned into putrefaction? yet rejoice you
that are believers, because your bodies will be
made so glorious in the resurrection, when all
blemishes of nature will be healed, and all sick|ness
and pain will be removed, because they will
be raised in incorruption, and freed from any more
dominion of death for ever.</P>
<P>2. Think what <HI>Souls</HI> you shall have; you will
be glorious without, your bodies will shine; but
you will be far more glorious within, your souls
will shine much more; then your souls shall be
washed clean from all remainders of sin, so that
they shall not have the least spot or stain; then
you shall be cleansed from all filthiness of flesh
and spirit, and arrive unto perfection of holi|ness;
then the feeds of grace will be grown up
into the flowers of glory, and O what a fragrant
garden will your souls be? when the rude draught,
as it were of Christ here in your hearts, shall be finished
and perfected by Gods Pensil, and your
spirits shall be made perfectly like unto your glo|rious
Lord, O how beautiful will they be in the
eyes of God!</P>
<P>Rejoice then believers, rejoice! it grieveth
you when you look within you, and perceive so
much remaining defilement; when you feel such
strong opposition of the flesh against the spirit, and
you finde your selves sometimes foiled thereby,
your weaknesses and infirmities trouble you; but
rejoyce believers, because in Heaven you will be
perfectly freed from sin, you will never be foiled
nor defiled with it any more, but you will be
made perfectly holy, and perfectly happy.</P>
<P>3. Think what <HI>habitations</HI> ye shall have; you
shall have <HI>Mansions in the Fathers house,</HI> Joh. 14.
<PB N="276" REF="143">
2. <HI>A building of God, a house not made with hands,
eternal in the Heavens, 2 Cor.</HI> 5. 1. your persons
will be glorious, and your habitations will be glo|rious.</P>
<P>Rejoyce then believers, rejoyce! what though
some of you live in poor and mean cottages; then
you shall live in the glorious? Pallace of the King
of Kings; what though your houses have been
burned with fire, and some of you have not
where to lay your head, and none of you have
a certain dwelling place which you can secure to
your selves? yet rejoyce because there are Man|sions
provided for you, out of which it will be
impossible for you to be burned or turned out for
ever. The City which is above hath foundations
which cannot be over turned, and the building
of God which is not made with hands, cannot be
destroyed by hands, neither is exposed to flames
of fire, which may demolish the fairest City in
the world.</P>
<P>4. Think what <HI>Company</HI> you shall have: you
shall have the presence of the Father, you shall
dwell with the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit
of God will dwell in you for ever; you shall
have the company of holy Angels, and all the
glorified Saints; all your companions will be
most lovely and glorious.</P>
<P>Rejoyce then believers rejoyce! what though
wicked men separate you from their company, and
think you unworthy of their fellowship? God will
not think you unworthy of his fellowship, nor
separate you from his presence; what though
some of you are forced to dwell in <HI>Meseck,</HI> and
are linked in neer relations to some ungodly
persons, and are every day vexed with their un|godly
<PB N="277" REF="143">
conversation? Rejoyce, for in Heaven
you will be freed from such company, no wic|ked
person will be permitted to come into that
place.</P>
<P>5. Think what <HI>Treasures</HI> you shall have; you
shall have Treasures which cannot be corrupted
by moth, nor stoln by thief, your riches will be
durable and unsearchable.</P>
<P>Rejoice then believers, rejoice! what though
you are poor in the world? you are rich in saith,
and hope; what though you have no inheritance
on earth? yet you are heirs of the Kingdom of
Heaven, you shall have an inheritance which is
incorruptible, and undefiled; what though you
indure some hardship in your journey through the
world? when you come home to your Fathers
house you shall be freed from all want, and have
such treasures to spend upon, which can never be
exhausted.</P>
<P>6. Think what <HI>Honours</HI> you shall have; the mea|nest
of you will be exalted unto higher dignity
than the greatest Monarch that ever lived; you
will be crowned with immortal glory, you will
be honoured by God and the Angels; and you
will not only have honour, but you will be made
most honourable.</P>
<P>Rejoice then believers, and take comfort,
though you are scorned by some, and accounted
as the off-scouring of the earth; you are reproa|ched
and vilified by men here, but all your re|proaches,
especially those which you have born for
the sake of Jesus Christ, shall be wreathed into a
Crown, and make you the more glorious in Hea|ven;
there you shall not have the least disgrace
cast upon you any more; and you shall be kept
<PB N="278" REF="144">
from doing any unbecoming action to blot and
sullie you in the least, but you shall shine like
so many Stars, or glorious Suns in the Kingdom of
your Father.</P>
<P>7. Think what <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Rest</HI> you shall have;
you shall have a most sweet peace and tranquilitie
of mind, no enemie without to disturb and mo|lest
you, no devil to tempt and assault you, no
lusts within, or distempered passion to disquiet
you; then you shall have perfect peace; and
then you shall rest from all wearisome imploi|ments,
and take up your repose in God for
ever.</P>
<P>Rejoice then believers, and set this chear your
hearts in your passage through the tempestuous
sea of this world; ere long you will come to the
haven, where there will be no waves nor winds;
sometimes now you are troubled on every side,
and have no rest in your spirits; without are
fightings, within are fears; but in Heaven you
shall be freed perfectlie from all disturbance and
molestation.</P>
<P>8. Think what <HI>Ioyes</HI> and <HI>Pleasures</HI> you shall
have; you shall have fulness of Joy, <HI>Psal.</HI> 16. 11.
you shall drink of the rivers of pleasures, <HI>Psal.</HI>
36. 8. O the delights which you shall have in
the immediate views of Gods face, in the sense
of Gods love, in the high actings of your love;
in the fruition of the chiefest good, and the
high emploiment which you shall have in Hea|ven.</P>
<P>Rejoice then believers, rejoice in hope of
these joyes; now you mourn and weep for your
sin, and because of the eclipses of the light
of Gods countenance; it troubles your hearts
<PB N="279" REF="144">
that you can see and enjoy so little of God, that
your love is so low and inconstant, that your
highest services are but mean, and diverted many
times by little trifling businesses in the world, from
converse with God; in heaven all tears will be
wiped away from your eyes, and all sorrow, with
all the grounds thereof will be removed, you
will come with singing into the new <HI>Ierusa|lem;</HI>
you will enter and live in the vision and
fruition, in the love and joy, and spend an eter|nity
in the praise of the Lord.</P>
<P>2. Believers, consider the <HI>sureness</HI> of the hap|piness
of Heaven; as surely as you are believers,
so surely shall you obtain this happiness; you
cannot be sure of any thing in the world, but
you may be sure of the glory of heaven, and
though there be not the <HI>certitudo subjecti:</HI> and
many of you be not assured of it, but are full
of doubts and fears that you shall fall short;
yet there is <HI>certitudo objecti,</HI> the thing is sure to
you.</P>
<P>Rejoice then believers, rejoice! your names
are written in the book of life, our of which they
shall never be blotted, labour to answer your
doubts, and to get your hearts wrought up to a
full assurance of this happiness, by such arguments
as these, which will evidently prove, that if you
be true believers, you shall not, you cannot miss
of Heaven.</P>
<P>I. God hath chosen you to glory, he hath e|lected
you to salvation before the world was,
<HI>Act. 13. 48. As many as were ordained to eternal life,
believed.</HI> Hence it follows, that all believers were
ordained to eternal life; and I <HI>Thes. 2. 13. God
hath chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of
<PB N="280" REF="145">
the spirit, and beliefe of the truth.</HI> All true belie|vers
are elected persons, and Gods decree of
election cannot be frustrated, because God is
unchangeable; because God changeth not, there|fore
you are not consumed; because God changeth
not, therefore you shall be saved.</P>
<P>2. God hath promised this happiness to you,
I <HI>Iohn 2. 24. This is the promise which he hath pro|mised,
even eternal life.</HI> And <HI>Tit. 1. 2. In hope of
eternal life, which God who cannot lie hath promised.</HI>
If God hath promised this happiness, and your
faith doth give you interest in the promises, and
God be faithful to fulfil to them, it being impos|sible
for God to lie; then as certainly as God is
true, you that are believers shall obtain.</P>
<P>3. The Lord Jesus Christ hath purchased this
happiness for you, it is called the purchased pos|fession,
<HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 14. as certain as the purchase, so
certain will be the possession.</P>
<P>4. The Lord Jesus hath taken possession of Hea|ven
for you, <HI>The fore-runner is for us entred, Heb.</HI>
6. 20. He is preparing these mansions in the fathers
house for you, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 14. 2. and as certain as Christ
is in Heaven, so certainly shall those that are be|lievers
be received thither in time.</P>
<P>5. Christ praied that you might have this hap|piness
whilst he was on the earth, <HI>Iah.</HI> 17. 24.
<HI>Father I will that those which thou host given me, be
with me where I am, that they may behold the glory
which thou host given me.</HI> Which prayer was made
for you, if believers, as well as for his present
Disciples, <HI>v. 20. Neither pray I for these alone, but
for them also which shall believe on me through their
word.</HI> And for this thing Chirst intercedes above,
and whatever he praies and intercedes for, he
<PB N="281" REF="145">
will prevail for you, and therefore you will obtain.</P>
<P>6. Ye are Christs, as ye are believers, and
therefore all things are yours, saith the Apo|stle,
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 22, 23. amongst which, things to
come are enumerated; ye are Christs servants,
and do his work, and he will give you your wa|ges;
You honour him in the world, and therefore
you shall be honoured by him; You follow your
Master in a way of self-denial and suffering, <HI>and
if you suffer with him, you shall reign with him,</HI> 2
<HI>Tim. 2. 12. and be glorified together, Rom.</HI> 8. 17. and
<HI>where Christ is, there shall his servants be, Ioh.</HI> 12.
26. Ye are Christs members, and where the head
is, there shall the members be; Ye are Christs
Sponse, you are joined, married to him, and there|fore
shall live with him, all the powers of earth
and hell, cannot separate you from his love, and
therefore cannot keep you out of heaven, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.
35, 36, 37, 38, 39.</P>
<P>7. Ye are justified by faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 1. and there|fore
absolved from the guilt of sin, therefore freed
from the condemnation of hell, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 1. therefore
shall not perish, seeing the cause thereof is remo|ved,
therfore you shall have eternal life, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 3. 16.
whom God justifieth, them he also glorifieth,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 30.</P>
<P>8. Yee are the adopted children of God, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.
26. <HI>For ye are all the Children of God, by faith in
Iesus Christ.</HI> And <HI>if children, then heirs, Rom.</HI> 8. 17.
and if heirs, you shall be sure to have the inheri|tance.</P>
<P>9. Ye are called with a Holy calling, and san|ctified
with the holy Spirit, and thereby in some
measure fitted and qualified for this happiness by
the work of grace, consormity to the Lord in ho|liness;
<PB N="282" REF="146">
grace is glory begun, and is called eternal
life, and God hath promised to perfect it, <HI>Philip.</HI>
1. 6. grace hath relation to Heaven, as sin hath re|lation
to hell; and as sin will certainly bring men
to hell if it be not pardoned, and subdued; so grace
will certainly bring men to heaven, because it
cannot be wholly eradicated.</P>
<P>10. You have made choice of Heaven for your
portion, you have laid up there your treasure, and
God hath set your souls a longing after it, and gi|ven
you hopes of it; and therefore you shall not
miss it, your desires shall be satisfied, and your
hopes shall not make you ashamed, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 5.</P>
<P>11. And if besides all this, you have the witness,
and seal, and earnest of the spirit, giving you
some first fruits, and foretastes of this happiness;
(though all believers do not obtain it) then you may
know without question, that this is a sure happi|ness,
both in its self, and unto you.</P>
<P>Therefore believers exercise your faith, that you
may be filled with all joy and peace in believing.</P>
<P>3. Believers consider the <HI>neerness</HI> of the happi|ness
of Heaven, Christs appearance is not far off,
but your happiness may be neerer, I mean the hap|piness
of your souls in Heaven, which will begin,
so soon as your lives come to an end: the wicked
walk upon the brink of Hell every day, when they
die, thither they are carried; you walk upon the
borders of the Heavenly Canaan, the Paradise
which is above, when you die, thither you shall
be conveyed; and you may die suddenlie, and as
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ddenlie you will be in glory.</P>
<P>Rejoice then believers, rejoice! you may be in
Heaven before you are aware; it may be to mor|row
God will send for you, within a few daies
<PB N="283" REF="146">
you may be out of the body, and present with
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he Lord Jesus, and amongst the spirits of just
Men made perfect; when you break Prison from
the body, you will be delivered into the marve|lous
light of Gods glory; rejoice to think how
neer your happiness is.</P>
<P>4. Believers consider the <HI>everlastingness</HI> of the
happiness of Heaven, there is fulness of joy and
<HI>pleasures for evermore; Psal.</HI> 18. 11. When you
are come to Heaven, there you shall abide, your
happiness will be constant and eternal, without
diminution, intermixture of sin or sorrow, with|out
interruption, or possibility that ever it should
be brought to an end. It would alleviate the tor|ments
of the damned, if they had any hopes of
ever being let out of Hell; and it would weaken
the joyes of the Saints, yea fill them with unspeak|able
grief, if there were any danger and fear of
being ever thrust out of Heaven.</P>
<P>Rejoice then yee believers; yee shall rejoice
for evermore in the eternal vision and fruition of
God, labour to begin your Heavens joyes now;
let faith so realize and bring neer the things
which you hope for, and make evident the things
which as yet you do not see, but shall possess,
that you may have a sweet foretaste of this happi|ness;
and begin your Heavens work to praise the
Lord for his great and undeserved love where|with
he hath loved you, and for those things be|yond
conception, which out of love he hath pre|pared
for you.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<P>_LAstly to conclude, I shall speak a word both to
<HI>Sinners</HI> and <HI>Believers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="147">
Will the Lord Jesus Christ certainly and quick|ly
appear to judgment? let me then in his name
perswade you to <HI>three</HI> things.</P>
<P>1. Believe that Christ will appear, mingle the
Doctrine you have heard or read, with faith; you
have had evident proofs of it, believe the thing.</P>
<P>Sinners believe that Christ will come to judge
and condemn you, if you be found in your sins,
did you believe it effectually, you would quickly
become Saints.</P>
<P>Believers labour for more faith in this truth, did
you believe&punc; it more strongly, you would live at a
higher rate.</P>
<P>2. Consider that Christ will appear; meditate
on this thing, let it dwell in your thoughts, let it
lie down with you at night, and arise with you in
the morning, let it sit down with you at Table,
and walk with you abroad; think often of the an|tecedents
of Christs coming, the judgment it self
and the consequents thereof, and get a deep im|pression
of the last Judgment upon your spirits.</P>
<P>Sinners, consider how the wicked will be judg|ed,
think how they will be accused and condemned,
think of the dreadful sentence, and the execution
thereof in Hell, and then think that you are in
the number of those that are in such danger, un|less
you speedily secure your selves, by making
your peace.</P>
<P>Believers, consider how the Saints will be judg|ed,
think how Christ will acquit them, and invite
them to take possession, and then will give them
possession of Heaven; and then think that you are
in the number of these blessed ones, which shall
be made thus happy.</P>
<P>3. Prepare for the appearance of Christ to judg|ment,
<PB N="285" REF="147">
and that you may be prepared, as a conclu|sion
to this Doctrine, take these directions.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Be diligent, that yee may be found of him in
peace,</HI> it is the advice of the Apostle, after his dis|course
of the coming of the Lord, and the glorious
things of that day. <HI>Wherefore beloved, seeing
that yee look for such things, be diligent, that yee
may be found of him in peace. 2 Pet.</HI> 3. 14.</P>
<P>1. Make your peace with God; sinners God is
your enemy, make your peace with him; you have
offended him by your sins, and his justice must be
satisfied, O labour to ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> an interest in the satisfa|ction
of Christ, that your sins may be pardoned,
and God may be reconciled; lay hold on Christ by
faith, as yet you may be welcome to him, here|after,
it will be too late. Believers, make sure of
a pardon, you cannot be too sure in a thing of such
concernment.</P>
<P>2. Diligently endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">after peace in your
consciences; sinners, get the wounds which fin
hath made there, healed with the blood of Christ;
Believers, take heed of making any breaches
there, maintain peace within, when you have ob|tained
it.</P>
<P>3. Diligently follow after peace one with ano|ther,
take heed of hatred, variance, emulations,
wraths, strifes, seditions, envyings, divisions, cla|mours,
evil-speakings, back-bitings, whisperings,
swellings, tumults; and follow after those things
which make for peace, as love, joy, humbleness of
minde, meekness, long-suffering, patience, and the
like, that you may be found of the Lord in
peace.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Give diligence, that yee may be found of the
Lord, without spot, and blameless,</HI> as the Apostle
<PB N="286" REF="148">
doth advise in the same 14. <HI>vers.</HI> And read <HI>ver.</HI> 11

your works.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Sit loose from the World,</HI> let not your hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>4. <HI>Lay up your treasure in Heaven, Matth. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

ever afflictions yee suffer for Christ, they are light
and momentany, but the glory which Christ will
give, is weighty and eternal. 2 Cor. 4. 17.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Give Christ your hearts,</HI> let him have the
highest room, give him your whole heart, let him
have the choicest and chiefest of your affections;
and then he will give you his Kingdome, and such
expressions of his love will he make unto you at
his appearance, as now you have not thoughts to
conceive.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Maintain communion with Christ in his Or|dinances;</HI>
prize Ordinances upon this account, be|cause
Christ doth walk there; and improve Ordi|nances
for this end, that you may meet with Christ;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">est not in the out-side and carnal part of Ordinan|ces,

<P>8. <HI>Stand up for the honour of Christ in the World,</HI>

<P>9. <HI>Improve your Talents for the use of the Lord,

<P>10. <HI>Stand upon your Watch;</HI> when our Saviour had fore|told
his Disciples of his coming, he exhorts them, and all
to watch, <HI>Mark 13. 37. What I say unto you, I say unto all,
watch.</HI> Watch against sin; watch your senses, which are
the inlets of sin; watch your hearts, from whence are the
issues of sin; watch, take heed of sleeping in sin, least you
lose your Garm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nts, and be found naked.</P>
<P>11. Be frequent and fervent in Prayer, our Saviour joyns
these duties together in his exho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tation of his Disciples:
<HI>Luke 21. 36. Watch&punc; yee therefore, and pray alwayes, that yee
may be counted worthy to escape all these things, which shall
come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.</HI> Pray with|out
ceasing, pray without fainting, be often upon your knees,
and be earnest with the Lord, that he would prepare you for
this day, that he would deliver you from that dreadful wrath
which shall be revealed when Christ doth appear, and which
you have deserved for your sins: and pray that he would give
you those qualifications, as may embolden you at the last day
to hold up your heads with confidence; that he would keep you
without spot, and blameless until the coming of the Lord.</P>
<P>12. And lastly, <HI>Look for the appearance of the Lord;
look with</HI> an <HI>eye of hope,</HI> labour to abound in hope, by the
power of the Holy Ghost, and let this hope be an Anchor fastned
within the Vail, to stay your sinking hearts in the

in the World; and look with an <HI>eye of desire;</HI> look and long
for Christs appearance; dart up your wishes often to Heaven&punc;
O when shall we see the Heavens opened, and behold our
Lord in his Glory? When shall we hear the Trumpet sound
and be gathered by the Angels from all the quarters of the
Earth? When shall we put off this dust and corruption,
and be cloathed with robes of immortality? When will the
Lord Jesus come down, and show us his glory, and receive
us to himself, that where he is, there we may be also? Christ
