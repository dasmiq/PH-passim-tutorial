<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Was never so proud, as to think I could write any thing that might abide the test of your judicious eye; what I now send, appeales to your Can|dor, intreating you to lay aside the per|son
<PB REF="3">
of a Iudge, for that of a Friend. It is at best but a Pamph|let, whether you con|sider its bulke, or worth. The result of a few pensive houres spent in recollecting what the memory had registred from publike observance, or private reading, in a Theme so sadly co|pious as this is. If it be not impertinent to tell you what hin|ted to this trifle, it
<PB REF="3">
was this; Having had opportunity to looke abroad into the world, I tooke some notice of the Contra|stos of the Italian Princes; I remark'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> griping <HI>Portugal</HI>; his grounds for the challenge of that Kingdome, &amp; his way of manag|ing those grounds; I lookt upon his me|thod of propagating Christianity in the West: (where one
<PB REF="4">
saies the Indian is bound to be religi|ous and poore upon pain of death.) More|over, I observed with what Artifice the Pope moderated in the European quar|rels, and with what devices he twisted the Gops<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, and the Advantage of the Chaire toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hir; and in all the struglings and disputes, that have of late years be|falne this corner of
<PB REF="4">
the: World, I found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat although the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">letence was, fiue and spirituall, yet the ultimate end, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">sedpe, was gold, and greatnesse, and se|cular glory.</P>
<P>But (my Lord) to come nearer, when I saw Kingdomes tot|tering, one Nation beeding against ano|ther, yea, one piece of a Nation justling the other, and split into so many parties, and
<PB REF="5">
petty enmities: and each of these quoting Bible to palliate his mad, and exorbitant opinions; I sigh'd, and it grieved mee to see popular easinesse, and well-meaning abus'd by Ambiti|ous self-seeking men; for there is a Genera|tion that is born to bee the plague, and disquiet, and scourge of the Age it lives in; that gladly sacrifice the publike peace to
<PB REF="5">
private interest; and when they see all fi|red, with joy warme their hands at those unhappy flames, which themselves kindle, tuning their merry Harps; when others are weeping over a kingdomes fu|nerall.</P>
<P>But above all, it pierced my heart to see the Clergy in such an high degree accessory to the civill distempers, and con|tentions
<PB REF="6">
that have every where shak'd the Foundations of Church and State; so that (as a Catholike noted) there hath been no floud of mi|sery, but did spring from, or at least was much swel'd by their Holy-water. I search|ed Evangelicall Re|cords, and there was nothing but milde and soft Do|ctrines, I inquired in|to the breathings of
<PB REF="6">
the Spirit, and they were pacificatory; I wondered from what Precedents and Scrip|ture incouragements these men deduc'd their practises; and at last was forced to conclude, that they were only pretended Chaplaines to the Prince of Peace; Those Torches that should have been for saving Light, were degenerated into fire|brands; Those Trum|pets
<PB REF="7">
that should have sounded retreats to popular furies, knew no other musicke but Martiall All-armes.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured in the sequell to re|present to you the Arts of Ambition by giving you the pi|cture of a person o|ver covetous of glo|ry, the peice is course, but yet like; drawne onely in water co|lours, which some of greater Leisure and
<PB REF="7">
Abilities may possi|bly hereafter lay in oyle.</P>
<P>You know that the desires of man are vast as his thoughts, boundless as the Ocean, <GAP DESC="foreign">, A bored tub is not more insatiate. Tis pity that great|nesse should at any time be out of the Rode of goodnesse; and I would some|times, if I durst, with
<PB REF="8">
<HI>Socrates,</HI> curse him that first separated pro|fitable and honest&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>It does to me a lit|tle relish of Paradox, that where ever I come, <HI>Machiavell</HI> is verbally curs'd and damn'd, and yet pra|ctically imbraced and asserted; for there is no Kingdome but hath a Race of men that are ingenious at the perill of the pub|like; so that as one said of <HI>Galba</HI> in re|spect
<PB REF="8">
of his crooked body: <HI>Ingenium Galbae mal&egrave; habitat</HI>; so may I say of these in re|gard of their crooked use; That wit could not have chosen a worse mansion, then where it is viriated, and made a Pander to wickednesse.</P>
<P>If you aske mee what I mean to trou|ble the world, that is already under such a glut of Books? You may easily perceive
<PB REF="9">
that I consulted not at all with advanta|ging my name, or wooing publike e|steeme by what I now write; I knew there was much of naked truth in it, and though it might pos|sibly be of some cau|tion to prevent the insinuation of pious frauds, and Religious fallacies into my na|tive Country: If any plaine-hearted, ho|nest man shall cast a|way

an houre in per|using it, he may per|haps finde something in it resembling his owne thoughts, and not altogether strange to his owne experience. It is not the least of our mis|fortunes, that sins and vices are cost times endear'd to us by false Titles and Comple|ments: being cou|zened with a speci|ous name, though much incoherent to

<HEAD>A Praemonition.</HEAD>
<P>It is farre from the de|signe of this Treatise, to derogate from the ho|nour of the calling, or worth of the person of any sober Statesman; 'Tis a know|ledge that no man observes with more due respects then my selfe; Because, I know it is no meane degree essen|tiall to the peace, and flou|rishing condition of a King|dome or Common-wealth. 'Tis a jewell to be lock'd up in some few rare Cabinets,
<PB REF="13">
and not to be made cheape, and expos'd to irreverence, by being bared, and prosti|tuted to every vulgar eye. The <HI>Pseudo-Policy</HI> here mention'd is contradistinct to that science, which is e|ver built upon piety and prudence; for upon these solid Bases, your wise Ar|chitect delights to raises he glorious superstructure of government in a Prince, and subjection in a people: so knitting the Interest of both with reciprocall mix|ture, that the welfare of the one may be involv'd in the good of the other: the Majesty may be preserv'd in its just splendor, and ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

the Liberty of the Subject remaine inviolate: Hee is the <HI>Atlas</HI> of the falling State, cures it when sicke, sets it when dis-joynted, meets it in its severall pres|sures with sutable reliefs. Such was <HI>Philip de Com|mines,</HI> of whom one said, it was a measuring cast, whether <HI>Lewis</HI> were the wiser King, or <HI>Philip</HI> the wiser Counsellour: such was <HI>Burleigh</HI> to our late Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> whose advise had very eminent influence into the prosperitie of her Reign, which was such, as I beleive few ages can paral|lel, and future times will read her happy Annals, as
<PB REF="14">
written like <HI>Xenophon's Cyrus, Non ad historiae fidem, sed ad exemplum justi imperij</HI>; So that if we love Peace, or Plenty, or Liberty, we are bound in way of acknowledgment to owne that in <HI>Plutarch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cato Ma|ior.</NOTE>

<P>But as the corruption of the best things makes them worst, so this noble know|ledge has been abused to loose and ambitious ends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ophyo|genes, &amp; Pfylli.</NOTE> by some men who seem to have suck'd the venome out of all politicks, misapplying what was good, and creating new according to the urgency of
<PB REF="14">
their own occasions, like the Lawes that were made in <HI>Causinus</HI> his <HI>Babel,</HI> to be|ru'd by manners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Furialibus commenta|riis illu|straut.</NOTE> and not manners by Lawes. They vex true Policy by misin|terpreting, and false glos|sing; framing in their hearts <HI>Diana's</HI> of hypocrisy and subtilty, and worship|ing them in their actions.</P>
<P>The Rules following there are few so silly as to beleive, though too many so wicked as to practise; and not only so, but by a bold imposture to perswade that such actions as are de|duc'd from these principles, are justifiable, and if for|tunate,
<PB REF="15">
commendable.</P>
<P>That all may see these Rocks, and shun them, and detest knavery though never so specious, and nauseate sinne, though robed in suc|cesses and triumphs, is my daily prayer.</P>

<HEAD>First Principle. The Polititian must have the shadow of Religion, but the substance hurts.</HEAD>
<P>_THere is no superstition in Politicks more odi|ous, then to stand too much uponni|ceties and scruples: and therefore <HI>Machiavel</HI> cut the haire, when he ad|vis'd, not absolutely to disavow conscience, but to manage it with such a
<PB REF="16">
prudent neglect, as is scarce discernable from a tendernesse: not per|mitting it to be techy and relucting, nor yet prostituting it, unlesse upon solemne and insu|perable occasion: Hee notes it from <HI>Papirius</HI> in <HI>Livy,</HI> who slighted the <HI>Pullarii</HI> handsomly, and was rewarded; whereas <HI>Appius Pulcher</HI> did it grosly, and was puni|shed.</P>

<P>Externall holinesse in|vites awfull regards; There is no mask that becomes Rebellion and Innovation so well as Religion; Nothing that so much conceals defor|mity, &amp; pretends beauty. 'Tis an excellent thing so to dissimulate piety, that when we act strong|ly against it, in that very article of wickednes the people Saint us: <HI>Herod</HI> would faine worship, when he means to wor|ry.

to some other interest. <HI>Lycurgus</HI> could never have ingratiated his Lawes so effectually, if he had not pretended a Dialogue w^t^h his God|desse. 'Tis to me indif|ferent, whether the Reli|gion I personate be true or false, so it be but po|pular: and if the people I meane to juggle with err fundamentally, I can by no means court them more, then by imbra|cing their delusion; It buckles them very close to me in morall obser|vance, to assist them in their spiritual soundnes, and mix with their di|stemper;

<HEAD>Principle II. Th&egrave; Politician must by all means make the most in|sinuating applications to the people that hee can; and lock up his owne de|signe, in pretence for Re|ligion, Liberty, Restitu|tion of Laws, Reforma|tion of Gabels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE prosperity of Innovation de|pends in a high measure upon the right knack of kindling and fomenting jealousies and dislikes in the people; and then weilding those grudges
<PB REF="22">
to the favour &amp; advan|tage of private ends; for the people are to the Polititian like tools to the Mechanick, he can performe nothing with|out them, they are his wings, his wheels, his Im+plements, the properties that he acts with.</P>
<P>That this may be done effectually, there must be an excellency in these following slights.</P>
<P>First, To assign such a cause of grievances, and such a course for redress, as may open a way to the alteration he ayms at: as if he means to alter the Government', or to in|gross
<PB REF="23">
the Supremacy, he must artificially con|vince of a necessity to arme, 1. Defensively, and if that succeeds, 2.

<P>Secondly, when hee sees opportunity to re|veale his own designe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> he must doe it gradually, and by peece-meale; for
<PB REF="23">
that which at one view would bee a Mormo to fright them, give it them in small parts, and they will digest it well e|nough.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Hee must compose his very garbe and gesture: 'tis a great matter to tell a lye with a grace; as, if Religion be the Mode, he must in his tales knock his breast, attest God, and invoke imprecations upon him|selfe, if hee does not doe that, which hee never in|tends.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Hee gives them good words, and bad Actions, like those
<PB REF="24">
the Historian brands with a <HI>Crudelitatem dam|natis, crudelitatem in|itis,</HI> ravishes them with apprehensions of Liber|ty, under the highest strain of oppression: for it is most certaine if, you please them with the name, they will imbrace it for name and thing.

<P>'Tis true, we may more justly pity him, that swallows a bait fair and glistring, than a per|son

that tempts tempta|tions to deceive him; or catches at Flies, and tri|fling allurements because in the first case a greater reluctancy is requisite, and the dart may possibly be so sharp, as to pierce through the Armour of a sober Resolution; But all this will little succour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im, who knows it to be a bait, and hath before|hand designed its beauty, and fairenesse, to apolo|gize for the foulnesse of the sin: for here the great|nesse of the Temptation will not at all extenuate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e grossenesse of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rime: No more than he

<P>The World is much mistaken in the value of a Scepter or Crown; we gaze upon its brightnesse, and forget its brittleness, we looke upon its glory, and forget its frailty; we respect its colour, and take no notice of its weight. But if all those gay things which wee fondly fancy to our selves were really to be found in Greatnesse, yet still he payes too deare, that pawn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his Heaven for it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he that thus buys a shor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>It will be little advan|tage here, to introduce the example of a Roman, or Turk, or Christian, if unlawfull; such presi|dents may perchance baf|fle the Vulgar (in whose Creede you may insert what you please) but wil be very cold answers, when we appeare before a severe Tribunall: It concernes us rather to observe how ambition claimes kindred with e|very other vice, stoops, and takes up every sinne

lies in its way; and, if up|on enquiry we finde it to bee indeed such a com|plicated mischiefe, it will become us studiously to shun it our selves, and se|riously to detest it in o|thers.</P>

<HEAD>Principle X. A generall Innovation con|tributes much to the growth and security of Vsurpation.</HEAD>
<P>WEE may receive this as a Traditi|on, handed to us from the great Patriarchs of Po|licy, attested by the pra|ctice of the subtilest times; I presume it may be grounded upon these, or the like Perswasions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because such an In|novation raises the dust, and begets a cloud for the main design; for when the waters are troubled, tis
<PB REF="76">
hard to see the bait.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because the Paren|thesis betwixt an old and new government, flatters the hopes of all parties, soothing those desirs that are for a relapse into the old, and yet incouraging those that wish for the establishment of a new.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because when all things are reduced into a Chaos and rude heape, when all the lines and Li|neaments of the former Government are blotted out, that which is new written will be more le|gible, and the old sooner forgotten: for suppose a Kingdom made a Lump,
<PB REF="76">
without shape and void, and it is like <HI>materia prima,</HI> prone to imbrace any form; when an In|strument is distun'd, you may set it to what key you please; and he that cannot sometimes lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the strings, will never make good Musick upon <HI>Synesius</HI> his Harp.</P>
<P N="4">4. Because by n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w moulding of Jurisdicti|ons, and offices of State, there may be a fair oppor|tunity offered, of gra|tifying those that have serv'd us; and for others its very familiar to see some stubborn and rigid opiniators, who have
<PB REF="77">
continued long unshaken either by threat or argu|ment, at length to surren|der their Principles, and bow the knee before the Dagon of Honou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Riches; such is the flex|animous power of golden Eloquence, as it is in the <HI>Adage,</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L></Q></P>
<P>Besides, we can find no better way to breed an absolute dependance, and make others adhere to our fortunes, then by winding the concern|ments of other men up|on the same bottom with
<PB REF="77">
our Interest; we may ob|serve this from the pra|ctice of great Favourites, who alwayes delight in these Props, and are care|full to set their whole Tribes in the sunshine of favour.</P>
<P N="5">5. Because such a ge|neral Deordination gives a taste and Rellish to the succeeding Government, though in its selfe not so delectable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</NOTE> for <HI>Aristotle</HI> notes, that Democracy is better than Anarchy.</P>
<P>There are many other advantages to be made by a due improvement of these turbid intervals; as the occasion of subdivi|ding,
<PB REF="78">
and parcelling out your great end; for by this meanes they which refused to close with it in grosse, will receive it in retaile: and having en|tertained some portions of it, the grudge they bore to the whole will be by degrees quieted and appeas'd.</P>
<P>Besides, when all things are ruffled and confused, it is then the Devils Ho|ly-day, and therefore our work-day: The noise is so loud, that it drowns the voice of the Lawe; and there may be some truth in his waggery, who sayd, That such as
<PB REF="78">
mean to commit a Rape upon the Body politick, must put out the Lawes; as others upon a like oc|casion use to put out the Lights.</P>
<P>Finally, If wee ever hope to sin with Impuni|ty, to usurp prosperously or to govern Arbitrarily; wee must take out that Lesson in <HI>Plantus</HI>:</P>
<P>Idem facere, quod plurimi alij, quibus Res timida aut Turbida est; Pergunt turba|re usque, ut ne quid possit conquiscere.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">

<HEAD>Colasterion.</HEAD>
<P>TIs most certain, that sinister ends are promoted by Innova|tions; but it lyes in our bosomes to promote or quench the Innovations themselves, which we can no way better do, than by a strict adherence to the Laws; for as long as we maintain them, they will maintain us: If we ob|serve these, it will rescue us from the hands of State-Novellists; for we are not fit for their turns, till we are cross-byassed with faction.</P>
<P><PB REF="79">As a caution against changes in Government, give me leave to repeate, what was long since told us by an ingenious Lord, &mdash; That all great mutati|ons are dangerous;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Faulkla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI></NOTE> even where what is introduc'd by that mutation, is such as would have been very profitable upon a prima|ry foundation: and it is none of the least dangers of change, that all the pe|rils and inconveniencies which it brings, cannot be foreseene; and therefore such as make title to wis|dome, will not undergo great dangers, but for great necessities.</P>
<P><PB REF="80">But further, let me ap|peale to generall experi|ence, yea, let me ask thee (Reader) if thou hast ne|ver before heard, or read of a Nation, that was once the gaze and envy of its Neighbours; and yet being insensible of its happiness, or possest with fond hopes of bettering its condition, has closed with pretended friends, and reall enemies, and gladly contributed to its owne ruine.</P>
<P>So apt men are to catch at the shadow, though they hazard the substance: we may guesse at the Morall of the Frogs
<PB REF="80">
in the Fable, who could finde no satisfaction in a still Prince, and were af|ter forced to abide the severities of a Tyrant they prayed for.</P>
<P>But if there be such distempers in a State, as shall necessarily require amendment; Let it be done with the Pruning|hook of the Law, and not with the Sword of vio|lence: For I never read, that Illegall, or Tumultu|ous, or Rebellious, were fit Epithets for Refor|mation. And 'tis fit Christians should forbear the use of such surly Physick, till they have
<PB REF="81">
levied a Fine in the Court of Heaven, and cut off the Intail of the seventh Bea|titude.</P>
<P>This may suffice to re|veale in some measure, <HI>Arcanum Ambitionis,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. I could add much more, but that I judge it a fitter task for our Nephews, when Pens shall be in|franchised.</P>
<P>And now (Reader) let us mix our prayers, that God would for ever ba|nish this cursed Policy out of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the whole Christian World; and damne it downe to Hell, from whence origi|nally
<PB REF="81">
it came, and let such as delight to abuse o|thers, thinke of that self|cousenage, with which in the interim they abuse themselves; God permit|ting the Devill to re|venge the Imposture. And whilst we are busie with politick stratagems, and tortious Armes to invade the rights of o|thers; Let us all consider that this is not the vio|lence which takes Hea|ven.</P>
<P>Let it be a piece of our daily Oraisons, that God would guard our Pulpits from such Boutefeus, as like <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tna</HI> and <HI>Vesuvius,</HI>
<PB REF="82">
belched out nothing but flames, and fiery discour|ses; using the Scripture as preposterously and impertinently, as some Pontificians, who trans|ported with the vehe|mence of Hildebrandian zeal, think the temporall Monarchy of Popes suffi|ciently Scripturall, from the saying of Christ to <HI>Peter &mdash; Pasce oves.</HI> Farr be it from us to intitle the Spirit of God to ex|orbitant doctrines, it is easie to distinguish the Vulture from the Dove. The miscarriages of the Clergy have a deeper stain from the sacredness
<PB REF="82">
of their function, as pro|bably he that invenomed the Eucharist has the more to answer for his Triple Crown.</P>
<P>It is manifest, that wee are fallen into the dregs of Time; we live in the rust of the Iron Age, and must accordingly expect to feel, <HI>V'tima se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">escentis mundi deliria,</HI> the dota|ges of a decrepit World: What is become of truth, sincerity, charity, humility, those <HI>Antiqui mores,</HI> whither are they gone? Did they attend <HI>Astraea</HI> into Heaven? And have left such degenerous successors, as cruelty,
<PB REF="83">
pride, fraud, envy, oppres|sion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such qualities as abundantly justifie the worst of Heathens, and dishonour the name of Christians: I thinke it may safely be affirmed, That if a new <HI>Europae spe|culum</HI> were sincerely writ|ten, it might be contract|ed into this short Sum|mary;</P>
