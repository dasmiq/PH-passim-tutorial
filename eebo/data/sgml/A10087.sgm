<LG>
<L>SVch honest minds as do desire to laugh,</L>
<L>When idle fools their foolish parts do play:</L>
<L>Let them herein peruse that broken staffe,</L>
<L>Where on proud <HI>Rome</HI> her shartered hopes doth lay.</L>
<L>And smiling then, say thus, time happen shall,</L>
<L>And that ere long when <HI>Dagon</HI> downe must fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Sea of <HI>Rome,</HI> growne to so low an ebbe,</L>
<L>To raise her fall doth vainly shifts deuise:</L>
<L>The <HI>Pope</HI> to spin his spitefull Spiders webbe.</L>
<L>Mainetaines a doctrine, diuellish teaching lies</L>
<L>For when on his proud head destruction comes,</L>
<L>For helpelesse helpe, to miracles he runs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great <HI>Brittons Ile,</HI> when on her fruitfull brest,</L>
<L>Hell breathed forth corruptions poysoned slime&punc;</L>
<L>And bloudy <HI>Romes</HI> adherents did their best.</L>
<L>To make their hellish hopes aloft to clime:</L>
<L>When at their top of height heauen them so cheks,</L>
<L>That helborne Climers breake their traytrous necks.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="4" MS="y">
<L>Then of that troope <HI>Cerberus</HI> their captaine chiefe,</L>
<L>Whose counsell did each secret ill direct,</L>
<L>False traytor <HI>Garnet</HI> that soule murthering thiefe,</L>
<L>His treason did each treasons plot protect,</L>
<L>Vpon his trust did damned sinne relie,</L>
<L>With hope to bring to passe, Arch villanie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When God was pleas'd at last to bring to light,</L>
<L>That twentie yeares concealed close kept deuell:</L>
<L>Who for the <HI>Pope</HI> with craft and greatest might,</L>
<L>Had closely wrought in framing workes of euill.</L>
<L>When Iustice him, most iustly did surprise,</L>
<L>Marke on his part, what hell did thus deuise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Finding himselfe, with danger round beset,</L>
<L>He standing still, men say, that thus he sayd:</L>
<L>In Gods name come, my life shall pay the debt.</L>
<L>Which must I know, to God by death be payd,</L>
<L>In forcest, he then himselfe did humbly yeeld:</L>
<L>Whose deadly poyson, would the world haue kild.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="4" MS="y">
<L>But where his right foote firmely fixed was,</L>
<L>In beaten path, hard, smooth and boordlike plaine:</L>
<L>Euen in that place, this wonder came to passe:</L>
<L>A wondrous grasse sprang forth (a lie) certaine,</L>
<L>Twelue inches long, two broad, and then, and there,</L>
<L>That Grasse was seene (most false) three crowns to beare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From hence it comes, our Papists vainely thinke,</L>
<L>That triple Crowned grasse did plainely show,</L>
<L>Though holy <HI>Garnet,</HI> chanced then to sinke,</L>
<L>The Pope should yet, to mightie greatnesse grow.</L>
<L>For <HI>Garnets</HI> death had force his cause to nourish,</L>
<L>And by his death, <HI>Romes</HI> sea should freshly flourish.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who so beleeues this Popish bold facest lie,</L>
<L>That's grounded on, suppos'd admired Grasse,</L>
<L>May fatly feed, his follies foolerie:</L>
<L>Yet liue indeed, a very leane fed Asse,</L>
<L>But falshood doth, such thrid-bare stuffe compound,</L>
<L>As that thereby, it doth it selfe confound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5" MS="y">
<L>This forged tale, may tell as I consider,</L>
<L>The scarlet whore, of bloud-desiring <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Her pompeous pride, like scatterd grasse shall wither:</L>
<L>And to destructions iudgement, shortly come,</L>
<L>And that in <HI>Brittons</HI> famous Monarchie,</L>
<L>In <HI>Garnets</HI> fall, <HI>Rome</HI> downe cast, falne doth lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But more then this, by him did strangely hap,</L>
<L>For aye to crowne his painted vertues name,</L>
<L>Oh wondrous was his threefold crowned cap:</L>
<L>His substance was, the child of shamelesse fame,</L>
<L>His life, and death, in very Popish troth,</L>
<L>Did bring admired lying wonders forth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For when he died, oh thing most strange to tell,</L>
<L>To a Taylors wife, a scipping silkmans beares,</L>
<L>A straw whereof, bloud from a traytor fell.</L>
<L>She thereon weepes, ruthfull deuotions teares,</L>
<L>To sight thereof she then her husband brings,</L>
<L>And ouer it, a mournefull durge he sings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5" MS="y">
<L>This holy rellicke, whilst (they say) she kept,</L>
<L>Some craftier knaue, then her poore plaine goseman:</L>
<L>To see that straw, deuoutly stealing crept.</L>
<L>And well to search each part thereof began,</L>
<L>At last whil'st he, to looke himselfe inclines,</L>
<L>Behold forsooth, a miracle he finds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For (though not) in the inward huske or rine,</L>
<L><HI>Garnets</HI> dead face (at London bridge) appeares,</L>
<L>This wonder proues he was indeed diuelline.</L>
<L>And all his workes, for treason doubtlesse cleares,</L>
<L>Some Popish painter cunningly did trace,</L>
<L>On <HI>Garnets</HI> straw, false <HI>Garnets</HI> trayterous face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But would you runne, that strange made straw to see,</L>
<L>And not for truth a Popish lie beleeue:</L>
<L>It's gone to <HI>Rome,</HI> there safely kept to be.</L>
<L>The Pope must weare it on his golden sleeue,</L>
<L>But zeales hot fire, wisely to asswage,</L>
<L>Let fooles trudge to it, in paultring pilgramage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="6" MS="y">
<L>False as themselues, this lie by them is coynd,</L>
<L>They'le first picke strawes, ere lying wonders loose,</L>
<L>Deceit haue they, with falshood falsly ioyn'd:</L>
<L>Lies to maintaine, they brasen lies must choose,</L>
<L>To force beliefe, by falshoods forsworne prate,</L>
<L>Papists dare boldly wrong, both Prince and State.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Pope, and Papists, close together ioyne,</L>
<L>Falsly to paint, a Popish painted grace,</L>
<L>Let still their wits, false truthlesse wonders coyne:</L>
<L>By painting strawes, with traytor <HI>Garnets</HI> face,</L>
<L>And let them lie, with flintie impudence,</L>
<L>In hell is placest, their certaine recumpence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Garnet</HI> misnam'd, of Iesus order hight,</L>
<L>A Iesuit knowne, and Iesuit fiercely they,</L>
<L>Gainst Iesus Christ, do with proud boldnesse fight.</L>
<L>And striue on earth, heauens blessed Saints to slay,</L>
<L>All Popish Iesuits seeming saintie,</L>
<L>Doth chiefly worke vild treasons villanie.</L>

<PB REF="6" MS="y">
<L><HI>Garnet</HI> their Martyr, whom they please to paint,</L>
<L>Him onely for a painted martyr take,</L>
<L>He was euen such a martyr, as a Saint.</L>
<L>Such Saints, and Martyrs, Popes haue power to make:</L>
<L>He dies no Saint, whose death maintaines a lie,</L>
<L>Nor are they Martyrs, that for treason die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But <HI>Garnet</HI> dead, he for his treason died,</L>
<L>False was his heart, desiring guiltlesse bloud,</L>
<L><HI>Equiuocations</HI> force his cunning tried.</L>
<L>Thereby to make his hel-borne actions good:</L>
<L>Fondly thinke not, for him strange strawes to see,</L>
<L>Not worth a straw, such patcht vp wonders be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But her's the iest, new strawes are painted now,</L>
<L>As if thereon two faithlesse faces stood:</L>
<L>Rightly to paint the painter well knew how,</L>
<L>For <HI>Garnet</HI> had two faces in one hood:</L>
<L><HI>Equiuocation</HI> his double face did cloake,</L>

<PB REF="7">
<L>Pope, Cardinals, Papists, blush all with shame,</L>
<L>To see your Iesuits lying shamelesse drift,</L>
<L>By miracle to crowne a traytors name:</L>
<L>With martyrdome and by so vild a shift,</L>
<L>Painting a fruitlesse straw, the worst of things,</L>
<L>Dirisions scorne, such painted wonder brings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They paint themselues, and what their church is made,</L>
<L>With straw they build their painted wals about:</L>
<L>Heauens fruitfull wheate they blasted in the blade.</L>
<L>Their corne is chaffe lifes ioyce themselues stampe out,</L>
<L>They and their Church, though painted faire we know,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Garnets</HI> straw is fruitlesse but in show.</L>

<L>With painted food feeding delusions ioy,</L>

<PB REF="7" MS="y">
<L>So are they fed, so they desire to feed,</L>

<L>But now the tale which strangely doth begild,</L>
<L>Amazed minds, or vaine, or faithlesse weake:</L>
<L>Oh a most strange surnam'd inspired child.</L>
<L>Hath power to heale before he right can speake,</L>
<L>His infant birth, a rowling Cradle shakes,</L>
<L>Yet if but toucht, sicke, haile, lame, sound he makes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From Popish parents, springs this inchanted bud,</L>
<L><HI>Romes</HI> faith alone workes mightie miracles,</L>
<L><HI>Sathans</HI> proud <HI>Popes</HI> haue boldly oft withstood:</L>

<L>Be that Religion rightly diuellish scand,</L>
<L>Whose strength must now by working wonders stand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall by a child more wonder now be wrought,</L>
<L>Then was by Christ the worlds redeemer done,</L>
<L>Shall misbeliefe (as if no truth were taught)</L>
<L>Teach vs (from God) for witch-like helpe to runne,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Parsons</HI> the Iesuit in his house at <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Hath in a gallerie gallantly set forth,</L>
<L>Such as in <HI>England</HI> suffred martyrdome:</L>
<L>Who first had vowed themselues to <HI>Rome</HI> by oath,</L>
<L>Each traytor hang'd, hangs for a martyr there,</L>

<LG>
<PB REF="9" MS="y">
<L>When he from <HI>England</HI> entertain'd a friend,</L>

<L>Behold deere friend these shrines angelicall,</L>
<L>Of martyrs crown'd with ioyes Celestiall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As at some motion then the foole begins,</L>

<L>We labored both for <HI>Englands</HI> happiest weale,</L>

<L>Lo what a coile a cunning traytor makes,</L>
