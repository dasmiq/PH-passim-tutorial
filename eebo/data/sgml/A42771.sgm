<P>_IT hath been a grand designe of the De|vil and Instruments acted by him, with much controversie to darken the light in the very breaking up of this present Reformati|on, and to hide the precious Truth that the simple should not finde it, such pure malice doth he carry against the <HI>high way</HI> of the Lord, and so afraid he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 35. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> is, that the Way-faring men shall not erre therein: but they know not the Counsel of the Lord, nor<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mich. 4. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></NOTE> the thoughts of his heart, who is about to clear the Truth, by the manifold Errours which have ri|sen in these late Times, to work His peoples hearts to a deep detestation of Errour, as well as ungodlines, and to declare his Truth, to be proofe of all the controversie that can be moved against it, when every Work shall be tried by the fire. There must be Heresies, for making manifest who<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 18 19.</NOTE> are approved, and what is precious and praise|worthy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zech. 14. 7.</NOTE> Truth, but at the Evening time it shall
<PB REF="3">
be light, and the Lord shall make Truth shine the more brightly, that it hath been for a time dark|ned and born down, this cloudie Morning shal end in a clear day. This litle treatise doth help to blow away and dispell the mists&punc; of Errour, and clear many questioned Truths, beside some points which are practically handled therein. If God had been pleased to lengthen the Author his life for longer serving his Generation, I am confident it would have come abroad better polished, if he had com|pleated it and there survayed the whole Work, when set together. But although this peece be un|perfect, yet having the Authors leave, I have ad|ventured to make it Publick, without any addition or alteration, the christian Reader will correct the Errata, and look upon it as it is his <HI>opus post|humu~,</HI> whom God made very serviceable in his work, in a very short time: I shall only wish that it may prove as useful and acceptable to the Iudici|ous and godly, as other peeces which came from his Pen.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the Ministery is a perpetuall Ordinance of Christ in the Church, and that Ministers are to bee received as the Embassadours of&punc; Christ, now aswell as in the Primitive times.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THat which hath long lurked in the hearts of many Atheists, is now professed and argued for, by that sierce furious <HI>Erastiane,</HI> whose book was published the last year at <HI>Fra|neker.</HI> He cryes out that the world is abused with that notion of a pre|tended sacred ministerial calling, that though the Apostles and others who first preached the Gospel, were indeed sent and set apart for that holy calling, which was also confirmed by signes and miracles, and they were therefore to bee received and submit|ted unto, as the Embassadours of Christ, yet Ministers and Pastours now are not to be acknowledged, as the Embassa|dours of Christ, neither is there any such thing now to be ac|knowledged, as a speciall distinct sacred calling, or solemne setting apart of men to the ministerie of the VVord and Sacra|ments, but any who is fit and gifted, though not called or or|dained, may both preach and minister the Sacraments, Bap|tisme and the Lords Supper. The Sect of <HI>Seekers</HI> also hold that there are not at this time, neither have been for many ages past any true Ministers or Embassadours of Christ. Now for confutation of these Errors, and for the confirmation and
<PB N="2" REF="10">
setlement of such as are any way shaken or troubled therewith, I have thought good here in the first place, to make sure this principle that the Ministery as it is distinct both from Magi|stracy, and from private Christians, is a perpetuall standing Ordinance of Christ in his Church to the end of the world. This I prove first from, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19, 20. That Commis|sion, <HI>Goe ye and teach all nations, baptising them, &amp;c:</HI> could not be meant of the Apostles onely or other Ministers of Christ at that time, respectively and personally, but must needs be ex|tended to true Preachers and baptisers in all ages to the end of the world, as is manifested by the promise added: <HI>and loe I am with you</HI> alway even <HI>unto the end of the world.</HI></P>
<P>2. From <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 11, 12, 13. Where the Ordinance of <HI>Pastors and Teachers,</HI> for the work of the Ministery reacheth as farre as the perfecting of the whole body of Christ, and the gathe|ring in of all the Elect, and consequently as far as the end of the world.</P>
<P>3. From those evangelicall prophesies and promises of Pa|stors and Teachers, <HI>Ier.</HI> 3. 15. <HI>and</HI> 23. 4. <HI>Isa.</HI> 30. 20. <HI>and</HI> 62. 6. 7. <HI>and</HI> 66. 21. <HI>Ezekiell</HI> 44. 23. which are not restricted to the Churches of the primitive times, but the true Churches of Christ in all ages interested therein.</P>
<P>4. Christ hath appointed his Gospell to bee preached to all nations, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24. 14. <HI>Luke</HI> 24. 47. and all the world over, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26. 13. and to every creature under heaven, <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 15. The preaching of the Gospell is the meane and way or|dained of God to save them that beleeve, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10&punc; 14. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 23. Now although there was a large spread of the Gospell in the Apostles times through so much of the world as was then knowne, yet that universall commission was not then so perfectly performed and fulfilled as it shall bee before the end be. And however all the Elect were not gathered in at that time, but many of them to be yet gathered in, which must bee
<PB N="3" REF="10">
done by preaching. And who can <GAP DESC="foreign"> but <GAP DESC="foreign"> who shall do the office of a Herauld, but he that is an Herauld? The holy Ghosts word used for preaching, is borrowed from Herauldry.</P>
<P>5. Christ hath appointed faithfull and wise stewards to bee rulers over his houshold, to give them their portion of meat in due season, <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 42. which was not appointed for the primitive times onely, but till he come again, as appeareth by verse. 43. <HI>Blessed is that servaut whom his Lord when he commeth shall finde so doing,</HI> and verse. 45. <HI>But and if that servant say in his heart, my Lord delayeth his comming,</HI> &amp;c. More of this Scripture afterwards.</P>
<P>6. From 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6. 14. The Apostles having in that Epistle given direction concerning Church officers, Bishops, Elders, Deacons, with many other particulars belonging to the Ministery, when he comes to the close of the Epistle, hee gives a strict and solemne charge to <HI>Timothie</HI> to <HI>keep this com|mandement, without spot, unrebukable, untill the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ,</HI> which cannot be understood of <HI>Timothy</HI> personally, but 'tis a charge given in his person to all the Mini|sters of the Gospell, who shall live till the appearing of Christ.</P>
<P>7. From <HI>Revel.</HI> 2. 24, 25. There is a charge, <HI>that which ye have alreadie hold fast till I come,</HI> and this charge is given to two sorts of persons. First <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>vobis,</HI> to you Bishops or Pa|stors, for there were more of them then one in <HI>Thyatira,</HI> as likewise in <HI>Philippie, Phil.</HI> 1. 1. Antioch, <HI>Act.</HI> 13. 2. and 15. 35. Ephesus, <HI>Act.</HI> 20. 17. 28. 36. 37. The like may be ob|served of other primitive Churches. Secondly, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>to the rest of you,</HI> viz. of the flock and body of the Church. As the charge cannot be restricted to the Church of <HI>Thyatira,</HI> no more can it bee restricted to the Ministery in <HI>Thyatira.</HI> But in them Christ chargeth all both Ministers and Church Members to hold fast the Jewell of the Gospell till he come again.</P>
<P>8. It is the Priviledge of the new Jerusalem which is above,
<PB N="4" REF="11">
that there is no temple therein, <HI>Revel.</HI> 21. 22. no Ministery, no Preaching, no Sacraments in heaven, but God shall be all in all. An Immediate enjoyment of God in this world without ordinances is but a delusion. In the Church triumphant pro|phecies shall faile, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 8. but in the Church militant, <HI>despyse not prophesyings,</HI> 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 20.</P>
<P>If any object (as some fanatick persons have done) <HI>Ier.</HI> 31. 34. and they shall teach no more every man his neigh|bour, &amp;c. 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2. 27. <HI>and ye need not that any man teach you.</HI> I answer first, These Scriptures are to be understood compa|ratively, in the same sence as God said, he would have mercy and not sacrifice, <HI>Hos.</HI> 6. 6. The Spirit of illumination and knowledge shall be so aboundantly powred forth under the Gospell, and God shall so writ his lawes in the hearts of his people, that there shall be almost as much difference between those under the old Covenant, and those under the new Co|venant, as there is between those that need a Teacher, and those that need not a Teacher. 2. <HI>As the Law is not made for a righteous man,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 9. <HI>viz.</HI> to compell him as with a bitte and bridle, for hee needeth no such compulsion, but obeyeth filially and willingly, yet the Law is made for a righteous man to bee a rule of obedience to him. So beleevers under the Gospell need not to bee taught by men as Ignorants are taught, they are not without understanding as the horse or the mule; <HI>for they shall all know me,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>Ier.</HI> 31. 32. <HI>and ye know all things.</HI> 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2. 20. yet they need a teaching Ministery for growing in knowledge; for their edification building up, for strengthning and confirming them, and for putting them in remembrance and stirring them up, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4. 12. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 12. and 3. 18. <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 9. There shall ever bee need of the Ministery, both to convert such as are not yet con|verted, and to confirme such as are converted. The Apostle 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3. 2. thought it necessary to send <HI>Timothy</HI> to the Church
<PB N="5" REF="11">
of the <HI>Thessalonians</HI> to establish them, and to comfort them. 3. As long as we are in this world, that promise that wee shall not need any man to teach us, is not perfectly fulfilled, for we know but in part, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 9. 12. we shall ever need a Teacher til we be in heaven and see Christ face to face. 4. And thus we must needs understand these Scriptures objected, unlesse we will make them to contradict other Scriptures, <HI>Ier.</HI> 3. 15. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 14. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 23. and how can a man understand with|out a Teacher, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 31.</P>
<P><HI>Object</HI> 2. But if we beleeve the Ministery to bee a perpetuall ordinance, and if there be a promise that Christ will bee with the Ministery to the end of the world, then wee must also be|leeve a succession of Ministers since the Apostles dayes, and that in the midst of Popery it self, Christ had a true Ministery. Answer, If our beleeving the holy Church universall, and that in all ages Christ hath had and shall have a true Church, doth not inferre that wee must beleeve the Church either alwayes visible, or alwayes pure, so our beleeving a perpetuall Ministe|ry, doeth not inferre that therefore wee must beleeve either a lineall or visible succession of Ministers, or their purity and preservation from error. There is nothing of this kinde can bee objected against our beleeving a perpetuall Ministery, but it falleth as heavy upon our beleife of the perpetuity of the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. The multitude of beleevers are under the new Testament made a <HI>royall Priest-hood,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 9. And Christ <HI>hath made us Kings and Priests unto God, Revel.</HI> 1. 6. Answer, First <HI>Peter</HI> explaineth himself, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 5. <HI>ye are anholy Priest|hood to offer up spirituall sacrifices acceptable to God by Iesus Christ.</HI> VVhat these spiritual sacrifices are we may finde in other Scrip|tures, the mortification of the flesh and offering up of our selves to God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 1. Contrition <HI>Psal.</HI> 51. 17. Prayer and supplications, <HI>Psal.</HI> 141. 2. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5. 7. <HI>Rev.</HI> 5. 8. thanks|givings,

<HI>Psal.</HI> 50. 14. 23. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 15&punc; almes deeds, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. 18. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 16. As to these all beleevers are indeed an holy Preist-hood, but not as to publick Ministeriall administrati|ons. 2. This objection drives at the taking away of Magistra|cy and civill government, aswell as of the Ministery, for Christ hath made beleevers Kings aswell as Priests, and if Kings then not Subjects. 3. The same thing was said to the people of Israel, <HI>Exod.</HI> 19. 6. <HI>and ye shall be unto me a kingdome of Priests,</HI> yet God appointed the sonnes of Aaron onely to be Priests, as to the publick administration of holy things&punc; 4. The same God who hath made Christians an holy Priest|hood, hath promised to the Church of the new Testament, that he will set a part and take from among them, or of them (by way of distinction and speciall calling) Priests who shall Minister before him in the holy things, <HI>Isa.</HI> 66. 21. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44. 15. 16. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whom hee calleth Priests not in the Jewish nor Popish sence, but for their offering up of the Gentiles to God by the preaching of the Gospel, and sanctified by the holy Ghost, <HI>Rom&punc;</HI> 15. 16. Or wee may conceave they are called Priests by the Prophets, that they might be the better under|stood, speaking in the language of those times: even as for the same reason when the Prophets spake of the Church of the new Testament, They mention mount Zion, Jerusalem, sacri|fices, incense, the feast of Tabernacles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But I must not forget what the <HI>Erastian Grallator</HI> with so much spite and deri|sion rejecteth, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is not onely a perpetuall Mini|stery in the Church, but that Ministers lawfully called, are to be receaved as the Embassadours of Christ, and as sent of God. If there must be a perpetuall Ministery yet. That child of the devill and Enemy of Christ (for hee can be no other who is an Enemy to the Ministery of the word and Sacra|ments) ceaseth not to pervert the right wayes of the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">He will by no meanes acknowledge any Ministers in the Re|formed Churches to be the Embassadours of Christ, though the Apostles were. It seemes he hates this name the more, because Embassadours by the law of Nations are inviolable persons, how much more the Embassadours of Christ? But let us now see whether the word of God gives not as high a rise and Authority even to the ordinary Ministery of the Gospell, as an Embassadour from Christ. When <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Wee are Embassadours from Christ,</HI> 2 Cor: 5. 20. he speaks it not in reference to any thing peculiarly apostolicall, or any thing incompetent to ordinary Ministers, the contrary is most plain from the Text it self, <HI>He hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation. Now then wee are Embassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, wee pray you in Christs stead, be yee reconciled to God.</HI> Now if <HI>Paul</HI> was the Embassadour of Christ, because he had committed unto him the word of re|conciliation, then all true Ministers of the Gospell are also the Embassadours of Christ for the same reason. See the like <HI>Eph:</HI> 6. 20. <HI>For which I am an Embassadour.</HI> for what? Not for working miracles, casting out Devills, planting Churches in severall Kingdoms, or the like, but for <HI>opening my mouth boldly, to make knowne the mistery of the Gospell,</HI> vers. 19. wherein he desires to be helped by the prayers of the Saints. By the same reason all faithfull and lawfully called Ministers are the Embassadours of Christ, as well as the Apostles: Even as un|der the old Testament, the Priests who were ordinary Teach|ers, and called in an ordinary mediat way, were the Angels or Messengers of the Lord of Hosts, <HI>Mal:</HI> 2. 7. as well as the Prophets. 2. <HI>Chron&punc;</HI> 36. 16&punc; So wise men and Scribes are said to be sent of God as well as prophets, <HI>Math.</HI> 23. 34.

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of the Election of Pastours with the Congregations consent.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe Question is not, whether the power of Ecclesiasti|call government, or jurisdiction belong to the peo|ple, or body of the Church&punc; (for the Tenents of <HI>Brownists</HI> and <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> concerning popular go|vernment, we utterly abhorre) nor whether the whole col|lective body of the Church ought to be assembled, and their voi es severally asked in Elections, for all may consent when none vote in Elections, but the representative body of the Church, nor whether the consent of the people to the admis|sion of a Pastor is to be sought and wished for, it being ge|nerally acknowledged by all, and denyed by none, that it is better to enter with the peoples consent then against it: Nor whether liberty ought to be granted to the whole congregati|on, or any member thereof to object against the mans life or doctrine, or against his qualificatio~ for such a particular charge, for it is certain that not only the congregation, but others who know any just impedime~t against his admissio~, have place to object the same, nor whether the churches liberty of con|sent be inconsistant with, or destructive unto the Presbyteries power of examinatio~ and ordination, for these may stand toge|ther: but the question is whether it be necessarily required to the right vocation of a Pastor, that he be freely elected by the votes of the Eldership, and with the consent (tacite or expres|sed)
<PB N="9" REF="13">
of the major or better part of the Congregation, so that he bee not obtruded, <HI>renitente, &amp; contradicente Ecclesia.</HI></P>
<P>The affirmative part of this question is proved from Scrip|ture, from antiquity, from Protestant writters, yea Churches and from sound reason, and from the confessions of opposites. To begin with Scripture, and with the primitive paterne, the Apostles themselves would not so much as make Deacons till all the seven were chosen, and presented unto them by the Church, <HI>Ast,</HI> 6. 2, 3, 5, 6: The Author of the Historie of Episcopacy, part, 2. <HI>pag.</HI> 359. To cut off our Argument from <HI>Acts</HI> 6. saith. That the seven were to be the stewards of the people in disposing of their goods, <HI>good reason that the election should be made by them, whose goods and fortunes were to bee disposed of,</HI> this answer was made by <HI>Bellarmine</HI> before him: But <HI>Walaeus</HI> tom. 2. <HI>pag.</HI> 52. reasoneth other wayes: the feeders of the peoples soules, must bee no lesse (if not more) beloved and acceptable then the feeders of their bodies; therefore these must be chosen with their own consent, as well as these. Secondly, Elders (both ruling and preaching) were chosen by most voices of the Church: the suffrages being signified, per <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, by lifting up, or stretching out of the hand, <HI>Act.</HI> 14. 23. Where the <HI>Syriak</HI> version doth in|sinuate, that the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, is not to be understood of the Apostles ordination of Elders, but of <HI>the Churches Election of Elders,</HI> thus, <HI>Moreover they made to themselves,</HI> that is, the Disciples mentioned in the former <HI>verse,</HI> made to them|selves, for they who were made, were not Elders or Mini|sters to <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> (<HI>but to the multitude of the Disciples</HI>) in every Church Elders <HI>while they were fasting with them and praying, and commending them, &amp;c.</HI> Now how could this Election be, but after the <HI>Graecian</HI> forme by the Churches lifting up, or stretching out of hands. But because some doe still stick at this place, it may bee further cleared, thus
<PB N="10" REF="14">
<GAP DESC="foreign">; It may be understood three wayes, and all these wayes it saveth the peoples right. It may be either the action of the Church onely, as the <HI>Syriak</HI> maketh it, or a joynt action both of the Churches, and of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> as <HI>Iu|nius</HI> maketh it; or an action of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> in this sense that they did constitute Elders to the Churches, by the Churches own voyces. However, the word relateth to Election by stretching out, or lifting up of hands, not to ordination by laying on of hands, which is the sense followed by the <HI>Italian</HI> version, and <HI>Diodati</HI> authorising and ordaining such a one on|ly to bee an Elder as was <GAP DESC="foreign">, which I prove, 1. From the native signification of the word, where <HI>Iulius Pollux</HI> hath <GAP DESC="foreign">. Lib. 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 4. <HI>Gualther</HI> and <HI>Wolf Seberus</HI> render it <HI>manuum extensio,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>manus levare,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>manibus refragari, Budaeus</HI> interpreteth, <GAP DESC="foreign"> to be <HI>plebis|citum, suffragium, H. Stephanus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>manum protendo; &amp; attollo manum porrigo:</HI> and because, saith he, in giving votes, they did <GAP DESC="foreign">, thence came the word to be used, for <HI>scisco, decerno, creo,</HI> but properly <GAP DESC="foreign">, is (saith he) as it were, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>id est,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Iustin Martyr, Quaest. &amp; Resp. ad orthod. Resp. ad quaest.</HI> 14. doeth expressely distinguish <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">. As words of a most different significati|on&punc; where <HI>Cedrenus Anno.</HI> 526. saith <HI>Euphranius</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Pilander,</HI> the interpreter rendereth, <HI>Episcopatui, communibus suffragiis deligitur. Scapula,</HI> and <HI>Arias Montanus</HI> also in his Lexi|con tells us, that <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>is manus porrigere,</HI> or <HI>elevare, eligere,</HI> or <HI>creare magistratum per fuffragia,</HI> for <GAP DESC="foreign"> is most diffe|rent from laying on of hands, which is not a stretching out or lifting up, but a leaning or laying down of the hands on some thing. Wherefore the <HI>Hebrews</HI> note laying on of hands by <HI>Samak, inniti Chrysostome</HI> saith the <HI>Roman</HI> Senat, did <GAP DESC="foreign"> which <HI>D: Potter</HI> himselfe turneth, did make gods by most voices; Charitie mistaken, <HI>pag</HI> 145. 2. The use of the
<PB N="11" REF="14">
word in this sense, and in no other sense, either in Scripture, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 19. or Greek authors that wrote before the new Testament. So that <HI>Luke</HI> could not be understood, if he had used it in another sense, but he wrote so that he might be un|derstood: If he had meant ordination, he would have used the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> as <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 3. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 5. or <GAP DESC="foreign">. as <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 6. 2. The manner of the Elections among the Graecians testified by <HI>Demosthenes, Cicero,</HI> and others, cleareth the meaning of the word. So they had a phrase <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>omnium suffragiis obtinet,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>no man giveth a contrarie vote.</HI> When the Grecians choised their Magistrates at their Comitia held solemnely for that end: he that was no|minated, was brought into the threater before the people, so many as aproved of him, held forth, or stretched forth, or lif|ted up their hands: If the major part did thus <GAP DESC="foreign">, hee partly was then said to bee <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Magistrate created by suffrages. So <HI>Elias Cretensis in Greg. Nazianz. orat.</HI> 3. I finde also in <HI>Aeschines orat&punc; contra Cetesipont,</HI> some decrees cited which mention three sorts of Magistrates, and among the rest <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Those that were made by the peoples suffrage.</HI> In the argument of <HI>Demosthenes</HI> his oration, <HI>advers. Androtion,</HI> these Magistrates are called <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Magistrates made by the peoples suffrage, Fronto Ducaeus</HI> in his notes upon the fifth tom. of <HI>Chrysostome pag</HI> 3. confesseth that with heathen writters <GAP DESC="foreign">, is <HI>per suffragia creare,</HI> and therefore the word is rendered in the <HI>Tigurine</HI> ver|sion, and by <HI>Calvin, Bullinger, Beza,</HI> and so doth <HI>Erasmus,</HI> upon the place understand the word: <HI>ut intelligamus,</HI> saith hee, <HI>suffragiis delectos.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="foreign">, joyned with <GAP DESC="foreign">, doth not at all make against that which I say, as some have concea|ved it doth, but rather for it, for <GAP DESC="foreign"> here is to bee rendred, <HI>ipsis</HI> not <HI>illis,</HI> and so <HI>Pasor&punc;</HI> in the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> rendereth, <HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23. <HI>quumque ipsis per suffragia creassent Presbyteros.</HI> So
<PB N="12" REF="15">
that <GAP DESC="foreign"> here is used for <GAP DESC="foreign"> that the Grecians sometimes use the one for the other. So <HI>H: Stephanus, Thes. ling. Gr.</HI> in the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, where he referreth us to <HI>Budaeus,</HI> for exam|ples to prove it, see the like, <HI>Matth.</HI> 12. 57: <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 2. Thus therefore the text may be conceaved, <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, and when they (the Disciples of <HI>Lystra, Iconium</HI> and <HI>Antioch</HI>) had by votes made to themselves El|ders in every Church, and had prayed with fasting, they com|mended them (to wit, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI>) <HI>to the Lord in whom they beleeved.</HI> It needeth not seeme strange, that here in one verse I make <GAP DESC="foreign"> to be <HI>ipsis,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> to be <HI>illos,</HI> and meant of different persons, for the like will frequently occurre in Scripture, <HI>Mark</HI> 2. 15. <HI>as Iesus sate at meat in his</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> (that is <HI>Levies</HI>) house, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>And they watched him, and they followed him</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>that is Iesus,</HI> Mark 3. <HI>whether he would heal him, here is</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> for <HI>Iesus,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> for the man, which had the withered hand, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 16. <HI>to reveal his Sonne in me, that I might preach him,</HI> here is <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>ip|sius,</HI> for God the father, and <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>illum</HI> for Christ. So then the Churches of <HI>Lystra, Iconium,</HI> and <HI>Antioch,</HI> after choo|sing of Elders, who were also solemnly set a part with prayer and fasting, were willing to let <HI>Paul,</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> goe from them to the planting and watering of other Churches, and commended them unto God, that would open unto them a wide and effectuall doore, and prosper the work of Christ in their hands, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6. 18. 19. Or they commended them unto God for their safety and preservation, as men are said to commend their owne spirits to God, <HI>Luke</HI> 23. 46. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4. 19. This sense and interpretation which I have onely offered to bee considered, doth not bring any harshnesse, and much lesse, offer any violence, either to the text or context in the Greek. But if another sense be liked better, whether to un|derstand
<PB N="13" REF="15">
by <GAP DESC="foreign"> the Elders ordained or the Churches com|mended to God by <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> or to understand all the particulars mentioned in that 23. <HI>verse</HI> to bee common and joynt acts done by <HI>Paul, Barnabas</HI> and the Churches, that is, that they all concurred in making them Elders by suffrage, in prayer and fasting, and in commending themselves to the Lord; I shall not contend so long as the proper and native signification of <GAP DESC="foreign"> is retained, yea; although wee should understand by this word, an act of <HI>Paul,</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> alone, distinct from the Churches suffrage and consent even in that sense, we lose not the argument; For first it cannot be supposed that the businesse was put to the lifting, or streth|ing out hands <HI>in signum suffragii,</HI> between <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> as if it had been put to the question between them two alone; whether such a man should bee Elder in such a Church. But how then can it be an act of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas?</HI> Thus if you will, Thir two did <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>creare suffragiis, vel per suffragia, id est;</HI> They ordained such men to bee Elders as were chosen by the Church. They two made or created the Elders, but the people declared by lifted up hands whom they would have to be Elders. So <HI>Calvin Instit.</HI> lib. 4. cap. 53. &sect; 15. Even as saith he, the Roman historians often tells us, that the con|sull who held the court, did creat new Magistrates, <HI>id est,</HI> did receave the vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">es and preside in the Elections.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Luke</HI> doeth usually mention the Churches suffrage in making Church Officers, or in designing men to sacred employments, as <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 23. 26. <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 3. <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 22. So doth <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16. 3. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 19. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 7.

It is there attribute to God <GAP DESC="foreign">, that in the councell of God the Apostles were in a manner Elected by voices of the Trinitie, <HI>as faciamus hominem, Gen.</HI> 1. and hindereth no more the pro|per signification of the word applyed to men, then <GAP DESC="foreign"> ascribed to God, can prove, that there is no change in men when they repent, because there is none in God. As for that objection made by a learned man, that even the <HI>Septuagints Isay</HI> 58. 9. have <GAP DESC="foreign"> not for <HI>extensio</HI> or <HI>elevatio manu|um,</HI> but for that which is in the Hebrew <HI>immissio</HI> or <HI>innixus digiti</HI> or <HI>manus.</HI> Answer, 1. It is not put for <HI>innixus di|giti,</HI> but for <HI>extensio digiti,</HI> for so is the text. 2. <HI>Sanctius</HI> following <HI>Cyrill,</HI> tells us that the sense of the 70. turning the text so; was this, <HI>Nempe hic intelligi suffragia quibus magistra|tus creantur, a quibus raro solet abesse munerum largitio &amp; corrup|tio juris.</HI> So that his argument may be retorted, I do not say that this is the Prophets meaning, but that it is the 70. their sense of the text in using that word, for the most Interpreters understand by putting forth the finger there, derision, and dis|dain. 3. The 70. certainly did not intend the putting on, but the putting out of the finger, so the <HI>Chaldee</HI> hath <HI>annuere digito, Heirome, extendere digitum,</HI> which well agreeth with the He|brew <HI>Shekach digitum extendere. i. e. malum opus perlongare,</HI> saith <HI>Hugo Cardinalis.</HI> It is saith <HI>Emanuel Sa, minando, aut convitiando,</HI> (which seemeth the true sense) The Jesuits of <HI>Doway</HI> read, and cease to stretch out the finger. <HI>Gualther</HI> read|eth <HI>emissionem digiti,</HI> and expondeth thus <HI>medij digiti, ostensio erat contemptus iudicium, digitis item minitamur,</HI> suppose none of all these signifie the laying on of the hands, or finger, but suppose that it is not laid on, and so much shall suffice con|cerning these Scriptures, <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 2, 3, 5. 6. and <HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23:</P>
<P>A third argument from Scripture shall be this. If the extra|ordinary

office bearers in these Primitive times were not chosen, nor put into their functions without the Churches consent, far lesse ought there now to bee any intrusion of or|dinary Ministers without the consent of the Church; <HI>Iudas</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were chosen with consent of the whole Church unto an extraordinarie embassage, <HI>Act.</HI> 15. 22.

Finally, the order of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is strengthened by the civil law of the Kingdome: For the second Parliament of King <HI>Charles,</HI> Act 7. did ordaine Pres|byteries to plant vacand Kirks with consent of the Parishes.

<P>In the fourth place, the point is confirmed from sound reason. For, 1.

It is much more necessary, that he bee well lyked and approved of them that are within the Church. 2. It is a common maxime among the Fathers, School|men,
<PB N="22" REF="20">
and Summists, <HI>Quod ad omnes pertinct ommium con|sensu siere debet.</HI> 3. As the free consent of people in the Electi|on, is a great obligation and ingagement, both to them, to Subject themselves in Christian and willing obedience to him, whom they have willingly chosen to be over them in the Lord, and to the person elected to love them, and to offer up himselfe gladly upon the service and sacrifice of their faith: So where this obligation or mutuall union of the hearts of Pastor and People is wanting, mutuall dueties are not done <GAP DESC="foreign">, but as it were by constraint and necessity, they in the mean time drawing back from the yoke, and hee, at the best watching over them, not with joy, but with grief and sor|row of heart. 4.

<P><PB N="23" REF="20">Lastly, I argue from the confessions of adversaries them|selves, we have cited before the confession of <HI>Bilson,</HI> and of the author of <HI>the history of Episcopacy,</HI> and of <HI>Salm&eacute;ron,</HI> I will adde <HI>Peresius de traditionibus,</HI> who undertaketh to confute the Protestant tenent, That it belongeth to the people to elect or reject their Ministers; Hee argueth from antiquity, and yet in that same argumentation, he is constrained to speak for us. For speaking of the three Bishops which by the ancient Ca|nons might ordain a Bishop, he sayeth, <HI>Verum tamen est quod Episcopi isti qui ad electionem Congregabantur, consensum expecta|bant cleri &amp; populiut in concilio carthaginensi quarto refertur, qui consensus magis erat testificatio vitae ejus qui erat ordinandus, &amp; signum quoddam expressivum ejus desiderii, quod volebat Paulus quando bonum testimonium populi dicebat expectandum ante ordina|tionem.</HI> Et infra. <HI>Hoc enim modo magis pretiosus esset illis praela|tus, magisque amabilis, ne cogerentur inviti inutiles homines, &amp; inter dum perniciosos suis sudoribus alere.</HI> And <HI>Answering</HI> to the passage of <HI>Cyprian lib:</HI> 2. <HI>Epist&punc;</HI> 5. he sayeth; That tho hee hath not read of it, yet <HI>forte erat mos tempore ejus in Ecclesiis Hispaniarum</HI> (for they were two <HI>Spanish</HI> Bishops of whom <HI>Cy|prian</HI> writs in that Epistle) <HI>ut aliqui ex populo vocem haberent, electivam.

<HI>the first principles of humane fellowships and Assemblies: For which cause, tho Bishops by Gods law have power to examine and ordain before any man be placed to take charge of Souls, yet bave they no power to impose a Pastor upon any Church against their wills.</HI> Hee citeth diverse testimonies of antiquity to shew that the ancient Elections were by the Church or the greater part thereof.</P>
<P>It remaineth to answer some objections. And first it is ob|jected, That this is a tenent of <HI>Anabaptists, Independents,</HI> and <HI>Separatists.</HI> Ans: 1. But shall we condemne these truthes which either they, or <HI>Papists,</HI> or <HI>Arrians</HI> doe hold? <HI>Quid est,</HI> saith Cyprian, <HI>quia hoc facit Novatianus ut nos non putemus esse faci|endum?</HI> We may goe one myle with the Scriptures, though we goe not two myles with the <HI>Independents,</HI> or three myles with the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> or <HI>Separatists.</HI> 2. Neither in this same point of Elections doe we homologat with them, who give to the collective body of the Church (women and children under age onely excepted) the power of decisive vote and suf|frage in Elections, we give the vote onely to the Eldership or Church representative, so that they carrie along with them the consent of the Major or better part of the Congregation. <HI>Gamachaeus in primam secundae quaest:</HI> 15 tells us out of <HI>Thomas</HI> this difference betwixt consent and election: that though every choosing bea consenting, yetevery consenting is not a choosing: The liberty of consent is one thing; counsell or deliberation another thing: The power of a decisive voice in court or judi|catory a third thing. I speak of a constituted Church (for where there is not yet an Eldership, there can be no such distinction: yet however bee there an Eldership or bee there none, the Churches consent must be had.) The first of these we ascribe to the whole Church, without whose knowledge and consent Ministers may not be intruded. The second to the ablest and wisest men of the Congregation, especially to Magistrates, with whose especiall advice, privity, and deliberation the
<PB N="25" REF="21">
mater ought to be managed. The third which is the formall, and consistoriall determination of the case of election, consist|eth in the votes of the Eldership: Their way is much diffe|rent from this, who would have the matter prepared by the conference, and deliberation of the Eldership, (as wee use to doe in Committees) but determined and decided by the votes of the whole Congregation. 3. Let them speak for us who have particularly written against the <HI>Separatists</HI> and <HI>Indepen|dents. Laget</HI> in his defence of Church-government, part. 1. cap: 1, In the stating of the question about popular govern|ment, declareth that the question is not, whether in maters of greater importance, and more publick concernment, (as ad|missions, excommunications, and absolutions of members, elections, and depositions of officers) the case ought to bee made known unto, and determined with the free consent of the people (for all this he willingly granteth.) But whether every cause to be determined, ought to be brought to the mul|titude, or body of the Congregation, and they to give their voices therein together with the officers of the Church.</P>
<P>M^r. <HI>Herle</HI> the reverend and learned prolocutor of the As|sembly of divines at <HI>Westminster</HI> in his treatise, intituled, <HI>The independency on Scriptures, of the independency of the Churches,</HI> pag: 3. While he stateth the question, saith, <HI>We acknowledge that the Pastors and other officers were ancientlie, and it is to be wish|ed they still were chosen (at least) consented to by the members of each respective Congregation: But that they are to bee ordained, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">posed, or excommunicated by the Presbyterie,</HI> &amp;c. Moreover they of the Separation, and if not all, yet (sure) some <HI>Inde|pendents</HI> place the whole essentiality of a calling in Election, accompting ordination to be no more but the solemnization of the calling. We say, <GAP DESC="foreign"> or the <HI>missio potestativa,</HI> or the power and commission given to a man, by which hee is made of no Minister to be a Minister, is not from the Churches electing
<PB N="26" REF="22">
him, but from the lawfull ordaining him: And that Election doth but designe such a person to the Ministery of such a Church. For as <HI>Gamachaeus</HI> sayeth in <HI>tertiam partem Thomae do Sacr: ordin: cap:</HI> 7. the people cannot give spirituall authori|ty which themselves have not: <HI>Et quamvis fateamur,</HI> saith hee, <HI>Laicos saepissime vocatos ad electionem Ministrorum Ecclesiae, tamen longe est aliud loqui de ordinatione, quam de electione,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Object:</HI> 2: This liberty granted to Congregations prejudg|eth the right of Patrons? <HI>Ans:</HI> 1: If it were so, yet the argu|ment is not pungent in divinity, for why should not humane right give place to divine right? <HI>Nec Episcopale nec patronatus jus Ecclesiasticis Canonibus introductum praejudicare potest potestati jure divino toti Ecclesiae in Ministrorum Electione competenti,</HI> saith <HI>Gerhard Tom:</HI> 6. <HI>Sect:</HI> 114. The states of <HI>Zeeland</HI> did abolish patronages, and give to each Congregation the free Election of their own Minister, which I take to be one cause why Re|ligion flourisheth better there then in any other of the united provinces.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. The Churches liberty of consenting or not con|senting, asserted by the arguments above mentioned, must e|ver be understood to be rationall, so that the Church may not disassent without objecting somewhat against the doctrine or life of the person presented. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. The author of <HI>the histo|rie of Epistopacy part:</HI> 6. <HI>pag:</HI> 362. 364. tells us out of the book of Ordination, that the people are free to except against these that are to be ordained, and are required if they know any crime, for which they ought not to be receaved unto the Mi|nistery, to declare the same. He saith further, that Presby|ters are elected by the Patrons, for and in the name of the rest of the people. pag: 365. So <HI>Peresius de tradit: part:</HI> 3. <HI>pag:</HI> 200. confesseth that people should be required to object what they can against the fitnesse of the man to be ordained. Now then if this be all, that people may object, it is no more then
<PB N="27" REF="22">
Prelats, yea Papists have yeelded. <HI>Answ.</HI> 2. This objection cannot strike against the election of a Pastor, by the judgement and votes of the particular Eldership of that Church where he is to serve: For it is evident by the Scriptures, testimonies, and reasons above specified, not onely that the Church hath liberty of disassenting upon grounds and causes objected, but that the Eldership hath power and liberty positive to elect (by voyces) their Ministers. Now men vote in Elderships, (as in all courts and consistories) freely according to the judgement of their conscience, and are not called to an accompt for a reason of their votes. 3. As the vote of the Eldership is a free vote, so is the Congregations consent, a free consent, and the objection holdeth no more against the latter then against the former, for they are both joyntly required by the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> as appeareth by the citations foresaid. 4. Any man (though not a member of the Congregation) hath place to object against the admission of him that is presented, if hee know such an impediment as may make him uncapable, either at all of the Ministery, or the Ministery of that Church to which he is presented: So that unlesse the Congregation have some|what more then liberty of objecting, they shall have no pri|viledge or liberty, but that which is common to strangers as well as to them. In this fourth answer, I am confirmed by <HI>Blondellus</HI> a man intrusted, and set apart by the nationall Sy|nod of the reformed Churches of <HI>France,</HI> for writing and handli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">g of controversies.

Though nothing be objected against the mans doctrine or life, yet if the people desire ano|ther better or as well qualifyed, by whom they finde them|selves more edified then by the other, that is a reason suffici|ent (i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">a reason must bee given at all) and it is allowed by <HI>Danaeus</HI> in 1. <HI>Tim:</HI> 5. 22. and by the first book of discipline in the fourth head, 6. It being condescended upon in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> that his Majestie with consent and ad|vice of the Estates, should nominate the officers of Estate. The Estates of Parliament were pressed to give a reason of their disassenting from his Majesties nomination, but they refused. And I am sure consenting or not consenting in a matter Eccle|siasticall, ought to be as free, if not more free, then in a matter civill.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4. This course may prove very dangerous for an a|postatizing Congregation, for a people inclining to Heresie or Schisme, will not consent to the admission of an orthodox and sound Minister. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. The intrusion of Ministers against the Congregations will, doth more generally and uni|versally draw after it, great evils and inconveniences, 2. The corruptions of many Patrons, and peradventure also some Presbyteries may be more powerfull to intrude insufficient or unsound Ministers, then the unsoundnesse or errour of this or that particular Congregation, can be to hinder the admission of them that are sound. 3. We shall heartily accord that a he|reticall or a Schismaticall Church, hath not just right to the liberty and priviledge of a sound Church. 4. <HI>Zanchius</HI> in

by that furious <HI>Erastian</HI> who composed the <HI>Gralloe</HI> against <HI>Apollonius</HI> and cryes out that the world is abused with an empty notion of a pretended sacred Ministeriall calling, which may be exercised by none but such as are thereunto called solemnly set a part, and ordained. This is the same thing which hath been formerly debated by Protestant divines against the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> and <HI>Socinians.</HI> See <HI>P.

Peradventure many of the Sectaries of this time will hardly ac|knowledge this much: I shall first of all premise some distin|ctions and considerations for the better opening of the true state and nature of this contravesie. Next I shall bring the positive arguments, and lastly, Answer the contrary objections.</P>
<P>The particulars to be premised are these. First the question is not whether Ordination be the only thing essentiall, or ne|cessary to the right calling of a Minister? I have before plea|ded for the necessity of the Churches consent, I now plead for the necessity of ordination; That ought to be no impediment to this, nor this to that. 2. Neither is the question, whether imposition of hands be essentiall and necessary to the calling of a Minister. Imposition of hands is a rite used in Ordination, after the example of the primitive Churches (of which more anone) but the substance, essence, and formall Act of Ordi|nation is another thing. Therefore not onely the <HI>Lutheran</HI>

Doth also distinguish between the rite or ceremony of laying on of hands, and the essentiall act of Ordination which he rightly calls <HI>missio potestativa,</HI> a sending of one with power and authority: VVhich agreeth well with <HI>Matth.</HI> 10. 1. <HI>Mark</HI> 3. 13, 14, 15. where we have first the election of the Apostles to their office; <HI>He calleth unto him whom he would, and they came uuto him,</HI> Matthew sayeth, <HI>he called unto him his twelve Disciples,</HI> Luke 9. 1. <HI>He called his twelve Disciples together.</HI> Here was an antecedaneous election or designation of the persons. Thereafter followes the ordaining or constituting of them in their office <GAP DESC="foreign"> saith Mark, <HI>and hee ordained</HI> (or <HI>made</HI>) <HI>twelve that they should be with him, and that bee might send them forth to preach, and to have power to heal,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Luke</HI> addeth after the calling together of the twelve, that he gave them <HI>power and authoritie over all devils, and to cure diseases, and he sent them to preach, &amp;c.</HI> VVhich sets forth the true nature and essence of Ordination, that it consists in a sending forth of chosen per|sons with power and authority. And this <HI>potestative missioun</HI> of the twelve is applyed, not onely to power over devils and diseases (which was extraordinary and apostolicall) but to power of preaching which belongeth to the ordinary Pastor to call, charge. Pastors and Teachers are Messengers, <HI>Iob</HI> 33. 23. and God hath committed unto them the word of reconcilia|tion, 2. <HI>Cor:</HI> 5. 19.</P>
<P>3. Neither is the question, what may be done in extraordi|nary cases when Ordination cannot be had, or where there are none who have power to ordaine. VVee read that <HI>Aedesius</HI> and <HI>Frumentius</HI> being but privat men, became Preachers of the
<PB N="35" REF="26">
Gospell, and converted a great nation of the <HI>Indians:</HI> Like|wise that when the <HI>Iberians</HI> were converted by a captive wo|man, their King and Queen became Teachers of the Gospell to the people. There may be an extraordinary calling from God where Religion is not yet planted, nor Churches yet constituted. It is altogether another case in a constituted re|formed or reforming Church: I adde with <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> that even those persons who set about the work of the Ministery extraordinarly or among Infidels, if they can come at any who may ordain them in the usuall and right way, they ought not to neglect the seeking of Ordination.</P>
<P>4. Nor is the question of teaching, exhorting, admonishing, reproving, comforting one another, or praying for, or with one another, in the way of a private Christian fellowship, and and brotherly love. For this belongs to the generall calling of Christians as they are Christians, observing therein the rules of the word, and there is no need nor use of Ordination in all this. But the question is of the particular, speciall, sacred calling of the Ministers of the Gospell to preach and admini|ster the Sacraments, whether Ordination be not essentiall and necessary to this calling. The privat Christian dueties of teaching one another, reproving, exhorting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Are to be conscionably and carefully performed by privat Christians, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4. 28, 29. <HI>Acts</HI> 18. 26. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 19. <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 16. <HI>Heb:</HI> 3. 13. But this the Apostle plainly distinguisheth from the speciall Ministeriall function, 1 <HI>Thess:</HI> 5. 11, 14. with <HI>vers:</HI> 12, 13. The affirmation of this question in hand, <HI>viz.</HI> that Ordination is necessary and essentiall to the calling of a minister, may bee confirmed by these arguments. 1. Doeth not nature it selfe teach you: as the Apostle sayeth in another case, Shall the visible politicall Church of Christ, which is the purest and most perfyt Republick in the world, have lesse order and more confusion in it nor a civill Republick. Embassadours, Com|missioners,
<PB N="36" REF="27">
Officers of State, Judges, Generals, Admirals, with the subordinate Commanders in Armies and Navies, do not runne unsent, nor act without power authority and com|mission given them. How much more unbeseeming, and dis|orderly were it in the Church, (which <HI>Nicolaides</HI> himself, even where he disputeth against the necessity of Ordination, <HI>Refut: tract: de missione minister, cap:</HI> 10. <HI>pag:</HI> 113.) acknowledgeth to be more perfite then any politick Republick in the world) for any man to assume to himselfe power and authority which is not given him, or which he hath <HI>a non habente potestatem,</HI> or to intrude himself into any publick administration unto which he is not appointed. It was justly complained of, as a great dis|order under the Prelates, that Midwives were permitted to baptize upon pretence of a case of necessity, yea that Deacons were permitted to baptize, because the administration of bap|tisme, doeth neither belong to Deacons, nor to private persons. But that railing <HI>Rabshaketh,</HI> the anonymous <HI>Erastian</HI> before men|tioned, goeth so far as to cry down all necessity of Ordination or any speciall call to the Ministery of the Word and Sacra|ments, and alloweth any Christian, whether Magistrate or Subject, both to Preach, Baptize, and minister the Lords Supper, having no Ordination or speciall Mission to that effect. 'Tis a sufficient answer to him, <HI>offer it now unto thy governour, will he be pleased with thee? Mal:</HI> 1. 8. Who will endure such a confusion in a State, that any man may assume publick offi|ces and administrations, not being thereunto called and ap|pointed? And shall the Church (which must go a great deal further than the law and light of nature,) come short of that which nature it self teacheth all humane societies?

How much more were it an intollerable usurpation in the Church, the house of the living God, for any to make themselves stewards of the mysteries of Christ, not being appointed&punc; 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> I argue from, <HI>Rom:</HI> 10. 15. <HI>And how shall they Preach except they be sent?</HI> Suppose they bee well gifted, yet they may not preach except they bee sent and ap|pointed thereunto. This sending must needs bee Ordination, not the Churches Election: a people may choose to themselves, but cannot send to themselves: The choosing of an Embassa|dour is one thing, the sending him, another thing: The Em|bassadour nominated and elected by the King, may not goe to his work and act as an Embassadour, till he bee sent forth with his commission and power delivered to him. There have been severall exceptions made, and more may be made against this argument; yet all of them may bee rationally taken off. Except: 1: The <HI>Socinians</HI> reply, that the Apostle speaketh this of his ownetime when the doctrine of the Gospell was new, and did therefore require a speciall mission: But that now Ministers being to Preach no new doctrine, need not such a spe|ciall call. <HI>Answ.</HI> This is not only, not grounded on the Text, but is contrary both to the metaphore and to the context: 'Tis contrary to the metaphore which the Apostle taketh from the sending of Embassadours, Heraulds, and other publick Mini|sters. These are sent not onely to propound that which was ne|ver before propounded, but also oft times to revive and renew a thing before propounded and known. If either Embassadour, or Herauld run unsent, and goe out without his commission and appointment, it will be no excuse to him, that he hath de|clared no new thing, but what was declared by other Embas|sadoures, or Heraulds before him, for still hee may be chal|lenged as one who runne unsent, and it may bee said to him: <HI>By what authoritie doest thou these things?</HI> 'Tis contrary

Calling upon the name of the Lord. 2. Beleeving on him. 3. Hearing his word. 4. A preaching Ministery. 5. Mission or Ordination. If the first foure be per|petually necessary to the end of the world, so must the fifth be, for the Apostle layeth als great necessity upon this last as upon the rest. If none can be saved who do not pray, and none can pray who do not beleeve, and none can beleeve who doe not hear the word, and none can hear the word without a preach|ing Ministery, the last followeth hard in the Text, there can be no Ministeriall office without a Mission or Ordination. I have before excepted extraordinary cases, where there is yet no Church nor no Ministery: even as the deaf may beleeve who cannot hear, although the Apostle say, <HI>How shall they be|leeve on him of whom they have not heard!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Except.</HI> 2. <HI>Nicolaides</HI> addeth that the Apostle speakes not of what is unlawfull to be, but what is imposible to bee, namely, it is impossible that any man can preach, that is (saith he) declare a new thing except God send him. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. If preaching here in this Text must bee restricted to the preaching of a new thing, hearing must bee also restricted to the hearing of a new thing, and beleeving to the beleeving of a new thing, and so they who do not hear and beleeve some new doctrine, cannot bee saved. 2. It is very possible to preach a new thing, when God hath not sent one to preach it: When the Jesuits first preached their <HI>scientia media,</HI> they preached a new thing, yet God sent them not. 3. Let us consider what the Apostle means here by preachiug <GAP DESC="foreign">, saith hee, 'Tis from <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>praeco, caduceator.</HI> The offices and functions of <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>H.

<P><HI>Except.</HI> 3. That <GAP DESC="foreign"> before cited, in the second part of it <HI>pag:</HI> 3. 4. sayeth that the sending which the Apostles means of, is not a Ministeriall or ecclesiasticall sending, for then none could be an instrument to convert another but a Mi|nister or preacher sent. Neither could a man be sure whether he have faith or no, till he be sure his faith was wrought in him by a Minister lawfully called. It remaines therefore (saith he) <HI>that the Apostle speaks of a providentiall sending, by giving men gifts, and working with them in their use and exercise. Answ.</HI> 1: The giving of gifts and powring out the spirit of a calling, is plainly distinguished from the mission or sending; yea, in Christ himself who had receaved the spirit, not by measure, but above measure, yet his having the Spirit of the Lord upon him, was not his Mission, but is plainly distin|guished from his Mission and Ordination to his office which
<PB N="40" REF="29">
he had from God, <HI>Luke</HI> 4. 18. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospell to the poor, he hath sent me,</HI> &amp;c. The <GAP DESC="foreign"> or ability of gifts to the office is one thing: the <GAP DESC="foreign"> or authority to it, is another thing. 2. His first reason to prove that the Apostle speaks not of a Ministeriall sending, because thence it would follow that none could convert another but a Minister, hee groundeth thus: for 'its said, none can beleeve but by hearing a preacher sent. Now this falls als heavie upon his own Interpretation, for still this will follow, that no man can be converted but a Preacher sent providentially with gifts and assistance, when hee shall loose the knot for himself, he shall loose it for us too. 3. So likewise for his other reason, if the Apostles scope be (as he glosseth) to take away doubting from men, he doeth by his Interpretation split upon the same rocke which he thinks wee have run upon, for a man must still doubt whether hee hath faith or no, and so whether he shall be saved or no, till he be sure his faith was wrought in him by a Preacher sent provi|dentially with working gifts: now the description which hee makes of the providentiall sending, involveth a man in grea|ter doubting then before, for either it agreeth to false and he|reticall Teachers the Ministers of Sathan, or not. If he sayeth it doth agree to them, and that false seducing Preachers (pre|tending to be true, sound, and orthodoxe) are providentially sent with gifts effectuall, <HI>viz.</HI> to deceave in the secret judge|ment of God, according to <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14. 9. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 22. 23. then how he will recon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ile his interpretation with <HI>Isa.</HI> 52. 7. 8. let him see to it. And withall he leads a man upon this opinion, that hee may have faith wrought in him, and so bee saved under any Ministery, true or false, orthodoxe or hereticall. He must also justifie the sinne so often condemned in the false pro|phets, that they run unsent, for (by his principles) they are sent, as well as the true Prophets. If he will say that his des|cription
<PB N="41" REF="29">
of the providentiall sending agreeth not to false or hereticall Preachers, but to the true Ministers of Christ, then hee leads a man into this doubt, that hee cannot bee sure that he beleeves and shall bee saved, unlesse hee bee sure that the Preacher providentially sent to him, is a true Minister of Christ, and not a Minister of Sathan transformed into a Mi|nister of righteousnesse. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 15. <HI>or a wolfe in sheeps cloathing, Matth.</HI> 7. 15. But 4. if this providentiall sending be enough, it takes away the necessity, not onely of Ordina|tion, but of the peoples choosing or consenting. It shall bee enough that God give a man a gift, and work by them, whe|ther the Church consent or not: yet as I take it, he that makes this objection, holds it necessary, not onely that Pastors bee chosen by the Church, but that gifted brethren bee allowed by the Church to prophesie, else that they must not prophe|sie.</P>
<P>5. His objections doth strike against that connexion and con|cat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nation of the means of salvation, which the Apostle hold|eth forth, and there is no more strength in that which he object|eth, then as if one should argue, the deaf may beleeve, therefore faith may be without hearing. Look how hearing is necessary, in the same sence, is Preaching, and the sending of the Preacher necessary, Neither doeth it make any thing against our sence of the Text, that some may be converted, by those who are not Ministers, for tho Preaching of the word by those that are sent to the Ministery of preaching, is the standing Ordinance and ordinary mean of conversion and faith by this Text: and even those who perhaps have been first wroght upon by pray|er or conference with other Christians, are hearers of those who are Ministerially s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nt: it will bee hard to prove that any beleeve, who can hear the word preached by Ministers lawfully called and sent, and doe not hear it.</P>

the <HI>Grallae,</HI> expoundeth (as I remember) this text of an extra|ordinary mission or calling from God, not an ordinary mission from men: denying the Pastors of Churches and Ministers of the Gospel in our dayes to be sent of God and that although the Apostles might shew their Mission and Commission from Christ, yet ordinary Ministers cannot do it: Therefore this sending belongeth not to the ordinary Ministers. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1 This text doth certainly hold forth the necessity of an ordina|ry and mediat Mission, when the extraordinary and immediat Mission is ceased, which I prove this: If a preaching Ministe|ry be a perpetuall and standing ordinance, then Mission is a perpetuall and standing ordinance&punc; But a preaching Ministe|ry is a perpetuall and standing ordinance, therefore so is Mis|sion. The preposition is manifest, both from the kniting together of the parts of this Text, in which the Apostle screw|eth up the necessity of Mission as high as the necessity of preaching: As likewise from <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19. 20. Which doeth not onely prove a perpetuall Ministery in the Church alway even unto the end of the world, but also that this per|petuall Ministery is authorized by Mission or Commission from Christ. For reference to this perpetuall Ministery, Christ saith, Goe, teach and baptize, and loe I am with you alway, e|ven unto the end of the world: So that who ever doeth law|fully exercise the office of teaching and baptising, is certainly sent: he cannot be immediatly and extraordinarly in the re|formed Churches, ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">fore it must be in a mediat and ordina|ry way. The Assumption is before proved.</P>
<P>2. As the preaching so the sending is common to ordinary Ministers with the Apostles. If ordinary Ministers be Preach|ers <HI>ex officio,</HI> as well as the Apostles, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h been before proved, then ordinary Ministers are sent as well as the Apo|stles, for how shall they preach except they be sent, and how shall they be sent in our dayes, except in a mediat and ordinary
<PB N="43" REF="30">
way, by those unto whom the power of Ordination belong|eth?</P>
<P><HI>Except.</HI> 5: But if this Text, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 15. be expounded of Ordination, then expectants or probationaries may not preach, because not yet ordained.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. They neither preach ordinarly, nor <HI>ex officio.</HI> They Preach occasionally, and without a Pastorall or Ministeriall office.</P>
<P>2. Neither may these sonnes of the Prophets runne to such occasionall work, without approbation and licence, for which cause the Directory of worship established in both Kingdoms, puts in this caution, <HI>that such as intend the Ministery, may occasionally both read the Scriptures, and exercise gifts in Preaching in the Congregations, being allowed thereunto by the Presbyterie.</HI> And so the Text will hold true in all cases, extraordinary Preachers, Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets, must have an extraordinary Mission. Ordinary Pastors and Teachers, must have a Mission with power and authority to that effect. Proba|tioners, and occasionall Preachers must have a proportio|nable kinde of Mission, that is, not to the Pastorall office, but to preach upon occasion.</P>
<P>The third argument shall bee taken from that <GAP DESC="foreign"> that constituting, appointing or making of Church officers which is plainly held forth in Scripture. The seven Deacons being elected by the multitude of the Disciples, were appointed, set and constituted over that businesse by the Apostles, <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 3. Pastors and Teachers have much more need to be appointed to their office, and for them let us note two Scriptures, one is <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 42. <HI>Who then is that faithfull and wise steward, whom his Lord shall make</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign">] <HI>ruler over his houshold, to give them their portion of meat in dew season? Grotius</HI> upon the place not|eth, that the former parable concerning watching is intended for all Christians, so <HI>Mark.</HI> 13. 37. but this of stewards be|longs
<PB N="44" REF="31">
to the Pastors of Churches, for 'its upon occasion of <HI>Pe|ters</HI> question concerning the former parable, <HI>(Lord speakest thou this parable unto us, or even unto all?)</HI> Christ answeres by this parable of stewards, appointed or ordained over the houshold, whom he distinguisheth from other servants by their ruleing power, <HI>verse&punc;</HI> 42. by their greater knowledge, and consequent|ly greater guiltinesse, if wicked, <HI>vers.</HI> 47. and by the greater trust committed to them, <HI>vers.</HI> 48. Now least it should bee thought, that this making or appointing of stewards over the houshold of Christ, is onely meant of the Apostles, as it were of purpose to discover the vanity of that <HI>Socinian</HI> error, 'tis said, <HI>vers.</HI> 43. <HI>Blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he com|meth shall finde so doing.</HI> Till Christ come again, and at his comming, there shall be stewards appointed and set over his house: Which cannot be without the mediate and ordinary way of making, appointing, and ordaining. The Bishops or Elders, as well as Apostles <HI>are</HI> the stewards of God, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 7. And so I come to the other Scripture concerning those teaching and ruleing officers. The Apostle left <HI>Titus</HI> at <HI>Crete</HI> that he might ordain Elders in every city, <HI>vers.</HI> 5. The <GAP DESC="foreign"> mentioned in the beginning, replyeth to this Text, that <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>signifie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h to fixe, settle, establish one who was in office before as ap|pears by Psal&punc;</HI> 2. 6. See now with how little reason this man op|pugneth the receaved principles. The <HI>Septuagint</HI> (sayeth he) readeth <HI>Psal:</HI> 2. 6. thus <GAP DESC="foreign">, but <HI>David</HI> was a King many years before he took in the hill and fort of Zion. I shall not stand here upon this erroneous transcribing of the words of the <HI>Septuagints: I</HI> might tell him again that <HI>Sym|machus</HI> readeth <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>I have an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">inted my King,</HI> having respect to the very first making him King, and this is the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rest rendering of the Originall. But I will stand to that of the <HI>Septuagints:</HI> even their reading (without the least vio|lence to their words) may be understood, not of the setling of
<PB N="45" REF="31">
<HI>David</HI> after he took in the fort of Zion, but of Gods appoint|ing and ordaining him to rule in, upon, or over Zion, which I doe not doubt was their meaning, neither doeth the prepo|sitions <GAP DESC="foreign"> at all hinder, but help this Interpretation of the <HI>Sep|tuagint.</HI> See the like <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. 21. <GAP DESC="foreign">, This is not the fixing and setling of that good servant in that ruleing power, but 'tis the first giving of it to him, the first making him ruler over many things, having before had but a few things, <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 44. <GAP DESC="foreign"> So <HI>Isocrates,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. I may confu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e him from the <HI>Sep|tuagint</HI> themselves, Psal. 8. 6. <GAP DESC="foreign"> Dan. 1. 11: <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Will hee say that the <HI>Septuagint</HI> meant that God setled and fixed the dominion which man had before over the creatures, or that the Prince of the Eunuches did but settle and fixe that government which <HI>Melzar</HI> had be|fore over <HI>Daniel?</HI> If they meane in those places <HI>constituting</HI> and appoynting (as it is most manifest they doe) why not also <HI>Psal.</HI> 2. 6? God appointed <HI>David</HI> to be a King upon the holy hill of Zion, which is all that can be made out of the <HI>Septua|gint.</HI> Well, but I will goe yet further with him, to discover the futility of his exception: 'Tis true <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <GAP DESC="foreign"> is sometime used for restoring and setling that which is out of 'its course, but how did he imagine that this sence of the word could agree to <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 5? Thought hee that <HI>Titus</HI> was left in <HI>Crete,</HI> for restoring, setling, and fixing those Elders who had left their station, or had been cast out, or persecuted, or the like? Doeth not the Apostle plainly speak of supplying and making up such things as were yet wanting to those Churches, and of ordaining Elders to Churches which wanted Elders. Wherefore the ordinary reading and interpretation is retained <GAP DESC="foreign"> is to be understood of making, or ordaining Elders, even as <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <GAP DESC="foreign"> and the like, <HI>constituere, praeficere,</HI> to make or appoint rulers and
<PB N="46" REF="32">
judges, by giving them power and authority to rule or judge. So <HI>Asts.</HI> 7. 10. <GAP DESC="foreign">, which was not a setling and fixing of <HI>Ioseph;</HI> in the government of Egypt, as if he had been governour of it before, for that was the first time he was made governour.</P>
<P>The fourth argument is taken from <HI>Heb.</HI> 5. 4. <HI>And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron. If yee would know what this calling was, see</HI> vers. 1. Hee was <HI>taken from among men, and ordained for men, in things pertain|ing to God.</HI> The <HI>Socinian</HI> exception against our arguments, from the example and practice of Ordination in the Apostles times, (namely that there is no such necessity of ordaining those who are to teach Doctrines formerly delivered, and receaved, as there was, for ordaining those who bring a new Doctrine) can|not here help them; yea, is hereby confuted, for none of the Priests under the law, no not the high Priest, might teach or pronounce any other thing, but according to the Law and the Testimony, <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. 11. <HI>Mal.</HI> 2. 7. Yet the Priests were ordained to their office, and might not without such Ordina|tion enter into it. And this was no typicall thing proper to the old Testament, but hath a standing reason. The <HI>Socinians</HI> therefore have another evasion from the words, <HI>this honour</HI> re|stricting the Apostles meaning, to that honour of the Priest|hood onely. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. The words <GAP DESC="foreign"> need not to be un|derstood demonstratively, or <HI>signanter,</HI> but indefinitly, <GAP DESC="foreign"> with the prepositive Article, and so both the <HI>Syriak</HI> Interpre|ter: <HI>Hierome, Arias Montanus,</HI> and the <HI>Tigurin</HI> version r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ad it indefinitly, <HI>honorem,</HI> not <HI>hunc honorem, No man taketh honour unto himself, but he,</HI> &amp;c. See the very same words in the same sence, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>honour to whom honour,</HI> not <HI>this honour.</HI> So <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Revel.</HI> 21. 26. is not rendered, <HI>this honour.</HI> 2. Suppose it bee meant <HI>signanter,</HI> yet our argu|ment is valid.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="32">Although the Apostle give instance only in the high Priest|hood, yet by analogie of reason, the <HI>Axiome</HI> will hold in re|ference to the Ministery of the new Testament, upon which God hath put so much honour, that it is called a worthie work, 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 3. 1. and worthie of double honour. 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 5. 17. and to be esteemed very highly, 1 <HI>Thess:</HI> 5. 17. The Ministers of the Gospell are the Embassadours of Christ, 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 5. 20. and the Angels of the Churches, the starres in Christs right hand, <HI>Revel:</HI> 1. 20. &amp; 2, 1. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yea, the glory of Christ, 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 8. 23.

Then 'its not onely as great, but a greater usurpation, for a man to take this honour of the Evangelicall Ministery to him|self, then it had been of old, for a man to take that honour of the legall high Priest-hood to himself.</P>
<P>The fifth argument I draw from <HI>Heb:</HI> 6. 1. 2. Where wee have an enumeration of the generall Catecheticall heads, which was necessarly required in Catechumens, before they were baptized and receaved as Church Members, and where there was yet no Church planted, these heads were taught, learned, and professed, before there could be a visible politicall Mini|steriall Church erected, that the Apostles sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aks to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> as visible Ministeriall Churches is manifest, both from the particulars here enumerat, and fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m Chap. 5. 12. 13. &amp; 13. 7. 17. Now he exhorteth them to goe on unto perfection, and not to be ever about the laying of foundations, or about the learning of these Catecheticall principles, the knowledge and profession, whereof did first give them an enterance, state, and standing in the visible Church of Christ, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. The foundation of repentance, <HI>i. e.</HI> Conviction and knowledge of sinne by the law, humiliation and sorrow for it, with a desire of freedome for it. 2. The foundation of faith
<PB N="48" REF="33">
in Christ for our wisdome, righteousnesse, sanctification and redemption. 3. The foundations of Baptisme, <HI>i. e.</HI> The abolishing of these diverse legall washings, <HI>Hel.</HI> 9. 10. and the ordinance of the Christian baptisme for sealing the Cove|nant of grace, and for initiation in Church membership: O|thers say he speaks in the plurall, because in those times many were baptized at once usually. 4. The foundation of laying on of hands, that is (saith <HI>Bullinger</HI> on the place) of the Mini|stery, and of their Vocation, Mission, and authority given them. So also <HI>Gualther</HI> in his <HI>Archetypes</HI> upon the place, <HI>Tossanus</HI> pointeth at the same thing, as principally intended in the Text, Which agreeth well with that which diverse Divines make one of the marks of a true visible Church, namely, a Ministery lawfully called and ordained, and professed subjection there|unto. 5. The foundation of the resurrection from the dead. 6. The soundation of the last judgement, in which Christ shall adjudge the righteous to life everlasting, and the wicked to everlasting punishment, <HI>Matth</HI> 25. <HI>ult.</HI></P>
<P>That which hath obscured and cast a mist upon this Text, was the Popish and prelaticall confirmation, or Bishopping of children, which they grounded upon this same Scripture. And this way goe the Popish interpreters, expounding it of their Sacrament of confirmation: Others understand the gifts of the holy Ghost, which in those dayes were given by laying on of hands. But it hath never been, nor can never bee proved, either that hands were layd upon all baptized Christians who were growen up to yeares of knowledge in these Apostolicall times, or that the gifts of the holy Ghost were given with e|very laying on of hands in those times. For the laying on of hands, (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 14. and 5. 22.) was not for giving the holy Ghost, but for Ordination. Wherefore I conceave that the laying on of hands, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 2. Pointeth at the Ministery, and their Ordination, which was accompanied with that rite.
<PB N="49" REF="33">
Many interpreters who extend the Text further, doe not yet acknowledge that the Ordination of Ministers is a thing intended by the Apostle. Which is the more probable, if you read <GAP DESC="foreign"> dividedly with a comma betwixt, which <HI>Erasmus</HI> inclineth most unto, following the Greek <HI>Scholiasts.</HI> So the <HI>Tigurin</HI> version, <HI>baptismatum, doctrinae, ac impositionis manum.</HI> So you shall finde seven of these cateche|ticall principals, and after baptisme, adde Doctrine, that is, a preaching or teaching Ministery, and then the next head con|taines the necessity of a speciall calling and Ordination to this Ministery. However read it conjunctly or dividedly, it makes a true and good sence to expound, laying on of hands (here) of the ordinance of a preaching Ministery lawfully called and or|dained, for this ordinance and a professed subjection thereun|to, may justly be reckoned among the catecheticall points, and among the marks of a true visible Ministeriall Church. Where|as it were a dangerous and unsafe interpretation, and I beleeve that which cannot be made out, to say, that any of the cate|cheticall heads enumerate by the Apostle, was proper to that primitive age, and doeth not concerne after ages: or yet to affirme that the giving of the holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, was extended to all Catechumens baptized in those times, or that the knowledge or profession of the Doctrine concerning the giving of the gifts of the holy Ghost, by such laying on of hands was s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ch a principle, as that none ignorant thereof, though insttucted in all the other Articles of Chri|stian faith, could be receaved as a Church-member grounded in catecheticall points.</P>
<P>I shall adde a sixth argument from the example and practise of the Apostles and others who did ordaine Church officers in their dayes, the example is binding in such things as were not onely lawfull and good, but have a standing and perpetuall reason. The seven Deacons were ordained with prayer and
<PB N="50" REF="34">
laying on of hands, <HI>Act:</HI> 6. 3. 6. Elders were ordained in every city, <HI>Tit:</HI> 1. 5. although those Elders were not to preach any new Gospel, <HI>Gal:</HI> 1. 8. <HI>Paul</HI> warneth <HI>Timothy,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 22. <HI>lay hands suddenly on no man. i. e.</HI> be not rash in ordaining any to the work of the Ministery, let them be well examined and ap|proved. This is the receaved sence of Interpreters following <HI>Chrysostome, Ambrose, Hierome,</HI> and others of the Fathers, yet <HI>Nicolaides Refut. tract. de missione Ministr&punc;</HI> will have the Text understood, not of ordaining Ministers, but of admitting pe|nitents, which was done with imposition of hands. But is this to expound Scripture by Scripture? or is it not rather to forsake an Interpretation confirmed by Scripture, and to follow one which is grounded upon no Scripture? For wee read nothing in Scripture of laying on of hands in the recea|ving or restoring of penitents. Of the laying on of hands in Or|dination, wee doe read in Scripture, and least it should bee thought the act of one man onely, it is mentioned as the act of the Presbyterie, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 14. <HI>with the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie.</HI> A place which <HI>Gualt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">er, Bullinger, Tossanus</HI> and diverse other good Interpreters thinke to hold forth the way which <HI>Paul</HI> would have observed in the calling and ap|pointing of men to the Ministery: Some understand by <GAP DESC="foreign">, the office it self&punc; dignity or degree of an Elder which was given to <HI>Timothy</HI> by the laying on of hands: Others under|stand a company of Bishops who were Elders and more too: I confesse it doth not; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hers an Assembly of Elders, without any prelaticall disparity. Now neither o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> these Interpre|tations can strike against that point which now I plead for, <HI>viz.</HI> The point of Ordination, but rather make much for it, yea even they who understand the office of a Presbyter, doe thereby confirme that which I assert in as much as <HI>Timothy</HI> was not made an Elder, but by imposition of hands, as these hold. If so, then certainly Ordination is essentiall to the calling of
<PB N="51" REF="34">
a Presbyter. So that what ever come of the word <HI>Presbytery,</HI> the laying on of hands which made the Presbyter, will con|clude against them who deny the necessity of Ordination.</P>
<P>The seventh argument shall bee drawn from the denomina|tions of the Ministers of the Gospell in Scripture. 1. They are called Pastors or Shepheards, <HI>Ier:</HI> 3. 15. <HI>Eph:</HI> 4. 11. Hee that is not called and appointed by the Lord of the flocke, he that entereth not by the doore, but breaks in surreptitiously, and makes himselfe sheepherd at his own hand, is not a sheep|herd but a thief, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 10. 9. 10. Next they are Angels or mes|sengers, <HI>Mat:</HI> 23. 24. <HI>Rev:</HI> 1. 20: and 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 8. 23. with 2. 1. and the Embassadours of Christ, 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 5. 20. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 20. Therefore they are sent and appointed, and do not run unsen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</P>
<P>3. They are called <HI>Rulers,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 17. <GAP DESC="foreign">, 1 <HI>Thess:</HI> 5. 12. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Heb:</HI> 13. 7. 17. do men make themselves Rullers, Magistrates, Captains at their owne hand, or are they not thereunto appointed by others?</P>
<P>4. They are called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ishops, or overseers, <HI>Act.</HI> 20. 28. 1 <HI>Tim&punc;</HI> 3. 1. The <HI>Athenians</HI> give the name <GAP DESC="foreign"> to one whom they appointed, ordained, and sent forth to be Magistrate or Praetor in any of the Townes, subject to their jurisdiction. See <HI>H. Steph. thes: ling. Gr:</HI> in the word <GAP DESC="foreign"></P>
<P>5. They are <GAP DESC="foreign"> stewards, <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 42. 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 4. 1 <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 7. Who dare make himself a steward in a Kings house; yea, or in a more private house, not being thereunto appointed and ordained?</P>
<P>6. They are servants who invite and call in guests to the wed|ing, to the marriage supper, <HI>Mat:</HI> 22. 3. <HI>Luke</HI> 14. 17. Will any (except a fool, or a knave,) go and invite guests to a mans Table, when he is not sent nor appointed:</P>
<P>7. They are <GAP DESC="foreign">, Preachers, Heraulds, 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 2. 7. and 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 1. 11. Will a Herauld go and proclaime the Kings Edicts, or the ordinances of Parliament, if hee be not thereunto ap|pointed?
<PB N="52" REF="35">
In both these Texts last cited, the Apostle speak|ing of the Gospell, sayeth, <HI>Whereunto I am ordained a Preacher, and an Apostle, and a Teacher of the Gentiles.</HI> Mark, hee is or|dained not an Apostle, but a Preacher, as hee could not bee an Apostle without Ordination, so he could not bee so much as <GAP DESC="foreign"> a Preacher without Ordination. Now ordinary Pa|stors are <GAP DESC="foreign"> as well as the Apostles which hath been before shewed.</P>
<P>An eight argument I collect from 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 2. 2. <HI>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithfull men, who shall be able to teach others also.</HI> Which is a most considerable place against the <HI>Socinians, Ana|baptists, &amp;c.</HI> For it Teacheth us these five particulars. 1: That the Apostles would not have a teaching or preaching Ministery to end with that time, but was carefull to have Pastors or Teachers provided for the succeeding generation also. 2. <HI>Thes:</HI> Teachers of others who were to labour in the word and do|ctrine, were to teach no new doctrine, but the very same things which they receaved from <HI>Timothy,</HI> and <HI>Timothy</HI> from <HI>Paul,</HI> and which <HI>Paul</HI> receaved from the LORD. It was in sence no new doctrine, when it is taught by <HI>Paul,</HI> much lesse when taught by <HI>Timothy,</HI> and least of all when taught by these who receaved it from <HI>Timothie.</HI> So that the <HI>Socinian</HI> distinction of the necessity of a speciall calling to the Ministery when the doctrine is new, not so when the doctrine is not new, cannot here help them. 3. <HI>Thes:</HI> Teachers are distinguished from those who are taught: Every man may not be a Teacher. It is a peculiar and particular calling, and it is no part of the ge|nerall calling of Christians: Therefore both here, and <HI>Gal:</HI> 6. 6. there is such a distinction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n the Church, some are Teach|ers, some are taught in the Word. 4. Fitnesse and abilities; yea, both grace and gifts together, cannot warrant a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n to assume to himself the function of Teaching or Preaching to
<PB N="53" REF="35">
others, except he be thereunto allowed, and appointed, and entrusted. The Apostle sayeth not, <HI>the things that thou heard of me, the same I will that faithfull and able men, who ever shall be willing to the work, teach others also,</HI> faithfulnesse, and fitnesse, or ability cannot make a sufficient calling, but qualifie a man for that which he shall be called unto. Aptitude is one thing: to be cloathed with a calling, power and authority is another thing. 5. There is more that belongs to the calling of Pastors and Teachers, than the Churches electing, or choosing of them: for those unto whom the power of Ordination belongeth, do also <HI>commit</HI> unto them that which they are entrusted with, <HI>the same commit thou,</HI> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="foreign">. 'Tis from <GAP DESC="foreign">, which (as <HI>H: Stephanus</HI> in <HI>Thes: ling: Gr:</HI> tom. 3. pag 1505. noteth) not seldome in the new Testament doeth signifie, <HI>depositum alicu|jus fidei committere, fiduciarium tradere alicut,</HI> where he citeth this very Text, and I shall clear it yet further from <HI>Luke:</HI> 12. 48. <HI>and unto whom men have commited much</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>of him they will ask the more,</HI> which is the conclusion of the parable concerning a faithfull and wise steward, appointed by his Lord to be ruler over his houshold; to give them their portion of meat in due season, and that Parable is meant of Pastors or Ministers lawfully called and sent, as hath been before cleared.</P>
<P>Ninthly, as we are obleidged by our Covenant to endea|vour such a Reformation, as is most agreeable to the word of God, and the Example of the best reformed Churches, so in this particular of Ordination, and a speciall call and setting a|part of men to the Ministery, we have not onely the example of the ancient and reformed Churches, but the word of God it selfe directeth us this way. 1. Before the law when the first borne in families (not all promiscuously) acted the part of Priests or publick Ministers. Whereof there are some ex|presse examples in <HI>Enoch</HI> a Prophet, <HI>Gen.</HI> 5. 24. <HI>Iude Epistle,</HI> vers. 14. <HI>Noah, Heb:</HI> 11. 7. by whom God preached to the
<PB N="54" REF="36">
old world, 2 <HI>Pet:</HI> 2. 5. and so are we to understand <HI>Gen:</HI> 6. 3: <HI>Abraham</HI> a Prophet, <HI>Gen:</HI> 20. 7. <HI>Melchisedeck</HI> the Priest of the most high GOD, is thought by many learned men (follow|ing both <HI>Ionathans</HI> Targum, and that of <HI>Ierusalem</HI>) to have been <HI>Shem,</HI> the first born of <HI>Noah:</HI> of <HI>Iacob</HI> also (who got the birth-right from <HI>Esau</HI>) we read that he built Altars, and cal|led, upon the name of the Lord, and he was a Prophet, <HI>Gen:</HI> 49. And it is often mentioned by <HI>Moses,</HI> that the sons of <HI>Aaron</HI> were taken in stead of the first borne. 2. Under the Law, when not onely the Prophets, but the Priests also who were ordinary Ministers, had a speciall Ordination to their office. 3.

<HEAD>CHAP. IIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Objections against the necessity of Ordination answered.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I Come now to answere the strongest objections of those who hold Ordination not necessary, nor essen|tiall to the calling of a Minister.</P>
<P><HI>Obejct.</HI> 1. From <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 4. <HI>They that were scattered abroad, went every where preaching the Word.</HI> So <HI>Acts</HI> 11. 19. <HI>Apollos</HI> also taught boldly in the Synagogues, <HI>Acts</HI> 18. 25, 26. yet no word of their Mission or Ordination. The Jews esteem|ed Christ himself but a private man, not ordained nor autho|rized to any office in the Church, yet they permitted him to preach in their Synagogues. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. Those that after <HI>Ste|phens</HI> death, were scattered abroad, and preached the Word, must needs have been called, sent, and ordained (by the prin|ciples of the <HI>Socinians</HI> themselves,) for the Doctrine which they preached, was a new Doctrine, both to <HI>Samaria, Acts</HI> 8. 5. and to those dispersed Jews, <HI>Acts</HI> 11. 19. Themselves con|fesse, that they who preach a new Doctrine, must have a spe|ciall Mission and Ordination. 2. <HI>Philip</HI> was one of those who went abroad preaching the Word, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 45. Now hee is expressely called an Evangelist, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 8. therefore no presi|dent for private Christians to preach. 3. It is a bad argument <HI>Luke</HI> mentioneth, not their Ordination, therefore they were not orda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ned. They may aswell argue thus. <HI>Luke</HI> mentioneth
<PB N="56" REF="37">
not that they prayed when they preached, therefore they did not pray when they preached. Or thus: The Scripture mentio|neth not <HI>Ioabs</HI> father, but onely his mother <HI>Zerviah,</HI> therefore he had not a father. 4. And suppose they preached the Word without Mission or Ordination, this is but like that which <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> lib: <HI>ad eos qui scandalisati sunt,</HI> cap: 19. recordeth as a marvelous extraordinary benefit, which did accrew from the bloody persecutions of those ancient times, <HI>viz.</HI> That in such times, the sheep acted the parts of shepheards, being driven away to deserts and mountains, where (by the Spirit of God speaking in them) they converted unbeleevers, and gathered Churches: Which concludeth nothing against the necessity of Ordination, in constituted and reformed Churches, for they who were scattered abroad, being driven away in the heat of persecution, might not have the opportunity of Ordination, and they went forth to gather Christians to plant Churches, to lay foundations where Christ was not known. Such cases were in the beginning excepted from the sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e of our present question. 5. If <HI>Apollos</HI> preached without Ordination, when he knew onely the baptisme of <HI>Iohn,</HI> and withall when he had to do with those Jews, who were yet to be convinced that Je|sus was the Christ, <HI>Acts</HI> 18. 25, 26, 28. It is no good argu|ment against the necessity of Ordination, where the doctrine of Christ is known and receaved, and Churches constituted. And withall how will it be proved, that <HI>Apollos</HI> having been one of <HI>Iohns</HI> Disciples, had not some commission from <HI>Iohn</HI> to preach the Word? Or if <HI>Apollos</HI> was but a gifted brother without any publick calling or authority in the Church, how came he to be so much esteemed, as to be compared with <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 1. 12. Lastly as touching Christs preaching in the Synagogues, hee was lookt upon as a Prophet extraor|dinarly r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ised up in Israel. <HI>Luke</HI> 4 15. 16, 24. and the Jews say of him plainly, a great Prophet is risen up among us
<PB N="57" REF="37">
<HI>Luke</HI> 7. 16. <HI>Iosephus</HI> his testimony given to Christ, as a great Prophet, is known.</P>
<P><HI>Object:</HI> 2. The Church doeth <GAP DESC="foreign">, by their voices in Election, make, creat, constitute or ordain Elders, <HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23. therefore Elders need no other Ordination, but are sufficiently ordained or made by the Church, if elected, and receave their power from the people See this Objection prosecuted in the <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>pag:</HI> 9. 10. 11. And in the Queries touching Ordinati|on, <HI>pag:</HI> 33. <HI>tom:</HI> 37. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. There is no cogent reason brought by these men, why <GAP DESC="foreign">, if rendered thus as they would have it, <HI>when they had by voices ordained,</HI> must bee therefore understood of Ordination by the people, and not by <HI>Paul:</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> for as I have before noted out of <HI>Calv&igrave;n: Instit.</HI> lib: 4. cap: 3. &sect;. 15. The sence may bee this, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> did make and ordain Elders according to the voices of the Church|es themselves, that is, they ordained such as the Church desi|red. If so, they are double loosers by this their Objection. 2. If <GAP DESC="foreign"> be meant of the Churches Act, then it is not ordaining, but choosing by voices. The <GAP DESC="foreign"> ought not to hinder the <GAP DESC="foreign">. Election with the Churches consent, and Ordination are both of them necessary, not inconsistent. In <HI>Athens</HI> it self, although the people did <GAP DESC="foreign"> choose by voyces their Magistrates or Rulers, yet the persons so elected were not ordained, and solemnly set apart, appointed and au|thorized by the people, but by the Judges called <GAP DESC="foreign"> of whom <HI>Dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sthenes orat. advers: Timo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r:</HI> tels us that they did <GAP DESC="foreign">, for the <GAP DESC="foreign">, took an oath to be faithfull in their consti|tuting or ordaining of Mag strates. 3. In Scripture we finde Election and Ordination frequently distinguished, not only as distinct acts, but oft times in distinct hands, <HI>Deut.</HI> 1. 13. <HI>Moses</HI> said unto all Israel, <HI>Take yee wise men and understanding, and known among your Tribes, and I will make them Rulers over you.</HI> The people choose them who shall be Rulers, but <HI>Moses</HI> maks
<PB N="58" REF="38">
them Rulers, <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 3. <HI>Wherefore brethren look yee out among you seven men of honest report, full of the holy Ghost and wisdome, whom we may appoint over this businesse.</HI> The people choose, the Apostles appoint the Deacons. 4 The choosing of a person to an office, is not the authorizing of the person elected, but the designation of the person to be authorized. 'Tis here with a person chosen, as with a thing chosen: <HI>Ezra</HI> was to choose, and to designe, when, and how much silver, wheat, wine, oyle, should be taken for the House of the Lord, not exceeding the proportion of a hundreth, but the power and authority by which these things were given forth by the Thesaurers, to be applyed to such uses, was from the decree of <HI>Artaxerxes, Ezra.</HI> 7. 21, 22. So <HI>Ester</HI> choosed what to make request for, but the thing was to be performed by authority of the King, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> 5. 3, 6. So a man may be chosen to an office by some, and authorized to act in that office by others. How many subor|dinat offices, (civill and military) are there, in which men act by the power and authority, derived from the ordinances of Parliament, although not nominated and chosen by the Par|liament; but by others, intrusted by the Parliament to choose. 5. Even where Election and Mission, are in the same hands, yet they are not confounded, but are lookt upon as two dis|tinct acts: Christ first choosed the twelve, and pitched upon such as he would, and then ordained them, and sent them forth, <HI>Mark:</HI> 3. 13. 14. The Synod of the Apostles and Elders first choosed, then sent <HI>Iudas</HI> and <HI>Silas, Acts</HI> 15. 22, 25. Where you may observe also by the way, that the Mis|sion of a man to the Ministery, or Pastorall charge of a Con|gregation, doeth not belong to the people who choose him, they cannot send him to themselves. When Election and Mission are in the same hands, 'tis in such cases as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">se two last cited, when men are sent abroad to others, then indeed they who choose them, may also send them: but when they are sent to
<PB N="59" REF="38">
those who choose them, then they are sent by others, a Mini|ster is sent to the Congregation, therefore he is not sent by the Congregation, and so that place, <HI>Rom:</HI> 10. 15. <HI>How shall they preach except they be sent?</HI> cannot be understood of the peoples Election, but of Ordination, or Mission from the Presbytery appointed to ordain. 6. The same Apostolicall Patterne which holds forth unto us the choosing of Elders in every Church, <HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23. doeth also hold forth unto us the ordaining of Elders in every City, <HI>Tit:</HI> 1. 5. and these acts in different hands, therefore not the same; yea, as many conceave in that same Text, <HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23. beside the Election by voyces, th re is a distinct Ordination expressed under the adjuncts thereof, prayer, and fasting.</P>
<P><HI>Object:</HI> 3. The Apostle saith, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 26. <HI>When yee come together every one of you hath a Psalme, hath a Doctrine, hath a Tongue, hath a Revelation, hath an Interpretation,</HI> vers 13. <HI>yee may all prophesie one by one.</HI> Therefore all that preach or pro|ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sie, need not to be ordain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d <HI>Answ:</HI> What those Pro|phets were, and what is meant by prophesying there, all are not of one opinion.

But of this I am to speak distinctly, and by it selfe afterwards. Mean while, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y that make the Objection, must prove two things, else they conclude nothing against the ne|cessitie of Ordination. 1. That these Prophets were not sent and ordained, but that their gifts and parts, gave them a suf|ficient calling to interpret in the Church. 2. That although they had no Ministeriall sending, or vocation, yet they were not extraordinary Prophets, but that such Prophets are to continue ordinarly in the Church, I beleeve it will trouble them to prove either.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="39">
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4. 'Tis said of the house of <HI>Stephanus,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 16. 15. <HI>They have addicted</HI> (or <HI>ordained) themselves to the Ministerie of the Saints,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. They were not or|dained by others, but they ordained themselves. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1: This may well be understood (as 'tis by diverse) of their devoting themselves to Minister to the necessities of the Saints, by their works and labour of Love. Which is else where called, <HI>Ministering to the Saints,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 8. 4.

Where <GAP DESC="foreign"> alone is used in the same sence. 2. Others give this sence, that they did willinglie and zealously desire to do service to Christ in the Ministery of the Gospell, according as they should finde a calling. In which sence, <HI>if a man desire the office of a Bishop, he desireth a good work,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 3. 1. So <HI>Isa:</HI> 6. 8. <HI>Here am I, send me.</HI> He is very willing to the work, yet hee dare not runne, except he bee sent, and get a commis|sion.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 5. He that digged in the earth, and hid his talent, is condemned for it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. 25. 30. Therefore he that hath gifts for preaching, and administering the Sacraments, cannot answere it to God, except he improve and use those gifts. <HI>Ans.</HI> 1. If that Parable be applyed to Ministeriall talents, then it will prove, not onely a perpetuall Ministery, because the Lord saith to his servants, <HI>Occupie till I come, Luke:</HI> 19. 13. But like|wise, that none ought to intrude themselves into that holy function, except they have a calling as well as gifts, for <HI>Mat:</HI> 25. 14, 15. that Lord <HI>called his owne servants</HI> (<HI>Luke</HI> saith, hee <HI>called his ten servants</HI>) <HI>and delivered unto them his goods: and un|to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to everie one according to his severall abilitie:</HI> Where wee have a distinction of the calling and ability, suppose another man had been able enough, yet if he bee none of the called ones,
<PB N="61" REF="39">
that Parable cannot be applyed to him. 2. This Objection may be made in the behalfe of women also; many of whom receave excellent gifts from God, yea, it was foretold by <HI>Ioel,</HI> and applyed by <HI>Peter:</HI> that women as well as men should Prophesie, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 7. 8. Which being misunderstood, gave some colour to the old <HI>Pepuzian</HI> Heresie.</P>
<P><HI>Object:</HI> 6. If we hold Ordination necessary, and essentiall to the calling of a Minister, wee bring our selves into this snare, that either the Ministers in the reformed Churches, are not true Ministers, but falsely pretended to be so, or otherwise we must hold that those in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> from whom the Protestant Ministers, in the beginning of the Reformation, had their Ordination, were true Ministers of Christ. For if those in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> who did ordaine, were not true Ministers of Christ, then they had no commission from Christ to make Ministers for him. And who can bring a clean thing out of that which is unclean: If so, then the Protestant Mi|nisters, who first ordained other Protestant Ministers (from whom Ordination hath come to us downwards) having no Ordination, but what they receaved in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> they had not power to ordain others with such an Ordination, as hath a divine stamp and character upon it.</P>
<P>This argument is much insisted upon by the Author of the Queries touching Ordination: If it can do any thing, yet it is no new light, but the very same which hath been formerlie objected by Papists, and answered by Protestant writers. Whereof see one instance in <HI>Gerhard,</HI> loc: com: tom: 6. <HI>de Minist: Eccles:</HI> &sect; 157.</P>
<P>And now that those who drive so furiouslie after this Po|pish argument, may forever be ashamed of it: I returne these answeres. 1. By retortion, the argument will conclude as much against the Baptisme, and Church estate of <HI>Independents, Anabaptists,</HI> and who ever they bee that make any use of this
<PB N="62" REF="40">
way of arguing against us. For by this argument, those who first gathered their Churches, bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ized, and incorporated them into the body of Christ, were not only no true Ministers, but no true Church-members, having no other baptisme, but what was receaved, either in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> or from those who were baptized in the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> But who can bring a clean thing, out of that which is unclean. Where note by the way, that this argument of theirs, will also make the Scripture it self unclean now, because we have it out of an unclean thing, (the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>): So that all that will stand to this argument, must unchurch, unbaptize, unchristen themselves: If they will have their recourse to that promise, <HI>where two or three are met together, there am I in the midst of them,</HI> and think to lay the foundation of their Churches there, with|out any derivation from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> they must allow us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o so too, but then they must passe from their argument. What will they say then? Either, there can bee in our dayes atr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e Church with all the ordinances of Christ in it, indepen|dent upon the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and without building or lean|ing upon a lineall succession, or derivation from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> or there cannot. If they hold the affirmative, their argument is not worth a straw, for Ordination being one of the ordinances of Christ (which is here to be supposed, and hath been in the precedent Chapter proved) the reformed Churches had power to set it up, and restore it by vertue of Christs own institution. If the Negative, our Opposits, must all turne <HI>Seekers,</HI> their Churches are no Churches, their Baptisme no Baptisme, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2. Suppose those protestant Ministers, who first ordained other Ministers, were themselves ordained by such as had no power to ordain them. Nay sup|pose the first reforming Ministers, to have been at the begin|ning of the Reformation, no Ministers, but private Persons, not pretending to be ordained. What will they conclud from
<PB N="63" REF="40">
this? It proves nothing against that which wee hold concer|ning the necessity of Ordination: For we plainly say, that in extraordinary cases when Ordination cannot be had, and when there are none who have commission and authority from Christ to ordain, then, and there, an inward call from God en|larging the heart, stirring up, and assisting with the good will and consent of a people whom God makes willing, can make a Minister authorized to Ministeriall acts. Suppose this to have been the case at the first comming out from Popery, yet here was a seed for more Churches, and more Ministers. At the first plantation of Churches, Ordination may bee wanting without making void the Ministery, because Ordination can|not be had, but in constituted Churches, the want of Ordi|nation doth make a Minister no Minister. 3. Touching the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> I answer as a learned country man of mine answered nere 70. yeares agoe. Although it was a Church miserably corrupted and defaced, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t it was even then a Church, wherein he professeth to follow <HI>Luther, Oec lampa|dius, Zuinglius, Bucerus, Calvin, Musculus, Bullinger,</HI> and the generall sence of the Protestant writers. See the <HI>Smetonii respons; ad Hamilton. Apostat.</HI> pag. 6. If there was not a true Church, when Popery and Antichristianisme had most uni|versally spred it self, why is it said that Antichrist <HI>sitteth in the Temple of God,</HI> 2. <HI>Thes:</HI> 2. 4? And if God had not a peo|ple in Babylon, why is it said, <HI>Come out of her, my people Rev.</HI> 18. 4? And if there were not all that time, even before the Reformation, true Ministers of Christ, why are the two wit|nesses said to Prophesie 1260. dayes (compting dayes for years) in sackcloath. <HI>Rev:</HI> 11. 3. 5. Sure the time of the witnesses, their Prophesying in sackcloath, where ever we fix the beginning and ending of it (which is contraverted) it doth certainly comprehend those ages before the Reformation, as a part of this time. Therefore Christ had his Witnesses and
<PB N="64" REF="41">
Ministers all that while. Protestants as well as Papists, hold the perpetuity of the true Church and Ministery, though not ever visible or alike pure. And otherwise, how shall we under|stand Christs owne word, <HI>Mat:</HI> 28. 20. <HI>Loe, I am with you al|way, even unto the end of the world.</HI> 4. Wherefore I conclude that those who were ordained in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> before the Reformation, in so far as they were ordained in the name of Christ, by these who had been themselves ordained Pres|byters as well as Bishops, and authorized to preach the Gos|pel, and administer the Sacraments; this far they were true and lawfull Ministers, truely and lawfully ordained. But in so farre as they were ordained according to the Popish statutes and Canons, for teaching and maintaining the traditions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and for offering up the body of Christ in the Masse, in this consideration; their calling and Ordina|tion was impure and unlawfull, like pure water flowing out of a clean fountain, which contracts impurity from a filthie chan|nel it runs through.

<P> Whether these Prophets and Prophesyings in the primitive Church, <HI>1 Cor. 14.</HI> and <HI>1 Cor. 12. 28.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THere are three opinions concerning these Prophets mentioned by the Apostle, 1. That they had nei|ther extraordinary and immediate inspirations of the Spirit, nor yet were ordinary Ministers called to the office of Teaching, but Church-members out of office, ha|ving
<PB N="65" REF="41">
good gifts of opening and interpreting the Scriptures, for the edification, instructioun, and comfort of the Church, and hence is the warrant taken, for the preaching or prophesying of such Church-members as are well gifted, being neither Mi|nisters, nor intending the Ministery: Neither doe the <HI>Inde|pendents</HI> onely, but <HI>Socintans,</HI> and <HI>Arminians</HI> also cry up that <HI>libertas prophetandi.</HI> 2. That these Prophets were Church officers, and no more but ordinary Teachers or Interpreters of Scripture in the Church: without excluding the sons of the Prophets, or Probationers from their Assembly, and from exercising their gifts in preaching upon occasion, and fortryall of their gifts, or of the grouth and encreas thereof, yet I remem|ber no place in the new Testament, where ordinary Pastors are said to prophesie, except <HI>Revel:</HI> 11. 3. where notwithstand|ing, prophesie is ascribed unto them in no other sence, than the working of miracles, <HI>vers:</HI> 6. <HI>Those have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the dayes of their prophesie, and have power over waters to turne them into blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.</HI> All which (prophesying and miracles) is spoken by way of allusion to <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias.</HI> 3. That they were extraordinary Prophets, immediatly and extraordinarly inspyred by the holy Ghost; and that they are to be reckoned among these other administrations which were notto continue, or be ordinary in the Church. <HI>Synop: pur: theol: disp:</HI> 42. <HI>thes:</HI> 22. <HI>Martyr, loc: com: class:</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 1. <HI>Aretius, probl: theol. loc:</HI> 62. <HI>Calvin.

The Prophets are enumerate among the publike Ministers which Christ hath given to the Church; Yet distinct from the ordinary Pastors and Teachers, 2.

And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, or as the <HI>Syriak</HI> readeth, <HI>and some Pastors and some Teachers,</HI> so distinguisheth Pastors from Teachers, as M^r. <HI>Bayne</HI> also doth: understanding here five, degrees of those who labour in the Word and Do|ctrine, the first three extraordinary, the last two ordinary. I know 'tis not alwayes preferred in honour and dignity, which is first mentioned: Yet I think our dissenting Brethren would not think it fit, nor suteable to enumerate their gifted and pro. phesying members, next to the Apostles, and before Pastors much lesse Evangelists, neither do I ground my argument sim|ply and meerly upon the enumeration, but upon such an enu|meration as is noted, with first, second, third, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12. 28. <HI>And God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdlie Teachers,</HI> where he puts upon the Prophets the highest eminency and chiefest dignity next to the Apostles, which I thinke the prophesyi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">g B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ethren of this age doe not look for; <HI>Chrysostome, de divers: nov: Test: locis: serm:</HI> 50. proves the chief dignity of Apostleship from these words: <HI>First Apostles:</HI> Is it not as good an argument to prove the next dig|nitie, to belong to prophesie from these words, <HI>Secondarilie Prophets.</HI> 'Tis true <HI>helps</HI> are mentioned before <HI>governments</HI> in that same Text.

them Preachers, so that the difproportion is not so great when the Deacon is named before the ruling Elder: but that such Preachers or Interpreters who had no office at all in the Church, should be enumerate, not onely among officers and Ministers of the Church, but before Teachers, and that in foure Texts, <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 11. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 28. ibid. <HI>vers:</HI> 29. <HI>Ephes:</HI> 4. 11. and next to the Apostles too, and that with an order, of first, second, third, is to me utterly improblable and uncre|dible. 3. The Apostle mentioneth Prophets with a note of singularity, as not common, but more speciall, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12. 29, 30. <HI>Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? are all Workers of miracles? Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all Interpret?</HI> Here the Apostle maketh a se|cond enumeration of such administrations as were more rare; singular, speciall, dignified, and priviledged, and not compe|tent to all Church officers, much lesse to all Church-members: Therefore here he omitteth the ruling Elder and Deacon; <HI>Hee saith not are all helps? are all governments?</HI> As if he had said; There are some officers appointed onely for ruling, some appointed onely for helping and overseeing the poore; These officers are neither Apostles nor Prophets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if prophesying be not a priviledge of all Church-officers, how much lesse of all Church-members: I might adde here, 'tis most agreeable to the native signification of the word <HI>Prophesie,</HI> that we under|stand it to be an extraordinary and rare thing; For if you con|sider the very notation of the word <HI>Prophesie</HI> is prediction, and <GAP DESC="foreign"> is from <GAP DESC="foreign">, I foretell, of which more hereafter. 4. One of the Prophets of that time, is plainly described to have been inspired with extraordinary revelations, <HI>Acts</HI> 21. 10, 11. <HI>There came down from Iudea a certain Prophet, named</HI> Agabus, <HI>and when he was come unto us, he took</HI> Pauls <HI>girdle, and bound his owne hands and feet, and said; Thus saith the holie Ghost, so shall the Iews at Ierusalem bind the man that oweth this girdle, and shall</HI>

But if God give me opportunity, I shal think it worth the while to make a collection of these things: Mean while although such Prophets be extraordinary, and but sel|dome raised up in the Church, yet such there have been: I dare say, not onely in the primitive times, but amongst our first Re|formers, and others. And upon what Scripture can we pitch for such extraordinary Prophets. If not upon those Scriptures which are applyed by some to the prophesying Brethren, or gifted Church-members; 8. There are but three senses of the word <HI>Prophesying,</HI> which I can finde any where else in the new Testament.</P>
<P>1. For such prophesying as is competent to all converted and gifted persons, when they are filled with a spirit of illumi|nation, and speak with other tongues as the spirit gives them utterance: In which sense <HI>Ioel</HI> foretold, that daughters as well as sonnes, hand maids as well as men-servants, young and old should prophesie, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 17, 18. Which was accordingly ful|filled upon the day of Penticost, for <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 14. and 2. 1. 4. This Spirit of Prophesie was powred out upon all the Disci|ples, men and women.</P>
<P>2. For such prophesying, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s is the preaching of ordinary Mini|sters, although I know no Text where without any contro|versie,
<PB N="71" REF="44">
the word is used for the ordinary Ministeriall preach|ing; Yet I understand the word to bee used, in this sence, (though by allusion onely where of before). <HI>Revel.</HI> 11. 3. <HI>And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesie a thousand two hundreth and threescore dayes cloathed in sackcloath.</HI></P>
<P>3. For extraordinary prophesying from immediate and miraculous inspiration, in which sence it is often used in the new Testament, as I shall shew anone.</P>
<P>But a fourth sense, <HI>viz.</HI> The prophesying of gifted Brethren, (not sisters) out of office, and that publickly, and by an ordi|nary gift, I can finde no where; and if we goe either higher or lower, then the ordinary Pastorall preaching, women as well as men might prophesie. in the Scripture language, Pro|phetesses, as well as Prophets. 9. The Apostle plainly di|stinguisheth, <HI>Prophesie,</HI> both from <HI>the word of knowledge, and from the word of wisdom,</HI> 1 Cor. 12. 8. 9. 10 <HI>For to one is given by the Spirit, the word of wisdome, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit, to another prophesie;</HI> now what is that gift and manifestation of the Spirit, which is supposed to be given to gifted and prophesying-members, must it not fall under that e|numeration, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

In that Text last cited, prophesie is mentioned, not only as a gift by which the Spirit worketh, for the profite and edifi|cation of the Church, but as a Ministery, function, and ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">i|nistration in the Church, for <HI>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s.</HI> 4. 5, 6.

But no body that I know doth imagine or can imagine that this is the sense of the word, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12. where <GAP DESC="foreign"> is joyned with <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">. Therefore I conclude that the Prophets in these primitive times, had an of|fice or Ministery in the Church. 11.

<HI>Prophetesse.</HI> 12 Prophecy (as <HI>Paul</HI> speakes of it) is so farre from being a common priviledge of gifted Saints out of office, that it is one of the speciall and rarest gifts which the Apostles themselves had or could have, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 2. <HI>And though I have the gift of prophesie, and understand all mysteries, and all know|ledge,</HI> which stands there between the gift of tongues, and the faith of miracles: again, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 16. <HI>Now brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I prosite you, except I shall speak unto you, either by Revelation, or by knowledge, or by Prophesying, or by Doctrine.</HI> The first two, <HI>Revelation,</HI> and know|ledge are immanent in the Apostle: The other two Prophesy|ing and Doctrine; are transient from the Apostle to the Church. What shall my gift of tongues profite you, saith he; or how shall you be edified or satisfied thereby, unlesse, either I utter some Revelation unto you by Prophesying, or utter my knowledge unto you by Doctrine, so distinguishing Prophe|sying from Doctrine as greater then it; because Prophesying proceeds from Revelation, Doctrine from knowledge, in him that teacheth. 13. I have yet another reason, which I think will be a hard knot to our dissenting Brethren, the Apo|stle compareth in that 14. <HI>Chap:</HI> the gifts of tongues, and the gifts of prophesie. He commendeth both, as desirable, <HI>vers:</HI> 1. and wisheth to them all both these gifts, <HI>vers:</HI> 6. but rather prophesie as comparatively the better for edifying the Church. <HI>Et magis &amp; minus, non variant speciem.</HI> There are both good and desirable gifts of the Spirit, given <HI>to profite withall,</HI> 1 Cor. 12. 7, 10, 11. The Apostle also alloweth as many to speak with tongues in the Church, as hee alloweth to prophesie in the Church; that is, as two or three of the Prophets may speak by course in one Assembly, so may two or three speak by course in a strange tongue, so that one interpret, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 27, 29. Moreover, whereas it is supposed by our dissenting brethren, that all or most of the Church, women excepted, did prophesie;
<PB N="74" REF="46">
they must upon the very same ground, suppose that all or most of the Church, women excepted; spake strange tongues in the Church. For in the same place where 'tis said, that e|very one of them had a Doctrine and Revelation, 'tis said also that every one of them had a tongue and an Interpretation, 1. <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 26. Which tongues considered and compared to|gether, it will be found, that if the reasons hold good, and the consequences be valid, which are brought for the prophe|sying of gifted members out of office, and that therein they have the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> a president, the like reasons, and als strong consequences will prove, that any two or three of a Church, who shall happilie have the gift of strange tongues, may speak by course in the Church, so that one Interpret, and that the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> is as good a president for this, as for the other; Let our Brethren therefore, either make both these gifts (prophesie, and tongues) in the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> to bee extraordinary and miraculous, and so neither of them to bee an ordinary president: or otherwise, they must make them both to be set forth for ordinary Patterns and presidents, and so begin to cry up tongues, as well as prophesying, for if the gift of prophesie, be such as men may attaine by industrie and study, so is the gift of tongues: I know no way to loose the knot without acknowledging, that both the gift of tongues and that of prophesie, were extraordinary and miraculous, which is the truth.</P>
<P>These are the reasons which I lean to in this matter. I come next to answere, <HI>Objections.</HI> The first three Objections I finde in the <GAP DESC="foreign"> concerning Ordination: But I shall answere other Objections also omitted there, but which have been objected by others.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. The Prophets, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14 were not immediatlie in|spired with prediction; for women that were so inspired, might deliver their prophesie in the Church, but there wo|men
<PB N="75" REF="46">
are forbidden to speak, <HI>vers:</HI> 34. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. But where finde we that women which were prophetesses, and immediately inspired, were allowed to deliver their prophesie in the Church. I suppose he had a respect to 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. 5. <HI>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head covered, disho|noureth her head,</HI> which is meaned of the publicke Assemblie, for the Apostle is speaking of covering, or uncovering the head in the Church. But diverse Interpreters understand here by a woman, that prayeth or prophesieth, a woman that joyn|eth as a hearer in the publicke Assemblie, and so <HI>vers:</HI> 4. by a man that prayeth or prophesieth, a man that is a hearer, and joyneth in the ordinances. So that the <HI>Geneva</HI> annotation up|on <HI>verse</HI> 5. gives a good sence of that Text: <HI>That women which shew themselves in publick and ecclesiasticall Assemblies, with|out the signe and token of their subjection, that is to sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, uncovered, shame themselves.</HI> See more for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s in <HI>Junius</HI> his annotations on the <HI>Arabike</HI> version in that place. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. If the Apostle by prophesying, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. 4. 5. Understand prophesying by immediate inspiration, then the Objection may bee retorted and turned into an Argument against the Objectors: For the sence of the word prophesying in the 11. <HI>Chap:</HI> may give light to the word prophesying in the 14. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>Peter Martyr, loc: com: eccles:</HI> 4. <HI>cap:</HI> 1. Is indeed of opinion, that women which were prophetesses, and extraordinarly inspired, might sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ak in the Church, provided that their heads were covered, in token of <HI>foeminine</HI> subjection, and that the forbidding of women to speak in the Church, extendeth to such, and so hee reconcileth, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 34. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 13. with 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. 5. I doubt his opinion in this particular is not well grounded, onely so farre I make use of it, that if 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. 5. be meant of prophetesses, praying or prophesying in the Church, (which the Objector hath to prove). Then certainely the forbidding of women to speak in the Church, cannot be understood uni|versallie,
<PB N="76" REF="47">
but with a reserve and exception of extraordinary cases: But how can this exception of prophetesses consist with with the Text, <HI>Let your women keep silence in the Church,</HI> Why <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Your women,</HI> they had prophesying women, as is suppo|sed by these of the other opinion, from 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. 5. Nay, even your women must be silent saith the Apostle; and the reasons which he addeth, are so universall as to comdrehend even pro|phetesses, they are commanded to be under obedience, and to be in subjection, which <HI>Martyr</HI> himselfe noteth, holds true of prophesying women, as well as others, and that for that cause their heads were to be covered: Another reason is ad|ded, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 14. <HI>Adam was not deceaved, but the woman be|ing deceaved, was in the transgression:</HI> It might be feared, saith <HI>P. Martyr,</HI> if women were permitted to speak in the Church, Sathan should returne to his first wyle, and deceave the man by the woman. Surely he that made use of <HI>Evah,</HI> might also make use of a prophesying woman to deceave, and so much the more, because, now since the fall, both man and woman are more subject to tentation. So that both the Apostles command, and the reasons of it seem plainly to exclude, even prophesying women from speaking in the Church, and if they be allowed to deliver extraordinary prophesies and revelations in the Church; why not also to prophesie as other gifted members. If that which is greater be allowed them, why not that which is lesse? And if prophetesses be excepted from the rule, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 34. Why not also other women of excellent gifts.</P>
<P><HI>Object:</HI> 2. The Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 24, 26. speaks of pro|phesie as a gift in all, or most of the members of the Church, and forbids it to none, but women. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. I have already proved from, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12. 28, 29. and 13. 2. and 14. 6. that prophesie even in those dayes, was not a common, but a rare and singular gift. So, <HI>ibid: vers.</HI> 5 when he saith, I would that all spake with tongues, but rather that yee prophesied;
<PB N="77" REF="47">
hee intimateth that all of them did not prophesie. 2. When the Apostle speaks by way of supposition, <HI>vers;</HI> 24: <HI>But if all prophesie,</HI> this proves not that all did prophesie, neither can the very supposition bee understood universally: For if an unbeleever had come into their Assembly, and heard all, and every one of them prophesying; sure he had been so farre from being wonne thereby, that he had been more alienated from such a confusion. 3. That which gives greatest collour to the Objection, is <HI>vers:</HI> 26. <HI>When yee come together every one of you hath a Psalme, hath a Doctrine, hath a Tongue, hath a Revelation, hath an Interpretation:</HI> I shall freely offer my judgement con|cerning this Text to be considered.

And thus I understand the Text now in controversie, the Apostle having from the beginning of that 14. <HI>Chap:</HI> perswaded that the gifts of tongues and prophesie might be used, not so as the men might be most admired, but so as the Church might be most
<PB N="78" REF="48">
edified, and that not so much the gifts, as the profitable use of the gifts was to be desired, he concludeth this point, <HI>vers:</HI> 26. Making a transition to certain Canons, for order in the use of tongues and prophesie, as if he had said, If these gifts be thus improved to edifie, then although every one of you hath not the gifts of tongues, prophesie, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet when yee come together, every one of you hath all these tongues, pro|phesies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They being yours, for your good and edifica|tion. 4. But if our dissenting Brethren will not receave this sence, (which is quite contrarie to theirs). Yet in this Text, here, they can no more extend to all or most of the members of the Church, one of these branches, then another: If all or most of them did prophesie, then all or most of them had the gift of tongues, and the Interpretation of tongues, and Revelati|ons, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ift of composing Psalmes, and so the same pre|sident shall bring in strange tongues, as well as prophesying, (of which more before) beside that of composing Psalmes. I shal hardly beleeve that our dissenting Brethren themselves will say, that all or most of the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> had the gift of tongues. Let us see then, how they will restrict the words <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>every one of you</HI> in reference to tongues, they must allow us to make the same restruction in reference to prophesie: But if they will say at large, that all or most of the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> had the gifts of tongues, as well as that of prophesie, then they are loosers another way, by yeelding the president of the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> (in that very place upon which they build their prophesying) to be extraordina|ry and miraculous. 5. Whereas the Objection saith, that all or most of them did prophesie, this addition, <HI>of most of them,</HI> is fictious and fallacious to hide weaknesse, for the Text hath no such thing, but saith, <HI>every one of you:</HI> Themselves dare not understand <HI>every one of you,</HI> universally, but in a restricted sence, for then <HI>Prophets,</HI> and Brethren should bee acciprocall,

and convertible names in the Epistles to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and when 'tis said, <HI>the spirits of the Prophets are subject to the prophets,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 32. the sence should bee no more, but equi|valent (upon the matter) to this, the spirits of all the Brethren are subject to the Brethren. 6. Wherefore, <HI>every one of you, vers:</HI> 26. (if extended to prophesying) can be no more, but every one of you prophets, even as <HI>Isa:</HI> 1. 23. <HI>every one. i. e.</HI> every one of the Princes; <HI>Heb:</HI> 2. 9.

<P><HI>Object:</HI> 3. These gifts which are required in a Prophet, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 3. 26. are such as men ordinarly may, and do attain by industry and study <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. The contrary hath been clear|ly proved, and that wery Text, <HI>vers:</HI> 26. proveth it; the more strange it is, that a Text which mentioneth revelation, tongues, should be cited for ordinary study and industrie. 2. 'Tis said indeed, <HI>vers:</HI> 3. <HI>He that prophesieth,</HI> speaketh unto men to edi|fication, and exhortation, and comfort. What then; did not an extraordinary Prophet, an Apostle, an Evangelist speak unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort? No man dare deny, but they did, yet this cannot prove that Apo|stles and evangelists were not extraordinary Ministers: The edification and fruit which come to the Church by these Pro|phets, is one thing, the way of revelation and inspiration by which the prophesie came, another thing: the Apostle is there onely comparing two extraordinary and miraculous gifts to|gether, tongues and prophesie: Of the two, prophesie is ra|ther to be desired, for the edifying of the Church, for he that speaketh a strange tongue, cannot edifie the Church, except it be interpreted, but he that prophesieth, edifieth the Church by his very gift of prophesie, with lesse businesse, and without an interpreter; This being the scope and sence of the Text, it may discover the weaknesse of that ground, upon which many have supposed that the Apostle means nothing by prophesie, but the ordinary gift of expounding, and applying Scripture; yea, <HI>vers:</HI> 6. prophesie and revelation, are at once held forth, both as edifying, and as distinct from doctrine, and revelation di|stinct from knowledge, must needs be taken a gift, and not to be numbred among ordinary gifts (as <HI>Iunius</HI> upon the <HI>A|rabike,</HI> in the place noteth) what ever acceptions of the word,

But the Apostle bids them desire that they may prophesie, <HI>vers:</HI> 1. how can one desire, or pray in faith for a miraculous and extraordinary gift of the Spirit. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. He bids them not onely desire, that they might prophesie, but that they might have other spirituall gifts, such as the gifts of tongues, So <HI>vers:</HI> 1. and the interpretations of tongues, and hee wishes to them all the gift of tongues, now the gift of tongues was extraordinary and miraculous, as <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 6, 7, 8. They might desire both the one gift and the other, to glorifie God, and to profite withall. 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12. 7. yea, they might pray for it in faith for these ends, and so much the more, because <HI>Mark.</HI> 16. 17. the promise is made to be|leevers of that first age. <HI>And these signes shall follow them that beleeve, in my name shall they cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, &amp;c.</HI> And why might not the prayer of faith obtaine the gift of prophesie, as well as recover the sick, <HI>Iam:</HI> 5. 15. al|though neither the one nor the other might be prayed for, with that absolutenesse, and peremptorinesse of desire, as saving mercies and graces necessarie to salvation, which is intimated in part by the different phrase, noted by <HI>Erasmus,</HI> and others to be used, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 1. <HI>follow after charity,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, pur|sue it, or as (the <HI>Syriak</HI>) runne after it, so follow after love, as never to be satisfied till ye overtake it, be earnest in the pur|suite of it. But concerning tongues, prophesie, and the like, he addeth; and desire spirituall gifts <GAP DESC="foreign"> a word which fal|leth short of the other, not signifying any affecting of any thing with all our endeavour (as the other word doth) but only a high esteeming, valuing, admiring, wishing of a thing which, yet, if it be denyed to us, we must sit down satisfied without it.</P>
<P><HI>Object:</HI> 5. But these Prophets were to be judged, examined and tryed, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 29. 32. therefore it seemes they were not extraordinary Prophets infallibly inspired. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. If
<PB N="82" REF="50">
those who came under the name of extraordinary Prophets, might not be tryed and examined, why are there so many ca|veats in the new Testament, to beware of false Prophets, <HI>Mat:</HI> 7. 15. and 24. 11, 24. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 1. Did not the Lord admit of <HI>Moses</HI> his objection, that peradventure the children of <HI>Is|rael</HI> would not beleeve him, that God had appeared unto him, and sent him, wherein God will have him to satisfie them by signes and miracles, <HI>Exod.</HI> 4. 1. to <HI>vers:</HI> 10. are not the <HI>Bere|ans</HI> commended, <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 11. for proving and trying the Do|ctrine of the Apostles themselves by the Scriptures? 2. Al|though such as had the gift of prophesie, did not, nor could not erre, so farre as they were inspired by the holy Ghost in prophesying, much lesse in writing Scripture, yet they might have, and some had their owne mistakes and errors in particu|lar cases; whereof I shall have one instance in <HI>Elias,</HI> who said, he was left alone: <HI>But what saith the answere of God unto him, I have reserved to my selfe seven thousand, &amp;c.</HI> He spake from his own spirit, when he said he was left alone, but the answer of God corrects his mistake. Another instance in those prophesying Disciples, <HI>Acts</HI> 21. 4. <HI>Who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not goe up to Ierusalem.</HI> Therefore fore|telling and foreknowing of <HI>Pauls</HI> danger at Jerusalem, was from the spirit of prophesie, but the consequence they did draw from hence, that therefore <HI>Paul</HI> should not go up to Jerusalem. This Interpreters conceave, was only from their own spirits, though they misfathered it upon the Spirit of God. 3. 'Tis well observed in the English annotations upon 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 32. <HI>That although those prophesies were infused by the holy Ghost, that cannot erre, yet all things are not alwayes revealed to one, and that which is not revealed to one, is oftentimes revealed to more, and sometimes in clearer manner. There might be also some thing min|gled with that which the Prophets receaved, and it might fall out, that that which they added of their own, by way of confirmation, il|lustration</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="50">
<HI>or application, might be justly subject to censure, wheher it must be tryed and judged by others, whether the prophesies proceed from the inspiration of the holy Spirit, and according to the rule of faith, Esa.</HI> 8. 20.</P>
<P><HI>Object:</HI> 6. The Apostle distinguisheth Prophesie from mini|stery, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 6, 7. therefore they who prophesied, were gifted persons out of office. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. Diverse resolve that Text thus, that first the Apostle maketh a generall division of Ecclesiasti|call offices, <HI>Prophesie,</HI> comprehending these that labour in the word and doctrine, <HI>Ministery</HI> comprehending those that labour not in the word and doctrine, and that thereafter the Apostle subdivideth prophesying into the pastorall and doctorall fun|ction: and Ministery, he subdivideth into the office of the ru|ling Elder, Deacon, and the other of shewing mercy, which was committed sometimes to old men, sometimes to widows. 2. When I look again and again unto that Text, I rather in|cline to understand by prophesie there, the extraordinary pro|phesie, and by Ministery, the ordinary offices in the Church. <HI>Having then gifts saith the Apostle, and differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophesie, let us prophesie according to the proportion of faith&punc;</HI> that under the colour of prophesie and revelation, wee bring nothing which is not agreeable to the rule of faith, <HI>Or Ministery, let us wait on Ministery.</HI> If our office and administration be ordinary, let us attend it; and not slight it, because it is ordinary. Then he enlargeth this last by an enu|meration of the ordinary offices in the Church, Pastors, Teachers, ruling Elders and Deacons. While I am writing these things, I finde <HI>Gomarus</HI> upon <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 6, 7. of the same opi|nion, that prophesie is meant here of that which is extraordi|nary, Ministery of that which is ordinary.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 7. But that Text, <HI>The Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets,</HI> is applyed by many Presbyteriall writers, for the upholding the authority of Classes, and Synods, which is
<PB N="84" REF="51">
not a good argument of these prophets, if these Prophets were extraordinary. <HI>Answ.</HI> This makes the argument nothing the weaker but so much the stronger. For if Prophets who were immediatly inspired, were to be subject to the examination, and judgment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nd censure of other Prophets, and if <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barna|bas</HI> gave an account, before the Apostles and Elders at Jerusalem of their doctrine, so much opposed by some at <HI>Antioh, Acts</HI> 15. and if <HI>Peter</HI> being accused for going in to the uncircumcised, was put to make his defence to them at Jerusalem, <HI>Acts</HI> 11. then <HI>&agrave; fortiori,</HI> it doth much more become ordinary Pastors and Teachers, to submit to the judgment of an Assembly of Pa|stors and Teachers; And generally as in civil justice, 'tis a good and equall rule, that a man be judged <HI>per pares,</HI> so pro|portionably in Church censures, it will hold among Church officers or Ministers, that they should be judged <HI>per pares,</HI> an Apostle by the Apostles, a Prophet by the Prophets, an El|der by the Elders.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 8. <HI>Iudas</HI> and <HI>Stlas</HI> are called Prophets, <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 32. and they exhorted the Church, yet they were out of office, for they are distinguished from the Apostles and Elders, and said to be chiefe men among the Brethren, <HI>vers:</HI> 22. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. This president will carry the prophesying Brethren very high, for <HI>Silas</HI> is reckoned by Divines to have been an Evan|gelist, which may be collected from his travelling through so many places with <HI>Paul,</HI> for spreading the Gospell, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 17. <HI>Act:</HI> 17. 4, 10. 14, 15. <HI>Act.</HI> 18. 5. others think hee had a Ministeriall charge at Jerusalem, but the former opinion seems to be better grounded. 2. The word <HI>Brethren</HI> and <HI>Bro|ther,</HI> does not ever note such as were out of office in the Church, but 'tis diverse times used, (and so I take it here) of such as were neither fixed as Elders nor so eminent in the Church as Apostles, but had speci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l and extraordinary em|ployments, or administrations in the Church, as 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 8. 18.

<P>And now in the close, my advise and exhortationis unto such Brethren as take upon them to preach, or prophesie, nei|ther being nor intending to be ordained to the Ministery, that they would yet take them to serious second thoughts of this businesse, and seeing that prophesying which they take for their president, hath been so clearly proved to have been ex|traordinary, seeing also Christ hath appointed Pastors and Teachers for the ordinary work of the publicke teaching, edi|fying the Church, and perfecting the Saints, <HI>Ephes:</HI> 4. 11. 12. (which ordinance is sufficient for that end), those Brethren should do well to improve their gifts in another way, by wri|ting, and by occasionall exhorting, admonishing, instructing, reproving, comforting others, in that fraternall manner, which is sutable to Christians out of office: If they desire any other work in the Church, let them desire the Pastorall office, and offer themselves to tryall in order thereunto, for as <HI>Greg: Nazianzen</HI> saith, <HI>orat:</HI> 7. Christ hath appointed this order in his Church, that the flocke may be one thing, Pastors another thing; And again, <HI>'tis a great businesse to teach, but it is safe and harmlesse to learn, why makest thou thy selfe a Pastor, when thou art one of the flock.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Whether any other but a Minister, lawfully called and ordained, may administer the Sacraments, Baptisme and the Lords supper.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe <HI>Socinians</HI> and the <HI>Erastian</HI> Crutch-maker before mentioned, so plead against the necessity of Ordina|tion, that they held it lawfull and free to gifted per|sons not ordained, not onely to preach, but to ad|minister the Sacraments whether they extend this to women as well as men, I know not. Peradventure they will borrow from the <HI>Pagans</HI> those shee priests whom <HI>Gellius</HI> out of <HI>Cicero,</HI> cals <HI>Antistitas,</HI> not <HI>Antistites,</HI> or happilie they hold with the old <HI>Pepuzians,</HI> that women may both preach and administer the Sacraments, at least, if they may not speak in the Church, (because that is forbidden, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 32. although some are so bold as to restrict that prohibition to married women, where|of they think they have some colour from the context) that yet they may both preach and administer the Sacraments in private places. And if there be no more necessary to one that preacheth or ministereth the Sacraments, but onely gifts and abilities, how can they avoid to allow gifted women, as well as gifted men to performe these holy things?</P>
<P>But it is justly held by the reformed Churches, and ordered in the Directorie of Worship agreed upon by both Kingdoms, and mentioned also in the late Confession of faith, <HI>chap:</HI> 27. that neither Baptisme nor the Lords Supper may be dispensed by any, but by a Minister of the Word lawfullie ordained. Nay (say the soundest Protestant writers) not upon pretence of whatsoever necessitie be it among <HI>Iews, Turks, Pagans,</HI> or to children dying, or the like.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="52">The arguments I lean to, are these. 1. God hath appointed the Minister of the word, lawfully called and ordained, and no other to bee the stewards and dispensers of the mysteries of Christ, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 4. 1. <HI>Let a man so account of us, as of the Mi|nisters of Christ, and Stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required of Stewards, that a man be found faithfull.</HI> Which the Apostle doeth not onely apply to himselfe and <HI>Apollo, vers:</HI> 6. (where by the way it may be remembred that <HI>Apollo</HI> was neither an Apostle, nor Evangelist, but a powerfull Minister of the Gospell) and to <HI>Sosthenes</HI> (as appeareth by comparing the Text new cited with 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 1. 1.) but he also applyeth the same to every lawfull Bishop, or ordinary Mini|ster, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 7. for a Bishop must be blamelesse as the steward of God, and this steward is ordained, <HI>vers:</HI> 5. So <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 42. <HI>Who then is that faithfull and wise steward, whom his Lord shall make ruler over his houshold, to give them their portion of meat in due season.</HI> 'Tis not Christs will that any one of the houshold, who is faithfull, wise, and discreet, may take upon him the stewards office, to dispense meat to the rest. But there is a steward constituted and appointed for that purpose. There are stewards appointed in the Church, which is the house of the living God, and those to continue till the coming of Christ, <HI>ibid: vers:</HI> 43. 46. and there is nothing which more properly belongeth to the Ecclesiasticall stewards, then the dispensation of the Sacraments.</P>
<P>2. Ministers lawfully called and ordained, and none other hath Christ appointed to bee Pastors or Sheepherds, to feed the flocke of God, <HI>Ier:</HI> 3. 15. <HI>Eph:</HI> 4. 11. <HI>Act:</HI> 20. 28. 1 <HI>Pet:</HI> 5. 2. Much of this feeding consisteth in the dispensation of the Sacraments. And hee who hath appointed this food to be receaved by some, hath also appointed to be given, and ad|ministred by others. Surely hee who is so much displeased with Pastors, who feed themselves and not the flocke, will
<PB N="88" REF="53">
not be well pleased with the flocke which will be their owne feeders onely, and will not be fed by the Pastor. <HI>Grotius</HI> had an extravagant notion of communicating, where there are no Sacramentall Elements, or where there are no Pastors to ad|minister, yet although he went too farre, those against whom I now argue, doe farre outreach him, for where there are both Elements and Pastors to administer, they hold there may be a Sacrament without any Pastor; Yea, this <HI>Socinian</HI> and <HI>Ana|baptisticall</HI> way, takes away the very distinction of Pastor and flocke in the Church, as if any of the sheep were to feed the sheepherd, as well as he them.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Ezekiels</HI> vision concerning the new Temple, is generally acknowledged to bee an Evangelicall prophesie, which I have also else where demonstrate by infallible reasons: But I con|ceave the Sectaries of this time, who cry downe the Ministery and Ordination, doe not nor will not deny it. Sure I am such a materiall Temple as is described in that vision, never yet was. Now among other things, it is there prophesied concerning the Ministers of the Gospell, <HI>Ezek:</HI> 44. 16. <HI>They shall enter into my Sanctuarie, and they shall come near unto my table to Minister unto me; and they shall keep my charge.</HI> Whereof we can make no Gospell sence, except it belong to the charge of Ministers, lawfully called and entered into that work, to administer the Sacraments, and namelie that of the Lords Sup|per at his Table. These Ministers are also in that Chapter plainly distinguished from the people, or children of <HI>Israel, vers:</HI> 15. 19, 22, 23, 28.</P>
<P>4. The Sacraments are seals of the righteousnesse of faith, or covenant of grace, as Divines commonly speak, borrowing the phrase from <HI>Rom:</HI> 4. 11. This truely hath been justly ac|counted so necessary, that both the Houses of Parliament after consultation, had with the Assemblie of Divines, did by the Ordinance dated, <HI>Octob:</HI> 20. 1645. appoint that who ever
<PB N="89" REF="53">
doth not know <HI>that the Sacraments are seals of the Covenant of grace,</HI> shall not be admitted to the Lords-supper, but shall be suspended from it, as an ignorant person. Now if it were an intolerable usurpation among men, if a privat person should take the broad Seal of the Kingdome, and append it to such Signatures as he thinks good; yea, (put case) to these Sig|natures onely, whereunto it is to be, and ought to be put by those who are intrusted with the keeping of it: Now much more were it a provoking sinne, and usurpation against Jesus Christ (who is jealous of his glory, and tender of his ordi|nances) to make bold with his Seals, without being called, and appointed thereunto.</P>
<P>5. Christ gives a commission to the Apostles, to Teach, and Baptize, and extends the same commission to all Teach|ing Ministers, to the end of the world, <HI>Mat:</HI> 28. 19. 20. from which place 'tis plaine; 1. That Jesus Christ would have the distinction of <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Taught: Baptizers</HI> and <HI>Baptized</HI> to have place in the Church alway, even unto the end. 2. That the commission to Teach and Baptize, was not given to all who beleeve in Jesus Christ, but to some onely. 3. That these <HI>some</HI> who receaved this commission, are not only the A|postles, but ordinary Ministers, as is manifested by the explain|ing of the commission, and promise to the end of the world.</P>
<P>6. Christ hath distinguished between Magistracy and Mini|stery, between civil and sacred vocations, <HI>Mat:</HI> 22. 21. <HI>Mat:</HI> 16. 19. &amp;c. 18. 18, &amp;c: 28. 19. <HI>Ioh:</HI> 20. 23. <HI>Rom:</HI> 13. 1. 7. 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 2. 2. 1 <HI>Pet:</HI> 2. 13, 14. compared with <HI>Rom:</HI> 12. 6, 7, 8. 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12. 28. <HI>Eph:</HI> 4. 11. 1 <HI>Thes:</HI> 5. 12. <HI>Heb:</HI> 13. 7, 17. So that as Ministers may not assume civil dignities and admi|nistrations, nor exercise seculare power, <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 22. 25. 26. <HI>Ioh:</HI> 18. 36. 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 10. 4. 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 2. 4. It is no lesse contrary to the ordinance of Christ, that Magistrates (or any other civil persons) stretch themselves beyond their lyne, and
<PB N="90" REF="54">
get (with <HI>Pompey</HI>) into the holy of holies, or with <HI>Vzziah</HI> to the burning of incense, in both which examples, such intrusi|on was examplarily punished. As it may be said to a seculari|zed Minister, who made thee a Judge, or a civil Magistrate? so it may be said, to a Ministerialized civil person, who made thee a dispenser of the Word and Sacraments?</P>
<P>7. Wee have cleare and convincing examples in the new Testament, that the Sacraments were administred by publicke Ministers, called and appointed thereunto, as Baptisme by <HI>Iohn,</HI> (<HI>Ioh:</HI> 1. 33. <HI>he hath sent me to baptize</HI>) and frequently by the Apostles in the story of the <HI>Acts.</HI> The Lords supper admini|stred by Christ himself, (whose example in things imitable we are bidden follow, who also himselfe then commanded <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>this doe</HI>). And by the Apostle <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 20. 7, 11. <HI>so the breaking of bread</HI> is joyned with <HI>the Apostles doctrine and fellowship,</HI> Acts 2. 42. Ministers being also called the stewards and dispensers of the mysteries of God, where of before: So that a lawfull Minister may in faith administer, and the recea|vers receave from him in faith the Sacraments, having Scrip|ture warrands for so doing. But there is neither any commis|sion from Christ, to such as are no Church officers, to ad|minister the Sacraments: Nor can there any cleare example be found in the new Testament, of administering either the one Sacrament or the other, by any person who can be proved, not to have been a Minister lawfully called &amp; ordained. There|fore such persons cannot in faith administer, nor others in faith receave from them, either Baptisme or the Lords sup|per.</P>
<P>8. That one Text, <HI>Eph:</HI> 4. 11. 12, 13. is enough to put to silence these gainsayers. <HI>And hee gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saincts, for the work of the Mi|nistery, for the edifying the body of Christ, till wee all come,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="91" REF="54">
Is not the administration of the Sacraments a part of the per|fecting of the Saints, of the work of the Ministrie, of the edify|ing of the body of Christ? And are we not told that this shall continue till the whole number of the Elect be fulfilled? And whom hath Christ given here to his Church for this work? Hath he given any other but Pastors and Teachers (setting aside the extraordinary officers) and who are the Pastors and Teachers appointed hereunto? All, or whosoever will? Nay not all, but <HI>some,</HI> saith the Text.</P>

<P> Of Prophets and Evangelists, in what sense their Work and Voca|tion might be called extraordinary; and in what sense ordinary.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THis Question appeareth to be very perplexed and thornie, yet I am led upon it both by the contraver|sies of the times, concerning the necessity of Mission and Ordination unto all Ministers of holy things, and likewise by occasion of that which is maintained by some men of Learning that there are still or may be Evangelists in the Church. <HI>Calvin</HI> holds indeed that in that age of his, God raised up Evangelists to rescue the Church from Popery <HI>Instit lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 3. &sect; 4. and M^r. <HI>Hooker</HI> in his Ecclesiasticall policie, <HI>lib.</HI> 5. <HI>Sect:</HI> 78. tels us out of <HI>Eusebius eccles: hist: lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap:</HI> 34. that in <HI>Trajans</HI> dayes many of the Apostles Disciples and Scholers who were then alive, sold their possessions, which they gave to the poor, <HI>and betaking themselves to travel, undertook the labour of Evangelists, that is, they painfully preached Christ, and delivered to them who as yet never heard the doctrine of Faith.</HI> Concerning Prophets, I have before shewed out of <HI>Iustine Martyr dial:</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="55">
<HI>cum Tryph: Iud.</HI> That in his dayes there were still some in the Church, who had an extraordinary gift of prophesie, and such there have been also in other places, and at other times. Of which there might be diverse instances given, I shall here speak somewhat, first of the work of Prophets and Evangelists.</P>
<P>Their Work and Administration, I conceave to be partly ordinarie, partly extraordinarie. Ordinarie, because the higher degrees. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 11. are comprehensive of the lower, not con|trariwise, a Pastor doth the work of a Teacher, an Evangelist doth the work of a Pastor and Teacher, a Prophet doth the work of an Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher, an Apostle the work of all those, which I have also before touched, following <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> and M^r. <HI>Bayne.</HI> Prophets and Evangelists edifie the Church by preaching as well as ordinary Pastors, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 3. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 11. 12. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 2. 5. From which Scriptures and others of that sort, as <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 5. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 15. Some have col|lected that Evangelists had a fixed charge in some cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aine Church, which they attended and took the oversight thereof for the work of the Ministerie als often, and als long as other pressing and publick occasions of the Church could permit. See <HI>Zeperus de polit: eccl: lib:</HI> 2. <HI>cap:</HI> 1. <HI>Aret: probl: Theol: loc:</HI> 62.</P>
<P>I say again the work of Prophets and Evangelists was ex|traordinarie, for the distinguishing or characteristicall proper|tie of a Prophet, <HI>i. e.</HI> the outmost he could do, which the or|dinary officers could not do, nor any other, but an Apostle, is the opening of great secrets or foreshewing things to come, by the speciall and extraordinarie inspiration of the holy Ghost. Their verie name intimateth so much for <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> come from <GAP DESC="foreign"> I foretell. According to which sense of the word, all these were called Prophets of old, who foretold things to come, as Magitians, Astrologians, Prognosticators, Nativitie or figure-casters, &amp;c. See <HI>Olivarius de Prophetia pag:</HI> 9. 10. The Priests and Interpreters of the Oracles were also
<PB N="93" REF="55">
called Prophets, and the Apostle <HI>Tit:</HI> 1. 12. calls <HI>Epimenides</HI> a Prophet of the <HI>Cretians, qui quasi praesenserit futura,</HI> saith <HI>Eras|mus.</HI> As likewise saith he, because that book of <HI>Epimenides</HI> out of which that verse is cited hath its title <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>de oraculis.</HI> But in the Church notion of the word which the Fathers took from Scripture: Prophecy is a prediction of things to come from a special inspiration of the holy Ghost.</P>
<P>But what is the distinguishing work and characteristicall property of an Evangelist, <HI>i. e.</HI> that which an ordinary Pastor and Teacher might not do, and which none else could do but an Apostle or a Prophet? That I may speak to this more clear|ly, 'tis to be remembred, that the word <HI>Evangelist</HI> is not heere taken in that restricted vulgar sense, for a pen-man of the holy Ghost writing Gospell; for in that sense there were but foure Evangelists, and two of them Apostles. But this is not the Scripture notion of the word, which tels us that <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Timothie</HI> were Evangelists, <HI>Act.</HI> 21. 8. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 5. And that Christ hath given Evangelists to his Church for the work of the Ministery. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 11, 12. Now if we take the word as the Scripture doth, the proper work of an Evangelist <HI>i. e.</HI> that which none but an Evangelist as an Evangelist, or he who was more then an Evangelist could do, I conceave to stand in two things: the first is, to lay foundations of Churches, and to preach Christ to an unbelieving people, who have not yet re|cieved the Gospell, or at least who have not the true Doctrine of Christ among them. So <HI>Philip</HI> the Evangelist preached Christ to the citie of <HI>Samaria,</HI> and baptized them before any of the Apostles came unto them. <HI>Act.</HI> 8. 5. 12. And if the 70 Disciples <HI>Luk</HI> 10 were Evangelists (as many think, and <HI>Cal|vin Instit: lib:</HI> 4. <HI>cap:</HI> 3. 4. thinks it probable) their proper work as Evangelists, was to preach the Gospel to those cities which had not received it. Their second work is a traveling and negotiating as Messengers and Agents upon extraordinary
<PB N="94" REF="56">
occasions, and speciall emergencies which is oft times between one Church and another, and so distinct from the first which is a traveling among them that are yet without. Of this second there are diverse examples in Scripture, as 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 23. <HI>Phil:</HI> 2. 19. 25. 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 4. 9. <HI>Tit:</HI> 3 12 <HI>Act:</HI> 15 22 25. In this last exam|ple, although some are of opinion that <HI>Silas</HI> was of Jerusalem, and had an ordinary Ministeriall function there, yet the best writers do commonly reckon <HI>Silas</HI> among the Evangelists, and I do not doubt but as he was a Prophet, <HI>Act.</HI> 15. 32. so also an Evangelist, which may appeare by his traveling through many places, in the work of preaching the Gospel, sometimes with <HI>Paul,</HI> as his fellow labourer and helper: <HI>Act</HI> 16 19 &amp;c. 17. 4. 10. sometimes with <HI>Timothy, Act:</HI> 17. 14. 15. &amp; 18 15.</P>
<P>Now when I call these works and administrations of Pro|phets and Evangelists extraordinary, my meaning is not, that they are altogether and every way extraordinary even as Apo|stleship. For I dare not say that since the dayes of the Apostles there hath never been, or that to the end of the world there shall never be any raised up by God with such gifts, and for such administrations, as I have now described to be proper to Prophets and Evangelists, <HI>i. e:</HI> the fore telling of things to come, the traveling among Unbelievers to convert them by the preaching of the Gospell, and between one Church and ano|ther, upon extraordinary errands. But I call the work of Pro|phets and Evangelists extraordinary in <HI>Calvins</HI> sense (expres|sed by him in the place before cited) <HI>i. e.</HI> it is not ordinary like that of Pastors and Teachers, which hath place constantly in the best constituted and setled Churches. Shortly, I take the word <HI>Extraordinary</HI> here, not for that which ceased with the first age of the Christian Church, but for that which is not, neither needeth to be ordinary. And so much of their work:</P>

For as they were extraordinary Ministers, so they had an ex|traordinary Mission or Ordination als well as the Apostles, <HI>Luke</HI> 11. 49. Christ saith, <HI>I will send them Prophets and Apostles,</HI> and 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12 28. God hath set or appointed Prophets in the Church.

The ex|traordinarinesse of Evangelists is not so much without con|troversie, as he would bear his reader in hand, as may appear
<PB N="96" REF="57">
by what I have but now said: Neither can he prove that at that time, when the Presbytery laid hands on <HI>Timothy,</HI> he was even then an Evangelist or more then a Presbyter. However this I will say, that as the work, so also the Vocation of Evan|gelists, was partly extraordinary and partly ordinary, and as there may be still occasion for some of their extraordinary work, so there ought to be a speciall Mission and Vocation thereunto, not only inwardly from the Spirit of Gods stirring up unto and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">bling for the work, but outwardly also and or|derly in the Church The 70 Disciples were ordained by Christ himself, <HI>Luke</HI> 10. 1. <HI>The Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two.</HI> An Angell of the Lord spake unto <HI>Philip</HI> and called him from one place to another, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 26. The Apo|stle <HI>Paul</HI> sent <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> and resolved to send <HI>Timothie</HI> to the Church of the <HI>Philippians, Phil:</HI> 2. 25. 28. These are examples of extraordinary Mission, such I mean as ceased with that age, none being now immediatly sent by Christ or his Apostles. But there are other examples of a Mission or Calling to some|what of the proper work of Evangelists, which are not to be restricted to that age only; for they who were Agents and did travell and negotiat in the great and speciall affaires of the Church, had a speciall delegation and orderly call thereunto. So I understand that of <HI>the Messengers of the Churches,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 8. 23. And <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> being sent from the Church of <HI>Philippi|ans</HI> to <HI>Paul,</HI> is called there Apostle or Messenger. <HI>Phil&punc;</HI> 2. 25. So <HI>Iudas</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> who went out for the setlement of the di|stracted Churches, had a speciall commission and delegation thereunto from the Synod of the Apostles and Elders. 'Tis therefore most agreeable to the Primitive pattern, that where Synods or at least Classes may be had, and are not by persecuti|on scattered or hindred to meet, such as undertake either to goe &amp; preach the Gospel to Infidels, Papists, Turks or the like, or go about any negotiation abroad in any common bussines of the
<PB N="97" REF="57">
Church ought to be approved, and authorized by a nationall Synod, or (when that cannot be had, &amp; if there be withal great danger in the delay) by a provinciall Synod, or at least, (where this cannot he had) by a Classis.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> That the primitive Apostolicall pattern holdeth forth unto us for our imitation, a Presbyterie. <HI>i. e.</HI> an Assembly of Elders, having power of Ordination, with laying on of hands.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THis I gather from 1. <HI>Tim:</HI> 4. 14. neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophe|sie, with the laying on of the hands of the Presby|terie, I have already evinced from this Text, the necessity of Ordination. Let us now see, whether it doth not also shew us the right hands, unto which Christ hath com|mitted this power. It is a Text most miserably darkened and obscured by controversall Glosses, put upon it by Popish and Prelaticall writers: Some would have <GAP DESC="foreign"> here to bee a company of Bishops, who were both Elders, and more then Elders as they hold. This Interpretation had so little proba|bility of reason to strengthen it, that it was abandoned by some of the ablest friends of Episcopacy; <HI>Camero: praelect:</HI> in <HI>Mat:</HI> 18. 17. D^r. <HI>Forbesse Irenic: lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap:</HI> 11. <HI>pag:</HI> 161. And why should wee understand by Presbyterie, a company of Bishops, when it is yeelded even by writers of that side, that in these Cities where the Apostles planted the Gospel, there was <HI>Collegium Presbyterorum,</HI> a Colledge or company of Pres|byters. So M^r. <HI>Thorndike,</HI> of the government of Churches, <HI>cap.</HI> 3. The author of the History of <HI>Episcopacy, part:</HI> 2. <HI>pag:</HI> 28. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Both of them in this following <HI>Hooker.</HI> It was also
<PB N="98" REF="58">
acknowledged by them, that this Colledge of Presbyters did together with the Apostles lay on hands in Ordination, there|by contributing their blessing and assisting with their prayers, Whence (as was alledged) came the custome of the Presbyters, their laying on of hands in the Ordination, together with the Bishop, <HI>conc: Carthag:</HI> 4. <HI>can:</HI> 3. so that even themselves say as much as may make us understand by <GAP DESC="foreign"> in this Text, <HI>Concessus Presbyterorum</HI> as <HI>Camero</HI> cals it. The footsteps of Ordination by Presbyteries might be seen, not onely in that Canon of <HI>Carthage,</HI> but in the Canon law it self, which ap|pointeth the same thing, <HI>Dist:</HI> 23. <HI>cap:</HI> 8. Both <HI>Ambrose</HI> in <HI>Ephes:</HI> 4. and <HI>Augustine</HI> in <HI>quaest: ex utroque Test&punc;</HI> 4. 101. bear witnesse that Presbyters did ordaine in Egypt, when a Bishop was not present, D^r. <HI>Forbesse Irenie: lib:</HI> 2. <HI>pag.</HI> 177. citeth out of <HI>Pa|normitan, Olim Presbyteri in communi regebant Ecclesiam &amp; or|dinabant sacerdotes.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Glosse which the <HI>Erastians</HI> (who love not the name of Presbytery, with any power at all <HI>jure divino</HI>) are glad to take hold off. 'Tis that which <HI>Bilson, Stutlivius</HI> and other Episcopall writers made use of, distrusting (as it should seeme) that other Interpretation last mentioned: And they had it from <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> and some Popish expositors. See <HI>Gorranus</HI> upon the place: I confesse it was also one of <HI>Calvins</HI> few (for they were but very few) mistakes, and 'tis diligently catcht at by those who set at nought <HI>Calvins</HI> judgement in o|ther things. But <HI>quandoque dormitat Homerus.</HI></P>
<P>I think it worth the while to examine this Glosse. And I shall offer these reasons following, to make it appeare that <GAP DESC="foreign"> is not here the office of an Elder, but the Assembly of Elders, commonly called the Presbytery. 1. The word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is no where used by the holy Ghost, for the office it self, or degree of an Elder: But 'tis used in two other places in the new Testament, for an Assembly or Counsell of Elders,
<PB N="99" REF="58">
<HI>Luke</HI> 22. 66. <HI>Acts</HI> 22. 5. in which places <HI>Arias Montanus&punc;</HI> rendereth it by <HI>Senatus. Beza</HI> in the first of these places, retain|eth the word <HI>Presbyterium.</HI> In the other place, both his <HI>version</HI> and the <HI>Tigurine</HI> hath <HI>totus Seniorum ordo.</HI> But the old Eng|lish translation, readeth <HI>the company of Elders.</HI> However both places are clearly meaned of the company of Elders, not of the office it selfe, for the office of Elders could not meet together, as in that place of <HI>Luke:</HI> Neither could the office of Elders bear witnesse to <HI>Paul,</HI> as in that place of the <HI>Acts.</HI> M^r. <HI>Selden</HI> in his upon <HI>Ebraica, lib:</HI> 1. <HI>cap:</HI> 15. understands the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> in both these places to be used by <HI>Luke,</HI> for the great Sanhedrin, the highest Assembly of Elders. Now then, why shall we not understand the same word, 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 4. 14. to be the Assembly, not the office it selfe of Elders. And I shall aske those who think the Apostle means the office of Elders, upon what imaginable ground can they conceave that this is the A|postles meaning, or how come they to divine this thing, or how could the Apostles words be understood in that sense? The holy Gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st never useth the word in that sence. The <HI>Sep|tuagint</HI> never use the word in that sense, for they use it not at all. No Greek Author that lived before <HI>Paul,</HI> can be found to have used the word in that sense, for the word it self is not found in heathen writers. I finde onely one place where the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is conceaved to be used for the office of an El|der. And that is in the <HI>Apocrypha</HI> story of <HI>Susanna</HI> vers: 50. But <HI>H: Stephanus, tom:</HI> 3. <HI>pag:</HI> 545. makes a doubt whether it should not bee written in that signification <GAP DESC="foreign">, and sup|pose it be to be read there <GAP DESC="foreign">, yet that Geek is not so old as <HI>Paul,</HI> for it is ascribed to <HI>Theodotio,</HI> as M^r. <HI>Seldon</HI> tells us in that place last cited out of him. Yea, the Jesuits of the English Colledge of <HI>Doway</HI> in their Bible acknowledge, that this story <HI>is translated out of Theodotions edition,</HI> and this is the oldest Ori|ginall which they can alledge for it. And besides this it may
<PB N="100" REF="59">
be understood of the Assembly of Elders, when the Elders say to <HI>Daniel,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, which those Jesuits of <HI>Doway</HI> render thus, <HI>because God hath given thee the honour of old age.</HI> Others the honour of an Elder, or an ancient. But I know no reason why the word may not here signifie there As|sembly of Elders. <HI>God hath given thee the Assembly of Elders,</HI> that is, God hath given thee thy petition, and thy desire, which was the meeting again of the Assembly of Elders, as is plaine by the verses preceeding: Even as God gave to his praying children this present Parliament,</P>
<P>2. If the Apostle had meant to expresse the dignity or degree of an Elder, hee would rather have used the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <GAP DESC="foreign">, which Greek writers use <HI>pro senum honore vel dignitate,</HI> then <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is not used in that sence.</P>
<P>3. And if he had meant to stirre up <HI>Timothy</HI> from the ho|nour or dignity of that office and degree, which was conferred upon him he had rather mentioned the degree of an Evangelist, than of an Elder. Even as he saith to him else where, doe the work of an Evangelist.</P>
<P>4. The very Popish Interpreters are forced to confesse that the Apostle means an Assembly of Elders, <HI>Plurium Presbyte|rorum,</HI> saith <HI>Mariana: caetus Presbyterorum,</HI> saith <HI>Salmeron&punc; Esthius</HI> upon the place noteth, that imposition of hands, was <HI>&agrave; pluribus adhibita,</HI> according to that Canon of <HI>Carthage. Hu|go Cardinalis,</HI> noteth here the great honour of Presbyters, that three of them at least, laid on hands in Ordination.</P>
<P>Wherefore I can see no sense which can agree to the Text, but that which is the ordinary and known sense of the word; <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is an Assembly of Elders. In which sense it is al|so frequently used by ancient writers, whereof, he that will, may read good store of examples in <HI>D. Blondelli Apollogia pro sententia Hieronymi.</HI> pag: 89 90.</P>
<P>It hath been objected by some, that 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 4. 14. holds
<PB N="101" REF="59">
forth no president for ordinary Presbyteries, because 1. Here is mention of prophesie which was an extraordinary thing, 2. <HI>Timothy,</HI> was ordained by the laying on of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> his hands, 2. <HI>Tim:</HI> 1. 6. Lastly <HI>Timothy</HI> was an Evangelist, and how could a Presbyter ordain an Evangelist?</P>
<P><HI>Answ:</HI> 1. Those very things which are objected, to depresse the Presbyterie, doe put upon it so much the more aboundant honour. Altho prophesies had gone before concerning <HI>Ti|mothy,</HI> and some extraordinar predictions, 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 1. 18. Altho likewise the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> himself is supposed to have been pre|sent, and to have laid on hands at the sametime, yet neither the extraordinary prophesies, nor the laying on of the hands of an Apostle, did swallow up, take away or hinder the ordinary power and right of the Presbyterie, to be acted and put forth in the ordaining of <HI>Timothy,</HI> or did exempt <HI>Timothy</HI> from en|tring by that ordinary doore, and passage, through those or|dinary hands of the Presbytery.</P>
<P>2. 'Tis not certaine, that either the propheticall predicti|ons concerning <HI>Timothy,</HI> (which the Apostle calls <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>praegress as,</HI> or <HI>quae praecesserunt</HI>) or the laying on of <HI>Pauls</HI> hands, was at the same time with the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie. But whether these things were done together, or at severall times, 'tis very observable, that to these the A|postle prefixeth <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>by,</HI> but to the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>with,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 1. 6. <HI>that thou stirre up the gift which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.</HI> 1 Tim: 4. 14. <HI>the gift which was given thee by prophesie:</HI> then he addeth <HI>with</HI> (not <HI>by</HI>) <HI>the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie:</HI> By this change of the phrase on purpose intimating, that the prophesie and laying on of <HI>Pauls</HI> hands, were things extraordinary, because by these the gift, aptitude, and ability of parts, or the <GAP DESC="foreign"> was given to <HI>Timothy,</HI> but the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie, was according to the ordinary rule then and there
<PB N="102" REF="60">
setled, being a rite used in Ordination, so that <HI>Timothy</HI> had not by the act of the Presbyterie, any gift or <GAP DESC="foreign">, but the <GAP DESC="foreign"> or a potestative, authoritative Ministeriall Mission (for to what other use or end could there bee a laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie?) Therefore <HI>Athanasius</HI> in <HI>apologia ad Imper: Con|stantium</HI> citing this Text, and applying it to ordinary Mini|sters, he lives out that part concerning prophesie, and the rest of the Text he applies thus, <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>The Apostle Paul hath commanded each one of us in his disciple, saying, neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given unto thee with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</HI></P>
<P>3. If it be said that the laying on of the hands of the Pres|bytery was onely to shew their consent, and joyning in pray|er, and hearty wishes with the Apostle for <HI>Timothy:</HI> The answer is ready; let these who alledge this shew us from Scrip|ture, where laying on of hands was ever used, for a bare testi|mony of consent, or of joynt prayers and wishes. I know imposition of hands hath been used in prayers, of blessing, or benediction by such as had a speciall power, authority and priviledge, as <HI>Gen:</HI> 48. <HI>Iacob</HI> when hee blessed the sonnes of <HI>Ioseph,</HI> laid his hands upon them, but we read not that <HI>Ioseph,</HI> or any other, whose heart joyned in prayer and hearty wishes for them, did therefore lay on hands together with <HI>Iacob, Mat.</HI> 19. 15. <HI>Mark:</HI> 10. 16. When Christ blessed the little children, he laid his hands upon them: But will any man imagine, that they who brought the children to be blessed by him, did toge|ther with him lay their hands upon them? And generally if we consider the use of laying on hands in Scripture, wee must conclude that the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, was an authoritative act, not a testimony of consenting and joyning onely.</P>
<P>4. 'Tis thought by some Episcopall writers, that <HI>Timothy</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="60">
was twise ordained, first to be a Presbyter, and after to bee a Bishop. See the history of Episcopacy, <HI>pag,</HI> 117. I should rather say, peradventure he was first ordained a Presbyter, by the Presbyterie. And after ordained an Evangelist by the Apo|stle <HI>Paul.</HI> However the Presbyteries act needs to be extended no further, but to the ordaining him a Presbyter, what was more, (<HI>viz.</HI> Ordination to the office of an Evangelist,) might proceed from the Apostle: I mean, suppose he was ordained once, both Presbyter and Evangelist, and that both the Apo|stle, and Presbyter did lay on their hands together, in this mixed action, we may very well distinguish what was ordi|nary, what was extraordinary, ascribing that to the Presby|tery, this to the Apostle.</P>
<P>5. And if the Presbyterie had ordained, and sent forth <HI>Ti|mothy</HI> as an Evangelist, what inconsistency, or absurdity had been in it? You will object the lesse is blessed of the greater, and not the greater of the lesse, <HI>Heb:</HI> 7. 7. I answer, although <HI>Ti|mothy</HI> as an Evangelist, was greater then a single Presbyter, yet that proves not, that he was (even in that capacity,) greater then the whole presbytery, one of the house of Lords, is great|er then one of the house of Commons, but he is not therefore greater then the house of Commons. When a King and his people is compared together, we use to say, that he is <HI>major singulis, minor universis.</HI> Moreover, he that blesseth, is not e|very way greater then he who is blessed, but he is greater <HI>qua talis,</HI> in so far as he blesseth. And why might not the Presby|tery be greater then an Evangelist, not simply and absolutly, but in so farre as they blessed and ordained him. So <HI>Ananias</HI> put his hands upon <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 9. 17. and afterwards certain Prophets and Teachers at <HI>Anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ch</HI> laid hands on him, and <HI>Bar|nabas, Acts</HI> 13. 1, 3. And in so farre there was a majo|rity and preeminence in those who laid on their hands though simply and absolutly they were the greater, on
<PB N="104" REF="61">

<P>This takes off some of the chief exceptions brought by the Author of the Queries concerning Ordination, <HI>quest:</HI> 19. which done, his other exceptions are the more easily mastered. He himself passeth from one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hem, as not being very consi|derable, <HI>viz.</HI> that Presbyterie there is used to signifie not a com|pany of Elders, but the Ordinance or office it self.

<P>The other is a conjecture of his own, which if it be a light, I confesse it is a new light. <HI>It seemes more probable</HI> (saith he) <HI>be farre that when</HI> Paul <HI>laid his hands on</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">imothy, 2 Tim: 1. 6. <HI>there were some other Apostles, or Apostles fellowes that joyned with him in that action. And that Apostles should be called Presb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ters or El|ders, and a company of them a Presbytery or Eldership, is an expres|sion consonant to other Scriptures where the appellation of Elder is attributed unto them,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet:</HI> 5 1. 2. <HI>Epist: Ioh:</HI> 1. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 3 <HI>Epist:</HI> 1. <HI>Ans:</HI> 1 In the last two Scriptures which he citeth, the word Elder is a name of age not of office, and we are to understand, <GAP DESC="foreign"> in those places to be only a degree more then <GAP DESC="foreign">: <HI>Epist,</HI> to <HI>Philemon. v.</HI> 9. <HI>Paul the aged,</HI> So <HI>Iohn the elder. i. e.</HI> now full of yeares and very old.

For as <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">cumenius</HI> upon the place te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s us, <HI>Peter</HI> cals himself so for modesties cause, and the better to enforce the following exhortation, that the Elders should not lift up themselves a|bove others, as he did not lift up himself above them. Sure
<PB N="105" REF="61">
<HI>Apostles and Elders</HI> were ordinarly distinguishing names, as it is manifest from <HI>Act.</HI> 15. 2. 4. 6. 22: 23. Why then would the Querist leave the ordinary Scripture notion of the word, <HI>Elder,</HI> and ground his own interpretation of the word Presbyterie, upon <HI>Peters</HI> calling himself an Elder: he might als well argue, that the believing Romans who are called the servants of God, <HI>Rom:</HI> 6. 22. or these believing Strangers who have the same name, 1 <HI>Pet:</HI> 2. 16. were Apostles, and that we are to understand by the servants of God in these Texts, Apostles, because <HI>Tit:</HI> 1. 1. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> calleth himself a servant of God. By the like Logick he may argue that the ordaining of Elders, <HI>Act:</HI> 14. 23. <HI>Tit:</HI> 1 5. is meant of ordaining Apostles, because the Scrip|ture calls the Apostles Elders. 3. <HI>Peter</HI> calls not himselfe <GAP DESC="foreign">, an Elder, but <GAP DESC="foreign">. The sense of the word is ex|plained two wayes, both are mentioned by H. <HI>Stephanus</HI> in <HI>Thes: ling: Gr: Tom:</HI> 3, <HI>pag:</HI> 545. and both of them make against that which this Querist drives at. First the sense is conceived to be this, <HI>qui sum &amp; ipse Presbyter:</HI> so the Tigurine, <HI>who am also an Elder</HI> so the English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ranslators. Now the Text running thus, <HI>The Elders who are among you I exhort, who am also an Elder, i. e.</HI> I who give this exhortation unto you Elders, as I am an Apostle, so my Apostleship doth not exclude me from being one of you, for I am also an Elder: Thus (I say) this very Text makes against the Querist, for even here we see that they who were commonly called Elders, were not Apostles. But there is a second sense, which maks yet more against the Querist: For <HI>H. Stephanus</HI> expresseth the sense of <GAP DESC="foreign"> thus, <HI>qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &amp; ipse &egrave; seniorum &amp; Presbyterorum Collegio est,</HI> he who is of the Assembly or Colledge of Elders commonly called the Pres|bytery: <HI>Hierome</HI> did happily intend the same thing by the word <HI>Compresbyter.</HI> And likewise <HI>Beza</HI> by his rendering <HI>ego una Pres|byter, i. e.</HI> I who am together with you a Presbyter, or you and I being Presbyters all of us together. And so the Text
<PB N="106" REF="62">
may be red thus, <HI>The Elders who are among you I exhort, who am also of your Presbyteries.</HI> There were Presbyteries among them, or Assemblies of Elders properly so called, and of these Presbyteries <HI>Peter</HI> was also a member, and when he was pre|sent in any of the Presbyteries in <HI>Pontus, Gallacia, Capadocia, Asia,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ythinia,</HI> he joyned and acted as an Elder, and as in a Presbytery.

For the name <HI>Presbyterie</HI> being purposely chosen in this Text, which mentions laying on of hands in Ordination, will prove that the Apostles did these as Elders, and as an act of one Assembly of Elders, not as any thing peculiar to the Apostles. For no rationall man will imagine, that the holy Ghost intending to expresse some extraordinary thing, which the Apostles did as Apostles, and which belongs not to ordinary Elders, would in that very thing purposely call them <GAP DESC="foreign"> or an Assembly of Elders. 5. That <GAP DESC="foreign"> here is not an Assembly of Apostles, but of
<PB N="108" REF="63">
Elders who were not Apostles may appear plainly by compa|ring the Text now in controversie with 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 1. 6. <HI>the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</HI> If an Assembly of Apostles had laid hands on <HI>Timothy,</HI> and so joyned in that action with <HI>Paul,</HI> as the Querist supposeth, <HI>Paul</HI> had not thus distinguished his laying on of hands, from that of his fellow Apostles, as if the gifts of the holy Ghost had been given to <HI>Timothy</HI> only by the laying of his hands, and not <HI>by,</HI> but <HI>with</HI> the laying on of the hands of his fellow Apostles&punc; Of this diffe|rence of the phrase in the one Text and in the other, I have spo|ken before, which indeed fitly expresseth the difference be|twixt the laying of <HI>Pauls</HI> hands, and the laying on of the Elders hands, but there could be no such difference among the Apo|stles themselves, or Apostles fellowes.</P>
<P>But I have not yet done with the vindication and clearing of this Text, which holds forth a president for ordination by a Presbytery. It may bee further objected, 1. If this Text must be understood of Ordination by a Presbytery, then the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery is necessary to Ordi|nation; and then, what shall become of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">se who were not or|dained by a Pressbytery; and what shall also become of that which so many protestant writers have pleaded against the Popish Sacrament of Orders: <HI>viz.</HI> that the rite or signe in Or|dination, <HI>i.e.</HI> imposition of hands, is not instituted or command|ed by Christ or his Apostles?</P>
<P>To the first I answer, 1. although I hold the Imposition of the hands of the Presbytery to be no Sacrament, nor efficaci|ous and operative for giving of the holy Ghost, as the laying on of the Apostles hands was: nor, 2. necessary to Ordination, <HI>necessitate medii vel finis,</HI> as if Ordination were void and no Or|dination without it, or as if they who were not ordained with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, were therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o be thought unordained, or unministeriated: Although like|wise
<PB N="109" REF="63">
3. I do not hold the laying on of hands to be the sub|stantiall part or act of Ordination (which I have before prooved to be essentiall to the calling of a Minister) but only the rituall part in Ordination. And although, 4. I hold the laying on of hands to be such a rite, whereunto we ought to be very sparing to ascribe mysterious significations, wherein some have gone too farre, and taken too much liberty, yet I hold (with the ge|nerality of prot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">stant writers, and with the best refo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">med Churches) that the laying on of hands is to be still retained in Ordination. I hold also that this laying on of hands is an Ordi|nance of the new Testament (and so do our dissenting Bre|thren of the Independent way hold also) and that 'tis necessa|ry by the necessity of precept, and Institution, and in point of duety. <HI>For although there is no certain precept extant, concerning laying on of hands, yet because we see the Apostles did alwayes use it, their so ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">urat observing of it ought to be unto us in stead of a Pre|cept,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aith <HI>Calvin Instit. lib:</HI> 4. <HI>cap:</HI> 31, &sect; 6.

The laying on of the hands of the Apostles in so far as the holy Ghost was given thereby, was extraordinary, and ceased with themselves, yet in so far as the Apostles, yea and the Presby|tery too, laid on hands in their ordaining of Ministers, there is a standing reason why we should do in like maner: the laying on of hands being a rite properly belonging to the praying over these whom we blesse in the name of the Lord, with an autho|ritative benediction, as is manifest by these examples of laying on of hands, in <HI>Iacobs</HI> blessing of <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Manasseh.

'Tis one thing to dispute of the absolute soveraigne power of God, and what are the truths, without the beleif whereof 'tis absolutly, and altogether impossible that one can be saved: Which question (I doubt) is hardly determinable by Scripture, nor do I know what edification there is in the canvassing of it&punc; sure I am 'tis a question much abused. 'Tis another thing to dispute what are these truths, which in a Church where the Gospell is truely preached, all and every one, (come to years of knowledge and discretion) and having means and occasions to learne, are bound to know, (and according to the revealed will and ordinary dispensation of God) must learne, as they desire or exspect to have a true fellowship with Christ in the Sacra|ment of the Lords supper, or to bee accepted of God, and sa|ved eternally:

<P>From all which Scripturall observations we may make up a description of Heresie, to this sense. <HI>Heresie is agrosse and dangerous errour voluntarily held, and factiously maintained by some person or persons within the visible Church, in opposition to some chief or substantiall truth or truths grounded upon and drawn from the holy Scripture by necessary consequence.</HI></P>

<P>If therefore they must be Heresies even for this reason, to make more manifest who are approved, who not: Then let no thoughts arise in our hearts, toward the accusing of divine providence in this particular. <HI>Iustin Martyr. Quaest, &amp; respons: ad orthod. quaest.</HI></P>
<P>1. Answering this doubt: If God hath taken away the Idolatries, superstitious, and false religion of Heathens, and
<PB N="119" REF="68">
hath also abolished the Jewish worship, why hath he suffered Heresies to enter into the Christian Church? Hee gives this solution, that although Heresies come into the Church through mens negligence, and flothfulnesse, (for while men slept, the enemy sowed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ares among the wheat, <HI>Mat:</HI> 13. 25:) Yet the providence of God was no way slothfull in the businesse, for he foresaw, and foretold that Heresies should come, and hath given plaine warning in his word concerning the same. He addeth that the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">me God who did destroy the Heathenish and the Jewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h religion, will also destroy Heresies, after hee hath suffered them for a time. Although wee had no distinct knowledge, what God intends to work out of Heresies, yet we ought not to censure, but humbly, and reverently, to adore Gods most wise, and most holy, (though secret and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">earchable) dispensations. If wee should see somewhat which is deadly poyson among some drugges, which a skilled and approved Physitian is making use of, wee must not rushly censure the Phisitian, for hee knowes how to disabuse that which is in it self poysonable, and to make it one of the ingredients in a most soveraigne medicine. Or if we should come into the shop of a curious Artificer, or I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">geneer, and there see some ugly and ill favoured instruments, which we think can serve for no good but for evill, yet it were foolishly done to censure the Artificer, who knowes to make an excellent good use of these things, though we know not. How much more foolish and sinfull is it, to suffer thoughts to rise in our hearts against the wisdome and providence of God, even alth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ugh wee know not what he intends to work out of such things? We were most of all inexcusable to accuse his providence, now when he hath made known in his word to us, that by occasion of Heresies, he will make manifest who are approved, who not. <HI>Wherefore</HI> (saith <HI>Chryso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ome, de divers&punc;</HI> &amp;c. <HI>tom: loc: Ser:</HI> 21.) <HI>that no man might say, why hath Christ permitted this,</HI> Paul <HI>saith, this permission</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="69">
<HI>shall not hurt thee, if thou art one who are approved, for by this means thou shalt be made more manifest.</HI> Yet all this cannot ex|cuse, either the Hereticks, or Sectaries themselves, or these who connive at them, for that which Christ saith <HI>in genere</HI> of scan|dals, is true <HI>in specie</HI> of Heresies, it must needs be that Heresies come, but woe be to him by whom they come, I adde, and woe also to him who doth not according to his place and cal|ling, endevour the extirpation of them. The Text which I now speak to, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. 17. hath not reference to the will of Gods commandement, which is the rule of our duty, but to the will of Gods decree, or the secret counsell of his will. 'Tis Gods purpose to permit Heresies, and to over rule them for this end; that his graces in his children may the more shine forth, and that even Heresies (contrarie to the intentions of Sathan and Hereticks) may make manifest who are approved, <HI>scilicet quos non potuerint depravare,</HI> saith <HI>Tertullian,</HI> opening this Scripture. <HI>De praescr: adv: haer:</HI> to wit (saith he) <HI>such as He|resies could not pervert and deprave,</HI> no other are the approved ones.</P>
<P>But there are two things may be here objected: 1. May not one chosen and justified, and regenerat be drawn away, and infected with Heresie through the flight of men, and cunning craftinesse, whereby they lie in wait to deceave? If so, then Heresies, doe not make manifest who are approved. who not. 2&punc; May not many who are not approved of God be preserved from the infections of Heresies; Yea, be forward in resisting and opposing them? If so, then preservation from, and resisting of Heresies cannot make manifest that one is ap|proved of God. These objections are no more against mee, then against the Text of Scripture. To the first, I answere, a regenerat person may be tempted and drawn over to Here|sie, as he may be tempted and drawen over to other great sins. Heresie doth no otherwise consist with the state of grace in any
<PB N="121" REF="69">
person, then other works of the flesh, adultery, fornication, drunkennesse, or the like. Look upon an elect and justified person, while lying in some great sinne, for instance, <HI>Noah, Lot, David, Peter,</HI> even so must ye look upon an elect and justified person poysoned with Heresie. But then that person being ele|cted, justified and regenerate, cannot be supposed to live &amp; die in that sinfull estate, but God will certainely heal his backslidings, and rescue his soul out of the snare of the devill by repentance, for the elect cannot be deceived, so as to continue and die in a Heresie, <HI>Mat:</HI> 24. 24. And while he continueth in such a grosse sin or Heresie, you may truely say, that for that time he is <GAP DESC="foreign">, unapproved, or like drosse and unrefined silver, in which sens the word is used by the Apostle, where he speaks of his bringing his body into subjection, lest he himself should be found <GAP DESC="foreign">, where the old English translation readeth, <HI>Lest I my self should be reprooved,</HI> which is too soft a word. The new Translation hath, <HI>Lest I my self should be a cast away.</HI> Beza, <HI>ne ipse rejectaneus fiam.</HI> In the same sense tis used, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 5. <HI>Know you not your own selves, how that Iesus Christ is in you except ye be re|probats.</HI> Beza, <HI>nisi rejectanei estis. H. Stephanus</HI> expones, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>minime probus non probandus: Item adulterinus non sincerus,</HI> and he cites <HI>Aristotle,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. In this sense even an e|lect and regenerat person supposed to be a maintainer or fol|lower of Here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e (while such) is certainly, <GAP DESC="foreign">, unapproved, greatly reproveable, to be rejected and cast away to the for|nace like drossie and unrefined silver, and no marvel, for in that estate he doth not act his graces but his corruptions, and by his great sin doth extreamly grieve and dangerously quench the holy Spirit once given to him.</P>
<P>To the other objection I answer, First, Although the full and perfect discovery (who are approved, who not) is reserved to the great and last day, and there is no company, Assembly, nor visible Church in this world, without a mixture of Hypo|crites,
<PB N="122" REF="70">
yet surely the word of the Lord hath been and shall be so far fulfilled, that in a great measure and according to the knowledge which the church can have of her members in this life, there is in times of Heresies and Schismes a discovery made who are the approved Ones, who not. 2. We must re|member tis not the scope of this Text to give us a note of di|stinction between these who are approved, and all counterfits or unapproved Christians, but between these who are appro|ved, and these who are the fomenters or followers of Heresies. Thus they who are indeed approved of God continue in the truth of Christ, grounded and setled, and stand fast in the faith and contend for it: and this is one of the characters, found in all such as are approved. And thus far, saith <HI>Augustine,</HI> are He|reticks profitable to the Church, for by their meanes, those<NOTE PLACE="marg">August. Tom. 1. lib de vera re|lig. cap. 8. sunt enim innume|rabiles in Ecclesia sancta, Deo pro|bati vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">i, sed ma nifesti non fiunt inter nos, quam diu imperitiae nostrae te|nebris de|lectatidor|mire ma|lumus, quam luce~ veritatis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ntueri.</NOTE> who are approved of God and spiritual men, are stirred up to vindicat, open, and hold foorth the truth, whereby they be|come more manifest then otherwise they could have been. Upon the other part, who ever turne away from the truth, and from the Doctrine of Christ, and turne aside after Here|sies, do thereby infalliblely declare themselves to be unap|proved, whatsoever profession or shew of holine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e they have: Whatsoever become of the white mark of these who are ap|proved (which also holds true as I have explained it) most certainly, this black mark cannot fail upon the other side, and he who supposeth any person who is of a Hereticall belief and faction, to be holy, spirituall, mortified, and approved, or one that walketh in the spirit, and not in the flesh, doth but sup|pose that which is impossible. And I do not doubt, but God is (by the Heresies and Schismes of these times) making a disco|very of many unapproved, unmortified Professors, who pre|tended to Piety. So that I may transferre to our time what <HI>Chrysostome</HI> observed of his owne, <HI>lib.</HI> 1 <HI>ad eos qui scandali|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ati sunt. cap.</HI> 19. <HI>How many are there clothed with a shadow and</HI>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of new Lights, and how to keep off from splitting either upon the Charybdis of pertinacy and tenaciousnesse, or upon the Scylla of Levity, Wavering and Scepticisme.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_TIs pleaded by some who pretend to more tendernesse of conscience then others, that to establish by the Law of the Land a Confession of Faith, or a Dire|ctory of the worship of God, and of the Govern|ment of the Church, and to appoint penalties or punishments upon such as maintaine the contrary Doctrines or practises,
<PB N="124" REF="71">
is to hold out and shut the doore upon new Light. That as the State and Church hath discovered the evill of diverse things, which were sometime approved and strengthned by the Law of the Land, so there may be afterwards a discovery made by the light of Experience, and a further search of the Scripture, to make manifest the falshood of those Doctrines which are now received as true, and the evil of that Government and way which is now imbraced as good, for <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>For satisfaction in this difficulty, First of all, I do not deny but most willingly yeeld, yea assert as a necessary truth, that as our knowledge (at its best in this world) is imperfect, (for we know but in part) so it ought to be our desire and endea|vour to grow in the knowledge of the minde of Christ, to follow on to know the Lord, to seek after more and more light, <HI>for the path of the Iust is as the shyning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day, Prov.</HI> 4. 18. Secondly, I ac|knowledge that this imperfection of our knowledge, is not only in degrees, but in parts, that is, we may know afterwards not only more of that good, or evill, or truth, or error, of which we knew somewhat before, but we may happily come to know the evill of that whereof we knew no evill before, or the good of that in which we knew no good before, so may we come to know diverse truths which before we knew not. Thirdly, I acknowledge there is not only this imperfection, but oft times a great mistake, misunderstanding, error, and un|soundnesse in the judgement of Christian persons or Church|es, so that godly men and true Churches may come to know that to be evil which they sometime thought good, and that to be false which sometime they thought true, or contrariwise. Which experience hath taught, and may teach again. Fourthly, I confesse it is no shame for an <HI>Augustine</HI> to writ a Book of Re|tractations. It is the duty, not only of particular Christians, but of reforming, yea reformed, yea the best reformed Churh|es,
<PB N="125" REF="71">
whensoever any error in their doctrine, or any evill in their Government or forme of worship, shall be demonstrated to them from the word of God, (although it were by one single person, and one perhaps of no great reputation for parts or learning, like <HI>Paphnu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ius</HI> among the many learned Bishops in the counsell of <HI>Nice</HI>) to take in and not to shut out further light: to imbrace the will of Christ held foorth unto them, and to amend what is amisse, being discovered unto them. Fifthly, I also believe that towards the evening of the world, there shall be more light, and knowledge shall be increased, <HI>Dan:</HI> 12. 4. and many hid things in Scripture better understood, when the Jewes shall be brought home, and the Spirit of grace and illumina|tion more aboundantly powred foorth. We have great cause to long and pray for the conversion of the Jewes, surely we shall be much the better of them.</P>
<P>But on the other hand, the greatest deceits and depths of Sathan have been brought into the world, under the name or notion of new Lights. Did not the serpent beguile <HI>Evah</HI> with this notion of a new light, <HI>Gen:</HI> 3. 5? Which example the Apostle setteth before our eyes, 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. 3 plainly warning us that Sathan is transformed into an Angell of light, and his apostles into the Apostles of Christ, <HI>vers.</HI> 13. 14. So <HI>Rev:</HI> 2. 2. Did not <HI>Ieroboam</HI> make <HI>Israel</HI> to sin by a false new Light? <HI>It is too much for you to go up to Ierusalem, behold thy Gods, O Isra|el, &amp;c.</HI> 1. <HI>Kings.</HI> 12. 28. He would shew to the ten Tribes, how they might in all matters of Religion be independent upon Je|rusalem; howbeit (to note that by the way) he did not erect Independent Churches, without an Independent Common|wealth. He would shew them also that they were abused with a pretended sacred order of the Priests, the Ministers of the Lord, therefore no <HI>jure divino</HI> men, but Ministers dependent, 2 <HI>Chron:</HI> 11. 14. 15. And so he would needs make Priests of the lowest of the people, <HI>vers.</HI> 31. for all which he had a pre|tence
<PB N="126" REF="72">
of power or liberty from God, 1 <HI>Kings,</HI> 11. 37. His new light made an Independent Church, and a dependent Ministery. The <HI>Gnosticks</HI> had their name from the profound knowledge and greater light which they pretended to, above all others, yet the ancient writers tell us they were but a prophane Sect. <HI>Maho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">et</HI> himself pretended that the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> taught him his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> that so he might purchase the greater credit to it.</P>
<P>Now tis to be observed, there are many cautions necessary, and that there is much to be said against many of these things which now goe under the name of new Lights among those who plead for Liberty of conscience.</P>
<P>New Light is now become a beguiling Word, as once a|mong the <HI>Graecians,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, a new swallow. A beguiling word, I may wel cal it, for most of those things which are now cried up as new lights, are neither lights nor new. Not lights, because not according to the word from whence all true light must be derived. Not new, because the very same things have been before moved and maintained, <HI>Antinomianisme, Ana|baptisme,</HI> universall atonement by the death of Christ, univer|sall salvation, a temporall and earthly kingdome of Christ, and the Saints liberty of conscience &amp;c. have been maintained and confuted also before this age. Independency it self, if it be a light, yet it is no new one lately struck out, for it was long since a known tenent of the <HI>Arminians,</HI> that Synods or Coun|sels ought only to debate, deliberat, consult, and advise, but not to exercise any Jurisdiction, to inflict any censure, or to in|joyn any thing under pain of censure. See the propositions of|fered by the <HI>Arminians</HI> in the 25th <HI>Session</HI> of the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Dort.</HI> See also <HI>Episcopii disp: Theol: part:</HI> 2 <HI>disp:</HI> 54. <HI>Thes:</HI> 9, 10. <HI>&amp; part</HI> 3, <HI>disp:</HI> 32, <HI>thes:</HI> 4. 5, 11. But I come to the particular cautions concerning new Lights.</P>
<P>First, it is but a false new light which expelleth not only the old darknesse, but much of the good old light. As in Medecins

the Paracelsian way is most dangerous when it is destructive to the Galenik way, and overthroweth the old approved principles, yet tis of very good use when prudently, and skil|fully managed, for perfecting the <HI>Galenik</HI> way, and for doing things more speedily, easily, and pleasantly, than the <HI>Galenik</HI> way could doe: So in Divinity, such new Lights as do not expell, but retaine, improve, and perfect the old, may be of singular good use: but those new Lights which are destructive and expulsive of the old true Lights, those new wayes which lead us away from the old and the good way, are to be utterly disliked and avoided, 2 <HI>Epist:</HI> of <HI>Iohn</HI> vers: 8. <HI>Look to your selves, that we lose not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">se things which we have gained.</HI> Hee speaks it against those deceavers who would have seduced them from the Doctrine of Christ, as is evident both from the preceeding <HI>vers</HI> and from that which followeth: <HI>Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, hath not God, &amp;c</HI> Rom. 16. 17. <HI>Now I beseech you brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.</HI> A Bishop, saith Paul, <HI>must hold fast the faithfull word, as he hath been taught,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">it&punc; 1. 9.

<PB N="128" REF="73">
Apostolicall rules, are very far contrary to the <HI>Accademicall;</HI> yea, <HI>Pyrrhonian</HI> demurre and dubitation, by which some call in question the most received Doctrines in the Christian Church. If <HI>Skepticisme</HI> bee tollerable in the Christian faith, why are we bidden <HI>stand fast in the faith,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 16. 13. and again <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 23. <HI>let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wa|vering?</HI> And why did Jesus Christ himselfe write to those who had not receaved the false Doctrines of that time, that which ye have already, hold fast till I come, <HI>Rev:</HI> 2. 24? It was a fowle error in <HI>Balaam</HI> the false Prophet, that after God had said to him concerning <HI>Balaks</HI> messengers, <HI>Thou shall not goe with them, thou shall not curse the people, for they are blessed, Num:</HI> 22 12. yet at the next sending of Messengers, he would needs seek (forsooth) a new Light from God, <HI>vers:</HI> 18. 19. <HI>If Balak would give me his housefull of silver and gold, I cannot goe beyond the word of the Lord my God, to do lesse or more Now therefore I pray you, tarry yee also here this night, that I may know what the Lord will say unto mee more.</HI> God gave him a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">w light indeed, but in wrath and judgement, quite extinguishing and expelling judicially that light which the false Prophet himself had not intertained, but wickedly forsaken, <HI>vers:</HI> 20. <HI>And God came to</HI> Balaam <HI>at night, and said unto him, if the men come to call thee, rise up and goe with them.</HI> Behold the fruit of not entertaining light, once received from God. So likewise the young Prophet, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 13. for not holding fast what he had receaved from God but taking in a new false light from the old Prophet, was most exemplarly and severly punished for it. This is the first caution most necessary for the Sectaries of this time, whose new lights are such, that among them <HI>vetera deperdita,</HI> and <HI>nova reperta,</HI> go hand in hand together, and are almost convertible termes, as if a man should not keep what he had, because he finds somewhat which he had not.</P>
<P>Secondly, many of those new lights which some brag off,
<PB N="129" REF="73">
not onely expell much of the good old light, but bring in grosse Egyptian darknesse. There is a woe denounced against those who put <HI>darknesse for light,</HI> as well as against those who put <HI>light for darknesse, Isay</HI> 5. 20. I may well say, that grosse darknesse is introduced, when the fundamentall Articles of faith are called in question, denied, and oppugned, as the God|head of Jesus Christ, the divine authority of the Scriptures; the immortality of the Soul, the eternity of glory to the Elect, and of torments to the Reprobate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If the foundations be shaken, what can the righteous doe? If wee hold not fast this Gospell, if we embrace not this Saviour, we cannot have another, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 3. 11. <HI>For other foundation can no man lay, then that is laid, which is Iesus Christ,</HI> Gal: 1. 6. <HI>I marvell that ye are so soone removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another Gospell,</HI> vers, 8. <HI>But though we or an Angel from heaven preach any other Gospell unto you, then that which wee have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, beware of those new Lights, which make any cer|tain truth (although neither fundamentall, nor circumfun|damentall) to be uncertaine, as wee ought not to say of any sin, so neither of any truth: <HI>Is it not a little one?</HI> Let every truth be highly valued. Buy the truth, and sell it not; say not, This truth is but a matter of discipline, let it goe, 'ts not worth the buying? <HI>He that is faithfull in that which is least, is faithfull also in much: and he that is un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ust in the least, is unjust also in much, Luke</HI> 16. 10. <HI>Melchior Adamus,</HI> both in the life of <HI>Carolostadius,</HI> and in the life of <HI>Luther,</HI> observeth the great evill which grew out of <HI>Luthers</HI> dislike of <HI>Carolostadius,</HI> his strictnesse, zeal, and forewardnesse, in abolishing auricular confession, and difference of meats, and casting out images out of Churches, at which things <HI>Luther</HI> was the more offended, because done by <HI>Caro|lostadius</HI> in <HI>Wittenbreg,</HI> during <HI>Luthers</HI> absence, and without his knowledge and counsell. <HI>Luther</HI> did also alledge that <HI>Caro|lostadius,</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="74">
his strictnesse and zeal in these lesser things, hindered and retarded the Reformation in more substantiall points of Doctrine. However the story noteth, that hence was the first rise of that deplorable Sacramentarian controversie, which hath ever since made so great a rupture in <HI>Germany.</HI> I could never yet observe, or read, or hear of controversies about dis|cipline in any Christian Church, but still they grew higher and higher, and those who rejected, or slighted the will of Christ in smaller things, did afterwards slight it in greater things.</P>
<P>Fourthly, beware of those new lights, which not only re|fuse to admit some certaine truths, but refuse to admit any truth, now held or professed in the reformed Churches, as sure and certaine and infallible, as if, because mens judgements are not infallible, but subject to error, therefore, wee cannot be sure, nor infallibly perswaded of this or that Article. The holy Scripture will teach us, that beleevers may attaine to a certaine and infallible knowledge of some truths, for it was no impossible thing that <HI>Paul</HI> prayed for, when he prayed that the <HI>Colossians</HI> might have <HI>all riches of the full assurance of under|standing, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ.</HI> The mystery of God that he is, and that he is eternall, invisible, omnipotent, <HI>&amp;c:</HI> his nature, and attributes, the mystery of the Father, or that there is a distin|ction of persons in the holy Trinity, and an eternall generati|on, the mystery of Christ, his person, natures, offices, birth, passion, death, resurrection, ascension, and intercession: these are things of which the Apostle would have us most fully and certainly perswaded. <HI>Timothy</HI> was assured of the things he had learned, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 14. so was <HI>Theophilus, Luke.</HI> 1. 4. A Mari|ner is not infallible in his judgement, yet hee may bee assured infallibly, that such a thing is a rocke which he must avoid, and such a way, is the way he must direct his course: A Physitian is
<PB N="131" REF="74">
not infallible in his judgement concerning the symptomes, causes and cures of diseases, yet he may be most certainly per|swaded, such a disease is deadly, and there is no cure for it, or such a thing may be cured, and this is the cure. So in Divinty the obnoxiousnesse of mens judgement to error hindereth not, but they may be infallibly perswaded of this, and this, and the other truth.</P>
<P>Fifthly, beware of those new Lights, which come not from the Sunne of righteousnesse: To the Law and to the testimony, if they speake not according to this word, it is, because there is no light in them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 8. 20. When men walk in the light of their owne sparkes, they shall lye down in darknesse: New fancies are not new lights, 'tis no truth, which cannot bee grounded upon the word of truth?</P>
<P>It was a wilde fancy of the <HI>Weigelians,</HI> that there is a time to come (which they cal <HI>seculum Spiritus sancti,</HI>) in which God shal by his Spirit reveal much more knowledge and light, then was revealed by Christ and his Apostles in the Scriptures. There is so much revealed in Scripture, as the Apostle calls the wis|dome of God, and the hidden wisdome of God, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 2. 7. the things which are preached and written to us, are the things which the very Angels desire to look or pry into, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 12. and saith not Christ; That which ye have already, hold fast till I come, <HI>Revel:</HI> 2. 25? more of this error, see in <HI>Brochm and System. theol: com:</HI> 1. Article 6. <HI>cap:</HI> 2. <HI>quaest:</HI> 12.</P>
<P>Sixtly, take heed of proud, and lofty, and self conceited new Lights, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 32, 33. <HI>And the spirits of the Prophets, are subject to the Prophets; for God is not the author of confusion, but of peace.</HI> If the spirits of the Prophets must be so subject, how much more the spirits of private persons? Wherefore in a reformed Church, all pretended new Lights, which are against the receaved Doctrine, government, or forme of worship, ought to be in all humility and submission, offered to be tryed
<PB N="132" REF="75">
by a learned and godly Synod. The <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rean</HI> severity was such, that no man might move for a new law, but with a rope about his neck, that if his motion were thought good, he might be spa|red: but if bad, hanged. So <HI>Demosthenes advers: Timocr:</HI> tells us. I will not allow this severity against such as offer new Lights, or move for new changes in the Church. But I may well applie here, the <HI>Athenian</HI> law recorded by <HI>Demosthenes</HI> in the same Oration. The <HI>Athenians</HI> went not so farre as the <HI>Locri,</HI> yet no man might move for a new law in <HI>Athens,</HI> unlesse the motion were offered and submitted to the Senat, who were to judge, whether the old or the new were better.</P>
<P>Seventhly, beware of separating new Lights, to separat from, or gather Churches out of the true reformed or reforming Churches, hath not the least warrant from the word of God. When we see this or that amisse in a Church, wee are bidden exhort one another, and provoke one another to good, but not to separate, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 24, 25. <HI>Zuinglius</HI> conferred amicably with the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> in <HI>Zurik,</HI> as with dissenting brethren, and no course was taken to suppresse or restraine them by the secu|lar power, till they grew to gather Churches out of the true re|formed Churches, but when it came to that, they could not be suffered or forborn, it was thought necessary to restrain them.</P>
<P>Eightly, beware of those new Lights which dare not be seen, and are kept up in corners. Truth seeks no corners: light doth not shun light: a candle is not lighted to be put under a bushel, but on a candlestick, <HI>Matth:</HI> 5. 15. 1 <HI>Ioh:</HI> 3. 20, 21. <HI>Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither commeth to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved, but he that doth truth, commeth to the light,</HI> Prov. 4. 19. <HI>The way of the wicked, is as darknesse: they know not at what they stumble.</HI> I adde to make up the <HI>Antithesis</HI> to <HI>vers:</HI> 18. their way is darkened more and more untill the dark night. I have heard when the <HI>Arminians</HI> were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tto it in the Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> to declare their judgement and sense
<PB N="133" REF="75">
which they <HI>would hold at,</HI> they declined it, and <HI>Episcopius</HI> an|swered in the name of the rest, <HI>Dies diem docet.</HI> And is it not so with the Sectaries of this time, from whom you cannot draw a clear modell of what they hold?</P>
<P>Ninthly, refuse such new Lights as have fellowship with the unfruitfull work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of darknesse, <HI>Eph</HI> 5. 11. 'Tis a deceitfull new Light, which makes men forbear to reprove, speak, or pe|tition against those evills in a state which their consciences know to be sinfull, and to wink at such things, as publikly dishonour God in a nation, upon hopes that themselves shall be winked at and tollerated. <HI>But what communion hath light with darknesse,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 14. There are some who pretend to new Light, and to tendernesse of conscience, who yet are con|tent, to combine and associat themselves with those of another and different way, (which themselves condemn as a sinfull way) in that common cause of theirs, for crying up their great <HI>Diana,</HI> liberty of conscience, and for opposing the Church government by Presbyteries and Synods. How they who would not assist the Presbyterians, for the purging of their Congregations, and keep off all scandalous persons from the Sacrament, and yet do assist and strengthen <HI>Separatists, Anabap|tists, Antinomians, Socinians, Erastians, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ekers,</HI> in seeking after tolleration, how (I say) they will answer this to God and their own consciences, let them look to it. Again, many of the pretended new Lights: have communion with darknesse in another respect, because they are borrowed from Heresies, buried in darknesse. How many new Lights are now brought from the <HI>Arrians, Manichees, Novatians, Donatists, the con|templative Monkes</HI> and <HI>Friars,</HI> the <HI>Photinians, Socinians, Ar|minians,</HI> &amp;c. These are no more new Lights, then a beggars cloak is a new garment, being newly made up, out of many old riven and rotten clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ts sowed together.</P>
<P>Tenthly, away with those new Lights which let men see no|thing
<PB N="134" REF="76">
better, which bring no edification, those <HI>Baeoti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> aenigmata,</HI> those none sense and naughty high notions, in which some frothie spirits evanish. <HI>Let all things bee done unto edifying,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 26. There are vaine bablings, and science falsly so called, which hath made men erre from the faith, 1 <HI>Tim</HI> 6. 20, 21.</P>
<P>Lastly, take good heed of those new Lights, which follow new interests. Such was that of <HI>Ieroboam,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 12. 26. to the end; and that of <HI>Balaam; Num:</HI> 22. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. There are some who suppose that gaine is godlinesse, saith the Apostle, 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 6. 5. and so there are some who suppose new interests, to be new Lights.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of Stability and firmnesse in the truth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_IT is good Divinity to maintaine that <HI>Skepticisme,</HI> flu|ctuation and wavering concerning those things which God hath revealed, to be beleeved or done by us, is a sinne: and to bee firme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">xed and established in the truth, to hold fast the profession thereof, to stand fast in the faith, is a duty commanded. I shal first prove it to be so; then give reasons for it, and thirdly, some helps to this duty, and preservatives against this sinne.</P>
<P>For proof of the thing, somewhat might bee said from the very light of nature, for <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">th a nation changed their Gods, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">er:</HI> 2. 11.

They said also, that he who erres or miscarries in his Religion, doth <GAP DESC="foreign">, drink out of a bored or foraminous cup. How firme and constant
<PB N="135" REF="76">
have heathen Philosophers been in maintaining their opinions? they could not onely displease their friends, <HI>amicus Plato,</HI> &amp;c. but suffer the heaviest things for their opinions. And shall not we much more hold fast the profession of the true faith? <HI>Zonar|as Annall, tom:</HI> 3. In the raign of <HI>Michael</HI> the Emperour, the son of <HI>Theophilus,</HI> tels us&punc; that when the sister of the Prince of <HI>Bulgaria</HI> became a Christian, and the Prince also by her means conver|ted, the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ulgarians</HI> conspired against him for this change of Religion. This diabolicall stedfastnesse of theirs, provoked him to a true Christian stedfastnesse, till by Gods assistance and blessing, they were made to turne to him, but he turned not again to them. The <HI>Athenians</HI> impeached <HI>Socrates</HI> upon his life, for going about to innovat and change their Religion. But to set aside natures light, there is not any of the primitive Churches, to which the Apostles wrote Epistles, but they were expressely warned either positively to stand fast in the faith, to hold fast their profession, or negatively to beware of and to avoid false teachers, and not to be carried about with diverse and strange Doctrines. Now it must needs be, not on|ly a truth, but a most speciall and necessary truth, which the Apostles thought fit, thus to presse upon the Churches in all their Epistles writen to them. See <HI>Rom:</HI> 16. 17, 18. 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 16. 13 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11: 3, 4. <HI>Gal:</HI> 1 6, 8. <HI>Eph:</HI> 4. 14. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 2. 18. <HI>Col:</HI> 2. 6. 7, 8. 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2. 2. 3. <HI>Hebr.</HI> 10. 23 and 13. 9. <HI>Iames</HI> 5. 19, 20. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 1, 2, 3. and 3. 16, 17, 18. 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4. 1. <HI>Iude ep: vers:</HI> 3. 4. All these Texts are full and plain, as to this point which I speak to, and in that respect most worthie of our frequent thoughts and observations, especially at such a time when this corner of the world is so full of new and strange Doctrines.</P>
<P>As for the reasons, take these. 1. If we be not stedfast and un|moveable in the profession of our faith, we frustrat (as to us) the end for which the Scriptures were written. <HI>Luke</HI> gives this rea|son
<PB N="136" REF="77">
to his <HI>Theophilus,</HI> why he wrote the story of Christs birth, life and death. <HI>That thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed, Luke.</HI> 1. 4. When <HI>Peter</HI> hath mentioned the voice which came from heaven concerning Christ, hee addeth the certainty of the Scripture as a greater certainty. <HI>We have also a more sure word of prophesie, whereunto ye doe well that yee take he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place,</HI> 2. <HI>Pet:</HI> 1. 19. A voice from heaven might sooner deceive us, then the written word of God. 2. To maintaine and pro|fesse the true Doctrine, and the true faith is by all protestant orthodoxe writers made one, (yea the principall) marke of a true visible Church. Christ himself&punc; <HI>Ioh.</HI> 10. 4, 5. gives us this mark of his sheep, <HI>the sheep follow him</HI> (their shepherd) <HI>for they know his voice, and a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ranger will they not follow, for they know not the voice of strangers.</HI> 3. If once we forsake the way of truth, and goe into an erroneous way, wee shall not know where to finde our paths, we shall wander from mountain to hill, &amp; forget our resting place As one wave comes after ano|ther, so doth one error come after another. As a canker sprea|deth, so doth error, 2. <HI>Tim</HI> 2. 17, <HI>Evill men and seducers, shall waxe worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived</HI> 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 3. 13. Which hath made some, and I hope will make more, who were too inclinable to the new Doctrine and practises of Sectaries at first, now to fall off from them, when <HI>they increase unto more ungodlinesse,</HI> &amp; unto more errour, and there is no end, one error breedeth a hundreth, and a hundreth will breed ten thousand. What was it that made so many fall off from the Prelats, who once joyned with them? Was it not, because they were grow|ing from the old ceremonies to many new ones, and each year almost, brought in some new superstition, and from Popish rites, they grew to Popish doctrines? 4. If w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e waver, and be led about with diverse and strange doctrine;, then the pro|phesies which have gone before of the true Church, shall not
<PB N="137" REF="77">
be made good in us. It was promised concerning the Church and kingdome of Christ, <HI>Isa.</HI> 32. 4, 5. The heart also of the rash, shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stam|merers shall be ready to speak plainly, the vile person shall be no more called liberall, &amp;c. that is those who simply and rash|ly were led about with every winde of Doctrine, shall be so wise and knowing, as to distinguish between truth and error, between vertue and vice, and call each thing by its right name. So, <HI>Isa.</HI> 33. 6. And wisedome and knowledge shall be the stabi|lity of thy times, and strength of salvation. 5. Instability and forsaking the way of Truth, maks us losse much that we had gained, 2 <HI>ep.</HI> of <HI>Iohn, vers.</HI> 8. all the comfort we enjoyed, all the good that ever our souls received of such a Truth, such a cause, such a ministery, all that ever we did or spake or suffe|red for the Truth, all this we losse when we turn aside after an erroneous way. 6. It greatly hindereth our spirituall com|fort and contentment, <HI>Col:</HI> 2, 2. To be knit together in love is one mean, and to have all riches of the full assurance of un|derstanding to the acknowledgement of Gospel truths, is ano|ther mean, by which the Apostle wisheth the hearts of Chri|stians to be comforted. It addeth much to <HI>Pauls</HI> comfort that he could say, <HI>I have kept the Faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown, &amp;c.</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 7. 8. 7. We run a great hazard of our soules and our sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">vation, when we turn aside from truth to error. It is said of the unstable, that they wrest the Scriptures <HI>unto their own destruction,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet:</HI> 3. 16, Like a man fallen into quick sands, the more he wrestles out, the more he sinks. When the Apostle hath spoken of Christs purchasing of our recon|ciliation, justification and sanctification, he addeth an If, <HI>Col:</HI> 1. 23: If ye continue in the faith grounded &amp; setled and be not mo|ved away from the hope of the Gospel which ye have heard. Not that our persevering in the true faith was acondition in Christs purchasing of these blessings, but it is a condition with|out
<PB N="138" REF="78">
which we cannot possesse &amp; enjoy what Christ hath pur|chased; that is, he that falls away from the true Doctrine of the Gospel, proves himself to have no part of the benefits of Christ.</P>
<P>Some errors are in their own nature damnable and incon|sistent with the state of grace, or a fellowship with God, 2 <HI>Pet:</HI> 2. 1. So 2 <HI>ep&punc; Iohn v.</HI> 9. Whosoever transgresseth and abid|eth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. Sure it may be said, of <HI>Arrians, Socinians, Papists, Libertines,</HI> they have not God, because they abide not in the doctrine of Christ, so <HI>Gal:</HI> 5. 4. Other error, there are, of which I may say, whatsoever they are comparatively, impenitency and continuing in them, doth condemne: whence it is that the Apostle <HI>Iames</HI> reckoneth him who erres from the truth, to be in a way of death and dan|ger of damnation, <HI>Ia&punc;</HI> 5. 19. 20.</P>
<P>Now the preservatives against Wavering, and helps to stedfastnesse in the Faith, are these: 1. Grow in knowledge and circumspection; be not simple as Children in understanding. There is <HI>a slight of men and cunning craftinesse whereby they lye in wait to deceive:</HI> So speaks the Apostle of these that spread di|verse and strange Doctrines, <HI>Eph:</HI> 4. 14. and <HI>Rom&punc;</HI> 16. 18. he warres us that they do <HI>by good words and fair speaches deceive the hearts of the simple.</HI> Thou hast therefore need of the wisedom of the serpent that thou be not deceived, as well as of the fim|plicity of the Dove, that thou be not a deceiver, <HI>Phil:</HI> 1. 9: 10.

With the welladvised is wisedome: <HI>Pythagoras</HI> would have us Schollers only to hear, and not to speak for five years.

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Whether a sound heart and an unsound head can consist together, &amp; <HI>vice versa?</HI> or whether truth and holynesse be not inseparable companions.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_TIs one of the greatest objections against the suppres|sing and punishing of Heresies, errors and Schismes. O say they, this is a persecuting of those that are godly, this is a wound to Piety, and the power of godlynesse. I do not denie but there may be, and is true piety in many who are somewhat infected with the leaven of false Doctrine, &amp; live in some erroneous opinion, I dare not appro|priat the name of the godly party to those who are free from any of the errors of the times: those that are truely godly may in diverse things differ in opinion, every error is not inconsi|stant with holynesse, yet every error doth <HI>pro tanto,</HI> and pro|portionably, retard, hinder, and prejudge holynes, and al|though the Devill sow his tares among Christs wheat (I mean in the same persons als well as in the same Church) yet who will say that a field of wheat is nothing the worse of the tares, for then to what end did the enemy watch an opportu|nity of that malicious hostile act, to sow the tares among the wheat? 2. Dangerous and damnable errors can no otherwise consist with true grace, then dangerous and damnable sins, and this I will hold as a good rule in practicall Divinity, that as the want of true piety maks a person (if tempted) apt to be in|fected with error, so error of judgement, if continued in, doth not only hinder growing, but maks a dangerous decreasing

<P>First of all (to make good what I assert) let it be wel observed that the Scripture finds out the roots of Heresies and errors in the corrupt hearts of men, in some raigning unmortified lust, an unstable Heart maks an unstable Head, and a corrupt affecti|on maks a corrupt Judgement. This may appeare in the gene|rall from <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 20. where Heresies are reckoned among the works of the flesh, <HI>Col:</HI> 2, 18. where a superstitious minde is called a fleshly minde; 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 1. 19. where faith is compared to a precious Treasure caried in a ship; a good conscience to the ship that caries it, the losse of the ship is the losse of the load|ning. 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 3. 6. 2 <HI>Thes:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> 10. 11, 12. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6. 12. 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 4. 3. 1 <HI>Joh,</HI> 2. 19. It is therefore a good argument that protestant writers have used against the Popes infallibility. The Pope hath been and may be impious, prophane, sensuall, carnall, proud, covetous. Therefore he may dangerously erre in his inditement&punc; and decrees. Some have derived the originall of all the Popish errors from ambition and avarice, or (as others) from the Cardinalls caps, and the Monks bellies.</P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>Iohn</HI> reduceth all the cares, courses, studies, endeavours, opinions or practises, of the Children of this world, to one of these three, 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2, 16. the lust of the flesh, peculiarly so called, uncleannesse, wantonnesse, gluttony, drunkennesse. <HI>The lust of the eyes,</HI> when the soule is catched with something from without in the world which tempteth, such a thing is goodly to the eye, it entreth in upon the soul by the senses, riches, houses, lands, brave apparell, ornaments, &amp;c. <HI>The pride of life,</HI> so called, because where Pride raignes, a man will als soon quite his life, as that thing which his proud

<P>You shall find many who have embraced new and errone|ous wayes, have been led away with the lust of the flesh, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16, 18&punc; <HI>Philip,</HI> 3: 19. 2 <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t</HI> 2, 13, 14, 18. <HI>Numb&punc;</HI> 25. 1, 2, 3, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 11. 1. 4, 5.

<P>Secondly, there is a reciprocall influence, as of the will and affections, upon the understanding, so of the understanding upon the will and affections, the will determines the under|standing, <HI>quo ad exercitium,</HI> but the understanding determines the will, <HI>quo ad specificationem actus,</HI> that is; the will applyes the understanding unto, or hindereth it from the discerning of good, and evill; yet the will it selfe hath not light in it selfe, but is guided by the light of the understanding; wherefore, as the raine makes vapoures, and the vapoures make raine, so a bad understanding, makes a bad will, and a bad will: makes a bad understanding, if the eye be single, the body is full of light, <HI>Matth.</HI> 6. 22. which makes good what the School|men tells us, that <HI>bonitas voluntatis dependet &agrave; rect&acirc; ratione velut regula,</HI> the goodnesse of the will depends on right reason as 'its rule. See <HI>Aquinas, qu: 2ae quest,</HI> 19. <HI>Art:</HI> 3. and the <HI>Commen|tators</HI> upon that place. 'Tis to be observed, that sometimes the Scripture speaketh of an error of the judgment concerning the faith, as a fountaine and cause of ungodlinesse, prophan|nesse, Atheisme, 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 2. 16, 17, 18, 19. <HI>Gal:</HI> 5. 4. 2 <HI>Epist:</HI> of <HI>Iohn</HI> 9. as contrarie wise, there is a Light and knowledge, which preserveth from sin and ungodlinesse, and leadeth the soul in wayes of holynesse and obedience, <HI>Psal:</HI> 9. 10. and 119. 33. 34 <HI>Iohn</HI> 17. 17. If the knowledge of God, of his Christ, and of his Word, and Will, and Name, and statutes preserve us from sinne, and lead us in the wayes of obedience, then by the rule of contraries, error of judgement in these things, will insnare us in sinne and wickednesse, for instance, an error con|cerning God; whether father, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 15. 21. sonne 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 2. 8. 1 <HI>Ioh&punc;</HI> 2. 23. 2 <HI>Epis: vers:</HI> 9. or holy Ghost, <HI>Ioh:</HI> 14. 17.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="82">Thirdly, as the infection of sinne spreadeth it self, through|out the whole soule, and all the faculties and powers thereof, so doth the worke of the Spirit of God. Wee finde light and holinesse, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 9. joyned together like the <HI>Vrim</HI> and <HI>Thum|mim.</HI> See also 1 <HI>Thes:</HI> 5. 23. here is both Soul and Spirit san|ctified, which two are plainly distinguished, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 12. The word of God is so quick and powerfull&punc; as that it pierceth e|ven to the dividing asunder of the Soul and Spirit, if either the intellectuals be not sound, or if the vitals and animals bee not right, the word will finde it out. A well meaning pious soul; a good heart and affection, which perhaps, a person may sit down satisfied with, will not excuse a corrupt minde, an erroneous spirit; neither will a sound and orthodox judge|ment excuse a corrupt heart, and inordinat affections: <HI>Aristo|tle</HI> himself could distinguish Art and knowledge from vertue, because the most excellent intellectuals, cannot make a man so much as morally vertuous, without the practise and exercise of vertue. Both soul and spirit, both the inferior and superior part of the soule&punc; must be sanctified. Reason is as the helme, the affections as the sailes, let the helme bee stirred never so right, if the winde either blow not at all, or blow crosse in the sailes, the ship makes no speed in her way, let the winde blow never so faire, and fill all the sailes, yet if the helme be off 'its hingers, or be not rightly stirred, the ship may quickly run upon a rock, or run a shore where 'tis not saife: so he that hath a sound judgement without good affections, cannot move heaven ward. He that hath good affections, without a sound judgement, will make more haste than good speed: Reason is as the rider: affections as a nimble horse, a man is but in an ill taking, if either this rider mistake his way, or the horse run away with him out of the way, having no raines to governe him, or if the horse be lame and cannot ride.</P>
<P>Fourthly, consider what the Apostle saith, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16.
<PB N="147" REF="82">
17. He tels us of foure ends and uses of Scripture, the first two are commonly referred to doctrinals, the last two to practicalls, the Scripture is profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction, <HI>in righteousnesse, that the man of God may bee perfect, throughly furnished unto ali good works.</HI> If any of these be wanting, a Christian is not perfect, so much as in the perfection of parts. He is but halfe a Christian, who is an orthodox beleever, if he be not practicall also: and he is but halfe a Christian who is practicall, if he bee not an ortho|dox beleever. These ends of Scripture do not consist, nor stand sure one without another.</P>
<P>Fifthly, to bee led into all truth, and preserved from error, is a work of the spirit of truth, and this spirit of the truth is the Comforter, and the spirit of sanctification, which spirit the Mediator prayeth the Father to give unto those that are his, <HI>Ioh:</HI> 14. 16, 17. and 16. 13, 14. 1 <HI>Ioh:</HI> 2. 27. no promise of being led into all truth, but to those that receave the anoyn|ting of the holy Ghost. <HI>Isa.</HI> 54. 13 <HI>Psal:</HI> 25. 12.</P>
<P>Sixthly, by how much a man falls from the truth, by so much he falls from grace, and by how much a man falls from grace, by so much he falls from the truth, for stability in the stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of grace, dependeth in a manner upon stability in the truth, for proof whereof mark three <HI>Ifs,</HI> Christs, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 8. 31.

These Scripturall <HI>Ifs</HI> have much in them, and should make us very cautious and headfull, that we do not so farre deceave our selves, as to divide what God hath joyned together, a sound head and a sound heart, <HI>Chry|sostome</HI> exhorteth his hearers, to joyn Christian vertues, and purity of doctrines together, for saith he, <HI>it profiteth us nothing to be orthodox, if the life be vitiated: as upon the other part, a un|corrupt</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De verbis Apost.

<HI>of judgement in Doctrines, will certainly introduce licenti|ousnesse of heart and life,</HI> in practicalls. <HI>Arminius</HI> himself (al|though many of his followers have cryed up, <HI>Septicisme</HI> in<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rat. de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ompon. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">elig: dissi|lio.</NOTE> Religion,) could say that different doctrines produce in a people, a dubitation, or hesitation concerning Religion&punc; that this doubting of the truth produceth&punc; despairing to finde the truth, and thence followes <HI>Atheisme</HI> and <HI>Epicurisme,</HI> yet when Heresies and false Doctrines introduce <HI>Atheisme</HI> &amp; <HI>Epicurisme,</HI> they do but discover those roots of bitternes which were before in the heart. Therefore as Christ tells those Jews that beleeved on him, if they continue not in his word, they are not his dis|ciples indeed, <HI>Ioh:</HI> 8. 31. so the Apostle <HI>Ioh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> gives this rea|son, why <HI>Simon Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s, Hymeneus, Alexander, Philetus, Me|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ander, Carpocrates, Basilides, Ebion, Cerinthus,</HI> and such like, went out and separated from the Church, and from the profes|sion of the truth, because saith he, they were not of us&punc; mean|ing, in respect of lively faith; true grace and regeneration, therefore they went out from us, 1 <HI>Ioh:</HI> 2. 19. which Text in <HI>Iohn, Hierome</HI> in the close of his first book upon <HI>Ieremiah,</HI> applyes to Hereticks in this respect, when they fall away openly, they doe but shew those very idols of their hearts, which in their in ward parts they worshipped before.</P>
<P>I will adde a seventh reason, look how the Scripture distin|guisheth the Elect from those who are of an ungodly life, in the same manner it distinguisheth them who are of an erroneous beleif, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. 19: the Apostle. 2 <HI>Thes:</HI> 2. 10, 11. tells us that these who perish, beleeve a lie: <HI>i. e.</HI> an error pretending to be a truth, but <HI>vers:</HI> 13. he gives thanks for the beleeving Thessalonians, <HI>because God had chosen them to sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">vation, through sanctification of the spirit, and beleif of the truth:</HI> so that they who beleeve not the truth, are no more elected, then the un|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nctified. Our Saviour, <HI>Mat:</HI> 24. 24. intimateth, that it is impossible that the Elect should be deceaved by false prophets,
<PB N="149" REF="83">
that is, in the same sense, as he that is borne of God, doth not commit sin, 1 <HI>Ioh:</HI> 3. 9. Christ characterizeth his true disciples, and distinguisheth them from others, not onely by obedience and a good life, <HI>Mat:</HI> 7. 17. 24. and 25. 35. <HI>Ioh:</HI> 13. 35. but also by light in the eye of the understanding, <HI>Matth&punc;</HI> 6. 22. 23. with <HI>Ephes</HI> 1. 17. 18. by continuing in his word, <HI>Ioh:</HI> 8. 31. by knowing his voice, and fleeing from a stranger, <HI>Ioh:</HI> 10. 4. 5. I hope I have aboundantly proved what I undertook, and so I conclude that he said right, who compared truth to the teacher, holinesse and righteousnesse to the ruling Elders: I adde where Heresie is the teacher, ungodlynesse and unrighteousnesse, are the ruling Elders, a holy Hereticke is a <HI>Chimera,</HI> and a pro|phane person, beleeving a right is another.</P>
<P>But here peradventure some will think, that the great ob|jection lyes, may not a prophane person have a sound or or|thodox judgement in all controverted truthes&punc; May not a man understand all mysteries and all knowledge, who yet hath no love, nor true sanctification? 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 13. 2. May not a per|son hold fast the profession of the true faith without wavering, whose heart not withstanding, is not right with God nor sted|fast in his Covenant?</P>
<P>I answer first, where there is but a forme of godlynesse, there is but aforme of knowledge, <GAP DESC="foreign"> is a word no where used by the holy Ghost, but in two places, a forme of knowledge, <HI>Rom:</HI> 2. 20. and a forme of godlinesse, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 5.

<PB N="150" REF="84">
<HI>Theophilact</HI> saith, some understand it to be the image, and false resemblance of knowledge, so <HI>Hesychius</HI> and <HI>Suydas</HI> understand <GAP DESC="foreign">, to be <GAP DESC="foreign"> an image of a thing.</P>

<P>First, it cuts off the exception of those who cry out against the censuring, suppressing and punishing of Hereticks by the Christian Magistrate, as if this were a persecuting of pietie or pious persons, when it is indeed a suppressing of a work of the flesh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">for Heresie is no other, <HI>Gal:</HI> 5. 20.) and of that which is ei|ther the cause or effect, either the usher or page of someimpiety.</P>

<P>4. It is but an ignorant mistake, and a dangerous soul deceav|ing presumption, for a prophane loose-liver, or for a close im|mortified and rotten hearted hypocrite, to thinke or promise, that he will stand fast in the faith, and hold fast the truth with|out wavering. Whosoever maketh ship wracke of a good consci|ence, cannot but make shipwracke of faith too. Hee that is

overcome of a sinne, may be overcome of an error too, when he is tempted in that which is the idol of his heart. Therefore let him who would have light from Christ, awake from his sinnes, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 14. Hee that hath not pious affections, and thinkes his orthodoxe judgement will make him stedfast in the faith, is as great a fool, as he that thinkes to ride without a horse, or a Captain that thinks to fight the enemy without soul|diers, or a Mariner that thinks to make out his voyage when his ship wants sailes.</P>
<P>5. They that would have Church censures, put forth only upon Hereticks, Apostats, or such as are unsound in the faith, but not upon prophane livers in the Church (which was the error of <HI>Erastus,</HI> and before him, of the Princes and States of <HI>Germany,</HI> in the 100. Grievances, the Originall of which error, so farre as I can finde, was from the darknesse of Popery, for there was an opinion that the Pope might be de|posed for Heresie, but not for a scandalous life which opi|nion <HI>Aeneus Sylvius, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">gest is concilii Basil,</HI> lib: 1. confuteth, they also upon the other hand, that would have the censure of excommunication put forth upon loose and scandalous livers within the Church, but not for those things, which the refor|med Churches call Heresies.

<P>6. There is cause to set a part dayes of fasting and prayers, when Heresies and errors abound, as well as when prophan|nesse, and grosse wickednesse aboundeth in the lives of people, Christ doth in five of his Epistles to the Churches of <HI>Asia</HI> (to <HI>Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatyra, Philadelphia</HI>) take notice of false Teachers, Sects, and erroneous Doctrines, commen|ding the zeal in <HI>Ephesus</HI> against them, blaming those in <HI>Perga|mos</HI> and <HI>Thyatira,</HI> for tollerating such amongst them, incoura|ging
<PB N="156" REF="87">
those in <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> by expressing his dis|pleasure against those Sects. No mention of loose and scan|dalous livers, distinguished from the Sects in those Churches. Either there were such scandalous livers in those Churches at that time, or not. If there were, then observe, Christ mentions not them, but the false Teachers and Sectaries, for although both are condemnable, yet he takes speciall notice of scandals in Doctrine, and profession, as being matters of the highest treason against him, and the most provoking sinnes in a Church, as being also the more deceitfull, and secreet poyson honey|ed over with plausible pretences, and therefore the more need|ing a discovery? If there were no such scandalous and pro|phane livers in these Churches. Then note, that Christ will have a great controversie against a Church, which hath false Doctrin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s, and pernitious Sects in it, although there were ne|ver a scandalous person more in it. There is therefore cause to fast and pray, for which Christ makes a matter of contro|versie against his Churches: If we have prayed away Popery, Prelacy; the old superstitious ceremonies, the Malignant Armies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> O let us cry mightily for this also, see if wee can pray away Heresies, and pernitious Doctrines, Sects and Schismes.</P>
<P>7. We must turne away from, and avoid the fellowship of false Teachers, and the spreaders of dangerous Doctrines, not only that we may bee stedfast in the truth, but that our hearts may be established with grace, for there are such rea|sons given in Scripture, for avoiding the company of that kinde of men, as highly concerne piety, <HI>avoid them, because they serve not Christ, but their owne bellies, Rom.</HI> 16. 17, 18. from such turne away, because they are men of corrupt minds, supposing gaine to be godlinesse, and their disputings breed envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 6. 4, 5. re|ceave them not into your houses, who bring not the Do|ctrine

As we de|sire to hold out in a time of tryall, let us hold fast truth and holinesse together, and cast away from us whatsoever maketh us to offend, whether it be the right eye of an erroneous opi|nion, or the right hand of a sinfull will, or the right foot of a carnall affection.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Whether conscionable Christians and such as love the power aud pra|ctice of piety, can without defiling their conscience, or without a destructive wounding of the power of godlinesse, embrace and hold the principles of these who call themselves the godly party? Or whether they ought not rather to avoid those who doe now Pha|risaically and Donatistically appropriat to them selves the name of the godly party, as being indeed, such who under pretence of Zeal, for the power of godlinesse, hold diverse ungodly principles.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_LEt no man here stumble in the threshold, or bee scan|dalized at the case I put: I intend nothing, either against piety, or truely pious persons, but to vindicat both from those principles of impiety, which some maintaine and adhere unto, under colour of piety. The <HI>Ar|rians, Ebionites,</HI> and <HI>Socinians</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> have pretended to bee the godly party there, in so much that <HI>Faustus Socinus</HI> wrote a book entituled thus, <HI>That the men of the kingdome of</HI> Poland, <HI>and the great Dutchy of</HI> Lithuania, <HI>commonly called Evangelicks, who were studious of solid piety, ought altogether to adjoyne them|selves to the Assembly of those, who in the same places are falsely and undescrvedly called</HI> Arrians <HI>and</HI> Ebionites.</P>
<P>There is as little truth in that pretence, which diverse Secta|ries now make to the way of godlinesse, observe but these prin|ciples of theirs.</P>
<P>1. That none ought to be punished for Preaching, Printing, or maintaining any error in Faith or Religion, except it be con|trary to the very light of nature.</P>
<P>Hence it will follow, that none is to be punished for Preach|ing or publishing these errors: That the Scripture is not the word of God. That Jesus Christ was an impostor or deceaver,
<PB N="160" REF="89">
for the light of nature will never serve to confute these or such like errors concerning the Scriptures, the truths concerning them, being wholly supernaturall. M^r. <HI>I: Goodwin</HI> in his <HI>Ha|giomastix sect:</HI> 58. holds, that he who will hold that there is no Christ, is not so pernicious nor punishable, as that man who lives, as if there were no Christ, and one of his reasons is this, because, saith he, <HI>the sinnes mentioned, adultery, theft,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>are clearly, and at first sight against the light and law of nature, but the denyall of the being of such a person as Christ, who is both God and man, is not contrary to any law or principle in nature.</HI> I desire that the reader may here observe the words of M^r. <HI>Burroughes,</HI> in the Epistle dedicatorie of his Sermon preached before the house of Peers, <HI>Novemb:</HI> 26. 1645. <HI>For connivence at blas|phemies, or damnable Heresies; God forbid, any should open his mouth, these who are guilty herein against the light of nature, should be taken off from the face of the earth; and such as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e guilty against supernaturall light, are to be refrained and kept from the society of men, that they infect not others.</HI> The latter part of that which he saith, I accept, and I would to God, that so much were put in execution. But why no other Hereticks, or blasphe|mers should be taken off from the face of the earth, but those onely who are guilty against the light of nature: I finde no reason brought for it, and I doe not understand how it comes to passe, that any who look so much forward to new lights, should herein fall so farre backwark as to the light of nature; or that those who decline the light of nature in matter of Church government, subordination, appeals, and the like, should nothwithstanding in matters of faith, which are much more sublime, appeal to the light of nature: There is need of some Oedipus here.</P>
<P>2. That in controversies or questions of Religion, we must not argue from the old Testament, but from the new. Hence are these exclamations against old Testament Spirits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="89">
which might indeed beseem the <HI>Manichees,</HI> who denyed and acknowledged not the old Testament. But to bee heard in a reformed Church, among those who acknowledge the old Testament to be the word of God, as well as the new, 'tis most strange.</P>
<P>Our orthodox protestant writers, condemne as well the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> who reject and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">orne at arguments brought against them from the old Testament, as the <HI>Manichees</HI> who did repudiat the old Testament, as having proceeded from an evill God. See <HI>P&punc; Martyr</HI> in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 12. <HI>Aret: proble: theol: loc.</HI> 56.</P>
<P>By this principle they shall not hold it contrary to the will of God under the new Testament, that a man marry his fa|thers brothers wife, this not being forbidden in the new Testament, but in the old. Some indeed of this time have maintained, that it is not unlawfull to us to marry within these degrees which are forbidden, <HI>Lev:</HI> 18. See M^r. <HI>Edwards</HI> in the third part of <HI>Gangraena, pag</HI> 3. These hold, 'tis onely forbid|den to commit fornication with such as are within these de|grees, not being married, as if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> were not unlawfull to com|mit fornication with any, be they never so farre without these degrees. By the same principle which rejecteth old Testa|ment proofs, they must deny the duty of children under the new Testament, to marry with their parents consent, and this is one of the foule errors of some Sectaries now adayes, that <HI>though consent of parents unto childrens marriage, was commanded under the law to them that lived then, yet because that was but a ceremonie, 'tis now lawfull to marry without their consent, because we live under the Gospell.</HI> See that same third part of <HI>Gangrae|na, pag:</HI> 14. By the same principle they must deny that an oath (be it never so just and necessary) may be imposed by autho|rity&punc; Or that the Magistrat ought to put to death, a blasphe|mer, an incestuous person, an adulterer, a Witch, or the
<PB N="162" REF="90">
like, (the Scripturall warrants which make these crimes ca|pitall, being in the old, not in the new Testament.) Saith not the Apostle, 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 3. 16. <HI>all Scripture</HI> (and consequent|ly the lawfull examples, and la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">dable presidents of the old Testament,) <HI>is given by in spiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteous|nesse,</HI> Rom. 15. 4. <HI>Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning.</HI> Is not our justification by faith proved, by the example of <HI>Abrahams</HI> justification by faith? <HI>Rom:</HI> 4. Doth not Christ himself defend his Disciples there, plucking the ears of corne upon the Sabbath day, by the exam|ple of <HI>Davids</HI> eating the shew bread, and by the example of the Priests killing of sacrifices upon the Sabbath day, <HI>Matth:</HI> 12. Yea, those that most cry out against proofs from examples of the old Testament, are as ready as others to borrow proofs from thence, when they think to serve their turne thereby, which <HI>Aretius, probl: theol: loc.</HI> 56. instanceth in the <HI>Anabap|tists,</HI> who would not admit proofs from examples of the old Testament, yet many of them justified the <HI>Bowrs</HI> bloudy warre, by the example of the <HI>Israelits</HI> rising against <HI>Pharaoh.</HI></P>
<P>3. That if Sectaries and Heretickes make a breach of peace, disturbe the State, or doe evill against the Common-wealth in civil things, then the Magistrate may punish and suppresse them. But Sectaries and Heretickes, who are otherwise peace|able in the State, and subject to the Lawes, and lawfull power of the civil Magistrate, ought to be tollerated and forborne. This is their <HI>Kodesh hakkodashim,</HI> their <HI>holy of holies:</HI> indeed their <GAP DESC="foreign">.

<P>6. There are divers <HI>Arminian</HI> and <HI>Antinomian</HI> Tenents, which very much strengthen the hands of the wicked in his wickednesse, yet such Tenents are maintained by many of these, who call themselves the godly party, for instance that of universall atonement, and Christ dying for all men, mark but the title of M^r. <HI>Moores</HI> book: <HI>The universality of Gods free grace in Christ, to mankinde proclaimed and displayed,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that all might be comforted, incouraged, every one consirmed, and assu|red of the propitiation and death of Christ for the whole race of man|kinde, and so for himself in particular.</HI></P>
<P>Hereby the same sweetnesse of Gospell comforts, and the same assurance of an interest in Jesus Christ and his death, is imparted and extended to the humbled, and the unhumbled, to the convinced, and to the unconvinced, to the wounded, and to the unwounded, to beleevers, and to the unbeleevers, to the converted, and to the unconverted; as if all and every one were fit to be comforted and capable of an assurance, that Je|sus Christ hath redeemed them, and made satisfaction to the Divine justice in their behalfe.

<P>7. Other Tenents are current among many of that party, which are apt to weaken the hearts and hands of the godly in the exercises of humiliation, repentance, mortification, and fruits of sanctification, by holding that God doth not chastise his children for sinne; that there is not so much as a fatherly displeasure, or anger in God against the faults of his children&punc; that God seeth no sinne in <HI>Israel,</HI> so much as to afflict them for it in this world; that beleevers are not bound to live accor|ding to the rule of the morall law; that beleevers are not to be terrified, or at all wrought upon by any threatnings, or by danger and punishment of sinne; that beleevers ought not to trie their spirituall estate, or seek assurance of their interest in Jesus Christ, and the Covenant of grace, by any gratious signes or qualifications, or by any fruits of sanctification in themselves, but onely by the inward testimony of the Spirit and light of faith, which (say they) are of sufficient credit by themselves, without the help of any markes of grace. It is informed, that among some of the Sectaries of this time, are found these Tenents, that adultery is no sinne, and that drunkennesse is none neither, but a help to see Christ the bet|ter; that there is no resurrection of the dead, nor no hell.

part, I hold it unlawfull with divers good Writers; And I con|ceive that <HI>Exod.</HI> 34. God forbiddeth not only Religious Co|venants with the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> but even civill Covenants, <HI>vers.</HI> 12. and conjugall Covenants, <HI>vers.</HI> 16. Which is also <HI>Iunius</HI> his opinion in his Analysis upon that place. The reason for the unlawfulnesse of such confederacies are brought. 1. From the Law, <HI>Exod,</HI> 23. 32. and 34. 12. 15. <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 2. Yea God mak|eth this a principall stipulation and condition upon their part, while he is making a Covenant with them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34. 10. 12. <HI>Iud.</HI> 2. 1. 2. and lest it should be thought that this is meant only of these seven Nations enumerate, <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. the same Law is interpret of four other Nations, 1. <HI>Kings</HI> 11. 1, 2. so that tis to be understood generally against confederacies with Ido|laters and those of a false Religion: And the reason of the Law is Morall and perpetuall, <HI>viz.</HI> the danger of ensnaring the people of God: therefore they were forbidden to Covenant either with their gods, or with themselves, for a conjunction of Counsels, and familiar conversation (which are consequents of a Covenant) draweth in end to a fellowship in Religion. 2. From disallowed and condemned examples, as <HI>Asa</HI> his Cove|nant with <HI>Benhadad,</HI> 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> 16. to <HI>vers.</HI> 10. And <HI>Ahaz,</HI> his Covenant with the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 16. 7. 10. 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 28. 16. to 23. And if it should be objected, these are but ex|amples of Covenants with Idolatrous heathens, there is not the like reason to condemne confederacies, and associations with wicked men of the same Religion; I answer. 1.

So <HI>Amaziah</HI> ha|ving associate himself in an expedition with the <HI>Israelites,</HI> when God was not with them, did upon the Prophets admo|nition disjoin himself from them, and take his hazard of their anger: 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 25. 7, 8, 9, 10. <HI>Lavater</HI> upon the place applying that example, noteth this as one of the causes why the Christian Wars with the <HI>Turke</HI> had so ill successe, why saith he, consi|der what Souldiers were imployed, this is the fruit of associa|tions with the wicked. 3. These confederacies proceed from an evill heart of unbelief, as is manifest by the reasons which are brought against <HI>Ahaz</HI> his League with <HI>Benhadad,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16. 7, 8, 9. and by that which is said against the confederacy with the King of <HI>Assyria, Isay</HI> 8. 12, 13. for as <HI>Calvin</HI> upon the place noteth, the unbeleevers among the people consider|ing their own inability for managing so great a War, thoght it necessary to have a confederacy with the <HI>Assyrians;</HI> but this was from faithlesse feares, from want of faith to stay and rest upon God as all-sufficient 4.

<P>Now as to the Arguments which use to be brought for the contrary opinion, First 'tis objected that <HI>Abraham</HI> had a con|federacy with <HI>Aner, Eschol,</HI> and <HI>Mamre, Genesis</HI> 14. 13. <HI>Ab|raham</HI> with <HI>Abimelech, Genesis</HI> 21. 27. 32 and <HI>Isaac</HI> with <HI>Abi|melech,</HI>

Answ. 1 It cannot be proved that these confederates of <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> were either ido|laters or wicked; <HI>Laban</HI> indeed was an idolater: But there are good interpreters who conceive that <HI>Abrahams</HI> three confe|derates feared God; and that <HI>Abimelech</HI> also feared God, because he speaketh reverently of God, and ascri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eth to God the blessing and prosperity of those Patriarchs.</P>
<P>'Tis presumed also that <HI>Hiram</HI> was a pious man, because of his Epistle to <HI>Solomon,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 2. 11, 12. however, 2. Those confederacies were civill, either for commerce, or for peace and mutuall security that they should not wrong one another, as that with <HI>Laban, Gen.</HI> 31. 52. and with <HI>Abimelech. Gen.</HI> 26. 29. which kinde of confederacy is not controverted.</P>

Answ. 1. That Covenant is disallowed by many good Writers; yet 'tis observed from the Story that they had not the better, but the worse successe, nor the lesse but the more trouble following it. 2. The Story it selfe, 1 <HI>Macc.</HI> 1. 12. tells us that the first motion of a confederacy with the heathen in those times pro|ceeded from the children of Belial in <HI>Israel.</HI> Lastly, it may be objected that persons discontented, and of broken fortunes were gathered to <HI>David;</HI> and that he received them, and be|came a Captaine unto them, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22. 2. Answ. 1. Some think (and 'tis probable) they were such as were oppressed and wronged by <HI>Sauls</HI> tyranny, and were therefore in debt and discontented, and that <HI>David</HI> in receiving them was a type of Christ who is a refuge for the afflicted, and touched with the feeling of their infirmities. 2.

That <HI>Davids</HI> helpers in the War were lookt upon as sincere, cordiall, and stirred up of God, may further appear from 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12. where <HI>David</HI> joyneth with himself <HI>fidos homines qui idem cum eo senti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ent,</HI> saith <HI>Lavater</HI> on the place, faithfull men of his own minde: hee addeth, that they were such as hated <HI>Sauls</HI> impiety and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ustice, and loved <HI>Davids</HI> vertue. <HI>Vict.

(which was an Argument of sincerity) also, that some of <HI>Benjamin (Sauls</HI> own tribe) adjoyned themselves to <HI>David,</HI> and the spirit came upon <HI>Amasai,</HI> who by a speciall Divine instinct spake to assure <HI>David</HI> of their sincerity, <HI>vers.</HI> 2. 16, 18.

confederacies with us, whom they call <HI>Calvinists:</HI> So argueth <HI>Tarnovius Tract. de Foederib.</HI> But we may make a very good use of it: for as we ought to pray and endeavour that all who are Christs may be made one in him, so we ought to pray against and by all means avoide fellowship, familiaritie, Marriages, and military confederacies with known wicked persons, and such as are of a false or hereticall Religion: I shall branch forth this matter in five particulars, which God forbade to his people in reference to the <HI>Canaanites</HI> and other heathens, which also (partly by parity of reason, partly by concluding more strongly) will militate against confederacies and conjuncti|ons with such as under the profession of the Christian Religion do either maintain Heresies and dangerous Errors, or live a prophane and wicked life.</P>
<P>First, God forbade all Religious Covenants with such, and would not have his people to tolerate the gods, images, altars or groves of idolaters: <HI>Exod.</HI> 23. 32. and 34. 13. <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 5. <HI>Iudg.</HI> 2: 2. And although the letter of the Law mention this in reference to the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> yet the best reforming Kings of <HI>Iudah</HI> applyed and executed this Law in taking away the groves and high places abused by the <HI>Iewes</HI> in their superstiti|on: And what marvell? If such things were not to be tolle|rated<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrat. hist: lib. 5 Cap. 10.</NOTE> in the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> much lesse in the <HI>Iewes. Theodosius</HI> is comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nded for his suppressing and punishing Hereticks.</P>
<P>2. God forbade familiar conversation with these heathens, that they should not dwell together with his people, nay, not in the land with them, <HI>Exod</HI> 23. 33. lest one of them being fa|miliar with an <HI>Israelite,</HI> might call him to a feast, and make him eat of things sacrificed to idols, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3. 15, Com|pare this with <HI>Iud.</HI> 1. 21. <HI>Psal</HI> 106. 35. Now the Apostle layeth much more restraint upon us, from conversing, eating and drinking with a scandalous Christian, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 11. then with a <HI>Pagan</HI> or unbeleever, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 27. There is a conversing
<PB N="175" REF="96">
and companying with wicked persons, which is our affliction, not our fault, that is when we cannot be rid of them, do what we can, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 10. which is an argument against separating and departing from a true Church, because of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">andalous persons in it. The Apostle gives this check to such, go where they will, they shall finde scandalous persons all the world over. There is again a conversing and companying with wicked persons, which naturall and civill bonds, or near rela|tions, or our calling tyeth us unto, as between husband and wife, Parent and Child, Pastor and People, Magistrate and those of his charge. But wittingly &amp; willingly to converse &amp; have fellowship either with hereticall or prophane persons, whether it be out of love to them and delight in them, or for our owne interest or some worldly benefite this is cer|tainly sinfull and inexcusable. If we take care of our bodily safety, by flying the company of such as have the plague, yea if we take care of the safety of our beasts, and would not to our knowledge suffer a scabbed or rotten sheep to infect the rest, shall we not much more take care of our own and neigh|bours souls, by avoiding and warning others to avoide the fellowship of the ungodly, whereby spiritual infection comes. Remember it was but a kinde visite of <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> to <HI>Ahab</HI> which was the occasion of ingageing him into a confederacy with that wicked man, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 18. 2&punc; 3.</P>
<P>3 God forbade conjugall Covenants or Marrying with them. <HI>Exod:</HI> 34, 16. <HI>Deut:</HI> 7, 3. The rule is the same against matching with other wicked persons, whether Idolaters or professing the same Religion with us. We read not of Idolatry or any professed doctrinall differences in Religion between the Posterity of <HI>Seth</HI> and the posterity of <HI>Cain,</HI> yet this was the great thing that corrupted the old world and brought on the flood, that the children of God joyned themselves in Mar|riage with the prophane, <HI>Gen:</HI> 6, 1, 2, 3. <HI>Iehoram</HI> married not
<PB N="176" REF="97">
an heathen, but the daughter of <HI>Ahab;</HI> but 'tis marked, he did evill as did the house of <HI>Ahab;</HI> And what is the reason given for this? <HI>For the daughter of</HI> Ahab <HI>was his wife,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 8, 18, and by and by, <HI>vers:</HI> 27. the like is marked of <HI>Ahaziah</HI> the son of <HI>Iehoram,</HI> who <HI>did evill in the sight of the Lord as did the house of</HI> Ahab, <HI>for he was the son in law of the house of</HI> Ahab. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> supposeth that Christians marrie such as are <HI>heirs together of the grace of life,</HI> 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3, 7. see also, <HI>Pro:</HI> 31. 30.</P>
<P>4. God forbade his people to make with the Canaanites <HI>foedus deditionis</HI> or <HI>subactionis,</HI> (or as others speak) <HI>pactum libe|ratorium,</HI> he would have his people shew no mercy to those whom hee had destinate to destruction, <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 2. Herein <HI>Ahab</HI> sinned, making a brotherly Covenant of friendship with <HI>Benhadad,</HI> when God had delivered him into his hand, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 20. 32, 33, 34. So in all Christian common-wealths, the Magistrate, Gods vicegerent ought to cut off such evill doers, as Gods Word appointeth to be cut off. <HI>Davids</HI> sparing of <HI>Ioab</HI> and <HI>Shimei,</HI> being partly necessitate thereto, partly indu|ced by politicall reasons, (whereof he repented when he was dying, nor could his conscience beat-ease, till he left a charge upon <HI>Solomon,</HI> for executing justice upon both <HI>Ioab</HI> and <HI>Shimei,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.) are no good presidents or warrands to Christian Magistrates, to neglect the executing of justice. 'Tis a better president which <HI>David</HI> resolveth, upon more de|liberatly, <HI>Psal.</HI> 101. 8. <HI>I will early destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord.</HI> Marke this <HI>all,</HI> of what degree or quality soever, without re|spect of persons, and that <HI>early,</HI> and without delay. Lastly, and even <HI>Ioab</HI> himself was so far punished by <HI>David,</HI> that hee was cast out of his place and command, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 19. 3. &amp; 20. 4.</P>
<P>5. The Law is also to be applyed against civill Covenants, not of peace, or of commerce, but of warre; that is, a League offensive and defensive, wherein we associate our selves
<PB N="177" REF="97">
with idolaters, infidels, hereticks, or any other knowne ene|mies of truth or godlines, so as to have the same friends or ene|mies. A covenant of Peace or commerce with such may hap|pen to be unlawfull in respect of some circumstances as when Peace is given to those Rebells, Murderers, Incendiaries in the Kingdome, who by the law of God ought to be destroyed by the hand of Justice, or when commerce with idolaters is so abused, as to furn sh them with the things that they are known to make use of in their idolatry. But as for <GAP DESC="foreign">, a confede|racy ingageing us into a Warre with such associats, tis abso|lutely and in its own nature unlawfull: And I finde it condem|ned by good Writers, of the Popish party, of the <HI>Luthe|ran</HI> party, and of the Orthodoxe party. Some of all these are before cited. What holynesse God required in the Armies of <HI>Israel,</HI> see <HI>Deut:</HI> 23. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14: we may well argue as <HI>Isi|dorus P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lusiota</HI> doth, <HI>lib.</HI> 3 Epist. 14. If the Law was so severe against such uncleannesses as were not voluntarie, how much lesse would God suffer such as did voluntarily and wickedly defile themselves. Tis marked as a part of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">imelechs</HI> sin, <HI>Iud: 9.</HI> 4. that he <HI>hired vain and light persons which followed him.</HI> God would have <HI>Amaziah</HI> to dismisse an hundred thousand men of <HI>Israel</HI> being already with him in a body, and told him he should fall before the enemy if these went with him, because God was not with them, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 25. 7. &amp;c. If they had not yet been gathered into a body, it had been much to abstain from gathering them, upon the Prophets admonition, but this is much more, that he sends them away after they are in a body, and takes his hazard of all the hurt that so many in|raged Souldiers could do to him or his people, and indeed they did much hurt in going back, <HI>vers:</HI> 13, yet God rewarded <HI>Amaziahs</HI> obedience with a great Victory. In the last age short|ly after the begun Reformation in <HI>Germany,</HI> this case of con|science concerning the unlawfulnesse of such confederacies
<PB N="178" REF="98">

The city of <HI>Strassburg,</HI> Anno, 1629. made<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleid. com. lib. 7. pag. 106.</NOTE> a defensive League with <HI>Zurik, Berne,</HI> and <HI>Basil, Qui &amp; vicini erant, &amp; dogmate magis conveniebant,</HI> saith <HI>Sleidan,</HI> they were not onely neighbours, but of the same Faith and Religion, there|fore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid: lib: 8 pag. 127, de Helveti|is infoedus recipien|dis&punc; quod civitates valde cu|piebant, S&aacute;xo per Legatos respondet, quoniam de coena Dom. diversum sequantur dogma non sibi licere societatem cum ipsis ullam coire: quanti sit ipsorum conjunctio, propter vires atque potentiam, non se quidem latere, sed eo sibi minime respiciendum esse, ne tristis inde sequatur exitus, quod iis accidisse Scriptura testetur, qui muniendi sui causa, cujusque modi praesidiis usi fuissent.

About two yeares after the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> refused to take into confederacy those <HI>Eelvetians,</HI> because although they were powerfull, and might be very helpfull to him, yet they differing in Religion, concerning the Article of the Lords Supper, he said, he durst not joyne with them as confederats, lest such sad things might befal him, as the Scripture testifieth to have befallen those who for their help or defence took any assistance they could get.</P>
<P>The rule was good <HI>in thesi.</HI> although in that particular case misapplyed. The very heathens had a notion of the unlawful|nesse of confederacies with wicked men, for as <HI>Victorinus Stri|gelius</HI> on 2 <HI>Chron:</HI> 25. noteth out of <HI>Aeschylus</HI> his tragedy, intitu|led, <HI>Seven to Thebe, Amphiaraus</HI> a wise vertuous man was there|fore swallowed up in the earth with seven men, and seven horses, because he had associat himself with <HI>Tydeus; Capaneus,</HI> and other impious Commanders marching to the siege of <HI>The|be.</HI> Lastly, take this reason for further confirmation, as wee must doe all to the glory of God, so wee must not make Warres to our selves, but to the Lord; hence <HI>the booke of the Warres of the Lord,</HI> Num: 21, 14, and, <HI>the battel is not ours, but the Lords.</HI> 1 Sam: 25, 28, 2 <HI>Chron:</HI> 20, 15.

<P>As for the Objections from Scripture, they are before answered. There are many other exceptions of mens cor|rupt reason, which yet may be easily taken off, if wee will receive Scripture light. That very case of <HI>Iehosophats</HI> confe|deracy with <HI>Ahab,</HI> taketh off many of them; for although, 1. <HI>Iehosophat</HI> was a good man, and continued so after that as|sociation, not drawn away into Idolatry, nor infected with <HI>Ahabs</HI> Religion, but onely assisting him in a civil businesse&punc; 2. <HI>Ahab</HI> lived in the Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> which was still a Church, although greatly corrupted, and hee was no professed hater of God, (only he had professed to hate <HI>Micajah</HI> the man of God,) yea, lately besore this he appeared very penitent, and some think <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> now judged charitably of <HI>Ahab,</HI> because of that great humilation and repentance of his, which God did accept, so far, as to reward it with a temporall sparing mercy, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 21. at the end: then followes immediatly, <HI>Chap:</HI> 22. <HI>Iehosaphats</HI> association with him. Although <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> was al|so joyned in affinity with <HI>Ahab, Ahabs</HI> daughter being married to his sonne. 3. The enemy was the King of <HI>Syria;</HI> and <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> doth not joyne with a wicked Man against any of Gods people, but against the infidell <HI>Syrians;</HI> even as <HI>Amaziah</HI> was beginning to joyne with those of the ten Tribes against the <HI>Edomites.</HI> 4. The cause seemes to have been good, as <HI>Carthusian</HI> on 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 22. 3. and <HI>Lavater</HI> upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polit. Christ. lib 7. Cap. 1.</NOTE> 2 <HI>Chron:</HI> 19. 2. note. For <HI>Ramoth-Gilead</HI> was a city of refuge, pertaining to the <HI>Levites</HI> in the Tribe of <HI>Gad,</HI> and should have been restored by the King of <HI>Syria</HI> to <HI>Ahab,</HI> according to their Covenant, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 20. 34. <HI>Daneus&punc;</HI> brings that same example of <HI>Ahabs</HI> going up against <HI>Ramoth-Gilead,</HI> to prove that 'tis just to make warre against these who have broken Covenant with us. 5, <HI>Iehosaphats</HI> manner of proceeding, was pious
<PB N="180" REF="99">
in this respect, that he said to <HI>Ahab, enquire I pray thee of the word of the Lord to day,</HI> and again, <HI>is there not here a Prophet of the Lord besides,</HI> he enquireth <HI>ultr&agrave;,</HI> and seeks all the light he could there have in point of conscience from Prophets of the Lord, which makes it probable, that those 400. Prophets did not professe, or were not known to <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> to be Prophets of <HI>Baal;</HI> but were lookt upon as Prophets of the Lord, as <HI>Cajetan</HI> thinketh. Therefore they answer also in the name of the Lord, <HI>the Lord shall deliver it.</HI> 'Tis not likely that <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> would desire the Prophets of <HI>Baal</HI> to be consulted, or that hee would hearken to them more, then to the Prophet of the Lord <HI>Micajah,</HI> yet in this he failed extremly, that he had too far engaged himself to <HI>Ahab,</HI> before the enquiring at the word of the Lord. How ever it seemes, he was by this enquiring, seeking a faire way to come off againe. 6. <HI>Iehosaphats</HI> end was good, <HI>Martyr</HI> on 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 22. thinkes <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> entered in|to this confederacy with <HI>Ahab,</HI> for the peace and safety of his Kingdome, and to prevent a new War between <HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> such as had been between <HI>Asa</HI> his father, and <HI>Baasha</HI> King of <HI>Israel,</HI> for which end also <HI>Carthusian ibid.</HI> thinks that <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> took <HI>Ahabs</HI> daughter to his son. Yet notwithstan|ding of all this, the Prophet <HI>Iehu</HI> saith to him, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19. 2. <HI>Shouldest thou help the ungodly, or love them that hate the Lord.</HI> The LXX: read, <HI>hated of the Lord,</HI> which comes all to one thing. And least it should be thought a veniall or light mat|ter, headdeth, <HI>therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.</HI> So that from this example we learn; That let us keep our selves unspotted of the false Religion, or errors of those with whom we associate, let wicked men seem never so penitent, and our relations to them be never so near, let the common enemy be an Infidell, let the cause be never so good, let the manner of proceeding be never so pious, and the end also good; yet all this cannot excuse, nor justifie confederacies and associa|tions
<PB N="181" REF="99">
with wicked and ungodly men. And if God was so angry at <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> when there were so many things concur|ring, as might seem to excuse or extenuate his fault, it being also in him a sin of infirmity only, and not without a relucta|tion of conscience, and a conflict of the spirit against the flesh (which <HI>Pareus</HI> upon 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 22. doth well collect from his desire of enquiring at the word of the Lord, that hee might have occasion to come off) how much more will God bee angry with such as go on with an high hand in this trespasse, casting his word behind them, and hating to bee reformed.</P>
<P>If it be further objected, that we are not able without such confederacies, and help to prosecute a great war alone. This also the holy Ghost hath before hand answered, in the exam|ple of <HI>Ahaz</HI> his confederacy with the King of <HI>Assyria;</HI> for he had a great warre to manage, both against the <HI>Syrians,</HI> and a|gainst the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 16. 7. also against the <HI>Edo|mites</HI> and <HI>Philistims,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron:</HI> 28. 16, 17, 18. yet although he had so much to do, this could not excuse the confederacy with the <HI>Assyrian:</HI> he should have trusted to God, and not used unlawfull means. God can save by few, as well as by many; yea, sometimes God thinks not fit to save by many, <HI>Iud.</HI> 7. It shall not be the strength of battell, to have unlawfull confe|derats, but rather to want them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 23. 22.</P>
<P>If it be said, it is dangerous to provoke, and incense many wicked men by casting them off. This is plainly answered from the example of <HI>Amaziah,</HI> and the 100000. men of <HI>Israel</HI> with him, of which before. If furthermore objection bee made, that he must be gentle and patient towards all, and in meeknesse, instruct those that oppose themselves, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 24, 25. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. Yet hee bids us turne away from the wicked, <HI>ibid: Chap:</HI> 3. 5. Wee ought in meeknesse to instruct, even him that is excommunicate, 2 <HI>Thess:</HI> 3. 15. yet wee are there warned, <HI>vers:</HI> 14. to have no company with him. 2. The An|gel
<PB N="182" REF="100">
of the Church at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> is at on ecommended, both for his patience, and that he could not bear them which were evil.</P>
<P>I shall adde five distinctions which will take off all other ob|jections that I have yet met with. 1. Distinguish between a confederacy, which is more discretive, and discriminative and a confederacy which is more unitive. And here is the Reason why Covenants of peace and commerce, even with infidels and wicked persons are allowed, yet military associa|tions with such, disallowed: for the former keeps them, and us still divided as two: the latter unites us and them, as one, and imbodieth us together with them: for <HI>Thucidides</HI> defines <GAP DESC="foreign"> to be such a Covenant, as makes us and our confede|rates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keckerm|de Repub. Spart. disp. 4. lib. 2. Cap. 20.</NOTE> to have the same friends and enemies, and 'tis mentio|ned by writers, as a further degree of Uniou then <GAP DESC="foreign">, or Covenants of peace. 2. Distinguish between endeavour of duty, and the perfection of the things, which answeres that exception. <HI>O then, we must have an army all of Saints</HI> (it should be said, <HI>without any known wicked person in it;</HI>) Now even as 'tis our duty to endeavour a purging of the Church, from wicked and scandalous persons, yet when we have done all we can, the Lords field shall not be perfectly purged from tares, til the end of the world, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. So when wee have done all that ever we can, to avoid wicked persons in an expedition, yet we cannot be rid of them all; but we must use our utmost en|deavours, that we may be able to say, 'tis our affliction, not our fault. 3. Distinguish between some particular wicked persons, here and there mixing themselves with us; and be|tween a wicked faction, and Malignant party: The former should be avoided as much as is possible, but much more a con|junction with a wicked faction. <HI>David</HI> would by no means meet and consult with the <HI>Kahal meregnim,</HI> the Assembly of Malignants; neither did he onely shunne to meet and consult with <HI>vaine persons;</HI> who openly shew and bewray themselves;
<PB N="183" REF="100" MS="y">
but even <HI>with dissemblers,</HI> or (as the <HI>Chaldee</HI>) <HI>with those that hide themselves, that they may do evill,</HI> Psal. 26. 4, 5. We can know better how to doe with a whole field of tares, in which is no wheat, then we can do with tares growing here and there among the wheat. 4. Distinguish between such a fellowship with some wicked persons, as is necessary (which is the case of those that are married, and of parents and children) or unavoidable, which is the case of those, whose lot is to co|habite in one Town, or in one Family, in a case of necessity, travelling or sailing together; Distinguish, I say, between these and an elective, or voluntary fellowship with wicked men, when love to them, or our owne benefite draweth us thereunto. We neither loose naturall bonds, nor require im|possibilities, but that we keep our selves pure, by not choo|sing or consenting to such fellowship. 5. Distinguish between Infidels, Hereticks, wicked persons repenting, and those who go on in their trespasse: what ever men have been, yet as soone as the signes of repentance, and new fruits appeare in them, we are ready to receave them into favour and fellowship: Then indeed the Wolfe shall dwell with the Lambe, and the Cow and the Bear shall feed, their young ones shall lye down together, meaning, such as were Wolves, Leopards, Bears, and now begin to change their nature&punc; not so with the obstinate, contumacious, and impenitent, who still remaine Wolves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now, 1: Examine our selves, whether there bee so much tendernesse of conscience in us, as to close with those Scripture Truths, or whether we are still in a way of consul|ting with flesh and blood. 2. Be humbled for former miscar|riages, and failings in the particulars, and for not walking ac|curatly, according to these Scripture rules. 3. Beward for the future: remember and apply these rules, when we have to do with the practise of them: And that I may drive home
<PB N="184" REF="101">
this naile to the head: I adde, (beside what was said before) these Reasons and Motives. First, 'tis a great judgement when God <HI>mingleth a perverse Spirit</HI> in the midst of a people, <HI>Isay</HI> 19. 14. shall we then make that a voluntary act of our own, which the Word mentioneth as a dreadfull judgement? With this spirituall judgement, is oftentimes joyned a temporall judge|ment, as 2 <HI>Chren:</HI> 16. 9: and 20. 37. and 28&punc; 22. so <HI>Hos:</HI> 5. 13. 7, 8. compared with <HI>Hos:</HI> 8. 8, 9. Where their judgement, soundeth forth their sinne as by an Eccho: The <HI>Chaldee</HI> pa|raphrase in the place last cited, saith, <HI>The house of Israel is deli|vered into the hands of the people whom they loved.</HI> Secondly, remember what followed upon Gods peoples mingling them|selves with the heathen, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106. 35. <HI>They were mingled a|mong the heathen, and learned their works,</HI> Hos: 7. 8. Ephraim, <HI>he hath mixed himself among the people,</HI> that is, by making con|fe deracies with the heathen, (as <HI>Luther</HI> exponds the place) and by seeking their help and assistance, <HI>Hos:</HI> 5. 13. But what followes, <HI>Ephraim is a cake not turned,</HI> hote and overbaken in the nether side, but cold and raw in the upper side. This will prove the fruit of such confederacies and associations, to make us zealous for some earthly or humane thing, but remisse and cold in the things of Christ; to be too hote on our nether side, and too raw on the upper side. Whereas, not mingling our selves with the wicked: we shall through Gods mercy be like a cake turned, that heat and zeal which was before downward, shall now be upward, Heavenward, Godward, let it also bee remembred, how both <HI>Ahaz,</HI> 2. <HI>Kings</HI> 16. 10. and <HI>Asa</HI> him|self, 2 <HI>Chron:</HI> 16. 10. (though a good man) were drawn into other great sinnes, upon occasion of these associations, with the enemies of God and his people: this sinne will certainly ensnare men in other sinnes. 'Tis well said by <HI>Calvin</HI> upon <HI>Ezek:</HI> 16. 26. That as we are too prone of our selves to wick|ednesse, so when wee enter into confederacies with wicked
<PB N="185" REF="101">
men, we are but seeking new temptations, and as it were a bel|lows to blow up our own corruptions, as wine being mixed with water loseth of its spirits, and white being mixed with black, loseth much of its whitenesse: so the people of God, if once mixed with wicked enemies, shall certainly losse of their purity and integrity. Thirdly, as these unlawfull confederacies draw us both into great judgements and great sins, so into a great security and stupidity under these great plagues and sins, which will make the estate of such to be yet worse, <HI>Hos:</HI> 7, 9, after <HI>Ephraims</HI> mixing himself among the people, tis added, <HI>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not, yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth it not:</HI> al|though his confederats have distressed him, and not strength|ned him, and although there may be observed in him diverse signes of a decaying dying condition, yet he knowes it not, nor takes it to heart; The same thing is insisted upon <HI>vers:</HI> 11. <HI>Ephraim also is like a silly Dove without heart; They call to Egypt, they go up to Assyria.</HI> He is as voide of understanding as a silly Dove, whose nest being spoiled, and <HI>her young ones taken from her</HI> (which the <HI>Chaldee</HI> paraphrase addeth for explications cause) yet she still returneth to those places where, and among those people by whom she hath been so spoiled; So <HI>Israel</HI> will still be medling with those that have done him great hurt. Fourthly, we finde that such confederacy or association either with idolaters or known impious persons, is seldome or never recorded in the booke of God, without a reproofe, or some greater mark of Gods displeasure put upon it. If it were like the Polygamie of the Patriarchs, often mentioned and not re|proved, it were the lesse marvell to hear it so much debated. But now when God hath so purposely set so many Beacons upon those rocks, and Shelves that we may beware of them, O why shall we be so mad, as stil to run upon them? It was re|proved in the time of the Judges, <HI>Judg:</HI> 2, 1, 2, 3. It was repro|ved

<P>There is another Objection, which at the writing hereof I have met with: Tis <HI>Davids</HI> confederacy and association, both with <HI>Abner,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3. 12, 13. and with <HI>Amasa,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam:</HI> 19. 13. whom according to agreement he made Generall of his Hoste, 2 <HI>Sam:</HI> 20, 4. although both of them had been <HI>Davids</HI> ene|mies, and born armes against him, <HI>Abner</HI> being also scanda|lous, both for his whoredome, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3, 7. and his treachery against <HI>Ishbosheth</HI> in aspyring to the Crown (which is colle|cted
<PB N="187" REF="102">
from his going in unto <HI>Sauls</HI> Concubine, as <HI>Absolom</HI> did unto <HI>Davids</HI> afterward) yea for that he had born Arms against <HI>David,</HI> when he knew that God had sworne to make <HI>David</HI> King, and so against the light of his conscience, 2 <HI>Sam:</HI> 39, 18. Answ: 1 <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> commenting upon those places, dissa|loweth <HI>Davids</HI> practise in both these cases, especially his League with <HI>Abner.</HI> Should we follow these two examples, not being allowed or commended in Scripture? or should we not rather avoid such confederacies, because of many examples thereof, plainly condemned in the word of God? 2. What so|ever may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e conceived to be allowable or excusable in these examples of <HI>David,</HI> yet it cannot be applied, except in like cas|es. When <HI>David</HI> covenanted with <HI>Abner,</HI> he was but King of <HI>Judah, Abner</HI> undertakes to bring about all <HI>Israel</HI> to him, and that he should make him reigne over all the tribes, whereas otherwise there was no appearance of <HI>Davids</HI> subdueing of all the other tribes; but by a long and bloody Warre. Again, when <HI>David</HI> covenanted and capitulated with <HI>Amasa,</HI> he was in a manner fled out of the land for <HI>Absalom,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam:</HI> 19. 9. and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sanctius &amp; Corn. a Lapide in 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 19.</NOTE> was forced to abide in the land of <HI>Gilead</HI> beyond <HI>Jordan,</HI> fear|ing also (as interpreters observe) that the men of <HI>Iudah</HI> having strengthned <HI>Ierusalem</HI> and kept it with a garison for <HI>Absalom,</HI> and having done so much in assisting <HI>Absalom</HI> against <HI>David,</HI> should grow desperat in holding out against him, hoping for no mercy, therefore he is content to make <HI>Amasa</HI> Generall of his Army, upon condition that he would cause the men of <HI>Iu|dah</HI> to bring him back to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which <HI>Amasa</HI> moves the men of <HI>Iudah</HI> to do, 2 <HI>Sam:</HI> 19, 14; for it was done by his au|thority, as <HI>Iosephus</HI> also writeth, nor could it be done without<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiq. Jud. lib. 7. Cap. 10. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></NOTE> his authority, for <HI>Absalom</HI> and <HI>Ahitophel</HI> being dead, <HI>Amasa</HI> had the whole power and sole headship of that Army and of all that faction that had followed <HI>Absalom.</HI> Now then let them that will plead for the lawfullnesse of confederacies with wic|ked <PB N="188" REF="103">persons from these examples of <HI>David,</HI> first make the case alike, that is, that the wicked one have power of an Army, and of a great body of the Kingdom, to make them either continue in Rebellion and enmity, or to come in and submit. Next let it be remembred that both <HI>Abner</HI> and <HI>Amasa</HI> did a great service, (which was most meritorious at the hands of men) for the good, peace, and safety of King and Kingdom, and they did it at that time also when <HI>David</HI> was but weak, &amp; they had  power enough to have continued a War against him. Which is a very rare case, and far different from the case of such as have done and are doing all that they can to pervert and mislead many thousands of the people of God, instead of reducing many thousands to obedience; as <HI>Abner</HI> and <HI>Amasa</HI> did. 3. There are some other answers proper to the one  case and the other. There is nothing in the Text to prove, that <HI>Da|vid</HI> made such a Covenant with <HI>Abner,</HI> as the Grecians call <GAP DESC="foreign">, or that he Covenanted to make him Generall of his Army, (as afterwards he Covenanted with <HI>Amasa,</HI>) for at that time he could have no colour of reason for casting <HI>Ioab</HI> out of his place, as afterwards he had; Therefore I understand with <HI>Sanctius</HI> that the League which <HI>Abner</HI> sought from <HI>David,</HI> was <HI>Foedus pacis,</HI> a Covenant of Peace. <HI>Hierome</HI> readeth, <HI>fac mecum amicitias,</HI> make friendship with me, for before they had been enemies: So that this League is not of that kind which is chief|ly controverted. As for <HI>Amasa,</HI> I shall  not go about (as some have done) to excuse or extenuate his fault in joyning with <HI>Absalom,</HI> as not being from any malice or wicked intention a|gainst <HI>David</HI> his Uncle; But there is some probability that <HI>A|masa</HI> was a penitent and hopefull man. Sure <HI>David</HI> had better hopes of him, then of <HI>Ioab</HI>: And if it be true which <HI>Iosephus</HI> writeth, that before <HI>David</HI> sent <HI>Zadock</HI> and <HI>Abiathar</HI> to the men of <HI>Iudah,</HI> and to <HI>Amasa,</HI> frequent messages came from them to the King, desiring to be received into his favour; how <PB N="189" REF="103">ever <HI>Amasa</HI> being so willing and ready to do so much for <HI>Da|vid,</HI> when he might have done so much against him, <HI>David</HI> as he could not doe his businesse without him, so hee had some ground to hope well of him; considering withall, that <HI>Ama|sa</HI> was not set upon this business by any offence or displeasure at the other party, as <HI>Abner</HI> was. 4. Even as this example, so far as concerneth the laying aside, and casting off of <HI>Ioab,</HI> and not preferring his brother <HI>Abishai</HI> in his room (both of them being gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ty of <HI>Abners</HI> bloud, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3. 30. and both of them being too hard for <HI>David</HI>) helpeth to strengthen that which I have been pleading for.</P>
<P>The point being now so fully cleared from Scripture, here is the lesse reason to argue contrariwise from human exam|ples in Christian States and Common-wealths.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Mr. Fox. acts and monuments, vol. 2 pag. 86. 9. 870. edit. 1489.</NOTE> The word of God must not stoupe to mens practises, but they to it.

by a confederacy with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">erdinand</HI> the Emperours brother, so<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts and moun. ments, <HI>ubi supra</HI> pag. 872. <HI>Sleid.</HI> Com. lib. 7. pag. 106 110&punc; 120.</NOTE> the Protestant side, <HI>Zurik, Berne,</HI> and <HI>Basil</HI> entered into a con|federacy, first with the city of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> and shortly there|after with the <HI>Lantgrave</HI> of <HI>Hesse,</HI> that thereby they might bee strengthened, and aided against the Popish Cantons. The dif|ferences of Religion put them to it, to choose other confede|rates. Neverthelesse, I can easily admit what <HI>Lavater</HI> judici|ously observeth, upon <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 26, 27, 28, 29. that Cove|nants made before true Religion did shine among a people, are not to be rashly broken; even as the beleeving husband, ought not to put away the unbeleiving wife, whom he married when himself also was an unbeleever, if she be willing still to abide with him. Whatsoever may be said for such Covenants, yet confederacies with enemies of true Religion, made after the light of Reformation, are altogether unexcusable.</P>
<P>Peradventure some have yet another Objection: this is an hard saying (say divers Malignants) we are looked upon as enemies, if we come not in and take the Covenant, and when we are come in and have taken the Covenant, wee are still e|steemed enemies to the cause of God, and to his servants. <HI>Answ.</HI> This is just, as if those traitors, Covenant breakers, and other scandalous persons, from which the Apostle bids us turne away, 2 <HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 5. had objected, if we have no forme of Godlinesse, we are looked upon as aliens, and such as are not to be numbered among Gods people, yet now when wee have taken on a forme of godlinesse, we are in no better esteem with <HI>Paul,</HI> but still he will have Christians to turne away from us: Yea, 'tis as if workers of iniquity living in the true Church, should object against Christ himself, if we pray not, if wee hear not the word, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we are not accepted, but rejected for the neglect of necessary duties, yet when wee have prayed, heard, <HI>&amp;c:</HI> we are told for all that: <HI>Depart from me yee wor|kers of iniquity, I never knew you.</HI> Men must bee judged ac|cording
<PB N="191" REF="104">
to their fruits, according to their words and works, and course of living; and if any who have taken the Covenant, shew themselves in their words and actions, to be still wicked enemies, our eyes must not bee put out with their hand at the Covenant.</P>
<P>If any disaffected shall still insist and say; But why then are we receaved, both to the Covenant and to the Sacrament, nay, why are wee forced and compelled into the Covenant. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. If any known Malignant, or complier with the Rebels, or with any enemy of this Cause hath been receaved, either to the Covenant or Sacrament, without signes of repen|tance for the former Malignancy, and scandale (such signes of Repentance, I mean, as men in charity ought to be satisfied with,) 'tis more then Ministers and Elderships can answer, either to God, or the Acts and constitutions of this nationall Church. I trust all faithfull and conscientious Ministers have laboured to keep themselves pure in such things. Yea, the Generall Assembly hath ordained, that known compliers with the Rebels, and such as did procure protections from the ene|my, or keep correspondence and intelligence with him, shall be suspended from the Lords-supper, till they manifest their repentance before the Congregation. Now if any after signes, and declaration of repentance, have turned again to their old wayes of Malignancy, their iniquity bee upon themselves, not upon us. 2. Men are no otherwise drawn or forced into the Covenant, then into other necessary duties. Nay it ought not to be called a forceing or compelling. Are men forced to spare their neighbours life, because murther is severly pu|nished? Or are men compelled to be loyall, because traitors are examplarily punished? There may, and must be a willing|nesse and freenesse in the doing of the contrary duty; although great sinnes must not go away unpunished. Men are not com|pelled to vertue, because vice is punished, else vertue were not
<PB N="192" REF="105">
vertue. Those that refuse the Covenant, reproach it, or rail against it, ought to be looked upon as enemies to it, and dealt with accordingly: yet if any man were knowne to take the Covenant against his will, he were not to be receaved. 3. These two may well stand together, to censure the contempt or neglect of a duty, and withall to censure wickednesse in the person that hath taken up the practise of the dutie. If any <HI>Israelite</HI> would not worship the true God, hee was to be put to death, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15. 13. but withall, if worshipping the true God, hee was found to bee a murtherer, an adulterer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for this also hee was to bee put to death. The Generall Assembly of this Church hath appointed, that such as after admonition, continue in an usuall neglect of Prayer, and the Worship of God in their families, shall bee suspended from the Lords-Supper, till they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mend: Yet if any man shall be found to make Familie Worship a cloak to his swearing, drun|kennesse; adultery or the like, must these scandalous sinnes be uncensured, because hee hath taken upon him a forme of godlinesse? God forbid. 'Tis just so here, refusers of the Covenant, and railers against it, are justly censured: But withall, if wickednesse and Malignancie, be found in any that have taken the Covenant; their offence and censure is not to be extenuated, but to be aggravated.</P>
<P>I had been but very short in the handling of this question, if new objections coming to my eares, had not drawn me forth to this length. And now I finde one objection more. Some say, the arguments before brought from Scripture, prove not the unlawfulnesse of confederacies, and associations with Ido|laters, Heretickes, or prophane persons of the same King|dome, but onely with those of another Kingdome. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Then by the concession of those that make the objection, 'tis at least unlawfull, to associate our selves with any of ano|ther Kingdome, who are of a false Religion, or wicked life.
<PB N="193" REF="105">
2. If familiar fellowship, even with the wicked of the same Kingdome be unlawfull, then is a military association with them unlawfull; for it cannot be without consulting, con|ferring, conversing frequently together. It were a prophane abusing, and mocking of Scripture to say, that we are forbid|den to converse familiarly with the ungodly of another king|dome, but not with the ungodly of the same kingdome, or that we are forbidden to marry with the ungodly of another Kingdome, but not with the ungodly of the same Kingdom, for what is this, but to open a wide gate upon the one hand; while wee seem to shut a narrow gate upon the other hand? 3. Were not those military associations, 2 <HI>Chron&punc;</HI> 19. 2. and 25. 7, 8. condemned upon this reason, because the associats were ungodly, haters of the Lord, and because God was not with them. Now then, <HI>&agrave; quatenus ad omne,</HI> the reason holds equally against associations with any, of whom it can be truly said, they are ungodly, haters of the Lord, and God is not with them. 4. God would have the Camp of <HI>Israel</HI> altogether holy and clean, <HI>Deut.</HI> 23. 9. to 14&punc; clean from whom? not so much from wicked heathens (there was not so much fear of that) as from wicked <HI>Israelites.</HI> 5.

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of uniformity in Religion, worship of God, and Church Govern|ment.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe word <HI>Vniformity</HI> is become als odious to divers who plead for Liberty and Tolleration, as the word <HI>Conformity</HI> was in the Prelats times. Hence proceed|ed M^r <HI>Delles</HI> book against uniformity, and M^r <HI>Bur|tons</HI> book, intituled, <HI>Conformities deformity.</HI> I confesse my love and desire of uniformity hath not made mee any whit to de|part from my former principles against the Prelaticall con|formity, or the astricting of mens consciences (at least in point of practise and observation) to certain rites, whether unlawful or indifferent in their own nature, under pain of censure. Yet I must needs justifie (as not only lawfull, but laudable) what the solemne League and Covenant of the three Kingdoms, ob|ligeth us unto, namely to endeavour to bring the Churches of God in the three Kingdomes to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in one Confession of Faith, one Directory of Wor|ship, one forme of Church Government and Catechisme.</P>
<P>It is alwayes to be remembred, that good things, yea the best things may be dangerously abused by the corruptions of Men, especially when the times are generally corrupted. <HI>Lu|ther</HI> had reason in his time, and as the case stood then, to de|cline a generall Synod of Protestants for unity in ceremonies (which some moved for) before the doctrine of Faith, and the substance of the Gospell was setled. He said the name of Sy|nods and Counsels was almost als much suspected with him, as the name of free will, and that he would have the Churches freely and voluntarly to comply and conforme in externall rites, by following the best examples in these things, but by
<PB N="195" REF="106">
no means to be compelled to it, or snares prepared for the consciences of the weak. See <HI>Melchior Adamus in vit: Lutheri pag:</HI> 128, 129. But if <HI>Luther</HI> had found als good opportunity and als much possibility of attayning a right uniformity in Church government and Worship, as God vouchsafeth us in this age, I do not doubt, but he had been more zealous for it, then any of us now are, or if hee had been in <HI>Calvins</HI> stead, I make no question he had done in this businesse as <HI>Calvin</HI> did. So that we ought to impute it rather to their times and places in which they lived, then to the difference of their Spirits, that <HI>Luthers</HI> zeal was wholly spent upon the doctrine of Free grace. <HI>Calvins</HI> zeal did also extendit self to Discipline, about which <HI>Luther</HI> was unwilling to make any busines at all. But for fur|ther satisfaction to truly tender consciences, and that they may not fear we are leading them back again to Egypt, I desire that these particular differences between the Prelaticall Confor|mity, and the Presbyteriall uniformity according to the Co|venant, may be well observed.</P>
<P>First, they did after the Heathenish and Popish maner affe|ctat ceremonies, and a Pompous externall splendor and specta|bility, and made the Kingdome of God come with observati|on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mentes humanae mirifice c piuntur &amp; fascina~|tur ceremo nialium splendore &amp; p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mpa Hospin: epist: ante lib de orig: monacho.</NOTE> We desire to retain only the ancient Apostolicall simplici|ty and singlenesse, and we conceive the fewer ceremonies, the better, knowing that the minds of people are thereby invea|gled and distracted from the spirituall and inward duties.</P>
<P>2. Much of the Prelaticall Conformity consisted in such things as were in themselves &amp; in their own nature unlawful, and contrary to the word. Shew us the like in any part of our uniformity, then let that thing never more be heard of. Uni|formity in any thing which is unlawfull is a great aggravati|on of the sin.</P>
<P>3 They conformed to the Papists, we to the example of
<PB N="196" REF="107">
the best reformed Churches, which differeth als much fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m their way, as she that is dressed like other honest women diste|reth from her that is dressed like a whore.</P>
<P>4. The Prelatical conformity was for the most part made up of sacred ceremonies, which had been grossely and noto|riously abused either to Idolatry or Superstition, and therefore being things of no necessary use, ought not to have been con|tinued, but abolished as the brazen serpent was by <HI>Hezekiah.</HI></P>
<P>But in our uniformity now excepted against, I know no such thing (and I am confident no man can give instance of any such thing in it) as a sacred Religious rite or thing which hath neither from Scripture nor nature any necessary use, and hath been notoriously abused to idolatry or superstition, if a|ny such thing can be found, I shall confesse it ought not to be continued.</P>
<P>5. They imposed upon others and practised themselves ce|remonies (acknowledged by themselves to be in their own na|ture meerly indifferent, but looked upon by many thousands of godly people, as unlawfull and contrary to the word) to the great scandall and offence of their brethren. Our principle is, that things indifferent ought not to be practised with the scan|dall and offence of the godly.</P>
<P>6. Their way was destructive to true Christian Liberty both of Conscience and practise, compelling the practise and con|science it self, by the meer will and authority of the Law-ma|kers. <HI>Obedite praepositis</HI> was the great argument with them to sa|tisfie consciences, <HI>Sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas.</HI> We say that no Canons nor constitutions of the Church can bind the conscience <HI>nisi per &amp; propter verbum Dei, i.e.</HI> except in so far as they are grounded upon and warrantable by the word of God, at least by consequence, and by the Generall rules there|of. And that Canons concerning things indifferent bind not <HI>extra casum scandali &amp; contemptus, i,e.</HI> when they may be omit|ted
<PB N="197" REF="107">
without giving scandall, or shewing any contempt of the Ecclesiasticall authority.</P>
<P>7. The Prelaticall ordinances were <HI>after the commandements and Doctrines of men,</HI> as the Apostle speaks, <HI>Col:</HI> 2, 22. compare <HI>Mat:</HI> 15. 9. <HI>But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandements of men.</HI> Where <HI>doctrines</HI> may fitly expresse the nature of significant mysterious ceremonies (such as was the Pharisaicall washing of hands, cups, tables, &amp;c. to teach and signifie holines) all sacred significant ceremonies of mans devysing, we condemne as an addition to the word of God, which is forbidden no lesse then a diminution from it. Let ma|ny of those who object against our uniformity, examine whe|ther their own way hath not somewhat in it, which is a sacred significant ceremony of humane invention, and without the word; for instance, the anointing of the sick in these dayes when the miracle is ceased, the Church Covenant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For our part, except it be a circumstance, such as belongeth to the decency and order, which ought to appear in all humane societies and actions whether civill or sacred, we hold that the Church hath not power to determine or enjoyne any thing belonging to Religion: And even of these circumstances we say that al|though they be so numerous and so various, that all circum|stances belonging to all times and places could not be particu|larly determined in Scripture, yet the Church ought to order them so, and hath no power to order them otherwise, then as may best agree with the generall rules of the Word. Now set|ting aside the circumstantials, there is not any substantiall part of the uniformity according to the Covenant, which is not either expresly grounded upon the word of God, or by neces|sary consequence drawn from it, and so no commandement of men, but of God.</P>
<P>Other differences I might adde, but these may abundantly suffice to shew that the Prelaticall conformity and the Presby|terian
<PB N="198" REF="108">
uniformity are no lesse contrary one to another, then darknes and light, black and white, bitter and sweet, bad and good.</P>
<P>And now having thus cleared the true nature and notion of Uniformity, that its altogether another thing from that which its opposers apprehend it to be, the work of arguing for it may be the shorter and easier, M^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, <HI>Dell</HI> in his discourse against uni|formity, argueth against it both from nature and from Scrip|ture. I confesse if one will <HI>transire de genere in genus,</HI> as he doth, its easie to find a disconformity between one thing and ano|ther, either in the works of Creation, or in the things recorded in Scripture. But if one will look after uniformity <HI>in uno &amp; eodem genere,</HI> in one and the same kind of things (which is the uniformity we plead for) then both nature &amp; Scripture giveth us presidents not against uniformity, but for it. It is a maxime in naturall Philosophy, that <HI>motus Coeliest semper uniformis ve|locitate,</HI> the Heavens do not move sometime more slowly, sometime more swiftly, but ever uniformly. God himself tels us of the sweet influences of <HI>Pleiades,</HI> of the bands of <HI>Orion,</HI> of the bringing foorth of <HI>Mazaroth</HI> in his season, and of the o|ther ordinances of Heaven, which all the power on earth can|not alter nor put out of course, <HI>Iob</HI> 38, 31, 32, 33. of the sea which is shut up within the decreed place, &amp; within the doors and barres which it cannot passe, <HI>vers:</HI> 10, 11. And generally all the great works which God doeth there discourse of, each of them in its own kinde is uniforme to it self: So likewise, <HI>Psal:</HI> 104.

<P>As for Scripture presidents, There was in the old Testa|ment a marvelous great uniformity both in the substantialls and rituals of the worship and service of God. For instance, <HI>Num.</HI> 9. 3.

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Whether it be lawfull, just, and expedient, that there be an ordinance of Parliament, for the taking of the solemne League and Cove|venant, by all persons in the Kingdome, under a considerable penaltie. Or an answer returned to a Gentleman, who had con|sulted a friend concerning this question.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_FIrst of all, that I may rightly deduce and state the matter of fact, 'tis to be remembred.</P>
<P>That the solemne League and Covenant hath been the strongest band of Union in this common cause of Religion and Liberty, and that which the common enemies, have mainly endeavoured with all their might to over|throw.</P>
<P>That the chief motive to engage <HI>Scotland,</HI> was professed to
<PB N="202" REF="110">
be the Reformation of Religion, and uniformity according to the Covenant.</P>
<P>That the League and Treaty between the two Kingdomes, is in pursuance of the ends of the Covenant, especially the a|forsaid ends of Religion.</P>
<P>That the declaration of both Kindomes, emitted to other Nations, doeth hold forth to the world, that our war is for the ends of the Covenant, and that we should never lay down armes, till these were obtained.</P>
<P>That by order of Parliament, the Covenant was turned in Latine, and sent abroad to the reformed Churches, with letters from the Assembly of Divines.</P>
<P>That upon the former assurances, the Church and King|dome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Parliaments of both Kingdomes, the Assembly of Divines, the city of <HI>London,</HI> and many thousands in <HI>England,</HI> have taken the Covenant, and have sworne most solemnly, that they shall constantly, really, and sincerly, du|ring all the dayes of their lifetime, with their lives and for|tunes, stand to the performance of it. And both Kingdomes have suffered the losse of their goods chearfully, laid out their means, and laid downe their lives resolutly in pursuance thereof.</P>
<P>At the Treaty of <HI>Vxbridge,</HI> the propositions for Religion (of which the confirming of the Covenant, is the first and chiefest) were acknowledged to be of such excellency, and absolute necessity, as they were appointed to be treated of in the first place, and that no peace nor agreement should be, till they were first agreed unto.</P>
<P>The same Propositions for Religion, are yet set down in the first place amongst the Propositions sent last to the King, as being agreed unto by the Parliaments of both King|domes.</P>
<P>And that now the Kings answer to the Propositions is de|layed,
<PB N="203" REF="110">
the house of Commons have thought fit, to turne the Propositions into Ordinances, to shew their constant resoluti|on of adhering thereto, and that they may be of greater force, and receave the better obedience from the Subjects, have con|verted the Propositions for civill matters into Ordinances, and (that their zeal and constancy may appear for Religion, which is of greatest moment, and wherein the glory of God, and the good of his Church is most concerned) it is desired, that the Propositions concerning the Covenant, may be likewise tur|ned into an ordinance, with a considerable penalty, that so we may give some reall evidence, that we do not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ek the things of this world in the first place, and the Kingdome of Heaven, and the righteousnesse of it in the last; Much lesse, that <HI>Demas&punc;</HI> like we forsake it as lovers of this present world.</P>
<P>Now the grounds and reasons for such an Ordinance may be these.</P>
<P>1. It were a great unthankfulnsse to God, if after sacred and solemne vowes made in time of our greatest dangers, and when after our vowes, God hath begun to deliver us, and hath dis|sipated our Enemies, we should now grow wearie of paying, and performing those vowes. We may say of the Covenant, as the Prophet said of the laying of the foundation of the se|cond Temple. Consider whether from that very day God did not sensibly blesse us, and give a testimony from Heaven, to his own Cause and Covenant. And now shall the Cove|nant which was our glory and ornament before God and men, be laid aside as a worne or moth-eaten garment? God forbid.</P>
<P>2. If the taking of the solemne League and Covenant, bee not enjoyned by authority of Parliaments, under a penalty, but left arbitrary, this were an opening in stead of shutting of the doore unto as many as are apt and inclinable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o refuse and
<PB N="204" REF="111">
oppose the Covenant, yea, to as many as write or speak against it, and maintaine opinions or practises contrary to it. The impiety and obstinacy of such persons, if not punished, but connived at, or tacitely permitted by the Parliaments, invol|veth them and the Nation as partakers of the sinne, and so consequently of the judgement.</P>
<P>Although the oath which <HI>Ioshua</HI> and the Princes of Israel made to the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> was made unadvisedly, and without asking counsell from the mouth of the Lord, yet some hun|dred yeares after being broken, that breach brought a nationall judgement, till justice was done upon the offenders. How much more may a Nationall judgement bee feared, if even in our dayes the contempt and violation of a most lawfull and sa|cred oath, bee winked at? Surely God will not wink at their sinne, who wink at his dishonour. Better not to have vow|ed, then not to pay and performe.</P>
<P>3. When King <HI>Iosiah</HI> made a solemne Covenant (the effect whereof was a through Reformation, the taking away of the ancient and long continued high places, the destroying of <HI>Baals</HI> Vessels, Altars, Priests, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 23. through out) he did not leave this Covenant arbitrary: <HI>But he caused all that were present in Ierusalem, and Benjamine to stand to it,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 34. 32. In all which he is set forth as a president to Christian Refor|mers, that they may know their duety in like cases.</P>
<P>4. All who did take the solemne League and Covenant are thereby obleiged in their severall places and callings (and so the houses of Parliament in their place and calling) to endea|vour the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, Heresie, Schisme, Superstition, and Prophannesse. How is this part of the oath of God fulfilled, if the Covenant it selfe, made for the extirpati|on of all these, be left arbitrary?</P>
<P>5. The Vow and Protestation was not left arbitrary. For by the vote, <HI>Iuly</HI> 30. 1641. it was resolved upon the que|stion,
<PB N="205" REF="111">
that whosoever would not take that Protestation, are declared to be unfit to bear any office in the Church or State, which was accordingly published. But the solemne League and Covenant must be at least more effectuall then the Pro|testation, for the narrative, or preface of the Covenant, hol|deth forth the necessity of the same, as a more effectuall means to be used, after other means of Supplication, Remonstrance, and Protestation.</P>
<P>6. This same solemne League and Covenant was not in the beginning left arbitrary, for some members were suspended from the house, for not taking it. And in the Ordinance, 2 <HI>Feb.</HI> 1643. it is ordained and enjoyned, that it be solemnly taken in all places throughout the Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> and dominion of <HI>Wales.</HI> And withall, in the instructions and or|ders of Parliament, then sent into the Committees, it was appointed that the names of such as refuse it, should be retur|ned to the Parliament, that they may take such further course with them, as they shall thinke fit. In the Ordinance of Par|liament, for Ordination of Ministers, (both the first and the last Ordinance) the person to be ordained, is appointed and obleiged to addresse himself to the Presbyterie: <HI>and bring with him a testimony of his taking the Covenant of the three King|domes.</HI> Again, by the ordinance for election of Elders, dated the 19. of <HI>Aug:</HI> 1645. No member of any Congregation, may concurre or have voice in the choosing of Elders, but such as have taken the Nationall Covenant.</P>
<P>7. In the first Article of the Treaty between the King|domes, signed <HI>Novemb:</HI> 29. 1643. 'Tis agreed and conclu|ded, that the Covenant bee sworne and subscribed by both Kingdomes, not that it shall bee taken by as many as will in both Kingdomes, but that it shall bee taken by both King|domes. How shall this be performed, if it bee still left arbi|trary?</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="112">8. In the Propositions of peace, 'tis plainly supposed and intimated, that the taking of the Covenant shall bee enjoyned under some penalty. Otherwise we have not delt faithfully, neither with God nor man, in tendering that second Propo|sition to the King, concerning his consent to an act of Parlia|ment in both Kingdomes respectively, for the enjoyning the taking of the Covenant, by all the Subjects of the three King|domes with such penalties as by mutuall advice of both King|domes, shall be agreed upon.</P>
<P>9. If other Propositions of peace be turned into Ordinan|ces, and this of the Covenant not so, it will strengthen the calumnies cast upon the Parliament by the Malignant party, that they have had no intention to setle Religion according to the Covenant, but that they entred into the Covenant for bringing in the <HI>Scots</HI> to their assistance, and for gaining the good opinion of the reformed Churches.</P>
<P>10. It will also be a dangerous president to separat between the legislative power, and the corrective or punitive power. For if after the ordinance of Parliament injoyning and or|daining that the Covenant be taken universally throughout the whole Kingdome, there be no sanction nor penalty upon these who shall refuse it, let wise men judge, whether this may not expose the authority of Parliament to contempt.</P>
<P>11 I shal conclud with this Syllogisme, That which is not on|ly sinful in it self, but a great dishonour to God, a great scandall to the Church, &amp; with all a disobedience to the lawfull Ordi|nance of authority, may and ought to be punished, by this Christian and reforming Parliament. But their offence which still refuse to take the Covenant, is not only sinfull in it self, but a great dishonour to God, a great scandall to the Church, and with all a disobedience to the lawful Ordinance of Autho|rity.</P>
<P>Therefore the offence of these who still refuse to take the
<PB N="207" REF="112">
Covenant, may and ought to be punished by this Christian and reforming Parliament.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Objections answered.</HEAD>
<P>1. <HI>Object.</HI> The Covenant ought not to be compulsory but free: Good things grow evill when mens consciences are thereunto forced&punc; <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. An Ordinance injoyning the taking of it under a certain penalty, were no other compulsion, then was used by King <HI>Iosiah</HI> and others, yea by this present Parlia|ment upon their own Members, and upon Ministers to be or|dained, as is evident by the passages above expressed. The Par|liament hath also by their Ordinance dated the 23. of <HI>August</HI> 1645. imposed the Directory of Worship under certain mulcts and penalties to be inflicted upon such as do not observe it, or preach or write against it. 2. Tis no tyranny overmens consci|ences, to punish a great and scandalous sin (such as the refusing and opposing of the Covenant, or a divyding from it) althogh the offender in his conscience believe it to be no sin, yea perad|ventur believe it to be a duety. Otherwise it had been tyranny over the Conscience to punish those who killed the Apostles, because they thought they were doing God good service, <HI>Ioh:</HI> 16, 2. Thirdly, if they who make this Objection be so tender of mens consciences, why would they keep up an Army when there is no Enemy, and continue taxes and burthens upon the exhausted Counties, which are altogether against the consci|ences of the generality of people in the Kingdome. If in these things they will have the conscience of any to be forced, and in the Covenant the consciences of some left at liberty, this is not fair and equall, and it will be generally apprehended, that such men study their own interest more then the Publick.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Object:</HI> The Covenant was occasionall, and temporary, being made upon the occasion of the prevalency and growing power of the Enemy (as is mentioned in the narrative) which fundation being taken away, the superstructure cannot stand.
<PB N="208" REF="113">
<HI>Answ.</HI> 1. <HI>Ex malis moribus bonae nascuntur Leges.</HI> Shall wee therefore be no longer bound to obey and maintaine good lawes, because the evils which gave occasion to their making have ceased. 2. The Covenant doth in expresse words oblige us constantly, and all the dayes of our lives, to pursue the ends therein expressed. So that to hold it but a Temporary obliga|tion is a breach of Covenant. 3. There is not any one of the ends of the Covenant which is yet fully attained. The very Directory of Worship is not observed in most places of the Kingdome. Neither is the abolitione of Prelacy, and of the Book of common prayer yet established by Act of Parlia|ment. 4. If we had attained the ends of the Covenant (which we have not) yet <HI>non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri,</HI> and the recidivation may prove worse then the first disease.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Object.</HI> Some things in the Covenant are disputable, for instance, good and learned men differ in their opinions about Prelacy. <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. The oath of Supremacy was much more disputable, and great disputs there were among good and learned men about it, yet it hath been imposed upon all Mem|bers of Parliament. 2. If the very materials of the Covenant be stuck at, whether they be good in themselves, there is the greater danger to leave all men to abound in their own sense, concerning things of the highest consequence.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Object:</HI> The Army which hath served us so faithfully and regained our Liberties, shall by this Ordinance loose their own greatest Liberty, which is the Liberty of their consciences&punc; <HI>Answ:</HI> 1. In the Ordinance and Instructions of Parliament dated the 2 <HI>Feb:</HI> 1643. It was ordained that the Covenant should be speedily sent to my Lord Generall, and the Lord Admirall, and all other Commanders in Cheiff, Governours of Towns, &amp;c. to the end it may be taken by all Officers and Souldiers under their command. I hope the Parliament did not here take from their Army the Liberty of their consciences.
<PB N="209" REF="113">
2. The Army must either take Lawes from the Parliament, or give Laws to the Parliament. If they will as the Parliaments servants, submit themselves to the Ordinances of the Parlia|ment (which hath ever been professed they would doe) then the objection is taken away. But if they will be the Parliaments Masters or fellows, and Independent upon the Parliament it self, and at libertie to reject as they list so good or wholesome an Ordinance a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the taking of the Covenant, then God have mercy upon us, if the Parliament doe not preserve their owne rights and priviledges, with which the Kingdome hath en|trusted them. 3. If an Ordinance imposing the taking of the Covenant under a considerable penaltie, be to the Army <HI>scan|dalum acceptum.</HI> The not passing of such an Ordinance will be <HI>scandalum datum</HI> to the city of <HI>London,</HI> and to many thousands of the godly and well affected of the Kingdome, both Mini|sters and People, who have faithfully adhered to, and served the Parliament, and will still hazard their lives and fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tunes in pursuance of the ends of the Covenant; yea, a horrible scan|dall to the reformed Churches abroad, whose hearts were once comforted and raised up to expect better things. 4. God forbid, there be any such in the houses of Parliament, as would admit of deformation instead of Reformation, and all maner of confusion in place of government. Would not this be the ready way to banish all Religion, and open a door for all sorts of Schisme and Haeresie? And shal this be the fruits of the Labours, blood and expences of the three Kingdomes, in place of Reformation and Uniformity, to admit of such a Li|berty and horrible confusion? Let it not be told in <HI>Gath,</HI> nor published in <HI>Askelon,</HI> least the <HI>Philistims</HI> rejoice, least the daugh|ters of the uncircumcised triumph.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of Infant Baptisme.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_MAster <HI>Tombes</HI> in his Apology for the two Treatises, and appendix concerning Infant Baptisme, inserts a letter to M^r. <HI>Selden, pag.</HI> 90. in which he intimateth his opinion, that Paedobaptisme did not succeed in|to the roome of circumcision, wherein he saith, hee was the more confirmed, having read of Baptisme, used among the Jews before the time of <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> in their admitting of Prose|lytes, and that therefore <HI>Iohn</HI> was not accused for Baptizing, as if that had been a Novation or new rite introduced, but for Baptizing without authority.</P>
<P>I do not marvell that M^r. <HI>Tombes</HI> is so cautious, that Bap|tisme should not be thought to succeed into the roome of cir|cumcision, for so he should make baptisme more like to the circumcision of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who are not circumcised, till they be 13. years old (as <HI>Zonaras Annal. tom.</HI> 1. <HI>de rebus Iu|daicis, pag:</HI> 13. tels us) because their forefather <HI>Ishmael</HI> was circumcised about that age, then to the circumcision of the eight day, ordinarly used among the people of God under the old Testament. For my part, I think the Apostle, <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 11, 12, doth plainly hold forth, that baptisme hath succeeded in|to the roome of circumcision: which is also the common and receaved opinion of Divines. However, because M^r. <HI>Tombes</HI> doth rather think that the Christian baptisme, succeedeth to that baptisme used among the Jews in their admission of Pro|selytes, this hath Ministred occasion to mee, to apply my thoughts, to search a little into the Originall of Baptisme by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ater, and whether the Originall thereof, or that which God
<PB N="211" REF="114">
had respect unto in the institution thereof, maketh any thing against, or for Infant-baptisme.</P>
<P>That Baptizing with water is a divine institution, is plaine from <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 33. <HI>Hee that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, &amp;c.</HI> As for that which this institution had reference unto in the old Testament, or Jewish customs, first of all consider <HI>Ezech.</HI> 16. 4. <HI>As for thy nativity in the day thou wast borne, thy navell was not cut, neither was thou washed in water to supple thee, &amp;c.</HI> Where the <HI>Chaldee</HI> saith, <HI>The Congregation of</HI> Israel <HI>was like unto a childe cast out into the open field, whose navell is not cut, and it is not washed in water, that it might be cleansed.</HI> The <HI>Sep|tuagint</HI> whom <HI>Hierome</HI> followeth, <HI>and thou art not washed in wa|ter unto salvation.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>in salutem.

Quod quidem non solum de Haereticis, sed de Ecclesiasticis intelligi potest; qui non plena fide accipiunt Baptismum salutare.</NOTE> Baptisme, as being necessary even to Infants who are in their bloud and siufull pollution, and have therefore need to bee washed in the Laver of regeneration, and baptized.</P>
<P>Not onely the Hebrews, but the Heathens had a custome of washing Infants soon after their birth, in those hote coun|tries. Hence that of <HI>Virgil. lib.</HI> 9. <HI>Aeneid.</HI>&mdash;</P>

<P><PB N="212" REF="115">In the next place consider, that as the institution of Bap|tisme by water related to that in <HI>Ezech:</HI> 16. 4. So also to the Typicall Baptisme of all the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> men, women, and children in the red sea, and in the cloud, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 10. 1. 2. <HI>Moreover brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea. And were all baptized unto</HI> Moses <HI>in the cloud and the sea.</HI> The Apostle speaking there of the Church which was brought out of Egypt (whom he calls our fathers, because they were the people and Church of God long before us, and from them the law and service of God was transmitted and propagated to us) sheweth that as their Sacraments could not profit them to salvation, they living in sinne and provoking God after they had receaved those Sacraments, no more can our Sacra|ments profit us, if wee sinne as they did. For their privi|ledges were the same with ours. The Manna and Water out of the Rocke was the same for substance and signification to them, which the Supper of the Lord is to us; the same spi|rituall meat, the same spirituall drinke was given both to them and us. So likewise their passing through the Sea, and un|der the cloud was the very same for substance and significati|on with our Baptisme, and they were externally baptized with a true Sacrament of Baptisme, as well as wee. That Baptisme of theirs, did fitly resemble this Baptisme of ours in diverse respects. For instance. 1. They were first brought out of Egypt before they were brought through the sea, so we are first redeemed by Christ, and finde grace and favour in his eyes, before we receave the seals of the Covenant of grace. Baptisme is intended onely for the redeemed of the Lord. 2. They were baptized unto <HI>Moses,</HI> (or as the <HI>Syriak,</HI> and <HI>Arabik,</HI> as likewise <HI>Augustine,</HI> by <HI>Moses</HI>) that is, <HI>Moses</HI> was the leader and commander of the people, (so <HI>Theophylact</HI>) and hee the Captaine of their salvation, or rather <HI>Moses</HI> was a typicall
<PB N="213" REF="115">
Mediatour typifying Christ; or they were baptized unto <HI>Moses,</HI> that is, they were by Baptisme dedicated and consecrated to that Doctrine, Covenant, promise of life, faith and obedi|ence, which God revealed by the hand of <HI>Moses.</HI> So are we baptized unto Christ, or unto his death, and the benefits and fruits thereof. The same Covenant of grace for substance, was sealed by their Baptisme and ours. 3. That Baptisme of theirs did visibly separat between them and the Egyptians: for the cloud divided them from the Egyptians, and the Sea drowned the Egyptians. So our Baptisme, which is unto us a token of Salvation, is unto aliens and those without, a token of perdition, and distinguisheth between the Church and the rest of the world. 4. Their Baptisme was by water, both in the sea and cloud (it being also probably conceaved that they were sprinkled with drops both of the sea and cloud) so is ours by water. 5. The sea resembleth the water, the cloud resembleth the Spirit in our Baptisme. So <HI>Athanasius.</HI> that is beside the water in Baptisme, the Spirit is also powred out from on high, and there is an influence of grace from above, according to the good pleasure of Gods will, upon so many as are ordained to eternall life. That the cloud did typifie the Spirit was <HI>Damascens</HI> observation, who is herein followed by some interpreters. 6. They passed but once through the red sea; but the cloud continued alwayes with them in the wildernesse. So the externall Baptisme is a transient action, and but once used to one person, not reiterated; but the Spirit and gracious presence of God continueth ever with them in this world. 7. They passed through the sea, and were under the cloud, and so baptized, before they did eat of the Manna, or drink of water out of the Rocke, so must wee bee baptized, before we be fit to receave the Lords supper. 8. All that were baptized in the sea and cloud, were not acceptable to God, for with many of them God was not well pleased, and
<PB N="116" REF="116">
he sware in his wrath, that they should not enter into his rest; so of those that are now baptized, many are excluded from the heavenly <HI>Canaan.</HI></P>
<P>For these and the like respects the Apostle compareth, pa|ralelleth and equalleth their Sacramentall priviledge of Bap|tisme with ours. And as <HI>P. Martyr</HI> observeth upon the place, the Apostle doth not give instance in their circumcision, but in their Baptisme, that his paralell and comparison with our Baptisme might be the more evident. Now therefore if this paralell hold so fully, then adde two considerations more to make it yet more full; they are both of them against the Ana|baptists. First they were truly baptized with water, when but wet or besprinkled under the cloud, (and therefore the Apostle saith, they were <HI>baptized in the cloud</HI>) so are we and our children truly baptized with water, when sprinkled as well as dipped, which is not at all inconsistent, but most agreable to the signi|fication of the verbe <GAP DESC="foreign">. For althogh it signifieth <HI>immerge|re, tingere</HI> in which sense <HI>Iulius Pollux, lib:</HI> 1. <HI>cap,</HI> 9. reckoneth a|mong the passions of a ship, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>submergi</HI> to be drownd or run under water (and if any shall contend that the native signi|ficatio~ of <GAP DESC="foreign">, is <HI>mergo,</HI> or <HI>tingo,</HI> I neither think it can be con|vincingly proved, nor that it maketh against sprinkling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hough it were proved) this I hope cannot be denied that <GAP DESC="foreign">, doth also signifie <HI>abluo, lavo</HI> and so is used for any maner of washing by water, which whosoever will deny shall contradict <HI>Hesycli|us, Budaeus, Stephanus, Scapula, Arias Montanus, Pasor</HI> in their <HI>Lexicons,</HI> and the Holy Ghost himself, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 10. 2. 2 <HI>Heb:</HI> 9. 10 <HI>Luke</HI> 11. 38. with <HI>Mark.</HI> 7. 3, 4. Secondly I observe, that though the infants of the people of <HI>Israel</HI> were not fitt to eat of the Manna and drink of the water out of the Rock, as those of some age did, yet the youngest of their Infants were baptized and received a sacramentall seal of their interest in Christ and the covenant of Grace, which is a notable president to our
<PB N="215" REF="116">
Infant-baptisme, and it must needs hold, unlesse we weaken, yea subvert the Apostles argumentation in that place. For what more certain then that among so many hundreth thou|sand people, there were diverse Infants who had not yet the use of reason, nor were able to give an account of their Faith? What more uncontravertable then that these Infants were with the rest of the congregation baptized in the Sea and un|der the cloud, being externally incorporated in the Common|wealth of <HI>Israel,</HI> and the seed of <HI>Abraham?</HI> What more mani|fest then that the Apostle holds foorth to us that their baptis|me was materially or substantially the same with ours, both for the grace signified and sealed, and for the very element of water? So that this Infant-baptisme of theirs, is (upon the matter and according to the Apostles doctrine) a good war|rant for Infant-baptisme among us, as well as if the new Testa|ment had expresly told us that some Infants were baptized<NOTE PLACE="marg">Synops. purior.

This argument hath taken deep impression in my thoughts, and while I look after the suffrage of Divines, I finde some of very good note have had the same notion from this Text against the Anabaptists, shewing also that their objections against Infant-baptisme fall as heavy upon that baptisme of the children of <HI>Israel.</HI> My Reverent Brother M^r. <HI>Baillie,</HI> hath drawn an argument from the same Text for Infant-baptisme.

with water the Proselytes whom they received, is older then <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> which I finde supposed, yet not proved.

And so from M^r. <HI>Tombes</HI> his own supposition, he argueth for Infant-baptis|me, which he had reason to doe. Neverthelesse I have never yet read any proofor. Testimony brought to prove the Baptisme of Proselytes, which is not far short of <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> or Christs dayes. The Scripture mentions no signe or seal or ceremony of the initiation of Proselytes, but circumcision, after professi|on of their faith and desire to worship the true God and to be of his people. The baptizing of Proselytes was one of the Jew|ish traditions and inventions in their later and declining times. When it began I have not yet found, neither have I yet seen any proof which can make that custome older then <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> or as old as Christs baptisme. Next let it be proved to be as old as it can, yet the greatest searchers of the Jewish Antiquities have observed that the Baptisme of Proselytes was administred<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buzt. Lex. Chald.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of the use of a Table in the Lords Supper. And of the communi|cants their coming to, and receaving at the Table.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THat a Table ought to be so farre used, as that the Ele|ments of bread and wine ought to be set upon it, is not (I think) controverted; but whether therebe so much light from Scripture, as that all the com|municants ought to come to, and receave at the Table; This I conceave to be the question. For resolution whereof, I humbly offer these following considerations.</P>
<P>First of all it may easily appeare, that the first guests whom our Saviour intertained at this Sacrament of his body and bloud, receaved at the Table. <HI>Chrisostome de proditione Iudae,</HI> Serm. 30. Comparing the Eucharisticall supper with the passe|over, saith, that both of them was celebrated, <GAP DESC="foreign"> at or on the very same Table. The common Supper, the Pas|chall and the Eucharisticall were all at the Table, <HI>Luke</HI> 22. 21. <HI>But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with mee on the table.</HI> John 13. 28. <HI>Now no man at the Table knew, &amp;c.</HI> Which Texts I do not understand of the Lords Supper (as some do) but of the common Supper. But I suppose no man did ever imagine, that the Apostles being before set at the Table, did
<PB N="219" REF="118">
remove from it when they were to receave the Lords Table. Peradventure it will be replyed (for so it hath been replyed by some) that the first Communicants their sitting and receaving at the Table, was occasionall, in respect that they had been sit|ting before at the common and at the Paschal supper, so that in this particular, we are no more bound to follow Christs ex|ample, then in the other occasionall cicumstances, the upper chamber, unleavened bread, after supper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Beside, Christ had but twelve communicants, unto whom he was to give the Sacrament, and so might conveniently make them all sit at the table, which now in many Churches cannot conveniently be done. Finally, that it is as great a deviation from Christs ex|ample to have divers successive tables, without which innu|merous Congregations, all the communicants cannot receave at the table.</P>
<P>I answer. 1. 'Tis <HI>gratis dictum,</HI> that sitting at the Table was occasionall, or such as hath not a standing, but a temporary reason for it, and there is this reason to the contrary: occa|sionall circumstances in that action, which are not to be imi|tated by us, were such as Christ was limited unto by the law, or by the providence of God, so that therein he was not left at a liberty or latitude to choose to doe otherwise. For in|stance, it was not allowed by the Law to have any other bread in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> during the feast of passeover, but unleave|ned bread onely. The upper room was the place assigned by the Master of the house, God so ordering. After supper it must be, because it must succeed to the passeover, being also the Testament, or latter will of Jesus Christ. There was also a providentiall limitation, to such and so many communicants, that is, not exceeding the number which was allowed to eat the passeover together. Let some such reason be brought to prove that sitting at table, was occasionall, else let it not be cal|led so. Sure if Christ had not thought it fittest, and choosed
<PB N="220" REF="119">
it as the best way, that his Disciples should receave his last Supper at the table, it was free to him to have changed their posture without encroachment upon any law of <HI>Moses,</HI> or upon any providentiall limitation. Secondly, I am herein the more confirmed, because Christ himself, as it were on purpose to shew, that the sitting and receaving at Table was not occasionall, but such a thing as he meant to commend un|to us for our imitation, he gives this standing and permanent reason for it, that it is a peice of honour that he will have put upon those whom he inviteth, calleth, and alloweth to eat and drink with him, <HI>Luke</HI> 22. 27. for whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meat?</P>
<P>This <HI>at meat</HI> is not in the Originall, where wee finde onely <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>he that sitteth,</HI> wee may aswell and better supply <HI>at table,</HI> from <HI>vers:</HI> 21. adde <HI>vers:</HI> 30. That yee may (here I supply from <HI>vers:</HI> 27. and <HI>Matth.</HI> 8. 11. <HI>Sit downe and) eat and drinke at my table in my Kingdome, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Israel.</HI> Here is an honour of <HI>Communion,</HI> and an honour of <HI>Iurisdiction:</HI> The honour of <HI>Communion,</HI> is to eat and drink at his Table in his Kingdome, and this ho|nour (signified by their sitting, eating and drinking at his table in his last Supper) he puts upon them as beleeving communi|cants, so that it belongs to all such. There is another ho|nour joyned with a speciall judiciall prerogative, to sit on Thrones, and judge the twelve Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> and herein there is somewhat meant peculiarly of the Apostles, which is notwithstanding mentioned else were in a different phrase, as a Prerogative of all the Saints, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 6. 2. Thirdly, it cannot be denyed, but that the first communicants who receaved from Christ, might with more ease and conveniency be placed at the table, then can bee now in many Churches, which have been accustomed to another way. But we must not bring down
<PB N="221" REF="119">
our rule to our conveniences, rather bring up our convenien|cies to our rule. It is no hard matter to alter pewes and such like things in Churches, where the present posture is incon|sistent with following the patterne: and a lesse alteration will serve then is apprehended. Fourthly, the flux and reflux (so to speak) of severall successive tables, where there is a great number to communicat, and the repeating, or pronouncing, and applying to those severall tables of receavers, the words, <HI>Take ye, eat ye,</HI> which Christ pronounced but once in one act of distribution, these things (I say) cannot be justly charged as deviations from the example of Christ, when the same pro|vidence which limited him to a fewer number, calls us to di|stribute to a great number: Neither can they who so charge us, ever make good what they alledge, unlesse they prove that although Christ had been distributing this Sacrament to all the 500. Disciples, to whom hee appeared after his resur|rection (suppose I say, there had been so many communicants) yet he had given them all at once the elements, and had said but once, <HI>Take ye, eat yee,</HI> and that there had been no intermis|sion at all, nor no partition into severall successive Companies. If this can be proved, then they say much against the use of successive Tables, otherwise not. Fifthly, our dissenting brethren of the <HI>Independent</HI> way, who dislike our severall and successive tables in one Congregation, as a dividing of those who ought to communicat all together, (for they would have none of the Communicants receave the cup, before all of the Congregation who communicat, have receaved the bread) these brethren, I say, may satisfie themselves from their owne principles; For they hold, that although a Congregation en|crease so much, as that they cannot, or be so persecuted, that they may not meet safely in one place, for the Word and Sa|craments, and supposing the Church of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> before the dispersion, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 1. to have been so numerous, and to have
<PB N="222" REF="120">
accressed to so many thousands, as could not receave the Sa|crament of the Lords Supper, nor ordinarily assemble into one place for the Worship of God, (that they receaved the Lords Supper in severall companies, and severall houses, is ordinarily collected from <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 46. <HI>and breaking bread from house to house,</HI> which the <HI>Syriak</HI> expoundeth expressely of the <HI>Eucharist.</HI>) Yet all this (say they) breaks not the Church, but they are still one particular Church. Now if severall companies of the same Church assembled, and receaving the Lords Supper in severall places, be not a breaking or dividing of the Congregation, nor a deviation from the example of Christ, much lesse can they with any reason, charge our com|municating by severall companies at successive tables, in the same meeting place or Assembly, to be a breaking of the Con|gregation, or a deviation from Christs example. If one of their Congregations may receave the Sacrament in severall houses, when (by reason of numerousnesse) they cannot all receave it together in one house, I cannot conceive why they may not much more allow us severall successive tables in the Assembly, when the whole cannot communicat at one table, so much for my first argument taken from Christs example.</P>
<P>The second Argument, I shall take from the generall noti|on and nature of the Lords Supper, as it is <HI>epulum,</HI> a banquet or feast. As those things which are competent to every hu|mane society, or lawfull Assembly, are also competent to the Church and people of God; And that which every speaker which speaks in any publik audience ought to doe, the same ought a preacher who speaks to the Church, doe (for instance the posture of his body, and the extension of his voice, ought to be such as he may be best seen and heard) so likewise those things that are competent, and convenient to every feast or banquet, ought not to be wanting in the Lords Supper, which is the marriage feast of the Kings sonne, <HI>Matth:</HI> 22. 2, 3. a
<PB N="223" REF="120">
great Supper, <HI>Luke</HI> 14. 16. the Feast, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 8. <HI>Prov.</HI> 9. 2. <HI>Cant:</HI> 5. 1. whatsoever is more meant in these Texts, sure the Lords Supper is one thing, and a principall thing which is in|tended. The Lords Supper is not onely a feast, but a type, and representation of the Everlasting feast and communion with Christ in glory, <HI>Luke</HI> 14. 15. <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. 9. 'Tis true the marrow and fatnesse, the substance and sweetnesse of this feast in the Lords-Supper, lies in the spirituall and invisible part, yet (as <HI>Irenaeus</HI> said) a Sacrament consists of two parts, one earthly and visible, another heavenly and invisible, so that in the very externall part, although there is that which may dif|ference it from a carnall feast, yet there is that which hath a resemblance of a feast, <HI>viz.</HI> the eating and drinking of many together in a publick place, a table covered, comely vessels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Otherwise if in the externall dispensation, there were no resemblance of a feast, then we should take away the Analogy betwixt the signe and the thing signified. Now among other things which are suteable to every feast or banquet, even <HI>ex more recepto apud omnes gentes,</HI> one is, that the guests come to, and sit at the Table; which by the very light of nature, and generall consent of the Nations, is a token of respect, dignity, and honour put upon the guests. As likewise of friendship and commaradship, or <HI>sodalitium.</HI> Thence the Greek proverbe <GAP DESC="foreign">, not to violat the salt and table. <HI>i.e.</HI> friendship, whereof eating at one table was a symbole. Thence also that <HI>Plautin</HI> phrase, <HI>communicabo te semper mensa mea.</HI> It is aggravation of falshood, and treachery <HI>they shall speak lies at one Table,</HI> that is, under a profession and signe of friendship, <HI>Dan.</HI> 11. 27. When <HI>David</HI> said to <HI>Mephibosheth, thou shalt eat bread at my table continually,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam:</HI> 9. 7. doe wee think that <HI>David</HI> meant no more, but that <HI>Mephibosheth</HI> should eat of the Kings meat, and be maintained by his favour? Nay <HI>Me|phibosheths</HI> servant had so much. But there is an <HI>Emphasis</HI> put
<PB N="224" REF="121">
upon eating at the Kings table, more then upon eating of the Kings meat: So the King expoundeth himselfe, <HI>vers:</HI> 11. As for <HI>Mephibosheth</HI> said the King, he shall eat at my Table, as one of the Kings Sonnes, so also doth <HI>Me|phibosheth</HI> interpret it, 2 <HI>Sam,</HI> 19. 28. Another example (though perhaps it rise not so high) see 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 2. 7. <HI>But shew kindnesse to the sons of</HI> Barzillai <HI>the</HI> Gileadite, <HI>and let them be of those that eat at thy Table.</HI> It was an argument of <HI>Iezebels</HI> favour to the Pro|phets of the groves, that they did eat at her Table, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 18. 19. So did <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> expresse his friendship, to the 150 Jewes and Rulers who did eat at his Table, <HI>Neh.</HI> 5. 17. Peradventure in the two last examples, there were some successive (at least severall Tables:) However, eating at any mans Table was ever a Symbole of friendship with him. Wherefore looking upon the Lords Supper as a feast or a great Supper made by the great King, it ought not to be without this friendly respect, dignati|on, and honour, which hath been universally among the Nati|ons signified and expressed by placeing the guests at the Table. And I can esteem it no lesse then an erring <HI>toto genere,</HI> when the order and decency, which is universally observed in all o|ther feasts, (as such, that is, not as lavish, excessive, disorderly, but as feasts) is not observed in the Church-feast, the Lords Supper. When the old Prophet did invite the young Prophet to eat bread, and drink water with him, common civility made a table necessary in this single intertainment. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 13. 20. <HI>And it came to passe as they sat at the Table, &amp;c.</HI> If it were a disre|spect to invite friends to eat &amp; drink with us, &amp; yet when they come, not to place them at a Table (where a Table may be had) I know no reason why it ought not also to be conceived a wrong|ing of Christs guests, when they are not placed at his Table.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I argue from the name <HI>Table,</HI> which the Apostle makes use of in this Ordinance. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 21. <HI>ye cannot be par|takers of the Lords Table, and of the Table of devills.</HI> The table of
<PB N="225" REF="121">
Divells was that which they did sit at, and eat at, in the Idols temple, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8 10. The Lords Table was that which they did sit at, and eat at in the Church, and in those times (to note that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide. H. Grotii an|not. in Matth. 26. 25.</NOTE> by the way) they did eat their love feasts before the Lords Supper in imitation of Christ, who had the Sacrament after Supper, which doth to me put it the more out of doubt, that those primitive Christians received the Lords Supper at the Table. The name <HI>table</HI> is also used (not without respect to the Lords Supper) <HI>Prov.</HI> 9. 2. <HI>Wisedome hath killed her beasts</HI> (or according to the Hebrew, <HI>her killing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> She hath mingled her wine, she hath also furnished her Table,</HI> where there is another distinct Emphasis upon the furnishing of her Table, beside the prepa|ring of meat and drink. Again <HI>Cant:</HI> 1. 12. while the King sit|teth at his Table, my Spiknard sendeth foorth the smell there|of. It appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> by this smell that she was also at Table with the King: for the words intimat that, when the Church is nearest to Christ, even sitting at Table with him, then her graces send foorth the most pleasant smell, and then doth Christ sup with the Church upon her graces, als well as she with him upon his mercies and comforts, so that here is a mutuall intertainment and communion In that Evangelicall vision of <HI>Ezekiel</HI> concern|ing the second house, which is the Church of Christ, there is also mention of a Table and of comming to it, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44. 16. <HI>&amp; they shall come near to my Table.</HI> It hath been alledged by some, that the name <HI>table</HI> is but figurative when the Scriprure useth it in reference to the Sacrament, &amp; that to partake of the Lords table is no more but to partake of the body and blood of the Lord. So <HI>Psalme</HI> 78. 19. <HI>Can GOD furnish a Table in the wil|dernesse i. e.</HI> give us flesh. To this I answere, when the Name <HI>Table</HI> is used for meat and drink, this very use of the word doth not exclude but plainly suppose a materiall Table, at which men use to eat and drink, and so a <HI>Table</HI> is us|ed <HI>promens&acirc; dapibus instruct&acirc;,</HI> so <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>secundae mensae:</HI>
<PB N="226" REF="122">
<HI>Auferre mens as,</HI> or the like, though not meant of the wooden table, yet do suppose the wooden Table. I do not doubt, but they in the wildernesse lusted after a perfect furnisht Table, and not meerly after flesh, though that was the cheife thing they desired&punc; and I make als little question, but there were both Tables and beds in the wildernesse, such as might be had, and such as Armies use when they encampe and pitch their Tents. But I ask, ought there to be a materiall Table in the Lords Supper, or ought there not, or is it indifferent? I never yet read it, or heard it doubted by any, but there ought to be a materiall Table. All that have been zealous for throwing down Altars, would yet have a Table. If so, by vertue of what warrant ought there to be a Table, and for what use? First by vertue of what warrant? Is it by vertue of Christs ex|ample, or any other Scripturall warrant; or is it because of a naturall conveniency and decency? If by a Scripturall war|rant, I have what I desire. The same Scripturall warrant which will prove that there ought to be a Table, will also prove that the Communicants ought to come to it, and communicat to|gether at it. For the Scripture alloweth not a greater honour to be put upon some Communicants, that they eat of the Kings meat, and at the Kings Table too, and a lesser honour to be put upon other communicants, that they eat of the Kings meat, but not at the Kings Table. If it be said, that a materiall Table hath not its rise from any scripturall warrant, but from naturall conveniency or decency, then it shall be no trespasse against the word of God, to have no materiall Table at all, o|therwise then as a naturall indecency. And beside, I still urge the same argument which I was even now hinting, be it by vertue of a scripturall warrant, or be it by vertue of a naturall conveniency, the argument is the same, how ever&punc; all the communicants should come to it, or none at all, for if some come to the Table, and some come not, this is
<PB N="227" REF="122">
not agreeable to that <GAP DESC="foreign">, or equall honour and dignation, which all the communicants ought to have. Naturall decency a's well as Scripturall warrants are of equall concernment to all the communicants. The second <HI>Quaere</HI> was, for what end and use ought there to be a materiall table? Is it meerly to be a cupboard for holding the vessels and cups which containe the Elements, and that the Minister may cary them from the Ta|ble to those who are to receive? Then it is no Table, for <GAP DESC="foreign"> is a Table which we dine or sup at, no by-boord for holding things which servants are to present unto those who sit at the Table. What then? Is the Table of the Lord in the new Testa|ment intended for the same end and use as the Table of the Lord in the old Testament, <HI>Mal:</HI> 1. 7. <HI>The table of the Lord is centemptible?</HI> If so, then we make the Table an Altar, and the Sacrament a sacrifice. For the Sacrifice was Gods meat eaten up by fire from Heaven, and the Altar Gods Table, because it contained his meat. But now the Table of the Lord must have another sense in the new Testament; the Lords Supper being no sacrifice, but <HI>epulum ex oblatis,</HI> a feast upon the body and blood of Christ offered upon the crosse for us. Of this nature of the Lords Supper, M^r <HI>Cudworth</HI> hath learnedly discoursed in a Treatise printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1642. I conclude the Table which we speak of, is not for a sacrifice, but for a Sacrament, for a feast, for meat which God offers to us not wee to him. There|fore we ought to come unto the Table of the Lord to receive the mysticall food in the Sacrament, als well as we come to our ordinary Table for our ordinary food. Otherwise what ever use we may devise for a Table in the Sacrament, sure it serves not for the use of a table, at least not to all the Communicants.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I offer also this argument. The comming to and receiving at the Table serveth to set foorth the communion of Saints with Christ and among themselves, which is a princi|pall thing intended in this Sacrament, and without such a sym|bole
<PB N="228" REF="123">
as I now plead for, is not plainly and clearly set foorth in this Ordinance. To eat in the same house, and of the same meat, is nothing near such a signe of fellowship or communion, as to eat at the same Table. This difference is noted between <HI>Martha</HI> and <HI>Lazarus, Ioh.</HI> 12. 2. when they made a supper to Jesus in <HI>Bethany,</HI> Martha <HI>served, but</HI> Lazarus <HI>was one of them who sate at the Table with him. Lazarus</HI> therefore had more fel|lowship with Christ at that time. <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> on 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 10. noteth out of <HI>Chrysostome</HI> that <HI>communicare</HI> doth imply <HI>sodali|tium,</HI> and is more then <HI>participare,</HI> to communicat is more then to partake, for one may partake of the same bread, who doth not communicat in the same bread. Hee ha eateth of the same thing, but not at the same Table, cannot be altogether or pro|perly called <GAP DESC="foreign">, or, <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>you shame them that have not,</HI> (<HI>or them that are poore</HI>) saith the Apostle. <HI>What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11: 22. So say I those that receive the Sacrament in their Pewes, shame the poor that have no Pewes, wherein they are not to be praised. Sure it were more co~munion like to sit &amp; receive at one Table. It is the most suteable &amp; significant setting foorth of the com|munion of Saints, when the children of God are like <HI>Olive plants round about his Table, Psal:</HI> 128. 3. Therefore the Apostle having mentioned our partaking of one bread, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 17. addeth verse 21. our partaking of one Table, which is the Lords Table. When Communicants come not to the Table, but abide in their Pewes, some here, some there, this is indeed a dividing of the congregation <HI>in varias partes partiumque par|ticulas:</HI> Neither can they be said to divide the cup amongst themselves, (which by the institution they ought to doe in te|stimony of their communion) when they are not within reach, yea oftentimes not within sight of one another. There is no|thing like a dividing it amongst themselves, where they come not to the Table, and there give the cup each to other. I know
<PB N="229" REF="123">
some have scrupled whether our Saviours words, <HI>Luke</HI> 22. 17. <HI>Take this and divide it amongst your selves;</HI> be meant of the Eu|charisticall cup, or of the Paschall. But they goe upon surer rea|sons who put it out of question, that it is meant of the Eucha|risticall cup (which is there mentioned by <HI>Luke</HI> by way of An|ticipation, I shall for the present give but this reason, which I know hath satisfied some who were of another opinion (al|though much more might be said) that which <HI>Luke</HI> recordeth to have been spoken by Christ concerning that cup, which he bade them divide amongst themselves, the very same doe <HI>Mat|thew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> record to have been spoken by him, concern|ing the Eucharisticall cup, which was drunk last of all, and af|ter the Paschall supper, <HI>viz.</HI> That thencefoorth he would not drink of the fruit of the Vine untill he should drink it in the Kingdome of God, which doth not hold true if understood of the Paschall cup, therefore those other Evangelists plainly ap|ply it to the Eucharisticall cup, and there withall they close the historie of the Sacrament, adding only that a hymne was sung, <HI>Math:</HI> 26. 27, 28, 29. <HI>Mark,</HI> 14. 23, 24, 25. with <HI>Luke</HI> 22. 17, 18. And if notwithstanding some will not be perswaded that the words, <HI>divide it amongst your selves,</HI> were meant of the Eucharisticall cup, as I am confident they are in a mistake, so I hope they will at last yeeld this argument, <HI>a fortiori.</HI> If there was such a symbole of communion in the Pascall cup, that the receivers were to divide it amongst themselves, sure this ought to have place much more in the Eucharisticall cup, for the Lords supper doth more clearly and fully set forth the com|munion of Saints, then the Passeover did.</P>
<P>The fifth Argument I shall draw from the words which Christ used in the distribution, <HI>Take ye, eat ye, this is my body which is broken for you,</HI> and of the cup, <HI>Drink ye all of it.</HI> The insti|tution is our rule and patterne, and tis high presumption for any man to be wiser than the Sonne of God, or to speak to the
<PB N="132" REF="124">
communicants individually in the distribution, <HI>Take thou, eat thou, This is the Lords body broken for thee,</HI> &amp;c. When Christ thought fit in the distribution to speak in the plurall, <HI>Take yee, eat ye,</HI> &amp;c. 'Tis no answer to say, that the words, <HI>Take ye, eat yee,</HI> &amp;c. are used in the consecration, for then they are but related Historically. Here is the strength of the Argument, Christ spoke so in the act of distribution, and by way of ap|plication to the Communicants in a demonstrative enunciati|on, therefore so should we. But now this cannot be, where the communicants do not receave at the Table, but in their se|verall Pewes: This very thing hath occasioned the change of the words of the institution, from the plurall to the singular.</P>
<P>Sixthly, we have some light from antiquity also in this particular, for which purpose there are some notable passa|ges in <HI>Chrysostome, tom:</HI> 5. <HI>de Divers. Nov. Test. locis. Ser:</HI> 21. where opening these abuses in the matter of love-feasts, repro|ved in the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> who joyned together with these the Sacrament, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. this he much insists upon as a princi|pall abuse, that they did eat <GAP DESC="foreign"> by themselves, or seve|rally: and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the table is not made Common,</HI> for the rich did eat by themselves, not together with the poore. Christ did not so with his Disciples in his last Supper, <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>For in that Sup|per, both the Master and all the servants sate together. Chryso|stome</HI> sheweth further from the Churches custome and forme observed in the administration of the Lords Supper, how justly the Apostle challengeth that abuse in the love feasts. For in the Lords-Supper all approach unto, and receave at the same table <HI>For,</HI> saith he, <HI>that spirituall and holy Table is com|mon to all, both rich and poore</HI>&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>there is the same honour, the same accesse and approach for all.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">
<PB N="231" REF="124">
<GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>And untill all doe partake of this spirituall and holy Table, the things which are set upon the Table, are not taken a|way, but all the Priests,</HI> (or Ministers) <HI>stand expecting even him who is the poorest, or smallest of all.</HI> So that according to this form and custome which he holdeth forth unto us, the Ministers did not goe about with the Elements unto the severall pewes of the Communicants, but they stood still at the table, and all the Communicants, both poore and rich come to the Table.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> That there was among the Jewes a jurisdiction and government Ec|clesiasticall, distinct from the civill.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_FIrst, they had Elders who were Spirituall or Ecclesi|asticall (not civill) rulers. Whence it is that <HI>Salma|sius de primatu papae, pag:</HI> 3. and long before <HI>Am|brose</HI> in 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 5. doeth paralell the Jewish Elders not to the Christian Magistrate, but to the Elders of the Chri|stian Church ordained by the Apostles. I do not say that they had no Elders who were civill Magistrates; but they had some Elders who were Church Governours, or had an Ecclesiasti|cal jurisdiction. Which I prove 1. By the arguments brought before, <HI>Book</HI> 1 <HI>chap:</HI> 3. <HI>pag:</HI> 26. 27.</P>
<P>2. The Jewes when they had lost their State, power, and civill Government, had still under the Romane Emperours their <HI>Presbyteri</HI> and <HI>Archisynagogi.</HI> Whereof M^r. <HI>Selden</HI> in <HI>Eutych: pag:</HI> 15. 16. brings cleare instances under <HI>Arcadius</HI> and <HI>Honorius.</HI> Now the Romane Emperours did not permit to the Jewes their owne civill Government, but onely an <HI>Auto|nomy</HI> in Religion. So <HI>ibid: pag:</HI> 34. he sheweth us that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have permitted to the Jewes in <HI>England</HI> their <HI>Presbyteratus,</HI> which he doth not deny, but halfe yeeld, to have been the same with their <HI>Sacerdotium.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="125">3. Although M^r. <HI>Selden, comment:</HI> in <HI>Eutych: Orig: pag.</HI> 17. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to 34. and in his <HI>Vxor Ebraica. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>chap.</HI> 15. holdeth that the Jewish Elders or Presbyters, were such as were crea|ted by impositione of hands, receaving thereby a judiciall fa|cultie or degree, so that thence forth they were capable of membership in the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> either of 23. or 71. and were fit to preside in judging of civill causes: and so endeavoureth to shew that it was a civill, not a sacred or Ecclesiasticall dig|nity and preferment; Yet he furnisheth me with some consi|derable arguments to confirme my opinion, beside that which was last mentioned. As 1. He tells us in <HI>Eutych. pag.</HI> 16. that <HI>nomina officiorum Sacrorum, ut patriarcha, Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">byter, Aposto|lus, Diaconus, Primas Et Episcopus, in Christianismum ex Iuda|ismi veteris usu,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>manarunt.</HI> But if the Jewish Elders were not promoted to a sacred, but to a civill jurisdiction, that name should have been transferred to Magistrates, Judges, Parlia|ment men, rather then to Church officers. 2. He tells of a divi|ded, distinct, bounded &amp; particular Ordniation of the Iewish Elders, some of them being ordained to a faculty or power of judging, but not to judge of lawfull or unlawfull rites, others of them being ordained to judge of rites, but not of pecuniary causes. The forme of words which he citeth, is this, <HI>Et sit tibi sacultas judicandi, sed ita ut minime sit tibi facultas decernen|di quinam ritus illiciti, quinam liciti, aut sit tibi hujusmodi facul|tas decernendi, ita tamen ut causas pecuniarias non sit tibi facultas judicandi.</HI> Behold a sacred and a civill jurisdiction distingui|shed. M^r. <HI>Selden</HI> himself, <HI>uxor. Ebr. lib.</HI> 1 <HI>cap.</HI> 15. tells us that the word Presbyters or Elders, is by the <HI>Talmudicall</HI> wri|ters used no only for those who were created by imposition of hands to a Magistraticall or judiciall facultie, such as the mem|bers of the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> or such as were candidats in that facul|tie, and as it were expectants of a place, and memberships in their Courts of justice, but also for other fit and idoneous per|sons,
<PB N="233" REF="125">
who might be called for counsell or advice. Therefore all their Elders were not civill Magistrates.</P>
<P>My second Argument shall be taken from the Jewish Ordi|nation of Elders, (Ordination being an act of the power of jurisdiction, not of order) with imposition of hands, from which Mr. <HI>Selden, Eutych. pag.</HI> 24. 25. tells us, the Christian Ordination and imposition of hands upon Presbyters, was bo rowed (even as the Christian baptisme from the Jewish baptisme at the admission of Proselytes, and the Lords Supper from what was used in the passeover,) whereunto hee saith, any man will assent, if he consider what is found in the <HI>Talmu|dicall</HI> writers of the number of <HI>three,</HI> (which was the least number which could suffice to the ordaining of a Jewish Elder; and the same was the least number which the ancient Church thought sufficient for Ordination:) Also of the internall effect of that Jewish Ordination, with laying on of hands, which effect was the resting of the holy Ghost upon the Elder so or|dained. And this was drawen from <HI>Num.</HI> 11. 26. <HI>Deut.</HI> 34. 9. See <HI>ibid.</HI> 21. 22. There is so much of the Christian Ordi|nation borrowed from the Jewish, that D. <HI>Buxtorf: lex: Rab|bin. pag:</HI> 1499. where he speaks of the Jewish Ordination, re|ferrests to 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 14. I will adde other three cited by M^r. <HI>Selden, ibid: pag:</HI> 22. First, <HI>I. Scaliger, Elench&punc; Triher: cap:</HI> 20. When I turne to this place, I finde <HI>Scaliger</HI> moves the question, how it came to passe that Christ was permitted to sit, and to teach among the Doctors in the Temple, not being ordained. (Marke here an Ordination which was for publick teaching, not for a power of civill judicature, which Christ never assu|med) and how it came that both hee and <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> were called <HI>Rabbi:</HI> also he paralells one newly ordained among the Jewes, with a young Bishop in the ancient Canons. The next shall be, <HI>H. Grotius annot.</HI> in <HI>Evan. pag:</HI> 329. When I turne hither, I finde <HI>Grotius</HI> speaking thus, <HI>Manuum impositio</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="126">
<HI>apud Iudaeos indicabat invocationem divinae potentiae: ut alibi dixi|mus. unde factum est ut munia publica eo ritu conferentur, etiam civilia ut Senatorum.

Lastly I turne to <HI>Itiner Beni. pag:</HI> 73. 74. Where I read of one <HI>D. Daniel Filius Husday,</HI> called <HI>caput exulum,</HI> unto whom the dispersed Jewes in severall Provinces, have their recourse for Ordinati|on of their Preachers or Teachers. <HI>Hi omnes Israelitarum caetus ab exulum capite potestatem accipiunt, sibi in singulis Congregatio|nibus professorem &amp; concionatorem praeficiendi.

A Doctor or Professor in the Schoole, and a Preacher in the Synagogue, are here joyned as the common and ordinary rulers in the par|ticular Assemblies of the Jews, as <HI>L' Empereur</HI> noteth, <HI>not.</HI> in <HI>Benjam:</HI> 148. 149. where he also cleareth, that this <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Cha|zan</HI> mentioned there by <HI>Benjamin</HI> was not a civill ruler, but <HI>praelector &amp; concionator,</HI> a reader &amp; expounder of Scripture. See <HI>Buxtorf: lex: Rabbin.</HI> at the same word. <HI>Hic maxime oratione sive precibus &amp; cantu Ecclesiae praeibat, praeerat lectioni legali, docens quod &amp; quomodo legendum, &amp; similibus quae ad sacra pertinebant.</HI> And after he sayeth of this word, <HI>pro Ministro Sacrorum passim usitatissimum.</HI> tis a rabbinicall word, sounding somewhat near <HI>chozim, seers,</HI> which was a name given to the Prophets, from <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>vidit.</HI> Moreover observe this passage of <HI>Elias</HI> in <HI>Tisbite,</HI> at the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Cuicunque manus imposita est ad Magisterium, sed non dum idoneus est ut doceat dogma, quo vocetur doctor noster Magister, eum Magistri socium seu familiarem dicunt.</HI> This is cited by <HI>Scaliger, Elench Triher. cap:</HI> 20. and by <HI>L' Empereur not.</HI> in <HI>Benjam: pag:</HI> 188.

<PB N="235" REF="126">
Masters, yet are diverse times promoted to the degree of Bat|chellours; yea, Doctors of Divinity. So then hands were laid on such a person as intended to be a Teacher, and if hee had not yet a dogmaticall facultie for Teaching, he was coun|ted but a fellow.</P>
<P>A third argument I take from the <HI>Synagoga magni,</HI> see <HI>Aa|rons</HI> Rod, <HI>pag.</HI> 4. 5. 137. 146. Adde M^r. <HI>Selden</HI> in <HI>Eutych&punc; pag:</HI> 42. where he tells us out of the <HI>Ierusalem Gemara, Centum &amp; viginti Presbyteri, &egrave; quibus octoginta prophetae fuere aut instar Prophetarum, hanc precandi formulam institueruut.</HI> Marke they were Elders, and that an Assembly was an Eldership or San|hedrim. But is it credible that <HI>Ezra Zerubbabell, Haggai, Ze|chariah</HI> and <HI>Malachia</HI> would consent that such an Assembly, for which there been neither institution nor president before, should assume that great power in Church affaires? <HI>Salom.

<P>This also I must in the second place premise, that the mean|ing
<PB N="239" REF="128">
of the assertion is not that humane reason drawing a con|sequence from Scripture can be the ground of our belief or conscience. For although the consequence or argumentati|on be drawn foorth by mens reasons, yet the consequent it self or conclusion is not believed nor embraced by the strength of reason, but because it is the truth and will of God, which <HI>Camero prael: tom:</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 364. doth very well clear.</P>
<P><HI>Ante omnia hoc tenendum est, aliud esse consequentiae rationem de|prehendere, aliud ipsum consequens; nam ut monuimus supra saepe|numero deprehenditur consequentiae ratio, cum nec comprehendatur antecedens nec deprehendatur consequens, tantum intelligitur hoc ex illo sequi.

<P>Thirdly let us here observe with <HI>Gerhard,</HI> a distinction be|between<NOTE PLACE="marg">Loc.

Tis the latter not the former reason which will be convinced &amp; satisfied with con|sequences and conclusions drawn from Scripture, in things which concerne the glory of God, and matters spirituall or divine.</P>
<P>Fourthly, there are two sorts of consequences which <HI>Aqu&igrave;|nas prima part: quaest.</HI> 32. <HI>art.</HI> 1. <HI>2um.</HI> distinguisheth. 1. Such as
<PB N="240" REF="129">
make a sufficient and strong poof, or where the consequence is necessary and certaine, as for instance sayeth he, when reason is brought in naturall science to prove that the motion of the Heaven is ever of uniforme swiftnesse, not at one time slow|er and another time swifter. 2. By way of agreablenesse or con|veniency&punc; as in Astrology (saith hee) thi reason is brought for the Excentricks or Epicycles, because by these being sup|posed) the <HI>Phoenomena,</HI> or <HI>appa entia sensibila</HI> in the Coelestiall motions may be salved Which he thinks is no necessary proof, because their <HI>Phoenomena</HI> may be salved another way, and by making another supposition. Now the consequences from Scripture are likewise of two sorts, some necessary, strong, and certain, and of these I here speak in this assertion; others which are good consequences to prove a sutablenesse or agreablenes of this or that to Scripture, though another thing may be also proved to be agreable unto the same Scripture in the same or another place. This latter sort are in diverse things of very use. But for the present I speak of necessary consequences. I have now explained the assertion, I will next prove it by these arguments. First, from the example of Christ and his Apo|stles, Christ proved against the <HI>Sadduces</HI> the Resurrection of the dead, from the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> which was the only Scripture ac|knowledged by them, as many think, though some others hold there is no warrant for thinking so, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22 31, 3. <HI>Luke</HI> 20. 37, 38. <HI>Now that the dead are raised, even</HI> Moses <HI>shewed at the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of</HI> Abraham, <HI>and the God of</HI> Isaac, <HI>and the God of</HI> Jacob, <HI>for he is not a God of the dead but of the living: for all live unto him.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 10. 34, 35, 36. Is it not written in your Law, I said ye are Gods. If hee called them gods unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; Say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent unto the world, thou plasphemest, because I said, I am the Sonne of God?</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="129">The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> proved by consequence from Scripture Christs Resurrection, <HI>Act:</HI> 13. 33, 34. <HI>He hath raised up Iesus again, as it is also written in the second Psalme, thou art my Sonne this day have I begotten thee. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to returne to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.</HI> His God head is proved, <HI>Heb:</HI> 1. 6. From these words, <HI>Let all the Angels of God worship him.</HI> Divine worship cannot be due, and may not be given to any that is not God.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Argum:</HI> Although <HI>Hooker</HI> in his Ecclesiasticall policy, and other Prelaticall writers did hold this difference be|tween the old and new Testament, that Christ and his Apostles hath not descended into all particularities with us as <HI>Moses</HI> did with the Jews, yet upon examination it will be found that all the ordinances and holy things of the Christian Church are no lesse determined and contained in the new Testament, then the Ordinances in the Jewish Church were determined in the old, and that there were some necessary things left to be collected by necessary consequences, from the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> as well as now from the new Testament, If we consult the <HI>Tal|mud,</HI> we find there that the Law, <HI>Num:</HI> 15. 31. concerning the soul to be cut off, for despysing the word of the Lord is appli|ed to those who denied necessary consequences from the Law, and (saith the <HI>Talmud</HI>) if a man would acknowledge the whole Law to be from Heaven, <HI>praeter istam collectionem amajori aut mi|nori, istamve, &agrave; pari, is notatur ill&acirc; sententi&acirc; quia verbum Domini aspernatus est, Exc.</HI> Gem ar. Senhedrin. cap: 11. sect. 38. So that here are two sorts of necessary consequences from the Law, one is <HI>a majori aut minori</HI> or if ye will, <HI>a fortiori:</HI> another <HI>a pari</HI> either of which being refused, the Law it self was despi|sed, yea tis further to be observed with M^r. <HI>Selden</HI> in his <HI>Vxor Haebraica lib:</HI> 1. <HI>cap:</HI> 3. that the <HI>Karaei</HI> or <HI>Iudaei scripturarii</HI> who reject the additaments or traditions of the <HI>Talmudicall</HI> Ma|sters,
<PB N="242" REF="130">
and professe to adhere to the literall and simple sense of the Law, without adding to it, or diminishing from it, yet even they themselves do not require expresse words of Scripture for every Divine Institution; but what they hold to be commanded or forbidden by the law of God, such commandment or prohi|bition they draw from the Law three wayes, either from the very words of the Scripture it self, or by argumentation from Scripture, or by the hereditary transmission of interpretations, which interpretations of Scripture formerly received, the fol|lowing Generations were allowed after to correct and alter upon further discovery or better reason. The second way which was by argumentation, was by the principles of the <HI>Ka|raei</HI> themselves of two sorts, <HI>a pari</HI> or <HI>a fortiori.</HI> Which agreeth with the passage of the <HI>Talmud</HI> before cited. And herein our writers agree with the <HI>Karaei,</HI> that all kinds of unlawfull and forbidden mariages are not expresly mentioned in the law, but diverse of them to be collected by consequence, that is, either by parity of reason, or by greater strength of reason: for instance, <HI>Levit&punc;</HI> 18. 10. <HI>The nakednesse of thy Sons daughter, or of thy daughters daughter, even their nakednesse thou shalt not uncover: For theirs is thine own nakednesse.</HI> Hence the conse|quence is drawn <HI>a pari.</HI> Therefore a man may not uncover the nakednesse of his great grand-child, or of her who is the daughter of his Sonnes daughter. For that also is his own nakednesse, being a discent <HI>in linea recta</HI> from himself. From the same Text, 'tis collected <HI>&agrave; fortiori,</HI> that much lesse a man may uncover the nakednesse of his own daughter, which yet is not expressely forbiden in the Law, but left to be thus col|lected by necessary consequence from the very same Text, 'tis likewise a necessary consequence that a man may not unco|ver the nakednesse of her who is daughter to his wives sonne, or to his wives daughter. For here the reason holds, 'tis his owne nakednesse, his wife and he being one flesh, which gives
<PB N="243" REF="130">
ground to that generall receaved rule, that a man may not marry any of his wives blood, nearer than he may of his own, neither may a wife marry any of her husbands blood, nearer then she may of her owne. Again, <HI>Levit:</HI> 18. 14. <HI>Thou shalt not uncover the nakednesse of thy fathers brother,</HI> &amp;c. Hence it followeth <HI>&agrave; pari,</HI> that a man may not uncover the nakednesse of his mothers brother, and by parity of reason (ever since that law was made,) 'tis also unlawfull for a woman to mar|ry him who hath been husband to her father sister, or to her mothers sister, the nearnesse of blood being alike between Uncle and Neece, as between Ant and Nephew. Other in|stances may be given, but these may suffice to prove that what doeth by necessary consequence follow from the law, must be understood to be commanded, or forbidden by God, as well as that which is expressely commanded or forbidden in the Text of Scripture.</P>
<P>3. Argument, If we say that necessary consequences from Scripture prove not a <HI>jus divinum,</HI> we say that which is incon|sistent with the infinite wisdome of God, for although neces|sary consequences may bee drawen from a mans word which do not agree with his minde and intention, and so men are oftentimes insnared by their words; yet (as <HI>Camero</HI> well noteth) God being infinitly wise, it were a blasphemous opi|nion, to hold that any thing can bee drawne by a certaine and necessary consequence from his holy word, which is not his will. This were to make the onely wise God as foolish man, that cannot foresee all things which will follow from his words. Therefore wee must needs hold, 'tis the minde of God which necessary followeth from the word of God.</P>
<P>4. Argument, diverse other great absurdities must follow, if this truth be not admitted. How can it be proved that wo|men may partake of the Sacrament of the Lords supper, un|lesse wee prove it by necessary consequence from Scripture?
<PB N="244" REF="131">
How can it bee proved that this or that Church, is a true Church, and the Ministery thereof, a true Ministery, and the Baptisme Ministered therein true Baptisme? Sure no expresse Scripture will prove it, but necessary consequence will. How shall this or that individuall beleever, collect from Scripture, that to him, even to him the Covenant of grace and the pro|mises thereof belong? Will Scripture prove this otherwise, than by necessary consequence? How will it be proved from Scripture, that the late warre against the Popish and Prelati|call party, in desence of our Religion and Liberties, was lawfull, that the solemne League and Covenant was an ac|ceptable service to God? Necessary consequence from Scrip|ture will prove all this; but expresse Scriptures will not. The like I say of fastings and thansgiving now and then, upon this or that occasion, God calls us to these dueties, and it is his will that we performe them, yet this cannot bee proved from Scripture, but by necessary consequences.</P>
<P>This fourth Argument will serve for the extension of the present assertion (which I now prove) to 'its just lati|tude, that is, that Arguments from Scripture by necessary consequence, will not onely help to prove and strengthen such things which may bee otherwise proved from expresse and plain Scriptures, but will be good and sufficient to prove such things to be by the will and appointment of God, or as we commonly say, <HI>Iure divino</HI> which cannot be proved to be such, from any expresse Text of Scripture.</P>
<P>5. Argument, I shall here take notice of the concession of <HI>Theophilus Nicolaides,</HI> the <HI>Socinian</HI> in his <HI>Tractat, de Ecclesia &amp; missione ministrorum, cap.</HI> 10. <HI>pag:</HI> 121. Although hee profes|seth his dissent, both from the Reformed and Romane Chur|ches thus far, that he doeth not beleeve things drawen by con|sequence from Scripture to be equally necessary to salvation, as those things contained expressely in Scripture, yet he yeeld|deth
<PB N="245" REF="131">
the things drawne by consequence to be as certaine as the the other, <HI>quantumuis,</HI> saith he, <HI>aeque certa sint quae ex sacris li|teris de ducuntur at&abque; ea quae in illis expresse &amp;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>habentur.</HI> And generally it may be observed, that even they who most cry downe consequences from Scripture, and call for expresse Scriptures, do notwithstanding, when themselves come to prove from Scripture their particular Tenents, bring no o|ther but consequentiall prooffs. So farre is wisdome justi|fied, not onely of her Children, but even of her Enemies. Neither is it possible that any <HI>Socinian, Erastian, &amp;c.</HI> can dis|put from Scripture against a Christian, who receaveth and beleeveth the Scripture to be the word of God, but hee must needs take himself to consequentiall prooffs: for no Chri|stian will deny what is <GAP DESC="foreign"> literally and syllabically in Scrip|ture, but all the controversies of Faith or Religion in the Christian world, were and are concerning the sense of Scrip|ture, and consequences, drawne from Scripture.</P>
<P>6. Argument. If wee do not admit necessary consequences from Sripture to prove a <HI>jus divinum,</HI> wee shall deny to the great God that which is a priviledge of the little Gods or Magistrates. Take but one instance in our own age; When the Earle of <HI>Strafford</HI> was impeached for high treason, one of his defences was, that no Law of the Land had determined any of those particulars, which were proved against him to be high treason. Which defence of his was not confuted by any Law, which literally and syllabically made many of those particulars to be high treason, but by comparing together of severall Lawes, and severall matters of fact, and by drawing of necessary consequences from one thing to another, which made up against him a constructive treason. If there be a con|structive or consequentiall <HI>jus humanum,</HI> there must be much more (for the considerations before mentioned) a con|structive or consequentiall <HI>jus divinum.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of an assurance of an interest in Christ, by the marks and fruits of sanctification, and namely by love to the Brethren. Also how this agreeth with, or differeth from assurance by the Testimony of the Spirit? and whether there can bee any well grounded as|surance without marks of grace.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_TIs a right, a safe, a sure way to seek after, and to enjoy assurance of our interest in Christ, and in the Cove|nant of grace, by the marks and fruits of Sanctifica|tion. Which (before I come to the proof of it) that it may not be mistaken, but understood aright, take these three cautions; first, our best marks can contribute nothing to our justification, but onely to our consolation, cannot availe to peace with God, but to peace with our selves; gracious marks can prove our justification and peace with God, but cannot be instrumentall towards it, that is proper to faith. Faith cannot lodge in the soule alone, and without other graces, yet faith alone justifies before God. Secondly, beware that marks of grace doe not lead us from Christ, or make us looke upon our selves, as any thing at all out of Christ. Thou bea|rest not the root; but the root beares thee. Christ is made unto us of God, sanctification as well as righteousnesse. Thy very inherent grace and sanctification is in Christ, as light in the sunne, as water in the fountaine, as sap in the roote, as money in the treasure. 'Tis thine onely by irradiation, efflu|ence, diffusion, and debursement from Jesus Christ. 'Tis Christs by propriety, thine onely by participation. 'Tis thy Union with Christ, which conveighs the habits of grace to thy soule. 'Tis thy communion with Christ, which stirs up, actuateth, and putteth forth those habits into holy dueties
<PB N="247" REF="132">
and operations. 'Tis no acceptable duetie, no good fruit, which flowes not from the inward acting and exerciseing of grace in the soule. 'Tis no right acting of grace in the soule, which floweth not from habituall grace, and a new nature. 'Tis no new nature which floweth not from Christ. Thirdly, all thy markes will leave thee in the darke, if the spirit of grace do not open thine eyes, that thou mayest know the things which are freely given thee of God. <HI>Hagar</HI> could not see the well, though she was beside it, till her eyes were opened. Markes of grace are uselesse, undiscernable, and unsatisfactory, to the deserted and overclouded soule. These cautions being in our eye, that we may not separat our markes, either from the free grace of God, or from Christ, or from the spirit: I proceed to the proof of that point, which I propounded in the beginning.</P>
<P>First, It may bee aboundantly proved from these Texts, <HI>Psal:</HI> 17. 3. and 119. 6. 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 1. 12. 1 <HI>John</HI> 1. 6, 7. and 2. 3. and 3. 9, 10, 14.</P>
<P>Secondly, our passing from the state of nature and wrath, into the state of grace, and to bee in Christ, is compared in Scripture to such things as are most decernable, and percep|tible by their proper markes. 'Tis called a passing from death<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isi. d. His|pal. de dif|fer. spirit. diff. 32. Dilectio in Deum origo est dilectio|nis in pro|ximum; &amp; dilectio in proximu~, cognitio est dile|ctionis in deum.</NOTE> to life, from darknesse to light, from being farre off, to be near, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which things are known by manifest and certaine evi|dences. The spirit of grace is compared to fire, water, winde, which are known by sensible signes. Conversion is a return|ing of one who had turned away, and is not returning discer|nable by certaine tokens? The new creature is a good tree, and is not a good tree known by good fruits, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. 17, 18.</P>
<P>Thirdly, both in Philosophy and Divinity; yea, in com|mon sense 'tis allowed to reason from the effects to the causes, here is burning, therefore here is fire; here is the blossoming
<PB N="248" REF="133">
of trees and flowers, therefore it is spring, and the Sunne is turning again in his course; here is perfect day light&punc; therefore the Sunne is risen; here is good fruit growing, therefore here is a good tree. 'Tis a consequence no lesse sure and infallible, here is unfeigned love to the brethen, therefore here is rege|neration; here are spirituall motions, affections, desires, acts and operations, therefore here is spirituall life.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the markes of grace have so much evidence in them, as formeth in others of the Saints and servants of God, a well grounded judgement; yea, perswasion of charity, that those in whom they behold these markes, are in the state of grace and regeneration. If they could see into the hearts of others, to bee sure of the sincerity and soundnesse of their graces, they could have a judgement of certainty concerning them. But this they cannot, for who knowes the things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in him. Sure a Saint may know more of himselfe then another Saint can know of him, for hee is conscious to the sincerity of his owne heart in in those things, whereof another Saint sees but the outside. And unlesse one will say, that a Saint can know no more of himself by marks, then another Saint can know of him by the same markes, it must needs be yeelded that, a Saint may cer|tainly and assuredly know himselfe by the marks of grace which are in him.</P>
<P>Fifthly, without a tryall by markes, wee cannot distinguish between a well grounded and an ill grounded assurance, be|tween a true and a false peace, between the consolation of the Spirit of God, and a delusion. How many times doth a soule take Sathan for <HI>Samuell;</HI> and how shall the soul in such a case be undeceived without a tryall by markes? But it may bee objected that this remedy may prove, and doth often prove no remedy; for may not Sathan deceive the soule in the way of markes, as well as without it? Can hee not deceive the
<PB N="249" REF="133">
soule <HI>syllogistically</HI> by false reasonings, as well as <HI>positively</HI> by false suggestions? I answer, no doubt he can, and often doth, yet the mistaking of marks may be rectified in the Children of God: Wisdome is justified of her children; but the reje|cting and slighting of all markes cannot bee rectified, but is a certain and unavoidable snare to the soule. If marks of grace become snares to the Reprobate, that proves nothing against the use of markes. The word of God is a snare and a gin to the Reprobate, that they may goe and fall backward, and bee broken and snared and taken: yet the word is in it self the power of God to salvation. So, the way of markes is a sure and safe way in it selfe, and to every well informed conscience: When any conscience through errour or presumption mis|takes the marke, that is the fault of the person, not of the way of markes, and the personall errour may be helped by perso|nall light and Information, if the partie wil receave it. Where|as to make no tryall by markes, and to trust an inward testi|mony, under the notion of the holy Ghosts testimony, when it is without the least evidence of any true gracious marke, this way (of its own nature, and intrinsecally, or in it self is) a de|luding and insnaring of the conscience.</P>
<P>But it may be asked, and 'tis a question worthie to bee<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quest.</NOTE> looked into, (though I must confesse I have not read it, nor heard it handled before) how doth this assurance by marks agree with, or differ from assurance by the testimony of the holy Ghost? May the soule have assurance either way, or must there be a concurrence of both (for I suppose they are not one and the same thing) to make up the assurance?</P>
<P>For answere whereunto, I shall first of all distinguish a two|fold<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ.</NOTE> certainty, even in reference to the minde of man, or in his conscience, (for I speak not heare <HI>de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ertitudine entis,</HI> but <HI>mentis</HI>) the one may be called <GAP DESC="foreign">, when the conscience is <HI>in tuto,</HI> may be secure; needeth not feare and be troubled. The
<PB N="250" REF="134">
<HI>Graecians</HI> have used the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, when they were speaking<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. Steph.</HI> in thes. ling. <HI>Gr.</HI> tom. 3. pag. 1173.</NOTE> of giving security and assurance by safe conducts, or by pledges, or by sureties, or the like. The other is <GAP DESC="foreign">, a full perswasion, when the soule doth not onely stirre a right and safe course, and needeth not feare danger, but saile, be|fore the winde, and with all it's sailes full. So there is answer|ably a double uncertainty, the one may be called <GAP DESC="foreign">, when a man is in himselfe perplexed and difficulted, and not with|out cause, having no grounds of assurance; when a man doth doubt and hesitate concerning a conclusion, because hee hath no reasons or arguments to prove it, when a man is in a wil|dernesse where he can have no way, or shut up where hee can have no safe escaping. The other is <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is a doubt|ing that ariseth not from want of arguments, or from the in|extricable difficultie of the grounds, but from a disease of the minde, which makes it suspend or retaine it's assent, even when it hath sufficient grounds upon which it may be assured. Now 'tis the evidence of signes or markes of grace, which gi|veth that first kinde of certainty, and removeth that first kinde of uncertainty: But 'tis the testimony of the Spirit of the Lord, which giveth the second kinde of certainty, and remo|veth the second kinde of uncertainty. Take a <HI>simile</HI> two or three for illustration. The Scripture is known to bee indeed the word of God, by the beames of divine auctority which it hath in it selfe, and by certaine distinguishing Characters, which doe infallibly prove it to be the word of God, such as the heavenlynesse of the matter; the Majesty of the style, the irresistible power over the conscience; the generall scope, to a base man, and to exalt God, nothing driven at but Gods glory and mans salvation; The extraordinary holinesse of the Penmen of the holy Ghost, without any respect to particular interests of their owne, or of others of their nearest relations, (which is manifest by their writings) the supernaturall my|steries
<PB N="251" REF="134">
revealed therein, which could never have entered in|the reason of men, the marvailous consent of all parts and passages (though written by diverse and severall Penmen) even where there is some appearance of difference; the fulfilling of prophesies, the miracles wrought by Christ, by the Prophets and Apostles; the conservation of the Scripture against the malice of Sathan, and fury of persecuters. These and the like are characters and markes, which evidence the Scriptures to be the word of God; yet all these cannot beget in the soule a full perswasion of faith, that the Scriptures are the word; this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>I. Goodwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l</HI> in his Ha|glomastix.</NOTE> perswasion is from the holy Ghost in our hearts. And it hath been the common resolution of so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nd Protestant writers (though now called in question by the <HI>Scepticks</HI> of this age) that these arguments and infallible characters in the Scripture it selfe, which most certainly prove it to be the word of God, cannot produce a certainty of perswasion in our hearts, but this is done by the Spirit of God within us, according to these Scriptures, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 2. 10, 11, 14, 15. 1 <HI>Thes:</HI> 1. 5. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 2. 27. and 5. 6, 7, 8, 10. <HI>Ioh:</HI> 6. 45.</P>
<P>In like manner, a Scholler or a young disputant may argue and dispute (be it in Philosophie or Divinity) upon very right and sure principles, yet perdventure, not without great feare and doubting in his own thoughts, till he be put out of that feare, by the approbation and testimony of his learned Master who presideth in the dispute. The evidence of good markes while it is opened unto us, may make our hearts to burne with|in us, as those Disciples said, which were going to <HI>Emmaus,</HI> but yet our eyes are held (as it was with them) that wee doe not know Christ in us, or talking with us, untill our eyes be opened by the Spirit. No doubt they had much light break|ing in upon their understandings, while Christ expounded unto them the Scriptures by the way, and this light was with life and heat in their hearts: But after they knew Christ in
<PB N="252" REF="135">
breaking of bread, then, and not till then, came the fulnesse of perswasion, and then they could say, <HI>The Lord is risen indeed.</HI> Luke 24. 15, 16, 30, 31, 32, 34. Our inward evidence of graces or use of signes may bring the Children to the birth (I mean in point of assurance) but 'tis the evidence of the Spirit of God, which giveth strength to come forth. Without this evidence of the Spirit of God, the soule doth but grope after a full assurance, as it were in the dark; but when the holy Ghost commeth to do the office of a Comforter, then there is light and liberty.</P>
<P>Our assurance of justification, adoption, grace and salvati|on, is virtually in a syllogisticall way: Whoever beleeves on the Sonne of God, shall not perish, but have life everlasting. But I beleeve on the Sonne of God. Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Who|ever judge themselves shall not be judged of the Lord. But I judge my self.

The nature of love is described, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 13. 4, 5, 6, 7. <HI>Charity, (or love) suffereth long, and is kinde: Charity envieth not&punc; Charity vaunteth not it selfe: is not puffed up, doeth not behave it selfe unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evill, rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth: beareth all things, beleeveth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</HI> Come now, and bring your hearts to these particulars in your examination.. <HI>Is there no envying in mee at all towards the Bre|thren?

Is there no thinking better of my selfe, then of them?&mdash;So that a soul must attaine to a mighty high measure of sanctification and victory over a mans self, before it can reach to this to say, I love the Brethren.</HI> But suppose you finde all this love in your selves, <HI>doe you know they are the brethren you love; you know the brother-hood consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s in being united unto Christ, that is an invisible thing, none can know it but God onely; no man can say, such a one is a brother.</HI> And if you say, though I am not certaine that he is a Brother, yet I love him under the notion of a brother: to this it is replyed: <HI>Take all the Sects in the world, they will love their owne Sects as Brethren:</HI> And after a description of the <HI>Antinomians,</HI> 'tis added, <HI>These are the Brethren; do you love these men? Oh, there are many that goe by signes and markes, that cannot endure the Brethren, they goe with them under the name of Libertines.</HI> I have now the objecti|on before me, as full and strong as one of the best gifted <HI>Anti|nomians</HI> of this age could make it. For answer whereunto I will demonstrate these three things. 1. That this objection
<PB N="255" REF="136">
destroyes as much and more, their own exposition of this Text in 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 3. 14 That the Antinomian way of removing scruples and doubts of conscience, and setling a soule in peace and assu|rance, is a most inextricable Labyrinth, and layeth knots fa|ster upon the conscience, in stead of loosing them. 3. That this way of assurance by the marke of love to the brethren, is a sure and safe way, and hath no such inextricablenesse in it, as is here objected.</P>
<P>First I say, their objection militateth as strongly, yea much more strongly against their own interpretation of my Text: For the same Antinomian in that same Sermon, and others of that way understand the scope of this Text to be for comfor|ting the brethren against the difesteem the world had of them; the world hates them, <HI>vers:</HI> 13. But we know (saith he) that we are translated from death to life, because we love the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rethren; that is, whatever the world judgeth of us, we per|ceive and know one another by this mark, that we love the Brethren. In short, they say, <HI>this seemes rather to be a marke how my brother may know me, then that by which I should know my self.</HI> Which interpretation, how ill grounded it is, and how incon|sistent with <HI>vers.</HI> 18, 19, 20, 21. who seeth not? Only I now observe that they cast down what themselves build: For if I cannot know my self by the inside of love, much lesse can my brother know me by the out side of love: and if I cannot have any solid or safe comfort from this, that I love the Brethren; how much lesse can this comfort me that others judge me to be a lover of the brethren? And how do I know them to be the brethren who judge so of me? For (by their rule) no man can say such a one is a brother, so that they do but tye them|selves with their own knots, and must therefore either quite their sense of the Text and take ours, or else hold that this text hath no comfort at all in it, which yet is most full of comfort, and sweet as the honey and the honey combe.</P>

Do but observe their way, and you shall see that either they fall in at last into our way of gracious marks and qualifications, or otherwise leave the Conscience much more perplexed and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Crisp.</HI> in the 2. volume of his Ser|mons.

This is the great evidence indeed and the evidence which at last doth determine the question, and put an end to all objections.</HI> Well: But doth the

Spirit of God give testimony to the soule, any otherwise then<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. pag 483. 48<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></NOTE> according to the word of God? No, saith the same writer, by no means, for <HI>it is most certainly true,</HI> (saith he) <HI>that every voice in man speaking peace, being contrary to the word of grace, that voice is not the voice of the spirit of the Lord,&mdash;it is the voice of the spirit of delusion.</HI> Immediatly he moves this doubt, <HI>But how shall I know that this voice, though it be according to the word of grace, is indeed the voice of the spirit of the Lord, and be satisfied that it is so.</HI> He might have moved this doubt, which is greater, how shall I know that this voice or this testimony doth indeed speak according to the word, or whether it speak contrary to the word, &amp; so be the voice of the spirit of delusi|on. Peradventure he had found it difficult, and even impossible to answer this doubt, without making use of and having re|course unto the way of signes or marks, such as the word holds foorth: And this agreeth to that twofold joint witnes|sing, <HI>Rom:</HI> 8. 16. the spirit of God is not simply <GAP DESC="foreign">, a wit|nesse, but <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>qui simul testimonium dicit,</HI> he bears witness not only to, but with our spirit, that is, with our conscience, So that if the witnesse of our Conscience be blank and can testifie nothing of sincerity, hatred of sin, love to the Bre|thren, or the like, then the spirit of God witnesseth no peace nor comfort to that soul, and the voice which speaketh peace to a person who hath no gracious mark or qualification in him, doth not speak according to the word, but contrary to the word, and is therefore a spirit of Delusion. I shall not contend about the precedence or order between these two Testimonies in the soul, so that we hold them together, and do not separat them in our assuring or comforting of our hearts before God. And here I must take notice of another Passage, where he whose principles I now examine saith, <HI>I do not determine peremptorily, that a man cannot by way of evidence</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.

<HI>The spirit of the Lord must first reveal the gracious minde of the Lord to our spirits, and give to us Faith to receive that Testi|mony of the Spirit, and to sit down as satisfied with his Testimony before ever any work of Sanctification can possibly give any evi|dence; But when the Testimony of the Spirit of the Lord is received by Faith, and the soule sits down satisfied with that Testimony of the Lord, then also all the gifts of Gods Spirit do bear witnesse together with the Spirit of the Lord, and the Faith of a Believer.</HI> Surely such a Testimony or voice in the soul, as the soul sits down satis|fied with before ever any work of sanctification can possibly give any evidence, is not an evidence according to the word, but contrary to the word, and therefore not the revealing evidence of the spirit of God, so that in this I must needs dis|sent from him, for he casts the soule upon a most dangerous precipice, neither is the danger helped, but rather increased by that posteriour evidence, or after comfort of sanctificati|on, which he speaks of, for the soule being before set down satisfied with the Testimony of the spirit of the Lord, and Faith receiving that Testimony (so he supposeth) it cannot now examin whether its sanctification be sound or not sound, whether its graces be common or speciall, seeming or real: It implyes a contradiction if I say that I am assured by the evidence of the spirit of God, and by the evidence of Faith that I am in Christ, and in Covenant with God, and that not|withstanding I sit down satisfied with this assurance, yet I am not sure of the soundnesse of my Sanctification. Therefore to put the soule upon a looking after the evidence of graces, and the comfort of sanctification, when the soule is before hand fully assured and satisfied against all objections and doubtings, is not onely to lay no weight at all upon these marks of Sanctification, in the point of resolving or clearing the Conscience, but it is much worse then so, it is a confirm|ing or strengthning of the Soule in such a Testimony or
<PB N="259" REF="138">
assurance, as it hath setled upon contrary to the Scripture. And here is a great difference between these Antinomian principles and ours: We hold the assurance or evidence of marks to be <HI>privative,</HI> they yeeld no more but that it is at most <HI>cumulative</HI> to the evidence of the Spirit of God and of Faith. For my part I dare not think otherwise, but that person is de|luded who thinks himlseffully assured of his interest in Christ by the voice of the Spirit of the Lord, and by the evidence of Faith, when in the mean time his Conscience cannot beare him witnesse of the least mark of true grace or Sanctification in him. And I must needs hold that whatsoever voice in man speaking peace to him, is <HI>antecedaneus</HI> unto, and separated or disjoyned from all or any evidence of the marks of true (al|though very imperfect) Sanctification, is not the voice of the Spirit of the Lord, neither speaketh according, but contrary to the written Word of God.</P>
<P>I heartily yeeld that the Spirit of the Lord is a Spirit of Revelation, and it is by the Spirit of God, that we know the things which are freely given us of God, so that without the Comforter, the Holy Ghost himself bearing witnesse with our Spirit, all our marks cannot give us a plerophory or com|fortable assurance. But this I say, that which we have seen described by the Antinomians as the Testimony of the Spirit of the Lord is a very unsafe and unsure evidence, and speaks beside, yea contrary to the written Word. The Word speaks no peace to the wicked, to the ungodly, to hypocrits, to mo|rall Christians, to the presumptuous, to the self&punc; confident, to the unmortified carnall professours, to temporary believers. Christ and his benefits are indeed offered and held foorth unto all that are in the Church, and all cal'd upon to come unto Christ, that they may have life in him, and whoever cometh shall not be cast out, this is certain: but yet the Word speaks no peace nor assurance, save to the humble and contrite, to
<PB N="260" REF="139">
those that tremble at his word, to those that are convinced of sin, to those that do not regard iniquity in their hearts; but hate sin with sincere hatred; to those that believe on the Son of God, that love the Brethren, &amp;c. Now therefore the Spirit of the Lord which speaks not to the soul, but according to the word of grace (as is confessed) doth not speak comfort or assurance to any others, but these only. And if a man would know certainly whether the voice or Testimony which speaks to his Spirit be a delusion or not, he must to the Law and to the Testimony, and search whether it speak according to this Word. Tis granted to us that if the voice which speaks peace in man be not according to the written word of God, it is not the Spirit of the Lord. But withall tis cautiously declined by these men, that the voice which speaks in the soul be tryed by the written word. They tell us, <HI>it is not the Word that maks us</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Crisps</HI> ibid. serm. 16. pag. 492. 483. 485. 486.</NOTE> <HI>believe the Spirit, But it is the Spirit that makes us give credit to the Word:</HI> That <HI>it is only the Spirit of God that can truely satisfie the spirit of a man, that it is his own testimony; and not the spirit of Delu|sion.</HI> That as, <HI>in all Arts and Sciences there are some Principles&mdash;beyond which there must be no inquiry, so also in divine things.&mdash;Is there any thing in the world of better credit, or that may ra|ther be believed with men then the Spirit himself? Nay can any be|lieve, but by this Spirit? If not, then nothing else is able satisfyingly to bear witnesse to the Spirit, but it self. This is as if we should re|ceive the Testimony of the Spirit upon the credit of some other thing.</HI></P>
<P>Whereunto I answer first, Tis to be remembred, The que|stion is not whether the Word of the Lord can satisfie or pa|cifie a sinners conscience without the Spirit; for we say plainly that as the best marks of grace, so the richest and sweetest promises and comforts of the word cannot make the soule sit down satisfied, till the spirit of the Lord himself speak peace and comfort within us. Whence it was that after <HI>Nathan</HI> had
<PB N="261" REF="139">
said to <HI>David</HI> in the name of the Lord, <HI>The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not die,</HI> yet even then <HI>David</HI> prayed, <HI>Make me to hear joy and gladnesse, that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. Restore unto me the joy of thy Salvation and uphold me with thy free Spirit. Psal.</HI> 51, 8: 12. with 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12: 13: But tis ano|ther thing which is here in question, for clearing whereof, ob|serve that the efficient cause, or revealing evidence which maks us believe and be assured is one thing: The <HI>objectum fomale fidei</HI> or that for which we believe and are assured, is another thing. In humane sciences a Teacher is necessary to a young Student, yet the Student doth not believe the conclusions because his Teacher teacheth him so, but because these conclusions fol|low necessarily from the known and received principles of the Sciences, and although he had never understood either the principles or the conclusions, without the help of a Teacher, yet he were an ill scholler who cannot give an accompt of his knowledge from demonstration, but only from this that he was taught so. In seeking a legall assurance or security we consult our Lawyers, who peradventure will give us light aud knowledge of that which we little imagined: yet a man cannot build a wel grounded assurance, nor be secure because of the Testimony of Lawyers, but because of the deeds them|selves, Charters, Contracts or the like. So we cannot be assured of our interest in Christ, without the work of the ho|ly Ghost, and his revealing evidence in our hearts; yet the ground and reason of our assurance, or that for which we are assured, is not his act of revealing, but the truth of the thing it self which he doth reveal unto us from the word of God. Secondly, this is not to receive the Testimony of the Spirit upon the credit of some other thing, for the Spirit that speak|eth in the Word, is not another thing from the Spirit that speaketh in our hearts, and saith, we are the Children of God, when we receive the Testimony or evidence in our hearts,
<PB N="262" REF="140">
upon the credit of the Word, we receive it upon the Holy Ghosts own credit, <HI>comparing spirituall things with spirituall, as the Apostle saith.</HI> The holy Scripture is called <HI>a more sure word</HI> then that voice of God which came from heaven concerning his welbeloved Sonne, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 17, 18, 19. and so by parity of Reason, if not <HI>a fortiori,</HI> the written word of God, is surer then any voice which can speak in the soule of a man, and an inward Testimony may sooner deceive us, then the written word can, which being so, we may and ought to try the voice which speaks in the soule by the voice of the Lord which speaks in the Scripture. If it agree not, then we have not losed, but have made a right discovery and found out a depth of Sa|than, and so gained by the tryall. If it do agree, so likewise we are gainers, being confirmed in the assurance, not upon the Testimony of another, but upon the surest and best known Testimony of the holy Ghost himself. Thirdly, if these things be not admitted, and if the Antinomian argument which now I speak to, stand good, then it shall be easie for any deluded person to repell the most searching convictions which can be offered to him from Scripture, for he shal still think with him|self, (though unhumbled and unregenerat) it is the voice of the spirit of the Lord, which speaks peace to my soule, and this voice I know is according to the word, because I am as|sured by the same spirit that it is indeed according to the Word, and other evidence I will not look after, because I am to receive the Testimony of the Spirit upon his own credit, and not upon the credit of some other thing: The voice of the spirit which speaks in my soul is that, beyond which there must be no inquiry. I ask now, how shall the Antinomians convince such a one from Scriptur? Nay how can they choose but (according to their principles) confirme him in his deluso|ry, imaginary assurance? Fourthly, the very same Antino|mian Author, who speaks of the Testimony of the spirit of
<PB N="263" REF="140">
God in the soul, as that beyond which there must be no inqui|rie; and which puts an end to all objections, even he himself doth by and by tell us of <HI>aliquid ultra,</HI> and puts the soul upon a further inquiry, (which as I said before) shal either resolve into our way of assurance by marks, or otherwise leave the soul o|verclouded, &amp; more in the dark then at the beginning. And so I come to his seco~d evidence, which he cals the <HI>receiving evide~ce.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Though the spirit of the Lord</HI> (saith he) <HI>doe reveal the minde of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dt.

Doest thou see this voice agree with the word of Grace?&mdash;If thou doest receive the Testimony of the Spirit according to that word. If thou doest indeed receive it, here is thy evidence.</HI> Thereafter he moves this obje|ction. <HI>But you will say, if there be not fruits of faith following, that</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. pag 518. 519 520.</NOTE> <HI>faith is a dead faith, and therefore there must be something to evi|dence with it.</HI> For answer whereunto, first he rejects this as a great indignity to Faith, <HI>If faith be not able of it self to give Te|stimony, or must not be credited, when it doth give Testimony, except something will come and testifie for it, to give credit unto it.</HI> Next he answereth thus, <HI>that which hath the whole essence of faith, is not a dead, but a living faith: Now the whole essence of faith is no|thing else but the Eccho of the heart answering the foregoing voice of the spirit, and word of Grace, thy sins are forgiven thee saith the spirit and word of Grace, my sins are forgiven me,</HI> saith <HI>Faith.</HI>
<PB N="264" REF="141">
<HI>If therefore the Eccho to the voice of Spirit and word of Grace, be the essence, nay be the whole essence of believing, this is certain, where there is receiving or beleiving, there cannot be a dead faith.</HI></P>
<P>Now behold him at a losse, all resolves into this issue, no assurance by the Testimony of the spirit and word of grace, unlesse this testimony be received by faith, no entry and pos|session, no clearing of the title to the soule, no resolution or satisfaction to the conscience till it beleive. But then while the soule examines it self, whether it have a true lively faith, or only a dead faith, he dare not admit the tryall of faith by the fruits of it, as if it were an indignity to the tree to be knowen by the fruit, or to the fire to be knowen by the heat. Faith purifieth the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">art, saith the Scripture. Faith workes by love. Faith shewes it self by works. This <HI>Antinomian</HI> durst not adventure upon this tryall by the Scripture markes of faith: yea, to avoid this, he runnes into a great and dange|rous errour, that the whole essence of faith is nothing else, but the Eccho of the heart answering the voice of the spirit, and saying, my sinnes are forgiven me, as if there were no faith where there is no assurance of the forgivenesse of sinnes, and as if faith were quite lost, as often and as long as the soule can|not say with assurance, my sinnes are forgiven me. Again, may there not bee a false Eccho in the heart: may not a tem|porary beleever who receaves the word of grace with joy, say within himself, my sinnes are forgiven me? Where is the clearing of the conscience now? Is it in that last word, <HI>where there is receaving or beleeving, there cannot be a dead faith?</HI> But how shall I know that there is indeed a receving and beleving? The essence of faith is the receaving of Christ in the word of grace, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">esting upon him for righteousnesse and life. Now another <HI>Antinomian</HI> tells us, that <HI>to receave Christ and his bene|fites</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. Eaton</HI> in the ho|ny combe, Chap. 9.</NOTE> <HI>truely, doth necessarily include in it these foure particular points.</HI> 1, To know our lost state by the least sinne, our misery with|out
<PB N="265" REF="141">
Christ, and what need we have of him. 2. To see the excellency and worth of Christ and his benefites. 3. A tak|ing and having of Christ and his benefites to ones owne self in particular. 4. To be filled with great joy and thankfull zeal. If these things be so, then I am sure, many doe imagine they have receaved Christ and his benefites by faith, who have not truely and really receaved him: so that the (soul searching it self in this point, whether have I any more then a dead faith, or a counterfeit faith?) dare not acquiesce nor sit down satisfi|ed with that resolution, <HI>where there is receaving or beleeving, there cannot be a dead faith.</HI> For the soule must still enquire, whether is my receaving or beleeving true, reall, sound, lively, and such as cannot agree to a dead faith? The same Author whom I last cited, where he putteth <HI>a difference between a coun|terfeit faith, and a true faith,</HI> he saith, that the counterfeit faith<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honey combe. chap. 16. p&punc; 481, 482&punc;</NOTE> <HI>neither reneweth nor changeth the heart, it maketh not a new man; but leaveth him in the vanity of his former opinion and conversa|tion.</HI> Whence I inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r that he who wil throughly &amp; rightly exa|mine himself in this particular, have I true faith, yea or no? Must needs (before he have a solid resolution) be put upon this further inquiry, is there any heart-renewing or heart|changing work in me? or am I still in the vanity of my for|mer opinion and conversation, yea or no?</P>
<P>I shall now after all this, appeall to any tender conscience which is sadly and seriously searching it self, whether it be in the faith, whether Christ be in the soul and the soul in Christ, let any poor wearied soul which is longing and seeking after rest, refreshment, ease, peace comfort and assurance, judge and say whether it can possibly, or dare sit down satisfied with the Antinomian way of assurance, before largely declared, which yet hath been held foorth by those of that stamp, as the only way to satisfie and assure the conscience, and to put an end to all objections. I begin to hear as it were sounding in mine ears

Their doctrine pretendeth to drop as the honey comb, yet at the last it byteth like a ser|pent, and stingeth like an Adder, I find their words at first to be soft as oyle and butter, yet I find them at last as swords and spears to my perplexed heart. I am forbidden to try my spirituall condition, or to seek after assurance of my interest in Christ, by any mark or fruit of sanctification, be it since|rity of heart, hatred of sin, love to the Brethren, or be what it will be: I am told it is unsafe and dangerous for me to ad|venture upon any such marks; I do not mean as causes, con|ditions, or any way instrumentall in my justification, (for in that consideration I have ever disclaimed my graces) nay I do not mean of any comfort or assurance by my sanctifi|cation, otherwise then as it flowes from Christ, who is made unto me of God sanctification als well as righteousnes. But I am told by these Antinomians, that even in the point of consolation and assurance, tis not safe for me to reason and conclud from the fruit to the tree, from the light to the sun,
<PB N="267" REF="142">
from the heat to the fire, from the effect to the cause, I love the brethren with true and unfeigned love, therefore I have passed from death to life. They say, I dare not, I cannot have any true comfort or assurance grounded upon this or any such mark. They promised me a shorter, an easier, a surer, a sweeter way to come by the assurance which I so much long after. They put me upon the revealing evidence or Testimo|ny of the holy Ghost, which I know indeed to be so neces|sary, that without it, all my marks will leave me in the dark&punc; But as they open and explain it unto me, I must not try by the written word, whether the voice or Testimony that speaks in my heart, be indeed the voice of the Spirit of the Lord, yet they themselves tell me that every voice in man which speaketh peace to him, and speaketh not according to the word of grace, is a spirit of delusion. Again they tel me this Testimony of the Spirit of the Lord will put an end to all objections, and is that beyond which there must be no inquiry, yet by and by they tell mee there must there must be more then this, there must be a receiving evidence of faith, and till I believe, I do not possesse Christ or his benefits, neither can sit down satisfied and assured. Oh then said I, how shall I know that I have true faith? Shall I try faith by the fruits of faith? No, say they, by no means, but try it by the eccho in the heart which answers the voice of the spirit, as face answers to face in water. But what if there be no such Eccho in my heart? What if I cannot say with assurance my sins are forgiven me? must I then con|clude I have no faith? And what if there be such an Eccho in mine heart? how shall I know whether it be the voice of a true faith, or whether it be a delusion? Hath every one a true faith whose heart suggesteth and singeth, my sins are forgiven me? But where there is a receiving and believing said they, there cannot be a dead faith. Alas, said I, they

leave me where I was: How shall I know whether there be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ombe chap. 16. p. 475.</NOTE> a believing or receiving?

Oh how have these men been charming and cheating me out of the right way? They have unsetled mee, and frighted me out of all my marks of grace, or fruits of faith, and when they have promised me a clear resolution, behold they leave me much more unsatisfied: They have deceived me and I was deceived. When all comes to all in their way, I must either conclude (which I dare not) that I have true faith, because my heart suggesteth, and saith my sins are forgiven mee, without any tryall of faith by the fruits thereof, or other|wise I am left in a labyrinth, believe I must, and they will allow me no markes to know whether I believe or not. Wherefore I will not come into their secret, I will come out of their paths which lead downe to the Chambers of death, I will return to the good old way, the Scripture way, Christs way, the Apostles way, in which I shall finde rest to my soule.</Q></P>
<P>The third point now remains, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is no such inextricable difficulty, darknesse or mist in this mark, the love of the brethren; but that the children of God may, and some|times do clearly and safely assure their hearts by this mark, that they have passed from death to life. Which that it may
<PB N="269" REF="143">
appeare, I shall speak first to the Object, the Brethren, then to the Act, which is love.</P>
<P>Touching the Object, let foure things be observed. First. this we certainly know, that there are Saints on earth, we be|lieve the holy universall Church: Now all who have passed from death to life, those and none but those have a true and sincere love to the saints in generall, praying heartily for them, sympathizing with their suffering, and rejoycing at their feli|city. None but a Saint can say in truth, and with a sincere selfe-denying affection, <HI>If I forget thee O Ierusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning; If: I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to theroof of my mouth; If I preferre not Ierusalem above my chief joy.</HI> Ps. 137. 5. 6. The Apostle commends pray|ing <HI>for all Saints, Eph:</HI> 6. 18. and love <HI>to all the Saints. Col:</HI> 1. 4. I conceive he means, not only all the Saints known to us, but the whole invisible Church of Saints on earth. That pray|er and protestation, <HI>Psal.</HI> 122. 7, 8. when uttered in Spirit and Truth, can proceed from no other, but a gracious renewed heart; <HI>peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy Palaces. For my brethren and companions sake, I will now say&punc; peace be within thee.</HI> This very love to the Saints in generall as to the excel|lent and precious ones of the earth, is a fruit of Sanctification, and a mark of a renewed and gracious estate; even as contrary wise they that have no love to the Saints in their <HI>species</HI> or kind, that love and esteem men only for some earthly respect and consideration, the Rich, the Honourable, the Mighty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or for some particular humane relation, Parents, Wives, Children, Kindred Friends, Benefactors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> much more they that delight in the company and fellowship of the prophane and ungodly, prove themselves to be such as have not yet passed from death to life.</P>
<P>Secondly, tis neither necessary nor possible that we have a a certain and infallible knowledge of the true Saintship and re|generation
<PB N="270" REF="144">
of these particular persons whom we love, under the notion of Brethren and Saints. The Apostles themselves did once look upon and love some as Saints, who were no Saints, <HI>Iudas, Simon Magus, Ananias,</HI> and <HI>Saphyra,</HI> and o|thers of that kind. It is Gods own prerogative to know cer|tainly the hearts of men. To require a certain knowledge of the Saintship of others, before we can say, we love the Bre|thren, doth not only strike at the mark of love, but at the duty of love, and makes the yoke of Christ heavy, yea unsuppor|table, and the very Evangelicall commandment of love to be most grievous, yea impossible: And if the Antinomian obje|ction hold good, no man on earth can performe acceptably this duety of Love, except he know the hearts of those whom he loves under the notion of Saints. If it be replyed that the commandement of Christ is acceptably performed, when to my best knowledge and observation, and according to the best tryall which one Christian is allowed by Christ to take of another, they are Saints whom I love under that notion, and that ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> not necessary to the acceptable p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rformance of the duty of love, that I know infallibly such a one to be a true Saint: Then it will follow by the like rule and by parity of reason, that comfort and assurance may be had from this mark, I love the Brethren, although I cannot certainly and infallibly say, these whom I love are true Saints. For if I can be cleare in point of the duety, and that my obedience to the new com|mandement of Christ, <HI>love one another,</HI> is acceptable to God, then may I also be clear in point of the mark or signe, this proposition, <HI>I love the Brethren,</HI> being a necessary consequent from that proposition, <HI>I have, through the grace of Christ, so far performed the duty of Love, as that it is acceptable to God in point of new obedience,</HI> and this leads me to a third answer.</P>
<P>3. Particular or individuall Saints may be so farre known by their fruits, and are so farre discernable and visible, as that
<PB N="271" REF="144">
our love to them under that notion may be known to be an acceptable service to God, and so a comfortable mark or evi|dence to our selves. Which plainly appears from what Christ saith <HI>Math:</HI> 10. 41. 42. <HI>He that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward; And he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous mans reward. And whoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones, a cup of cold water onely, in the name of a Disciple, verily. I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward</HI> Before verse 11. <HI>Into whatsoever City or Town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy, and there abide till ye goe thence.</HI> Heb: 6. 20. <HI>For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of Love which ye have shewed towards his name, in that ye have ministred to the Saints, and do minister.</HI> These believing Hebrews did not in|fallibly know that they were Saints to whom they ministred, yet the Apostle tels them, their worke was acceptable to God, and made himself to be perswaded of them things that accompany Salvation. They to whom he writes, being consci|ous to themselves of the truth and sincerity of their love, might much more be perswaded of themselves things that accompany Salvation from this mark of Love, although they could not know infallibly the hearts of those whom they loved, as Saints. We may without either revelation or infalli|bility of judgement, by the marks which the word gives us for judging and discerning of others, so farre be perswaded in a judgement of Charity, that this or that person is a Saint, a Brother, a Sister, one in Christ, as that our love to the per|son under that notion, is according to the rules of Christ, flowes from faith which worketh by love, and is acceptable to God as a part of our new obedience. If it were not so, this absurdity would also follow, there could be no communion of Saints one with another, at least no such thing done in faith. Do not Believers act in Faith, and not doubtingly, when
<PB N="272" REF="145">
they have communion one with another, when they exhort and comfort one another, when they pray one with another, when they sympathize one with another? If they do not act these things in Faith, they sinne, for <HI>whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin.</HI> 4. It is to be observed that he who objects to others, they cannot know whether this or that man be a Brother, even he himself akes upon him to judge, who are the Bre|thren. He makes a description of the Antinomians, under fair and plausible expressions, and then concludes, <HI>These are the Brethren, do ye love these men?</HI> It seems, if it had been conde|scended upon, that the Antinomians are the Brethren, there had been an end of his objection. But is not this Popish, Do|natisticall, Pharisaicall, to appropriat to themselves the name of the Brethren, the godly partie, the true Church, excluding many thousands of those who are truly godly, and dear to Je|sus Christ, although different in opinion from them? And what if one should fancy that the Antinomians are only the Brethren, yet how should one know that this or that Antino|mian is a Brother? Doth not his own objection fall upon him, the Brother-hood consists in being united unto Christ, that is an invisible thing, none can know it, but God only, no man can say such a one is a Brother? So much of the certainty of the Object, the Brethren. Now to the certainty of the Act, which is Love.</P>
<P>The nature of Love was described out of 1 Cor. 13. 4, 5, 6, 7. Then to fright the soul from examining it self by this mark, it was added, <HI>Is there no envying at all towards the Brethren? Is there no thinking evill of any of the Brethren? Is there no seeking</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Honey combe, chap 6. pag. 45 6</NOTE> <HI>my self or my own good, in my love to them? &amp;c.</HI> Who is the legal Preacher now? Here is a racking of the conscience with neces|sity of egall perfection in our sanctification and Evangelicall graces? Do not themselves say that our <HI>Iustification is perfect, but our Sanctification unperfect;</HI> why then wil they not suffer the
<PB N="273" REF="145">
soul to take any comfort from the fruits of Sanctification, except they be perfect? When <HI>Iohn</HI> saith, <HI>hereby we know that we have passed from death to Life, because we love the Brethren;</HI> I ask, doth he mean, perfect Love which is every way what it ought to be? If so, then they put a false sense upon the Text; for there neither is now, nor was then any such Love in the world. Doth he mean of true un|feigned sound love, although imperfect? Then there is no place for their objection. For a true Believer hath in himself a true love to the Brethren, which Love putteth forth and ex|erciseth it self in a sincere and conscionable indeavour of all those duties which are reckoned forth, 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 13. as effects, or (if you will) acts of Love. This soundnesse and sincerity of Love may be a sure mark to the soule, although I confesse without this sincerity, the very work and labour of love is no sure mark to the conscience to examine it self by; for as the Apostle there teacheth us, a man may give all his goods to the poore, and yet not have true love. O but how shall I know (saith the doubting Christian) that my love to the Bre|thren is a true, sincere, sound love?</P>
<P>To that I say, thou mayest know it by these tokens. First, if thou lovest the Saints as Saints, and because they are Saints, not for their excellent Gifts or parts so much as for their Graces, not for any relation to thy self so much as for rela|tion to Christ. Tis true repentance when we sorrow for sinne as sinne: Tis true love when we love the Saints as Saints, that is, for this cause and consideration chiefly, because the Image of God appears in them. Papists pretend that with one act of adoration they worship Christ and his image. But we say with more truth and reason, with one affection and one act of love we love both Christ himself and those who bear his Image, both God and his Children. I mean, tis Christ himself whom we love in his Saints.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="146">Secondly, thy love, when thou lovest all Saints, <HI>Col:</HI> 1. 4. <HI>epist:</HI> to <HI>Philemon v.</HI> 5. And this followeth necessarily from the first mark. For <HI>a quatenus ad omne.</HI> If as Saints, then all saints. Lovest thou all the saints in general praying for them all? Lovest thou all the Saints in particular whom thou know|est, that is, thou darest not confine or limit this love to those Saints only who are altogether of thy opinion (which, it ap|pears from the objection before mentioned, the Antinomians have dared to do) or who have some intimacy of friendship with thee, nay nor to these who never wronged thee, never strov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">with thee, who never spake evill of thee; but all whom thou hast reason to judge to be saints, thou lovest them, wishest well to them, art ready to do them good according to thy po|wer, and if thou be at variance or difference with any of them, tho <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> prayest God to make them and thy self of one heart, and of one minde, and it is an affliction of spirit to thee to be at va|riance with any that are Christs: Canst thou thus clear thy self in thy conscience, and darest thou say these things before the searcher of hearts? Then is thy love a true Love.</P>
<P>Thirdly, thou art a sincere Lover of the Brethren, when thou lovest them in all their different estats and conditions, the Poor as well as the Rich, them of low degree, as well as them of high degree, the persecuted, as well as the prospering, the reproached as well as the commended. This is also a neces|sary consectary upon the first mark: For if thou lovest saints as saints, the variation or difference of their outward conditi|on, will not make thy love towards them to cease. <HI>Obadiah</HI> was a sincere Lover of the Brethren, and he gave this good Testimony of it, he was a kinde friend to the Prophets of the Lord, when they were persecuted by <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Iezabel.</HI></P>
<P>Foorthly, thy Love to the Brethren is true and sincere, when it puts forth it self in all thy relations, when a man de|sires to choose a wife that fears God, and a woman desires to marie none who is not godly; when a Master seeks godly
<PB N="275" REF="146">
servants, and a servant seeks a godly master; when a people choose godly Ministers, and godly Magistrats, godly Com|manders and Officers of Armies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And again, Magistrats, Commanders, Ministers, love, countenance, encourage and strengthen the hands of such under their Charge, as are godly: when a man if he be to choose a friend to consult with, yea if he were but to choose a Lodging where he is a sojourner, he desires and seeks after a godly Friend, a godly Family, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly Love is true and sincere, when the action of Love is not without the affection of Love, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 3. and when the affection of Love is not without the action of Love, 1 <HI>Iohn.</HI> 3 17 when love openeth both the heart and the hand, both the Bowels and the bosome.</P>
<P>I do not mean that all or any of these marks can be found in any saint on earth, without some mixture, of the contrary corruptions; for we must not look that an imperfect grace (such as love to the Brethren is in this world) must needs be proved by such marks as have no imperfection in them. If the marks be true, then is the grace true, and that is enough to the point which I now assert. But as the grace is not perfect, no more are the marks of it perfect. And as there is no faith here without some unbelief, no repentance without some impeni|tency, no watchfulnesse without some security, no contrition without some hardnesse, no self-denyall without some self|seeking; So no love to the Brethren without some want of Love to the Brethren, no marks of true Love without some imperfection and falling short, and no marvell, because no spi|rit without flesh, no grace without corruption. Feelest thou then those contrary corruptions, those roots of bitternesse in thy heart, if thou warrest against them through the strength of Jesus Christ, and endeavourest to have thy love every way such as hath been described, then God looks upon thee, and would have thee to look upon thy selfe as a lover of the
<PB N="276" REF="147">
Brethren. As long as thou art in this world, thou shalt have cause to walk humbly with thy God, because of the great im|perfection of all thy graces, and of thy love to the Brethren among the rest, and still thou shall have flesh and corruption to war against all the powers, parts, &amp; acts of thy inward man. Let there be but a reciprocall warring of the spirit against the flesh, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 17, so shall thou passe in Christs account for a spiritual, not for a carnall person. Neither do I say, that thou must al|wayes finde a perpetuall conflict or battell between the flesh and the spirit, or otherwise no ground of assurance. The Apo|stle speaks of warring, not of conflicting or fighting: there is al|waies <HI>bellu~,</HI> though not alwaies <HI>praeliu~,</HI> between the flesh &amp; the spirit. The new man dare not make peace with the old man, nay nor agree to a cessation of Armes with him, dare not allow or approve corruption, nor allow the neglect of means and en|deavours. Yet the new man is sometimes taken napping and sleeping, sometime assaulted and spoiled, and bound hand and foot, he may be carried away as a poor prisoner; but Christ will again relieve his own prisoner, and set him in a fresh mi|litary posture against Sathan and sin.</P>
<P>I hope I have now so far scattered those mists &amp; clouds cast by Antinomians, and so farre extricated a poore soul out of those doubtings into which they would drive it, as that a Be|leever may knowingly and confidently say, I love the Bre|thren sincerly and unfeignedly, and hereby I know that I have passed from death to life; which is a good and sure argument, whether we consult scripture or the experience of Saints.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THere are some Divines abroad who condemning<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Chapter was left by the Author not perfe|cted. Yet so much as is in the copie is printed for the readers aedificati|on, and to stirre up o|thers to pros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">cnte the like purpose, and in the meantime to make the best use of these.</NOTE> Arminianisme (and much more Pelagianisme) yet have not adhered to the orthodox Doctrine asserted by the most approved Protestants writers and received by the best reformed Churches against the Armini|ans, in the article concerning the death of Christ. These have found out a midle and a singular way of their owne, that Christ died for all men conditionally, <HI>viz,</HI> if they shall be|lieve in him, that he hath redeemed all upon condition of Faith. One of their arguments is because otherwise we cannot encourage sinners to believe nor satisfie a troubled consci|ence, nor keep it from desparing. Upon the like ground that all may be comforted (every man being assured that Christ died for all men and so for himself) M^r <HI>Moore</HI> hath written a tractat of the universalitie of Gods grace, and of Christ dy|ing for all men as himself expresseth in the title of his Book. Tis also one of M^r <HI>Saltma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sh</HI> his encouragements which he gives to sinners, that Christ died for sinners <HI>as sinners,</HI> as hee speaks, whereupon it followeth (according to the rule, <HI>&agrave; qua|tenus ad omne</HI>) that he died for all sinners.</P>
<P>Surely this is not the way (as is pretended) to ease and en|courage the troubled and terrified conscience: Neither can they by their principles minister solid comfort to a sinner, tempted to despair of m&eacute;rcy. All the scrupulosity and unsa|tisfaction of conscience which they object against our Do|ctrine
<PB N="278" REF="148">
(that Christ died not for all, but for the Elect only whom the Father gave him) followeth as much yea more (as I shall shew afterwards) upon their own way. First of all when they give comfort and encouragement to sinners upon this ground, that Christ hath dyed for all upon condition of faith, tis to be remembred that <HI>conditio nihil ponit in re,</HI> the generality of men can draw no result from the death of Christ (as it is set forth by their Doctrine) but that Christ hath by his death made sure this proposition, that whoever believes on him shall be saved, or that all men shall be saved, if all men believe: Now a condi|tionall proposition is true in the connexion of one thing to another, (if this be that shall be) although neither the one nor the other shall ever have an actuall existence. If Sathan and wicked men get their will, Christ shall have no Church on earth, if the Elect fall away from faith and obedience they shall perish, If the damned in hell had place and grace to repent and to believe in Christ, they should be saved, or the like. So what solid comfort can the soul have from that conditionall proposition (which is all the encouragement they do or dare give from the death of Christ, to all men) all men shall be sa|ved by Christ if they believe on him. Is it not as true and as certain, (may a sinner think with himself) that no man on earth shall be saved, if no man on earth believe, and for my part, if I believe not I shall be damned? If all this hang upon the condition of my believing (saith the troubled conscience) why then, hath not Christ merited to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e, and will hee not give me the grace of believing? That new Doctrine answer|eth that Christ hath merited faith and gives the grace of be|lieving not to all, but to the Elect only, that God hath in his eternall decree, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ended to passe by in the dispensation of his grace the greatest part of mankinde, and to keep back from them that grace without which he knowes they cannot be|lieve on Jesus Christ: That though Christ meant that all men
<PB N="279" REF="148">
should have some sort of call to believe on him, and should be saved upon condition of their believing; yet he had no thought nor intention by his death to procure unto all men that grace without which they cannot believe. This doctrine of theirs while it undertaketh to comfort all men and to en|courage all to believe, it tels them withall upon the matter that all cannot be saved because all cannot believe, that God will not give faith, and so not salvation either, unto mil|lions of sinners. What comfort is it then to know that all shall be saved, if all believe, when men are told withall, that all shall not, cannot believe, and so shall not be saved? This lat|ter they hold as well as we, therefore their universall com|fort taken from Christs dying for all men upon condition of Faith, amounts to as much as nothing.</P>
<P>The true and safe grounds of encouragement to faith in Christ are these. First, Christs all-sufficiency, if he will he can, He <HI>is</HI> able to save to the uttermost, <HI>Heb:</HI> 7. 25. art thou a sinner to the uttermost, his plaister is broad enough to cover the broadest sore. As Gods mercy, so Christs merit is infinite, and the reason is, because the blood is the blood of God as well as of man, <HI>Act:</HI> 20. 28. This is a good strong foundation of comfort, if a soule convinced of its own sinfull estate, and of the vanity of creature comforts, doth so farre settle its thoughts upon Christ that as he is the only Saviour so an al|sufficient Saviour. Then is the sinner so far encouraged (which is no smal encouragement) as to resolve there is vertue enough in the blood of Christ to cleanse my crimson sins, even mine. There is no help for me out of Christ, but in him there is help for all that come unto God by him. Tis a great part of true faith to believe that Christ is able and all-sufficient. Therefore he himself said to the blind men, Mat. 9. 28, 29. <HI>Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, ye a Lord, then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith, be it unto you.</HI> He that
<PB N="280" REF="149">
said, <HI>Lord if thou wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> thou canst make me clean,</HI> was not rejected by Christ as an unbeliever, but he got from him a good an|swer, <HI>I will, be thou clean, Mat:</HI> 8. 2, 3. So every poor sinner that comes unto Christ alsufficient, and believing that Christ and Christ only can purge him from all sin and save his soul, hath a true, though imperfect faith, and is in a faire way for Salvati|on There is many a true believer, whose faith cannot as yet rise so high as to stay and rest upon the good will and love of Jesus Christ to him in particular: But the soul believes the al|sufficiency of Christ, and that he only is the Saviour, and so cometh and draweth near unto God by and in Christ, as the <HI>summum bonum</HI> which he values above all things; and this his faith, although it hath not yet attained to a particular recum|bency on the love of Christ to him is a true faith, which Christ will not despise.</P>
<P>Secondly, Christs intention to die for all men and for the whole world, that is for all sorts of sinners in the world, and so for sinners of my kind, may every poor sinner in particu|lar think with himself. Here is an universall encouragement unto all from a true and real ground, and drawn from the will and intention, as well as from the power and alsufficiency of Christ, which I shall make good from Scripture, for he hath died for all sorts of persons, there is no condition excluded. For this I take the 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 2. 6. <HI>Who gave himself a ransome for all;</HI> so ver. 4. <HI>who will have all men to be saved.</HI> The meaning must needs be of all sorts, not of all persons. For besides that the Apostles <HI>all</HI> can be no more then Christs <HI>many. Mat.</HI> 20. 28. <HI>the Sonne of man came to give his life a ransome for many,</HI> this ve|ry Text hath aboundance of light to give it self, if we look to the context either before or behind; before there is an exhor|tation to pray <HI>for all men, vers.</HI> 1. which although the Armi|nians make an argument that all men is meant of all persons and not only of all sorts, both in that verse and <HI>vers:</HI> 4. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6.

because say they we ought to pray for all men universally <HI>pro singulis generu~,</HI> &amp; not only for all sorts; yet tis indeed an argu|ment for the contrary. For to pray for all men without excep|tion of any person is not commanded, but we find the contra|rie commanded. <HI>Ieremiah</HI> was forbidden to pray or make in|tercession for the obstinat, incorrigible Jews, <HI>Ier:</HI> 7. 16. <HI>&amp;</HI> 11. 14. <HI>&amp;</HI> 14. 11. God would not have <HI>Samuel</HI> to mourn for <HI>Saul,</HI> after he was rejected of the Lord, 1 <HI>Sam:</HI> 16. 1. and we ought not to pray for such as sinne unto death, <HI>i. e.</HI> the sin of bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s|phemy against the holy Ghost, 1 <HI>Io:</HI> 5. 16. <HI>Paul</HI> is so far from praying for <HI>Alexander</HI> the copper-smith, that he imprecats the vengeance of God upon him, 2 <HI>Tim:</HI> 4. 14. wee may not pray for the Pope who is the great Antichrist and sonne of perdition; neither may we pray for, but against Babylon, espe|cially after the people of God are out of her. We are bidden pray for our enemies, but not for the malicious incorrigible e|nemies of Christ. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">refore when the Apostle bids us pray <HI>for all men.</HI> His meaning is, that we should exclud no degree nor kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">en great o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> smal, Jew or Gentile, bound or free, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so he doth upon the mater explain himself in the very next words, <HI>for Kings and for all that are in authority,</HI> he saith, not for <HI>all Kings,</HI> but he will not have us exclude Kings nor Queens as such from our prayers, nor any other subordinat Rulers: When he saith <HI>all that are in authority,</HI> he means any kind of lawfull authority; for we may not pray for those who are in any unlawfull or usurped authority in the Church, Arch|bishops, Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which prayer were an approbation of their unlawfull callings in the Church. I doe not say that we may not pray for the persons of any Archbishops, Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but we may not pray for them as clothed with such an office or authority, as we are there bid pray for Kings <HI>quatenus</HI> Kings, that we may live un|der them a quiet and peaceable life in all godlines and hone|sty:
<PB N="282" REF="150">
so that a King or Emperour as he is clothed with such authority may not be excluded from our prayers: But if we look upon all Kings and Emperours personally, individually or num<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">cally, so it cannot hold true that we ought to pray for all that are in Authority, otherwise the ancient Church had been bound to pray for <HI>Iulian</HI> the apostate.</P>
<P>Again, if we look to that which (there) followes after we find <HI>vers:</HI> 8. <HI>I will therefore that men pray every where</HI> (or in eve|ry place) lifting up holy hands. What means he by <GAP DESC="foreign">? He means not in every individuall place without ex|cepti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n, for this were neither possible (because there are many places in which there are not, neither can be any to pray) nor fit, because we ought not to pray with lifted up hands in the streets or in the mercat places, there are fit places both for publick and privat prayer, and there are also unfit pla|ces either for privat or publick prayer. The meaning there|fore is, that the worship of God is not restricted to Jerusalem, now under the new Testament. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o:</HI> 4. 21. 23. But that any place being otherwise convenient and fit for prayer, is sanctified for Prayer, and that Prayer made in any such place is no lesse acceptable to God then the prayer which was made in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">emple of Jerusalem. And now why should we not understand <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>vers:</HI> 4. and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>v:</HI> 6. even as <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>vers:</HI> 8. and the rather if we consider what is interlaced, for the Text runs thus, <HI>who gave himself a ransome for all to be testified in due time, whereunto I am ordained a Teacher of the Gentil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aith and verity.

So that <HI>Beza</HI> did fitly expresse the sense when he rendered <HI>vers:</HI> 1, 2. 6. <HI>pro</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="150">
<HI>quibusvis, vers.</HI> 4. <HI>quosvis,</HI> and <HI>vers.</HI> 8. <HI>in quovis loco,</HI> to note an universality of kinds, not of individualls. <HI>Grotius</HI> also on <HI>Mark&punc;</HI> 9. 49. noteth the same thing, that <GAP DESC="foreign">, is used for <HI>quivis,</HI> not only in the new Testament, but by <HI>Aristophanes</HI> and <HI>Sophocles.</HI> Lastly, I know no reason but our Translatours should have rendered, 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 2. 4. <HI>who will have all manner of men to be sa|ved,</HI> and <HI>vers:</HI> 6 <HI>who gave himself a ransome for all manner of men,</HI> as well as <HI>Mat:</HI> 4. 23. they render <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>all manner of sickness, Mat</HI> 12&punc; 31. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>all maner of sin,</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> 10. 12. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>all maner of foure-footed Beasts.</HI></P>
<P>In the same sense I understand <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 19. <HI>that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">: which phrase the apostle rather useth to the Hebrews, to wear out that common opinion of the Jews, that the Messias was only to be a Saviour to them, as under the Law the Sacri|fices were offered only for the sins of the congregation of Israel. Howbeit I may further adde for clearing this Text. 1. Seeing the Text hath no more but <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, (as the Tigurine rightly rendereth the letter of the Text) <HI>pro omni,</HI> we may well supply it thus, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>pro omni filio,</HI> not <HI>for every man,</HI> (which though it be the expres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">on of the English Transla|tors cannot be necessarily drawn from the originall) but for e|very son, whether Jew or Gentile, <HI>i. e.</HI> for every one predestina|ted to the adoption of children, which I confirme from the two next verses (both of them having a manifest connexion with <HI>v:</HI> 9) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">or these all for whom Christ tasted death are called <HI>many sons v:</HI> 10. and <HI>they who are sanctified,</HI> also <HI>Brethren, vers.</HI> 11 See the like phrase <HI>Mark</HI> 9. 49. <GAP DESC="foreign">, for every one shall be salted with fire, <HI>i. e.</HI> every one who shall enter into life: for this sense is to be gathered from the <HI>v.</HI> 43, 45. 47. and when it is said, 3 <HI>epist: Iohn v.</HI> 12. <HI>Demetrius hath good report of all men,</HI> we must either understand all the Brethren, or make some such re|striction of that universall expression, <GAP DESC="foreign">, for most men

in the world knew not <HI>Demetrius.</HI> So <HI>Luke</HI> 16. 16. <HI>from that time the kingdome of God is preached, and every man presseth unto it,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. Now therefore there can be no further of <GAP DESC="foreign">, in that Text to the Hebrews, then in these other texts here cited. 2. It may be also supplyed thus, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and tis in it self true that Christ tasted death for e|very Nation, or for every people, for in him are all the Nati|ons and Kind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eds of the earth blessed, <HI>Act:</HI> 3. 25. Gal. 3. 8. that is, the Elect of all the Nations, which upon the matter comes to one and the same thing with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ormer sense, al|though the former expression suteth better to the context: yea although it had been said that Christ tasted death <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>for every man,</HI> (which is not said) yet every man could be here no more then <HI>all men, Rom.</HI> 5. 18. <HI>as by the offence of one, judgement came upon all men to condemnation; ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n so by the righteousnesse of one, the free gift came upon all men unto Iustificati|on of life.</HI> Wherein the second branch, <HI>all men,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, is no more, and can be no more, but all who are in Christ, or all regenerat and justified persons. For 1. by these <HI>all men</HI> the Apostle understands (as is manifest by comparing this with the precedent verse) <HI>they which receive aboundance of grace and of the gift of righteousnesse,</HI> and he addeth concerning them, that <HI>they shall reigne in life by one Iesus Christ.</HI> 2. The comparison between Christ and <HI>Adam</HI> clears it, for they are both set forth as publick persons, all who are in <HI>Adam</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e actually involved into the sentence of Condemnation, and all who are in Christ are actually translated from the state of condemnation into the state of Justification. But I proceed.</P>
<P>Another Scripture which hath been understood for Christs dying for all men, being indeed meant of all sorts, is 1 <HI>Io.</HI> 2. 2. <HI>And he is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world:</HI> which is to be expounded by that promise made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> that in his seed all the families
<PB N="285" REF="141">
or kinreds of the earth should be blessed, <HI>Act.</HI> 3. 25. <HI>Gal:</HI> 3. 8. and by <HI>Rev.</HI> 5. 9. <HI>thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by by thy blood, out of every kindred, &amp; tongue, and people, and nation.</HI> So <HI>Rev.</HI> 7. 9. after the sealing of a hundreth fourty and four thousand out of all the Tribs of Israel, 'tis added, <HI>After this Ibeheld and lo, a great multitud which no man could number of all Nations, and kindreds, and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robs, and palms in their hands.</HI> For which cause also the news of a Saviour are called good tydings <HI>to all people,</HI> or to <HI>every people, Luke</HI> 2. 10. So the Apo|stle <HI>Iohn</HI> who was of the Jews, tells us there that Christ is a propitiation, not only for the sinnes of himself, and of others of his Nation, who were then believers, but likewise for the Elect of all Nations and all the World over.</P>
<P>To the same purpose tis said, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 3. 16 <HI>for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI> Where <GAP DESC="foreign"> is of no larger extent then <GAP DESC="foreign">, which the Tigurine ren|dereth, <HI>omnis qui credit,</HI> not <HI>quisquis, that every one who believeth in him should not perish,</HI> so that <HI>every one who believeth</HI> is an exe|gesis or explanation of the word <HI>World.</HI> Howbeit if any like better the ordinary reading, <HI>that whosoever believeth,</HI> it comes in the issue to the same thing. For tis a great mistake to think that the world here is a <HI>genus,</HI> which is divided in believers and unbelievers, and that the word whosoever is added in refe|rence not to the world before mentioned, but only to one kinde or sort of the world. Which (by the way) is also incon|sistent with their principles who hold that Christ dyed for all, to purchase life to all, upon condition of believing; for if so, there can be no partition here of the world but the latter branch as large as the first. But if there be any partition here of the world, (I say <HI>if there be,</HI> for the Text may be understood, <HI>exegetice,</HI> not <HI>partitive,</HI> as I have
<PB N="286" REF="152">
shewed already, it is not <HI>partitio generis in species,</HI> but <HI>totius in partes,</HI> that is, the world which God loved is not di|vided into believers and unbelievers, but by the world is meant the elect of all nations, and this whole world is subdivi|ded into its parts by the word <HI>whosoever,</HI> that is, whether Jew or Gentile, whether Barbarian or Scythian, whether bound or fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For this, the Apostle explaineth the very same words, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 11, 12. <HI>Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed, for there is no difference between the Iew and the Greek: for the same Lord over a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l is rich unto all that call upon him.</HI> So <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 28. <HI>Col:</HI> 3. 11. <HI>Act.</HI> 10. 34, 35. And though some have with much scorn set at nought that expression, <HI>The world of the Elect, i. e</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Elect of all the world, yet it will puzle them to give any other sense to <HI>Io:</HI> 6. 33. where tis said, that Christ <HI>giveth life unto the world,</HI> or to <HI>Io.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">6. 8. where the Spirit is said to convince the world of sin, of righteousnes &amp; judgement, or <HI>Io:</HI> 17. 21. where Christ prayeth, <HI>that the world may believe,</HI> and the Father hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">th him alwayes as in other petitions, so in this.</P>
<P>The third incouragement to believing is, that Jesus Christ hath died, as for persons of all sorts and conditions, so for the expiation of all so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ts, and all manner of sins, and hath plainly assured us, that <HI>all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men. Mat:</HI> 12. 13. he excepteth only one kinde, <HI>but the blasphemy against the holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</HI> Where <HI>exceptio firmat regula~ in non exceptis;</HI> this being the sole exception, maketh the general promise the surer, that not some sorts only, but all sort of sins, yea of blasphemies, not only may, but shal be forgiven unto men. Now to be clear concern|ing that one sin excepted. 1. Tis not properly any sin of the se|cond table, but of the first, &amp; is therefore called <HI>blasphemy,</HI> 2. Tis not every blasphemy, for any other blasphemie is declared in that text to be pardonable. 3. Tis a wilfull blasphemy
<PB N="287" REF="152">
contrary to the illumination of the holy Ghost and know|ledge of the truth once received, <HI>Heb:</HI> 6. 4. &amp; 10. 26. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> which reason <HI>Pauls</HI> sinne when he blasphemed the name of Christ and was exceedingly mad against it, was not the blas|phemy against the holy Ghost, because he did it ignorantly. If <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ter</HI> had at that time sinned <HI>Pauls</HI> sin, it had been the blas|phemy against the holy Ghost and so unpardonable, for it wanted nothing, but knowledge and illumination to make it that unpardonable sin, which the Apostle himself, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 13. doth intimat. 4. Neither is it every blasphemy against know|ledge, but such as is joyned with a hatred of Christ, so farre that if they could they would pull him down from Heaven and crucifie him again. There was mercy for these who cru|cified Christ ignorantly, but no mercy to those who would do it knowingly. Moreover, although they cannot get Christ himself again crucified, yet they revile, reproach, disgrace and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rsecute him in his Members, Ministers, Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nances, and all the wayes they can put him to shame and dishonour. Now there are two sorts of these who sin by blasphemy against the holy Ghost. Some do not professe Christ and the truth of the Gospell, yet maliciously and against their knowledge re|proach or persecut it. So the Pharisees <HI>Mark:</HI> 3. 28, 29, 30. in saying that Christ had an unclean spirit, did blaspheme a|gainst the holy Ghost. Others do professe Christ and his Gospell, and truth, yet fall away to be malicious enemies thereunto, against their knowledge. Such a one was <HI>Iudas,</HI> neither is there any thing to move us to think that <HI>Iudas</HI> did not blaspheme the holy Ghost, except that he repented him|self afterward: But there is nothing in Scripture against the possibility of a desperat repentance in these who blaspheme the holy Ghost, but only that they can never so r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">pent as to be renewed againe, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">b:</HI> 6. 6. That all sin, 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1. 7. <HI>i, e.</HI> all manner of sin is purged away by the blood of Christ, and ato|nement
<PB N="288" REF="153">
made for all sorts of sinners, was also signified, both by Christs healing all maner of diseases among the people, <HI>Mat:</HI> 4. 23. and by <HI>Peters</HI> vision of <HI>all manner of four footed beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the Aire,</HI> let down as it were in a sheet from Heaven to be killed, and eaten, <HI>Act&punc;</HI> 10. 11, 12.</P>
<P>So that as the promise of Mercy and free Grace comes home not only to thy nation and to persons of thy condition, state and degree, yea and to thy kindred and Familie, but also to thy case in respect of sinne, it comes fully home to sinners of thy kind or case, it tendereth Christ even to such a sinner as thou art.</P>
<P>Fourthly Christ receiveth all who come unto him, and ex|cludeth none but such as by their unbelief exclude them|selves. Joh: 6. 37.</P>
<P>Fifthly it is an incouragement to believing, that we are commanded to believe&punc; 1 John. 3. 23. <HI>and this is his comman|dement, that we should believe in the name of his Son Iesus Christ, and love one another as he gave us commandement</HI></P>
<P>Observe the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e authoritie that commands us to love one another, injoynes also that we believe on Christ.</P>
<P>But if any shall say, I cannot believe, I have no strength nor Grace to believe, I answer, (and let this be the sixt incourage|ment to believing) That God sets foorth himself to be the <HI>giver of faith</HI> Eph. 2. 8. Phil. 1. 29. and his Son to be <HI>the author and finisher of our faith.</HI> Heb. 12. 2.</P>
<P>If it be objected, I know it is so indeed. But God works faith only in the Elect, and I know not whether I be Elected or not. I answer, thou art discharged (in this case) to run back to Ele|ction (which is Gods secret) and art commanded to obey the revea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed command, according to that of <HI>Deut:</HI> 29. 29. <HI>The se|cret things belong un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o the Lord our God, but these things which are revealed, belong unto us and to our Children, that we may d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e all</HI>
<PB N="281" REF="153">
<HI>the words of this Law.</HI> And therefore seeing ye are commanded to believe in God, and hears that he is the Author and finisher of Faith; Say with <HI>Augustine, Da domine quod jubes &amp; jube quod vis.</HI> And with the Disciples, <HI>Lord increase our faith,</HI> Luk: 17. 5. or with that man in the Gospell, <HI>I believe, Lord help my un|belief,</HI> Mark 9. 24. and request him who hath promised <HI>to give the spirit of Grace and supplication, that yee may look on him whom you have pierced, Zech&punc;</HI> 12. 10. <HI>to lighten your eyes, lest yee sleep unto death, Psal.</HI> 13. 3. For this looking on Christ (promised in <HI>Zecharie</HI>) is nothing else then believing on him. As the look|ing on the brazen serpent which was the tipe of Christ, is ac|complished when we believe in Christ who was typified thereby, as is to be gathered by comparing <HI>Iohn</HI> 3. 14. 15. with <HI>Numb:</HI> 21. 8.</P>
