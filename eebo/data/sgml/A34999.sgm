</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Control.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir, since that I, may freely speak my heart,</L>
<L>I think it not convenient, for my part.</L>
<L>My reason is, that now the King of <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>Is scarce in case, his Kingdom to maintain.</L>
<L>How then will he, be able for to lend,</L>
<L>Succours if need shoo'd be, to help a friend.</L>
<L>I rather think, the Danish Princess shoo'd</L>
<L>More sitter be, if that your Highness woo'd,</L>
<L>Be pleased to accept it at his hand,</L>
<L>Which by Embassador, he does demand.</L>
<L>Besides the wealth that Kingdoms does possess,</L>
<L>With plenty so of all things, in excess,</L>
<L>To be ally'd, unto that Crown woo'd be,</L>
<L>More advantagious, to your Majestie.</L>
<L>He being near, unto you seated so,</L>
<L>He woo'd no doubt, offend you more being foe.</L>
<L>And if your friend, he's proper to defend,</L>
<L>And at an howers warning, succours send.</L>
<L>But I am weak, and simple, and may err,</L>
<L>Wherefore it to your judgements, I referr.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marsh.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Lord says true, that <HI>Spain</HI> in such a case,</L>
<L>Can by no means, aid or assist your Grace.</L>
<L>But that which makes me, chiefly of his mind,</L>
<L>Is that your Highness, will not Pistols find,</L>
<L>Which make without dispute, the strongest hold,</L>
<L>For you can nothing do, without you've gold.</L>
<L>And if that you have store, your Highness may</L>
<L>Prevent a foe, your Kingdom to inveigh,</L>
<L>And with it keep, your Subjects too in awe,</L>
<L>If they shoo'd chance, to grumble at your Law:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8">As for to match, into the Danish Land,</L>

<L>You promising to aide, not long ago.</L>
<L>Wherein they plainly shew'd, their love and zeal,</L>
<L>Both to your Highness, and to your Common-weal.</L>
<L>I rather think, the Swedish Princess might,</L>
<L>In this your choice, pretend the greatest right;</L>
<L>For as she's rich, so by the Laws o' the Land,</L>
<L>She like a Prince, has power to command.</L>
<L>Which is a thing, not common ev'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y where,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Admir.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir I do think, and likewise will maintain,</L>
<L>That 'tis most proper, for to match with <HI>Spain.</HI></L>
<L>'Tis true, the reasons that my Lords do give,</L>
<L>Are very strong, if <HI>Spain</HI> shoo'd alwayes live</L>

<L>The King of <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nmark,</HI> all men know full well,</L>
<L>So tim'rous is, that hee'd not stick to sell,</L>

<L>Nor woo'd his friendship, were it firm and good,</L>

<L>These Lords, dread Sir, the business so have scand,</L>
<L>And argu'd to and fro, we have in hand,</L>
<L>That they have left, not much for me to say,</L>
<L>Therein unto your Majesty this day.</L>
<L>Yet what more I know, I'le be bold to speak,</L>
<L>Since my advice, it pleases you to seek.</L>
<L>As I conceive, the matter in debate,</L>
<L>Is to find out, th' advantage of the State.</L>
<L>Now Sir, the question that will hence arise,</L>
<L>Is which of these, you chiefly ought to prise.</L>
<L>A mighty Monarch, in another sphere,</L>
<L>Or else a Prince, less powerful that's near.</L>
<L>As 't has been said, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> 'tis true,</L>
<L>Is at this present, very hard put to.</L>
<L>Yet is he not, as men do think so poor,</L>
<L>But that he can, afford you Pistols store.</L>
<L>Which is as much, as if he men did lend,</L>
<L>Were you compel'd, your Kingdom to defend.</L>
<L>As for the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> amity,</L>
<L>So much as 'tother, 'twill not useful be.</L>
<L>My reason is, that as he has less pow'r,</L>
<L>So is he false, and changing ev'ry hour.</L>
<L>The Swedish Princess, as my Lord well said,</L>
<L>Is most improper, for the Prince to wed,</L>
<L>By reason of his Faith, and her belief,</L>
<L>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ich doubtless daily, 'twixt them will cause strife.</L>
