<HEAD>The VVord of the Lord to Zion.</HEAD>
<P>O Sion, who is brought forth in the beautiful and glo|rious Birth of the morning of the Day of the Al|mighty God, thou <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> the Bride, the Lambs Wife, O what tongue can express of what is felt in the heavenly Treasures and Fulness of the Most High, who watches over thee for good, and not for evil, in this day of thy great Tryal, wherein Judgement is begun at the House of God, that he may prove you, his People, in the sight of the Nations, and manifest his mighty Power for your deliverance in the pre|sence of the People, to the astonishment of all the proud and stout-hearted among t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e children of men. In the ability of the strength of the Lord I declare his Word to thy tender Chil|dren, O <HI>Sion,</HI> whom the Lord God beholds, how you are com|passed about with the ravenous Beasts of the field, and given up by the Children of men, for to be laid waste, and to race up the Foundation of your strength if it were possible, that so the pure and living Worship of God in the Spirit, may not be known in the Earth.</P>
<P>O dear and tender Children of the Immortal Birth, which maketh Self of no reputation, whom the Lord hath cal|led and chosen to be his living Witnesses upon the Earth, to bear Testimony of his great and glorious Name amongst the people; fear not Man whose breath is in his nostrils, neither regard evil tydings of what men intend to do with you: O be faithful upon your watch, that you may stand in a good Au|thority in the Light and Life over all the appearance of evil in the Inward-man, that would draw your minds from staidness in the Power of the Lord God, that so the evil spy of the mind may never have power, that would run forth in the reach of your reason, to judge of what will come to pass in the sensi|tive part, and so cause fainting and feebleness of mind; tho|row the dark Judgement, which is out of the Light and Power of God; as the evil Spyes did in the dayes of old, who brought
<PB N="4" REF="3">
evil tydings of the good Land: Therefore all you Servants of the Most High God, stand fast in his Counsel, who saith, <HI>I am God Alsufficient, walk before me, and be ye perfect,</HI> in that to reign over all, what ever is contrary to the will of God, that so in the free resignation of your wills, with all that you have and are, you may be a living Sacrifice upon his Altar, with singleness of heart, standing approved before the Throne of his Glory, with boldness and holy confidence, without the least doubting or wavering of mind, but that the Lord will go before you, and with joy and gladness of heart carry you through, what ever he hath determined, to the perfecting his Praise and Glory of his Name for ever.</P>
<P>And dear Friends in God, you are not ignorant of the the tender Love of our Father, who in the Authority of his own Spirit, sent to proclaim this day of tryal in your ears certain years ago, that every Child might look up to the Power of the Lord, to be prepared to meet him in the day determined, which now is manifest in the sight of all people that love the Lord; To whom I declare in the Authority of the same Spi|rit and Life, that your deliverance is sealed in the Eternal and Unchangeable Decree of the Most High God; let all the pow|er of darkness do what they are permitted, fear not you chosen Vessels, for not any more of the wrath of man shall have power then you shall have ability in God's Sufficiency to rejoyce, triumph, praise and magnifie the Name of the Lord, through and over all the wrath of man, all your dayes, until your Change come, and for ever when time shall be no more; and God will be the God of your families and tender Children, who never did nor will forsake the Righteous, neither suffer their Seed to beg their bread.</P>
<P>Therefore lift up your heads in the Power of the Lord, you chosen Vessels, for you shall prevail and overcome through the Blood of the Lamb, and the Word of your Testimony, and no more shall love your lives to death, that you may do and suffer whatever the pleasure of the Lord is, who was made perfect in suffering, and did go before us unto the Father, and now is come again to receive us unto himself; therefore all in the Light behold Him, behold Him, who ascended over all
<PB N="5" REF="3">
the power of Hell, and Death, and Darkness, who now in like manner is descended, whose coming we behold in the Clouds with Power and great Glory. Therefore dear Children of the Lord, with the Light judge whatever would cloud or vail you from beholding his glorious Appearance, so shall you reign over all the evil attendances of the mind; though they be ne|ver so strong or many, you shall in the Power of the Lord trample upon them in the Name of Jesus; whose coming is in the Clouds, to deliver every Lamb forth of the evil that assaults the mind, thorow the Manifestation of his Appea|rance; <HI>For as the Lightening-is from the East unto the West, so is the Appearance of the Son of Man; and as the Serpent was lift up in the Wilderness, so is the Son of Man lifted up in this his Day.</HI> O let your eyes be all fixed on Him, and your hearts stedfastly believing in his Name, without wavering, though the Devil tempt, and all the Power of Darkness do what it can, in the meek Life of Jesus you shall trample upon the head of the old Serpent, and reign in the powerful Authority over all the enemies within and without for ever.</P>
<P>And as to the Clouds that arise outwardly from men, who lay their Plots in the deep, and fetch their Counsel out of the bot|tomless Pit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I beseech you all in the bowels of love, con|sult not with flesh &amp; blood, but walk close with the Lord as at other times; as our brethren, <HI>Daniel, Shadrach, M eshach</HI> and <HI>Abednego</HI> did in the dayes of old, for whom the Lord appeared through all the clouds and power of Darkness, to the confound|ing the pride of <HI>Babylon</HI> in that age and generation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And certainly the Royal Birth of the Immortal Seed, which maketh Self of no reputation, shall see Christ coming thorow all the Clouds, with Power and great Glory, and in as great Majesty as ever since the world was made, for the Deliverance of his own Birth, that seeks not any thing but to glorifie his Name, with the loss of all, life it self, if the Lord requires it at their hands, to seal the Testimony of their peaceable &amp; holy Conver|sation in Christ Jesus, which is in meeting, watching and wait|ing, to receive the heavenly Vision. And dear beloved Chil|dren, steadfastly believe in the Name of the Lord, that the Birth of the one pure Will may be raised into its dominion in you all
<PB N="6" REF="4">
the Father may fill you with his sanctifying Word; and when you are sweetly refreshed, take heed of being hasty to utter words before the Lord, but sink down into the Eternal Power, and as it overcomes you with the forceable Power, and move<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in you, to make mention of the Name of the Lord, whether in Exhortation, Prayer, or Praises, O take heed of quench|ing the motion of the Spirit, but give freely up to the Power of the Lord, to order you in his own Will and Wisdom, what he will manifest thorow you, that so you in true obedience cast your mite into the Treasury of God, and give the Lord his own with advantage, which proceeds from a broken heart and a contrite spirit, whom our God will not despise, but will en|large our borders for our faithfulness, that so all the Assem|blies of the Lord's People, may be as the Assemblies of Pro|phets of the Most High, freely offering up to him the fruit of his own Vineyard, in the holy return of Praises, Praises, in the pure Demonstration and Power of his own Spirit, that the everlasting Praise and Glory of the Name of the God of our Consolation may be exalted over all, who hath and is esta|blished in his pure peaceable Kingdom in the hearts of his Peo|ple, and of his Dominion there is no end; <HI>For the Heathen shall be given Him for his Inheritance, and the utmost ends of the Earth for his Possession;</HI> Swords shall be beaten into plow-shares, and Spears into pruning-hooks, for he will break the battle out of the Earth, who is God over all to rule and reign for ever and ever; Princes shall be in love with Him, and the Mighty of the Earth shall submit unto Him, and all the Nations that are saved, shall walk in his Light, and call him Blessed, who was dead, but now alive, calling to all people to come, and believe in his Name, that Eternal Life may abide in them for ever. But all that reject his Counsel, the Light, to be led in the strait way of self-denyal, their blood will be manifest to be on their own heads, in the day of the fierce wrath, when he will be re|vealed in flames of fire, rendering his eternal vengeance up|on all that know him not, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore doth the Word of the Lord sound thorow me, in the heavenly Proclamation to all the Children of Light, with
<PB N="7" REF="4">
all whose faces are set towards <HI>Sion;</HI> Stand fast in the Faith, and in the Light, come boldly to the Throne of Grace, where the Fountain of the fulness of the great refreshings you will enjoy, that you may buy Wine and Milk without money, or without price: O come away, come away, in this day of your invita|tion, wherein <HI>the Spirit and the Bride saith, Come, and every one that it heareth saith, Come, and every one that is athirst, come, and every one that will, come, come and drink, drink of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely,</HI> that by the vertue thereof the wea|ry and heavy-laden may be eased, and all your putrified wounds cleansed, and all the issues of blood healed, and all the stains of the garment washed, that all the bowed-down heads may be lifted up, and the soul that hath been as a desolate widow, and as a stranger without a dwelling in God, and as a child without a father, now in your faithful obedience to the Light, the Lord will manifest himself to be the Husband of the desolate Widow, and an Entertainer of the Stranger, and with him the Father|less shall finde mercy; which shall cause the lame to leap as an Hart, the blinde to see, the dumb to speak forth the high prai|ses of the most high God, whose Mountain is, and shall be more and more set up a top of the mountains, and establish|ed above all the hills, and all Nations shal flock to the <HI>Moun|tain</HI> of the Lords House, in obedience to our God, who is ta|king to him his great Power, to manifest himself to be the safe|ty of them that trust in his Name, whom he will hide in the hollow of his hand, as in a munition of Rocks, to the con|founding the Enemies of <HI>Sion,</HI> and staining the pride of the glory of all Flesh, who shall vail and bow before him, and con|fess to the glory of his Majestical Power, That there is not any GOD like to him in whom we trust, and who will plead our Cause, and answer our Expectation, according to his own De|termination.</P>
<P>Therefore dear Servants of the most <HI>High,</HI> let not any of us be weary in well-doing; and above all things love the Lord Jesus, yea, love the Lord Jesus Christ; and in his perfect Light, Thought and Will, all in stedfastness and staidness of mind, keep your habitations, in perfect peace, that the Birth of the one, pure, holy Will may rule and reign over all that stands in the
<PB N="8" REF="5">
will of man, that so high Praises, Praises, may wait upon the Lord in <HI>Sion,</HI> and <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> in heavenly harmony may be sounded within the Gates of <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> who is made this day a Burdensome Stone to the Nations, but is and shall be more and more the Praise of the whole Earth for ever, and it shall be known more and more: Assuredly the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, through your dear and loving Brother, who blesseth and praiseth the Name of the Lord for you all who love the Lord Jesus Christ, and seek his glory alone, and nothing for self in all that you do and suffer upon the account of the Testimony you bear, in profession of his Truth, in the sight of all people: O blessed, blessed are you, you Self-de|nying-People! for what is before expressed, is your Inheri|tance for ever and ever: In which fare you well, fare you well, saith my Soul, in the Name of the Lord.</P>
<P>And all dear Friends, be dear and tender over the weak, and all that hath strayed forth of the foot-steps of the Flock of the Companions, in what you can, draw them, and gather them in the Bowels of tender Love, that the scattered may be ga|thered into the Unity, to lie down with us in the pure Rest, to the praise and glory of God for ever.</P>
