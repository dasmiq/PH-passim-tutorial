</ARGUMENT>
<L>WHen 'twas by heav'ns decreed that <HI>Asia's</HI> States,</L>
<L>And <HI>Priams</HI> race by undeserved <HI>fates</HI></L>
<L>Should fall; that lofty <HI>Ilium,</HI> and that frame</L>
<L>By <HI>Neptune</HI> raiz'd, should in a Common flame</L>

<L>From stranger seats we quit our own abodes</L>

<L>Our Fleet for Sea, and when men furnish it,</L>
<L>Uncertain whether we our course should bend,</L>

<L>Summer was scarce advanc'd, when to resigne</L>
<L>Our selves to fates <HI>Anchrises</HI> did enjoyn:</L>
<L>Our ports I weeping leave, and native shore,</L>
<L>And fields, w^c^h lately <HI>Troy's</HI> proud turrets bore:</L>
<L>With my Companions, son, my Gods, forlorn</L>
<L>An <HI>Exile</HI> I through the vast Deep am born.</L>
<L>A vast and warlike land by <HI>Thracians</HI> till'd</L>
<L>(Whose Scepter fierce <HI>Lycurgus</HI> once did weild)</L>
<L>In view doth lye; to us (by the same ties</L>
<L>Of leagues and worship) ancient Allies;</L>
<L>Whilest fortune smil'd: my course I hither steer,</L>

<L>A white <HI>Bull</HI> I did slay; there was at hand</L>
<L>A rizing bank, with Cornel twigs beset</L>
<L>And with rough myrtle for rude lances fit:</L>
<L>This place approaching, I endeavoured</L>
<L>To pluck the verda~t boughs, therwith to spread</L>
<L>The Altar; but a horrid prodigie</L>
<L>And strang behold: from the first shrub, which I</L>
<L>Tore from the ground drops of black blood di|still'd</L>
<L>Which with corrupted gore the place defil'd:</L>

<L><PB N="4" REF="7">Another twig I then assay, that I</L>

<L>But, when with greater strength a third assay</L>

<L><HI>Encelad</HI>'s body thunder-struct, is said</L>

<L>That all <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sicilia</HI></NOTE> <HI>Trinacria</HI> trembles, whilest a night</L>

<L>Hid in the woods this night we passe in fear,</L>
<L>Nor the cause of the noise could see: for there</L>
<L>Was neither Stars, or Moon: a gen'ral cloud</L>
<L>Did the whole face of heav'n in darknes shroud.</L>
<L>Now from the East the Sun began to rise,</L>
<L>And day nights mask had plucked from the skies</L>
<L>When a strang out-side of a man appears</L>
<L>From out the woods, his hands who suppliant rears</L>

<L>But, when he <HI>Trojan</HI> arms and habits saw,</L>
<L>He frighted stopt, as if he would withdraw:</L>
<L>Then hastily he to the shore did run,</L>

<L>I by the stars, the Gods, the common ayre</L>
<L>We breath, conjure you me away to bear:</L>

<HEAD>Some few hasty Refle|ctions upon the precedent Poem.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not, <HI>Reader,</HI> the ultimate end of our <HI>Poet,</HI> in this precedent <HI>Poem,</HI> barely to deliver the story of <HI>AEneas</HI> his <HI>Errours,</HI> or <HI>Perigrination</HI> from <HI>Troy</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> with those <HI>Accidents</HI> which befell him therein; which, (although there were in it, no further <HI>scope</HI> then that) yet is so trim and well contriv'd a <HI>Narrative,</HI> that it is of it self sufficient to entitle this a most excellent piece: No: our wise <HI>Authour</HI> had a more co|vert and mysterious design; and, in this wel-built fabrick of his gives us the full prospect of a well-order'd <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> with all the <HI>integral</HI> parts there|of; which whilest we endeavour to
<PB N="53" REF="31">
make out, let not the <HI>Reader</HI> passe sen|tence upon us, as guilty of perverting or violating the sense or meaning of our Authour, whose constant manner it is, to have a more remote drift, then what is perceptible to the eye of every vulgar <HI>Reader.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Com-wealth.</HI></NOTE> behold first in the grosse or general, our supposed Common-wealth, to wit, a ship, or Fleet at Sea, between both which the <HI>Allegory</HI> or Comparison is as natural, as it is fami|liar, and therefore needs no further <HI>illustration.</HI></P>
<P>Next we come to the parts <HI>integral,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The foure parts there|of</HI></NOTE> which, as members, compleat this whol, or body of our <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> whereof the first is the <HI>Prince,</HI> the second, the <HI>Council</HI>; the third, the great <HI>Minister</HI> of <HI>State</HI>; and the fourth, the <HI>People</HI>; Of which briefly in their order, and ac|cording to <HI>Virgils</HI> method and design.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince.</HI></NOTE> Behold in the accomplish'd <HI>AE|neas,</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> or supream Magistrate, as the principal member, or rather head of our <HI>Common-wealth</HI>: and him we will consider in these three Princely Attri|butes
<PB N="54" REF="32">
or qualifications, which are here given him: First, in his <HI>Piety</HI>: secondly, in his <HI>Wisdome</HI>; &amp; thirdly, in his <HI>Valour</HI>:</P>
<P><NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg"><HI>His Piety.</HI></NOTE><HI>Piety,</HI> with the <HI>Latines</HI> is first ta|ken for that due observance, respect and devotion, which we pay to God; and secondly for that duty and reverence we give to our parents; so that <HI>pius</HI> signifies as well <HI>dutifull,</HI> as <HI>re|ligious</HI>; and he that is truly <HI>pious</HI> in the one sense, will be so in the other: None was therefore either more <HI>Religious,</HI> or <HI>Dutifull</HI> then <HI>Virgils AEneas,</HI> our imagi|nary Prince. As a pregnant proof of both which take this story, which I ca|sually light upon the other day in <HI>AEli|an</HI>: Var. Hist. l. 3. c. 22. <HI>When</HI> Troy <HI>was taken, and sack'd, (sayes he) the</HI> Greeks <HI>pitying the miserable condition of the sub|dued</HI> Trojans, <HI>proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that it should be lawfull for them, to make choise of any one thing they pleased, and to carry it away with them</HI>: AEneas <HI>therefore, neglecting all things else, chose his</HI> House-hold Gods: <HI>The</HI> Greeks <HI>ad|miring the</HI> Piety <HI>of the Man, gave him leave to take any one thing of his</HI> Moveables; <HI>who slghting the most pretious of his Iewels,
<PB N="55" REF="32" MS="y">
and other goods, took his old decrepit Fa|ther upon his shoulders. The Enemy admi|ring at this second demonstration of</HI> Piety, <HI>gave him his whole Estate free, with liber|ty to go whether he pleased: adding, <GAP DESC="foreign">. that the most implacable enemies ought to shew mercy to those, who were religious to the Gods, and dutifull to their Parents.</HI> Hence <HI>Virgil</HI> introduceth him here fly|ing with his Gods, often praying and Sacrificing to the same; and, to say truth, <HI>Religion,</HI> (were there no other end in it, then <HI>a politick</HI>) ought to be the chief care and study of the Prince, as being the very <HI>Basis</HI> of all <HI>Govern|ment,</HI> and the surest tye of <HI>Obedience</HI>: whence, it rightly hath its denomina|tion, a <HI>religando,</HI> which signifies, <HI>to binde fast,</HI> or <HI>to tye.</HI></P>
<P>As for his <HI>Wisdome</HI>;<NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg"><HI>His Wisdome</HI></NOTE> that appears, as well in his readinesse to ask and follow good Counsel, as in his abilities in gi|ving the same: Hence <HI>Virgil</HI> makes him frequently consulting with the Gods; <HI>and good Counsellours are in|deed
<PB N="56" REF="33">
as Gods to Princes</HI>: often with <HI>Prophets,</HI> and <HI>Interpreters</HI> of <HI>Oracles</HI>: par|ticularly, with his Father <HI>Anchises,</HI> an experienc'd, and sober old man; with <HI>Sibylla</HI> (a great prophetesse, inspired by <HI>Apollo</HI>) that is, a person endued with much wisdome, whereof he was the supposed Deity; and with <HI>Helenus,</HI> a knowing and a well-known friend: a person as <HI>honest,</HI> as he was <HI>intelligent</HI>: mark what <HI>qualifications</HI> ought to be in <HI>Counsellours</HI> of State, <HI>Age, Experience, Wisdome</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI>: The <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> of <HI>Anchises</HI>; the wisdome of <HI>Sibylla</HI>; and the <HI>Integrity</HI> of <HI>Helenus</HI>: As for his abilities in giving good ad|vise, in directing, governing and ma+naging his Affaires, that appeares in the whole <HI>Series</HI> and course of his life: to enumerate particulars herein, would be infinite.</P>
<P>Lastly, for the <HI>valour</HI> of our <HI>AEneas,</HI> or Prince,<NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg"><HI>His valour.</HI></NOTE> that is also twofold: <HI>active</HI> or <HI>passive,</HI> of both which there are such clear and undeniable demonstrations, that we shall not insist long upon this head: the first appears in his several ranconters, often charges, victories,
<PB N="57" REF="33">
and triumphs: the latter in his suffe|rings, distresses and afflictions; in which no one ever shared more plenti|fully, than himself: How was he tos|sed up and down? how often in storms and tempests? how often driven from place to place? disappointed in his designes? Defeated in his at|tempts? still persecuted by <HI>Iuno,</HI> his mortal or rather immortal enemy: yet, behold him ever unshaken, unmo|ved, undaunted: still constant in the pursuit of his Counsels, till at last, o|vercoming the malice both of fortune and his enemies, he accomplish what he drives at, and what was by the fates laid out for him; and setting foot in <HI>Italy,</HI> there lay the foundation of a never-declining <HI>Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>And, now, <HI>most gracious Soveraign,</HI> it is not that I have wrested this Chara|cter, in delivering things otherwise, then they are represented by our Au|thour in the precedent Poem, that, I might direct this Application to your Royal Self: No, should I therefore compare your Majesty with our <HI>AEneas,</HI> in those three princely <HI>qualifications,</HI> above mentioned, none could truly
<PB N="58" REF="34">
object to me either force or flattery: As for your <HI>Piety</HI> therefore, whether in the first sense, as it relates to God, that appears sufficiently; our eyes see it, and our hearts re<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">oyce thereat: Our <HI>Church,</HI> that is, the Assembly of the faithfull, and our <HI>Churches,</HI> that is, the consecrated places, where those As|semblies use to be held, begin now, (under your Royal Protection) to re|sume their prestine beauty, and will (we hope) in time, <HI>Phaenix</HI>-like, rise up more splendid and glorious, out of their own ashes, that is, those defor|med ruines and rubbish, wherein they lay lately obscured and oppressed: or, in the second, that is, your <HI>AEneas</HI>&punc; like reverence to your <HI>Royal</HI> Father both living and dead: which manifests it self in your Justice <HI>Distributive,</HI> which consists in <HI>Punishment</HI> and <HI>Reward,</HI> the two principal wheels, upon which that great engin of a <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> makes its <HI>rotation</HI>; the first in taking just revenge upon the horrid murder|ers of your Royal Father, our Graci|ous Soveraign; a <HI>parentation</HI> indeed, considering the unparallel'd hainous|nesse and enormity of the fact, not in
<PB N="59" REF="34">
the least severe: the second, in restor|ing and rewarding his old Servants, and such as have either acted or suffer|ed for him.</P>
<P>As for our second <HI>qualification,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>AEn.</HI> 1</NOTE> we require in our Prince, and finde it in our <HI>AEneas,</HI> a <HI>readiness</HI> in taking, and an <HI>ability</HI> in giving good Councel, the first your <HI>Majesty</HI> hath sufficiently demon|strated as well in the choise of your <HI>Councell,</HI> and Correspondence all a|long with your <HI>Parliament,</HI> as you have the latter in your prudent ma|nagement of affairs, of which we all see the happy effects, and taste the blessed fruits.</P>
<P>But, for your <HI>Valour,</HI> both <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Passive</HI>; the footsteps and impres|sions of them are so fresh and so many, that we should loose our selves in the enumeration of them, should we but once enter upon them: <HI>England, Scot|land, France, Flanders,</HI> all the world rings of them: to be short;
<Q><L>Quae regio in terris vestri non plena laboris:</L></Q></P>
<P>And now at last, after all those strang
<PB N="60" REF="35">
and multiplied revolutions, we, to our <HI>ineffable</HI> joy, see your sacred Majesty, (like another <HI>AEneas</HI> in his promis'd <HI>I|talie</HI>) by the undeniable conduct of the divine providence seated &amp; firmly fix|ed in your <HI>paternal</HI> Throne, never thence to be removed, till such time as you shall be translated from earth to heaven.

<Q><L>That by the <HI>heav'nly</HI> conduct through the main</L>
<L>Thou dost advance: thus 'tis decreed by <HI>Iove</HI></L>
<L>Who that great wheel of things doth wisely move.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here then as the same Poet speaks in the person of <HI>Anchises</HI> concerning his <HI>AEneas</HI> in this very book, let us, as <HI>pro|phetically,</HI> I hope affirm and conclude, (changing one word,) concerning your Sacred <HI>Majesty.</HI>
<Q><PB N="61" REF="35">

<Q><L>Great <HI>Charles</HI> his house, with those who thence descend,</L>

<P>The second part which after the <HI>Prince</HI> constitutes a <HI>Common-Wealth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Coun|sel.</HI></NOTE> is his <HI>Councel</HI>: Here the Poet gives to <HI>AEneas</HI> as Councellours, <HI>Anchises, Si|bylla, Helenus</HI>: of whom we have alrea|dy spoken: we shall not therefore in|sist long upon this point: I shall observe in the advice <HI>Helenus</HI> gives him, (which according to the nature of his design, was seasonably-prudent) these two pre|cepts only: first he adviseth him rather to coast the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">sle of <HI>Sicily</HI> in his voyage to <HI>Italie,</HI> then to passe the dan|gerous straits of <HI>Pel&ocirc;rus,</HI> now called the <HI>Faro,</HI> though by much the nerer way, for fear he fall upon the rocks of <HI>Scylla,</HI> or be suck'd in by the violent gulph or eddy of <HI>Charybdis</HI>: to shew, that it is better, and more secure, to proceed.
<PB N="62" REF="36">
leasurably in affairs of moment, then to precipitate, and that a profest States-man, ought rather to chuse the safer then the nearer way: for herein our english proverb takes place, <HI>the fur|thest way about, is the nearest way home:</HI> Secondly he recommends to him above all things, by prayers and sacrifice, to reconcile and conquer his implacable enemy <HI>Iuno</HI>: for; as <HI>Donatus</HI> upon this place: <HI>Ostendit</HI> Poeta <HI>majoris potentiae ini|micos obsequendo potius, quam resistendo posse superari: 'tis wisdome rather to gain a potent enemy by obligeing him, then to run the risk of subduing him by force, the success where|of is uncertain.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg"><HI>The great Mini|ster of State.</HI></NOTE>Nor has <HI>AEneas</HI> his Councel onely, but, as a third Complement of our <HI>Common-Wealth,</HI> and a necessary in|strument of government; behold his <HI>Palinurus,</HI> or great <HI>Minister</HI> of <HI>State, cui Princeps incumbit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sen. de Con|sol. ad Mar|cian.</HI></NOTE> <HI>&amp; in quem onus imperij reclinat,</HI> as <HI>Seneca</HI> speaks of the younger <HI>Marcellus</HI>: the person our Prince pla|ceth, at the helm of State, and to whom he intrusts the chief guidance of that great vessel of the <HI>Common-Wealth</HI>:
<PB N="63" REF="36">
Now the <HI>Qualifications</HI> of such a <HI>Mini|ster</HI> are chiefly two, <HI>Vigilance</HI> and <HI>Dexte|rity,</HI> or experience in matters of State: thus <HI>Palinurus,</HI> whilest others slept:
<Q><L>Haud segnis strato surgit &mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>There's his <HI>Vigilance</HI>; Now for his <HI>Dexterity</HI> or <HI>Experience.</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash; omnes</L>
<L>Explorat ventos &mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>But to be a little more particular in Charactizing our great <HI>Minister,</HI> we will adde a note or two; <HI>Virgil</HI> then speaks thus of <HI>Palinurus,</HI> as we have (accord|ing to our manner, that is, imperfectly) rendred him.
<Q><L>Night was not yet half spent, when from his bed</L>
<L>Awaken'd <HI>Palinurus</HI> nimbly fled:</L>
<L>The winds observ'd, to ev'ry blast gave ear,</L>

<L><HI>Arcturus,</HI> and the dripping <HI>Hyadae</HI></L>
<L>The two <HI>Bears,</HI> with golden <HI>Orion</HI> he Contemplats:</L></Q></P>
<P>From hence we draw two wholsome precepts, and such, as above all others, must diligently be observ'd by our great <HI>Minister</HI>: First, he is to <HI>observe the

<P>And should I, Reader, say that our gracious Soveraign is blessed in such a <HI>Minister,</HI> in the <HI>Right Honourable,</HI> the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> the present <HI>Lord High Chancellour</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> I should say no more, then what is evident by those daily dispatches, which passe through his hands, and that weight of affairs which presse, but cannot oppresse him:

<P>Which the excellent <HI>Claudian</HI> applies to <HI>Stilico,</HI> the great <HI>Minister</HI> of State to the Emperour <HI>Honorius,</HI> and which I hope without offence to his Lordships modesty, or violence to the <HI>Poets</HI> sense, we may thus render in English:
<Q><L>Thus, when great <HI>Hercules</HI> his shoulders lent</L>

<L>Vnmoved hung: Nor did the <HI>Zodiac</HI> fear</L>

and therefore not <HI>Subsistent</HI> one without the other, behold our <HI>Poet</HI> gives his <HI>AE|neas</HI> a competent number of <HI>Subjects,</HI> which, he ever calls by the name of <HI>So|cij</HI>: by which word the <HI>Latines</HI> under|stand a <HI>Companion, Allie,</HI> or <HI>Confederate</HI>: in both which senses the people may most properly be called <HI>Socij,</HI> First: they are <HI>Companions,</HI> for they must ex|pect to accompany the <HI>Prince</HI> in his for|tune: if he be opprest, they must be en|slav'd; if he be dethron'd, and murde|red, their <HI>lives, fortunes,</HI> and <HI>liberties</HI> are all at the mercy of the Usurping <HI>Tyrant</HI>: We need not go farr for an in|stance to make good this: the late di|stractions out of which we are (by the blessing of God) now happily deli|ver'd are a sufficient proof of our assertion: Next they are <HI>Allies</HI> or <HI>Confederates</HI>; now such are bound to take up arm's for the mutuall de|fence one of the other, and that Prin|ce that offers an injury to the one, doth it to the other; thus the people are bound to expose their lives, for|tunes and all they call theirs in the defence of the Princes <HI>Crown, Dignity,</HI>

<P>But to draw to a Conclusion:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Con|clusion.</HI></NOTE> where|as our Author, in the whole, exposeth his <HI>AEneas</HI> to many difficulties, during his <HI>Navigation,</HI> making him sometimes to mistake his Port; sometimes to run upon a rock, and sometimes ready to perish in a storm; these (I say) are to hint to us those many <HI>lets, impediments</HI> &amp; <HI>difficulties</HI> that every kinde of <HI>Regiment</HI> is subject unto, which (as the learned Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> observes) <HI>in publick proceed|ings are innumerable and inevitable</HI>; and therefore the people ought not to fall out with their <HI>Governours,</HI> or cavill at the Government, upon every per|ty miscarriage; but soberly to consi|der, and weigh with themselves the forementioned difficulties, and not to object that to the Governour, which, is indeed incident to all humane Affairs; nor could, by the greatest wisdome and

forecast imaginable, be avoided: to judge by successe is <HI>irrational</HI>; for ma|ny times weak <HI>Councels</HI> take effect, when the best-digested <HI>designes</HI> are fru|strated, for as much as <HI>Chance</HI> and <HI>Ac|cident</HI> have a share in both: I could be copious upon this subject, and plentiful in instances, but I designed onely a few hasty <HI>Reflexions,</HI> and a running dis|course.</P>
