<P>_IT may be, some <HI>Rhetoric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> Praelector holdes it enquirable for the Title, as professing too much of affectation thereunto. Nor do I blame him, when, conferring the importance ther|of with our impotence, he deprehend not a reason in the very front, or first face of my Booke. It shall suffice, for thy better satisfaction, I was most inward with mine owne defects: which I studied to preserue from seuerer exposition, as thus: If any challenge me for dis|membring a good history, which might better haue beene continuated from the beginning, it was not I, but Passion. If, that my Introduction be somewhat too prolix, in respect of the maine sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ect proposed. All this was of Passion, that once enlargde, is hardly called in and restrained.
