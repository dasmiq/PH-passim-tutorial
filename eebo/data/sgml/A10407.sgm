<P>_I Have observed in private families, that the carefull father disposing of his chil|dren to several imployments, sends some to school, some to his plough, some to his flocks, while perchance the young|est, as uncapable of greater businesse, has the libertie to play in his hall. So is it in our Society (which joy|fully acknowledges you our carefull and indulgent parent) those of stronger abilities, more reading, and longer experience, are busied some in one, some in ano|ther of the graver and more serious studies: while I, the last of that learned Body, am task'd to these light|er exercises. Accept, Sir, a thing born at your com|mand, and preserved by your patronage. Not but that I vow the fruits of my more precious houres to your service: for when I consider the magnificence of our buildings, the riches of our endowments, the great ex|amples of those before me, and all these bless'd in your auspicious government; I finde a fire kindled in my breast, whose flame aims higher, and tells me, so glorious a hive the royall Founders meant not to shelter drones. So wishing our whole Body long hap|py in so provident a Governour, I rest, what my oath and peculiar ingagements have bound me to be,</P>

<P>_I Beg thy pardon, if I put thee to the ex|pence of a sixpence, and the losse of an houre. If I could by my own industrie have fur|nished the desires of my friends, I had not troubled the Presse. 'Tis no opinion of the worth that wrought me to it; if I finde thee charitable, I acknowledge my self beholding to thee: if thou condemne it of weaknesse, I cannot be angry to see another of my minde. I do not aim at the name of a Poet, I have alwaies admired the free raptures of poetrie; but it is too unthrifty a science for my fortunes, and is crept into the number of the seven, to undo the other six. That I make so many dedications, think not that I value it as a present rich enough to be di|vided; but know whom I am in pietie bound to honour. That I admit so many of my friends approbations, is not that I itch'd for praise and love&mdash;rubbing, but that I was willing thou shouldest have something worth thy reading. Be to me as kinde as my audience, who when they might have us'd their censures, made choice of their mercies: and so I must acknowledge my self indebted to thy clemencie. I confesse no heights here, no strong conceits; I speak the language of the people.
<Q><L>&mdash;Neque si quis scribit, uti nos,</L>
<L>Sermoni propiora, putes hunc esse poetam.</L></Q>
No, bestow the honour of that glorious title on those that have abler wits, diviner inventions, and deeper mouths: Leave me to the privacie of my studies, and accept for thy unknown friend</P>

<L>SIr, when I look on you, me thinks I see</L>
<L>To the full height, how perfect man may be.</L>
<L>Sure all the Arts did court you, and you were</L>
<L>So courteous as to give to each their share,</L>
<L>While we lie lock'd in darknesse, night and day</L>
<L>Wasting our fruitlesse oyl and time away,</L>
<L>Perchance for skill in Grammar, and to know</L>
<L>Whether this word be thus declin'd or no.</L>
<L>Another cheats himself, perchance to be</L>
<L>A prety youth, forsooth, in fallacie:</L>
<L>This on Arithmetick doth hourely lie,</L>
<L>To learn the first great blessing, &mdash;Multiply.</L>
<L>That travels in Geometry, and tires,</L>
<L>And he above the world a map admires.</L>
<L>This dotes on Musicks most harmonious chime,</L>
<L>And studying how to keep it, loses time.</L>
<L>One turns o're histories, and he can show</L>
<L>All that has been, but knows not what is now.</L>
<L>Many in Physick labour, most of these</L>
<L>Lose health, to know the name of a disease.</L>
<L>Some (too high wise) are gazing at a starre,</L>
<L>And if they call it by his name, they are</L>
<L>In heaven already. And another one</L>
<L>That cries Melpomene, and drinks Helicon,</L>
<L>At Poetrie throws wit and wealth away,</L>
<L>And makes it all his work to write a play.</L>
<L>Nay, on Divinity many spend their powres,</L>
<L>That scarce learn any thing, but to stand two houres.</L>
<L>How must we, Sir, admire you then, that know</L>
<L>All Arts, and all the best of these can show?</L>
<L>For your deep skill in State, I cannot say,</L>
<L>My knowledge there is onely to obey:</L>
<L>But I beleeve 'tis known to our best Peeres,</L>
<L>Amaz'd to see a Nestor at your yeares.</L>
<L>Mars claims you too, witnesse the Gallion,</L>

<L>And bid his waves call you their Generall.</L>
<L>How many men might you divide your store</L>

<L>Though enrich them? Stay here. How dare I then</L>

It had been a mighty fa|vour once, to have kiss'd these lips that grin so. This mouth out of all the Madams boxes cannot now be furnished with a set of

teeth. She was the coyest overcurious dame in all the city: her chambermaids misplacing of a hair, was as much as her place came to. &mdash;Oh! if that Lady now could but behold this physnomie of hers in a looking-glasse, what a monster would she imagine her self!

<SPEAKER>Sex.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tush, dreams are idle things. There is no felonie warrant|able but ours, for it is grounded on rules of charity. Is it fitting the dead should be cloath'd, and the living go naked? Besides, what is it to them whether they lie in sheets or no? Did you ever heare of any that caught cold in his coffin? Moreover, there is safety and security in these attempts: What inhabitant of the grave that had his house broke open, accus'd the thief of Bur|glarie? Look here: This is a Lawyers skull. There was a tongue in't once, a damnable eloquent tongue, that would almost have perswaded any man to the gallows. This was a turbulent busie fellow, till death gave him his <HI>Quietus est.</HI> And yet I ven|tured to rob him of his gown, and the rest of his habillements, to the very buckrum-bag, not leaving him so much as a poore half-peny to pay for his wafrage: and yet the good man ne're re|pin'd at it. Had he been alive, and were to have pleaded against
<PB N="63" REF="40">
me, how would he have thundred it? &mdash;Behold (most grave Judges) a fact of that horrour and height in sinne, so abominable, so detestable in the eyes of heaven and earth, that never any but this dayes cause presented to the admiration of your eares. I can|not speak it without trembling, 'tis so new, so unus'd, so unheard|of a villanie! But that I know your Lordships confident of the honestie of your poore Oratour, I should not hope by all my reasons, grounds, testimonies, arguments, and perswasions to gain your belief. This man, said I man? this monster rather: but monster is too easie a name: this devil, this incarnate devil, ha|ving lost all honesty, and abjur'd the profession of vertue, Rob'd, (a sinne in the action.) But who? The dead. What need I aggravate the fault? the naming the action is sufficient to con|demne him. I say, he rob'd the dead. The dead! Had he rob'd the living, it had been more pardonable: but to rob the dead of their clothes, the poore impotent dead, that can neither card, nor spin, nor make new ones, O 'tis most audacious and intolerable! &mdash;Now you have well spoke, why do you not after all this Rhetorick, put your hand behinde you, to receive some more in|structions backward?
