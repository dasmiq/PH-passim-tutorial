<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Diversion that <HI>Collin</HI> has al|ready had the good Fortune to give your Lordship at some times of leasure, (when being retir'd from pub|lick Affairs you have honour'd me with your Conversation) makes him now presume to throw himself at your Feet, and withal, ingages me to appear in his behalf, Your Lordships most hum|ble Petitioner: The little time of his being in Town, has not at all hin|der'd him from the perfect Knowledge of your Character; that noble Nature,
<PB REF="3">
and uncommon Goodness, that gene|rally influences and obliges not only those whose Merits have qualified 'em for such an Honour; but even others whose Malice and Folly have justly deserv'd your Contempt and In|dignation; cannot be without the Ex|tremity of base and partial Ingratitude, exempted from general Applause; and amongst the rest, has likewise so charm'd the Heart and Understanding of Poor <HI>Collin,</HI> that he rather chooses to renounce the whole Body of Presbytery, by ex|posing their Frailties to promote your Mirth, than endanger the misfortune of losing that part of your Lordships Favour, which his benign Stars have already far beyond his Merit blest him with.</P>
<P>Nor am I, my Lord, tho a Petitione<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> for him, the less an humble Mediator fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> my Self: This BOOK with which present your Lordship, and which
<PB REF="3">
confess was not design'd to please all Parties, having much the greater oc|casion to make its Court to you, 'tis my Happiness to know your Lordship to be of a clear and genuine Under|standing, not sullied by the Town-Vices, of Malice, or unreasonable Criti|cism, tho capable of judging with the Wisest and most Correct, you will rather convince a Poet of his Error, by an easie Argument, than endeavour to raise the Structure of your own Wit, by crying down his, when he is out of your sight; And as your Generous In|clination to Arts, especially those of Poetry and Musick, incline you rather to favour and instruct, than detract or reprove a Professor; so 'tis impossible for the Muses to do themselves greater Justice or Honour, than to implore the Patronage of a Nobleman, so per|fectly qualified, whose Soul agrees with Science by Sympathy, and whose admirable Vertue of good Nature, in|fluences
<PB REF="4">
the Poetick Art like another. <HI>Apollo,</HI> and rather plants the Lawrel more firmly, than tears it from the Brows of any deserving Author.</P>
<P>The Satyrical Part of my Poem need not offend any one that is Wise enough not to expose himself: My Lines being (as the Eternally Famous <HI>Butler</HI> once said before,) like Sales|mens Cloths, made for them only that they will fit; and with the same limit as <HI>Iuvenal</HI> allows his Satyrs:</P>
<Q>Quicquid agunt homines, votum timor, ira, voluptas, Gaudia, discursus, nostri farrago Libelli est.</Q>
<P>Your Lordships stedfast Opinion in Favour of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> gives me hopes you will be pleas'd the more with my exposing her Enemies; the Illustrious Stock from which you have your Being, giving you daily a
<PB REF="4">
noble Example of constant Candor for our Religion, as well as tender Love for your Country; that flourishing <HI>Cedar</HI> that has already adorn'd the Garden of one of our most lov'd and greatest Mo|narchs, and now by Sacred Provi|dence transplanted into the Bosom of a second, no less affected and rever'd, do's not only appear the Courts chiefest Or|nament, but its greatest Blessing; the spreading Vigor of his fasten'd Root, will make him still defie the Storms of Malice, and stand in spight of For|tune, whilst the Indulgence of his Ge|nuin shade, nobly refreshes those un|grateful Creatures who pine to see his Height and Virdant Glory.</P>
<P>This Theme would almost draw me to a Rapture, did not a just Sense of my weak Abilities check my Presum|ption: I shall therefore descend from that lofty Tract, to beg Pardon of your Lordship for this Prolixity, and prepare <HI>Collin</HI> to entertain you with his
<PB REF="5">
Humor and Character, as also with the divertive Accidents in his several Walks, which I do assure your Lord|ship are entirely new, and I hope will afford you the satisfaction I ex|pect they should: The Wit and Style I humbly submit to your Lordships Judgment, with unusual Joy to fall in|to such noble Hands, where I am sure to have generous Usage; your uncom|mon Affability, sweet and unaffected Behaviour, and modest Treating your Inferiors, ingaging the Hearts of all that have the Honour to know you, as well as that of</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE various Sentiments and conten|tious Discourses of the People, as well of Town as Country, being the undoubted Occasion of the daily Animosities and Discon|tents that perpetually rise amongst us, was the chief reason of my publishing the following Piece of Railery; in which I would insinuate to 'em the little Benefit and Advantage they do Themselves or their Country, by entring into Politicks and Grumbling against the Government, which (in the first place) they shonld rationally believe it is improbable for them to alter; and secondly if there could be an alteration by other means, should cautiously consider what benefit either their Coun|try or themselves should reap by a second Revolu|tion so unlike to be, without the severest Distresses that Blood and Slaughter can possibly bring upon us: <HI>Euripides</HI> says, <HI>Mens una sapiens plurium vincit manus;</HI> If therefore the success of all worldly Proceedings do's shew, that Prudence makes prosperous the Event of Human Actions,
<PB REF="6">
more than Railing or Violence, then I am sure all Grumblers are at a loss every Way, for they can only talk Seditiously, without effecting any thing, which in my Opinion is no part of Wisdom: or if they should happen to do any Thing persuant to their own purpose, it would unavoidably be either a Damage to their Country or Themselves, as the best Iudgment of the Nation believes, and so consequently in the second place can never be quoted for an Act of Prudence.</P>
<P>I therefore in the following Discourses between the Major and Country <HI>Collin,</HI> have in a Method of Railery expos'd the Humors of a Grumbling Church of <HI>England-Man,</HI> and an opinionated Presbiter, taking this Burlesque manner of Writ|ing to promote the Readers Diversions in a greater measure than it could possibly be in a more solemn Stile; for I have taken Care both in <HI>Collins</HI> Cha|recter, and his Arguments to prepare a farsical Entertainment against Popery for the Brethren, and a pleasant Interlude against Phanatiscim for the Romanists, and shall be very well pleas'd if the Worthy Members of the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> will do me the Honour to sit down and Laugh at both, they having some reason to do so; as well knowing that some little time since, both the others did as much for them, with a more than ordinary Satisfaction. Tho the Characters may be thought Satyrical, yet is there no particular Re|flection upon any one; nor have I maliciously ex|pos'd any irregularity in the last Reign; or made
<PB REF="6">
any unmanner'd Remarques upon my Superiors, my sole Business being to rally my Country-Men into Union and good Humor; and to publish the Re|gard and Honour I have for the Establish'd Church, by explaining the Envy, Errors, Stubborness and Foppery of her two implacable Enemies, Popery and Presbytery.</P>
<P>There is nothing more common in this Age than Licencious Tongues, tho at the same time 'tis a receiv'd Opinion, That there is nothing more per|nicious to the Government; every Illiterate Me|chanick, that has but Stock enough to purchase a Dish of Coffee, has the Liberty, and as he thinks the Ability to judge of Politicks as well as the best of them that sit at the Helm.</P>
<P>The Generals Conduct in <HI>Ireland</HI> is good or bad as he pleases to fancy it, and the haughty Monarch of <HI>France</HI> is to be brought down, or continue in his Opulency, just as his admirable Iudgment thinks fit; 'tis from such as he the Scandalous Mint of False News is Coyn'd, which in this Town is always naturally so catching, that its infection spreads like a Tetter upon the ill blooded Vulgar; this sets the disconsolate Male|content that has lost his Employment a Swearing; the Rich Curmudgeonly Common-wealths Man, that dams his Soul for six pence, a Railing; the Subtile Bribe-taking Lawyer, whose rich Crop is lessned by loss of the Dispensing Iudges, a Braw|ling; the Stigmatiz'd Quaker, Sneaking Ana|baptist, the Incorrigible Presbyterian a Canting;
<PB REF="7">
the Squeamish Tender Conscience Parson a hope|ing, and altogether to joyn in the admirable Chorus of Grumbling.</P>
<P>The chief Cause of which disquiet, is the Times distress, occasioned by the late Revolution; and the troublesome Taxes and Impositions, which must of necessity follow so great an Affair, as the restor|ing our Church to her Ancient Priviledges and Rights; nor can any true English-Man who has any Honour in him, reasonably grudge a part of his Fortune to secure the rest, his Country and Religion, or suffer them to be again in Danger for want of some small Contributions;</P>
<LG>
<L>As if he thought she could not want</L>
<L>Aid to her Title Militant;</L>
<L>But was her Self so mighty grown,</L>
<L>To fight her Battles out alone,</L>
</LG>
<P>As our Friend <HI>Collin</HI> has it: And tho to the Common Sort, and such as are destitute of Rea|son, as well as Consideration, every Taxation and Imposition seems heavy, needless or superflu|ous; yet the more Iudicious know the Intentions of it, is to defend our Religion and Properties by a just War, and thence use the means the sooner to confirm a Peace to the People, which Peace can|not be procured without Arms, nor Arms with|out Pay, nor Pay without Impositions.</P>
<P>In the Major's Character, <HI>I</HI> have endeavoured to describe the Right Humor of a Male-content;
<PB REF="7">
he pretends to be of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but cannot allow that her Ruine should be put into the Ballance against his Interest; let her lose her Rights a Gods Name, rather than he his Office or Commission, which makes him in his first Speech to <HI>Collin</HI> spleenatickly Argue,</P>
<LG>
<L>Had it not for us better bin,</L>
<L>If th' Pope or Devil himself came in;</L>
<L>Than thus t'involve our selves in War,</L>
<L>And plunge our Souls in endless Care,</L>
<L>By needless emptying of our Purses,</L>
<L>Make all our Wives and Children Curse us;</L>
<L>And all these rowling Mischiefs gather,</L>
<L>For Conscience, yet have none on't neither?</L>
</LG>
<P>Which I think the Parties themselves will own is as natural Grumbling, as Heart could wish, or as they themselves could dictate; and if they ask me how <HI>Collin,</HI> whose Character is a Coun|try Clown, and consequently sordid and illiterate, should be so good a Disputant to oppose the Ma|jor's Reasons; they may please to observe, that I have qualified him for Discourse, by Observa|tions from his Father, who was a Divine, a great Logician and Philospher; and since it is certainly every Mans Duty, as well as every Poets to do as much as his Capacity permits him towards the Advancement of his Religion, and the Benefit of his Country, either by lessening their Enemies Reputation, or extolling the Merit of
<PB REF="8">
his own Cause, I hope every worthy and true Eng|lish Protestant of the Establish'd Church (for I have no hopes of the Outlyers) will favourably allow the following Poem, which altho may not have weight enough to improve their Under|standings, may have diversion enough pleasantly to pass away an hour or two: I confess, I dare brag much of my own true Practice of Religion; yet I design to shew in this, which 'tis I Honour, and which (whatever my Enemies suggest against me) was ever my Opinion to be the best in the World.</P>
<P>I hope also the Majority of the Natives of <HI>England,</HI> have Prudence enough to allow the same, and Honour enough to defend it against all Oppositions; for by that means they will the sooner bring all disquiet Male-contents to see their own Error, and by a general Union of Hearts and Tongues, restore their Country to that Happiness which fatal Discord, and unreasonable Grumbling at present deprives it of: I hope I may with Reason believe the Oppression our Religion receiv'd, was the only Cause of the late Revolution; and also hope the King and our Iudicious Patriots will henceforth so settle it, that it may never again be in Danger; and therefore what good, violent Animosities, or any rash Undertaker can propose to his Country or Himself, by indeavouring an al|teration, I cannot understand, nor I think any one else who prefers prosperous Peace, before un|natural Dissentions; and a Civil Community be|fore a Civil War.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">It has been a receiv'd Maxim, That who|ever have endeavoured to suppress by Violence an alteration in Government settled by the Iudgment and Concurrence of the Major, and wiser part of the People, which I hope is the Case now, have in all Ages promoted their own Ruins, with|out any success in their Undertakings. <HI>Cosmo de Medices,</HI> having gain'd an extraordinary Re|putation in <HI>Florence,</HI> the Citizens imagin'd that to suffer it to increase was dangerous, and there|fore by common consent banished him, which vio|lent Proceeding so offended the Friends of <HI>Cosmo,</HI> being it seems the stronger and wiser Party, that they afterwards forc'd his Enemies to recal him, and make him Prince of the City. The same hap|pen'd in <HI>Rome,</HI> where <HI>Caesar</HI> at first for his Virtues much admir'd and follow'd, became afterwards to be fear'd, and those that fear'd, not consider|ing their Power to be inferiour to his, endeavour|ing to supress him, were the occasion of his greater Glory. I insert these Examples only as Parallels that the Male-contents may see their own Ruine will not be only inevitable, but the Government settled the stronger by their rash Attempts, and pointless Aspersions; nor need I publish here the blessing of Union; every Mans Interest and Safety, being now best able to inform him, how extreamly necessary it is to make the best of our present Fortune, by a Dutiful Obedience to the Superiours that Heaven has set over us.</P>
<P><PB REF="9">To conclude, The rest is to desire every Cri|tick, that is pleas'd to do me the Honour to read the following Piece, to allow me as much of his good Nature as he can well spare, assuring him there is nothing in it to offend him, or any one that will pass by the same sort of Railery, that has been us'd formerly; for the better ex|plaining of which, I have at the End of the Book, written Annotations to every <HI>Canto,</HI> which tho to the Learned may be needless, may to others be useful, who design to consider Honest <HI>Collin</HI> ac|cording to his Merit, whom if I find well re|ceiv'd by the Party I intend him to divert, I will in the last three Days of my next Part, carry to <HI>Westminster-Abby</HI> to see the Tombs; to <HI>Gresham-College</HI> to admire a <HI>Virtuoso,</HI> and to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> to give him occasion by that Epitome, to make the better Remarques upon our Nation, and particularly upon his own Tribe, the Contentious and Irreconcilable (tho indefatigably Devout) Brethren.</P>

<L>So Law to which such power belongs,</L>
<L>Should be least ready to do wrongs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quoth <HI>Collin,</HI> that Law should do right</L>
<L>I think there's no one will deny't</L>
<L>That's in his Sences, and to shew</L>
<L>That I believe it doth do so,</L>
<L>I've just thought on a Neighbours case</L>
<L>That's very proper for this place,</L>

<L>Misled, and taken from his house;</L>
<L>And by a snivelling Whore-master</L>
<L>Detain'd without all Sence or fear;</L>
<L>If therefore Justice here doth sway,</L>

<L>Quoth Major, of all suits desended,</L>

<L>She's best in humour with a Fee&punc;</L>

<L>Directs his Judgment right or wrong,</L>
<L>Raises his wit and tips his Tongue,</L>
<L>And makes him fit to plead the cause,</L>
<L>And better understand the Laws;</L>
