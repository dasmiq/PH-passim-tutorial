<P>IF your serious occasions will permit me so
much honour, that this sleight Book may
bee accepted and perused, I shall justly ac|knowledge
the favour to be far above either
my hopes or merit. And if you ever vouch|safed
your Presence when it was presented on
the Stage, <HI>I</HI> am confident, your (no-way er|ring-)
Iudgments will now allow it, as it then
was intended, which was, rather to provoke
a laughter, then occasion a contemplation. It
will likewise engage my grateful service, if I
be not (in your worthie opinions) taxt of Ar|rogance,
to present my unpolished lines, when
daily those of excellence are offered to your Eies
and Ears: But in the confidence of your cle|mencie,
<HI>I</HI> submit to the verdict of my grand
Iury. And how soever you are pleased to cen|sure,
will remain (as I ought) the humblest of
your servants,</P>

enough to satisfie the insatiate gut of my son <HI>Simple|ton.</HI>
He will not work, and yet no sooner is his nose
out of the Alehouse, but his head is in the Cupboard:
His insatiate stomach may well defie a Giant, or the
great Eater of <HI>Kent;</HI> but I have thought upon a way
which he shall either take in hand, or graze with
Hobb my horse; Sirrah <HI>Simpleton,</HI> where are you?</P>

Nymph <HI>Oenone</HI> makes much of me, and lets all the
other Shepherds shake their ears like Asses; And the
truth is, if <HI>I</HI> can find never a handsomer she shall serve
the turn. This was her birth-day, she being born in the
year&mdash;one thousand six hundred,&mdash;nay hold a
little; but on this day of the month it was, Winter or
Summer, in the honour of which we all keep holiday;
and therefore for the credit of her beauty, and the honor
of my own Poetry, have made such a Copie of Verses
on her, as will make her a thousand times handsomer

and needs would make me Judge of his abuse.&mdash;
I have (sayes he) about some two years since, married
a wife, (wo worth the time I saw her) and in my ab|sence
