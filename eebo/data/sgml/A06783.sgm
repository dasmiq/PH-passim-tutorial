<P>_OUre Lorde and alone

declareth in a parable
of the gospell, that af|ter
a certayne houshoulder had
sowed good seede in hys fielde,
whyle hys seruauntes slepte, hys
ennemye came and sowed tares
amonge the wheate and wente
hys waye, Thys houshoulder is
Christ the lord. The good sede is
y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> children of god &amp; gods worde.
<PB REF="3">
The seruauntes that slepte are
negligente Prelates and sleepye
shepheardes, whiche watche not

is the deuil. The tares are the
children of the wicked, &amp; errours
and heresies, which? Satan sow+eth
in the heartes, of the vnbele|uinge.

the gratest occasion wherin Sa|tan

<PB REF="4">
whiche maye moue him to do

Howe many kynde of Heretikes

What greate and howe manye

of the primatiue church w^t 
the heretikes of theyr time for the

for plucking vp y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> enemies tares?
Since the time y^t those verteous

god be deuided? The number of
<PB REF="5">
sectes and counterfait religious,
which yet liue vnder the Bishop
of Rome, are almoste innumera|ble.
Neither ceaseth Sathan eue~
in this most clear light of the gos+pel
to play the right deuil, and to
cast mistes before the eies of the
vnfaithful. Into how many sects
is Christendome yet deuided? Ar
not some called papists, some pro+testants,
some Anabaptists, some
sacramentaries? Whence come
al these abhominacions but only
from sathan the author of al euil?
Moreouer in what fielde, where
good sede hath bene sowed, hath
not the ennemie sowed his tares
also? howe pestilentlye hathe he

and almes deede, howe hathe
he made the~ to be abused? There
is no pointe of Christen religion,
which Sathan hath not attemp|ted
too ouerthrowe by hys mini|sters.
And albeit as I said before
the enemy laboureth at all times
to sowe hys tares in the Lordes
fielde, yet when the shepheardes
of Christes flocke be neglige~t in
doing their dutye, fal a slepe and
loke not to the Lordes field, then
doth he most of al play his parte
and bestoure him like a right de|uil,
