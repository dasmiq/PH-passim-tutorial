<HEAD>To the Christian Reader / grace and peace from God our Fa|ther and Iesus Christ our Lord.</HEAD>
<P>_BEcause Prayer vnto God is a most Christian exercise and fruit of faith / being rightly vsed: having so many commaundements and promises concerning it in the Scripture: by which we come most neare vnto God / as in any other part of his worship / speaking to him (as it were) mouth to mouth / when we lift vp our hearts and powre forth our requests vnto the Lord: it was thougt needfull / seing these latter Treatises of Mr. Greenwoods towching this Argume~t are now published agayne / a~d his first concerning it can|not be had / here therefore to note downe briefly a few things both co~|cerning the doctrine a~d right vse of praier: a~d in particular concerning read prayer / by meanes whereof it is come to passe that true praier is so much vnknowe~ / neglected / a~d profaned. And this we pray thee (Chri+stian Reader) to take in good part / and to examine vp the word of God / which is the onely rule of truth / and light of our feet in the darknes of this World.</P>
<P>Prayer is the lifting vp off the heart vnto God / to call vpon his na|me / with faith / by the work and help of his Spirit. Psal. 25.1. Rom. 10 1;.14. Mat. 21.22. Rom. 8.26.27.</P>
<P>Praier is eyther with words / or without words. With words / being vttered in speach / eyther publickly or privately: eyther in mo or fewer words: yet alway briefly: according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the present and severall occasio~s. Exod. 32.11.12.13. Ezra. 9.6.15 / 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am. 7.18.29. and 15.31. Mat. 26.39 Ioh. 17. chap. Act. 1.24.25. and 4.24.30. Heb. 13.15.</P>
<P>Without words / being conceyved onely in the mynd / and so presented before the Lord who knoweth the thoughts and secrets of the heart. Exod. 14.15 / <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Sam. 1.12.13. Esa. 38.14.</P>
<P>Prayer is eyther Request or Thankesgiving. Both these are eyther for our selves / or for others. Request for our selves / is deprecatio~ or sup+plication: for others / intercession. 1. Tim. 2.1.</P>
<P>Deprecation is for some evill to be kept or removed by the Lord fro~ vs. Mat. 6.13. and 8.24.25. Psal. 70. Gen. 32.9.12 / 2. Cor. 12.8. Ia~. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.13.</P>
<P>Supplication is for some good thing to be graunted or co~tinewed of God vnto vs. Mat. 6.9.12. Gen. 24.12. Exod. 33.12.13. Psal. 4.6. Luk. 11.13. and 17.5.</P>
<P>Intercession is for others / eyther for some good to be given / or some evill to be taken from them. Mat. 6.9.11.12. and 5.44. Exod. 32.11.12. 13. Ephes. 6.18.19.20. Rom. 15.30.31.32. Iam. 5.14.18 / 1. Ioh. 5.16.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">Thankesgiving is the yeelding of praise and tha~ks vnto God for his mercy and benefits eyther given or promised. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9.13. Gen. 24.27. Exo. 15.1.21. Psa. 69.29.36. a~d 103.1.5: Ioh. 11.41. 1. Tim. 1.17. Re. 7.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>Prayer is to be made alwayes and onely in the Mediation of Christ. Ioh. 14.13.14.1. Tim. 2.5. Not that this need alway to be mentioned / but that we ought alway to come before God and present our selves / and our prayers vnto him with faith in the Mediation of Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by whom alone / we and al our sacrifices are made acceptable vnto God. For in him are all the promises of God yea and Amen. 2. Cor. 1.20. Through him are all the graces a~d mercyes of God conveyed vnto vs Ioh. 1.16. Ephes. 4.7. By his Mediatio~ our prayers being presented be|fore his Father / all the weaknes / want of faith love hope / a~d any other corruption wherewith our prayers (as they proceed from vs) be distey+ned / are covered and taken away. Because he putteth the sweet odour of his Mediation vnto our prayers / and so presenting them to his Fa|ther / they are accepted of him. Rev. 8.3.4. with Exod. 30.7.8. Psal. 141.2 Mar. 9.22.23.24 / 1. Pet. 2.5.</P>
<P>For this cause therefore / must prayer / in faith / alway respect Gods promise / and Christs Mediation. Mar. 11.24. Psal. 50.15. Rom. 8.34. Heb: 7.25. and 9.24. And for the same cause / must the person that pray|eth first be accepted of God in Christ / before their prayers and sacrifi|ces can be approved. Rev. 1.5.6 / 1. Pet. 2.5. Prov. 15.8, Hag. 2.13.14.15. Gen. 4.3.4.5. and 6.8. and 8.20.21. with Heb. 11.4.7. Wherevpon we are bound to be carefull / first our selves to be in the true faith and Church of Christ / vnder his Mediation / that we may our selves be accepted of the Father in him: and then in faith to offer our prayers / both for mat|ter and maner / so as we have warrant by the word of God / that he wil heare vs / a~d that Christ will be our Mediatour / therein. For which see the Scriptures a foresaid: and Mat. 6.9 Ephes. 2.19. and 4.4.5.6. Act. 2.41.47. Exo. 30.9. Levi. 17.3.7. Deut. 12.5.8. Psal. 16.4. and 50.8.14.16 17.23. Esa. 1.12. etc. Mal. 1.14 / 1. Tim. 2.1.2.5.8. Iam. 1.5.8. Iohn 5. 13.14. Rev. 8.3.4.</P>
<P>For our better direction and assurance herein / hath Christ give~ that forme of prayer / which is commonly called the Lords prayer. Mat. 6. 9.13. Luk. 14.1.2.3.4. Where he hath prescribed a direction for the fra|ming of all our prayers both for matter and maner according to that rule. For in it we are taught / as towching the matter of all our pray|ers / that they be for things first and chiefly concerning Gods glory / and then concerning our good / so as will stand with the glory of God. Ioh. 12.27.28. And towching the maner of prayer / that it be in faith hope and love / with reverence / briefly and humbly propounded / that he in al may be glorifyed. In faith (I say) both of Gods willingnes to heare a~d help / as being our Father in Christ / a~d of his ability therevnto as being in heaven able to do whatsoever he will. Esa. 63.16. Psal. 115.3. In ho|pe / of his mercy and favour towards vs / he being our Father and we his children in Christ. Luc. 11.9.13. In love both off God and one off
<PB REF="3">
another / in Christ. Psa. 116.1. Mar. 11.25.26. Act. 4.24. With revere~ce / as coming before our heavenly Father / who is full off glory and Ma|jesty / he in heaven / we on earth etc. And therefore also ought our pray|ers briefly and hunbly to be propounded: not seking after long or affec|ted speach / nor vsing vayne repetitions etc. Mat. 6.7.8.9. Genes. 18.27. Exood. 34.8.9. Ecclesiast. 5.1.</P>
<P>And note here / that Christ hath propounded this direction / not by way off exhortation or doctrine / as in other cases he was woont / but in forme off petitions / and those very brieff: Least otherwise we should have doubted that we might not with such confidence in few words have spoken directly vnto God himselff: but that we must have vsed ei|ther mediatours for vs / as the Papists / or sighs onely without words as the Anabaptists / or never ceasing from prayer / as the Eutychians / or at least some long circu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sta~ce off words a~d great affectatio~ of speach or the like / as ignorance / superstition / and hypocrisy are ready to lead vnto.</P>
<P>Finally / in this forme off prayer / by Christ we are taught / that the end and scope off all our prayers / ought to be the glory God in Christ. And that therefore we pray alway / with submission off our selves and our requests vnto his will / who being King and Lord ouer all / know|eth and will performe what he seeth best for his glory and our good. Mat. 6.13.</P>
<P>And thus prayer conceyved or vttered in five words / is better then ten thousand otherwise / as the Apostle speaketh of prayer in another case / 1. Cor. 14.19.</P>
<P>Now the help which God hath promised a~d giueth vnto vs in praier is his Spirit. Which is as the fyer / quickning and stirring vp our spi|rit to and in prayer: given of God vnto vs for the helping off our infir|mityes / that we by it in faith should call vpon the Lord our Father in Christ: Rom. 8.26.27. Gal. 4.6. with Exod. 30.7.8. And this fitly agreeth with the nature of God / who as he is a Spirit in himselff / so wil he off vs be worshipped in Spirit and truth. Ioh. 4.24. Ephes. 6.18.</P>
<P>Other helps as off praying vpo~ a book / or of beads / or the like / read we not any appointed by God. Many tymes in deed we read in the Scripture off the prayers off the faithfull made to the Lord / but never off any one that read their prayers vpon a book or reckned them vpon beads etc. And no marvell / seing the Lord did never eyther commaund to vse / or promise to accept such service off him. Therefore must it needs be / that book prayers / etc. are an invention off man / and a vayne worship off GOD. Exod. 20.4.5.6. Esaie 29.13. Matthe. 15.9.</P>
<P>Neyther can this stand with the nature and dutyes off prayer / befo|re mentioned: But in deed breedeth and nourisheth both ignorance and neglect off true prayer / as by lamentable experience may be seen.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">But into this poynt we will not now further enter / seing it is sufficie~t|ly handled in these Treatises which were purposely written concer|ning it. Onely because Mr. Henry Barrow (who was Mr. Gree~woods
fellow prisoner and fellow Martyr) hath also written of this point / and namely co~cerning the book of co~mo~ prayer particularly in some books of his / which now are scant to be gotten / we thought it good likewise / from thence to annex these few lynes following co~cerning it.

<P>My first writing being about that spiritual exercise of praier and true inuocacion of Gods reuerend name, where|by the distressed soule of man, loaden with the burden of sinne, compassed also about with so many deceitfull enimies, contynual assaults of Sa|tan, rebellion of the flesh, entisements of the world etc. seeketh daylie help of God the Father, giuer of all good giftes, hauing thorough. <HI>IESVS CHRIST</HI> free accesse by the direction of his holy spirit, for all occasions to vnburden yt self of whatsoeuer grief, or occasion of thankes yt is moued with: I ought still&punc; and by Gods assistance shall keepe me in the meeknes of the spirit, not witstanding his vnchristian railinges, sclanders, and re|proches against me and the truth. I then shewed that no other prayer could vtter and ease the seuerall occasions and distresses of this conscience&punc; and that no other mans writing could speake for this soule vnto God, but the heart and mouth of him that prayeth for himself, or is chosen the mouth of many, vttering to God his or ther mindes for their present wantes or occasions of thanckes giuing, according to the will of God, as neede and occasion vrgeth, and the spirit giueth vtterance. And I furder proved that onlie this prayer pleaseth God, and is grounded of faith; to this effect I brought many reasons out of Gods worde, admiring the ig|norance of this age, wherin (hauing had the gospell of Christ thus manie yeares in our owne language to search and try al things by) whole congre|gations do make no other prayer to God then reading ouer certeine num|bers of wordes vpon a booke from yeare to yeare, moneth to moneth, day to day <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the same matter and words as they were stinted, euen out of that <HI>Port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is,</HI> englished out of Antichrists masse-booke; besides priuate rea|ding of mens writings instead of praying. And seing this counterfeit shew of worship and pretended prayers was made common marchandize in euery assemblie by this Antichristian priesthood, and that al men euery where were compelled to bowe downe herevnto, and to offer by such coun|terfeit sacrifices; I perceaved the first principle of Religion (which is to inuocate the name of the true God, through the meditation of Christ in spirit and truth, with heart and voyce, for our present wantes according to the wil of God) was never yet sincearly taught by these time-seruing

Priests: But as an agreeable service to the humors of earthlie minded men which haue not the spirit of God, this ware was thrust vpo~ al people, they well knowing, that such a ministerie and such a Church of wordlings could neuer haue stood, without such a Samaritan worshipp and E|giptian calf; and like earthlie deuised to counterfeyt a Religion, al men in|clyned to some. And long have I heard this pretended worship inveyed against by many (sometymes zealous) for the errours and confused or|der therof: Yet could I not heare anie to sett downe or teach, which was the true prayer that only pleased God, manie contriving divers formes of wordes, as though they had knowen the heart of man, counselled them to reade them, day vnto day, yeare vnto yeare, at evening, morning, dinner, Svpper <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by portion, measure, and stint, as an offering to God what state soever the soule were in; not teaching the difference betweene reading vpon a booke, and prayer vnto God, all this tyme. So that true and only prayer hath not beene taught al this tyme, and those that knewe how to pray aright neglect it, this reading being most easie as they thinke, and they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">test therunto, compelled in the publique assemblies thus to mocke with God, after the manner of the papists mattins, true zeale no where founde, but in the persequted remnant.</P>

<P>To condemne and ouerthrow read prayer, ye bring as the ground or founda|tion of all your matter, this Sentence, GOD is a Spirit and to be vvorshipped in Spirit. Iohn. 4. This Scripture in deede is cleare and strong to cut downe al Car|nal worship, as disgreeing from the nature of GOD. And if any mayntaine that the very bodily action of reading is the worship of God, it may fitly be alleadged against them, &amp;c.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>IOHN GREENWOODS ANSWER. Wisdome is Iustified of her Children.</HEAD>
<P>IT is agreed vpon and consented vnto on both sides, that seeing God is a spirit, and onely requireth such to worship him, as worship him in spirit and truth: all carnall worship is cut downe hereby, of what sort soeuer, as disagreeing from the nature of God: And that all fantastical deuises of men; namely, whatsoeuer is not warranted in his worde, is car|nall worship, a wearisomnes vnto him, and lothsome in his sight: So that no man ought to intermedle, attempt, or practize anie thing in shew of worship whereof they haue not sure grounde of his worde: For euen our God is a consuming fire.</P>
<P>Now to put away all your (<HI>bodily</HI>) distinctions and earthly cauils, I still affirme (as I haue proued) the stinting, imposing mens writings vp|on publique assemblies, to haue them read ouer by number and stint, or any other way, as a worship of God in stead of true inuocation, is a meere deuise of man, and so carnall worship; as also all other reading of mens writinges publiquely or priuatly in this abuse, for praying to God. Yet say you <HI>to apply this Scripture Iohn.</HI> 4.22.23 <HI>in this manner against read pray|er, is friuolous,</HI> where I appeale to all mens consciences, for the weight therof. It is friuolous, you say, <HI>except I can proue that a man cannot pray by the spirit of GOD with sighes and groanes vpon a booke, or when prayer is vttered after a prescript forme &amp;c.</HI> At the first step you go about to alter the question. All our prayers ought to be vttered after a prescript forme, euen that perfect rule and forme our Sauiour gaue to his Disciples and al po|ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ities: But this is nothing to the matter.</P>
<P>For the other which is nothing but a begging of the question. I allea|ged certayne reasons to this effecet. First that those sighes and groanes in reading instead of praying were not of fayth, seeing in praying the sighes and groanes that proceede of faith, minister matter to praye without a booke. Secondly that you did but barely affirme the question in calling it prayer by the spirit when one doth read, seing reading is not praying at al: for as I then alleadged, to inuocate the name of God in spirit, is by the worke of the spirit to bring fourth of our hearts praier to God, which is than in truth when yt agreeth to Gods word. But reading is another mat|ter, namely a receauing of instruccion into the heart from the booke. Out
<PB N="8" REF="10">
of the first <HI>Mr. GIFFORD</HI> maketh men beleeue he hath fetched two he|resies; the one <HI>a perfection of faith,</HI> the other <HI>that faith cannot be ioyned vnto, or stand vvith anie outvvard helpes for the encrease therof.</HI> Litle mar|ueile, he found so m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nie heresies in our whole writinges, that could finde two or three in my first reason: but that you may remember your self bet|ter (though you had two yeares to consider) I will bring the wordes before you againe, if peradventure you may have grace to call backe yourself. I said if the sighes and groanes (in that kinde of praying) were of faith, yt would, minister matter without a booke: this sentence I may confirme by manie testimonies of scripture, that no peruerted spirit can gainesay or resist: the scripture teacheth vs euery where, <HI>that in praying the spirit on|lie helpeth our infirmities,</HI> no other helpes mentioned or can be collected in the present action of prayer through the Scripture. <HI>He hath sent into our hearts the spirit of his Sonne crying:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.6. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.13.</NOTE> <HI>ABBA Father. vve beleeue, therfore vve speake.</HI> Yet here is not anie shew of perfectio~ of faith, but of the contra|ry, praying for our wantes. But this may be gathered, that God onely accepteth the fruits of his owne spirit in prayer, and requireth no more of anie, but that euerie one according to the proportion of faith, pray vn|to him, as occasion in them requireth. Nowe to conclude that because in praying we neede not a booke to speake for vs, when the heart it self and booke of our Conscience speaketh with God; that therefore fayth neuer nee|deth instruction, but is perfect, were sclanderous, false, and senselesse. The cause then of these heresies proceed hereof, that your selfe <HI>Mr. GIFFORD</HI> would needes frame two <HI>syllogismes,</HI> and in the moodes of your malice, co~|straine the proposition of the present action in praying, to a general sentence of all times and actions, though both our question here was of the verie action of praying, and in the conclusion of that very poynt within six lynes after this, you had these wordes; <HI>Euen in the time of their begging at Gods hands</HI>; so that these heresies must be <HI>Mr. Giffords</HI> and not myne, seeing they are found to be coyned of his idle brayne, and godles heart, only to defame the trueth.</P>
<P>But (say you) <HI>the most part are ignorant, weake, short of memorie, &amp;c. therefore need al helps to stir them vp to pray, &amp;c.</HI> where, by your own con|fession, reading is not praying, but a help to stir vp to pray. And euen here|upon all our errours arise, that you cannot discerne the difference of spiri|tuall gifts, with the distinct vse of them. We doubt not but before prayer, and all the dayes of our life we haue neede of helps of instruction to praye aright, and for the fitnes of the mind and bodie, often fasting, reading, me|ditating, etc. are great helpes to go before to humble our selues in praying: but in the present action of prayer when the heart is talking with God, the eyes, hands, etc. with attention lift vp to heaue~, al the powers of our soules and bodies conuersant with God, to take a booke and read cannot be cal|led in this action a help, but a confounding of the mind, of Gods ordinan|ces, and a doing we know not what, though before and after, it be an excel|lent meanes ordeyned of God, to instruct vs to pray and al other dueties.</P>
<P>As for <HI>the confirmation you talke of,</HI> where I alleadged that a troubled
<PB N="9" REF="10" MS="y">
minde is the penne of a readie writer / therfore needeth not a booke to spea+ke for yt in the action of praying: By troubled minde i vnderstood such a minde / as is prese~tly moued with the sight of some sinne / or vrged by other occasion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 17.</NOTE> <HI>a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart</HI>: a~d not such a minde as in dispayre or doubt ys perplexed: and that the heart which is moued in faith with present occasion to call vpon God is the penne of a readie writer / (that is) hath matter a~d wordes enough without a booc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to vtter yt owne wantes / we may reade throughout the <HI>Psalmes. My throte is dry (saith Da|vid) I am vvearie with crying &amp;c.</HI> But here againe instead of answere / you tell me / <HI>I runne vppon the rocke of an hereticall opinio~ of perfection</HI>: Wherin i wonder (but that i perceaue your right eye is blinded) you should be so ca|relesse what you say / nay what after two yeares studie you put in prynt. Doth it follow / that because the heart / moued with occasion through the worke of faith hath wordes and matter enough in praying without a boo|ke to speake for yt / that therfore faith is perfect? let equal Iudges co~sider.</P>
<P>Here you say <HI>manie are so troubled &amp; perplexed in minde, that they cannot pray till they haue some consolation by the direction of others; which whe~ they cannot haue, reading vpon a booke is a notable help,</HI> I allowe al this and agree / if you would make reading one thing / and prayer an other / divers exercises of the spirit etc. But in the verie action of praying to haue an o|ther speake vnto vs never so good wordes of exhortation / were but a con|founding of the minde and actio~ / and an abuse of both those holie exercises. Euen so / by your owne comparison / reading vpon a booke in the action of praying / seing we cannot do both at once. Yt is the Spirit of God in the verie action of prayer that helpeth our infirmities. David in praying fin|ding his soule heauie / stirreth vp himself thus. <HI>My soule whie art thou cast downe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ende 43</NOTE> <HI>whie art thou disquieted within me, waite on God; For I will yet giue him tha~kes, my prese~t help and my God.</HI> He had a troubled minde / his mouth wanted no wordes to prouoke the Lorde to heare his complaint / and his heart to waite vpon the Lorde / and so through all the Psalmes you shall finde the conversing of the soule with God to be such / as yt were a moc|kery to think reading vpon a booke could haue anie place in that ac|tion / or that anie mans writing could lay out the present estate of the soule with the passions therof. The Priest may say / <HI>my booke whie art thou so euill prynted,</HI> for whe~ they reade the heart ca~not reaso~ and talke with God.</P>
<P>To the second poynt / which was but your bare assuming of the questi|on / <HI>to say a man may pray by the spirit vpon a booke &amp;c.</HI> I alleadged that to worship God in spirit / is / when the inward faith of the heart bringeth fourth true invocation / etc. this you graunt to be most true / and that none other is accepted of GOD / then that which procee|deth from the inward faith of our owne heart: But you think that reading vpon a booke is to bring fourth of the heart true inuocatio~. This cannot be if we consider the difference betweene <HI>proseuche</HI> and <HI>anagnosis</HI> prayer and reading / the one being a powring fourth of vowes / petitions / supplications / the other a receaving into the soule of such things as we reade. This therfore i leaue to all mens consciences to be considered / whe|ther
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the matter we reade can be said a powring fourt of the heart / the whole vse of those divers actions through the whole Bible shew yt can|not. Now where I said that you teach men insteade of powring fourth their hearts / to help them selves with matter and wordes out of a booke / you say I speake fondlie and foolishlie / etc. Mine answeare now is / yt is well I lyed not / if I had said you compell men to reade vpon a booke in all your publique assemblies / certaine wordes of your owne writings by number and stint / from yeare to yeare / and day to day the same / instead of powring out their hearts before the Lorde for their present wa~ts. I had not lyed. Now let all men by that which hath bene said consider the gross|nes of yt / and so the follie remayneth to your self. But to help this matter / and to deliuer your self conningly in such strayte / you sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you wish all men to vse the help of the booke&punc; that they migt the better powre fourth their hearts vnto God / being such as are not throughly able. First you graunt here / the prayers read vpon the booke is not the powring fourth of the heart / but ought to be vsed only as an help wherbie you graunt the who|le question / and furder all your assemblies haue had no other invocation of Gods name this many yeares / but a help to teach the~ to powre fourth their hearts. But whether mens writings may be read in the publique assemblies to this vse / we shall after make manifest / Here yt is graunted but an help / and not the powring fourth of the heart. And to whom is yt an help? to such as are notable to pray. Here eyther you must confesse your whole ministerie is vnable to pray / or that they transgresse in this high worship of GOD: for in an other place you graunt in all your as|semblies this reading is vsed of mens writings for prayer / thus you may behold your best worship to be nothingh but a help to teach you to pray.</P>
<P>Where I said that you teach men to fetch the cause of their sorrowing from the booke / euen in their tyme of begging at GODS hand / you say I speake fondly to call that the cause / which is the manifestacion of the cause etc. You here forget your artes / Is ther no more cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es then one? if yt be the instrumentall cause / it is sufficient to prove / that if your Mini|nisters had not their booke / they had nothing to aske / or els asking that which is in the booke / they aske not that wich before was in their owne heartes / so not comming heauie loaden / they goe emptie away / and leave the matter in the booke as they founde yt / till the next day / and then sing the same songe. But true prayer is / when the heart is first prepared / and moued with the sight of their wants as the child that asketh breade: So we should not pray of custome / but aske the verie thing wherof our heart feeleth the want<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et. Your comparison againe betwixt the being stirred vp by a Sermon / and stirred vp by reading sheweth / that your self will not make the reading the powring fourth of the heart.</P>
<P>Ther is no question but the exercise of reading is chieflie for instructio~ and encrease of knowledge / and meditating is not the same / nether can be said to be al the vse of reading / though we denie reading to be praying: but because we are forbidden conte~tion about wordes / and I have offred you

as much wrong in saying you denyed reading to be for meditation at all / I will proceede to the more necessarie doctrines. Also for the controversie of Canonicall and Apocryphall / we shall speak in due place.</P>
<P><HI>Thus (say you) you have answered nothing at all vnto this Commandement giuen by our saviour Christ to vse that prescript forme of prayer, say, Our Fa|ther &amp;c. but by shift &amp; cauill &amp;c.</HI> Here you thinke you haue put me to a plunge / your self needed nothing doubt / but that I allowed the Co~maun|dement holie and good / and to extend to al Christians / as well as to the A|postles / namely / to vse that prescript forme of prayer as the perfect pat|terne and direction to all mens true prayers. But you I trust will make difference betwixt a forme to all prayers / and praying / or prayer. And he|re you vehemently vrge me to answeare you / before I see you conclude any thing fro~ the place / and so I should runne into follie / to answeare a mat|ter before I heare yt. In your first entrance of this discourse / you were rounde in your <HI>Syllogismes,</HI> by two at once to wrast my wordes / and can find none for yourself / Yt seemes your conscience is witnes the matter would not hang togeather. And me thinkes you had never more neede to haue shewed what you would drawe from this place Luke 11. seing I ei|ther mistooke you last time / or els you make a simple collectio~: which was this: <HI>Christ said to his Disciples, when you pray say Our Father. &amp;c. and not when you meditate say Our Father.</HI> Now what would you conclude of this / except as I said that Christ would not haue them meditate that Scrip|ture: But this I perceaue was not your meaninge: now I partlie thinke your Argument should be (if the sworde were not broke~ in the sheath) thus&punc; <HI>Christ commaunded his Disciples when they prayde to say Our Father, &amp;c. therfore to be tyed to reade ouer or say by roate certeine wordes, is law full pra|ying.</HI> For the first / that our Sauiour Christ tyed no man or commaunded none to say ouer those verie wordes when they prayde / but to pray accor|ding to that forme / after that maner as Matth. 6. I manifested in my first writing 1. that our Sauiour did not commaunde vs to vse those wordes. 2 that Matth. 6. doth not keepe the same wordes / nor that number of wor|des which Luke 11. doth 3. that he did not say / read these wordes when you pray / or say these wordes by roate. After all which reaso~s slilye passed away in both your answeres / you come with your bare affirmation / that he commaunded those wordes to be said ouer by roate or reading: yea a litle after you say / it is false to say that he commaunded not the verie wor|des to be said ouer when we pray. And you furder conclude / that because Christ commaunded his Disciples to say ouer those wordes / therfore all mens writings in the forme of praier may be brought into the publique as|semblies to be read for praier / being agreable to the worde. To which I a~swere that seing no ma~s writings are without error / yt is pernitious and blasphemous doctrine you collect. First because you make mens writings of equal autority with the forme of praier which Christ hath prescribed 2 for that you gyue me~ as much liberty and authority to frame and impose their <HI>Liturgies</HI> as Christ had to set downe a forme of praier / he being Lord of the house.

<P>Here I must call all men that reade this fruictlesse discourse to be wit|nes of Mr. Giffords abuse of his tongue / to the defacing of Gods truth. In his Epistle he proclaymed / <HI>that I called all men Idolaters</HI>; which you shall perceaue to be his owne wordes / and to that end I will breifly re|peat yt. In my first writing I affirmed the reading imposed <HI>Liturgies</HI> by stint a~d limitation instead of true invocation / as also all reading me~s wri|tings for praying / to be idolatrye. In his answeare he said / <HI>he could not see by what collour yt could be called Idolatrie, or maintayned out of Gods worde so to be; but yt seemes the penners of these things take euery sinne a|gainst the first table of the lawe, to be Idolatry: if they do so (saith he) and with all do hold that no Idolater shalbe saued, then doubtlesse all are lost, &amp;c.</HI> To|this ignora~t excursorie I answered / that all false and devised worship by mans inuention was Idolatrye / as the first and second commandemens
<PB N="13" REF="12">
did testifie: And so admit all the breaches of the first table were not idola|trye / yet reading of mens writinges instead of praying must needes be ido+latry / seing yt is a transgression of the second Commandement. Furder (though I needed not have followed his emptye head / euen a cloude wit|hout water) yet I proceeded to proue / that no idolater could be saved but by repentance for their knowne sinne / and craving pardon with David for their hidden sinnes and secreat faults.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm 119</NOTE> Moreouer (said I) do you thinke anie man is free from all inward and outward idolatrye / seing we cannot keep one Commaundement / and in some things we sinne all. In which wordes i plainelie reproued his grossnes that concluded all men idolaters which committed any idolatrye / and that no idolater could be sauld / and distinguished betweene the sinne of ignorance / weaknes / and inperfection etc. in Gods children / and open professed obstinate idolatrie. Yet this god|les man would lay to my chardg / that i should call all me~ idolaters / whe|ras i neuer vsed such a worde in all my writings / But only answered his folly in this running out from the question / they were his owne wordes that brought this vpon his owne heade / by concluding / that if euery sinne against the first table were idolatrie / and no idolater could be saued / then all are lost / let the grosnes then be his and not mine. And i leaue it to the consideration of all men / whether i may not say / that they which tra~sgres|se the first or second Commaundements / do commit Idolatrie / without absurdity. But saith he though yt be so / yet the Scripture calleth not the godly / murtherers / Idolaters / etc. for the reliques of sinne remayning.

<P>But to auoyde this foyle / he hath an other euasion. I thought (saith he) we had reasoned about such grosse idolatrie as a Church is to be conde~ned and forsaken / which is defiled therwith. Here againe you misreport me: I neuer reasoned to that end in this whole discourse / but only laboured to shew all men this error of reading me~s writinges instead of praying / that they might learne how to conuerse with God and their owne Conscience / in prayer. And what mendes wil you make for this sclandering and defa|cing of the truth / to all the world? all that I desire is your repentance and amendement / which God graunt vnto you if you you be his.</P>
<P>It followeth in your booke thus: <HI>But seeing you confess tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all men be Idolaters, that is touching the remanents of sinne, it must needs follow there is no Church free from spots, &amp;c.</HI> This worde idolaters must still be yours and then i willinglie graunt / that no man liuing is free from idolatrie / concer|ning the reliques of sinne: Also that no Church vpon earth can be without spot vpon earth: So that now / by your owne co~fessio~ / I pleade not for per|fection in this life / though the more we want / the more we ought to ende|uour. With what face then could you publish me an Anabaptist in your Epistle / and out of one mouth giue contrarie sentence? Doth your ordina|ry teach you to cast out such bitter waters of vntruthes? was yt possible I should hold al men Idolatres / and some men without committing of sinne after regeneration / especially to mainetaine both such heresies as you gy|ve

you would oppose the worde <HI>Apocrypha</HI> against the liuely voyce of Gods graces when you see I said onlie / that no <HI>Apocrypha</HI> might be brought into the publique assemblies.

<P>Where then in way of answere to the <HI>Minor Proposition,</HI> you say you see not how our speach vnto God should be <HI>Apocrypha</HI>: It answeareth not me / who deny an other mans writing to be our speach in prayer vnto God But conuinceth your self by your owne mouth / thus: True prayer ys not <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> but all mens writings are <HI>Apocrypha</HI>; Therfore me~s writings is not true prayer.

I do acco~pt the reading of the~ for praying / to be a grosse and super+stitious abuse of the~ / yet the~ to be holie and canonical Scripture. And here you haue flatly ouerthrowe~ your self: saying the worde <HI>Apocrypha</HI> is vsed with vs for that which is not Gods vndoubted worde vnto vs: And in your last writing / which should have beene your answere / you said / God speaketh to vs only by the Canonicall Scriptures.

<Q><P>Only the Canonicall Scriptures &amp; liuely voice of Gods owne graces are to be brought into the publique assemblies for doctrine &amp; prayer.</P>

I answer I haue never heard that Ihon Baptist taught his Disciples to say ouer certeyne wordes / nether can yt be gathered by our Sauiour Christes answere: for he answeared not alwaies their verie demaunde according to their wordes / but thervpon tooke occasio~ to instruct them as he sawe neede. And I haue proued by the 6. of Math. that our Saui|our did not commaunde them to say ouer the very wordes when they prayd; for the word Houtos in Mathew signifieth after this maner: A|gaine that Math. recordeth not the very number / or the very same wor+des that Luke doth. And now I reason thus: if Christ had commaunded those very wordes to be said ouer in praying / then we must alwaies whe~ we pray / say ouer those wordes: for in Math. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. he saith when you pray / pray thus / Our Father etc. The word when sheweth / that this com|maundement is to be observed at all tymes: And then the Apostles sin|ned in praying other wordes Acts. 4.24.25.

How much more then / by imposing stinted wordes to be read in the whole assemblies insteade of the liuely graces / making yt a sufficient ministe|rie to reade ouer such beggarlie ware / do you abondon Gods spirituall giftes / and make an assemblie of Atheists in most places of this land / yea in the best assemblies you compell such ware to be read / when and where the liuely voyces of Gods present graces should only he drawe~ fourth as an holie odour vnto the Lorde.

<P N="2">2.

<P>Thirdly the reading praier can be at no hand a striuing in praier / for the worde <HI>agoniso</HI> which is read Rom. 15.30. signifieth to conte~d in fer|uency both in minde and worde / to preuaile with God as <HI>Iaakob</HI> wrest|led with the Angell / and said / I will not let thee go except thou blesse me.

But if you had looked vpo~ the text better / you should see / that the Apostle in his owne person tea|cheth what ought to be donne in all Churches and of all men / And that he there taketh away the abuse of spirituall giftes 1 Corin. 14.15. and in the same Chapter sheweth that this and all other his doctrines are co~|maundements of God. vers. 37. nowe either God prescribeth two wa|yes to pray / or els your reading for praying is a devise of ma~.

<PB N="27" REF="19" MS="y">
reading prayer vpon a booke is not praying / but an instruction of the heart to praye. If you would stand to this / we should not neede haue so much labour / and all the places of Scripture which you haue alleadged for to proue reading praying / haue beene meerly wrested by you to de|ceaue the simple. Wel (say you) but if the heart be first instructed before yt can vtter matter in prayer / whie may not the heart againe be moued with hearing or reading the worde / and so vtter prayer. Yes I graunt / and still you graunt me / that reading is not praying but moueth to pra+yer: Then all your assemblies that haue no prayer but reading praiers / haue no prayer at all / a~d all that vse read praier for praying do not pra|ye but mocke with God. See if your Ordinarie will here be pleased with you: Yet you would denie all this with the same breath by a shifte / saying: The heart is moued whe~ one heareth the prayer of the minister and presently sendeth fourth prayers togeather with him. I trust you will not say that the heart of the hearer prayeth one thing / and the Mi|nister an other / againe the prayer of the minister is the prayer of the people / by Gods ordinance / whiles they thinck one thinge / and are mett to one end / for auoyding confusion one speaketh / yet al pray togeather one thing. But the minister may as well preach and pray / or reade anie chapter and praye / as reade praiers / and praye both in one action of the minde / and voyce / which were strange. Your cauill then / whether the heart may be moved / and pray / both at once / is taken awaye / seing you graunt reading and praying / two seuerall excercises of the heart and voyce / which cannot be performed at once with liuely voyce. The con|clusion is then / that either ye must fetch the matter out of your booke whe~ you reade prayer / and so do not pray for the particular wa~ts wher with the heart is moued and pressed before you come / or els you pray not with liuely voyce at al / when you read. The Lorde then hauing taught vs to breake vp our owne hearts / and powre fourth our owne petitions with heart and voyce / gyve grace to all his people so to wor|ship him.

<P>But seing you would take vpon you to set so manie perscript formes of prayer / as ther is thinges necessarie for euerie assemblie to pray for / wher Christ hath set none / And if yt were a thing so necessarie to have prescript wordes at the administration of the Sacraments / I asked you whether our sauiour Christ had not forgott himself as you thought that when he commaunded his ministers to go preach and baptise / and shewed them the words of institution / and the Elementes to be vsed with all things thervnto needfull / he did not prescribe some forme of wordes for prayer in particular: In the tabernacle euerie pinne was prescribed / so that ether such formes of praier are not necessarie / or Chri+stes Testament hath some wants.

<P>And in this your wisedome / let vs see what is the chiefest inconuenie~|cy that would growe. You say euerie fra~ticke spirit (of which sorte ther be manie in the ministerie) would not only be vnlike themselues / but va|rie from others. I answered / and still do / that the Papists haue not so weake a reason for their Idolatrous <HI>liturgies / Rubricks, &amp; Canons.</HI> You say yt appeareth by all my Arguments / how meete a man I am to iud|ge the weight of reasons alleadged by the Papists / and others: well I am weake / and you strong / foolish / and you wise / yet might you haue shewed me a weaker reason which they alleadge for their constitutious ecclesiastical / as they call them. But my chief answere was (wherby you might haue beene satisfied) that if it were but in Phrases the ministerie should differ / yt is no sufficient cause to ordeine <HI>liturgies.</HI> And if they of|fend in matter of doctrine or conversation / the censure of the Church should help that. The first you graunt / the second also you confesse / that the Church should censure such thinges: But you say ther are sundrie o|ther differe~ces in administration of publique prayers and Sacrame~ts as in order and ceremonies which the Church is to haue regard of / and not to leaue arbitrarie. All other ceremonies in Gods worship then Christ and his Apostles haue prescribed vs / are diabolicall / and not A|postolical. Then / for all thinges donne in the Church in those publique actions / the offenders must be admonished / if they transgresse the rules of the word. And for the orers you speake of / you meane circumsta~ces of time / place / kneeling / sitting / standing etc. of them thet can be no fur|der lawes / then Christ hath prescribed / that all things be donne to edify+ing / in comelyues and decency etc. of these to set particular lawes / were to breake the lawe of God / which leaueth them in the Churches liberty as neede requireth / to the glorie of God.

<P>Well / here you haue made a faire hand / to make read prayers but a matter of order / which is all the worship you haue / to bring in mens writings into the publique assemblies / to make then ether rules to bind the conscience / and so put them in the place of Gods booke / or to reade them ouer for praying / is but a matter of order / well then put them in your cornerd Capp / we haue enough rules for the ordering of Christs spouse / without such Babilonish ware.

<P>FIrst / in this your papisticall mudde / I must tell you / your reading of me~s writinges for prayer / is a false worship of God / and not a mat|ter of circumstance, And for matters of order and circumstance / which are no part of the worship / ther can be no other lawes made of the~ / the~ Christ hath made: As for ordeyning of lawes in the church / it is to plead for vnwritten verities / and to make the lawe of God vnsufficie~t: nether ca~ yt be according to the worde / to make anie lawe / that God hath not made / but an adding to his worde / which is execrable pride: these your wordes then (according to Gods worde) was but a cloake to couer the grosseues of your position: for the worde / ordeyne / or create lawes / is to make some / that are not made before: let vs the~ see your cleane sentence to be this / <HI>The Church hath aucthority in matters of order &amp; circumstance to make &amp; ordeine lawes in his Church&punc; for his worship</HI>: nowe see how you contradict these Scriptures. Rev. 22.18.19. Prov. 30.5.6. euerie worde of God is pure etc. put nothing to his worde least he reprooue thee a~d thou be found a liar. likwise Deut. 4.2. and 12.32. and Gal. 3.15. though it be but a mans covenant / when it is confirmed / no man doth abrogate it / or superordeine anie thing to it. And the second Commaundeme~t for|biddeth anie such humane tradition in the worship of God: all the Po|pes trinckets might be brought in by the same grounde: We would wil+lingly haue seene your warra~t for this doctrine / your bare worde is not sufficient to impose other lawes then God hath made / vpo~ his Church. This is the foundation of poperie and Anabaptistrie / to giue libertie to make lawes in the worship of God. Yet you will go furder / that such lawes being ordeyned and established by publique auctoritye / the disci|pline and censures of the CHVRCH are to driue men to the obser|vation of the same. By your iudgment our Sauiour CHRIST was an Anabaptisticall Schismatique / that would not himself / nor his Disciples / obey and obserue the traditions of the Elders: And what saith he vnto pleaders for traditions.

<P>And to helpe fourth your euill matter / instead of proof from the scrip+ture / you fall out into furious exclamation against them that desire on|ly to haue the worde practized: saying / who is able to imagine the innu|merable divisions and offences in the practize of your anabaptisticall freedome / in which you deny the Church to have power to ordeine and impose any orders? lett all men iudge the venemousenes of this tongue / Christ pronounceth them accursed that add or super ordeyne any thing to his worde / and you pronounce iudgment of them / that only obey his worde. Shall yt be said that Mr. Gifford holdeth / that the only practi|ze of Gods worde / would be the cause of innumerable diuisions and of|fences? This hath bene Satans old accusation in the mouth of the most enimies of Christs Gospell: nowe yt must be Mr. Giffords accusation of Gods ordinances / to be insufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vnperfect / etc. fearfull is his Apo+stacy from that truth he hath knowen. I take it / yt is more like to be A|nabaptistry / to practise any thing without warrant of the word / to ma|ke their owne devises lawes / in Gods worship / then to do nothing but what God hath commaunded / within the limites of our callings.</P>
<P>For the fra~ticke ministery / yt came of your owne wordes / that ther|fore you must needes haue a <HI>liturgie,</HI> because ther are manie fra~tick spi|rits in the ministerie? then I say / it is like you haue a frantick ministe|rie / that cannot be gouerned without an other <HI>liturgie</HI> then Christs Te|stament: For their great giftes you speake of: I will not compare with them.</P>
<P>My reason from the <HI>Colossians</HI> was that as the church there is com|maunded to admonish their Pastor Archippus / if he transgressed / and to stirr him vp to his busines / so all minister<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that caused divisions / con|trary to the doctrine of Christ / were to be admonished / and auoyded / if then repent not: so that the worde of God / and admonition by the same / if they transgressed / is the waye to keepe all men in due order / and not imposing <HI>liturgies</HI> vpon the church / besides Christs Testament.</P>
<P>And where you collected thus / that if read praiers / and imposed <HI>litur|gies</HI> be Idolatrous / the~ wher will you finde a visible church / say you. I answered that the true Church might erre / euen in this poynte / though not in like height of sinne.

<P>HEre / after your acustomed maner / you offer me great wronge: first / insteade of answere / you alter the question very subtylie: then you dismember my former answere / and not only so / but you haue nether let my former a~swere be a~swered / nor prynted. Thus you alter the questio~ / and answere not / where the Propositio~ speaketh of a ministerie a~d peo|ple standing vnder a false gouernme~t / you say the Church may be holde~ vp force / from executing Gods commaundements in externall gouern|ment / wherof I never doubted: what is this then / but to deceaue your Reader / both to iudge sinisterlie of me / and be drawen from the truth himself? But indeede you meane not this (holden by force) of ciuile bon|dadge or persequution / for then ther were no difference betweene vs / a~d myne Argument should stand vntouched. You affirme then that the Church may stand vnder a false gouernement / inforced therunto by the tyranny of the ennemie / and yet in that estate be the true apparant Church / by open profession / which is nothing / els / then that the Church may professe Christianisme and Antichristianisme / both at a tyme / sub|iect in minde to Christ / and subiect to Antichrist in outwarde obedie~ce. That you hold this doctrine in this place / the processe of your matter proueth / and to make all plaine / your wordes in the last writing (which here you summe vp) were these. <HI>But if the Church at any tyme be by may|ne force restrayned from some priuiledges, or haue some gouernement set ouer it, which agreeth not with GODS worde, which it cannot auoide &amp;c.</HI> See nowe how smoothly this man hath put away the crosse of Christ / by teaching men to stand vnder a gouernement / contra|rye to Christes. I thought the ordinances of the newe Testament had beene a kingdome that could not be shaken. Heb.: 2.28. that none could haue beene a me~ber of Christ / <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 14.9 10.11.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> that receaueth the marcke of the Beast / though yt be but in his hand / or could be holden a member of Christ / by outward profession / that here had beene the patience of the Saincts / to suffer vnto death / rather then to bowe downe / either in minde or bodie to an other gouernment / then Christs. How is he a Lorde to them that are not gouerned by him? Well I needed not haue stand vpon this doc|trine / but that he nether prynted my former answere / nor answered in
<PB N="38" REF="25">
these pointes / and myne owne copie taken from me by the Bishops: so that this man may retract what he will and accuse as please him: if he haue anie common honestie / let my former answere be seene.</P>
<P>But to proue the Church may be subiect to an other gouernement then Christs / which is euen to say / that a man may gyue all alleageance by outward practize to the Kinge of Spaigne / and yet be her Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; true subiect / He saith / the Church was holden captiue in Babilon / where he as conningly hideth himself as before / though in my last writing I vr|ged him to answere / whether the Church in Babilo~ was subiect to their Idolatrie / or no. To the ciuile power I doubt not they were: But if the Priestes and Leuites stood Priests to the Idolatrous worship in Ba|bilon / whether the people of Israel bowed downe to the outward prac|tise and obedience of their Idolatrie / or no: then / if they did so / whether they stoode by profession the childre~ of God / or apostatate in that estate None of these thinges haue you answeared me. Let the exa~ples of Ha|nania / Mishaell / and Azarin testifie Dan. 3. The people that retourned repented their transgressions / wher they had any of them sinned / and made a new couenant with the Lorde / before they were receaued / Ezra 9.14.15. and 10. Cap. 2.3.8. Yea the voyce of God was this / come out of her my people / a~d touche no vncleane thing and I wilbe your God. We are before thee (saith Ezra) in our trespasse / and we cannot stand before thee because of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa 52.11 Jerem 51.6.45.</NOTE> You never renounced your Antichristian ministerie / you neuer made newe couenant since the deepe defectio~ of Poperye / but still minister in that kingdome / and wil not repent / yet boast your selves to be the Church of God / cryinge out / the Temple the Temple. I ans|weare then directlie / that whiles you sta~d subiect vnto / and practize a~d communicate with other orders and gouernments / then Christes / you are not by outwarde professio~ the Churches of Christ. I may not with you omitt the worde (willfull) because you persequute the light / and so much higher is your sinne. Here I must forewarne the Reader / with dili+ge~ce to consider Mr. Giffords disagreement and mine / he hauing accu|sed me of a fundame~tall heresie (as he calleth it) wheras he himself still maintayneth most grosse errors / wher of I reproued him / yet he persis|teth / Namely / that the regenerate man may be said to stand in bondage to sinne / by reason of the corruption of the fleshe that is in vs / a~d of our vnperfectnes in this life. Then / that one standing in outwarde bondage to ope~ knowe~ sinne / may in that estate be accompted and co~municated with / as the serua~t of Christ by outward profession / both at one instant: which is asmuch to say / we may be to ma~s sight / the seruaunt of the de|uill / and the seruaunt of Christ / both at one tyme / by outward profession: so none should be exco~municate: none be without / te world a~d the church light and darcknes / Christ and Belial / should be mingled togeather.</P>
<P>The heresie wherof / he most vniustly and vntruly proclaymeth to be mainteyned by vs / is / that the regenerate man consenteth not to sinne / after regeneration / although in the last writinge I testified the co~trary: Namely that the whole church might erre / might co~mitt some kinde of
<PB N="39" REF="25">
Idolatrie / that no ma~ was free from co~mitting sinne etc. And now I testifie to all the world / that I was neuer infected with anie such <HI>An|abaptistry,</HI> but haue euerie where resisted such dannable heresie. I haue learned and taught manie degrees of sinne / and differe~ces of tra~sgressi|ons / which the deare children of God fall into / after regeneration / in thought word and deed / of ignorance / of knowledge / of presumptio~ / slip|pes / transgressions / and obstinate sinne: Yea that ther is no sinne / except ehe sinne against the Holy Ghost / but Gods childre~ / may co~mitt it after regeneration / and be renued by repentance / which we ought to pray for in all sinners / but that one sinne except. Not that men should herevpon take boldnes to sinne / because God giueth repe~tance to his elect / wher|in the riches of his mercy appeareth / but rather serue him in trembling and feare / as a iealous God / least with Esaw we find no place to repen|tance / though we seeke yt with teares. Againe / though in Gods sight / his elected are neuer forsake~ vtterlie / nor the Holy Ghost vtterly extin|guished in the repenerate / yet to mans iudgment he that co~mitteth ope~ knowe~ sinne / and persisteth obstinatly in the same / cannot be held the child of God to vs / by outward profession / but must be cutt of Nombers 15.27.31. Math. 18.17. and 1. Cor. 5. till they repent: Much more none that sta~d ope~ professed me~bers of te false church / subiect by the least out|ward bowing downe to this antichristia~ <HI>Hierarchie,</HI> a~d so co~tinuing in bo~+dage to a false gouernme~t / ca~ be holde~ of vs te true professors of Christs Gospel. Now let vs peruse te seueral doctrines. Mr. Gifford affirmeth / that the true church migt sta~d in bo~dage to a false gouernme~t / yet in that estate be helde / and co~municated with / as the true Church / by outward profession: his wordes in waye of proof / be these. They may with St. Paule say / it is no longer I that do it / but sinne that dwelleth in me: for if the yoake wherwith he was held captiue in part / could not take from him / but that he was the Lordes free seruaunt / it is no reaso~ that some outwarde bondage should make the Church not to be the spouse of Christ. If a man commaund his wife (saith he) to do a thinge / and ther be violent force to withhold her / shee is not to be blamed. Rom. 7. Mine answere to this he durst not print / but peruerteth my wordes / so manie as pleaseth him / nether can I yet come by a copie of my former writing to shew / what I the~ replyed. Now consider what gouernmnet is / and what bondage is / and then behold the wickednes of this man: Spiritu|all gouernmet is that souereigntie / Dominion: and regiment that Christ Iesus / by his spirit / lawes / ordina~ces / and officers / exerciseth in a~d ouer hys church / as yt is writte~: <HI>And thou Bethlee~ Iuda art not the least among the Princes of Iuda, for out of thee shall come a gouernour that shall gouer+ne my people Israell.</HI> againe / <HI>thy Scepter is an uer lasting Scepter. I haue set my king vpon Syon my Holy mountaine,</HI> Mat. 2.6. Psa. 2. and 45. and 110. these lawes a~d ordina~ces wherby this kinge raigneth / are caled a king|dome that ca~not be shake~ Heb. 12.28.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mal 12.6</NOTE> they that haue not him to reigne ouer the~ / are by outward professio~ none of his. <HI>If I be your lord, where is my honor</HI>? againe <HI>those myne enimies which would not that I should reigne ouer the~, bring bether, and slay the~ before me. Luke</HI> 19.27
<PB N="40" REF="26">
Also bondage or seruitude is to be al commaundement / and to yeild o|bedience in subiection. Now to be in outward bondage to an other out|ward government / other lawes / officers / and ordinances then Christs / is to be by outward subiection servantes of Antichrist / which layeth an other foundation: for by outward profession we cannot stand (to mans iudgment) professed subiects to two kings at enimitye / But we must be an enimie to the one / and so esteemed of all me~ / much lesse members vn|to two divers heades.</P>
<P>This then is mine answere here. 1. That it is an heresie to say a man may stand in bondage to open knowen sinne / and the free seruaunt of Christ to vs by outward profession / both at one instant. 2. That it is a falsifying of the Scripture / to say that St. Paul (in the 7. to the Roma|nes) was in bondage to sinne / when he / in the inner man resisted sinne / and daylie preuailed against the sinne / which his flesh would haue led him captiue in / if there had not beene a stronger power to ouercome that enimie. For he ther reasoneth of the benefite of the lawe / to mani|fest our sinne / and our conquest ouer sinne by daylie repentance / and re|prouing of sinne in our selues / fighting against sinne / victory ouer sinne / thoughe yt contynuallie rebell. 3. How blasphemous were yt to conty|nue in knowen sinne / in bondage to yt / and to say / it is sinne that dwel|leth in vs / and not we / and so still to blesse our selves without amende|ment. O horrible peruertinge of the Scriptures to mens destruction. 2. Pet. 3.16.4. That ther is no Argument to be drawen / nor consequen|ce to followe / from the reliques of sinne / and corruption of the fleshe in one man / or the whole Church / and a professed bondage to al false go|vernment: no not betweene the open committing of sinne in the whole Church / or some m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbers therof / and a professed homage and subiecti|on vnto a false gouernment / we cannot be partakers with the false Church and true / at no hand. 1. Cor. 10.21 / 5. Lastlie / that the subiection to an other gouernement / is as a wife that committeth adulterie. Hosea 2.</P>
<P>I then reason thus on the contrary with you. Any man that after re|generation committeth open knowen sinne / and contynueth obstinate / as a bond seruaunt thervnto / standeth not the professed seruaunt of Christ / but of synne Ezechiel. 18. till he repent / so the whole Church / that persisteth in open knowen sinne / and persequuieth the messengers that reproue the same. Then / as euerie member of the false Church standeth a professed seruaunt of sinne / so the whole assemblies that stand profes|sed subiects of false gouernment / no censures sf admonition belonging vnto them / but calling of them to repentance and seperation from the false Church. Then / as the wife that geueth her self to be one with an other man / is an adulteresse Rom. 7.3. so that Church that subiecteth herself to an other gouernment / ordinances / and lawes then Christs / is an harlot. Now lett all men say / whether I had not iust cause to say / you spake like a carnall libertine / and an Athiest&punc; yea nowe / as one having his conscience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eared / to affirme / that the Church / remayninge in open
<PB N="41" REF="26" MS="y">
knowe bondage to a false gouernment / may saye as Paul said / it is not I that sinne. And / that contynuing in that adulterie / she is the spouse of Christ by outward profession. You would saye it were a false Ar|gument / to say / the Church hath manie imperfections / ignorances / transgressions etc. therfore standeth in bondage to sinne / nay standeth in bondage to an other heade / and an other government then Christs / Euen so / to saye the Church doth sinne / therfore may contynue in bon|dage to sinne / is false doctrine: nay / to say it may stand in open pro|fessed subiection to Antichrist / and be esteemed the CHURCH of CHRIST by outward profession in that estate / is damnable doc|trine.</P>
<P>It is the flat contradiction of all the rules of the Scripture / to say / a man may stand in bondage to sinne / and the free servaunt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Christ by outward profession / by mans iudgment / at one tyme / seing the obsti|nate offenders are to be cast out of the assemblie: But nowe / though the regenerate may fall into these highe sinnes / and contynue in their sinne a long time / yea manie yeares depriued of GODS grace / to mans seeming / and to vs is the seruant of Satan for anie thing wee see / yet the Spirit of GOD is never vtterlie extinguished or departed / after regeneration / but will recouer the man againe / and bring him to repentance / as David after a whole yeare / for the stronge man once di|splaced and cast out by a stronger then he / the spirit neuer vtterly de|parteth againe / for then yt were impossible that ma~ should be renewed Mat. 1.2.31. Heb. 10.26 and 6.4.</P>
<P>And herevpon I might saye / Paul never contynued captiue in sinne / but was alwaies renewed by repentance. Furder / this spirit of God (the sparkes wherof were never quenched vtterlie) did not / nor could not consent or giue place vnto sinne / for here is the enimitye and battel betweene the spirite and the flesh / euerie where spoken of Gal. 5,16.17. Rom. 7. May I not now say then / that Paul never contynued capti|ue vnto sinne / nor consented vnto sin concerninge the Inner man or ga|ve place vnto sinne in that place mentioned / without heresie: And still reproue you / that when Paul reasoneth of the old man / or corruption in him / you will conclude yt of the new man / or inner man / and of the whole man / when you see euidently / he opposeth the one against the other: For whiles the spirit striueth against sinne / and raigneth in vs / thoughe the fleshe rebell / and cause vs to sinne seauen times a daye / yet are we not ouercome of sinne / so to remayne in bondage to sinne / that it should contynue to reigne in vs / as you may see in the same chapter Rom. 7.5.6. Where you alleage then / that Paul saw a lawe in his mem|bers / which did lead him captiue vnto sinne / you do falsifie the text: for he saith leading me captiue / and not did leade etc. for ther was a stron|ger man / or a stronger then man / that suffered not the lawe of his mem+bers to reigne: for saith he / I my self in my minde serue the law of God / but in the flesh the law of sinne / so that the whole man could not be said to serue sinne. But (say you) afterward as concerning then the
<PB N="42" REF="27">
inner man we may be said to serue the lawe of God / and thervpon be called the free seruantes of Christ / notwithstanding this corruption of sinne in the flesh: So the whole man by reaso~ of our imperfectnes may be said to be the servants of sinne. No / yt is not true / for the whole man is called after the part thath hat greather rule in vs: as if the fleshe rule in vs / we are the servaunts of sinne / and ledd by Satan at his pleasure / but if the Spirit rule in vs / we are the seruauntes of God / Sonnes of God / Sainctes of God / Citizens of Ierusalem / holie and free people / Kinges / and Priests: not that we are perfect / or sin|ne not / but that sinne reygneth not in vs / but the spirit / wherby we sup|presse sinne / reprove sinne / striue against sinne / subdue sinne / and though we fall seuen times / yet we rise againe by repentance / and serue not sin|ne. Rightly therfore did I saye / that no man can serve two masters: for his servantes we are to whom we gyue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our selues as seruants to obey / whether yt be of sinne / vnto death / or of obedience / vnto righteous+nes. Rom. 6.16.18. being made free from sinne / we are made the ser|vantes of righteousnes: So that the regenerat man / or he that is by outward profession the servant of Christ / cannot be called the ser|vant of sinne / by reason of the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uption of the old man / and dregges of sinne / neither can he that standeth in bo~dage to anie sinne / and giueth himself ouer to yt / be called in that estate the servant of Christ / till he re|pent / but the servant of sinne. 2. Pet. 2.19.</P>
<P>Therfore you must recant your false interpretation of Paul in the 7. to the Rom. and cease your blasphemous raylings / in calling the trueth of God / the rocke of Brownisme. And consider the height of your sin|ne / by concluding a bondage vnto sinne of the wholeman / for the corrup+tions of the fleshe / which through the worke of the Spirit is daylie subdued / though never vtterly rooted out of our earthlie members: and from the committing sinne through frayltie / an obstinate professed bon+dage to the false Church / false gouernment / false ministerie etc. which is plainly the marck of the Beast / to whom with outward obedien|ce they bowe downe / and stand servants in his kingdome Revel. 14.9.11.12.</P>
<P>As for the 4. of the Galat. 26. where the Apostle saith / Ierusalem which is aboue is free with her Children / yo udurst not open yt / nor expound yt / but blaspheame / raile / and sclander / as though we should pleade for such a freedome / as should detract from Magistrates lawfull aucthorities / from having Gods ordinances established by commaun|dement vpon the Church etc. yea / that we should hold Anabaptisticall freedome / as though we had power not to committ / or consent vnto sin+ne wheras we haue euerie where by practise and protestation / by word and writing testified to our Souereigne Prince / and to all men / the con|trary. But Satan that old accuser and detracter of Gods children / to deceaue the world / sendeth out such lyinge spirites to deface the trueth. We / with all subiection and willinge obedience to our souereigne. Prin|ce / teach all men their obedience to the higher powers: Subiectes to
<PB N="43" REF="27" MS="y">
Magistrates / Flocke to Ouerseers / children to Pare~tes / wines to their husbands / servantes to their Masters etc. in all things in the Lorde: and if they commaund vs anie thing contrary to the lawe of God / we then patientlie suffer without resistance / or rebellious thaughtes: The freedome then we haue to speake of here / which Christ hath purchased for vs / is / first that triumphe ouer Hell / Deathe / a~d damnatio~ / through the merites of Christ apprehended by faith / wayted for in hope / Rom. 8. Secondly / that because we were sonnes by election / he giueth vs the spirit of adoption / and sanctification / wherebie we mortifie the fleshe / have reigne and dominion ouer sinne / that yt shall never reigne in vs more vnto condemnation / repenting daylie our trespasses / and crauing pardon for our hidden sinnes / and secret faultes. Thirdly / we are throughe the same spirit and worde of trueth deliuered from all subiec|tion of Antichist / of the false Church / false ministerie / false gouernment etc. And. they that haue not this freedome / are not by outward profes|sion the seruauntes of Christ. Furder / we haue freedome from all tra|ditions of men that seing we are bought with a pryce / we are no longer seruants of men / to be in bondage to anie beggerly rudimentes or devi|ses of me~ / but in all peaceable maner / to worship and serve God within the limites of our callings / according to the word of God / as yt is reue|aled vnto vs: We haue freedome to speake the trueth with all bold|nes / though all men should inhibite vs: we would not haue the doctri|ne limited / stinted / bought and sold / for Iewishe tythes or mercenarie stipendes.</P>
<P>We have freedome to seperate from such false&punc; Prophetts as your self / to come out of Babel etc. And in the true Church to reproue and withstand anie sinne or traditions of me~ in due order / only to be guided and gouerned by Christes lawes and ordina~ces: In all this I trust you shall not find anie Anabaptistrie in the freedome we professe: this is the truth of the Gospell / wherbie we are made free.</P>
<P>Thus then we still affirme / that they which stand in open knowen bondage to sinne / are the seruants of sinne / and not of CHRIST / till they repent / by outward profession. Furder / that allwhich stand mem|bers of your parish assemblies / stand not members of CHRIST by outward profession / but in bondage to a false and Antichristian ministery / gouernment / worship etc. and the bond woeman and her sonne must be cast out. Furder / for all <HI>liturgies,</HI> and other devises of me~ besides the canonicall Scriptures and liuely graces of his Spirit / we hold they ought not to be brought into the publique assemblies / nor im+posed vpon mens consciences: But if anie will write such / or reade such / let yt be for their private vse / as all other mens writings: we despise not any directions by word or writing / that may furder vs anie way to the practize of GODS ordinances / yet may they nether be im|posed vpon mens consciences / not be made a part of GODS worship.</P>

<HEAD>A Fewe obseruations of Mr. Giffards last cavills about stinted read prayers / and devised Leitourgies.</HEAD>
<P>HAving hertofore written an answere to Mr. George Giffards pre|tended defence of stinted read praiers and devised Leitourgies / and since receiued an emptie replie / wherin he doth nothing lesse then yeild to any sound reason alledged / but vngodlily cauilleth at and peruersly wresteth the sence of so much as he toucheth / I seeing no cause of fur|ther strife (his former convinced) to intermedle againe with perticular handling of his chaffe and smoke / his reasons in effect the same before a~swered / haue only thought it my dutie to illustrate vnto the Readers / some few brief poincts abused by him / that they may the better be able to iudge of the former writings / where vnto with these few helpes fol|lowing I refer the trial.</P>
<P>WHeras I alledged out of the 8. to the Rom. and out of the 4. to the Galath. that in the verie time and action of our praying to God / the spirit of God was the on|ly help / no other help mentioned or that can be collec|ted in the Scriptures / Mr. Giffard having granted that reading pra|yer is not praying / doth now answere / <HI>that howsoeuer the Scriptu|re doth extol and magnifie outward helpes and meanes, yet when they are compared with God which worketh all in all by them, or when the Scripture will set forth the efficacie and worke to be his alone, they are either not mentioned, or els if they be mentioned, so cast downe, as if they were nothing. God buyldeth his Church (saith he) by the ministerie of men, yet Paul is said to plant, Apollos to Water, but God to gyve the encrease</HI> 1. Cor, 3. <HI>and therfore to gather from those places Rom.</HI> 8. <HI>Gala&punc; 4. that there neede or may be no outward help or meanes in the verie action and instant of praying, is far awrye.</HI> In which answer it euide~tly appeareth he is so bent to turne away all truth and raise new strife / as ther can be no expectation of agreement: There is no sequence / neither doth the scripture alledged prove his owne reaso~ / so that nothing ha~gs togeather. No ma~ doubteth but that sometimes and in some places of scripture the outward meanes of begetting and encreasing faith is on|ly recited / a~d sometimes the secret work of Gods spirit only / sometimes both / when yet they are not diuided but goe together / a~d all of God both inward worke and outward meanes / though in way of comparison I never so read / but rather the one repeated for both: For shal I say / that when the work of God and preaching therof is shewed to be the power of God vnto saluation / that the inward worke of the Spirit is therfo|re not mentioned / because the other is of God? then both inward and
<PB N="46" REF="29">
outward meanes being of God / a~d Gods owne worke / though the one by instrument / that there is silencing of the one in way of co~parison / is not true. But all this is nothing to our matter: He should plainly haue affirmed / that fro~ these places Ro~. 8. a~d Gal. 4. it ca~not be proued / that in the very insta~t tyme a~d actio~ of owre praying to God / the spirit only instructeth / without outward helpes of instruction / and he should haue seene I could proue (as the~ I did) the contrarie vnto him Ro~. 8.26. <HI>The spirit doth together supplye or help our infirmities for we knowe not what to pray as we ougt, but the spirit yt self maketh request for vs with sighes a~d grones vnvtterable.</HI> In the actio~ of praying the spirit is here set dow+ne in this place to be the meanes and help of instructio~ / teaching vs to aske aright / no other meanes or helpes of instruction in that instant ti|me and action of praying mentioned in this or any other place of scrip|ture: Therfore in the time of our praying and laying our hearts ope~ to God / the Spirit only doth instruct and openeth our mouth. In this place let the word <HI>synan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilambanetai</HI> be wel considered. Againe Gal. 4.6 it is said <HI>because yee are sonnes, God sent the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts crying, Abba, Father,</HI> The Argume~t here is the same thet before: this word (<HI>crying</HI>) sheweth the worcke of his Spirit or rather office / in our continuall occasions of prayer to direct vs to vnburden and vnfold the heart / so that in the insta~t action we see no other.

Euery simple ma~ wil laugh at him (saith he) if he make the~ prayer ytself: a~d if they be helpes / the~ I haue brought the former proofes not fro~ an idle / but from an vnsound brayne.

Further / how learnedly he disputeth to make reading one of these bodily gestures or bodily actions only / let it be co~sidered of. And as he co~foundeth these bodily exercises and spirituall exercises / so he sheweth himself ignorant and vnable to discerne spiritual gyftes and exercises one from an other / with the distinct vse of them: demanding whither the voyce of an other tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prayeth / be an outward help or

But now God hath otherwise taught 1. Cor. 14. a~d Acts. 4. yt must needs be / that Mr. Giss. is in great error to thinke none but he that speaketh prayeth. I take then such hearing of an others voyce / praying / a~d this to be a fou|le error to publish the contrarie but that prayer both edifieth him that speaketh and him that heareth / and together in heart prayeth / I make no doubt. Yet herevpon to affirme / that here are other meanes of in|struction to be vsed in the instant action of praying then praying yt self / were as grosse as the other / and both a confounding of spiritual exerci|ses / and flat contradiction of the Scripture / especially so diverse weigh|tie actions of minde and bodie / as <HI>proseuche,</HI> a~d <HI>anagnosis,</HI> powring out our hearts to God in prayer / and reading. At other times I did not on+ly allow / but teach / that we haue al the dayes of our lyves need to be in|structed to pray aright / and that reading is a blessed meanes therevn|to. So that you see whiles you of purpose will oppose / you runne your self vpon the rocke: in stead of justifying your accusatio~ of two heresies to be found in my first reason / you haue published this follie / which you must retract / if you wil obey the truth. Mr. Giffard the~ granting / that reading is but to help to prayer and not praying / a~d now being shewed that it ca~ be no help in that instant action of praying / let vs proceede to pervse an other of his mistakings and willful peruertings. I affirming that the holy Ghost neuer enioyned vs to any certaine nu~ber of words by stint and limitatio~ in praying / as commanding the very words to be said ouer whe~ we pray / he euery where in his wrytings as a supposed foundatio~ to their Leitourgie and Collects / alledged out of Numbers the 6. Mat. 6. Lu. 11. exa~ple of Psalmes / a~d now Deu. 26. that the Lord did by co~ma~deme~t binde the~ to those verie words saiing ouer / whe~ they prayed or blessed in those formes which are there prescribed. For my reasons in disproving this popish carnal co~ceipt / I refer the Reader to my former answeare to his plublished pretended defence of reading for praying. One reaso~ was drawe~ fro~ the words of the text Numb. 6.32. where the hebrew words <HI>Coh Tebara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u,</HI> thus shal you blesse / do not im|port a tying the~ to the verie words of this forme in blessing / but to the rules and instructions there taught them concerning the matter yt self for their direction / which I collected by this word <HI>Coh,</HI> which is an ad|verb of similitude / signifiing with vs as much as (after this maner) and therfore ca~not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o say the same words / but according to the same in|structions. Where first he reprocheth me for that <HI>Tebaracu</HI> was false
<PB N="48" REF="30">
printed / therevpon chardging me I cannot reade twoo words right of hebrue / which were no great ignominie in their priesthood: But shall we say Mr. Giff. cannot reade two words in latine rightly / because in the 28. page of his booke he repeateth out of Augustine / upoli sui / for po+puli sui? This I mention / as sory to see the defendor of his false Hierar|chie so emptie / to leaue founde doctrine / and thus to trifle: if he had bene at the print / it should haue bene ame~ded it seemeth. Now to the doctri|ne gathered of this word <HI>Coh.</HI> Mr. Gif. would invert the words in his owne se~se / thus: that where I said / the Lord did not co~maund to say the same words but the like / that is according to those directions of doctri|ne / he gathereth / that I should affirme yt vnlawfull to vse those words at all / yea that they might not vse all or anie of these words at anie ty|me. Whether this be a Christian interpretation of my words or no / I leaue not only to all mens / but chieflie to his owne conscience to be con|sidered. Yet he still couertly persisting in his error / produceth a place of scripture / where the word <HI>Coh</HI> (as he thinketh) is vsed for the saying of the verie words. Exod.;. The Lord said to Moses / Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel Eheie hath sent me vnto yee / moreouer God said vnto Moses / thus shalt thou say vnto them / The God of your Fa|thers etc. According to Mr. Grenewoods interpretation (saith he) Mo|ses is not commanded to say those words / but the like. True / he is not here bound to this certeine number of words / or the same words. If then they should say / what is his name that hath sent thee / he may not say Eheie hath sent me / because God said <HI>Coh</HI> etc. Now Mr. Giffard sheweth himself ashifter: I did neuer hold it vnlawfull to vse anie wor|des of the Scripture as need required / it is your sclander: where you have in all your bookes affirmed we hold it vnlawfull to say thy king|dome come / or vse anie phrase of Scripture to right vse: your woeful wresting of the tongue for vntruthes / wil tourne to your further iudg|ment. I proued only by the word <HI>Coh,</HI> which signifieth (after this ma|ner) that God commaunded not the very certaine number of words to be said.</P>
<P>And where I sayd the word <HI>Coh</HI> was so vsed in all the Prophets (when they say / Thus saith the Lord) to this end / that neither the holy Ghost had registredal their verie words they spake&punc; nor that they were tyed to the prescript number of words / he would haue it thought I should hold those words which are recorded / not to be the words of God / which wresting of my words / is but his emptie quarreling to tur+ne away this firme doctrine: namely / that God did in those formes of prayer mentioned by him / prescribe the somme of their blessings a~d pe|titions / whervnto they ought according to their seuerall occasions wi|thin the limits of these doctrines / frame their suites and desires / a~d did not tye them to a certaine number of words. Now he finding himself pressed / in that al his proofes are at once brought to be weapo~s against him rather then warrant / It being prooved vnto him that those for|mes are repeated in other words in other places / and that the Priests
<PB N="49" REF="30" MS="y">
vsed other in blessing the people / as Eli blessed Hanna: also that the Apostles vsed other words in prayer / and neuer that verie forme and number of words / he playnly denyeth that our question was about the bynding and limiting to the verie words by commandement / and saith our question was / whither it were idolatrie to vse those prescript phrases or no. Thus the man is sled / not only contradicting all his writinges / making voide his proofes / but granting as much as I af|firmed vpon the word <HI>COH</HI> hath gyven mee the whole cause against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is will: For if these places will not serue to prove an apportioning by number and stint vpon commandement / then Mr. Gissard hath no pro+fe for his Collect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> / no though these had bene so / yet his patched broken mass booke shoulde haue bene far from comming in place of true pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yer.</P>
<P>But that this is a popish dreame to think in prayer they were bound to some certeyne number of words saying ouer / it was also conuinced vnto him by the Greeke word <HI>Houtos,</HI> where Christ commandeth his Disciples saying / <HI>When you pray, pray thus, Our Father, &amp;c.</HI> Which word <HI>Thus</HI> Mat. 6.9. singnifieth (after this maner) or according to this forme / rules / and instructions: for if the commandement shoulde goe to bynde vs to the very words / then this word (<HI>when</HI> you pray) would bynd vs never to vse other words / for the text saith / <HI>when you pray, say thus.</HI> To this he answereth / that respecting the rules for matters / <HI>when</HI> is as much as whensoeuer you pray / because we may not depart from those matters conteyned in those general petitions: But in words it is not so there / We must consider to distinguish et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3. Wel / hath he not lost himself / and still against his will yeilded the matter: namely that wee are not in these formes of prayer bound to the verie words saying ouer / and that the holy Ghost did neuer by commandement stint or li|mit vs to anie words in praying / which in deed is common with inchan+ters: And I take it he will easily yeild me this point / for if he remember <HI>Augustine</HI> to teach / that then we pray that prayer which Christ taught his Disciples / when our prayers are grounded vpon those doctrines and instructions / or to that effect: And Calvine to say: the Sonne of ma~ would not prescribe vs what words we must vse in prayer / he should haue put vs to lesse trouble: So that besids his mass-booke was neuer prescribed by the Lord himself or warrant of his word / he seeth it vn+lawful to apportion / limit and stint as by measure and waight certeine numbers of wordes / sente~ces etc. in prayer. As for his examples of the Psalmes: I refer to my former answere / namely / that praying is our thing / and singing a psalme an other.</P>
<P>Now then we haue heard that reading is not praying or any help to pray in the instant action of praying / when we should powre forth our owne hearts to God: Also that it is vnlawful to bynde ma~ to numbers of words or sentences in praying. Let vs come to the first generall ar|gument / which is this. No Apocrypha must be brought into the publick assemblies / for there only Gods word and the lively voyce of
<PB N="50" REF="31">
his owne graces must be heard in the publick assemblies: But mens wrytings and the reading them ouer for prayer are Apocrypha: Ther|fore may not be brought into the publick assemblies / eyther for lawes or worship. Here hee finds fault with the worde Apocrypha (al|though it hath bene an antient word in this sense / and now published in their Bibles to distinguish other writings from the authentick scrip+tures) willing mee to goe to the matter yt self / drawing by firme con|clusion / that nothing is to be allowed any place in the Church / which is not the perfect rule yt self in writing or without errour vttered in speach / and he wil yeild. This I did proue vnto him by an Argument hee was not able to answere / and did leaue out the word <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> thus. Only the Canonical Scriptures and liuely voice of Gods ow|ne graces are to be brought into the publick assemblies for doctrine and prayer: But mens writings or Collections are neither Canonical Scripture / nor the liuely voice of Gods graces in such as he hath ap|pointed to speake in the publick asse~blies. Therfore no mans writings may be brought into nor imposed vpon the publick assemblies for doc|trine and prayer.</P>
<P>Now where he cauilleth about the perfectnes of the rule and abso|lute perfectnes of the graces / it doth not help him: For the word of GOD being of necessitie by the lawe and ordinance of God / to be re|ad in our owne language / I trust he will not denye yt to be the writ|ten word of GOD for the vnperfectnes of the translation / being (to the best search the Church can make) skanned by the original tongue and stil amended / or at least the Church no further bound to yt / then yt shal be found to be the perfect rule: so likewise the liuely voice of GODS graces are not for the imperfectnes to be excluded / being Gods appointed ordinance / neither is anie fault in the translation to be allowed / and errour in doctrine or prayer are presently to be admo|nished and repented of. Maister Giffard then must denye the Bible translated into our owne language to be the Canonicall Scriptures / and denye the liuely voice of GODS lawfull officers / and such as are therevnto called / in doctrine and prayer / to be the manifestations of the Spirit and vtterance of Gods graces for the assemblie / or els grant the proposition firme: And if hee can put dead mens writinges into the place of either of these / I will yeild. In the meane time I hold such translations to be the worde of GOD / and by Gods ordinance put into our owne la~guage / to all our knowledges retayning the words of GOD / which word and the lyuely vse of Gods owne graces in the mouth of such as he therevnto appointeth / are only to be brought into the publicke assemblies for prayer and doctrine / for GOD hath com|manded these vnto vs as his owne ordinances in his assemblies / and no other means wherby either God speaketh vnto vs / or his people vn+to him / in the Congregation. To this all the Scriptures beare wit|nesse / the word is always firme / confirmed with miracles from hea|uen / and commended to vs by Christ / the Prophetts and Apostles / to be
<PB N="51" REF="31" MS="y">
the foundation / Canon / light / lanterne / etc. the graces of the Spirit gy|ven for the interpretation / prayer / doctrine etc. Christ is ascended vp into heauen / and hath giuen giftes vnto men to serve their tyme and minister in their place in this house. These graces stil renewed / not only in those called of GOD in this seruice for their dayly administra|tion / but newe workmen thrust forth into this haruest / as the Lord of the house disposeth: which graces of his Spirit are compared to two oliue branches / which emptie out of themselues thorow two golden pi|pes. Zacharie 4.12. And to seuen thunders which vtter their voices that cannot be written. Away therfore with your patched mass-boo|ke / yt may neither stande for a foundation in Gods house / nor for the lyuely voyces of these thunders: you make yt a monstrous Idoll by putting yt in either of these vses / yet you will make yt serve for both. Wee haue nothing to do with your matters of order / as you vndersta~d that order for tyme / place / etc. wee reason of the Spirituall action yt self / when wee entreat of the meanes whereby God speaketh to vs / and appointeth vs to speake vnto him. Wee can cast out the errours in the translatio~ or doctrine or prayer / and yet reeaine Gods worde in our owne language / and the liuely voice of his graces in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">assemblie: When you can do so with your deuises and newe hatched Leitourgies wee will giue eare vnto you and them / till then wee thinck of your coun+terfeit playes and pleas for your Idolls and detestable sacriledge and high prophanation of GODS ordinances with <HI>Iannes</HI> and <HI>Iam|bres</HI> to resist the truth. Paraphrases wee hold to be mens writinges and expositions / and not the word of GOD / nor the liuely voice of Gods grace of interpretation or prayer / therefore to be excluded this place of service vnto GOD. Thus you see the further you wrastle / the further you make your wares / the best of them / odious to euerie godly conscience. You say I deceiue the simple by gyuing them one crabbe amongst many apples: but you may behold your best apples such as the holy GHOST hath foretold vs <HI>Revelation.</HI> 18. to be entisements to euil: It is well you will grant my Propositions so sound: and I would wish (if such de GODS wil) they might be bet|ter sauoured.</P>
<P>Nowe because I wil not stand either repeating or contending about Syllogismes / I will take this much yeilded of your owne conclusions / which is as much in effect as I haue affirmed were you teach me thus to reason. No mans writings are the vndoubted truth of God / but haue errours and imperfections: therfore men cannot further ground vpon them / then they be consonant to the Canonicall Scriptures. A|gaine / The Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets: therfore our faith is not to rest vpon me~s writings. Where|vpon doth necessarily follow / that if mens writings may not be buil|ded vpon nor rested vpon / howe should you dreame it lawfull to im|pose them for lawes vpon the publick assemblies / or to haue them there read to beare rule as the wordes of God? And this you confessed
<PB N="52" REF="32">
in an other of your writings / that GOD spake vnto vs out of his vn|doubted worde / or by his owne word. If then GOD speake not vnto vs by mens writinges that be of priuate interpretation / in the assemblie / nor that they can be made groundwork to buyld our faith vpon / or to rest assured vpon / yt will be granted I hope that they are not to be imposed v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on the publick assemblies as lawes and ru+les / but left to euerie mans private vse in their libertie / as they will answere for themselues what vse they put them to / and whither they doe not prefer them before the booke of GOD / or preiudice themselves by them. This first poinct is then plaine / That only GODS vndoubted worde is to be imposed / brought in / a~d maintay|ned in the publick assemblies as lawes and rules / no other writings being authentick or Canonical.</P>
<P>But here Mr. Giffard doth in effect affirme / that the word of God yt self is not authentick or Canonical / except in the Hebrew or Greeke Copie: Wherin he goeth a litle beyond the Papists / that wil yet allow the worde of GOD in latine: And if it shoulde be defended / that the worde of GOD were not the worde yt self that wee haue in our ow|ne language / it will follow that no man could haue assurance of faith / except he vnderstoode both Hebrew and Greeke / yea be able soundly to interpret the Scriptures in both. If the translations be so far mens writings that yt ceaseth generally to be the word of GOD that is not written in Hebrew or Greek / and mens writinges not to be grounded or rested vpon / where shall our assurance stand? And might not Mr. Giffard as well say the Hebrew and Greek Copi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are but pa|per anky<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck / many faults and errours by the print in vowells / accents letters / and so conclude we had not Authentick or canonicall Scriptu|res at al / except mens erronious writings might be of equall authoritie in the assemblie that the Scriptures? must he not beare with mee in accompting him an Atheist or Libertine in thus reasoning? Hence then we see whiles you go about to abase the Canonicall Scriptures / and extol your patched Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tourgie you fall into manie blasphemies / as I haue before told you. Wee hold yt the word of GOD in what lan|guage soeuer / stil reiecting the errours in the print / in the translations etc. as they are knowne vnto vs / and not the word y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> self for the im|perfections or errours in the translation and print. Now when you can make that which remayneth the vndoubted worde of God / not agrea|ble only but an Authentick approued Canonicall Scripture / authori|sed from God to be the verie eternal foundation and rules / limitts and lawes giuen by himself vnto his people you may lift vp your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Dago~ into this place / if there be some truth in their writings (as what mens writings haue not some / and the holy name of GOD verie much) yet is that truth in the Scripture yt self and here so mingled with chaffe / that it were not only vnprofitable and a hinderance of the true vse of GODS worde / but an abolishing and defacing of the
<PB N="53" REF="32" MS="y">
word yt self / the maiestie whereof ought to terrifie you from this pre|sumption.</P>
<P>And where you say that you decide not controversies by anie transla|tion / but by the Authentick Copies of the Hebrew and Greke / I trust you speak only of such as are able by the interpretation thereof so to decide controversies / and holde it not vnlawfull for anie such as haue not that help / to convince errour by the powre of the word and confer|ring one place with an other in anie translation / according to the analo|gie of faith / though I grant we ought to vse the best approued. But if this were not lawfull surely no man might prophesie in the Church / which hath not the gift of interpretation of the tongue / neither might any affirme any Scripture to be true but they wich haue knowledg of tongues: How blasphemous is this g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are / whiles you are ignorant of the powre / wisdome and agreement of the word and Spirit and diuer+sitie of giftes giuen vnto men: The Word and the Spirit approue ech other / and beare w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ness ech of other / in what language soeuer GOD giueth yt / to our vnderstanding. Prophesie and knowledg of tongues are two seueral giftes not alwayes giuen to one member / but distribu|ted as God in his wisdome hath appointed. 1. Cor. 12. and prophesie commanded for the more excellent Cap. 14. But this is sufficient in this place / that the word of God is the word of God in what langua|ge soeuer / and to accompt yt being verbatim translated or at least so far foorth faithfully translated / mans writing / were blasphemie: but mens writings can neuer be so holden the authentick Scriptures of God / how agreable to the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> soeuer they be. My argument is then firme / and thus left vpon you: Those writings which be not the word of God being imperfect / and neuer without error / may not be imponed as la|wes and Canons vpon the publick assemblies / or there be read or inter+preted / or offred vp in worship: But such are al mens writings that be not the authentick word of God yt self&punc; The publick assemblies are on|ly bound to the reading and interpretation of the Scriptures / which God hath ordeined to be read in a knowne language / a~d for prayer and prophesie hath ordeined the liuely voice of his owne graces in the mouth of such as he hath appointed to be the mouth of the Congrega|tion vnto him a~d his mouth vnto the~. So that your patched Leitour|gie / paraphrases songes in rime / homelies / and al your dead mens wri|tings / are cast forth of the publick assemblies / and manifest to be Idols when they are thrust into that place.</P>
<P>Now where I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ledged that the binding of the publick asse~blie / yea of all assemblies / to certeyne writings of men euerie day and yeare their number and portion of words daylie mo~thly and yearely in al asse~blies the same matter and words reiterated in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead of powring forth their hearts vnto God according to their present needs and occasions was a setting of themselves in Gods seate and taking the office of his Spirit / which only knoweth the wantes of the seueral assemblies according to their diuerse occasions / he runneth away from the matter / as one vn|willing

to heare of this their <HI>Tautologia</HI> and counter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et babling / dema~|ding wheter euerie one should vtter their owne perticular wantes in the publick assemblie / or should pray nothing but that euerie one feeleth the present want of in himself / or should tell the Minister before hand what euerie one of their wantes were&punc; then how the Minister should re|member al. Are these any thing but m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re cauils? can any of these follow vpon the former doctrine? And let him looke againe / whether he that is the mouth of the Congregation vnto God in publick prayer / must not consider the present publick occasions of that publick assemblie / and thereafter frame his prayers / all the people ioyning in heart to his words of petition or thanksgiuing / saying Amen to so much as he as|keth according to the wil of God and neede of the time / yea and if they haue not feeling in such prayers / they are vnfeeling members: yet nei|ther doth he intermedle with private or secret wa~tes / neither neede they tell him them he is sent for the publick affaires of the Church / to com|mend the seueral actions general and publick / vnto God: And as they are diverse in everie assemblie / so must he be a ma~ of wisdome to know / see / and consider them / lest they al rashly step into the house of God to offer vp the sacrifie of fooles / and make a counterfeit babling Eccle. 4. Yet the sinne of this is nothing comparable to the do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng your Priests cast forth by pratling ouer your English Portuis / which the Lord will one day cast in your faces. As then in priuate prayer we are to lay forth our owne wantes and estate of our owne soule / which cannot be done by reading an other mans writings / alwayes singing one song / customa+bly repeating in superstition certeine words / our hearts neuer ripped vp / examined / nor the diseases therof layd open vnto God / seeking due cure: So the man that is the mouth of the whole assemblie prayeth / as the mouth of one bodie / for al their open publick present wantes and oc+casions: Which occasions / considering the persons and actions / are di|verse and cannot be written for one assemblie before hand / muchlesse for all assemblies in a whole kingdome / neither by man nor Angel. See the~ the mockerye of your service booke / and what Idolatrie is committed by yt / to the abandoning true prayer according to the present wantes and occasion.</P>
<P>The next thing to be co~sidered / is / about making of lawes in the wor|ship of God. Where he would persuade vs that their whole Leitourgie conteining al their publick worship / gouernme~t / offices and ordinances of their Church / be but matters of order and conveniencie. Then the compelling and teaching the publick assemblie to reade ouer mens wri|tings both as Cano~s and lawes in the Church / a~d publickly a~d priuate+ly to offer them vp in stead of true prayer a~d holy invocatio~ is a matter of comelines and conveniencie. In the meane time it must be a turning away of the whole order and ordina~ces of God: For what is the whole Testament of Christ but an order for euerie office / person / action in the Church / if he wil haue it taxis and then must confesse their Leitourgie an other order of publick administratio~ / and so as I haue said an other

And here|vpon I trust I may cal al this an adding to the word of God / yea I wil go a litle further / an abolishing and disabling and dishonoring of the word yt self and graces of his spirit. And whither all this smoke of the bottomlesse pyt may not be reproued with these Scriptures / not only Proverb. 30. verse 5.6. Deut. 4. verse. 32, but also Revel. 22. verse 18 19. let the godly ponder and search: and let the fearefulnes of the thre|ats deterre all flesh from presuming to alter the ordinances / lawes and worship of the most high God. And that the verie reading of an other mans writing for my owne prayer / or the prayer of the Church / in stead of powring foorth our owne hearts / is a changing of the who|le worship into the making mens writing an Idoll / which is by these places condemned as an accursed sinne: let the most hard text (as he in carnall wonder exclaymeth) be looked into Revel. 22. verse 18.19.

these? If Maister Giffard shoulde thus vnderstande the worde may hee is in the same fault to say the regenerate may sinne of frailty: And I answere furder / hee coulde vnderstand the worde <HI>may</HI> otherwise / if (as in all his writinges) hee caryed not this minde to take all in euil part / to quarrell / hee coulde have vnderstood it thus: that God suffereth of his elect to fall into such sinne / yet hee is able to reduce them by repentance / and hath made promise to receive them iff they retourne / and not haue cauilled in this maner in such thinges / the horrour in the verye naming of which sinnes shaketh the flesh and bo|nes of the godlye to heare or behold: so that his drift is but to cast in a litle wormewood / to deface the truth deliuered: Therefore I will onlye prooue the generall doctrine before affirmed / and for these perticulars / let him that taketh pleasure in raking in them / being sinnes not once to bee named amongst GODS children / answere himself.

<P>That GODS elect after regeneration doe fall into presump|tuous sinne / and for a time persist in obstinate sinne / and may bee re|stored by repentance / I thus prooue: Manie of GODS children may bee excommunicat / and vpon the repentance bee receiued agai|ne / as the incestuous person 1. Cor. 5. therefore do for a time remayne in obstinate sinne. Againe euerie sinne is to bee prayed for / but that one sinne against the holye Ghost 1. Iohn. 5.16. Therfore presumptuous sinne is committed of GODS elect after regeneration. That all presumptuous sinne is not sinne against the holy GHOST / wee shall see by the discription of that sinne Hebr. 6. and 10. where there is dispy|ting of the Spirit / accompting the blood of IESUS an vnholy thinge / persecuting the light they haue sometimes tasted of / and such like notes / which are degrees. further then presumption: for the|re is presumption of ignorance / of rashnes / of hope of mercy / and many times do the Prophets charge the people with rebellion against GOD: so that all presumption cannot have the curse <HI>maranatha</HI> pronounced vpon it / or the persons not to bee prayed for. But sure I grant / that presumption is neere to that sinne / and there cannot bee that high sinue without presumption. But now if all sinne but sinne of frayltie were vnpardonable / your Clergie were in a wo|full case / that thus maynely resist the truth / and persecute GODS servants.</P>

namelye / that the regenerat man cannot bee said to stande in bon|dage to sinne after regeneration / and the servant of GOD at the same time by outwarde profession / for none are in bondage to sin|ne after their calling to the faith / (to our iudgment) but suche as contynue obstinate in their open knowne sinne after due admoniti|on: that such stande not by outwarde profession the servants off CHRIST but of sinne / and are to bee excommunicate / hee wil|lingly granteth: and herevpon merueileth how I shoulde gather / that obstinat grosse sinners shoulde not bee excommunicat: which hee might playnlye perceiue if hee had eyes / for if al the regenerat bee in bondage to sinne / and so the servants of sinne and of Sathan / howe should they cast out an other for bondage out of their fellowship by the power of CHRIST?

<P>Againe / if all bee in bondage / then none can bee houlden without for being in bondage to sinne: so that none shoulde be excommuni|cat / none without / the worlde and the CHURCH / light and darknes / CHRIST and BELIALL should bee mingled together.</P>
<P>To all which hee hath made no answere / but demandeth certeine questions / and maketh such a formall conclusion / as if all were in bondage vnto sinne.

<P>Now for the 7. to the Romanes / the APOSTLE setting forth the strift betwene the flesh and the Spirit / speaketh somtimes in the person of the one (if I may so speake) and somtimes of the o|ther / somtimes of the newe man or regenerat part / or of himself so far as hee is regenerat: somtimes of the olde man / which is not wholly slayne / but ful of rebellion striueth for maisterie.

David feeling the gre|at assaultes of sinne in his flesh / and his inhabilitie to keepe the Lawe of GOD / earnestlye prayeth vnto the Lorde <HI>Direct my steppes in thy worde</HI> (saith hee) <HI>and let none iniquitie haue dominion, over mee.</HI> Af|ter the stronge man is cast out / CHRIST beareth the rule over vs and in vs / by his Spirit. So the scripture euerye where pronoun|ceth vs Saincts by calling / Kinges / and Priestes / a people set free / not that wee sinne not in thought word and deede howrely and daylie / but that sinne hath not dominion ouer vs: If then wee were in bondage to sinne / wee are the servantes of sinne and of death / which GOD forbid.</P>
<P>Where Maister Giffard therfore reasoneth thus: the regenera|tion is imperfect / therefore the freedome is imperfect / therefore there is some bondage / yt is blasphemie: For first our freedome is perfect in CHRIST / ells his death is not sufficient. Then though our sanctification bee not perfect / yet is there no bondage / but a rebellion of sinne: which if yt shoulde reigne / wee were not the servantes of CHRIST: And while it seemeth for a time to reigne / and wee obstinatly to cleaue vnto yt / wee are iudged (soe far as men can iudge) the servantes of yt / and so gyuen ouer from / CHRIST vnto Satan / till the grace of the Spirit againe to our iudgement appeare to beare rule.</P>
<P>As for David in the whole yeare after hee had commytted adulterye and murther / hee never pleaded for his sinne when hee was reproued not did no longer cleaue vnto yt. Soe likewise though wee fall and sinne / and bee ledd awaye with sinne / yet are wee not in bondage there|vnto / vntil wee obstinatly and wilfully give our selues vnto yt from CHRIST / which you finde not in the 7. to the Roman. but re|sisting of sinne / a hatred of sinne / a will to doe good / a repen|tance and contynuall recouerye of himself / and flying vnto Christ. Soe that your doctrine is false / to saye / the Apostle stoode in some spirituall bondage / and my Argument still firme / that these Ministers and people which stande in a professed bondage to a false governme~t / their praiers

are an abhomination vnto the Lorde / till they repent and submit them|selues vnto CHRIST and his lawes and ordinances. Whiche the Lorde gyue them grace to doe / euen speedely to depart out of the house of bondage / and from all subiection of his Antichristian Hierarchie.</P>
