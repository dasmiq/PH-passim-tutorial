<P>_AFter I had seriously considered how to pre|pare the Reader to receive this piece, with apprehensions becomming It's merit; I discern'd my selfe uncapable to contrive an Ornament beyond the noble name of the admir'd Author: When I have once intituled it to <HI>M^r Walter Mountague,</HI> &amp; assur'd it genuine, I conceive the Ex|pression imports an Elogie, above the designe and reach of the most alluring Commendation. 'Tis known, these Papers have long slept, and are now rais'd to put on that immortality, which nothing has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itherto de|pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d them of, but their concealement. They addresse themselves to the inspir'd and more refin'd part of men! Such as are capable to be ravish'd when they find a fancy bright and high, as the <HI>Phoebus</HI> that gave it: Such as have experienced those extasies and Rap|tures, which are the very Genius of Poetry; P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etry its selfe being nothing else but a brave and measur'd En|thusiasm: Such as know, what it is to have the Soul up|on the wing (suspending its commerce with clay) reaching a room almost as losty as the proper Scene of Spirits, till warm'd with divine flames, it melts it selfe into numbers as charming as the Harmony of those Spheres it left beneath it: Such as are thus qualified,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osorio.</SPEAKER>
<P>_WHat whisper's this <HI>Timante,</HI> that wakes our Prince out of his amorous slumber, and blows him thus abroad to seek for rest in agitation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Timante.</SPEAKER>
<P>This noyse, <HI>Osorio,</HI> hath past-by my eares; but judge you how unfit to be let into our beleefs. When it must be a woman's vertue that's of proof against such power, youth and honour, as our matchlesse Prince attempts with; whose repulse must counsell this retreat, and that cannot be, <HI>Osorio.</HI> Constancy would too much cheapen herselfe, should she impart such a proportion of virtue unto a woman, when the rarity of it in that sex, is that which hath raised Constancy to such a Vertue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osorio.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's a degree in vertue women may attaine to in their defence, that they retain even after they are taken: against Prince's assaults there's nought to be required but a neglect of speedy com|position;
<PB N="2" REF="5">
for taken as it were by assault, they re|maine with as much honour as women were born to. <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mira</HI> hath already made such a resistance, that it almost brings the possibility of Womens de|fending themselves against Princes, in question: therefore now even her surrender is a Trophie to her, and the gods owe the virtuous Princesse of <HI>Navarr</HI> that satisfaction, the dishonour of <HI>Fidami|ra</HI>; who, they say, quit her father's Court in a just disdaine, to marry one who loved another. I am sorry the Prince is guilty of an injury to so excel|lent a creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Timante.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say, <HI>Osorio,</HI> 'tis <HI>Agenor</HI> that inter|cepts <HI>Fidamira</HI>'s love to the Prince; 'tis surely fixt on him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Osorio.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be so, he is but justly punished, for having set him so, as all things must passe through him to Himself, if his own joyes be intercepted by the way; 'tis a strange fortune of a man, <HI>Timante,</HI> redeem'd from death by such a chance, as none can know who gave him life; one, whom but-forgetting, must have kil'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> preserv'd amongst the fury of a commanded extirpation of mortality; trusted to the rage of common Soldiers, who had pay'd so much of their own blood for this commission, as it was doubted whether they had enough left to exe|cute it. In this deluge, to see one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingle infant sav'd, was such a miracle to me, as I have not wondered at his succeeding fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Timante.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be, the Prince being a child then did beg his life: beleeve it, he was more to him then hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> father, as reviving is above begetting; and so loves him with such a supernaturall tendernesse, a|bove the fondnesse of a father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Osor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But look, <HI>Timante,</HI> where the Prince and <HI>Fimadira</HI> come: their looks me-thinks, imply so lit|tle
<PB N="3" REF="5">
peace, that even their sorrows seem to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntend for Mastery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Timante.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, <HI>Osorio,</HI> let's retire; we shall know what kind of storme these clouds containe.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>The Prince and Fidamira.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basilino.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentle <HI>Fidamira,</HI> forgive these looks and words that come in a morning to demand <HI>Albricias</HI> of you for the news; the use I meane to make of this my heavinesse, is, but to sink me down unto a levell eeven with you, that from thence you may receive your Equall not your Prince. I owe your virtue my conversion, for in persute of that which fled before me up to heaven for safety, my thoughts were raised thither, and detain'd; and were thus blest for following you, and their intent forgiven. So now I may justlier resume <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he name of <HI>Prince</HI> thus given by you; and yet preserve disparity be|tween us for my becoming thus a Prince proves you an Angell, and that prompts me to a demand which I dare aske, because it is the greatest blessing mortality can tast, and consequently you only can impart; and sure I was not destin'd to owe you lesse then all the good that you can give.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fidamira.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were sad before for one attempted in|nocence, I might be much more now, for this so generall injury to all our sex, in which Sr. you seem to exalt but a resistance of unruly wishes to that height of vertue our sex can rise to. Nothing can be call'd temptation Sr. to innocence, to make it selfe a way all's lost in the possessing; but such a vertue as should dare resist a Prince's fair and honorable love, when the yeelding is a victory, such a bravery of vertue were a subject worthy of your praise. To what a hight of contemplation would such a subject raise your soul, the which the preservation but of inno|cence hath carried even already into heaven?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basilino.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure <HI>Fidamira's</HI> vertue is not ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re such an
<PB N="4" REF="6">
extream; Virtue is allwayes gentle and pliant to the strength of reason. It weakens it selfe when it hardens in|to obstinancy. What reason can vertue bring with it, to justifie it's temper in the neglect of so fit an exercise of it selfe, as in a Prince his faire and vertuous love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fidamira.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must produce that which is above all Rea|son, faith either to the gods or men: virtue preserves her temper in the tendernesse of either of these vowes; nor can a Prince bring any reason that this virtuous tender|nesse may not or'eflow, and not resist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basilino.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith to the gods, <HI>Fidamira!</HI> 'Tis scarce a a good excuse for a dispaire: how can it then protect a froward contempt of all the joyes and blessings the gods ordain for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ose they represent themselves by? And Faith to men cannot be so religious as not to be subject to so high a dispensation. Might it not thus remit it selfe, even constancy might seem to be a sin. No <HI>Fidamira,</HI> the gods have not left such a temptation for Princes to repine, as the permision of such a frowardnesse to defeate their just desires.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">damira.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder not to see a Prince so much mistaken in this virtue, Constancy, that is so free as tyranny enlar|geth it. Princes should do well to prove it to be no virtue, since it may warrant disobedience to them, nor have You that call your selves the Images of gods, reason to repine, if, in your large commision, they have reserv'd the So|verainty of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r wills unto themselves. You then, young Prince, you that have inthroned your selfe among the gods, by the confinement of your wishes to be just; know there are none so, that would distresse, or much lesse break, a promised faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basilino.</SPEAKER>
<P>By these turning stepps I shall winde my selfe into an admiration, so as I shall not wonder at her re|fusall; 'tis time to goe directly to my wish. I am so hum|ble after my repentance, I do not bring my person, or my birth to claime a joyfull acceptation: but alledge your
<PB N="5" REF="6">
virtue and your beauty, to which you owe even some constraint to place them in such a light where they may be most conspicuous; which I can ple&agrave;d to be preferr'd by your making me happier then any other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fidamira.</SPEAKER>
<P>O how blessed am I, that have the means to make so brave a Prince happier then he can wish!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basilino.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more my <HI>Fidam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra.</HI> I will not exact a word more then is necessary for a consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fidamira.</SPEAKER>
<P>If, Sir, I must expound this happinesse unto you, you will not understand it at the first. Else know Sir, I love you so, I joy to think you may leave so new, and an unmatch't example of your virtues, as my condition doth afford you. Know Sir, I have deposited my faith, and have received a mutuall pawn upon it, and it must be your anger sooner than your love, that must release it. And, were it not a blemish to your innocence, even death would be an ease to mine: but pardon royall Prince even this little digression into a doubt of you. The gods that will not have your virtues call'd in question by a feare, assure me already you will, by a forgivenesse of me, possesse your selfe of a diviner happinesse then can be due by any acquisition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basilino.</SPEAKER>
<P>O do not mock me thus i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a submisse deluge of the sentence of the justest Heavens, in which you have an Angell's part to be the bearer of it. It is not fit, I should so soon be trusted with that innocence, I am so lately reconcil'd to; and Heaven will be so just to make the guilty fire of my lust, but-the-refiner of your virtue for another use. But I find Heaven mercifull in this, that it would vouchsafe me a miracle for consolation as well as punishment, that an accession of my love to <HI>Fidamira,</HI> should bring a patience with it to consent to this perpe|tuall distance you have pronounced; all merit to <HI>Fida|mira.</HI> In this separation from my selfe to this exalted patience, I disclaime, and owne my bad humanity in my affliction for my curse; but I will promise you the rest of
<PB N="6" REF="7">
my sad life to study this hard happinesse, which is not at the first so easily understood. But I am afraid the thoughts of you which must be alwayes mixt with my study, must keep it long obscure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fidamira.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that I were, young Prince, what you have call'd me but in my excuse, an Angell, that I might fly through all the quarters of the World, and with an Angell's voyce proclaime the yet-unheard-of virtues of the matchlesse <HI>Basilino.</HI> The grossest part of the earth, (where Love's so over-grown with flesh, 'tis not to be known,) would shake it selfe a pieces at my voyce; and Love abstracted, grown it selfe, would so remaine in emu|lation of your praise, Princes should owe you more then to their nature.</P>
<L>Which by the easinesse it gives them to out-do,</L>
<L>Makes the harder their out-suffering too&punc;</L>
<P>But your example would be a decision for them even in this. And for your part of happinesse, you seem not yet to see't. You must know, Sir, this is none of those light-colored joyes which fade and sully in the handling; this is one which wearing sets a glosse and lustre on. Which cannot decay but by your leaving of it off. And still the more you think on me, even those sad thoughts will be true shaddows to set off your joyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basilino.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must no longer, <HI>Fidamira,</HI> trust my infant-virtue against the growing strength of thy beauty which improves in this thy interdiction of them. I'le leave you, <HI>Fidamira,</HI> and without asking any thing, not so much as, who is that Subject, so much richer than his Prince by the consignement of your faith; And I doubt not but the heavens think me so fully punished as they will ne'r consent&punc; to the breach of this my vow, of ever being guil|ty even of the directest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olicitation of your love. And some auspicious deity antedeates this ease unto me, the beliefe that no other man shall ever injoy the matchlesse <HI>Fida|mira.</HI></P>

<P>Goe worthy Prince, and may you leave me all your sorrows.

And may you never remember me, till your glorious life, glutted with prayses of out-doing all your sex, may looke back on me for a more transcenden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">honour by this Mark, of how much you have out-done yourselfe, and so present you with an unhop'd for joy, which is the only retribution I can hope to make you.

<P>I have, my <HI>Basilino,</HI> been so affected with thy wishes, as when by the enquiring of my collected thoughts I could find no reason to approve of thy intended sepera|tion from us, I did addict them all to search for an excuse of the indulgency of my consent. And thou art so unhappy in thy birth as I have multitudes to satisfie, on whom wisdome it selfe can seldome have its operation;
<PB N="9" REF="8">
much lesse a naturall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dernesse can move against it.

<P>Hold <HI>Basilino,</HI> I made you thus a King, that you might have somewhat to give worthy a Father's asking, and that the deposition of this your wish might be by your gift to me, not my refusall of it. And now I do conjure you, <HI>Basilino,</HI> by the power of a King, that hath deposed himself, rather to pray than to command, to change this your desire of leaving us, into any other you can think of, and stay here; and by the gods we wish may move you; with us, the agreement to it shall be esteem'd a blessing to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basil.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that the angry gods would pitty me so much, that I might now obey you in a fatall silence. It is not a feather'd fancy that carrieth me to fly above my will, but a weighty misfortune that bears me down before you, to demand ease for my oppression, which I must have some time and distance to discharge my self of. Nor hath my curse been so defective in any circumstance, as to di|stract me quite, and so free me from the sense of all your interests; but it seems to admit an unsensiblenesse of all my own, to keep me wholly from the survey of you, whose contradiction of my ease is the refinedst torment. But I could provide, by engagement to you, Sir, against any important prejudice my absence may but threaten; if I might hope as well to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ighten that weight, I should else think too heavy to strive under. I could acquaint your Majesty with my arrivall, and my residence in every
<PB N="10" REF="9">
severall place, and by my promise to return upon any summons, should import but even your fears, secure you from any prejudice of my distance, which I would con|dition should not be out of the limits of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain.</HI> Now, <HI>Sir,</HI> have pitty of one whom you have rob'd of praise, by making him a King against his will; and this submission of my self unto your will, think a sacrifice worthy of a father and a King to value. And for your large offer, Sir, I am so reduced, I had but this one to ask of you, the which to ease you, I am content to deny my self.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agenor.</SPEAKER>
<P>The life of man protracted to a miracle were yet too short to tell the wonder of thy faith, much more that instant is but left me now for admiration of it. The Prince is instantly resolv'd to leave his fathers Kingdome, and hath obtain'd his leave. And hath chosen me the only partner of his thoughts, and his companion in his meane disguise. So as heaven finding thy vertue such as it might easily draw into a miracle, resolved to raise it more emi|nence by this farther tryall. And I for this their end am punished with love, and trust of <HI>Basilino.</HI></P>
<P>The time we had resolv'd for consummation of our wish|es we must now differr till our return. Sure <HI>Fidamira</HI> thou hast refin'd thy selfe so neere Divinity, thou art above the being enjoy'd by sense. And it were insolence in me to hope for such a temptation in this absence, as you have mett with, but even the love of Queens is not so impossible as my embracing it. The Prince's parting doth depend on nothing now but my returne. Which he is almost as impatient of, as I of staying here; which is a blessing I re|pine so much to leave, as I have need of't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fidamira.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a strange resolve, <HI>Agenor</HI>: there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rans|cendency in that young man above the fate of Princes, and could any action endear <HI>Agenor</HI> to me, it should be <HI>Basilino's</HI> trust. For the differring of our wishes, the oc|casion is so strange, it doth import the will of heaven.
<PB N="14" REF="11">
And for the tryall of my faith it is too easie, and assured a thing for heaven to intend, if heaven meaneth a miracle in mine, it must by it's intirenesse after the breach of yours which to me would seem such a miracle, I should not wonder though my own should be preserved for my affli|ction.</P>
<P>But this sad Digression hath no reason for it, but the distracted sense of your departure. Go then, <HI>Agenor,</HI> and serve that glorious Prince with such succesfull faith, as he may think, at your returne, not knowing of our loves by the opinion of thy faith, that nature meant our faith's only to match one another, and for improvement of our joyes, he may have his share in the bestowing them; stay not for any thing but for a confirmation of my wish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agenor.</SPEAKER>
<P>How opportune a blessing is this last command of <HI>Fidamira's</HI>? by which she doth appropriate my faith so solely to her selfe as she applyes my duty to the Prince as meritorious unto her, I can now serve the Prince with such a rare uninterested faith, it shall not wish for recom|pence, having allready more reward then he can give the will of <HI>Fidamira.</HI> Which the Gods keep for a re|ward of all his glorious deeds at his returne, in giving him but even as much to give to <HI>Fidamira</HI> as his consent unto her will. Which as the consummation of his glories, and our joyes, I must expect. And now by loosing of your hands, let fall this partition which they yet hold up.

What sayes <HI>Agenor</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agenor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do beleeve it, Sir, a curiosity worthy of an en|tire purpose. Therefore not to be omitted, lying in the way of our designe, which cannot be better begun than by the information of your selfe in such a variety, as all for|raign nations do admire, as it were a heavenly Institution that extends it selfe to all strangers, whose births are such, as may be worthy fortunes prosecution, and the distresse seeme so desperate as it may bring honor to the remedy. And this may prove, Sir, your neerest way unto your jour|neyes end, the forgetting <HI>Fidamira.</HI> For, sure Sir, beauty is soonest worn out of our memories by the imposition of new weight upon it, and so the last presseth away the former. And fame tellssuch wonders of this place, as sure it is rather a religious fear than your fathers guard, secures
<PB N="16" REF="12">
their solitude from the invasion of nations on the pretence of adoration. And it may be Sir, the gods will not in|debt you for so much as the composition of your broken mind, to any nation but your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basilino.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be Atheism in love, not change of my Religion; it must be that beleefe which I resolve that Beauty is but an Idea, not to be enjoyed but by imagi|nation; and by this Atheism must I be saved, <HI>Agenor.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agenor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ther's nothing, sure Sir, so impossible to be en|joyed as your enjoying this opinion long, unlesse you could refine your selfe into an Idea abstracted from your flesh. You must not only lose yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r memory, but all your senses, to retain this new opinion. Can you think, Sir, beau|ty was never enjoy'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Basilino.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, <HI>Agenor.</HI> There is no Lover's soveraign-fancy that will not confesse that Beauty is so set up, as 'tis even above his highest thoughts and to endeare his thoughts alleadgeth an impossibility of thinking height enough. Can our sense then, <HI>Agenor,</HI> get up such a pitch, where even our fancy flatts into an excuse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agenor.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are but Love's raptures, that somtimes carry beauty above sense. In any kind it were injustice to require of our senses the carrying of us above ground, when they were not ordained to flie. Their motion is towards fixt-materiall-objects, which they can reach, and are not bound to comprehend Lover's descriptions, that enlarge beauty into a spaciousnesse, where it loseth it selfe, because it cannot be compassed. Take this rule Sir, Sense is not bound to follow any thing out of sight, and within those bounds it can injoy all it meets.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Votorio.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ingenuousness of this institution is such, as we may joy we owe it not unto antiquity. It derives it self no higher then this King's grandfathers time, who had a daughter called <HI>Sabina,</HI> a Lady of that strange beauty and perfections, as this, was but one of the miracles she left us to admire her by. The virtue of her resolution takes off much from the wonder of her witt. Which seemes to have remain'd imperious and not flexible to her distresse. She was sought by two Princes, The Dolphin of France, and the Prince of Navarr: whose passions seem'd so equall, as the most powerfull could not beare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> deniall, and the weaker found himselfe so arm'd by his passion as he despis|ed the anger, which the power of France had vow'd a|gainst him, if he were preferr'd. <HI>Sabina's</HI> inclination to Navarr drew down the power of mighty France, upon this Prince of Vallance. But the hope of fair <HI>Sabina</HI> which he seem'd to think himselfe a gainer by, after the losse of most of his country. Then <HI>Sabina,</HI> whom it seemes the love of virtue only had made partiall to Navarr, found the way to exalt her virtue more, then by persisting a|gainst difficulties which seem'd to take off from the glory of it, by the abatement it procur'd where it intended an advantage. And so fearing left his sufferings might raise his virtues to such an estimation, as he might be thought to have<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d served her, and so the matching of herselfe might lessen her, resolved to take the glory wholly with the sufferings to her selfe. And so sent to the victorious Dolphin (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat had allready made himselfe Prince of Navarr, and bragg'd that with that title he would wo <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a</HI>) her promise that upon condition of his restoring Navarr unto the Prince, and swearing future, peace, she would never marry the Prince of Navarr. The Dolphin whose successe had nourished his love with hope even in <HI>Sabina's</HI> direct denialls, swallowed this as an assurance
<PB N="26" REF="17">
of his wish, without examining the words, beleeving his own flattering omen more security then even <HI>Sabina's</HI> promise. He accepted the conditions, and presently resto|red all his conquests though the Prince refused the treaty, and the future peace. Yet he instantly performed all that <HI>Sabina</HI> asked, who now resolved to publish the perform|ance of her vow. 'Twas sure the gods that did infuse these thoughts, for a reward of so supream goodnesse, and made the monument of her admiration a Sanctuary for distres|sed virtue, so to convey to future times a blessing with the memory of her. She begg'd of her father leave to make a vow of chastity and desired a propriety of this place as her dowre; which nature seemes to have made of such un|match't delightfullnesse, as if she had meant to brag, that she made a stage onearth worthy of <HI>Sabina's</HI> acting on this her divinest part.</P>
<P>Hither then by the consent of her indulgent father, <HI>Sabina</HI> came, attended by many Nobles of both sexes, whom love to <HI>Sabina,</HI> or admiration of the action brought with her. Of which she made this Order. And authorised by her father, erected this regall government, and enacted all the lawes you have heard read; which have been so inviolably kept, as a punishment here would seeme a won|der. She enjoyed the regality during her life, and then left the propriety of all unto the Queen. Who is eligible as you have heard. The peace and setlednesse of this place is secured by natures inclosure of it on all sides by impregnablenesse, as if it were only for chastity to make a plantation here. At one passage only, the rocks seeme to open a way of themselves, so as to let in the Kings care in a Garison. Which he maintains for safety of the place, which delivers all strangers to us as sutors, not invadors. Thus Sir I have inform'd you of the institution of the order of the Shepheard's, which is called by the Foundresse, <HI>The Shepheards Paradise</HI> As being a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> receptacle of distressed minds, and a Sanctuary against for|tun's
<PB N="27" REF="17">
severest executions. Now Sir, I must needs tell you the generous end of the Prince of Navarr&punc; that you may see, there was nothing accessary to this heavenly Institu|tion that had not such a transcendent newnesse of bra|very as they seeme made for such a divine novelty. The Prince as it seems hating the earth, whose safety had oc|casioned the losse of <HI>Sabina,</HI> In scorn of it forsook it, and came hither in a disguise.</P>
<P>And was admitted into the Order, where he lived con|ceal'd, and dying without making himselfe known unto <HI>Sabina</HI>; but at his death, left such a notorious memory as all ages shall study to display, and put it to the royallest ornaments can be due to Princes. The Queen ordained a particular ceremony to be performed every yeare at his Tomb, which is justly observed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moramente.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is so heavenly a tradition, as it be|comes best our delivery. This order seemes a match be|tweene love, and honor, and chastity, which you are hap|py sir in being the Preist to. But give me leave to wonder, why the brothers are excluded out of the election, which is to be guided most by beauty, of which sure they be the best Judges.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Votorio.</SPEAKER>
<P>The reason Sir, that I have heard was then given by the Foundresse, That it had been to have made them Judges in their own causes. Since there is none but hath a particular interest that doth prepossesse his choyce. Whereas all women are rather Inquisitors, then admi|rers of one another. And being voyd of passion, no freind|ship can incline them to yeeld priority in beauty. And so 'twas thought most probable, that where most of them agreed to yeeld, the advantage must be unquestionable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moramente.</SPEAKER>
<P>The wisdom, Sir, of the Foundresse was such, as it carries away our admirations, even with this our prejudice. I have one more satisfaction to desire of you, which the omission of, I do beleeve, in your opinion might render me unworthy of these I do allready owe,
<PB N="28" REF="18">
the knowledge of your new Queenes condition, and the time of her admission, with her pretence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Votorio</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis not above a yeare since she was received so, that, had she not had such a transcendent beauty, as might have endured the abatement of the envy, which so sud|daine an election might have taken from her, and even after that deduction have remained incomparable, sure she had not been chosen Queen. It was thought <HI>Pantamora</HI> the precedent Queen&punc; would have been relected. She is by birth a stranger, of some part of France. And brought with her marks of noble birth. Her pretention was an intention of her father to dispose of her to a person of great wealth and quality, who then loved another so passionatly, as the contestation with his father about his consent was so lowd, as the voyce of it came to the ladie's eares. Who moved, as she said then, with the true honor of her sex, resolved rather out of due to her perfections then pride of them, not to expose them to such an under|valuation, as the dispute of being enjoyed. Therefore left she her fathers house and repaired to this Sanctuary for protection of her beauty, which was in danger of pro|fanation. This was received of all as an acceptable plea for her admission, as a trium<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h that beauty had got by flying. She hath lived here ever since with so winning a modesty, as it hath so reconciled the plurality of the sisters to the strangnesse of her birth and beauty as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r chocie may be ascribed to an inspiration from above, rather then her aspiring thither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moramente.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may well ascribe it to the gods sir, the merit seemes to be so well proportioned to the reward and the sex is happy to have such an acquittance for the debt they owe to the Lady, as a Crown. We never met a greater tentation to uncivill detention, then the pleasing|ness of your conversation. Therefore wonder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> we cannot retire from you; we have two dayes yet to st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &amp; we shall waite upon you before our retreates from hence.</P>

<P>Had not my vow <HI>Genorio</HI> a much nobler ayme then my own, I might consent to let it fall here, and break even to humor thee, so little I esteeme my self.

But when I have cleared my selfe of that, then <HI>Genorio</HI> I will returne, even thither if thou wilt, with opened eyes, to let thee see my quarrell to my selfe is greater then love can reconcile, in living so unmoved with beauty, as <HI>Fidamira's</HI> sute to me shall not unsettle me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Genorio.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a rumor Madam when we came from Court, that the Prince to crown her virtue, and his wishes, had offered her marriage, which she had excused the acceptation of, by a pre-ingagement of her faith. And that the generous Prince resolving to vie with her for the braver fame, tooke this excuse with the humility of a pri|vate servant. And resolved to leave his father's Court; that at some distance from her, he might settle his re|solution of leaving her liberty, and taking his again.</P>

<P>This we have heard Madam, but dare not affirme as true,</P>

<P>Fame of it selfe charged with the weightiest things, is leight enough to be suspected; But carrying love's quarrels it growes incredible for thoughts to reconcile them, and so the truth which Fame set out with, may be changed, before it can arive. If this were true, though it were hard to decide an advantagious glory in this case to either of them, yet I should incline to recompence his sufferings with some ods of honor, since he is to enjoy her wish, and he nothing but the virtue of performing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers. What say you, ladies!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pantamora.</SPEAKER>
<P>As it is a strange virtue Madam must pre|serve faith so intire, when it may be set in a crown, as the losse of a corner would never be perceived: I confesse I wonder more at her, that might have had so large an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">asion for her faith as a Kingdome; than at him, whose
<PB N="34" REF="21">
kingdome being not enough to purchase such a faith, was then content with patient admiration of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Camena.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beleeve Madam, the Princes virtue hath re|sisted by farr the greater temptation: for her insensiblenesse might have justified his change, but even his constancy could not authorise hers. Faith must be set without a foile, so every blemish wil be visible. Should a Prince scratch, or deface a Jewell, while he kept it in his own hands, he might set what price he would upon it, but in the common estimation that would deprise it. So <HI>Fida|mira</HI> must have lost of her true value though the Prince had rated her as high as ever. So that she seemes to have preserved her value, and the Prince to have for her sake undervalued himselfe. Wherefore I should repaire him by allowing him the greater share of glory.</P>

<SPEAKER>Moramente.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all respect to the presiding Majesty, and honour to the blest society, thus I lay downe my misfortunes at your feet, which I find I put off, even as I now take on me here. And I begin to grow doubtfull of the justnesse of my pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence by a surprise of happinesse, which enters so fast my eyes, as I must fly back unto my
<PB N="43" REF="25">
memory in haste to bring out my sorrows. For I have such a new unluckinesse made of purpose for me, as I ought to feare that this joy breaks in upon me, but to car|ry away my memory, and with it, my pretence to this divine reliefe, and so to make this instant lightning a per|petuall storme. Now I must first addresse my selfe unto my own sex for judgment, in what you Ladies cannot be de|ciders for want of experience in it. Loving against scorn, I was so humble, as I had no scruple left in all my suffer|ings, but that of disappointing her I loved so well.</P>
<P>I could have wished that even her scorne had been pre|ferred before my wishes. So that I must excuse my con|constancy by Fate, since it occasioned such a fault in her, as this injustice you shall heare. In this continuation of my passion, which was so unhappy, I may now call it so, as to afford me many services done to her, which I will not expect so much reward for as their repetition. At last, fortune made one day my owne life, which was so contemptible to me the deliverer of hers, and the presen|ter of what punishment she should appoint the barbar|ous attempter. Whose threats had allmost saved the act|ive spilling of her blood, by that cold exanimation fear had drawn over her. Which notwithstanding did her that service, as to send forth some faint cries that guided me to the rescue, in a wood where despaire had carried me, to envy the life of plants, and to despise mine owne. There I found her on her knees, prepared to be a Sacrifice to that blow was moving toward her.</P>
<P>I, when I came to intercept it, (guilt is so weak, as tis no vanity to say,) I easily became as much master of his life, as he was of hers: and offered her to purge the ground, that had borne such a monster, with his blood. She then, I may say properly coming to her selfe, seemed to beg of me more earnestly his life, than she had don her owne of him; as if her soul had been allready carried up to heaven, and owght him this fright as a bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssing. I dis|arming
<PB N="44" REF="26">
him only, obeyed her. And gave him not only his life, but more then my own. When he was gone she told me she forgave him, since he had freed her from an inju|stice. Her life was only welcom to her, to retract her neg|lect of me. Which she would recant as farr as faith and honor would warrant her. I was impatient to know how far these limitations did extend Whether my wishes were shut out by them. She told me, the execution I had stayed was upon a condemnation, where I had witnessed a|against her, which somewhat qualifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the obligation, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t this p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rson, I saw ready to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the executioner, was one she loved so well, she had begged this as a blessing of him, the dying first, so to end with a perfect innocence, since his jealousy had resolved him to the death of both. And that he had so much disputed this request a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had gi|ven me time to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the suspend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of this judgment. There|fore that I should not wond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r if she was tender of his life, that had so lately give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her more then his own. For that she could not have lived after him, and must have died with the guilt of her own hands&punc; the innocency of whose heart would be sufficiently proved to me, by the knowledg that it was of me only she was accused&punc; Therefore bid me weigh the merit of my action, with my unhappinesse in the occasion I wondered to see my selfe indebted, even after such a present, as two such lives unto her. Therefore acknowledging my misfortune, ascribing this releese to her chance, begg'd of her some command, whose perfor|mance might absolve me from the fault of my contribu|tion to this distresse of his, with promise to undergoe whatsoever she should promise a full forgivenesse on. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n she with as much security as rigor, condemned me to more then I had freed her from. And told me that this mistake of her intended executioner did not so much a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at her passion to him and could much lesse dispence with the engagement of her faith. Therefore commanded me ne're to see her more, and so rest contented all my life with this
<PB N="45" REF="26">
joy of having made her happy. After this hard command, to soften it, she steept it in such teares, as I grew rather ashamed, then resolved. Then she began to prayse, and magnify the bravery of this my action. So as I was afraid to heare her long, lest vanity should seem to share with love, in the perswasion to this obedience. I gave her instant|ly my promise of complying with her will, and to adde somwhat even to her own wish, I said I would conduct her to her servant, and never more but once againe accuse her of cruelty. And joy, that my accusation of her might now prove meritorious to her. And this settled in peace, and confidence with him, I should make him witnesse of my vow, so to secure her future joyes. This I did the same day, and so left her there, where she began to be sensible of my company. And resolved to repaire to this Sanctuary with so much devotion to forgetfullnesse, as nothing but the hope of my admission here, could have perswaded to the repetition of this story. Which if it do procure me, I may triumph over fortune. Whose depression of me hath but sunke me to the center of rest and peace.</P>

<P>How unsure are the calmest harbors, mortality can ancor in? Fortune hath raysed a storm for me, that drives me out even of this security, and makes the ex|posure of my selfe to the wide Ocean of the world again, a wished-for safety. My sinking here now is inevitable, and this safe descent is more unsufferable to me then striking on a rock, and so to perish with preheminence&punc; The sad mis|fortune which admitted me into this sanctuary is so out|weighed by this that falls on me now, as even this place that did releeve me then becomes my persecution. Here I found ease for all the paines, that spitefull death, by his cursed seisure on my love, inflicted on me: but here is none for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xtinction of my power, whose seperation from a noble heart if it be consolable, becomes the greater curse. In the remission of its selfe it must consent in yeelding un|to comfort. Love is not such an irremediable passion as ambition. Love when it goes least annihilates it selfe, and so becomes its own remedy: ambition yeelds not to re|pulse, but scales up again as often as it is thrown down, and so is lesse relievable All the comfort I can admit of, is, that my vexation doth so new a thing, as to defeate the peacefull virtue of this place; though that will be much abated by the necessity of dissembling my discontents.

<P>As love, <HI>Camena,</HI> seiseth all our senses, it keepes all their faculties so busied, as they have not lei|sure to tast, much lesse to enjoy any thing, and when our senses have prefer'd it up into our thoughts, there it is inthroned higher, than any mortall joy can reach up to depose it. Love may rise to this transcendent height, that it may seem to look down on all things, and despise even enjoying: but, likely, our thoughts in this elevation stay not long, but growing dizy fall. Therefore when our imaginations settle at such a pitch, as our senses are within distance of them; then possession is a foundation to maintain Love at that height: and such love, <HI>Camena,</HI> remaines unmoved, and seeth the ruine of many aspiring passions that fall down by it.

<P>The very introduction to my story, Ladies, may be a pretence enough unto your pitties, that I am redu|ced to begg beleefe of you in that&punc; which above all things derogates from your selves, That your contrariety could be beloved. And that which will avert you Gentlemen from the credit of it, is, that it may seem a scandall to have this love imputed unto men; unto whose colours this of mine may seeme a staine, and not an ornament. Thus I am so miserable as before I plead my cause, to make my judges justly parties against me; but, this wonder past, and pardoned, then the consequence may easily be beleeved because it is successively naturall, A Father and a Son being the subjects of this wonder. The passion of the son was first. The father followed it unknown to the son; of which the father meant to apply the first discovery, only to benum and dead what was left of life. This was that only pretence which the fury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ealousy, did allow the son&punc; which had perswaded as it seemes the father, that the blacknesse of his thoughts would match the colour Na|ture had ment to sute with mine. And the gods know, I was so equally averse to both, as they had made our co|lours The fathers purpose seemed to him past defeat; and finding me one day so constantly unmoved with all those stormes lover's complaints do raise, at last this swelling sadnesse broke into a rage, and v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wed rev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nge. The which the strangn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sse of, might be discr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in my be|leefe, had not the wonder of his love presaged unnaturall events. He said, he would reduce himselfe to a condition should defeat even my pitty, and in revenge of my crosse-will would frustrate even my power of helping him. And there he seemed to prove, this purpose was designed above, since nature had curst him unto the making of his curs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, his son. Whose making was not thought enough, but his
<PB N="55" REF="31">
end too was destined to him, and even for such a cause, as was a greater torment then the act. Therefore he said, his thoughts condemned his son of more then parricide, his intercepting of my love to him, and he should be sacrificed to this suspition. So little did the love of twice himselfe prevaile, set by his love to me. And this he said, he did acquaint me with, that my virtue which had been his tormentor, might have the paine of being the cause, and knowing this detestable effect without the meanes of a prevention, which his instant execution should make im|possible. And thus he seemed to fly from me, as if the plea|sure of this act already had displaced that of his being with me. Then I, counselled by virtue in this strange surprise, which seeing as her self she had not power to divert this rage, did prompt me to disguise her into a shape might please his fancy for a while, and so delude this fury by its own resemblance. Then I persuing him with haste stayd him, seeming to embrace his rage, not wrestle with it. Then I told him that I did allow this brave resolve, as a temp|tation high enough to justifie my yeelding to. And I could never have thought to have mett a humor worthy the matching mine unto. I told him, mine was none of those warme tender hearts that sighes could blow into a flame. It had an adamantine temper, which only blood can soften; and that he had done like to that Painter, that had the figure of a lyon running mad, and wanting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">othing but the foame to represent, grew so distracted with despaire of hitting it, as in a rage he threw his pen|cil at it, and by this chance did rarely perfect his aban|doned worke: and so his fury had, throwing it selfe into so high despaire, made up that figure, which only could have taken me.</P>
<P>I told him, that his feares were true, and that his son was guilty of interposing between him and me. But his offence was only naturall, not active against him, whose having of a son, had resolved me, not to submit the plea|sures
<PB N="56" REF="32">
of my bed to a minority in any thing. Therefore he that could intend to kill his son to impossibilitate his joyes, will easily do it to assure them. Which if he would promise, on the beleefe of his brave minde, that had ad|vanced me to such proofes of it, I would advance his possession of me, even this night, before the ceremoniall rites. He agreed to this with so much joy, he seemed to have made and not destroyed a son. That night, I ha|ving taken up the time on such a pawne as this, made pre|sently the best of it, and layd it out so, as I thought the use of it should pay the principall. Therefore I sent in|stantly to the son; and, by tokens, that I had taken from the father as pledges of his word, assured him his death was purposed by his father, and that night. That there did remain no time for any thing but flight. This he be|lieving did fly instantly. Which I assured of, my next part was now, to unmask my virtue, whose vizard grew offen|sive. Therefore thus winged with innocence, I did resolve to fly over these seas, which part our neighbouring lands, leaving a Letter which might clear my virtue, from that black engagement I had made. And coming hither, the kinde gods presented me with the selfe equall report of so divine a body, as it offers it to the releife of all nations &amp; sexes, and my arrivall here I cannot ascribe to lesse then a divine direction.</P>
<P>Thus have you heard a Story, whose strangenesse needs so much of your pitty, it must first aske your credit as a charity; which if you do vouchsafe, I cannot doubt a fair commiseration. And the newnesse of this my pretence brings somewhat with it, as a recompence for my admis|sion, an enlargement of the powerfull vertue of this place which by receiving me into this happiness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, shall shew, it cannot only disappoint Fortune's malignity, but Nature's too.</P>

If this pur|posed remove of thee out of thy Fathers house did shake thee into needless fears, 'twas thy humility, that did not know, that thy transcendent merit was so much, that a King could not spare the smallest circumstance in all his power to honor it enough.

<P>Kind pilgrime, In the absence of my son, jealous of, so much comfort as my care, my cursed fate guided her the only way unto my guilt, her flight. I do not think her dead, no more then a disguise may be a preparation to it. As death may have a better pretence to seise her then as not her selfe, than in the lively illustration of her selfe, to whom all lives are due. And to let thee see, kind Pil|grime, how due to me this thy ingenuous yeelding was, I will direct thee to an ease of all thy miseries, while mine are unreleevable. I'le terminate thy aimelesse course, and point thee out to such an end, whose sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e attainder shall center thy sorrowes up in rest. You have heard sure of the Shepherds Paradise, whose peaceable bounds have that strange virtue from the gods, as to include all those within a peacefull acquiescence, that are admitted there. Thither repaire, for though you have not griefe enough to weigh with mine; yet your misfortune's full enough for a pretence to be received even there. And when you finde the smiles of that smooth place laugh at your wrin|kled sorrowes past, then for my sake dispute your joyes with those contented soules.

<P>The gods be with you Sir, and may you live to be a wonder in the contrary extreame of what you now are. Alas, good King, how patient have I been to allow your sorrowes victory, striving with mine, which these were too that you brought forth. For <HI>Fidamira's</HI> flight belongs simply to me, and hath no comfort but the ad|miration of her virtues, which this happy meeting with the King hath so exalted as the wonder mingles with the sense of my disappointment, and so tempers it into a hopefull patience. The kings counsell is so good, it will serve for more then he intends it, and I hope for as much joy to him, as he meant ease to me. I will goe back direct|ly to the Prince, and now assure him that the Princesse of Navarr is dead, to stop his fathers course. And as I finde his thoughts are fixt or moved from <HI>Fidamira,</HI> so con|trive his returne; the which will quickly unconceal my <HI>Fidamira,</HI> who must needs be hid in some neighbour|ing privacy secure from her virtuous feares.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mora.</SPEAKER>
<P>As it doth intend, Madam, all good should rise to its perfection, our minds are but love's pupills at the first. Which fit themselves but to proceed and take degrees, and so our second love is a degree wherein our soules at|taine to experience that imploys it selfe in loves refine|ment.

<P>I will allow you <HI>Moramente,</HI> Love is no irradiation of a light into our soules whose first instant brightness is in its perfection. But may not the first spark be kept alive and raised unto as high a light, as can the second, which is kindled still by putting out the first?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tis not an extinction of the flame, 'tis but a change of the materiall that fomented it: so second loves have this advantage, they being the first instant in that height the first was long agrowing to, and have the first comparison to rayse themselves by, which must prove it higher by having got above it.</P>

<P>These degrees of elevation <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ramente,</HI> you require in Love, inferr this consequence that love should be a con|tinuall motion, by change aspiring to transcendency.

<P>In this degree Madam, which I have named Love comes to touch a point, after which all motion is a decli|nation. I do not allow loves leightnesse, or variety con|tributors unto its heighth.

<P>What <HI>Moramente</HI> sayes, <HI>Martiro</HI> seemes to justi|fy the Prince his second love, and so to make his cause a president to plead his own by, since their fortunes do re|resemble much in the miscarrying of their loves.</P>

<PB N="73" REF="40">
so, as men may feare the being loved, and women may justly leave from loving, since nothing but dying can shew that they can love enough. Behold and pity me whom death keeps thus alive by my despaire. In living to proclame his Triumph, not only in my love, but in my life, I am that wretched he, that shame unto my sex, that was beloved by such a one, as had not sin enough to dy, but death was faine her virtue to imploy.</P>
<P>This treachery did death use me with, whilst I was as I may say even in his company, as much as darknesse and absence represent him. In this separation then, death I may say betray'd love too: for 'twas the deadly sinn of lust, armed with the power of a Prince that did assault the vir|tue of this matchlesse Shee. To save whose life she gave her own to death delivering it with her own hands. Which being not strong enough to defend her innocence, were innocent in the defeate of her own life when it stood against her innocence. After this, do not be|leeve that I pretend admission here for comfort, but bound to seeke through all the world the place which is the truest enemy to lust, and death, which all consent is this; for that virtue which defyes the first, defeates the last of his power. Therefore I must implore your ayde in this, that in revenge of this injurious life which nature is not so kind as to allow me hope of a justifiable freeing of my selfe of, I may live here where only life is such, as it despiseth death.</P>

<P>The tendernesse of friendship Madam, is the best constitution of it, and misfortunes that fall first on friends have not their weight broken by the way, but fall heavier as they bring them down upon us.

<P>These, Madam, I dare commend more, as they concern me not so much. I'le read them to you, Madam, in the person of the Prince upon the death of the Prin|cesse of Navarr.</P>
<L>Having allow'd my sorrowes choyse of paine,</L>
<L>They have chose this, the searching still in vain</L>
<L>The cause of this strange death, and though on earth</L>
<L>I find more reason for't, then for her birth,</L>
<L>As curses are much more then blessings due;</L>
<L>Yet that doth not seem strange enough for new.</L>
<L>Methinks heaven's wisdom needed not disburse</L>

<L>Doth justify resuming of his grant:</L>

<SPEAKER><HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe Madam, the having made her self away must needs lessen much his devotion to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rtues; nor do I believe that e're he meant to love her; but moved with a religious sense of those hazards of hers he was accoun|table for, did vow this search for expiation, not expec|tance of her love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, love is very injorious, or it is injured much by mens complaints; for, since my comming hither I have heard no pretence to a misfortune, but Love hath had the imputation of it. Sure you know what Love truely is; therefore instruct me what in it selfe it is, that ne|ver heard of it but c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iminated with sad effects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moramente.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall retract all my complaints if I be so happy as to be the first, that informs you Madam what love is, and shall doe so great a service unto Love it selfe, as it hath but one recompence great enough for my re|ward.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="42">True Love, Madam, is a Spirit extracted out of the whole masse of virtue; and two hearts, so equall in it as they are measured by one another, are the vessels where it is refined, heated naturally by each others eyes, and joyn|ed by pipes as subtill as our thoughts, by which it runs so fast from one into another, as the exchange and the re|turne are but one instant. And to confirme this doctrine, you Madam by this receit may make it when you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bellesa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The reason then that I have heard Love cal|led a poyson, is, when this Spirit is intended to too high a degree of heat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mor.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be drawn from good ingredients, it cannot rise to an excesse. Pure Love is a virtue Madam that hath no extream; and wild desires take but Love's name, as rash blasphemers do repeat the gods by an habitual sinne, by which they only do prophane themselves. It is desire, Ma|dam, you have so oft heard called poyson. 'Tis true, that's a mineral which if it be not well tempered and prepared, is very dangerous; but, so disposed, it quickens the virtue of all it mixeth with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Me thinks <HI>Moramente</HI> you conclude, There must be a conformity of two hearts for Love's composure, &amp; so a single one that gets not another to joyn with it cannot attain to Love's perfections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Loves perfection Madam, is such a blessing as the gods have, not left in the power of any one to consum|mate&punc; but, to indear it by the difficulty, have ordained it should depend on the consent of two. This rarity in na|ture else, would prove too cheap if every single heart could be possest of it. Therefore I conclude that loves per|fection must be such a compacted union of two hearts so close, as there's not so much as even a wish left out be|tween them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can this be done? For I have heard most women say, that when our hearts are softned so as they are impr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssive, then men thinke themselves their sove|raigns,
<PB N="78" REF="43">
having set their Image on them; and so our hearts are rather wrought into subjection, then that equal union you describe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confesse, Madam, there may be men as vain as wo|mens fears: but, vanity though it take many marks upon it selfe, yet leaves but seldome any. It is so light, Love ne|ver feels it as it passeth over it; therefore Madam, Vanity doth but polish Love in its own conceit, and so sees it self in it, and pleaseth it self with the reflex without the im|pression left. But a mans heart possest with true love as soone as it perceives but the least gentlenesse, where it is applyed to move, then with humble insinuations it works it self under that heart, it means to raise in this injection of it self into it; so that the womans heart is not subjected but exalted by this union.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bellesa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You conclude then <HI>Moramente,</HI> that all love is a desire refined into the parity in union; and I have heard <HI>Martiro</HI> say, Love's soul was made of the impossibility of union: How can these two be reconciled?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard of men so long immured up in darknesse, they began to make a sight out of the habit of privation of it: and so despaire at last may thus suppose it self a light, and custome may delude it, and such darke visions Madam are better wondered at then intended to disprove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confesse <HI>Moramente,</HI> I incline more to your opi|nion, as the more clear by far. <HI>Martiroes</HI> lessons are yet too hard for so young a beginner as I, I shall acknowledge my self your pupil as the first I ever understood Love by. I hope you will come abroad now. Pray give me this paper, left it make you fall into a relapse.</P>

<P>You are a greater Mistrisse in love Madam then you know of: for I have not told you half of that I have heard of you, the repetition of which would ease me more then the repetition of all other griefs. I have so desperate a disease, Madam, I cannot hope for a relapse.</P>

<P>I believe <HI>Moramente</HI> (for so I now must call you) this place already hath furnished you with such an antidote as you might venture to seek out <HI>Fidamira,</HI> and defie the power of her love. You may much lesse then, ap|prehend the danger of the place, from which she hath now removed all virtue, your father's Court.</P>

<SPEAKER>Moramente.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? is she gone from thence <HI>Genorio</HI>? didst thou call her <HI>Saphira</HI> mistrusting my obligation of a sorrow great enough for her? or hast thou plagues in store for me, and dost produce them thus successively, left over-charged, I should break all in pieces?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Genorio.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>Moramente, Fidamira</HI> is not dead. She is only frighted from your fathers Court by the feares of too conspicuous a life, to avoid the guilt of others sinns, rumor, and calumny; and guided by her virtue, that was shie even to a degree of wildnesse is fled, and whither known only to the gods: your fathers search hath proved that she is hid from all mortality, his care hath been so exquisite.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Moramente.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am confident she is not dead by this <HI>Genorio,</HI> I could not have beene so long suspended from the sense of such a curse. She's not so much as strayed, for the gods must needs guide her in a journey they have sent her.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Genorio.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me thinks, you should not name the gods without remembrance of the bonds of nature, and of pie|ty you stand ingaged to them in, to relieve your father; whose tendernesse of all your prayers sinks under the pres|sure of a fresher griefe than your unhappy absence, the flight of <HI>Fidamira.</HI> His goodnesse is such he feares more your imputation of it to the forfeit of his promise, then he fears all his present sorrows.</P>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat sets her so neer the celestial bodyes, as it can allow her for low mortality but such a love as there is, which is but titular, and propitiatory, far above all propriety, which undeifies all we adore. I would not have her bow neerer the world then all the worth of it can set it self to her, which is so far from rising to equality, as it can scarce get height enough for comprehension of her. Therefore I cannot consent that any thing but souls should e're ap|proach her, and they so purified as when they rise to hea|ven.

<P>Now I must aske your pardon, <HI>Genorio.</HI> This is a devotion which I yeeld to at first sight, without examin|ing how much you are addicted to it. Look here <HI>Ge|mella,</HI> here's a face that makes your colour better then mine as you cannot blush to see it.</P>

<P>As beauty is best exalted by comparison, you Madam may receive this as a devotion to you, but I be|lieve all beauty is so assuredly your trophy, as 'tis no me|rit to bring any to you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will read them to you, Madam.</P>
<L>I'le ask no more love's strangest rapture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> why</L>
<L>They speak so much impossibility</L>
<L>Since love hath taught me to beleeve, and prove,</L>
<L>It is the essence of transcendent love.</L>
<L>To make even love corporeall, and subsist</L>
<L>You must allow't a soul that may resist</L>
<L>Reason: and wonder needs must be that soul,</L>
<L>For nothing else can reason so controle.</L>
<L>If grosse materiall love do then aspire</L>
<L>So high as wonder for a soul, then higher</L>
<L>Must that spirituall and sublimate,</L>
<L>That's not extracted out of will, but Fate,</L>
<L>Derive its soul, and higher must imply</L>
<L>Then wonder needs, impossibility.</L>
<L>Since then pure love will take its soul but thence,</L>
<L>From whence is vilified our noblest sence,</L>
<L>This sets supreamest love above event</L>
<L>And proves all sensuall lovers impotent.</L>
<L>My love's not that materiall flame,</L>
<L>That's let but by attraction from the same.</L>
<L>It is a lightning in my soule, which is</L>

<PB N="96" REF="52">
<SPEAKER>Mor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I conceive your meaning <HI>Martiro,</HI> that since all love must have a soul as high as wonder, some may rise as high as impossibility: this, Madam is a point of faith, not to be disproved by reason, because it denies all principles in love. I would onely ask <HI>Martiro</HI> whether his love did not passe first through his senses up to his imagination; and so the impossibility of staying there, conveyed it where now it is pitched; and it was necessity, not choice that drew it up so high.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>Moramente</HI>: My love had ne're so low a thought as hope, it rose within my soul which did dis|daine alwayes to wish for any thing out of its owne pow|er. I never did expose it to the hazard of a wish, the na|ture of it was Angelicall, at first infinite, without need of propagation.</P>

<P>Vouchsafe me a word <HI>Gemella.</HI> What injury did you foresee I would do you, that you would advance me such a discourtesie?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gem.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I may assure you <HI>Genorio,</HI> I did not suspect any injury from't. I would certainly have forgiven you if I had, and not have been in danger of revenge which this

discourtesie I know not of, might by a carelesse innocence seem to resemble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seemes indeed you did not care so much whe|ther it were true, or no, when you told the Queen I was in love with <HI>Fidamira,</HI> since you could not so much, as guesse by any thing you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gem.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I had said, she had been in love with you, you might have been offended at such a temptation unto va|nity, considering her story. But I thought the Queen's opinion of the Picture would have indebted you to me for such a choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think <HI>Gemella</HI> that any face, even with a promised faith to help it&punc; could defend it selfe against <HI>Bellesae</HI>? Could you think then that a Picture could have life enough, even to remember what it was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe <HI>Genorio</HI> faith much more lovelier then beauty: and it must needs be so; since all beauty doth but aspire to it, and 'tis the greatest Miracle beauty can wish, creating more then it selfe, which it doth producing faith. I would not allow all the worlds beauty to contest with <HI>Bellesa</HI>; but I should preferre the least faith before all her beauty my face with such advantage might dispute with hers.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gem.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis of a strange nature <HI>Genorio,</HI> 'tis onely pre|tious kept, not given away: as soon as we would lose it; to transferre it annihilates and becomes nothing, to show us, that as soon as we intend its prophanation, it can pu|nish us, by leaving us onely an impotency of having any, instead of the power we would take to dispo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do confesse <HI>Gemella,</HI> all passions but love break faith, as they carry it from one unto another: but that may convey it as intire as spirits may be powred from one glasse into another without losse of virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="98" REF="53">
<SPEAKER>Gem.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true <HI>Genorio,</HI> when love begins to work up|on it to transferre it, it ceaseth then to be in us; and there|fore love would disguise the losse of it by the pretence of our disposing of it: when indeed there is no faith left, but the believing love, by which we seem to justifie our infide|lity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you censure one of infidelity that should but change his invocation, to raise his devotion up to a more dignified, and glorious Saint? why, <HI>Bellesa</HI> is the supremacy itselfe of love, and all appeales are due to her from all love's lower seats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me-thinks <HI>Genorio,</HI> it were an injury to such a Judge to appeale upon confession of a perjury. Think <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">norio,</HI> what a sentence you can expect, when you are so bold to bring guilt to plead for you. I perceive you did love <HI>Fidamira,</HI> and now you would bring your broken faith unto <HI>Bellesa,</HI> as a scarre you have received in her ser|vice, by which you would pretend reward. Suppose she should receive you into love's Hospitall, faine charitable pitty; this were all the preferment you could hope, to be entertained to praise her goodnesse, if she forgive the crime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>My crime to <HI>Fidamira</HI> must needs be meritorious to <HI>Bellesa</HI>&punc; and Me-thinks I cannot feare any thing so low in love with her as all that I could hope with <HI>Fidamira.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mark <HI>Genorio,</HI> how you are already punished for your inconstancy, in your own choice of an assured tor|ment; for 'twere a derogation from her not to believe it; and consider what an affliction it will be to you to be the first that must make her a curse to any thing. And I con|fesse I cannot pitty you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>O say not so <HI>Gemella,</HI> I was resolved to beg more of you. Do you think I would have cast away such a secret without the hope of a returne? I have lessened that to you, which you call sin, the breach of faith, by ha|ving so intire a one of your virtue and honour as to trust you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="99" REF="53">
<SPEAKER>Gem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, <HI>Genorio,</HI> is all the beauty nature hath be|stowed on me; and I am interressed as much in her disfi|guring, as handsome women would believe themselves obliged, not to protect a man, that had by violence defa|ced one of that company.

<P>I do believe you so generous, <HI>Gemella,</HI> as even an injury done you would not discourage me, from a pre|tence to courtesie.

<P>I will already be so charitable, as to prevent your saying that, which must oblige me to a contributi|on to your misery. You may know by this, I understand what you would ask of me: I will forget it, and leave you, and onely tell you my fears, and not my wishes in your fortune. You shall live to see your wishes so enjoy|ed, you shall not dare to own them. And you shall so repent this your sin, your sad contrition shall be such, it shall not hope forgiveness when you see your Judge, whose sight shall, notwithstanding, make your wishing it, a well proportioned torment.</P>

<P>You suppose then <HI>Genorio,</HI> I love, and with successe. I did not think I had been so neer a happi|nesse as even a friends mistake.

<P>Nay sir, I am so confident of your fate, as I dare refuse your beleefe in the discredit of it. I can disprove you by instinct of nature. <HI>Bellesa</HI> and you have an Identity in your beings, you are the perfection of both sexes, and therefore cannot be a verse to one another.</P>

<P>I thought how probable your guesses would prove, <HI>Genorio.</HI> Why, they are grounded on a parity with <HI>Bellesa:</HI> you could not have found in all the world such an impossibility to have inferred my good fortune by.

It alters so, as we should not know it were the same, did we not know that it must change. And time, that changeth all things, is it self by fortune changed in this general earth-quake.

<P>'Tis I then for being constant among all these chan|ges am unnatural, this was the miracle <HI>Agenor</HI> prophesi|ed at our parting.

<P>Vanity Madam sees by the emission of its own rayes, not by the reception of the object. And therefore may not only reach most distant lights; but, as it were, strike fire in the dark.

<P>Love, Madam, appropriates what it joynes unto it selfe, and doe you think a partner in the sove|rainty of your selfe were not halfe a deposition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gem.</SPEAKER>
<P>This insensiblenesse you counsell <HI>Martiro,</HI> is ra|ther an admission to equality, leaving all hearts free, and <HI>Bellesa's</HI> can be no more it selfe. Tis an enlargement of her soveraignty to take homage from such hearts as shall bow down to offer it. If you will give selfe-love <HI>Martiro</HI> the empire that women should glory in, how limited will that be when they shall have no subject but themselves? All I counsell the Queen is, that she would know her selfe too. For beauty sees it selfe best, by the re|reflexes that it makes on objects whereon it shines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>A heart that looks at first for so much from the Queen as an acknowledgment, sets too high a price upon it. Should every meanest subject pretend to have his name known to his Soveraign because he is what he should be? It must be some eminent service must allow him that pre|tence for a reward. And the soveraignty of love is distan|ced more from the approach of any subject to it. No blood, qualities, nor no fortune rayseth neerer then the common prostituted crowde. All are commons in an equall sla|very, and the pretention to advantage is rebellion.</P>

<P>As dying men whose spirits having run out their course are now so out of breath, they can scarce carry the soul one step farther; yet sometime as she is go|ing out of them, refreshed with some strong cordiall, the spirits rise againe, and hold her there a while: Like lamps exspiring when they shut their eyes, given but a drop of oy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, dart forth an instant flash, and live a while, not by that life that they had left, but did receive anew. This was my case. My spirits had scarce so much motion left as panting, when they received this Cordiall, this so sove|raign remedy, as it hath recovered a King, whose disease it was before the being so. I find more then a reflection

<P>This from <HI>Basilino</HI> must imply that some successe hath so possest his thoughts, as the remembrance of his sufferings cannot get so much as one, and onely my af|fliction now can make him think that he is capable of a|ny: he hath such superfluities of joyes, as I am fed out of his waste. I find my body and my soul so reconcil'd, the one offers curiosity, the other strength to satisfie it.

The education you gave was such as might make my life worthie your owning, since after having given me so much wealth, and honour, as an accession un|to that could expect no more sense of it. Then as if you did study my blessing in making you some return, you have given me the disposing of your life, and the trea|sure of your trust, such a gift as but by keeping it, I might make you a retribution, but you take it away without a dailie addition to it. I have repeated this to you, which is too much for you to remember, that you may see I am thus far towards the deserving this, as the accounting all this is a curse, if the only means of gratitude which I have left, the joying in your joyes, be but suspended from me.</P>

<P>How justly am I afflicted by my owne offence, in|constancy? The Prince's change is fallen out to punish mine
<PB N="119" REF="63">
And he is so happy that even his change doth prove a service unto <HI>Fidamira,</HI> as it revenges her on me. I will not add so much unto my guilt, as a detraction from her, in the beliefe that he could preferr any thing before my offer, but a well grounded hope of <HI>Bellesa's</HI> Love.</P>
<P>None but I could do so new a thing, as to preferr des|paire. How well doth my curse sute with my sin?

My obser|vation hath assur'd it me, without the helpe of my sus|pition. And I am punish't as it were by fate with an ex|clusion from the Prince's trust, before he can know a reason for't. O how deceitfull and ensnaring joyes, are Prince's highest trusts? They doe subject us more then even our nature or their power can. They raise us so above the sense of all their other benefits, as we are only fixt on that which they may so easily take away, as even cessation doth remove it. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o we do expose, not only all the joyes we have acquired, but even the imbred ease of our own soules. Which might have rested in their own levell, but cannot in a declination from that height. So subjects hazard more then Princes give! Yet methinks love is so much above reason now, as it proves the Princes trust a convenience, not a losse, as it may warrant my profession of my passion to <HI>Bellesa,</HI> which I will do in so resolved a boldnesse as it shall be significant humility, as it must imply the extreame of all despaire.</P>

<P>There's nothing speakes so truely of <HI>Bel|lesa</HI> as my opinion of her. I will beleeve my admiration before my senses. I am so far from crediting what I hear of her, as I do not beleeve her selfe. Her modesty will not ad|mit the knowing of her selfe so well as I do. For though my thoughts in their highest extasie pitch not at the top of all her vertues, yet they get up so high, as to assure
<PB N="120" REF="64">
how low and neere the earth her soule can fall. Though I cannot imagine all the good that she can do, yet I can satisfy my selfe how neere she can come to doing ill, to which she can never approach so neer as loving; Though that be farr from ill, yet as it is but ordinary, it may be counted too much ill for her. Shee's somwhat of her selfe; I know not what to call her, so unlike to all things sub|lunary, that we may better think the humility she beares chose rather to be a woman, then that heaven meant her one; Unlesse it set her in this way, that passing through it she might rise unto a higher glory, then if she had been first created an Angell. I do not wonder at the received opinion of her loving. I would not have the knowing of her be common as to undeceave every body; and for those that hope it, they have made themselves a curse. I cannot pitty enough, as it is a madnesse they will never beleeve it to be one. <HI>Moramente</HI> is a person worthy the knowing <HI>Bellesa, Gemella's</HI> womanish officiousnesse will be puni|shed in the frustration of it.

forgive <HI>Agenor</HI> so, as all the memory I have now left, is of my own fault, that it was ever in the power of a man so to offend me. I confesse I could wish his repentance, on|ly to expiate that fault of mine, by shewing how much I repent of it, by being now incapable of such an exposure of my self againe. I am not so vain as to believe my looks can perswade him to this repentance, therefore I have thought a way how they may fright him to it, and for that I must put on this colour's contrary, and like a ghost appear unto him. His guilt will joyne with me in the per|swasion of it. Thus I will watch him the next evening, as he goes to the Temple.

<P>You may safely trust my hope Madam; hope seemes so dull and slow a thing to me, I can scarce think it is a function of the soul. I must have it by infusi|on, not inherencie.

<P>How well hath fortune shewed, I am her own, in having thus imployed my self to betray that strength of happinesse which was impregnable, and must have been delivered thus by me, since her self could not take it? Sure fortune grew Jealous, least the world should thinke she was in love with me, and there's nothing so detracting from fortunes reputation, as the opinion that she can fa|sten her selfe to any one. She is the whole world's Mi|stresse, and her loose variations entertain all her servants in variety of hopes, and so drawes on those generall ad|dresses which busie and divert her so. Me-thinks she might have counted me her child, and so have justified
<PB N="127" REF="67">
unto herself her tendernesse of me. For when my Infant-bloud seemed destined to the thirst of multitudes; even there she took me in her armes, and set me at the breasts of Princes to be nursed; and not content with that, endea|red me so unto them, as if I had sucked their hearts into me, and they lived by me. This hath been confirmed unto me by such a disposition of their powers, as if they had no power but this of giving me so much: and because all this might be thought subject still to fortune, she provi|ded me a blessing above her power of resuming <HI>Fidami|ra's</HI> Love. And sure 'tis that which hath incensed my mother Fortune thus against me, that repulse that she re|ceived in her attempting <HI>Fidamira</HI>: for never was fortune more affronted, than in her refusal of the Prince. It must be so that she grew jealous of my being set above her reach, and finding her self so weake, hath got Love to joyn with her to take me by my selfe, that I might give away what could not be resumed. And now I am so com|pleately miserable, I cannot call my affliction misfortune. I have this circumstance to perfect it, the attribution of it wholly to my self. I have told <HI>Bellesa</HI> my passion so di|rectly, she seemes not to understand it. Sure it had so wild a boldnesse, it looked liker Madnesse then Love. It is but just, that I that have so much neglected truth, should be discredited by it. Whither but to my self should I repair for satisfaction, since I am my owne offender? Therefore from thence I derive a happinesse that shall de|fie even fortune, the adoration of the not epitheted <HI>Bel|lesa</HI>; it shall be so little subject to chance or change, it shall make despair a reason for it, to be sure to defie both those. Nay I will not exact lesse of my self then the doing what was never done before, the allowing <HI>Bellesa</HI> to love ano|ther, and even proportion my joy in this, to what she shall receive in that.

<P>Will you forgive me Sir, if I call that, which it may be you meant an honor, your resuming of your grant of privacy, an intermission of my peace. From whence I did derive such feare, as the protection of a King did most expose me to, the apprehension of such an eminence intended me, as I could only come neere the deserving, by the avoyding: And yet so possesse my selfe of a more af|fected happinesse, your estimation of my vertue; which I tendred the preservation of the more, because yours must have suffered with it.</P>
<P>For, the honors you had designed for me, were raised to such a height, as being above the capacity of the greatest

part of the lookers on were likely to be misunderstood. Therefore to avoyd the occasion of being but so much as an error in your unqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stionable worth, I chose this as the lesse danger, the flying into some concealed retreate; and not trusting so much to my legs, I made my face run away to carry me securely. And in this disguise of a Moore I fled hither, where I made bold to use your name to be received. And here I found my flight and my dis|guise so much out-done by strangers, as I had no won|der left for my own condition.

<P>Ask no other caution <HI>Fidamira</HI> but thy be|liefe that I cannot disobey thee.

To morrow is a new election of a Queen, and that light will cleare all that must yet remain obscure to you.

My fears that find nature too steep to climb directly up against it, do thus by circular and turning motions seeke to winde themselves up above it. As violent stormes repulsed by sences that they meet, seem to flye back, and part them|selves to goe about; and so at last insinuate themselves through those fences, that they could not break: thus doe my doubts of <HI>Basilino's</HI> and <HI>Fidamira's</HI> knowing one another, and loving here, worke themselves into me by winding-circumstances, which are so weak as must goe a|bout, my reason cannot get over it. Thus doth all jealousie run on in crooked serpentations, and seems to imbrace all reason that it meets, but 'tis but to incompasse it, and leave as it were so as an Iland, as it cannot get out, mine must stay here all night, exposed to those cold blasts my feares can shake it with.

<P>How surely do they thinke themselves away, that let Love close with their thoughts, intending they shall wrestle with it? for love in that instant that it is let in, falls under our wills, and like an inundation, all it finds por|table it raiseth up, and carrieth forward on it self, and love finds our wills so leight and so ascensive then, as it doth but take them up with this humility, and carries them along with it, and by this subjection of it self, raiseth them higher then they could e're have got without it. So that love, entred into our thoughts, as it useth no vio|lence

Nature's internal force would be too weak, I could forget I have a father, I am so <HI>Bellesas</HI> creature, had not time power over me, and that this light must see me a Prince, and her none. Her words by whose reflex we on|ly can see thoughts, have sometimes been cleer enough: yet they have been alwayes so unsteady, as like glasses turn|ed up and down, their reflex hath rather dizied my brain then assured my sight. Now I must resolve to begge of her to fix them, so as I may see what figure they have made for me. She is now gone towards Love's cabinet. I will follow her thither, expecting nothing from the place but privacie. She's love's influence, and onely can affect her self.

<P>As the humors are Madam, some say all they thinke, and yet thinke all they can too little. Others say no more then what just will serve a man to guesse at what they thinke.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure that is best <HI>Gemella.</HI> For so women retaine a power of rewarding modesty, and punishing presump|tion. Which is so easily don, as by saying nothing. But what say you <HI>Gemella</HI> of <HI>Genorio's</HI> passion, that is so bold as to fly to me for sanctuary? I had thought friend|ship had been the highest passion. Beleeving that <HI>Mora|ments</HI> greifes running through <HI>Genorio</HI> had left this sad tincture on him.

<P>Passion, Madam, is so shie of all things, as it scat|ters our thoughts abroad upon all aproaches can be made to it: And is so farr from admitting any body, as it is afrayd even of its own shaddowes doubt, and suspition which it never shines but it will make. But I wonder most

that <HI>Genorio</HI> in so desperate a passion, should seek a reason for your will, though it be to neglect him. Perfect hu|mility bows into it self, and finds reason there to justifie its adoration, by an incapacity of a fault in her it is devoted to.</P>

<P>Pardon this amazement Madam! All my Soul's faculties are drawn into my eyes to decide a doubt. In which if I durst so soon beleeve my eyes, they had already looked away my pretence, but they are too partial to me to beleeve so soon. Therefore give me leave Madam to bring them neerer the object they are now disputing on, that they may aske some Questions of my memory, so to de|cide this doubt. It must be she, nature could not make two such! Blessed <HI>Saphira,</HI> I conjure you by the remove of
<PB N="154" REF="81">
what only can be objected against your innocence. The affliction of your father and the hazard of a nation to an|swer to this name, and in a word to speake me happier <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen even the youngest here can live to. You know who asketh this pitty of you now. One whose misery is a re|proach to you.

<P>Stay <HI>Genorio,</HI> sure I owe him more pitty that would revive me, than one would antedate my death. Worthy <HI>Romero</HI> I will answer to that name, and in this instant make thee so happy as to indebt all the Society to thee for the knowledg of me. And to inlarge this pre|sent of my selfe unto thee, I will bring a witnesse thou wilt willingly beleeve, thy son, whose flight with me if it do need forgivenesse cannot be denied now.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Romero.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me Madam, if I refuse a thought yet so low, as the joy of finding a son. You must have all my soul a while, till I have discharged my selfe of what I owe your father. In whose name I am to beg of you, and conjure all this society, whom I esteem so justly blessed, as I doubt not of their wishes to my successe, to joyne with me in a pretence, I am to deliver to you in the name of the King, and of a Nation, which by me now begs reliefe of you. This Society understands you so well as I may better aske of them then tell them, what a bles|sing your company is. And if it be such an one to stran|gers,
<PB N="155" REF="81">
let them judge what a joy it will be to a father, to whom you have been so long a stranger. And though it seemed misfortune cannot afford you lesse then a Crown, yet you ought not to make that Crown, which nature hath made yours, unfortunate. Therefore heare the dis|tresses of the King your father, that cry so lowd in the complaints of the losse of you, as they hear not the cries of all his kingdom for their exposure to the first strong pow|er that will seize it. His age must quickly leave the first invader for his heir. You know your brother and your sister, the Prince <HI>Palant,</HI> and the Princesse <HI>Miranda,</HI> per|ished both infants at the seige of the cursed <HI>Pamlona.</HI> Since, the King your father having destin'd you to the Prince of <HI>Castile,</HI> a Prince thought a match for your ver|tue as well as your condition. In the time of this treaty you fled, attended only by my son. I upon whose trust this misfortune lay like Treason, have been ever since in the search of you, and now the gods have been pleased to blesse my dispaire with what they have so long denied my hope, the finding you, Madam. I must now addresse my selfe not only to you, but all this society for judg|ment of this pretence of a King, and a Nation, which in a new way demands reliefe, not by admittance but dismis|sion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confesse <HI>Romero</HI> all you have alledg'd against me: But, in my defence, desire this faire Society, whose judgments would be injured in my unnaturallnesse, to beleeve that even these and the honor of this place did not divert me from the sense of my fathers afflictions, whose reliefe I did deferr to bring thee more intire, after the Prince his marriage should, have removed all subject of dispute between us.</P>
<P>Here I resolve to stay till then, confident that my fathers consent to the estimation of my selfe, in the expression of my equall unwillingnesse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o that, his passion to <HI>Fidamira</HI> did avow, would justify my presumption on his pati|ence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rom.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was a sense Madam you ought your vertue, while the Prince's unsensiblenesse seem'd to provoke it to a valuation of its selfe. But now the same vertue that did convict him will plead for his acquittance. Now as your goodnesse ought not to avert it selfe from his repen|tance, which his leaving <HI>Fidamira,</HI> and his journey de|voted to your pardon, do assure: therefore Madam in my mind you owe the King your father this satisfaction for all his sufferings, A returne of a full obedience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or all the hazard he hath runn with you I have heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> late, that he hath pittied so the Prince as your admission of him into yours, would b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a joy that would ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are your presence.

other losses, having in this one blessed a whole nation. This is the Prince <HI>Palante</HI> you have saved. I that was trusted with him, and the government of <HI>Pamlona,</HI> can assure it. Now you may remember Sir, that you surprised the Town when I was absent, two Princes were then in my charge, this and a daughter of the Kings, both infants. The general execution that was committed then left us no hope of safety for these Princes. And since, the King ha|ving this Princesse <HI>Saphira</HI> hath razed out the memory of any losse, and now the finding of the Prince <HI>Palante</HI> must be a joy to the King, and her, scarce to be beleeved; They did not come from Paradise: Let me then beg of you to be a witnesse to this claime that I shall make.</P>

<P>This j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">well, I have so enquired after, is the wit|nesse of what the King hath bin pleased to acquaint you with.

The town in my absence was surprised, and the impartial execution that was commit|ted to the incensed So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ldiers, destroyed all our hope of either of your safeties. Now the King assures me that you were then brought to him with this jewel about you, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e command saved your life by the intercession of the Prince. The time which hath changed all things else about you but this jewel, leaves my memory no other certainty. Your sister had another too, which concurring with the Kings relation, makes it unquestionable. It seems even your infancy had some such divinity in it, as did infuse a soul into that body, should have taken yours a|way, and so at once inlarge your obligation, and invest your self with the power of acquittance too, to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se brave Princes.</P>

<L>Reason and Wonder are so reconcil'd</L>
<L>In you, as married they have had a child:</L>
<L>Whose first conception was the birth</L>
<L>Of more then was conceiv'd before on earth</L>
<L>So Love that did so long in labour lye</L>
<L>Deliver'd of impossibility</L>
<L>Is now at last, and so can never more</L>
<L>B'in danger of miscarrying as before.</L>
<L>For your divine example needs must prove,</L>
<L>The heighth of vertue doth consist in love.</L>
<L>So Love shining in you by this reflex</L>
<L>Raiseth both light and heat to either sex.</L>
<L>Since your example doth to all declare</L>
<L>None innocent that love not, nay not faire.</L>
<L>For they can neither handsome be, nor true,</L>
<L>That may and yet refuse to be as you.</L>
<L>If any thing impossible be now</L>
<L>In love, tis that your vertue may allow.</L>
<L>For even your loving doth become a proof</L>
<L>It is impossible to love you enough.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
