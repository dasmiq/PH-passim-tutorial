<P>3. Composed was this Psalme, at what time<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. The occa|sion. 2 Sam. 8. 3. 1 Chron. 18. 3.</NOTE> the King stroue with <HI>Aram Naharim,</HI> and with <HI>Aram Zobah</HI> in the vallye of salt; where <HI>Abishai</HI> the brother of <HI>Ioab</HI> at the first onset slew sixe thousand, and <HI>Ioab</HI> prosecuting the victorie, slew twelue thousand more, in which conflict, and slaughter of eighteene thousand; <HI>Siria</HI> was cleane vanquished, and subdued.</P>

<P>The King therefore consults God touching his purpose, and intendment against the <HI>Idumaeans,</HI> laies forth to view former calamities happened to his people, whereby he moueth God to pittie them; Afterward receiuing warrant from God, and grounding his confidence thereon, hee resol|ueth with himselfe, and encourageth his armie to doe valiantly. This is the occasion, title, and summe of this psalme.</P>

<Q>Not only the power of the King, but his Will, and skill also are both po|sitiue, and indicatiue, peremptorie, and Imperatiue.</Q>

Put the case that the <HI>Power</HI> of kings bee peremptory, yet I hope the <HI>Will</HI> of kings is not. Yes their very <HI>Will</HI> is not on|ly positiue, and Indicatiue, but also peremptory, and imperatiue. <HI>Ouer Edom will I cast out my shoe.</HI> The <HI>Power</HI> of a king is from God, and inuested in the kings owne person, for all inferiour <HI>Delegates</HI> whatsoeuer deriue their authority personally, that is, from the kings person, which person of a king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n law is <HI>mixta persona, &amp; iurisdictionis capax;</HI>

In the the kings transcendent, and extrauagant will, wee must be <HI>Patients</HI> couching downe vnder the bur|then, weeping by the waters of <HI>Babilon</HI> (not war|ring) but looking vp to God for release. In this case a Buckler, not a sword is to be vsed. For the command is not, that we should be subiect to ver|tuous, and godly Gouernours, but (as I haue said) it is indefinite to <HI>Powers,</HI> in that they be <HI>Powers.</HI> For if the <HI>Power</HI> shall be willing to cast out, or o|uer vs euen his shooe, none ought to dare once to lift vp his heele against it.
