<HEAD>THE
AFFECTIONS
OF A PIOUS SOUL
TO OUR
Saviour Christ.</HEAD>
<P>_UPon that day (never
to be forgotten, nor
ever without teares
to be remembred)
which stands markt
to all posteritie, with the black
note upon it, of his death, who is
<PB N="2" REF="9">
the life of all, it chanced a pious
soule from those remoter parts of
<HI>Gallilee,</HI> consining with the sea,
came up to <HI>Hierusalem</HI> in search
of our Saviour <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Where being arived, shee found
all in noyse and uprore; most part
with thronging haste, flocking
towards the Temple, and whi|spering
somewhat of strange and
admirable as they past along; the
rest in the streets effused, and wa|ving
up and downe with the tide
of severall passions, here one ex|ulting
with insolent joy, another
there as much depressed with
griefe: this, silently weeping;
that, lowdly jocund; so as you
would have imagined both joy
and griefe had inhabited there to|gether
<PB N="3" REF="9">
(as their extremes, they say,
do neere confine.) And if (as
Painters note) the same lines serve
to delineate both weeping and
laughter too, you had seene them
both exprest unto the life, in one
piece there; both yet set off with
a deep shadow of admiration.</P>
<P>Whereupon, she meeting with
none, of whom seasonably shee
might demand the cause of such
discrepant affection: And easily
conjecturing him she sought (the
exactest rule of order) there, no
where to bee found where such
disorder was, retired her selfe to
that part of the Citie, where
Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> like a swelling
tumour arises on its side, both af|ter
so long journey to repose her
<PB N="4" REF="10">
wearied limbs, as also in silence
and solitude of the place, to recol|lect
a while from noyse and cla|mour
of the Citie multitude.
Here she was no sooner come, but
behold a strange and horrid spe|ctacle
met her amazed eye. It was
of three crosses erected on the
Mount, whereon Death it seemes
had affixed in trophie of that daies
victorie, three persons crucified;
one of which (hee whose Crosse
stood in the middest, more emi|nent
than the rest) as one of more
regard, was circumstanced with a
lamentable and lamenting sort of
women, weake of sex, yet of
mightie griefe, few in number, but
equall to many in affliction, the
woes of a thousand being in every
one.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="10">
At sight of whom she straight
drew towards the place; (led
by compassion, animating her
on, with this noble thought:
how she being a member of the
universall body, the griefe of e|verie
one was in part her own.)
Where being arived, shee might
perceive <HI>Mary the mother of Ie|sus,
Mary her sister of Cleophas,
and Mary Magdalen</HI> to be three
of them, with whom being
long conjoyned in affection; by
holy sympathy, shee soone be|came
familiar with their griefe,
ere with their cause of grieving;
and wept to see them weep.</P>
<P>So long she co~tinued weeping,
&amp; as long ignorant, why (griefe
<PB N="6" REF="11">
having so stopt up the passages
of their voyces, they could not
arive to words, and her teares
drawne such a watry curtaine
before her eyes, shee could not
discerne who they bemoaned
so, only thus much shee might
perceive, his face (whosoe're he
was) was so defaced with bloud,
as a cleerer and lesse clouded
eye than hers, might well be ex|cused,
its not reading the con|tents
of it; untill at length, one
of that sorrowfull company gi|ving
first a heave or two, like
one oppressed under some pon|derous
waight, to raise her
words above her woes, burst
forth into this short exclamati|on,
<PB N="7" REF="11">
<HI>O Iesu, Iesu;</HI> and said no
more.</P>
<P>At this shee strait great with
suspition (as sorrow is ever
pregnant of suspect to be delive|red
of it, (like those who seeke
what willingly they would not
find, and but hunt their owne
feares with curiositie) deman|ded
of another, who it was they
lamented so. When she survey|ing
her with a wondring eye:
<Q>And are you alone (said shee)
so much stranger not only to
Hierusalem, but to the world,
to be ignorant who they have
crucified here. Can you feele
the earth-quake under you,
and not know it is for his suf|fering
<PB N="8" REF="12">
who made the earth?
Can you behold the Heavens&punc;
the Sun and Moone, lost in
Cimerian darknesse, and not
perceive hee who enlightned
them is here ecclips'd? Looke
upon yonder rock, it cleft
(senslesse as it is) that instant
as hee died, and what a heart
have you then, not to bee so
much as sensible of his death?
But I forget my selfe, and
whilst I seeke to find you out
a griefe (by invasion of speech)
have almost lost mine owne;
wherefore let me tell you in a
word, and then make good
my silence; It is <HI>Iesus</HI> of <HI>Naza|reth</HI>
they have crucified here.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">
At hearing of which, it was
no griefe, no passion of the li|ving
that ceazed her; but such
a stupiditie, as death could not
have rendred her more immova|ble
for the time, so true it is, <HI>Curae
leves loquuntur ingentes stupent:
Senec.</HI> Untill at last, as if but
then, the floud-gates of her tears
were drawen up, they gushed
forth in such abundance, as if
each drop had stroven to fall
first to the ground. In so much,
as had you beheld <HI>Niobe</HI> wee|ping
her childrens losse, you had
seene an image, &amp; but an image
only of her weeping him; and
yet in this excesse of teares and
griefe, as if she had beene all de|fective
<PB N="10" REF="13">
to exstimulate her heart,
the more to grieve, and excitate
affection to weep the more: In
a sad and mournfull accent shee
delivered this,
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>To excitate the affection.</HEAD>
<L>Am I a Christian then, or no?</L>
<L>I can behold Christ suffering so,</L>
<L>And feele no woe?</L>
<L>Though none, yet soft humanitie</L>
<L>Shou'd make one man commiserate,</L>
<L>When he beholds another die,</L>
<L>Such interest hath he in the State:</L>
<L>So verie Iufidels we see,</L>
<L>Are not from pitie free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then am I man, or am I none?</L>
<L>That can consider him as one,</L>
<L>And make no moane?</L>
<L>Yet were I none, the Sun, the Moone,</L>
<L>And such as but his creatures are,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13">
Would cause me feele his suffrings soone,</L>
<L>Vnlesse I were more senslesse far,</L>
<L>More dull than verie rocks and stones,</L>
<L>That now burst forth in groanes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Am I a creature then, or not?</L>
<L>That my Creators so hard lot</L>
<L>Should be forgot?</L>
<L>For sure I'm none; but nothing I</L>
<L>Can let (yet let not one teare fall)</L>
<L>Both God and man, and Maker dye,</L>
<L>As I were not concern'd withall:</L>
<L>Nothing 'mongst Christians, Creatures, men</L>
<L>Am I? or worser then?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh me, the whilst worthy of deepest hell,</L>
<L>If I without a teare can see dim dye,</L>
<L>More Infidell than Infidell,</L>
<L>More stone than stones; les man, the man am I.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Having done this, shee began
to weep againe; then shreek, as
<PB N="12" REF="14">
if her soule would with her
voyce have sallyed forth, ac|companying
her lamentations
now with wringing her hands,
now tearing her haire; Archi|tect
<HI>Sorrow</HI> never contriving
building, where was more va|rietie
of sad prospective; untill
at last <HI>Eccho</HI> being sooner wea|ried
with repeating her plaints
than she with uttering them, to
give it ease a while, though not
her selfe, shee set her silent
thoughts to task with the ac|count
of what her deerly Belo|ved
had done &amp; suffered for her,
summing up everie particular
most exact and carefully, as it
was delivered her in Inventory,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
by one was present there.</P>
<P>As first (and in generall) how
voluntarily hee offered himselfe
to sufferance for us: <HI>Oblatus est
quia ipse voluit: Isa.</HI> 53. Even to
the pointing out himselfe unto
them, who came to apprehend
him with an <HI>Ego sum:</HI> Whence
(said shee) wee may collect, (If
we would be reciprocall) there
is a kind of will and forward|nesse
requisite on our parts, in
suffering for him againe.</P>
<P>Next and in particular, what
sufferings they were, he offered
himselfe unto; As how not one
part alone, but all, even from
head to foot, everie sense of him,
and the whole exterior and in|terior
<PB N="14" REF="15">
man, was even surfetted
(as it were) with the bread of
dolour and affliction <HI>Saturabi|tur
opprobriis, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>His head crowned with
thornes, and those such rigid and
sharp-pointed ones, as the very
skin of it was wholly separated
from the skull, whilst those cru|ell
Pioners digged all his blood
out of that precious Mine. His
face livid and swolne with
the unmercifull souldiers heavy
Iron Gantlets bruizing and buf|feting
it; His shoulders gall'd
with supporting his heavy
Crosse, which, Oh with what
excessive paine hee did! whilst
they (all raw before with their
<PB N="15" REF="15">
scourging) were, in that dolo|rous
prease, even squeezed (as it
weare) to a flat cake of congea|led
blood and gore. Then, to
have his armes violently wrack|ed
out, whilest they nayled his
hands unto the Crosse; What a
torment that! For the nayles en|tring
the most sinuous parts of
them, and they shrinking (as
things naturally do) at sence of
paine, the fleshy, which were
nayled to't, and could not recoyl
nor give, must of necessity be vi|olently
divulsed from them. As
for his scourged body, it was all
torne and mangled with their
bloody whips: Wherefore at
one glance of the eye to passe it
<PB N="16" REF="16">
over, as too pitious a spectacle
long to be look'd upon, &amp; come
to his boared feet. How those
huge boystrous Nayles must
needs have torne &amp; riven them,
whilst his dying body hung
swayed upon them with all its
weight, is not without horrour
and cold sweat to be imagined;
'Mean while, what vying was
there betwixt his hands &amp; feet,
which should indure most pain
and torment (all at his cost, God
knowes) What tossing and re|tossing
of his dolorous life with
suffering betwixt them? Now
this taking it at rebound, now
that, till lighting in death's haz|zard,
the sport ended; A cruell
sport the while!</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
Then for his Senses, how
were they all tormented in him,
and he in all of them! His eyes
in seeing-nothing but what dis|consolated
and afflicted him; ei|ther
his Enemies rejoycing at his
suffering (which commonly as
much agravates, as pity aleviates
the paine o'th' sufferer) or else his
friends (those few poore friends
he had) so extreamly grieving at
it, as even derived from them, a
fresh grief to him again, and for|ced
him the comforted, to be|come
their their Comforter. <HI>Fi|liae
Hierusalem nolite flere super
me, &amp;c.</HI> Luk. 23. 28. His ears play|ed
upon from every side, with
whole volleyes of fearfull blas|phemies,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
as: <HI>alios salvos fecit se|ipsum
non potest salvum facere,</HI>
He could save others, and cannot
save himselfe <HI>Matth.</HI> 27. 42. Or
else with such bitter scornes and
taunts as these, <HI>Si Rex Israel est
descendat de cruce &amp;c.</HI> Let him
now descend from the Crosse
if he be the King of <HI>Israel. Ibid.</HI>
which to a man sensible of his
honour had been most grievous,
but to a God most intolerable
(unlesse perhaps he were ena|moured
of griefe as sure he was
that day, even to Espouse it on
the Crosse and take denominati|on
from thence, of <HI>vir dolorum,</HI>
the very husband of it, as <HI>Esaias</HI>
had prophecyed of him long be|fore)
<PB N="19" REF="17">
For his smelling I will not
offend the nice &amp; delicate with
commemorating the abhomi|nable
stench of those filthy and
loathsome Crachets (the very
Entrails of the Jewes malice)
hung clottering in his face, that
face <HI>in quem desiderant Angeli pro|spicere:</HI>
Which so much deligh|ted
the Angels to behold, of
which then they might well say
indeed, <HI>vidimus eum &amp; non erat ei
species ne&abque; decor,</HI> that they had
seen it, and there was neither
feature nor beauty in it. For his
taste, to have nothing admini|stred
it to sweeten the bitternesse
of death, but Gall and Vinegar;
When for other Malefactors
<PB N="20" REF="18">
most pleasant wines were al|lowed
&amp; provided at the publike
cost; O it was cruell! barbarous
cruell that! But he foresaw it ne|cessary
for us (whilst we live
here where the wheele of affli|ction,
with variety of new suffe|ring
every day fetches its turne
about us) to have for Imitation
his great Example of patiently
suffering all. For his feeling, we
have spoken of that before, if it
were not altogether unspeakea|ble
what he felt.</P>
<P>But alas all this of the exterior
compared to his Interior suf|frings,
is but as a single drop of
water to the whole Ocean or
the Center-point of Earth, unto
<PB N="21" REF="18">
the vast circumference of Hea|ven;
for the soule, as an instru|ment
strung with finer strings
than the body, is of more deli|cate
resentment, more sensible
of everie little touch; And how
rudely did they play upon it?
Hee could not speake to them,
though nothing but sugar and
honey, like the Bridegroome in
the Canticles; but in churlish
and bitter speech they repartyed
againe. If in soft and silken
phrase he question'd them, either
in pure disdaine and spight, they
not vouchsaf'd him answer: So,
<HI>Si interrogavero, non respondebitis
mihi, &amp;c.</HI> Luk. 22. Or else it was
in words, as hard as <HI>Semai's</HI> to
<PB N="22" REF="19">
<HI>David</HI> were, everie one accom|panied
with a stone, so crosse, so
contrarie were they in words
unto him: But in action, it goes
a thought beyond imagination,
how contrarie they were, put|ting
sinister interpretation still,
to disguise the right meaning, on
whatsoever he did. If he cured
their sick, it was to breake their
Sabbaoth; if he cast their De|vils
out, it was in the name of
<HI>Beelzebub.</HI> They held him for
Libertine, if hee eat or drunk
with them, if not for <HI>Samaritan;</HI>
so well hee might say of them;
<HI>Cecinimus vobis, &amp; non salt&acirc;stis;
lamentavimus, &amp; non planxistis;
&amp;c.</HI> Mat. 11. but they went fur|ther
yet.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="19">
<HI>Pericles</HI> could say of the <HI>Sami|ans</HI>
(not content with courtesies
they received from those of <HI>A|thens</HI>)
that they were, <HI>Infanti|bus
similes, qui cibum non nisi illa|chrymando
admittebant, &amp;c. Plu|tarch.</HI>
Like children, who whilst
they were benefited, cryed: But
what should one say of these?
Never men borne in the dis|grace
of better Nature, had such
antipathy with their best good,
as they: For marke how this
perverse, wicked, and viperous
generation (out-doing spight it
selfe) requited him for love with
hatred; for good, with ill; and
for honouring them, with dis|honouring
him againe.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="20">
And first of their hatreds to
him, let this be sufficient argu|ment,
that they could not so
much as endure his sight (and
when wee once withdraw our
eyes from any one, 'tis signe we
have withdrawne our affection
before) but whilst he projected
such right and full beames of
love on them, as even reflected
them to his very hart; the sons of
<HI>Iacob</HI> never, with more oblique
&amp; auerted eyes, beheld their bro|ther
<HI>Ioseph,</HI> than they did him.
Now if (as they say) the chie|fest
attraction of love bee love,
and he holds no commercewith
humanitie, who will nor give,
nor take affection: What should
<PB N="25" REF="20">
one think or say of this malig|nitie?
But for more ample de|claration
of their inhumanitie
to him, wee are to note; how
that hate and aversion from a
thing, which the more civill
creature doth expresse by simple
flight and avoydance; the more
savage and effe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ate doth by vio|lent
assault: So Naturalists ob|serve
in the wild Bull, such ha|tred
and nocivenesse to man, as
but object unto it the picture of
one, and presently with horne
&amp; hoofe it furiously sets upon it.
And mark now, if they did not
the like by him, when <HI>Pilat</HI> pro|posing
him unto them with an,
<HI>Ecce homo,</HI> Behold the man; they
<PB N="26" REF="21">
stantly bellowed out, <HI>Crucifige,
crucifige eum;</HI> Let him be cru|cified;
so as hee might well say
of them, <HI>Tauri pingues obsiderunt
me;</HI> that hee was encompassed
with Bulls on everie side. But
the proofe of love consisting in
action, <HI>Probatio (enim) amoris,
exhibitio est operis, &amp;c. Greg.</HI> Let
us from thence behold his love
to them, as their hatreds to him
againe, and so consider how
they rewarded him, for good
with ill.</P>
<P>You know wee have com|passion
for none, but those wee
have passion for; and where the
soyle is hate, there pitie never
growes. Now what compassi|on
<PB N="27" REF="21">
had he for them? <HI>Miserior su|per
turbam,</HI> &amp;c. and that not on|ly
in words, but in effect, mul|tiplying
bread for the hungrie,
and for the thirstie, (for those
who were necessitous) hee (as
we may say) turned stones into
water; for the delicious, hee
turned water into wine (sweet|ly
violencing all natures but
theirs the while) for their sick,
he restored them unto health,
their dead unto life againe. (To
say nothing of his spirituall be|nefits,
since they were of nature
so carnall, they had scarce a ca|pacitie
of them) and how did
they requite him? <HI>Audite coeli,
&amp; obstupescite!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="22">
So little compassion had they
of him, as when he came to die;
at what time others hate leaves
the condemned to pitie, these
pursue him farther than ever a|ny's
did (within the limits of hu|manitie)
not only to death, but
even after it, when, <HI>Unus militum
lancea latus ejus aperuit et continuo
exivit sanguis et aqua:</HI> One of
the Souldiers pierced his side
with a lance, and presently there
streamed forth bloud and water.
A barbarisme and inhumanitie,
no water could expiate enough,
but that which then issued from
his sacred side; no fire, but of
that charitie which made him
then shed his last drop of bloud.
<PB N="29" REF="22">
But to proceed; for his food,
they repayed him with the
bread of dolour, <HI>panem doloris,</HI>
&amp;c. and for his drink, with gall
and vinegar. Their infirmities,
as fast as he took them of them,
they laid them upon him: <HI>Infir|mitates
nostras ipse portavit,</HI> &amp;c.
And lastly, for giving them life,
they crucified him to death, oh
unheard of ingratitude! unpa|rallel'd
wickednesse, never to be
wrapt up in silence, nor never
unfolded in speech, but with
detestation! men worthy to be
banished humane societie, so
little of man they had in them!
but whither? for beasts were
lesse beasts than they, <HI>Bos enim
<PB N="30" REF="23">
cognovit possessorem suum,</HI> &amp;c.
Devils, lesse Devils; for they ac|knowledged
him yet the son of
God: <HI>Quid mihi et tibi est Iesu
fili Dei altissimi,</HI> &amp;c. As things
then worse than man, beast, or
Devill; let them still be Jewes,
sacrilegious in all, both to the
God that made them, and the
god they made; which if it
were <HI>selfe-interest</HI> (as of most
wicked mortals it is) most sacri|legious
were they even to that.
Now how for honoring them,
they repayed him with disho|nouring
him againe; and how
whilst (in a manner) his whole
endevour was to exalt them a|bove
all other people, theirs only
<PB N="31" REF="23">
was under all others to depresse
and abase him for it: <HI>Quasi op|probrium
hominum et abjectio ple|bis,</HI>
holding him (as the Prophet
said) for the most abject of peo|ple,
and opprobrious of men;
there needs no other testimony
of it, but that one act of theirs,
of preferring a <HI>Barrabas</HI> to him;
<HI>Non hunc sed Barrabam,</HI> &amp;c. A
seditious, to one who instructed
them in nothing but meeknesse
and humilitie, <HI>Discite &agrave;me quia
mitis sum et humilis corde,</HI> &amp;c. A
thiefe to one who had given
them all they had: <HI>De cujus ple|nitudine
omnes accepimus.</HI> And a
murtherer to him, from whom
they had receiv'd their very lives
<PB N="32" REF="24">
and being, <HI>In ipso enim vi|vimns,
movemur et sumus,</HI> &amp;c. O
good God!&mdash;But it is better
to say nothing here, then not to
say enough; and let Silence, the
tongue of Admiration, take up,
where ours of necessitie must
leave: This was such an affront,
such an indignitie! as (we may
imagine) sunk (heavie as lead)
so deep into the bottome of his
divine hart&punc; no humane thought
hath fathome-line enough to
sound the depth of it. Where|fore,
as a thing wholly inscru|table,
let us give it over.</P>
<P>Whilst this was discoursed
unto her, in that method and
order as we have set it downe,

you might perceive her, by often
varying colour; gesture of bo|dy,

And being armed with this
strong and vertuous resolve,
how shee longed like some
young and noble Warriour, to
experience her yet untried force
and valour, in the encounter
with some adversarie paine, per|plexitie,
or distresse, might put
her bravely to it; that whilst in
any part or sense of her, shee,
found a difficultie in the fight,
she presently might say: <Q>This
this my Saviour, for my sake
would have made nothing of,</Q>
and slight it so. Or if shee
fainted, or lost heart cry out with
that great Champion of the A|postles,
<HI>Quis nos seperabit &agrave; chari|tate

<PB N="36" REF="26">
seperate us from the charitie of
Christ? <HI>Tribulatio, an angustia?</HI>
&amp;c. Encouraging her selfe, and
resuming a strength from thence
to dare and challenge the worst
of affliction. And this from no
selfe-presumption neither (shee
well knowing how of her selfe
she could do nothing) <HI>Non quasi
ex nobis aliquid,</HI> &amp;c. But from
the confidence, or rather assu|rance,
she had in him who assi|sted
her, <HI>Omnia possum in eo qui
me confortat,</HI> &amp;c. <Q>No, no,
(would shee say) I can doe no|thing
I, but God and I can do
all: And if any imagine it a
presumption to name my selfe
with God, let them know I
<PB N="37" REF="26">
hold it a greater presumption
for any to name themselves
without him.</Q></P>
<P>How gladly for his sake
would shee have embraced a
contumely and scorne, would
have abhorr'd an eye of flesh &amp;
bloud (I meane such eyes as the
Devill opened in Paradise long
since; not such as our Saviour
opened on the Crosse to day)
how greedily would shee have
put up an injurie and affront, e|ven
as a jewell in the cabinet of
her heart, to weare on that gene|rall
day, when all our braverie
here; shall be quite out of fashi|on,
and they onely accounted
gloriously brave, who have such
<PB N="38" REF="27">
jewels as those to weare: And
never stood on such nice termes,
the whilst, as: <Q>Had I deserved
it, it would never have grieved
me; or from any, but such and
such from whom I least expe|cted
it, it had beene far more
tollerable, &amp;c.</Q> And (I pray)
from whom could our Saviour
lesse have expected the payment
of those injuries and affronts
(which past so currantly with
him) than from the Jewes,
whom he had obliged not only
with all the ties of Humanitie,
but of Divinitie too? Who ever
stood more out of the way of
contempt and scorn than he? by
birth, above all exception noble,
<PB N="39" REF="27">
<HI>ex stirpe Davidis,</HI> &amp;c. borne of
the Royall Stem: of such digni|tie
of aspect, as it was said of
him, <HI>Speciosus forma prae filiis ho|minum:</HI>
He was faire and love|ly
above the sons of men. And
to conclude, of life and manners
so irreprehensible, as hee put his
verie enemies to it, with urging
them, <HI>Quis ex vobis arguet me de

or fault in him. And let any
now that find themselves a|grieved,
they are not respected
according to their merits and de|serts,
examine where they ever
have deserved so much of respect
as he, and had so little paid; and
if they finde it so, I'll say they
<PB N="40" REF="28">
have reason and just cause to
complaine indeed. No, these
are but rags of patience the poor
and wretched soule puts on,
whilst the gallant and richer
scornes to weare such piec'd-up
stuffe; this is for those who ne|ver
endevour to limb and pour|traiture
in the table of their
hearts, any brave and noble
piece, because they never take
patterne by any but base and ig|noble
ones. <HI>Inspice &amp; fac secun|dum
exemplar quod tibi in monte
monstratum,</HI> &amp;c. Did they but
consider our Saviours sufferings,
their own would shrink to no|thing
in comparison.</P>
<P>Which whilst she considered,
<PB N="41" REF="28">
it made her so brave in purpose
and resolution, as even death it
selfe would have appeared love|ly
and amiable to her, which
now since hee died for us, to
those who truly love him, even
seemes to have exchanged darts
with love indeed: As thus they
fable it:
<Q><L>Love and death o'th' way once meeting,</L>
<L>Having past a friendly greeting,</L>
<L>Sleep, their wearie eye-lids closing,</L>
<L>Laid 'em downe, themselves reposing:</L>
<L>Love, whom divers cares molested,</L>
<L>Could not sleep; but whilst death rested,</L>
<L>All in haste away he posts him,</L>
<L>But his haste full deerly costs him.</L>
<L>For it chanc'd that going to sleeping,</L>
<L>Both had given their darts in keeping</L>
<L>Vnto Night, who, Errors mother,</L>
<L><PB REF="29">
Blindly knowing not one from t'other,</L>
<L>Gave Love deaths, and ne're perceiv'd it,</L>
<L>Whilst as blindly Love receiv'd it:</L>
<L>Since w^c^h time their darts confounding,</L>
<L>Love now kils in stead of wounding:</L>
<L>Death a joy in hearts distilling,</L>
<L>Sweetly wounds in stead of killing.</L></Q></P>
<P>And thus in various cogitati|on
she wandred about (Mount
<HI>Calvary</HI> affording a large and
ample field for her devotion to
exspaciate in) her pious thought
still going in circle from her Be|loved
unto her selfe, and from
her selfe to him againe, untill at
last it was suddenly surprized by
the unexpected arivall of some
new-commers there, who ten|ding
directly towards the crosse,
<PB N="43" REF="29">
made her feare some ill intenti|on
in it, till espying <HI>Ioseph</HI> of
<HI>Aramathea,</HI> a principall amongst
them, she assured her feares, there
was nothing but good inten|ded;
as indeed their comming
onely was, to take downe the
body from the Crosse, and bury
it. To which every one lending
a ready and pious hand, it had
soone beene done, had not this
impediment occurred in the do|ing
it, that their griefes for his
death rendred them so nigh dead
themselves, as they scarcely could
performe the offices of the li|ving;
and those who swouned
not for love of him, would
swoune for verie sorrow they
<PB N="44" REF="30">
loved him not enough, confir|ming
what they report with
admiration of the effects of di|vine
love.</P>
<LG>
<L>O heavenly darts</L>
<L>Of love, unto heaven loving harts;</L>
<L>Whether ye wound or spare,</L>
<L>How equally yee mortall are?</L>
<L>For if yee wound them, presently</L>
<L>They with the sweetnesse dye;</L>
<L>And if yee spare 'em, then</L>
<L>With bitternesse they dye agen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O sacred flame</L>
<L>To hearts, once melted in the same,</L>
<L>Whether or no yee burne,</L>
<L>How both to their destruction turne?</L>
<L>For if yee burne, they presently</L>
<L>In flames consume and dye:</L>
<L>If not, in teares they then</L>
<L>Consume, and dye agen.</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="30">
So as like two wayes that run</L>
<L>Their severall course, then joyne in one;</L>
<L>And whilst diversly they tend,</L>
<L>One and the same is still their end.</L>
<L>So both equally destroy,</L>
<L>Be it sorrow, be it joy;</L>
<L>Or in water, or in flame,</L>
<L>The end of both is still the same.</L>
</LG>
<P>Neither is it to be so much ad|mired,
they thus could dye (as
it were) for him; but the greatest
wonder is, that they could live,
now hee was dead who was
their very life; hee who had so
many attractive sweets in him,
as drew all to him; but such,
who like <HI>Scarrebs</HI> delighted to
live in stench, <HI>Curremus in odo|rem
unguentorum tuorum,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="46" REF="31">
Hee who had such divine ma|gick
in his face, as charm'd all
that beheld it, and was of so ra|vishing
entertainment besides,
hee spake all flame and fire;
<HI>Nonne cor nostrum ardens in nobis
erat dum loqueretur,</HI> &amp;c. Able to
burne and dissolve the ice of as
many hearts, as ever the cold of
death, or tepiditie had frozen
up, provided that venomous
serpent had not first fixt its black
tooth in them; for then the <HI>Pol|linctori</HI>
will tell you, that hearts
envenom'd will not burne. No
wonder then (I say) that him
who they so loved living, they
so lamented dead: It being by
Natures Lawes decreed, wee
<PB N="47" REF="31">
then should love things most
passionately and deerest, when
wee were deprived of them:
Whether because the appetitive
&amp; irrascible power, then joynt|ly
move more strongly towards
the object, than can joy alone in
the fruition of it; or that our
sharp appetite of things wee
want is soone blunted with the
enjoying them. Certaine it is,
whatsoever the cause be, such is
the effect, as they well experien|ced
everie one of them; his bles|sed
mother, whilst shee called to
mind, what a deere and amia|ble
son; his friends, what a true
and constant friend; and what
a kind and loving Master his
<PB N="48" REF="32">
Disciples had lost of him: In
remembrance of which, when
they had buried him (as with all
due rites and ceremonies of
griefe they did: his sacred mo|ther
embalming him with her
teares, the holy <HI>Magdalen</HI> with
her sweet unguents, for which
her memorie is so pretious in
the Gospell, as there never oc|curs
mention of any, but her
name enters as an Ingredient.)
They departed each one with
somewhat to foment their me|mories
of him: One, with the
thought of his sweet and gentle
conversation of life; another,
with that of the excessive love
he declared unto them in death.
<PB N="49" REF="32">
Amongst the rest, our pious
Soule, ever to have a memoriall
of his passion, digged him a new
monument in her bosome,
and buried him in
her heart.</P>
