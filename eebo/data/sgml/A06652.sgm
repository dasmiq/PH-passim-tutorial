<P>Again, Glory be to God on hie, and peace

him not ioy, but greef of minde, not peace
but trouble of bodie, not Saluation, but
plaine distructio~ bothe of bodie and soule
to so many as embrace hym.</P>
<P>3 <HI>Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. ii.</NOTE> when he should be borne, could
haue no roume in the Iune, and therefore
was borne in a Stable: and beyng wrap|ped
in poore and homely swadlyng clou|tes,

<P><HI>Antichrist,</HI> before he bee borne, hath a
gorgious &amp; richely apparelled house pre|pared

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> beeyng borne, is moste ten|derly

and in all pointes warely kepte, and cir|cumspectly
atte~ded, that no greef or mis|fortune
chaunce vnto hym, so deare is he

to the children of this worlde.</P>
<P>5 <HI>Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. ii.</NOTE> when accordyng to his age, he
ought to haue been bothe tenderly and
quietly norished, was compelled through
the crueltie of Tyrauntes, to bee caried
from countrey to countrey, and yet hard|ly
founde he reste at any tyme, so in all
pointes did the Crosse followe hym, euen
from the verie cradle, as thei vse to saie.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> is bothe delicately and ten|derly
fostered, and brought vp without al
noise and disquietnesse. All Epicures and
worldlynges delight in hym. Thei seeke
to pleasure hym. He is free at all tymes
from all Crosse.</P>
<P>6 <HI>Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. ii.</NOTE> when he was borne, had little
resorte vnto hym,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. ii.</NOTE> for to releeue his poore
and miserable state, beside the Shephear|des,
and the wise men of the Easte, with a

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> hath the whole worlde floc|kyng
to hym, which cease not to giue, and
offer vnto hym greate &amp; precions giftes,
although otherwise ouerflowyng with
the aboundance of all thynges.</P>
<P>7 <HI>Christ</HI> beyng but twelue yeres of age
was studious of Goddes worde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. ii.</NOTE> and so de|sirous
<PB REF="4">
of the knowledge thereof, that for|gettyng
his carnall freendes, and their
companie, he remained in the Temple of
Salomon at Ierusalem, sittyng in the
middes of the Doctours, hearyng them
and posyng them.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> hateth the knowledge of
Goddes worde, and so many as fauour it,
forasmuche as it is contrarie to his filthy
will, and beastly pleasure, and deliteth on|ly
in that doctrine, whiche serueth his vo|luptuous

<P>8 <HI>Christe</HI> was obediente to Marie his

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> will obeye no man, but rule
ouer all men, giuyng hereby an example
of pride, and disobedience to all men.</P>
<P>9 <HI>Christe</HI> (as some affirme) from the
tyme of twelue yeres of age, till he was
thirtie yere old, accompanied Ioseph his
Mothers housebande, whiche was a Car|penter
by his occupation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No manne ought to be idle in a chri|sten common weale.</NOTE> and laboured
diligently in that arte, by this meanes
gettyng his liuyng with the trauaile of
his ha~des, and with the sweate of his bro|wes,
<PB REF="4">
accordyng to the commaundemente
of his heauenly Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Thess. iiii.</NOTE> giuyng a good
example in this behalf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ii. Thess. iii,</NOTE> to all that professe
his name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. iii.</NOTE> that none in a Christian Com|mon
weale ought to liue idlely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 128.</NOTE> but euery
manne woorke some good thyng that he
maie haue not onely whereof to liue hym
self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marke. vi.</NOTE> but also to giue vnto the needie. And
hereof commeth it, that Christe is called
a Carpenter in the Scripture.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> is altogether otherwise af|fected.
For he vseth no exercise, that god|ly
and profitable is, but liueth altogether
idlely, of the labour of other mennes han|des,
and of the sweate of other mennes
browes, contrary to the commaundeme~t
of God, beyng in deede a verie vnprofita|ble
clod of the yearth. And as he hym self
is estraunged from all Godlie and vertu|ous
exercises:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The idlenes of the popish spiritualtie,</NOTE> So likewise doeth he en|fraunchise,
and make free from all worke
and laboure, all his spirituall smered sha|uelynges,
appointyng the~, not to preache
the woorde of God, nor to administer the
Sacramente of Christe purely and since|rely,
accordyng to Christes Institution,
but to saie Mattens, Masse, and Euen|song,
<PB REF="5">
and to sette forthe his ordinaunces
and decrees, &amp;c. that thei maie seem at the
least to doe somewhat, although that som|what
in deede be nothyng.</P>
<P>10 <HI>Christ</HI> as he prospered in age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. ii.</NOTE> so like|wise
did he in wisedome and fauour, with
God and men.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> the older he waxeth, the
worse he is, hated both of God and of all
Godly men.</P>
<P>11 <HI>Christ</HI> disdained not to bee Baptised
of Iohn Baptiste,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. iii.</NOTE> a poore man and a prie|stes

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> will haue nothing ministred
vnto hym,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antichrist ca~+not abide the Mariage of Priestes.</NOTE> but of great princes, mightie

and of greate glory in the worlde. As
for poore menne hee regardeth not, and
as touchyng the lawfull children of prie|stes,
he can by no meanes abyde them as
a matter condempned in his deuilishe de|crees
and Luciferlike lawes.</P>
<P>12 <HI>Christe</HI> although sente doune for that
purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. iii.</NOTE> tooke not on hym the office of

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> thrusteth hymselfe in the mi|nistery
without any certaine callyng, yea
and that not to doe good, whiche is con|trary
to his nature, but to doe euill, euen
to corrupt the congregation of God with
his pestilente doctrine, and corrupte ma|ners,
and vnfruitfully to eate the Milke
of the sheepe, and to bee apparelled with
their wolle, by this meanes defraudyng
both the true Ministers and also the pore
members of Christ of their liuyng: being
of the number of them, of whom God by
the Prophet speaketh on this maner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ieremi. xxiii.</NOTE> I
spake not vnto theym, and they prophe|cied
I sent them not, and they ran.</P>
<P>13 <HI>Christe,</HI> although called of God vnto
the office of preachyng, and annointed
with the Oyle of gladnesse, that is to say,
the holy ghost, aboue his fellowes, fel not
streight waies vnto preaching, but seque|styng
himselfe from the company of all
men, gaue himselfe by the space of fortie
daies and forty nightes to fastyng and
praier, that he might be the more able to
fulfill that worke, wherunto God had cal|led
<PB REF="6">
hym,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. xlv.</NOTE> vnto the glory of gods most glo|rious
name, and vnto the profit of his ho|ly
congregation.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> after he hath thruste hymself
into the ministerie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. iiii.</NOTE> rashly and without a|ny
aduisement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark. i.</NOTE> vnworthely and without
any due preparation vnto so worthy my|steries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. iiii.</NOTE>
as a filthy Sowe and vomityng
dogge, taketh in hand the diuine offices,
geuyng hymself neither to praier, nor yet
to fastyng, but rather to carnall pleasure
and beastly belly chere, nothyng caryng
for the glory of God, nor for the profit of
his people, so that he may liue wealthily
and accordyng to the lustes of the fleshe.</P>
<P>41 <HI>Christe</HI> in the tyme of his fastyng and
praier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. iiii.</NOTE> was greuously tempted of Sa|than,
and of the infernall army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. iiii.</NOTE> whom all,
hee mightely and valeauntlie ouercame
with the moste mightie and valeaunt ar|moures
of Gods worde.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> as he neuer fasteth and pra|yeth
a right: so is he neuer tempted of sa|than
for the probation and triall of hys
faith and constancie, as one that is alrea|dy
in Sathans nettes, and in his posses|sion
as a moste miserable slaue and vile
<PB REF="6">
paysaunt. And if at any tyme he will de|fende
himselfe against Sathan, and suche
like wicked spirits, he fleeth not vnto the
worde of God, but vnto holy water, holy
Bread, holy palmes, holy candels, holy
fyre, &amp;c.</P>

himselfe is so riche, and hath such

his lousy lawes and deuelishe decrees, he

tyrantlike practised in diuerse and many

vpon his pylde pate. This authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Popes triple crown, what it signi|fieth.</NOTE>, this
Antichrist receaued of the diuell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. iiii.</NOTE> for the

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> chalengeth greater power,

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> is not ashamed too bragge,
that hee is Lorde ouer the Scripture to
alowe or disalowe it. For of me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca. Si omnes.</NOTE> saith he,<NOTE PLACE="marg">O Antichri|ste.</NOTE>
it taketh his full authoritie. And for a to|ken
of this, the Scripture of Christe is
laied vnder his fete, when he is at Masse.</P>
<P>57 <HI>Christe</HI> commaunded by his Apostle
sainct Paule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Timoth. ii.</NOTE> that a bishop should be apte
to teache,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Titus. i.</NOTE> and that hee ought to bee well
learned, that he may be able by his whol|some
doctrine both to exhort and to ouer|come
all theym that resiste and be against

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> will neither teache nor di|spute
with any man in the holy scripture
for the maintainaunce of the Christen
faith, but onely for to augment his owne
kingdom, and to stablish his owne lawes.
And if any dispute with him, they shall be
cast first into prison: where he and his mi|nisters

and scourge them, and with infinite other
tormentes punishe theim, to make theim
forsake the trueth: and afterwarde make
them sweare on a booke, that they shall
tell no man of it. Thus cruelly doth An|tichrist
entreate man for the truthes sake
againste all iustice. And if he can not sub|due
them to his will, then either he mur|dereth
theim priuely in Prison, or els hee
committeth them vnto the seculer power
as vnto his Hangmen or Butchers to be
burned. And thus is the disputation en|ded,
and Antichrist hath gotten the victo|rie.

for our saluation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ii. Timoth. ii.</NOTE> as saincte Paule
saieth: All Scripture giuen by inspira|tion
of GOD, is profitable to teache, to

righteousnesse, that the manne of GOD
maie bee perfecte, and prepared vnto all

<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> saieth, that though it bee

all truthe necessarie to saluation, is not
there to bee founde, but there are other
truthes as necessarie to bee beleued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unwriten vereties.</NOTE> vn|der
paine of damnation, as those that bee

that thei bee of equall aucthoritie

giue thee vnderstandyng in all thynges.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> saieth, that the interpreta|tion

of the Fathers, and old auncient
writers, and of the aucthoritie, and con|sente
<PB REF="34">
of the Churche of Rome, whiche is
the true Churche, and mother of all chur|ches,
and can by no meanes erre, without
the approbation of the whiche, no inter|pretation
of the Scripture can bee good
and catholike.</P>
<P>3 <HI>Christe</HI> will all menne to searche the
Scriptures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ihon. v.</NOTE> and to leane vnto them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 19.</NOTE> in
all matters of controuersie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. viii.</NOTE> as faithfull

<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> commaundeth, that when
any question arise, aboute matters of Re|ligion,
menne should haue recourse vnto
the Canons, and generall Councels, but
spicially vnto the See of Roome, where
all doubtfull matters are to bee decided.
As for the Scripture, it hath no more
aucthoritie, then it pleaseth the Churche,
that is to faie, the Pope and his adheren|tes,
to giue vnto it.</P>
<P>4 <HI>Christe</HI> teacheth, that all mennes tra|ditions,
oughte to giue place vnto the
woorde of God: and that whatsoeuer is
decreed of menne, although of neuer so
greate ancthoritie and wisedome, contra|ry
to the woorde of God, is vtterly to bee
neglected, reiected, and caste awaie.</P>
<P><PB REF="34"><HI>Antichriste</HI> teacheth plainely, that all
suche constitutions, and ordinaunces of
men, as bee decreed, and set forthe by the
aucthoritie of Counselles, and holie Fa|thers)
whiche are alwaies gathered to|gether
by the instincte, and consent of the
holy ghost) although thei are not, nor can
not bee grounded on Goddes worde, are
notwithsta~dyng good and profitable: and
menne are bounde vnder paine of deadly
synne, to obtaine and keepe them. For the
Churche can not erre.</P>
<P>5 <HI>Christe</HI> teacheth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. iiii.</NOTE> that there is but one
onely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. iiii.</NOTE> true liuyng and euerlastyng God
whiche alone is to be honoured, worship
ped, and called vpon: by whose name also
alone we ought to sweare.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> also after a certaine sorte,
confessed also one God with vs, and that
he is to be honoured and called vpon, but
not alone. For he teacheth, that the sain|ctes
in heauen, bothe maie and ought to
be honoured and called vpo~, yea, and that
we maie also sweare by their names.</P>
<P>6 <HI>Christe</HI> in his holie Lawe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xx.</NOTE> bothe by
Moses, the Prophetes, and Apostles, for|biddeth
to make, sette forthe, or kepe any
<PB REF="35">
Image to bee worshipped. But aboue all
thinges, he forbiddeth vs to make any I|mage
of God.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> saieth, it is lawfull not one|ly
to haue images and to sette them vp in
Temples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Images.</NOTE> Chapels, Oratories. &amp;c. but
also to worshippe theim, to kneele before
theim, to kisse them, to praie before them,
yea, &amp; to them, to knele before them, to set
candels before them, to decke and trimme
them, to offer vnto them, to sense them, to
put of our cappes vnto them, and at the
laste,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beliques.</NOTE> what not? Antichriste also diggeth
out of the ground the olde rotten bones
or reliques of sainctes, translateth them,
encloseth them in Golde, keepeth them in
precious shrynes and costly Clausures,
and setteth them forth to the people to be
kissed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Image of the Tri|nity descri|bed.</NOTE> and worshipped. Moreouer he is
not ashamed contrarie too the manifeste
woorde of God, to make the Image of the
blessed Trinitie. He formeth and frameth
God the father like an old broken backed
man, with a white head, winckled forehed,
holow eied, slender cheeked, sharpe nosed,
tothlesse, wide mouthed, hangyng doune
lipped, crooke chinned, graye bearded,
<PB REF="35">
small necked, leane handed, and in fine, al|together
monstrous. GOD the Sonne
Antichrist setteth forth as a lusty younge
younker with his yelow lockes: and God
the holy Ghost he maketh like a yong lu|stie
White flickeryng Doue. But this
blasphemous image causeth hee to be set
in Churches and in all other places, not
onely to be considered, but also to be wor|shipped
vnto the greate dishonour of god,
the slaunder of the Christen religion, the
offence of all good men, and vnto the glo|rie
of all Gods ennemies. But what da|reth
not Antichrist doe?</P>
<P>7 <HI>Christ</HI> teacheth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. iiii.</NOTE> that the true worship|pers
muste worshippe God in spirite and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. xv.</NOTE>
trueth: againe, that they worship God in
vaine, whiche honour hym after the tradi|tions
of men.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> affirmeth, that it is lawfull
to worship God any maner of waie, so it
commeth of a good entent, good mynde,
good zeale, good deuotion, &amp;c. For God
casteth awaie the good intent of no man.
Antichrist therefore teacheth vs to wor|ship
God with Golde, Siluer, precious
stones, sumpteous vestures, candels, pal|mes,
<PB REF="36">
Ashes, bread, water, Salt, &amp;c. With
long patteryng, curious singyng, plea|saunt
pipyng, loude ringyng, &amp;c. With
Surplesses, Copes, Uestimentes, Caps,
Coules, &amp;c. with Massyng, with Pilgri|mage
goyng, with Pardons biyng, with
Beades saiyng, &amp;c. And all these thinges
he taught to be more precious and accep|table
in the sight of GOD, than to helpe
the poore, or to doe any worke of mercie.
For that is done but to manne, the other
vnto God.</P>
<P>8 <HI>Christ</HI> in his sweete Sermon that hee
made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. v.</NOTE> in the mount saieth, that he came to
fulfill the Lawe, that is to saie, to accom|plishe,
whatsoeuer was prefigured of him
in the ceremonies of the olde Testament,
so that by his comming he hath put away
and vtterlie abolished all Ceremonies,
euen as the shadow is remoued by the en|trance
of the light. For as the Apostle
saieth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. x.</NOTE> The lawe he meaneth the ceremo|niall
law was nothyng els than a shadow
of good thinges to come. The good thin|ges
are come and geuen, therfore the sha|dow
ceaseth: wherby we euidently learne
that the Christians are nowe free from
<PB REF="36">
suche cloudy lawes &amp; darke ceremonies.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> teacheth, that although the
Ceremonies<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies</NOTE> of the olde law be abolished
by the commyng of Christ, yet that hin|dreth
nothing but that the Church, which
is the spouse of Christ, may appoint what
Ceremonies she wil, without any offence
of her husband Christ, whiche delighteth
in her and in her doynges, as in himselfe,
yea and that so muche the more bicause a|mong
the christians there are many rude
grosse, and thei must be rudely and grosse|ly
handled, and brought by little and little
vnto perfection thorowe suche Ceremo|nies,
and outward obseruaunces: whiche
Ceremonies and Ordinaunces of Chri|stes
spouse the Churche, are with no lesse
reuerences to bee obserued, than if they
had beene commaunded of Christe her
husbande.</P>
<P>9 <HI>Christ</HI> Iesus in his doctrine teacheth,
that he alone is our Sauiour, our Redee|mer,
our Bishop, or Pastour, our head, our
reconciliatour, our peacemaker, and in
fine, all our hope and comfort, in so muche
that whosoeuer beleueth in hym, shall not
perishe, but haue euerlastyng life.</P>
<P><PB REF="37"><HI>Antichriste</HI> in his doctrine teacheth,
that saluation and remission of synnes, is
to bee obtained also at his handes, at his
Pardons, Indulgences, yeres of <HI>Iubile,</HI>
Masses, Coules, Pilgrimages, &amp;c. A|gaine,
that he is heade of the vniuer|sall
Churche of Christendome, Christes
Uicare, Peters Successour, the higheste
Bishop, the greatest Priest, the moste ho|lie,
and moste blessed Father, to whom a|boue
all other, the keyes of the kyngdom
of heaue~ are committed, fo that whatsoe|uer
he bindeth in yearth, is also bounde
in heauen: and whatsoeuer he looseth in
yearth, is in like maner loosed in heauen,
so that whosoeuer cleaueth vnto hym, can
not perishe, but haue life euerlastyng.</P>
<P>10 <HI>Christe</HI> taught vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. xiiii.</NOTE> that whensoeuer
wee will desire any thyng of God the Fa|ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. xvi.</NOTE>
wee should aske it in his name.<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Timoth. ii.</NOTE> For
no manne commeth to the Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Ihon. ii.</NOTE> but by
hym.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. viii.</NOTE> And in the writynges of the Apo|stles
wee reade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roma. v.</NOTE> that Christe alone is our
Mediatour, Aduocate, and Intercessour,
by whom alone wee haue free, and graci|ous
accesse vnto God the Father, and ea|sely
obtaine of hym all good thynges.</P>
<P><PB REF="37"><HI>Antichriste</HI> setteth forthe vnto vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inuocation of Sainctes.</NOTE> o|ther
Mediatours, Aduocates, and Inter|cessours,
euen the soules and spirites of
them that are departed: and commaun|deth
vs to call vpon them, to make inter|cession
vnto theim, that thei for vs maye
call vpon God, praie vnto hym, and make
Intercession vnto hym, that by this mea|nes,
our praiers maie be the soner heard,
and our petitions the more easely graun|ted.
Thus Antichrist goth about to make
Christ, Iacke out of office.</P>
<P>11 <HI>Christe</HI> hangyng on the Crosse, and
ready to giue vp his Spirite, into the ha~|des
of his heauenly Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ihon. xix.</NOTE> saied: It is fi|nished:
signifiyng hereby, that by the one

death, al thyng is wrought, and perfectly

remaineth no more any Sacrifice, or ob|lation
for synne, as the Apostle saieth:
With one onely Oblation hath Christe
made perfect for euer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> them that are san|ctified.
Againe: We are sanctified by the
offeryng vp of Christes bodie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. x.</NOTE> doen once

<P><PB REF="38"><HI>Antichriste</HI> hath sette vp diuerse Sa|crifices

whiche he calleth a propiciatorie, expia|torie,

<HI>Ad salutem.</HI> This Sacrifice he brag|geth
to bee of like dignitie, and of equall
price with that Sacrifice, whiche Christ
the high and euerlastyng Bishop, offered
on the Altar of the Crosse, yea, to bee the
verie same: againe, that he and his Chap|lens
in that Sacrifice of the Idolatrous
Masse, doe daiely offer vp the Soonne of
God to the Father of heauen, for the dai|ly
synnes of the people. Antichrist more|ouer
is not ashamed to saie, that Christe
by the Sacrifice of his death, doen on the

originall synne: but he and his shauelyn|ges,
by the Sacrifice of their Masse, put|teth

worketh by loue, signifiyng here by, that

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> saith, that faith is wrought
by Charitie, and also that charitie is the
Parent or Mother of faith, so that in the

them, if they come not at the time appoin|ted:
and if they come, they go away sorier
and sicker both in Soule and Purse, then
they came.</P>

that hee shall truely and faithfully
aunswere to all suche thynges as shall be

<P>38 <HI>Christ</HI> commaunded his Disciples to
knowe his Lawe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. v.</NOTE> and badde the Iewes

the Israelites to teache the Lawe
of God to their young children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. vi.</NOTE> and that
they should haue it bounde as a signe in
their handes, that it might be euer before
their eyes: he caused them also to write it
on the postes and doores of their houses.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> saith, it is not meete for the
lewde people to knowe the Misteries of
Gods woorde, but to beleue as Mother
holy churche teacheth them without any
further inquisition: yea he maketh it He|resie
and Treason againste Kynges and

<PB REF="45">
He hath digged Cesternes of his owne
traditions, and hath stopped vp the pure
fountaynes of Christes doctrine. He can
not abyde, that the Laity should reade the
Scripture, least they should perceaue his

Scriptures should bee painted either in
publique Temples, or in priuate houses.
The blinder the people be, the warmer is
his Kitchin.</P>
<P>39 <HI>Christe</HI> taught his disciples on this

goe and tell hym his faulte, betwene hym

If he heare not them, tell it vnto the con|gregation.
If he heare not the congrega|tion,

then after long and many moste greuous
tormentes, secretely ministered to those

at the laste he bryngeth foorthe, accuseth,
iudgeth, condemneth, and in fine, deliue|reth
to the temporall officers, as to their
Butchers and hangmen, to bee burnte at

reconciliation, that our Sauiour Christ
gaue in commaundemente, vnto as many
as take vpon them to bee his Ministers,
he vtterly refuseth, and will none of it.</P>

wherof fiue were wise, and fiue foo|lishe,

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> teacheth the contrary, and
saieth: Some men in this worlde growe
vp vnto suche perfection in doyng good

and enough for their owne saluation, but
they haue also sufficient for other: where
as we be taught in the worde of God, that
no man liuyng can iustifie himselfe in the

vnto the diminishyng of their paine, if
they be in hell, or vnto the aduauncement
of their glory if they be in heauen, or vn|to

at an other, some betymes, some late, and
yet notwithstandyng, all receiued like re|ward

that all the Sainctes of God haue one,

that one hath not a greater rewarde then
an other, but the same ioye, the same glo|rie,
and the same honour is giuen, with|out
any difference to all the soonnes of

there is no respect of persons with God.

<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> teacheth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. xiiii.</NOTE> that as there be
many mansions in the kyngdome of Hea|uen,
so are there many diuersities, and
differences of glories and ioyes in the
same, for the inhabitauntes thereof. As
there is one maner glorie of the Sunne,
and an other glorie of the Moone, and an
other glorie of the Starres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Cor. xv.</NOTE> (for one
<PB REF="55">
starre differeth one fro~ an other in glory)
so is the state of the Sainctes in Heauen.
One hath an higher place then an other,
one more glorie then an other, euery man
according to his degree, euery manne ac|cordyng
to his woorkes, merites, and de|sertes.
Hereof it should then followe, that
there is respecte of persones with God,
and that the heaue~ly glory is ours, not of
mercie, but of merite, not through Christ,
but through our owne workes.</P>
<P>66 <HI>Christe</HI> saieth: Whosoeuer putteth a|waie
his wife (excepte it bee for fornica|tion)
and marieth an other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. xix.</NOTE> breaketh wed|locke:
giuyng here libertie to the gilt|lesse

this meanes cuttyng of her self, from the
bodie of her housebande, and makyng her
self one fleshe with an whoremonger, not
onely to bee diuorced from that harlotte,
sometyme his wife, but also to marrie a|gaine,
and take an other woman to his
wife, in the feare of God. It is a common
saiyng,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. ii.</NOTE> saieth Ieremie: If a manne put a|waie
<PB REF="55">
his wife, and she goyng awaie from
him, marrieth an other manne, shall he re|sort
any more vnto her after that? Shall
not that woman be defiled and vncleane?</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> in his lawe saieth: If a
manne haue an whore to his wife, it shall
bee lawfull for hym to bee deuorced from
her, bothe from bedde and borde, but he
maie by no meanes marrie again, liue as
he maie.</P>
<P>67 <HI>Christe</HI> also by his holie Apostle gi|ueth
libertie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Cor. vii.</NOTE> to the faithfull man or wo|man,
beyng coupled in marriage to suche
an Idolatour or Infidell, as will by no
meanes forsake his Idolatrie or Infide|litie,
but rather goeth about not onely to
defende it, but also to bryng his faithfull
yokefellowe vnto it, so that the faithfull
can not liue with the vnfaithfull with a
good conscience, and accordyng to the
woorde of God, to marrie againe. These
bee the woordes: If the vnbeleuyng de|parte,
lette hym departe. A Brother or a
Sister is not in subiection to suche. But
God hath called vs in peace.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> will by no meanes suffer
any diuorcement so to bee made, that ma|riage
<PB REF="56">
shall followe, although the giltlesse
persone burne neuer so greately, and bee

if ye will, other wife get ye none.</P>
<P>68 <HI>Christe</HI> saieth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. xix.</NOTE> Honour thy Father
and thy Mother: In the whiche co~maun|demente
is required of children, that thei
giue not theim selues to Mariage, with|out
the consent of their godlie parentes.
Therefore read wee that emong the peo|ple
of God, none were coupled in Matri|monie,
but with the consent of the paren|tes.
What the Ciuill Lawe determineth
also in this matter, the learned knowe.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> in the bestowyng of chil|dren
in Mariage, requireth not the con|sente,
and good will of the Parentes: but
if thei theim selues Marrie, without the
knowledge, or consent of their Parentes
or Tutours, he alloweth it to bee well
doen, and the Mariage to bee lawfull. By
this meanes is a greate parte of that ho|noure
taken awaie from Fathers and
Mothers, that is due vnto them by their
children.</P>
<P>69 <HI>Christe</HI> beyng presente at a mariage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ihon. ii.</NOTE>
<PB REF="56">
with his Mother, and with his disciples,
teacheth euidentely, that Matrimonie
ought to bee solemnely, and openly pro|clamed
and celebrated, and that it ought
not to bee doen in corners.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> for money graunteth dis|pe~sations
to all men, for to Marie where
thei will, when thei will, and with whom
thei will. All thynges are decent and law
full, if money come. All thynges obeye
money.</P>
<P>70 <HI>Christe</HI> in his doctrine did neuer for|bidde
mariage to be contracted betwene
any persones, excepte those degrees one|ly,
whiche his Heauenly Father had to|fore
forbidden by his seruaunt Moses.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> in his Lawe prohibiteth
many and diuerse degrees to Marrie to|gether,
whom God hath sette at libertie.
He hath decreed also that Christen Gos|sippes,
that is to saie, those men and wo|me~
that haue been Godfathers, and God|mothers
together of one childe at Bap|tisme,
maie not Marrie together, nor yet
their children. If thei doe, he praclaimeth
their Marriage to bee incestuous, and
that diuorcemente muste bee made out of
<PB REF="57">
hande. This is to bee vnderstanded, ex|cepte
thei purchase a licence of hym for
money, for money maketh all thynges
lawfull in the Courte: Neither are his
Lawes any other thyng, then Nettes for
money.</P>
<P>71 <HI>Christe</HI> freely permitteth Marriage
to all degrees, none excepted, if thei haue
not the gift of continencie: neither doeth
he appoincte any tyme, when it shall not
be lawfull to solemnise Matrimonie, but
giueth libertie to all menne, at all tymes
freely to Marrie.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> as wee haue tofore heard,
denieth Marriage to all his clatteryng
Clergie, rather sufferyng them to burne,
and to runne a Whoryng, then he will
suffer them to haue wiues of their owne,
that this Prophecie of sainct Paule may<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Timoth. iiii.</NOTE>
bee fulfilled. The Spirite speaketh eui|dently,
saieth he, that in the latter tymes,
some shall departe from the Faithe, and
shall giue heede vnto the Spirities of er|rour,
and Deuilishe doctrines of them,
whiche speake falsly through Hipocrisie,
and haue their consciences marked with
an hotte yron, forbiddyng to Marrie, &amp;c.
<PB REF="57">
And as he forbiddeth certaine degrees of
menne to Marrie, so doeth he forbidde at
certaine tymes of the yere, to celebrate
Matrimonie, in somuche that whosoeuer
presumeth in those forbidden tymes to
Marrie, is not onely accursed, but his
Marriage also is not lawfull. Notwith|standyng,
if any man will bryng money,
and purchase a licence to Marrie. he shall
easely obtaine it, though it were on good
Fridaie, so deare and tenderly beloued is
that greate God Mammon, in Antichri|stes
courtes. But if it bee lawfull at these
tymes to Marrie for money: Is it not
lawfull to marrie without money? Doth
money make a thyng either lawfull, or
vnlawfull? God destroye thy kyngdome,
O Antichriste. Thy money perishe with
thee. For thy harte is not right in the
sight of God.</P>
<P>72 <HI>Christe</HI> in his holie Gospell com|maundeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Actes. viii.</NOTE>
vs to praie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. vi.</NOTE> but he prescribeth
no certaine tyme of Praier.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> appoincteth certaine ty|mes

<P><PB REF="58">73 <HI>Christe</HI> by his blessed Apostle sainct

and now is, when the true worship|pers,

Father requireth to worshippe him. God
is a Spirite: and thei that worship hym,
must worshippe hym in spirite and in the
truthe.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> teacheth, that though wee
maie praie to GOD in all places, yet
ought wee moste chiefly to praie in suche
places, as his Bishoppes and Prelates
haue consecrated, and hallowed for mo|ney,
as Oratories worthie for their ver|tue
and holinesse, wherein our Praiers
maie the soner bee hearde, and the better
accepted. And yet in these places ap|pointed
of hym for Praier, one is coun|ted
more holie then an other, and more
meritorious to praie in, as the Churche
is holier then the Chappell, &amp; the Chan|cell
holier then theim bothe: and yet the
<PB REF="58">
Chauncell holier then them both: and yet
the Cathedrall Church, otherwise called
the mother Church more holy than them
all three. But to praie at the Shrynes of
his canoniced Sainctes, or in places of
Pilgrimage, where the Deuill worketh

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> appointeth diuers and ma|ny
formes of praiyng, not to God, but to

thus are men taught to worship the crea|ture
in steede of the creator, robbing God
of his glory, and committyng moste wic|ked

<P>75 <HI>Christ</HI> saieth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. vi.</NOTE> when thou praiest, thou

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> saieth: I will that my Cha|plaines

and saie in none other places, then in the

and Chappelles and suche other Orato|ries,
yea and specially, when the people
are moste of all gathered together, al|though
they vnderstande not one worde,
what is either song or said, or on the Or|gans
plaid. And bicause they may be seen
of men, and haue the greater assembly of
people at their praiers, he commaundeth
that now one Bell shal be rong, now two,
now three, now all the belles in the steple,
by the which diuersitie of ringing menne
maye the better knowe not onely when
Antichristes Chaplaines and their com|plices
may be sene to praie, but also when
it is <HI>Festum simplex,</HI> or <HI>Festum duplex,</HI> or
<HI>Festum principale,</HI> that is to saie, single
feast, or double feast, or principall feast.</P>
<P><PB REF="59">76 <HI>Christ</HI> saith: when ye praie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. vi.</NOTE> bable not

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> doth so lade and burden hys<NOTE PLACE="marg">The long praiers of the Papists.</NOTE>
captiues with innumerable multitudes
of praiers, that they haue almost no tyme

and Mattens of oure Ladie with Prime

They haue long Letanies, long Seuen
Psalmes, long fiftene Psalmes with ma|ny

They haue Euensong of the daie,

<P>78 <HI>Christ</HI> by his Apostles commaundeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Timo. i.</NOTE>
that euery congregation should haue his
pastour or preacher, to feede the Christen
flock with the most holsome fode of Gods
worde, so that euery spirituall Minister
should attende vppon his owne cure, and
not bee distracte with the care of diuers
congregations.</P>
<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> can not away with this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pluralities of Benefices</NOTE> that
one man should haue but one benefice, and
one liuyng, therefore he dispenseth with
his Chaplains for money, to haue as ma|ny
Benefices as they can get, neuer ta|kyng
thought for the discharge of the cu|res.
He graunteth them dualities, triali|ties,
pluralities, and tot quots, to snatche
as many as they can catch. Though God
would haue one Pastour to haue but one
flocke, and one Beneficed man to enioye
but one benefice: yet Antichrist contrarie
to this moste righteous will of GOD,
graunteth to one man for money through
<PB REF="61">
dispensation to haue multitudes of Be|nefices
both against all right and consci|ence,
and againste the auncient practise
and vsage of Christes church. It is more
tollerable and praise worthy, that two or
three pastoures should haue the ouersight
of one Congregation beeyng large and
great in multitude of people (as we read,
that in the City of <HI>Philippos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. i.</NOTE> there were
diuers bishops and diuers Deacons that
did attend vpon the flocke of Christ) than
one man to haue the charge of many Pa|rishes.
How can one manne bee in diuers
places? can one man doe that whiche is
denied to Angels? I meane to be in ma|ny
and diuers places at once. Will they
commit the charge of them to other? and
hire other to satisfie their office? But our
Sauiour Christ saith:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. x.</NOTE> A good shepheard
giueth his life for his Sheepe. An hyred
seruant, and he that is not the shepheard,
neither are the sheepe his owne, seeth the
Wolfe commyng and leaueth the sheepe,
and flieth, and the Wolfe catcheth and
scattereth the Sheepe. If Antichristes
Chaplaines be not able to serue so manie
Cures (as they are not able in deede) as
<PB REF="61">
they place other in their stead, so let them
resigne and giue ouer, to their Curates
and Ministers those benefices, where thei
serue, and they themselues serue not, that
they may be the more able to doe their du|tie.
And would God suche order might be
taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> that one Benefice might bee made
of suche valour, that it might aboundant|ly
suffice on man and suche as necessarily
appertaine vnto hym, that these plurali|ties
of Benefices may once bee taken a|waie,
which without doubt hath bene the
occasion and yet is, of the destruction of
many mens soules.</P>
<P>79 <HI>Christe</HI> by his blessed Apostle com|maundeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Timoth. iii.</NOTE>
that suche should bee chosen to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Titus. i.</NOTE>

<P><HI>Antichrist</HI> repelleth and putteth backe
none from taking cure of soules, if he can
reade his Portasse and his Missall, and be
weli seene in the Pye. As for preachyng
and teachyng, except it be foure tymes in
the yere to reade to the people a generall
curse, or to tell them some narrations out
<PB REF="62">
of the Festiuale, or Sainctes lyes, lyues
I should saie, out of <HI>Legenda Aurea,</HI> he ca|reth
not for it, yea, he abhorreth it. More|ouer
Antichrist is growen vp vnto suche
fauour and madnesse, that he is not asha|med
for Money to dispense with Boyes,
and to licence them to haue cure of Sou|les,
and to enioye spirituall promotions,
whiche ought to bee the liuynges of the
true and faithfull Pastours, and of suche
as labour and trauaile in the Lordes har|uest,
where as the boyes are not able too
haue cure of their owne Soules, beeyng
more meete to be taught, then to teache.
O thou Antichriste whiche burnest with
an vnquenchable thirst of worldly goods,
what an whorishe forehead haste thou put
on, that thou darest commit the cure of
Soules, and the liuinges appointed for
the same, to children, to boyes, to suche as
be like Moyles and Horses, that haue no
vnderstandyng? Is it sitting, meete and
conuenient, that those soules, which were
so derely bought with the precious bloud
of Gods owne Sonne, should be commit|ted
to the cure, charge, and ouersight of
boyes and children? Is not this to offer
<PB REF="62">
the flocke of Christ, a spoyle to the wolfe?
Is not this to throwe mens soules head|long
doune into the deepe dungeon of hel
fyre for lacke of knowledge? Is not this
vtterly to deface the ministery, and cruel|ly
to spoyle the worthy pastours of their
liuinges, and the Christen people of doc|trine
and true administration of the Sa|cramentes?
wo worth thee, O Antichrist
with thy God that wicked Mammon.</P>
<P>80 <HI>Christe</HI> by his holy Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Peter. v.</NOTE> chargeth
all Postours to feede their flocke diligen|tly,
and to bee residente vpon their Bene|fices,
and not like an hirelyng or theef, to
forsake the flocke, and to haue no care
thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Antichriste</HI> contrarie to this charge,
and commaundemente of Christe, graun|teth
for money: non Residences to so ma|ny
as come, not caryng for the flocke, so
he maie haue the money, nor yet regar|dyng
the will of God, so that his pouche
maie bee filled with golde and siluer. Let
the Shepe of Christ runne a straie where
thei will, hange on euery Brier, fall into
euery ditche, bee deuoured of euery wolfe
yea, sincke doune into Helle: he forceth
<PB REF="63">
not. For money he licenceth the Shepe|heard
to goe whether he will, to be where
he list, and to doe, what hym moste deligh|teth.
The Pastour hauyng a good opinio~
of his Dispensation, and non residence, is
ledde with no care toward his flocke, but
doeth what he will, and yet gorgiouslie
and deliciouslie, although absent, liueth of
the Wolle and Milke of the flocke, like a
Theefe, whiche as our Sauiour Christe
saieth, Commeth not but for to steale, to
kille, and to destroye. Againste these non
Residenciaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ihon. xi.</NOTE> GOD crieth out by the

that forsaketh his flocke. By an o|ther
Prophete GOD crieth out also a|gainste<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. xiii.</NOTE>
those Shepeheardes, that feede

Woe bee vnto those Shepeheardes that

feede the flocke? Ye haue eaten

them, and thei goe a straie.</P>
<P>81 <HI>Christe</HI> saieth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marke. x.</NOTE> the workeman is wor|thie

<PB REF="64">
the more able to maintaine hospitalitie,
to releue the poore, to comfort the waie|faryng

Christians, and he giueth it to mo~|struous
Monkes, to flatteryng Friers, to

and to suche like vnprofitable mem|bers
of the christen common weale, wher|by
it is come to passe, that the true Shep|heardes,
whiche watch ouer those flockes
of the Lorde, are moste miserablie hande|led,
vniustlye and against all right &amp; cons|cience
depriued of their duetie, and thro|wen
(alas for pitie) into extreme pouer|tie:
hospitalitie decaieth, the poore are
not succoured, the needie are not reliued,
yea nothyng is done in those Parishes by
the Pastours, whereby the comfortlesse
may be comforted. No maruell when the
Papistes themselues, haue not wherwith
to relieue their owne necessitie, but are
compelled daily, as we may see before our
eyes (such is their miserie) to leaue their
flockes, whiche as Sheepe destitute of
shepheardes, wander here and there, and
too seeke other places, where they maie
haue whereof to liue, whereas if they had
<PB REF="64">
that whiche is due vnto theim, but other|wise
vniustly taken awaie from theim by
Antichristes decree, they should not onely
be able to liue themselues, but also abun|dantly
to relieue the poore. O Antichrist,
what deuill breathed this wicked affec|tion
into thy hearte, that thou shouldest
take awaie from the painefull Pastours
their right, and geue it to idle and slug|gishe
Monstrous, whose God their bellie
is.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phillip. iii.</NOTE> The Idolatrous Princes in tymes
paste gaue greate aboundance of worldly
possession to their idolatrous priests. And
arte thou nothyng ashamed to take that
awaie from the priestes of Christ, whiche
both the law of God, and the lawe of man
hath geuen theim. To robbe and spoile a
priuate man of his goods, hath alwaies
bene counted an hainous fault and synne
worthy of death: and shall it be lawfull for
thee (O thou Antichriste) to take awaie
from the Ministers of Christ their duety
and their right, and to geue it where it
pleaseth thee, O thou Godrobber. Is not
this to commit sacrilege, and also to deny
the workeman his meate, the laborer his
rewarde, the Shepheard his Milke, the
<PB REF="65">
vinekeper his wine, the warriour his wa|ges,
and to moosell the oxes mouthe, that
treadeth out the Corne. And that wicked
Spirite occupieth their myndes also in
these our daies, whiche againste all right,
and againste their owne conscience, vnto
their greate damnation, except thei short|ly
repent and amende, go forthe to kepe,
hold, and possesse these liuyngs and good|des
of the poore Pastours? Antichriste as
thei them selues confesse, neither can thei
denie it, by his Deuilishe Decree moste
vniustly, and moste tyrauntlike, tooke a|waie,
the beste portion of the Tithes fro~
the true owners, and gaue them to a sort
of monstruous Hypocrites: why then are
thei now retained of theim, that seeme to
bee enemies to Antichriste, to condemne
his Antichristian actes, and to wishe that
all abuses might be taken awaie, and that
a perfecte reformation might bee made,
accordyng to the woorde of GOD? Can
there bee any greater abuse, then accor|dyng
to Antichristes Lawe, wrongfullie
and vniustly to withholde from the true
Pastoure, and Preacher of the Lordes
woorde, that whiche is properly his due?
<PB REF="65">
The wise man saith:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. xxxiiii.</NOTE> the bread of the nedy
is the life of the poore: he that defraudeth
him of it, is a murtherer and a manslaier.
What then is to be thought of the~, which
take awaie fro~ the Ministers of the Lor|des
worde, the Tithe corne, whereof thei
should haue bread to eate, and to giue vn|to
the nedie? Is not this to plaie the part
of a murtherer? The nedie Pastour &amp; his
familie, would gladly eate bread, and the
corne, whereof it should be made, is taken
awaie fro~ the~, and vnfruitfully consumed
and deuoured of those, whiche do no good
at al to the parishes. Is not this to pluck
the meate out of y^e mouthes of the pastor,
and his familie? Whiche thyng what o|ther
is it, then to plaie the murtherer? I
deserue damnatio~, if I fede not the nedy:
shal it the~ be lawfull for me to take awaie
the right of y^e nedy? If I giue not of mine
owne to the hungrie, I synne: &amp; shall I be
counted to doe wel, when I wil not suffer
other me~ to enioy their own, but through
the prete~ce of an Antichristia~ decree, vio|lently
withhold it fro~ the~? Uerely it were
better for suche, as thus vniustly by y^e ver|tue
of Antichristes lawe, to possesse y^e law|full
<PB REF="66">
duetie, of the lawfull Pastours, to re~|der
those dueties to the owners, though
their delicate fare should somewhat be a|bated
thereby, then to goe foorthe thus
wickedly to retain, that is not their own.
What doeth it profite a man, saieth our
Sauioure Christe, to winne the whole
worlde, and to lose his soule. it is truelie
saied of the Wiseman: Better is a little
with the feare of the Lorde, then greate
treasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. xvi.</NOTE> with sorrowe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prouer. xv. xvi. and xvii.</NOTE> Again: Better is
a drie morsell with quietnesse (of consci|ence:)<NOTE PLACE="marg">i. Timoth. iii.</NOTE>
then an house full of fatte offeren|ges
with strife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Titus. i.</NOTE> that is to saie, with greef
of mynde. Once againe he saieth: Better
it is to haue a little thyng with righte|ousnesse,
then greater treasures with so|rowe.
Moreouer, the blessed Apostle S.
Paule in the description of a bishoppe, or
spirituall Pastour, sheweth, that he ought
to bee a maintainer of hospitalitie. Now
what hospitalitie can there bee maintai|ned,
where those thynges are take~ awaie,
that cheefly vphold, and maintaine hospi|talitie,
yea, without whiche no hospitali|tie
can be had? Take awaie corne, where|of
breade and drinke is made, whiche is
<PB REF="66">
the beste portion, that delongeth vnto the
maintenaunce of hospitalitie, and what
remaineth behinde, wherewith the Pa|stour
maie be able to keepe open his doo|res,
and to releeue either hym self, or any
other? Take awaie his Corne, as it is at
this day come to passe, through Antichri|stes
decree, and the vpholders of thesame:
maie not then the Spirituall minister be
called <HI>Pastor a pascendo, sicut mons a mo|uendo?</HI>
God haue mercie on vs, and sende
vs once a redresse of this greate abuse,
yea, of this thefte, sacrilege, and tirannie.</P>
<P>Furthermore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malach. iii.</NOTE> God by his Prophete
commaundeth, that all maner of Tithes
should bee brought into his Barne, that
there maie be meate in his house? Is not
the Pastours Barne, his Barne? And is
not the Pastours house, his house? Now
God commaundeth that all tithes should
be brought into the Pastours barne, that
there may be meate in the Pastors house.
But how can there bee meate in the Pa|stors
house, whiche God calleth his owne
house, because his poore-me~bers are, and
ought to bee, refreshed in the same, when
as the cheef and principall tithes, can not
<PB REF="67">
be suffered through Antichristes decree,
to be brought into the Pastours Barne,
whiche GOD calleth his owne Barne?
God cammaundeth one thyng, and Anti|christe

whose GOD the beallie is, goe
forthe to maintaine the same, and vniust|ly
to possesse the gooddes of the true, and
