<HEAD>A POEM Congratulatory ON THE BIRTH OF THE Young PRINCE.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>AS in a sullen Clowdy backward Spring,</L>
<L>The Husbandman as Clowdy does appear;</L>
<L>Mourning to see his Plants no Blossoms bring,</L>
<L>To Crown the Beauty of the ripening Year.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="2" REF="3">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>The Sun o' th' suddain dissipates his fears,</L>
<L>From whose kind heat each Plant a Soul obtains;</L>
<L>His griefs are turn'd to Joy, to Smiles his Tears,</L>
<L>Seeing (though late) the Off-spring of his Pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>So when your People, Sir, that wish'd your Fame,</L>
<L>And knew that Kings, though Sacred, Mortal are;</L>
<L>Doubted an Heir to your Immortal Name,</L>
<L>And Night might come without an Evening Star.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>When Ominous Mistrust fill'd every Breast,</L>
<L>And Sadness there did like a Chaos show;</L>
<L>Th' Eternal dash'd the Darkness from the East,</L>
<L>And said, Let there be Light, and it was so.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>Then kindled Atoms form'd a Beam so bright,</L>
<L>The dazling Joy three Kingdoms did adorn;</L>
<L>All Nature seem'd to revel in delight,</L>
<L>That happy Minute when the <HI>Prince</HI> was Born.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Each friendly Star shot his propitious Ray,</L>
<L>And blest the Morning of his Royal Birth,</L>
<L>Foretelling the Meridian of his Day</L>
<L>Would spread his Glory through the spacious Earth.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Amazing Pleasure the Beholders seis'd,</L>
<L>When Goddess Nature first expos'd a Boy;</L>
<L>The Gracious Mother in her Pangs was pleas'd:</L>
<L>But who can speak the Mighty Father's Joy?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Such was their Joy who by the Rainbow knew</L>
<L>The sinful World should delug'd be no more;</L>
<L>Such hers, who at the Blessed Virgins view</L>
<L>Perceiv'd the Mighty Prophet that she bore.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Hail then, Great <HI>Monarch,</HI> Parent of us all;</L>
<L>Glad Father of an Off-spring now more dear:</L>
<L>Permit me grov'ling at thy Feet to fall,</L>
<L>And shew my Hearts true Joy and Duty there.</L>

<L>No hollow Sounds of Temporizing Love,</L>
<L>Nor byass'd Duty taints my Loyal Breast;</L>
<L>A solid Faith does my Allegiance move;</L>
<L>And what I now, I always have exprest.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>Duty compell'd's an Artificial Cheat,</L>
<L>A Dull false Pebble clos'd in Metal base;</L>
<L>'Tis Inclination always best can set</L>
<L>A Gem so proper for a Monarch's Grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>A Loyalty, that Care nor yet Distress,</L>
<L>Nor Friends Allurements, Threats of Foes, nor Fear,</L>
<L>Not proffer'd Wealth, Reproof, nor yet Disgrace</L>
<L>Can alter, is the Gem we ought to wear.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>Since Kings can do no wrong, what strange Decree</L>
<L>Is that, which can Allegiance backward draw?</L>
<L>Duty Chief Point should of Religion be,</L>
<L>And an Obedience Passive should be Law.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>The Curr that snarls at Edicts of his King,</L>
<L>Methinks should streight set up a <HI>Monarch</HI> School;</L>
<L>And perfect in the knack of Governing,</L>
<L>Teach his Anointed Sovereign how to Rule.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>Desire him to give up his Regal Power,</L>

<L>Thus let the awful Lyon reign no more,</L>
<L>Because the Ass would vent his Politicks.</L>

<L>Let such as he repine at that blest day,</L>
<L>That gave this best of Blessings to our view;</L>

<L>To Heaven first, and then, Great Sir, to You.</L>

<L>Well have your strict Religious Vows been paid</L>
