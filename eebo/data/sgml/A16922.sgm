<HEAD>&cross;An Epitaphe declaryng the lyfe and end of <HI>D. Edmund Boner</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>_LO now the lingering hope is past, that late the Papistes had:</L>
<L>Their braggyng brests which boild in hate, their hartes with care haue clad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They looked long for wished tyme, of Antichristes returne:</L>
<L>When they in wonted wise might spoyle, and heapes of Martyrs burne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But s&eacute;e the prouidence of God, their malice to asswage:</L>
<L>He hath bereft these Papistes proud, the piller of their rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their whip, their sword, their fire brand, of wrath their chefest stay:</L>
<L>The spoyler of the Christian flocke, of whom he made a praye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For bloudy burnyng <HI>Boner</HI> now, hath made exchaunge of lyfe:</L>
<L>That whilesome was the murtherer, of infant, man, and wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet sometyme be a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">auorer, and did professe the troth:</L>
<L>Defiyng Pope and Popishnes, fiue tymes with solemne oth:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And letted not for to accuse, and note of haynous crime:</L>
<L>Such as were slacke to do the lyke, duryng Lord <HI>Cromwels</HI> tyme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A learned Epistle eke he wrat, in prayse and in defence:</L>
<L>Of Byshop <HI>Gardiners</HI> worke the booke, of true obedience.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wherin he doth accuse the Pope, his Churche and Romish rable:</L>
<L>Of haynous crimes right horrible, and deedes detestable.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As tyranny, vsurpyng state, reprochefull vnto God:</L>
<L>Of England eke a very spoyle, to Christ his flocke a rod.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He names the Pope a gr&eacute;edy wolfe, he ioyes in his decay:</L>
<L>Hopyng the truth long troden downe, at length should beare the sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He prayseth much the noble Prince, and calles <HI>K. Henry</HI> vertuous:</L>
<L>That in suppressyng Popish power, he is so studious.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wherby most playnly may appeare, how <HI>Boner</HI> had a tast:</L>
<L>Of Christ and of his Gospell pure, tho he them scorned at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>Denmarke</HI> eke Ambassadour, he published with sp&eacute;ede:</L>
<L>The booke and Epistle named before, as worthy workes in d&eacute;ede.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then sent Ambassador to <HI>Fraunce,</HI> from <HI>Henry</HI> puisaunt Kyng:</L>
<L>He furthered with fr&eacute;e consent, the English Bibles Printyng.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And caused diuers of the same, it semed of godly zeale:</L>
<L>For to be plast within Paules Church, Christes truth for to reueale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He causde fiue hundred Testamentes, be Printed, this I know:</L>
<L>And those as precious iewels did, vpon his frendes bestow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But as a wauering weather cocke, Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> beyng dead:</L>
<L>Forsaking Christ and all his lawes, to papistry he fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And of a <HI>Paule</HI> became a <HI>Saule,</HI> a <HI>Herode</HI> thirsting blood:</L>
<L>As on young <HI>Mekins</HI> well was sene, his cruell killing moode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For when one quest had cleard the boy, and iudgd him giltles quite:</L>
<L>He causd another Quest be cald, and him condemnd by might.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus draue he forth kyng <HI>Henries</HI> dayes, but when his noble sonne:</L>
<L>In fathers place to regall throne, by due desent was come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then cald to count for his offence, as iustice thought it fit:</L>
<L>In humble wise before the Lordes, himselfe he did submit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But afterward most stubburnly, with great contempt and scorne:</L>
<L>He did deny his former facte, as one, ere then forsworne,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For which offence in prison cast, where he with wealth was fedde:</L>
<L>Without regard of God or prince, a peruerst lyfe he ledde.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when in brothers sacred seate, God would Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Mary</HI> place:</L>
<L>This wilfull man from prison cald, by her especiall grace,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Abusing much the lenitie, and mercy of the Qu&eacute;ene:</L>
<L>Such bloody broyles began to brue, as earst was neuer s&eacute;ene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And lyke a roaring Lion he, of <HI>Plutoes</HI> poysoned band:</L>
<L>Made hauocke of the saintes of God, his Christ he did withstand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He trode his gospell vnder foote, as much as in him lay:</L>
<L>With tormoyle great, and torments huge, the Church he did affray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And pitie none would he alow, no mercy might him moue:</L>
<L>His broyling brest enflamed so, with popish fathers loue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With coales and candle light also, of some the bandes he brent:</L>
<L>Of some the haire, from of their face, with cruell clawes he rent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some men he beate vpon the face, but some, most like a beast:</L>
<L>He scourgd with whips &amp; rods (O wretch) that dede, all men detest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And breathing forth his tiranny, consumde with fire and flame:</L>
<L>The olde, the yong, the riche, the poore, the halt, the blinde, and lame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">hat should I say, my hart it rues, the peoples teares recorde:</L>
<L>The wayled woes for saintes so slayne, which is to be abhorde.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But all this might not moue his mynde, for witte gaue place to will:</L>
<L>Both grace and reason fled him fro, his hart was hardened still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when God of his prouidence, our famous Qu&eacute;ene did sende:</L>
<L>To stay the rage of tiranny, and wastfull wreakes to ende.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mercy of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> tho it doth farre exceede:</L>
<L>Could not reclaime his cureles hart, which errors still did f&eacute;ede.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But that he vsde vnreuerently, with scoffes in mocking wise:</L>
<L>Her graces high Commissioners, both worthy, graue, and wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when the people prayd for him, reprochefull wordes he gaue:</L>
<L>Most vile, not christianlike, as one that had a soule to saue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The second tyme to prison brought, where he his lyfe did leaue:</L>
<L>Where learned men persuaded him, vnto the truth to cleaue,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And flie the fancies of the fonde, wherwith he was abusde:</L>
<L>Unwilling still to heare them speake, good Councell he refusde.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So that vntill his dying houre, he shewed no perfect signe:</L>
<L>Of a repentaunt hart or mynde, that would from sinne decline.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But as he liude a lothed lyfe, vnconstant, vile, and vayne:</L>
<L>Forsaking faith and natures kynde, which God hath in disdayne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His glory aye the peoples griefe, the poore mans payne his pride:</L>
<L>(A wofull flocke where such a wolfe, appointed was for guide)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Euen so his ende was dolefull to, wherin did well appeare:</L>
<L>On him the iudgement iust of God, right wonderfull to heare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For dead his face as blacke as coale, and monstruous withall:</L>
<L>His grisly looke so terrible, as might a man appall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Was to the good a very glasse, wherin they all may learne:</L>
<L>To shunne, the way that <HI>Boner</HI> went, and better path deserne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet tho in lyfe he would not graunt, Christes mercy for to craue:</L>
<L>He wild his wretched Corps with pompe, brought should be to the graue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unto the Church whereas sometyme, a Prelate plast was he:</L>
<L>Euen there his solemne obsiquies, and funerals to be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But sith it was so farre vnm&eacute;ete, a place for him more fitt:</L>
<L>Within the Churchyard of <HI>S. George,</HI> he hath a homely pitt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And sith he loued not the light, but did the same despise:</L>
<L>At midnight was he buryed there, from vewe of peoples eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wherfore ye Papistes all beware, forsake this Romish whore:</L>
<L>And feare the Iudgementes of the Lord, which will you els deuoure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Recant ye all your heresies, and leaue your peruerse way:</L>
<L>Wherin you walkt so stubburnely, so long and many a day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Loue God, obey your soueraine, and pray for her estate:</L>
<L>Renounce ye all your Maummetry, least ye repent to late.</L>
