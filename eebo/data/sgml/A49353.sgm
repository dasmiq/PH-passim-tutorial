<HEAD>THE Loyal Martyr VINDICATED.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI>'s Paper had been shewn by the Sheriff to those that sit at the Helm, and that it was known there were more Copies of it given abroad, so that it was impos|sible to sham or disguise it, it raised in them (as I am in|formed) very sollicitous Apprehensions what Effects it was likely to work in the Minds of all the true Sons of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to see a genuine Member of that Communion, with his last Breath, admo|nish his prevaricating Brethren of the enormous Crimes of <HI>Perjury</HI> and <HI>Rebellion,</HI> in which they they had of late so deeply plunged themselves; denounce Prophetically to them the Judgments attending their Apo|stacy, if not timely repented of; profess so stoutly his Allegiance to his much injured and unjustly Dispossessed Prince; seal our Church's Doctrine of <HI>Non-resistance</HI> with his dearest Blood, and dye so resign|edly, chearfully, nay joyfully, in Testimony of that Christian Prin|ciple; could not but be apprehended to our Statis's to be the most powerful Motives imaginable, to <HI>reclaim</HI> those who had been <HI>misled</HI> by false Information, or seduced by Interest into a Repentance of their Errors; and to <HI>establish</HI> the rest in the Loyal Principles to which they had hitherto <HI>adhered.</HI> Besides, the honest unaffected Reason, which appears in the Account he gives of his Tenets, and Conscientious Pro|ceedings, and the Christian Moderation and sincere Piety, which he observed throughout his whole Paper, Praying heartily for his very Enemies, though unjustly thirsting after his Blood, (the proper Temper
<PB N="2" REF="2">
of a dying Martyr,) could not but <HI>recommend</HI> the Contents of it to the <HI>esteem</HI> of every <HI>indifferent</HI> Reader, and even be able to <HI>shock</HI> all such as were not <HI>resolutely byass'd.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can I blame them for being so highly concerned, that such a Le|gacy was left to the <HI>Loyal Party.</HI> Those politick Men were well aware of the successful Methods by which Christianity was <HI>Propagated</HI> at first, and that <HI>The Blood of the Martyrs was the Seed of the Church</HI>; and there|fore they judged it very Expedient, that some speedy and effectual Means should be taken to stop the prejudicial Effects, which it would otherwise produce. It was then thought the best way to seem to <HI>slight</HI> and <HI>undervalue</HI> the Paper, by Printing it <HI>themselves,</HI> and at the same time to endeavour to baffle and confute it by an Answer going along with it, penned with as much plausibleness as the Cause could bear: But Truth is not easily trampled down. His <HI>Christian Constancy</HI> has made too great an Impression in the Hearts of his Admirers, to per|mit his <HI>Meritorious Sufferings</HI> to lie under the Scandal of a <HI>Treasonable Guilt</HI>; and has given Courage to some of the meanest of them to vin|dicate his <HI>Cause,</HI> and <HI>Credit,</HI> against the <HI>wicked Slanders</HI> and <HI>weak Rea|sons</HI> of this mercenary Writer; though he foresees that if they be dis|covered, they can expect no other Reward but the same fatal End. The <HI>Holland Lyon</HI> has begun to taste <HI>English Blood,</HI> and finds it so sweet that it draws on an Appetite of shedding still more.</P>
<P>To fall then to our Reply&mdash;</P>
<P>His First Sham (for the whole Piece is a continu'd fardle of such Stuff) is, That the Paper is none of Mr. <HI>Ashton's.</HI> This, if made good, would (they hoped) take off the Authority and Influence of it, as no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> being the <HI>proper</HI> Act of the <HI>Martyr,</HI> but of some <HI>other</HI> of that Party <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it required therefore his best skill to make this Credible. Let us then examine his Arguments: His First Proof is, Because <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> with too much Art and Care to be the Work of one, who professes he thought it better to employ his last minutes in Devotion,</HI> (p. 8.) What a ridicu|lous Cavil is this! His <HI>last minutes</HI> were at the place of Execution which the Martyr professeth he thought it better to employ in <HI>Devo|tion and holy Communion with his God,</HI> than in making <HI>Speeches</HI>; which if they were <HI>Loyal,</HI> and delivered his Thoughts <HI>fully,</HI> were likely to be interrupted, and so <HI>not attended with the designed Success</HI>; and therefore he chose rather to deliver what he had to say in <HI>Writing.</HI> Now comes this Gentleman, and pretends (if his Words have any Tenour or Sense in them) that he must have compos'd this Paper of his <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his last mi|nutes,</HI> that is, <HI>at the Gallows</HI>; which, he says, he could not do with so much <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Care,</HI> those minutes being taken up <HI>otherwise,</HI> viz. In <HI>Devotion</HI>; and therefore (forsooth) the Paper is none of his: As if he had not time enough between his Sentence and the Execution of it to compose a Paper, both larger, and more full of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> (had he minded such Advantages) than this was: Or, as if good Men, whose <HI>Piety</HI> enclines them to spend their last minutes in <HI>holy Thoughts,</HI> could not in the time <HI>anteceding</HI> use both their best <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> to pen a true Account of their Principles, and the Cause for which they Suffered; but indeed there is <HI>little</HI> Art or Care in the <HI>Master,</HI> or <HI>Sense</HI> of the Paper, but a plain and candid Discovery of his Thoughts and Affec|tions
<PB N="3" REF="2">
both towards God, and the World; and as for the <HI>manner</HI> of Writing it (<HI>if it were indeed such as this Man exhibits it</HI>) there was neither any the <HI>least Art</HI> or <HI>Care</HI> shewn in it, but perfect <HI>Negligence,</HI> or rather great <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Folly</HI> throughout the whole, as will be seen shortly.</P>
<P>His Second Reason to prove the Paper was not the Martyr's, is, Be|cause Mr. <HI>Ashton,</HI> says he, was <HI>illiterate</HI> and <HI>unskilled in the Law,</HI> and yet uses such Bug-words, as <HI>Impending, Prevaricating, Premisses,</HI> and <HI>Consequence</HI>; and <HI>gives such a peremptory Iudgment about the Laws of the Realm, in a Case acknowledged by all ingenious Men of his own Party to have a great deal of difficulty in it</HI>; this Man will say any thing, though never so openly false: Not <HI>one M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> of his Party ever thought there was the least difficulty in this, That it was Treason by our Laws to resist a <HI>legal Prince,</HI> or acknowledge any other for <HI>King while he lives.</HI> No not this Writer himself, as appears by his not thinking it his best play to alledge the <HI>Laws of the Realm,</HI> bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> flying off and recur|ring to the <HI>Law of Nations</HI>: And as for the Law as it relates to his <HI>own</HI> Case, he was far from <HI>Peremptory,</HI> as is manifest from his saying&mdash;<HI>I am told I am the First Man that ever was condemned for High-Treason upon bare Presumption or Suspicion</HI>: Do not these Words [<HI>I am told</HI>] sound as <HI>modestly</HI> as is possible, and bar all shew of his passing such a <HI>peremptory Iudgment about the Laws of the Realm,</HI> as he puts upon him <HI>p.</HI> 8? What will not this Caviller say? But 'tis pleasant to observe what Prancks he uses all along. 'Tis plain Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI> meant no more but that he was <HI>illiterate</HI> (that is, unlearned) and <HI>unskilful in the Law,</HI> as appears by his desiring the <HI>Iudges</HI> to observe for <HI>him</HI> what might be for his Advantage. And sure a Man who has not <HI>made the Law his Study,</HI> (for the Word reaches no farther,) may have Learning enough to use those Four ordinary Words, none of them being artificial <HI>Law Terms</HI>; but such honest English as every Gentleman, that converses with Persons above the lowest Rank, is capable of understanding and using. But this
candid Gentleman seeing his Cause could not be main|tained but by Tricks, (for this whole turn of Government was nothing but a <HI>Trick of Policy,</HI>) disjoyns by his Discourse [<HI>illiterate</HI>] from [<HI>un|skill'd in the Law</HI>] and refers the Four cramp Words to the <HI>former,</HI> and his passing a <HI>peremptory Iudgment about our Laws</HI> to the <HI>latter</HI>; and when he has done, he tells us very sadly, <HI>one may justly wonder at it</HI>; and indeed it is very wonderful: For to play <HI>so many</HI> jugling Tricks in so <HI>little</HI> room, wresting almost every Word 'till he has made it <HI>crook|ed</HI>; and then gracing every Flam he gives us with such a <HI>demure Hy|pocrisie,</HI> is altogether <HI>Monstrous.</HI></P>
<P>He tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 9. That the <HI>Loyal Martyr</HI> design'd two Things. To <HI>assert his Principles,</HI> and to <HI>testifie his Innocency</HI>; and he sets himself to prove that he did <HI>neither.</HI> As for the former, he grants that <HI>by the Faith of the Church of</HI> England <HI>Mr.</HI> Ashton <HI>meant the Doctrine of Pas|sive Obedience</HI>; and then <HI>confutes</HI> him most learnedly, by telling us, That <HI>he suffered not for Passive Obedience but for want of it,</HI> and that <HI>had he regulated his Life by this Principle he had preserved it.</HI> Did ever any Man's Reason turn tail so aukwardly? The constant Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> was Passive Obedience to a <HI>lawful King</HI>; and he
<PB N="4" REF="3">
is the lawful King according to the Constitution of our Government, who has Title to it by <HI>immediate Succession.</HI> Now comes this acute Gentleman, and pretends, without Shame or Wit, that the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> is not Passive Obedience to the <HI>legal King,</HI> whom all the World did ever acknowledge for <HI>such,</HI> in their <HI>clear, un|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ass'd,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in us Thoughts,</HI> but to <HI>ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her,</HI> who has <HI>dispossest</HI> this legal King of his Kingdom, and whose Title is quite <HI>annulled</HI> by our <HI>English Laws,</HI> nor own'd by any but some of those who got their <HI>Ad|vantages</HI> in doing so, or who dare not do otherwise. And then after he had preva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icated thus eg egiously, he te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls us very gravely, That <HI>certainly there must be some g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mistakes about the Doctrines and Prin|ciples of our Church:</HI> Whereas if there be <HI>any</HI> 'tis manifestly on <HI>his</HI> side; but to say the plain Truth, there is <HI>no mistake</HI> at all, even on <HI>his</HI> side, but an open Prevarication, and a <HI>wilful</HI> shuffling and shifting the <HI>whole Subject</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Tenet, making our Passi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Obedience regard not only a <HI>wrong</HI> but an <HI>opposite Object,</HI> which is to make the Principles of our Church face ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut with the Times, and point (as a Weather-cock does to the Wind) to a <HI>Dispossessour</HI> of the true Prince; so he gets but Power enough to make himself a strong Party, and keep under, or <HI>Murther,</HI> by his new Laws, and new Judges, those who dare be Loyal.</P>
<P>He pretends that <HI>The Doctrines and Principles of our Church are to be found in the Articles and Constitutions of it.</HI> If he means that <HI>only some</HI> of them are found there, it reaches not home to his purpose. But if he means that <HI>All</HI> the Doctrines of Faith which our Church holds are found there, he shews himself to be very weak. Sure he cannot for|get that <HI>God's written Word,</HI> and it <HI>only,</HI> is our <HI>intire</HI> and <HI>adequate Rule of Faith</HI>; and that the best Interpreter of it for us to follow, is the most unanimous Exposition of it, avow'd by the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of our Church-men, and the agreeable and constant <HI>Practice</HI> of our Church. If then he would prove that our Church does <HI>not</HI> hold Passive Obedience, and Indispensable Allegiance to our lawful King upon our <HI>Rule of Faith,</HI> that is, does not hold it <HI>part of her Faith</HI>; he should have produced such, and so many genuine, grave, and eminent Members of one Church, as are <HI>beyond Exception,</HI> who have <HI>unanimously</HI> declared them|selves to understand the Scripture in an <HI>opposite</HI> Sense, and upon that ground held the contrary. I except always from that Number Dr. <HI>Sher|lock,</HI> who is so flexible a Complier with <HI>every</HI> side, that, I fear, he is of <HI>no</HI> side, and ready to be of <HI>any,</HI> as God-M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mmon shall inspire him by proposing a good fat Deanry, or some such irresistible Temptation. As for the <HI>Practice</HI> of our Church giving us light to know her <HI>Faith,</HI> it cannot be possibly manifested better than by her Carriage towards King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in the Protector's days, who had <HI>Abdicated twi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> (if the leaving <HI>England</HI> to avoid danger to his Person might be called Ab|dicating,) and there was another actual supreme Governor who had got all the Power into his Hands, and so was <HI>Providentially Settled in Dr.</HI> Sherlock's <HI>Sense</HI>; yet none of the genuine Sons of our Church flincht from their Allegiance to their King in those happy days, when honest Principles, as yet unantiquated, made our Church shine glori|ously even in the midst of Persecution, but all adher'd to their legal
<PB N="5" REF="3">
King, though all of them suffered in their Estates, and many lost their Lives rather than forego their Duty.</P>
<P>But as our Author told us formerly, that Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI> died for want of that Passive Obedience which the Church of <HI>England</HI> holds, so he tells us here, that he might have <HI>believed himself obliged by his Religion to look upon his rightful lawful Prince, (whatever his Principles were, or his Practices might be,) as God's Vicegerent, and accountable to God only from whom he received his Power: All this</HI> (says he) <HI>he might have done, and have been alive still,</HI> because, as he contends, King <HI>William</HI> was his rightful lawful Prince. So that it se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ms let King <HI>William</HI> be of what <HI>Principles</HI> he will, even though he were as zealous a <HI>Papist</HI> as King <HI>Iames</HI>; or let his <HI>Practices</HI> be what they will, even to the Subverting all our Liberties, Properties, nay the most Fundamental Laws of the Land, still we are to <HI>believe our selves obliged by our Religion to look upon him as on God's Vicegerent accountable to God only,</HI> and consequently to obey him as <HI>such.</HI> Which ridiculous Partiality overthrows a good part of his Book, and makes all the Deserters, and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st Adherers to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the whole <HI>Parliament</HI> that set him up for their King, and the <HI>Consent of the Nation,</HI> he talks of, to be <HI>Irreligious</HI> and <HI>Wicked.</HI> For since King <HI>Iames</HI> was confessedly at that time their <HI>right|ful lawful King,</HI> nor can he be pretended to have <HI>worse</HI> Principles and Practices than those mentioned, which comes within the compass of his, [<HI>whatever his Principles are, or his Practices might be,</HI>] and this Man confesses that notwithstanding <HI>all this they were obliged by their Re|ligion</HI> to submit to him as <HI>God's Vicegerent</HI>; it follows unavoidably, that we are to <HI>believe</HI> they <HI>violated</HI> the Principles of <HI>Religion,</HI> in the highest Degree, who <HI>deserted</HI> him, <HI>opposed</HI> him, turned him <HI>out,</HI> and <HI>set</HI> up a Stranger <HI>in his stead.</HI> Yet this Action of theirs, confest by himself to be <HI>Irreligious,</HI> is the true Foundation of our new Government.</P>
<P>Hitherto he has <HI>begged</HI> the whole Question, and <HI>supposed</HI> the present Governours to be <HI>rightful</HI> and <HI>lawful</HI> King and Queen; and now <HI>after</HI> he has done this, he sets himself to <HI>prove</HI> it: Certainly this Man's Logick is very extraordinary. If it might be <HI>supposed,</HI> it needed not to be <HI>proved</HI>; and if it could be well <HI>proved,</HI> it needed not have been <HI>supposed.</HI> Yet this Gentleman, to make this sure Work, will needs do <HI>both,</HI> though the Method he takes to do this be very <HI>preposterous,</HI> his special Gift of Reasoning, by a neat Figure called <HI>Hysteron Proteron,</HI> sets the Cart be|fore the Horse; and first <HI>supposes</HI> it, and then goes about to <HI>prove</HI> it: <HI>The Question,</HI> says he, (p. 9.) <HI>is not whether rightful lawful Kings are to be obeyed, but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o in our Circumstances is our rightful lawful Sovereign?</HI> And so he addresses himself to <HI>settle</HI> King <HI>William</HI>'s Title, and put it <HI>be|yond all disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te,</HI> which being so rare a Sight, and so great a Novelty and Curiosity, it may deservedly challenge our best Attention; especially it being withal our <HI>real-Interest</HI>: For I cannot think that any Man of the least degree of Wit, would undergo <HI>outward</HI> Disquiets, Dangers, and Inconveniences, in not submitting heartily to this present Government, if his Conscience would let him be <HI>quiet within:</HI> Let us see then what we in Reason and Conscience think of this <HI>new Title</HI> to what was most evidently, by <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d's</HI> and <HI>Man's</HI> Law too, <HI>another Man's Right.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">That Party that stickled to make the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> King, do hold that the <HI>People</HI> have the <HI>Power to make</HI> and <HI>unmake</HI> the supreme Magi|strate; and so they fix his Title upon <HI>the Creation of the People,</HI> and make account the same <HI>People</HI> by virtue of the same <HI>Power</HI> can <HI>limit</HI> his Authority, and annihilate it again, as one of them profest openly in the House of Commons: Nay, this was the only Reason and Interest they had, or could have to make him King; for the Commonalty, of whom they pretend to be the best Patrons, were not at all burthened with Taxes under King <HI>Iames</HI>; and withall themselves enjoy'd <HI>Liberty of Conscience</HI>; and, lastly, had more than should have fallen to their share in <HI>Places</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI>; And what could they wish more, except the pul|ling down <HI>Monarchy</HI> ten Pegs lower, and dwindling it into a <HI>Duke of Venice</HI>? Which could not be while the <HI>legal</HI> King governed; but might, they hop'd, be <HI>easily</HI> brought about when themselves had the <HI>making,</HI> and consequently the <HI>modelling</HI> of their new Magistrate: For 'tis but reasonable that they who give and <HI>bestow</HI> a Thing, should give <HI>as much</HI> and <HI>as little</HI> of it as they please. But this Plot was carried too openly, which obliged the House of Lords, fearing their Ruine by a Common|wealth, rather to vote any new <HI>King</HI> at a venture, than become Slaves to the <HI>People:</HI> Nor would a <HI>precarious</HI> Authority satisfie a <HI>Genius,</HI> that na|turally aimed at being <HI>Absolute.</HI> So when they had given all the Money that they thought could well be raised, without an <HI>extreme Wrong</HI> to the common Good of the People, they were <HI>packs away</HI>; and home they went gnashing their Teeth, that they should be so Silly as to bring themselves into a <HI>Noose</HI> they could not <HI>untie</HI>; and which in time might come to <HI>hang</HI> their <HI>Liberty, Property,</HI> and (if they should dare to mutter too rudely) their <HI>Persons</HI> too. Thus that <HI>First Title</HI> fell, which served well enough while the <HI>Young Government</HI> was yet in its <HI>Swaddling-clouts,</HI> but when it became <HI>bigger</HI> it <HI>out-grow</HI> it, as Chil|dren do their <HI>Cloaths.</HI></P>
<P>After this our Church of <HI>England</HI> Men, who all this while stood <HI>Trem|bling</HI> left this new King, being in his Inclination a perfect <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and the Creature of their Adversaries, should come to <HI>ever-power</HI> them, and <HI>trample</HI> on them, finding that Things did not co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on well between the ungrateful Sovereign, and these his disgusted Subjects, but that they grew weary of one another, judged it was now their time to strike in: Wherefore they offered him their most humble Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice; which being accepted, they laught in their Sleeves at the poor baffled <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> telling them after an upbraiding and scornful Manner, <HI>You would needs give us a King whether we would or no, and now we will keep him up whe|ther you will or no.</HI> So all this was done, not out of <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>him,</HI> (for he has the ill luck to have few <HI>Personal Lovers,</HI>) but for fear of the <HI>op|posite</HI> Party, and to <HI>secure</HI> themselves against their emulous Competi|tours, or <HI>revenge</HI> themselves upon them. If then <HI>Title</HI> (as it ought) be that which <HI>gives</HI> and <HI>upholds</HI> Authority; his <HI>best Title</HI> after he had now got rid of the hanck the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> had upon him, next to that of the <HI>Confederacy</HI> owning him for his Money and Assistance, (which now begins to knock off) was in reality, <HI>The Feud between our Church and Dissenters</HI>: Which Two made up a <HI>Second</HI> and a <HI>Third Title</HI> to <HI>prop</HI> up by turns this <HI>feeble</HI> Authority. Money then they voted him, and
<PB N="7" REF="4">
(to engratiate themselves by out-bidding the others) full thrice as much as the Dissenters had done; so that the Nation was half begger'd by his Transporting it beyond Sea, to <HI>hire</HI> Foreign Soldiers, and <HI>bribe</HI> the Confederates; and yet though they thus pleasured him by lavishing away the <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Riches</HI> of the Nation, all the Title he could obtain of them unanimously, was to be only King <HI>de Facto,</HI> and not <HI>de Iure.</HI> Which encouraged Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> who stood watching, his Advantage, to face about and build: this <HI>New</HI> and <HI>Fourth</HI> Title upon the <HI>Events of Providence,</HI> or (to use an Expression less blasphemous and more <HI>proper</HI> for a <HI>Rueling</HI> Authority) on the <HI>Wheel of Fortune.</HI> But the poor Man was so baffled for this new Notion of his, particularly by the Author of the <HI>Trimming Court Divine,</HI> and more largely and unanswerably by those two learned and acute Treatises, Entituled, [<HI>The Duty of Allegiance settled upon its true Grounds, according to Scripture, Reason, and the Opinion of the Church,</HI> and by Dr. <HI>Sherlock's Case of Allegiance considered with some Remarks upon his Vindication</HI>;] that 'tis his best play to sit down with <HI>silence,</HI> and be content to <HI>lull</HI> his Conscience with his Deanry, without <HI>awaking</HI> or <HI>disquieting</HI> it by thinking <HI>how</HI> to answer them, lest it start up in his Face, and disturb his peaceful and comfortable Enjoyments of his new Acquisitions; for I dare challenge him, particularly in the be|half of the two latter of those three Treatises; that he is so shamefully, confuted that he has not one starting-hole left for his Credit to escape by. And yet I must tell him, That unless he answers them <HI>fully,</HI> he <HI>Cheats</HI> the Government, and is bound in Conscience to make <HI>Restitution</HI> of his Deanry; For why should he be so bountifully paid for <HI>weaving</HI> a Piece, which, when it comes to be well lookt into, is so full of <HI>Bracks, Stains,</HI> and <HI>Holes,</HI> that 'tis useless and good for nothing?</P>
<P>Thus the Fourth Title of a King <HI>de Facto,</HI> by the <HI>Wheel of Fortune,</HI> was <HI>laid flat,</HI> and the <HI>Vnsteady</HI> Authority of our new Governours was bandied most miserably from Post to Pillar, and could find no Founda|tion to fix upon, nor any <HI>Basis</HI> that would <HI>fit</HI> it. None had hitherto been so Hardy to offer to maintain <HI>by Reason,</HI> that they were <HI>rightfull</HI> and <HI>lawfull</HI> King and Queen: Yet I am credibly informed that a certain Gloomy-look't Divine, relying, I suppose, on some mystick Exposition of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> had preached a Sermon which would insinuate that King <HI>William</HI> had a Right to <HI>England</HI> by <HI>Conquest</HI>; which was formerly ready to be published, but upon the taking of <HI>Mons</HI> some s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">op was put to it at that time. If this be as true as it is told me, with much assu|rance, we English-men have reason to bless God for that Success of the French King, as the most beneficial <HI>Event of Providence</HI> that has befall'n us this long time; for had that Project been heartily encouraged, our Countrey-men had been all <HI>Slaves,</HI> and every Farthing in the Nation at the <HI>Conquerour's</HI> Devotion, it being indeed, in <HI>that Case, his own</HI>; so that when Parliaments would <HI>give no more,</HI> he might, by setting up his Title, when he pleased, <HI>take all</HI>; and this was the <HI>Fifth Title</HI> which has been set on foot.</P>

by Force,</HI> or by making <HI>War</HI> on him that <HI>injures</HI> them: But, be|cause he saw no <HI>War</HI> was made, no <HI>Army</HI> fought, nor a <HI>Stroke</HI> struck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so that none who was not mad with Revelation could dream of a <HI>Con|quest</HI> giving him <HI>Right</HI> over <HI>England</HI>; he very politickly twists with it&mdash; and with the <HI>Success</HI> of this <HI>Iust War,</HI> (p. 11.) <HI>the Consent of the People</HI> too. This, I must confess, is a more extraordinary and more refined Notion than any of the other, 'tis made of Contradictions, and is of a Composition altogether Monstrous. We use to instance in <HI>Chimeras</HI> by a <HI>Hirco-cervus</HI> (a Goat-Stag) or some such whimsical Conceit, that imports two or more <HI>different</HI> Natures clapt together. But this new fangled Notion of Right, he has invented, consists not of merely <HI>diffe|rent,</HI> but <HI>opposite</HI> Natures; <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Force</HI> signifie <HI>Involuntariness</HI> in those they are exercised upon, and <HI>Consent</HI> signifies <HI>Voluntariness.</HI> Again, the Effect of <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Force</HI> is to <HI>subdue Resisters,</HI> and <HI>Consent</HI> of the whole <HI>Nation</HI> signifies <HI>no Resisters</HI> at all. So that to come in by <HI>Force</HI> of <HI>War,</HI> and at the same time by <HI>Consent,</HI> is to be <HI>beaten voluntarily,</HI> to be <HI>forced willingly,</HI> to <HI>resist yieldingly,</HI> to <HI>submit withall our Hearts, yet against our Will,</HI> or whatever Nonsense of this kind this <HI>incoherent</HI> and <HI>self-divided</HI> Notion of Right affords us. But, to say the Truth, there was neither a fair <HI>War,</HI> subduing the resisting Nation <HI>against</HI> their Consent, nor a clear, free, and deliberate Consent of the <HI>whole</HI> Nation; but (as will shortly appear) a mere <HI>Trick,</HI> manag'd by an Ambitious Invader, and his Confederates, seconded by a Party of <HI>Male-contents</HI> and <HI>Rebellious Deserters,</HI> and carried on by a complicated <HI>Series</HI> of <HI>unproved Pretences,</HI> and <HI>Forgeries,</HI> to <HI>bubble</HI> and <HI>fool</HI> the Common People, and bring us into the Slavery and Beggary we now groan under.</P>

<P>There is besides the <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Land</HI> (says he, p. 11.) a <HI>Law of Nations,</HI> by which Sovereign <HI>Independent-Governments,</HI> when injured, may <HI>Right</HI> themselves by a <HI>Iust War.</HI> Here were <HI>great and violent pre|sumptions of an injury to the Right of Succession,</HI> and <HI>too great Evidence</HI> of a formed <HI>Design to subvert the Establisht Religion and Civil Liberties of the Nation,</HI> and this <HI>War</HI> had <HI>Success</HI>; therefore the Sovereignty was duely <HI>transferred,</HI> and so <HI>there can be no dispute left to whom our Alle|giance is due.</HI> This is the full substance of the Discourse he had put to|gether, as he told us (<HI>p.</HI> 10.) <HI>to clear this whole Matter.</HI> Let us now take it gently to pieces, and lay each part of it down easily, lest it fall asunder of <HI>it self,</HI> and shatter into <HI>Incoherent</HI> Atoms before we come to handle it closely.</P>
<P>'Tis deny'd then, that there were in our Case <HI>two Nations,</HI> or <HI>several Independent Governments.</HI> 'Tis deny'd there were <HI>great and violent pre|sumptions</HI> of the <HI>Injury</HI> mentioned.

For&mdash;</P>
<P>Secondly, 'Tis deny'd that there were here <HI>Two Independent Go|vernments,</HI> and so his Discourse falls to the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound. The S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ates of <HI>Holland</HI> indeed make a <HI>Government,</HI> but those good Men, who never told lye in their Lives, disclaim'd the Action by their Ambassador; and, like wise Men, lest it should not succeed, would not be seen in it, but made use of <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot of W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elp</HI> to do their own Jobbs, 'till the Six hundred thousand Pound came to be pay'd them, and then indeed they so far <HI>own'd</HI> it heartily, and <HI>took our Money</HI> very readily: Besides they were <HI>Allies</HI> to King <HI>Iames,</HI> which makes it contrary to the <HI>Law of Nations,</HI> to which he recurrs. And, lastly, if they made this <HI>War,</HI> and had <HI>Suc|cess</HI> in it, (I am sure the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was not such an <HI>Independent Governour</HI> as to make it <HI>without them,</HI>) it would follow, by this Discourse that <HI>They,</HI> and not <HI>He,</HI> are our <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Masters</HI>; a <HI>Title</HI> which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do not <HI>qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> but still <HI>assert</HI> on due occasions, That <HI>their State-holder manages</HI> England <HI>for their behoof,</HI> as appears by their car|riage in the <HI>Mogull</HI>'s Countrey, where they seiz'd some of our Mer|chants Effects, by pretending <HI>that</HI> England <HI>was now under</HI> Holland, and that they had sent one of their own Officers to govern it <HI>on their stead.</HI> As for the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> taken in his own single Capacity, he was far from being a <HI>Separate Nation,</HI> or <HI>Independent Government,</HI> which this Gentlemen's Discourse proceeds upon, or indeed <HI>Supreme Governour of any Nation at all,</HI> not of the <HI>Principality of Orange</HI>; for this was by Dr. <HI>Sherlock's Event of Providence,</HI> and by <HI>Conquest</HI> taken from him long ago: Nor was the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> a <HI>Sovereign Independent</HI> Prince in <HI>Holland,</HI> for he was there <HI>under</HI> the Government of the States: Nor was it ever heard there was a Prince of <HI>Breda</HI>: So that this Gentle|man's Discourse faulters in that which should have been the very <HI>subject</HI> of it. He should have said that any <HI>great Man</HI> who had received <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ong,</HI> might in true Reason right himself by the best means that he or his Friends could make against <HI>any Man,</HI> who was not his <HI>Sovereign</HI> or <HI>fellow Subject,</HI> and this by the <HI>Law of Reason,</HI> or <HI>Nature,</HI> not by the <HI>Law of Nations</HI>; For what had the <HI>Law of Nations</HI> to do in the busi|ness, when there was no <HI>Nation Injured,</HI> or that demanded Satisfac|tion? For surely he will not say that King <HI>Iames</HI> had done Wrong to the Principality of <HI>Orange,</HI> or that the Person of King <HI>William alone,</HI> or of his Queen either, is a <HI>Nation</HI>: Yet one of the two he must say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o make his Discourse hang together.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="6">Thirdly, 'Tis deny'd <HI>there were great and violent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of an injury to the Right of Succession</HI>: This, if made good, might do his Cause some service; let us see then what strong Proofs he brings to evince it. Two sorts of Arguments he alledges to prove it. The fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st is the Prince of <HI>Orange's Declaration</HI>; certainly this Man is infatuated. Our English Proverb [<HI>Ask my Master if I be a Thief</HI>] contains as good a Plea as this; yet the poor Man triumphs mightily, and thinks his Work is done when he has <HI>barely repeated it.</HI> But what says the <HI>Declaration</HI>? Why, it says, That <HI>all the good Subjects of these Kingdoms do vehemently suspect, that the pretended Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>was not born of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ueen, and that many doubted of the Queen's Bigness, and of the Birth of the Child; and yet there was not any one Thing done to satisfie their Doubts:</HI> So says the Declaration indeed; and if a Man may be believ'd in his own Cause, (against our own knowledge,) when he might hope to get Three King|doms by saying so, all is as true as Gospel, and as clear as Demonstra|tion; otherwise our Reason will, I hope, give us leave to suspect at least <HI>Misinformation</HI> in the Case, if not <HI>Self-partiality.</HI> And I do not like either the Sincerity, or the Care of him that penned it, in saying, first that [<HI>All good Subjects vehemently suspected,</HI> &amp;c.] and then dwind|ling afterwards into [<HI>Many doubted,</HI> &amp;c.] A sober Man would not have quoted the Declaration, unless to defend it; but this Gentleman <HI>builds</HI> on it as on his <HI>Principle.</HI></P>
<P>But how will he justifie the Declaration when it says, that <HI>not any one thing was done</HI> to satisfie Doubters, or himself for hinting so impudent|ly, (p. 14.) That the <HI>principal Persons concerned had not the least Satis|faction given them?</HI> Was not the Testimony of near Fifty sworn Wit|nesses of Credit, enough to satisfie reasonable Men in <HI>a matter of Fact?</HI> No, says he, (p. 13.) <HI>No private Depositions of such as are dependents, or otherwise liable to suspicion, can in reason be taken for satisfactory Evi|dence.</HI> Does this Man consider how many Protestants, how many Per|sons of unblemish'd Honour he taints with <HI>suspicion</HI> of <HI>Perjury,</HI> and <HI>Treason</HI> against the Nation, by hinting they are <HI>so sworn</HI> in attesting the Bigness of the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een, and the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales?</HI> Un|happy Mr. <HI>Ashron,</HI> who had such Judges, and such Jury-men, as though fit to condemn him without <HI>any one</HI> Witness, or <HI>any one</HI> Proof, but merely upon <HI>Suspicion</HI> or <HI>Presumption</HI>; yet such multitudes of legal Wit|nesses are held insufficient to satisfie those of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame Party of the Truth of a matter of Fact far more evident. Certainly this pretended Scrupulosity of theirs, which is so <HI>loose</HI> at some time; and so <HI>strait|lac'd</HI> at another, is more lodged in their <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> than in their <HI>Reason</HI>: But on how he bussles, and runs about the World to pretend a flaw in this most sample Atte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tation! The <HI>Old Roman Laws</HI> are ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in by Head and Shoulders, (<HI>p.</HI> 13.) though he knows well they are generally no where observed, especially those he mentions; they being indeed such extra|vagant N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceties, that it would look like perfect Madness, now a days; to offer to bring them into play. Then comes in our <HI>Old Common Law,</HI> (p. 14.) <HI>Allowing a Writ of Inspection, and the Old Law Books giving directions to prevent and discover Subernation</HI>: Now if there were any Thing done contrary to our Laws, that makes for his purpose, Why

does he not produce it, and urge it? Especially why did not the Contention, when they were so vehemently press'd to it by the Loyal Party go about to <HI>Discover</HI> this pretended <HI>Subordination</HI>? Why did not they, or any other since this Government came in, make us of his Writs of <HI>Inspection,</HI> and his <HI>Chapter in the Old Law Books</HI>? Did none of them know <HI>Old Laws, W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">its</HI> and <HI>Chapters,</HI> but this learn|ed Setler of the Royal Succession? This I can assure him, that durst the Convention have attempted it they should have sound, <HI>even at that, time,</HI> very many <HI>other</HI> Witnesses of Credit, able both to satisfie the nicest Scrupulosity, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ute the Calumny, and confou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Authors and Abet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers of it.

I omit to give a fuller Answer to his <HI>Citations</HI> out of the <HI>Old Roman Laws,</HI> and <HI>our Old Common Laws</HI> because they have been considered very particularly, in a Discourse pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">posely made upon those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> subjects, Entituled, <HI>De Ventre I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">spiciendo,</HI> or <HI>Re|marks on Mr</HI> Ashron's <HI>Answerer</HI>; which shews clearly from those Laws themselves, in the places he cites, and from those Oracles of the Law, <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acton</HI> and my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> that neither the one, nor the other are at all to his purpose.</P>
<P>His other P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oofs of <HI>this injury</HI> justifying the War, are a compa|ny of [<HI>Its</HI>] as (pag. 13) <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> there was no reasonable Care taken to prevous and remove these Suspicions</HI>; and (pag. 14.) <HI>If no such Care was taken,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>If the principal Persons concerned had not the least Sa|tisfaction given them.

But he no where <HI>affirms,</HI> that all the particular [<HI>Ifs</HI>] or any <HI>one</HI> of them was <HI>positively</HI> true; and consequently he attempts not to make good, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffers the <HI>least</HI> Proof, that the War upon this Score was <HI>Iust</HI>; nor that the <HI>Law of Nations,</HI> he so much talks of, gives the Invader any Right or Title to the Crown; nor, lustly, that <HI>there were great,</HI> and (as he only phrases it) <HI>violent Presumptions</HI> of this <HI>Injury to the Right of Succession</HI>: Whence follows, that he has not even <HI>said one</HI> single Word in ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">fication of this <HI>New Government,</HI> or of the <HI>Swearing Party</HI>; and so he is infinitely short of <HI>clearing the whole Matter,</HI> as he, in big Words, pretended at the beginning of this Discourse. Certainly our Governours were either very unwise in clinsing no better a W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iter to <HI>defend their Cause,</HI> or else (which is the very Truth) their Cause it self can <HI>bear no better a Defence.</HI></P>

<P>An impartial Narrative of matters of Fact known to most in <HI>En|gland,</HI> will give us a true Light to judge of this Point. King <HI>Iames</HI> his Religion and the hatred which the generality of the Nation had against it, made all those who were of a different Persuasion look with a <HI>jealous</HI> Eye upon his Actions, and apt to make the <HI>worst</HI> Constructions of every thing he did, in favour of Papists: Nor is it to be thought that he wanted many Enemies of the Old <HI>Excluding Faction,</HI> who stood watching all Opportunities to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed him Vexation, and disaffect his Subjects by malicious Insinuations. Those of our Church who were heartily Loyal, did grieve exceedingly to see him give his Enemies <HI>too fair</HI> occasions to work him Mischief: They judged that the setting up the High Commission Court over Ecclesiasticks, were there nothing in it but the Novelty of it, should not have been attempted in such Circum|stances <HI>if at all.</HI> The making one of the <HI>Iesuits</HI> (Men more odious to our Nation than <HI>Turkish M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sties</HI>) a Privy-Counsellor, could, they fear'd, have no other likely Effect, but to exasperate all <HI>England</HI> to the highest degree. They conceived that the <HI>Dispensing</HI> with the <HI>Test,</HI> and putting Roman-Catholicks promiscuously into Offices Civil and Military, might have been let alone 'till the <HI>Test</HI> it self were Abrogated; which would certainly have been more easily obtained, had not this forward Anticipation put our Church of <HI>England</HI> out of humour, and made them more warily stand upon their Guard, and resolve unani|mously to part with nothing that could any way he likely to advantage them: But that which most <HI>Startled</HI> our Church, was the Design of giving Liberty of Conscience to all Dissenters; they had sadly expe|rienced in the long Parliament's Time, and in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Days, how those Men had trampled the Church of <HI>England</HI> under Foot, and they feared that this setling them by Law, on an <HI>even level</HI> with themselves, might in time give those restless Men opportunity to play the same Franks over again. In a Word, they apprehended they were to fence with their Enemies on both hands, and therefore they combined&mdash;<HI>Veleus Testindine fact&acirc;</HI>&mdash; to link themselves unanimously against the <HI>universally D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pensing</HI> Power, and in Maintenance of the Test.</P>
<P>On the other side, King <HI>Iames</HI> was very earnest to have a <HI>general Li|berty of Conscience</HI> setled by Law. It had ever been his Tenet, that Persecution purely for Conscience sake was <HI>Vnchristian</HI>: Besides, he judged it would <HI>enrich</HI> the <HI>Nation,</HI> as it had done <HI>Holland,</HI> by inviteing Strangers hither, and encouraging Trade; the conveniency of our Ports, above those of our Neighbours, being an efficacious Motive to draw the Traffick from <HI>them</HI> to <HI>us.</HI> He judged too that this universal Toleration, if wisely setled and managed, might be a means to com|pose the Bedlam Animosities here about Religion, which had so often distracted the Nation, and, within our Memory, turned the Govern|ment topsie-turvy&punc; Nor was it one of his <HI>least</HI> Motives (though not the <HI>only</HI> one, as some apprehended) to gain those of his own Religion a Toleration among the rest of the Dissenters; a thing (to speak im|partially)
<PB N="16" REF="9">
to which both his <HI>Honour</HI> and his <HI>Conscience</HI> could not but exceedingly encline him. These Conveniences meeting in one, took such full hold of his Judgment, that he was exceedingly <HI>fond</HI> of a Pro|ject, which did seem to him so hugely Advantageous to the <HI>Nation.</HI> Hereupon he try'd all <HI>Sweet means</HI> imaginable to bring it about&punc; but found all his <HI>Caresses</HI> ineffectual to induce our Church Party to permit it to be enacted in Parliament, which was his main design: Wherefore he saw there was no other Expedient, but to turn out such Officers as <HI>opposed</HI> his Intentions, and (<HI>for the present</HI>) to put in <HI>Dissenters</HI> to whom he knew it would be grateful, and by that means to compass such a Parliament, as was likely to establish this Liberty of Conscience by <HI>Law.</HI> He hop'd it would not much displease our Church, since he <HI>de|clared</HI> he would continue to them the Prerogative above others to be still the <HI>State-Religion</HI> established by Law, to enjoy all the <HI>Bishopricks</HI> and <HI>Benefices,</HI> and by that means to have vast Priviledges a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Advan|tages over any others whatsoever: But they were jealous that this was not sufficient to secure them for the future.

<P>Now all this while, What had K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng <HI>Iames</HI> done to make his <HI>Son in Law,</HI> and his <HI>own Nephew,</HI> nay his own <HI>Daughter,</HI> turn their Father out of his Kingdoms?

<P>As for what King <HI>Iames</HI> is pretended to have done in prejudice of our <HI>Civil Liberties,</HI> which required the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s over-chari|table vindicating them: He was told by his Judges that it was his <HI>due Prerogative</HI>; and suppose he had something extended <HI>that,</HI> why should this oblige a <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Daughter</HI> to invade a <HI>Father</HI>? Had he <HI>beggar'd</HI> the Nation by <HI>Heavy Taxes,</HI> it had been worse for them when <HI>their</HI> turn came to enjoy it. But to magnifie the <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al Prerogative</HI> had been a <HI>high Benefit</HI> to them, especially in a Nation which was in great part of Com|mon-weal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hish Principles, and ought to have been esteemed <HI>meritorions.</HI> Again: The greatest Encroachment upon our Civil Liberties that was objected, was the Dispensing <HI>universally</HI> with the Laws against the Dis|senters, whence it was inferred, he might by the same Reason dispense with any <HI>other</HI> Law, or suspend the Execution of it, and then adieu to our <HI>Civil Liberties.</HI> But it ought to be remembred, that when he did this, he <HI>declared</HI> his Judgment at the same time, what it estimable <HI>Com|mon Goods</HI> it would being to the Nation, (which cannot be pretended the Dispensing with any other Law whatsoever,) and he judged him|self to be by his Office, as indeed he was, <HI>Ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">seer of the Common Good.</HI> It may be remembred, that it enrich'd not <HI>himself,</HI> but rather <HI>impove|rished</HI> him; for he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st the <HI>Fines</HI> and <HI>Forfeitures</HI> raised upon Conventi|cles: So that 'tis manife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> he aimed onely at the Common Good of the People, and not at his <HI>own private Interest</HI>; and therefore if he had er|red, it ought to have been very pardonable, and not have been made such a heinous Fault, as deserv'd an <HI>Invasion,</HI> and the <HI>Loss</HI> of his <HI>Crown.</HI></P>
<P>Again: If King <HI>Iames</HI> over-reach'd, it was in order to get Universal Liberty of Conscience settled by Law, which suiting so exactly with the Dutch Methods could not, to a Dutch Prince, be a <HI>just Ground</HI> for such an <HI>Vnnatural Quarrel</HI>; especially since it was intended to take the Grie|vous Yoke of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Laws from off the Necks of those of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Persuasion; which being the Religion that Prince had espoused, and been bred up in, it ought rather to have <HI>obliged</HI> him, than have <HI>exasperated</HI> him so highly as to draw his Sword at his <HI>Father.</HI> This Prete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce then of <HI>maintaining our Civil Liberties,</HI> and of Justifying the War upon that score, is so open a Sham past upon us poor English Gulls, that it gives it self the Lye, even from the Principles of our New Governours themselves.</P>

<P>But was there indeed a <HI>free Consent of the People</HI>? Let us see.

Now the Common People were <HI>bubbled</HI> at that time with a Thousand <HI>Lyes</HI> about the Prince of <HI>Wales, Smithfield</HI>-Fares, a League made with <HI>France</HI> to enslave us all; nay, that we were all sold to the French King, and in Danger to have all our Throats cut by him: They <HI>conserted</HI> then upon such <HI>Suppositions,</HI> not <HI>absolutely</HI>; and so these Suppositions being found to be false, their <HI>true Reason consented not,</HI> but they were surprized, terrified, and ama|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed into a false grounded Passion, which made them in a hurry doe they <HI>knew not what</HI>; whereas the most sedate Deliberation, and most true Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esentation of things is requisite to such a <HI>Free Consent,</HI> as submits all the Subjects <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Fortun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> to the maintaining this New Governour in the Throne, as they must do, whoever own their Alle|giance <HI>due</HI> to him.</P>
<P>At least he will say the <HI>Convention</HI> represented the Nation, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e consented,</HI> and that's enough. I deny all Three. It was neither a <HI>Le|gal</HI> Representative, and so let it Vote what it will it <HI>binds no Man,</HI> nor consequently is it enough for his Purpose: Nor did the People who chose the Commons intend to empower them to <HI>alter</HI> the most fundamental Law of the Land, and make a <HI>New</HI> King as they pleased. Besides, if they would needs do it, they ought to have first repealed the Laws for the Royal Succession, and all those other Laws too which make it Treason to obey or acknowledge any other but the immediate Successour for their King; otherwise those Laws, yet standing, whatever was done against them was beyond all Excuse <HI>ille|gal</HI> and <HI>treasonable</HI> in the highest Degree. Nor, lastly, did the Conven|tion <HI>unanunorisly</HI> and <HI>freely consent.</HI> The Common-wealth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh Party could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to bring in a <HI>New</HI> King, while the Old one was Alive, and had not <HI>resigned.</HI> Being thus at a loss, when they had <HI>computed</HI> the Number of their Faction, who they knew would vote <HI>any thing,</HI> they put the King's <HI>Abdication</HI> to vote: It was carried, though it was such a Piece of bold Impudence as was, at <HI>another time,</HI> (and will be for <HI>all future Ages</HI>) enough to make all the Convention held <HI>Mad|men.</HI> The King was commanded out <HI>of</HI> his Palace to a Prison, and all Treaty with him refused, and so, being made justly apprehensive by his Father's Fate, he had retired for his Safety; but well foreseeing
<PB N="20" REF="11">
the ambitious Drift of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> He, both by his Letter from <HI>Rochester,</HI> and divers others afterwards, particularly in that to the Lords, both <HI>claimed</HI> the Government, <HI>challenged their Allegiance,</HI> desi|red them to prepare things for his safe Return, and signified he would be within Convenient distance, to receive and answer their Proposals: He told them the Right was <HI>His,</HI> and bid them remember, that <HI>none</HI> but <HI>Himself</HI> was or could be their <HI>Sovereign.</HI></P>
<P>Besides: It was fresh in every Man's Memory, how his Royal Bro|ther King <HI>Charles</HI> had retired also for his Safety, <HI>continued</HI> many Years out of <HI>England</HI>; yet no Man living ever thought, nor were his very <HI>Ene|mies</HI> so senseless and shameless as to object, that he had <HI>Abdicated</HI> his Crown: Yet notwithstanding all this, and in despight of common Sense, <HI>Claiming</HI> was called <HI>Abdicating,</HI> and the <HI>Challenging</HI> their Allegi|ance was voted <HI>Renouncing</HI> it: They might better have voted; that the <HI>Huntington</HI> Colt, driven down to the Bridge at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> was a Sturgeon; that an <HI>Apple</HI> is an <HI>Oyster</HI>; or that <HI>Chalk</HI> is <HI>Cheese</HI>; for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se are onely <HI>different</HI> Things, not <HI>directly</HI> Opposites, as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the <HI>other.</HI> No Wonder then it cost the Factious Party such Sweat and Toil to get such a damnable Contradiction enacted: Such a Solliciting, Cajolling, Frigh|ting! Such Hurry and Clamour, [<HI>Make him King, make him King,</HI>] enough to put sober Mankind out of its Senses! Besides; a Dutch Ar|my <HI>over-awing</HI> them, and the <HI>Fear</HI> of being accused afterwards to the New King as disaffected to him, which considering his Humour, im|patient of Opposition in a pretence he was violently bent upon, might either prove their <HI>Ruine,</HI> or at least make them live very <HI>uneasie</HI> un|der him.</P>
<P>Take one short but very significant Instance, how things were car|ried in those Mad Days, as it was related by a Noble Pee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (who was himself very forward for the Abdication) to his Friends upon occasion. There being no Judges yet appointed, there was a Debate in the Con|vention, what Gentlemen of the long Robe should be made choi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of to assist in the House: Some named Sir <HI>Francis Pemberton,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Sawyer,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Finch</HI>; but the Lords <HI>Mordant, Delamere,</HI> and some others, took Fire suddenly, and brake out into big and boisterous Lan|guage, telling the House flatly and plainly, [<HI>We will have none of those who have been Instruments in the late Reign:</HI>] Upon which a sudden Damp seized all the Lords, as if they had been attackt in Flank and Rear with Canons and Mortars, or the Thunder from Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>: <HI>For we lookt on them,</HI> said that Lord, <HI>as on so many Princes of</HI> Orange, <HI>or such as might not be contradicted for fear of his Displeasure; and in the same Manner most Votes were forced, till we had the Grace to be pliable to what the Military Lords and their Complices proposed.</HI> Is not this a strange kind of <HI>free Consent,</HI> when the Heads of the Faction did <HI>All</HI> at their Pleasure, and the rest, who made up the Generality, durst do <HI>Nothing at all,</HI> but what was agreeable to the Arbitrary Will of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and his insolent Adherents?</P>
<P>And yet though their own Party was so great, and had all those Ad|vantages to back them, they were able to carry it but by a very few Votes, as appears by the Catalogues of each. And which gives a grea|ter Blemish in the House of Lords, than it had Advantage in the House
<PB N="21" REF="11">
of Commons, Six Dukes, and Thirty Lords <HI>protested</HI> solemnly against it, and their Protestations stand yet upon <HI>Record</HI>: And the Generali|ty of the others admitted it, because they judged it would be a Ruine to themselves, and withall worse for King <HI>Iames,</HI> if the Government should settle into a Common-wealth, than if they should keep up Mo|narchy, by setting up a King <HI>de Facto</HI> at present, which is all they in|tended at first, as divers of them have declared privately to those Friends they durst trust; though now they are carried down by the Current of the Times into many Treasonable Actions, contrary to their first Intentions. So dangerous is it to <HI>recede</HI> from <HI>Principles,</HI> in Compliance with any <HI>present Circumstances</HI> whatever.</P>
<P>Seeing then all this whole Turn of our State depends upon the <HI>Ab|dication Vote,</HI> as on its <HI>Bottom</HI> and sole Foundation, and no King was chosen, but in <HI>Supposition</HI> of King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Relinquishing, and volun|tary divesting himself of his Crown, it follows, that the <HI>True Ground</HI> of King <HI>William</HI>'s <HI>Right to the Government,</HI> is a piece of <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re Nonsense,</HI> which we English Men call a <HI>Bull</HI>: And therefore since none of the many minded Writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, who have gone about to settle his Authority, have light on this <HI>Seventh</HI> and <HI>truest</HI> Title of his, I thought it fit to let them know it, that all his Friends may adore this <HI>mysterious</HI> Monster, this <HI>Bull</HI>; and in their Devotions cry aloud, <HI>These are the Gods that brought our</HI> Israel <HI>out of the Land of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>out of the House of Bon|dage</HI>; <HI>i.e.</HI> from under the <HI>Government of King</HI> James. And for not thinking this <HI>Bull</HI> to be rational, and falling down and adoring it, our <HI>Loyal Martyr</HI> suffered.</P>
<P>But to put an upshot to this whole Business: Let any Man who has but Eyes, and common Sense, peruse these following Letters of <HI>King Iames</HI>'s to the <HI>Lords of the Council,</HI> and the House of <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Com|mons,</HI> and he must, whether he will or no, plainly see how prodigious|ly senseless this pretence is of that King's Abdication, on which, (and which onely) the Convocation grounded their <HI>Dethroning</HI> him, and <HI>Setting</HI> up the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> in his stead.</P>

<SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHen We saw that it was no longer Safe for Us to remain within Our Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and that thereupon We had taken Our Resolutions to withdraw for some time. We left to be Communicated to You and to all Our Subjects, the Reasons of Our withdrawing: And were likewise resolved, at the same time, to leave such O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ders behind Us to You of Our Privy-Council, as might best suit with the present State of Affairs: But that being altogether Unsafe for Us at that time; We now think fit to let you know, that though it has been our con|stant Care since Our first Accession to the Crown, to govern Our People with that Justice and Moderation, as to give, if possible, no occasion of Complaint; yet more particularly upon the late Invasion, seeing how the Design was laid, and fearing that Our People, who could not be destroy'd but by themselves, might by little imaginary Grievances be cheated into a certain Ruine. To prevent so great Mischief, and to take away, not only all just Causes, but even pretences of Discontent, We freely and of Our own accord redressed all those Things that were set forth as the Causes of that Invasion: And that We might be in|formed by the Counsel and Advice of Our Subjects themselves, which way We might give them a further and a full Satisfaction, We resolved to meet them in a Free Parliament; and in order to it, We first laid the Foundation of such a Free Parliament, in restoring the City of <HI>London,</HI> and the rest of the Corporations to their ancient Charters and Priviledges; and afterwards actually appointed the Writs to be issued out, for the Parliament's Meeting on the Fifteenth of <HI>Ianuary:</HI> But the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeing all the Ends of his Declaration Answered, the People beginning to be undeceiv'd, and returning apace to their ancient Duty and Allegiance, and well foreseeing that if the Parliament should meet at the time appointed, such a Settlement, in all probability, would he made both in Church and State, as would totally defeat his Ambitious and Unjust Designs, resolved by all means possible to pre|vent the Meeting of the Parliament. And to do this the most effec|tual way, he thought fit to lay a restraint on Our Royal Person, for as it were absurd to call that a Free Parliament, where there is any force on either of the Houses, so much less can that Parliament be said to act freely wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re the Sovereign, by whose Authority they meet and sit, and from whose Royal Assent all their Acts receive their Life and Sanc|tion, is under actual Confinement. The hurrying of Us under a Guard from Our City of <HI>London,</HI> whose returning Loyalty We could no longer

Trust, and the other Indignities We suffered in the Person of the Earl of <HI>Feversham,</HI> when sent to him by Us; and in that Barbarous Con|finement of Our own Person We shall not here repeat, because they are, We doubt not, by this time very well known, and may, We hope, if enough considered and refl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted upon, together with his other Violations and Breaches of the Laws and Liberties of <HI>England,</HI> which by this Invasion he pretended to restore, be sufficient to open the Eyes of all Our Subjects, and let them plainly see what every one of them may expect, and what Treatment they shall find from him, if at any time it may serve his Purpose, from whose Hands a Sovereing Prince, an Uncle, and a Father, could meet with no better Entertainment. However, the Sense of these Indignities, and the Just Apprehension of further Attempts against Our Person, by them who already endea|voured to murder Our Reputation by infamous Calumnies, (as if We had been capable of supposing a Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI>) which was incom|parably more Injurious than the Destroying of Our Person it Self; to|gether with a serious Reflection on a Saying of Our Royal Father, of blessed Memory, when he was in the like Circumstances, <HI>That there is little distance between the Prisons and the Graves of Princes,</HI> (which afterwards proved too true in his Case,) could not but persuade Us to make use of that which the Law of Nature gives to the meanest of Our Subjects, of freeing Our Selves by all means possible from that un|just Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ment and Restraint. And this We did not more for the Security of Our own Person, than that thereby We might be in a bet|ter Capacity of transacting and providing for every Thing, that may contribute to the Peace and Settlement of Our Kingdoms: For, as on the one hand, <HI>No Change of Fortune shall make Vs forget Our Selves, so far as to cond sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd to any Thing unbecoming that High and Royal Station, in which God Almighty by Right of Succession has placed Vs:</HI> So on the other hand, neither the Provocation or Ingratitude of Our own Sub|jects, nor any other Consideration whatsoever, shall ever prevail with Us to make the least step contrary to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">erest of the English N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; <HI>Which we ever did, and ever must lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k upon as Our own.</HI> Our Wall and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">sure, therefore is, That You of Our Privy-Council, take the most effectual Care to make these Our gracious Intentions known to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, in and about our Cities of <HI>Lon|don</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> to the Lord Mayor and Commons of Our City of <HI>London</HI> and to all Our Subjects in general.

<P><HI>WE think Our Selves obliged</HI> in Conscience <HI>to do all We can to open Our Peoples</HI> Eyes, <HI>that they may see the true Interest of the Na|tion in this</HI> Important Conjuncture; <HI>and therefore We think fit to let you know, that finding We could no longer stay</HI> with Safety, <HI>nor act</HI> with Freedom <HI>in what concerned</HI> Our People, <HI>We left the</HI> Reasons <HI>of Our Withdrawing under Our own Hand,</HI> in the following Terms.</P>
<P>THe World cannot wonder at My Withdrawing My Self <HI>now this Se|cond time</HI>; I might have expected somewhat <HI>better Vsage</HI> after what I writ to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> by my Lord <HI>Feversham,</HI> and the <HI>Instructions</HI> I gave him; but instead of an Answer, such as I might have hop'd for, what was I to expect after the Usage <HI>I received,</HI> by his making the said Earl a <HI>Prisoner</HI> against the <HI>Practice and Law of Na|tions; The sending his own Guards at Eleven at Night to take Possession of the Posts at</HI> White-hall, without Advertising Me in the least manner of it; <HI>The sending to Me at One a Clock after Midnight, when I was in Bed, a kind of an Order by Three Lords to be gone out of My own Pallace before Twelve the next Morning.</HI> After all this, How could I hope to be <HI>Safe,</HI> so long as I was in the Power of one, who had not only done this to Me, and <HI>Invaded</HI> My Kingdoms, without any just occasion gi|ven him for it, but that did by his <HI>First Declaration</HI> lay the greatest
<PB N="25" REF="13">
Aspersion on Me, that Malice could invent, in that Clause of it which concerns <HI>My Son</HI>? I appeal to all that know Me, <HI>nay, even to himself,</HI> that in their Consciences, <HI>neither he nor they,</HI> can believe Me, in the least, capable of so <HI>Vnnatural a Villany,</HI> nor of so little common Sense to be imposed upon, <HI>in a Thing of such a nature as that:</HI> What had I then to expect from one, who by all Arts hath taken such pains to make Me appear <HI>as black as Hell to My own People,</HI> as well as to all the World <HI>besides</HI>? What Effect that had at Home all Mankind have seen, by so general a <HI>Defection</HI> in My Army, as well as in the Nation, amongst all sorts of People.</P>
<P>I was born Free, and desire to continue so; and though I have <HI>ven|tured My Life very frankly,</HI> on several occasions, for the <HI>Good and Honor of My Countrey,</HI> and am as free to do it again, <HI>(and which I hope I shall yet do, as Old as I am, to redeem it from the Slavery it is like to fall un|der,)</HI> yet I think it not convenient to expose My Self to be Secured, as not to be at Liberty to effect it; and for that Reason <HI>do withdraw,</HI> but so as to be within Call, whensoever the Nations Eyes shall be opened, so as to see how they have been <HI>Abused and Imposed upon</HI> by the specious Pre|tence of Religion and Property. I hope it will please God to touch their Hearts, out of his infinite Mercy, and to make them sensible of the ill Condition they are in, and bring them to such a Temper, <HI>That a legal Parliament may be called</HI>; and that amongst other Things, which may be necessary to be done, they will agree to Liberty of Conscience for <HI>all Protestant Dissenters</HI>; and that those of My own Persuasion may be so <HI>far considered,</HI> and have such a share of it, as they may live Peace|ably and Quietly, as <HI>English-men and Christians ought to do,</HI> and not to be obliged to transplant themselves, which would be very grievous, especially to such as love their <HI>own Countrey:</HI> And I appeal to all Men, <HI>who are Considering Men,</HI> and have had Experience, Whether any thing can make this Nation so Great and Flourishing, as Liberty of Conscience? Some of Our Neighbours dread it.</P>
<P>I could add much more to confirm all I have said, but now is not the proper time.</P>

<P>But to return to our Discours<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash; Such a <HI>free Consent,</HI> as suf|fices in this Case of transferring a <HI>Kingdom</HI> and the <HI>All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">giances</HI> of all their fellow Subjects, ought to have been <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>whole</HI> Nation, <HI>una|nimous, hearty,</HI> and most <HI>deliberate,</HI> not done in a sudden <HI>heat,</HI> not <HI>check'd</HI> nor <HI>overaw'd,</HI> not <HI>protested against</HI>; especially it ought to have been grounded, at least, upon good tolerable Sense; all which were here wanting. This in case their <HI>free Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt</HI> could do the Work: But let their Consent be the best qualified in the World, it can never be suf|ficient for this purpose; for no Consent of those who have no <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght</HI> to
<PB N="28" REF="15">
a Thing, though it were never so <HI>free,</HI> is able to give away <HI>another Man's</HI> Title, who is known to have had a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>undoubted Right</HI> to it. Well, May a Conspiracy of my Servants, Tenants, and of my Chil|dren joyned with them, have the Power to <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive</HI> or <HI>fright</HI> me out of my <HI>House</HI>? But not <HI>all</HI> these together, though never so <HI>many,</HI> can <HI>give</HI> away that <HI>Right,</HI> which <HI>the Laws of the Land,</HI> and in our Case <HI>God's Law</HI> too, have made my <HI>Property.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much for his new Coined Notion of <HI>Right by the Law of Na|tions,</HI> own'd by <HI>none</HI> but this singular Writer, who seeing <HI>all</HI> other Titles of this upstart Government <HI>baffled,</HI> was forc'd, for a shift, to recurr to this Whimsie. But since he was pleased to decline the Law of the Land, and run to a <HI>Superior Law,</HI> (viz.) that of <HI>Nations,</HI> we shall take leave to mind him (for He and his Party seem to have quite <HI>forgot</HI> it, or rather indeed to <HI>out-brave,</HI> and <HI>laugh</HI> at it) of the <HI>Su|preme Law of all,</HI> the <HI>Law of God,</HI> which commands us to <HI>Honour our, Father and Mother,</HI> and not to <HI>covet,</HI> much less to <HI>rob</HI> or <HI>cheat</HI> another; and least of all so near, and so <HI>Revered a Relation,</HI> of what is <HI>rightfully</HI> his. Let us consider then what Good and Conscientious Christians would have done in the Case of the Prince, and Princess of <HI>Orange.</HI> For, First, If their Party, with their Consent or Connivance, invented those Stories, which he makes the <HI>just Occasion of the War,</HI> on purpose to turn out their Father, it was in many regards the most hideous, and the most villanous Injustice that can be imagin'd. Secondly, If those Falshoods were suggested to them by <HI>others,</HI> they knew the <HI>Genius</HI> of the English Subjects was apt to <HI>raise</HI> and <HI>believe</HI> the most Senseless Falshoods of him out of hatred to his <HI>Religion</HI>; and so they ought to have considered, that there was <HI>no</HI> kind of Evidence of this Story, nor so much as <HI>one</HI> Witness, that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was a Counterfeit, nor (as appears by their <HI>not producing</HI> it in their Justification when it was so necessary) <HI>any one</HI> tolerable <HI>Reason,</HI> able to persuade a prudent Man, the Thing was <HI>true</HI>: Whereas, on the other side there were, as was said, near Fifty Sworn Witnesses of clear Honour and Reputation testi|fying the contrary, any Two or Three of whom were sufficient to carry the greatest Estate, or take away the Life of any Man in <HI>England.</HI> They knew too, that if the <HI>pretended</HI> Injury done to them were not <HI>really true,</HI> they must incurr the dreadful Indignation of a just God, for breaking divers of his Commandments, in that one Action, by <HI>Dishon|ouring, Injuring,</HI> and <HI>Slandering</HI> their <HI>Innocent</HI> and <HI>near Related</HI> Neigh|bour; And who would hazard their Soul upon such odds? Thirdly, If they did indeed doubt of it <HI>before</HI> the Birth, they ought (as was said) to have <HI>sent</HI> some trusty Persons, or have signified their desire, that some <HI>here,</HI> whom they could confide in, should be <HI>present.</HI> If they only doubted of it after the Prince was Born, they might have demanded that the same Persons might have <HI>Counter-interrogated,</HI> and <HI>Examin'd</HI> the Witnesses; now they were bound in Conscience to use all such honest and wary Means before they proceded thus to the <HI>highest Extremities.</HI> Fourthly, If <HI>greatest Proof</HI> against <HI>no Proof</HI> could not satisfie them, Why did they not, to clear their Honour that they had not acted Unjustly, Undutifully, or Unchristianly since the time they came hither, bring the Matter into a <HI>new</HI> Examination? Since nothing
<PB N="29" REF="15">
could <HI>more</HI> contribute to <HI>settle</HI> them in the Throne, had it been prov'd an Imposture, nor have more <HI>ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iged</HI> all <HI>England</HI> to them, nor have more <HI>taken off</HI> the <HI>Scandal</HI> of the World, and have satisfied <HI>every</HI> Man of the <HI>Iustice</HI> of their Proceedings. Lastly, If it had been done for the good of <HI>Europe,</HI> and to bring the <HI>French King</HI> lower, (though this could not justifie this Invasion,) yet Why was not at least the wisest Course taken for this? Had the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> pursued only the Ends express'd in his Declaration, and obliged King <HI>Iames,</HI> as he might easily have done, to <HI>redress Abuses here,</HI> and make a lasting League with the Confederates abroad; it had, in all likelihood, by this time reduced the <HI>French King</HI> to a low Condition: For then King <HI>Iames</HI> had been able to unite all the Force of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and bend them unanimously against the Common Enemy: Whereas now our Men (and Money too) are employ'd in Fighting against one another in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; nor only so, but <HI>England</HI> it self, whose <HI>free Consent</HI> he so much brags of, is so Distracted, that we know not how soon we may fall into the same Misfortunes; <HI>some</HI> out of Conscience, not daring to hazard their <HI>Souls</HI> in Swearing Allegiance to one, whose Title the most zealous Adherers to him cannot agree on, nor them|selves are <HI>satisfied</HI> with; and far more of them being <HI>disgusted</HI> to see our Countrey <HI>beggared</HI> to maintain the Quarrel of <HI>Foreigners,</HI> and <HI>en|rich</HI> our <HI>greatest Enemies the Dutch</HI>; so that this Pretence of pulling down the Heighth of <HI>France,</HI> though I doubt not, but it was the In|tention of the Confederates, was far from being the main Design of the <HI>Prince of Orange.</HI> He could then have no other Motive of Inva|ding <HI>England,</HI> Driving out his <HI>Father,</HI> and Usurping his <HI>Throne,</HI> but mere <HI>Ambition,</HI> seconded by Dutch Policy, making use of our <HI>Rebel|liousness,</HI> silly <HI>Credulity,</HI> and our addictedness to <HI>Lying,</HI> that they might <HI>cheat</HI> us of our <HI>Money,</HI> make us defend <HI>their</HI> Quarrel, and <HI>impoverish</HI> us to that degree, that we should not <HI>dare</HI> to resent it, when they get our <HI>Trade,</HI> and <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zen</HI> us of our Plantations, (as they have done often,) and then (to crown the <HI>Dutch</HI> Jest) laugh at us for a Company of <HI>dull|headed block headedly Fools</HI> when they have done.</P>
<P>But I must not forget the Instances he brings to prove this Inva|sion to be <HI>agreeable</HI> to the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Doctrine, and vouch'd by the Law of <HI>Nations</HI>; and those are these Three.</P>
<P>First he Instances in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> giving Assistance to the <HI>Dutch</HI> against the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> (p. 16.) Now this hath been so well an|swered already, in the <HI>Defence of the Bishop of</HI> Chichester's <HI>Dying De|claration,</HI> that I do not see any Reason to concern my self with it; and, methinks, this <HI>Answerer</HI> should have first answered what had been al|ledged there, before he ventured on this Instance; but some Men have a peculiar Confidence to bring in Things over and over, though they have been answered sufficiently, and yet never take notice of the An|swers. However, it is sufficient here to observe, that this is nothing at all to his purpose; he tells us but four lines before, That what <HI>he is to make out, is that the then</HI> P. <HI>of</HI> O <HI>by his Relation to the Crown, had a just Right to concern himself in the Vindication of our Religion and Liberties, and that this is not repugnant to the Doctrines of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>p.</HI> 15. And,
<PB N="30" REF="16">
I pray, good Sir, Had Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> any <HI>Relation</HI> to the Govern|ment of the <HI>Low Countries</HI>? And if not, how does this Instance prove that which he is to <HI>make out,</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> by vir|tue of his <HI>Relation</HI> to the Crown, had a just Right to concern himself; and his Instance proves that any Prince, whether they have any <HI>such Relation</HI> or not, have a just Right to concern themselves. And what, I pray, is all this to a Title by Conquest? Let it be admitted, but not granted, and which I suppose will not be easily proved, that no Foreign Prince hath a just Right to make War upon another Prince, for In|vading the Liberty, and Religion of his own Subjects; hath he there|fore a just Right to make a Conquest of these People, whose Liber|ties he pretends to defend, and to set himself King over them? Or had Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> upon pretence of securing the <HI>Dutch</HI> Liberties, a just Right to make her self Queen over them? In my Opinion it is a pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty odd way of rescuing People's Liberties, to make a Conquest of them; and if this be the Case, Princes and their Flatterers may talk of Piety and a Care of the People, but all the World will see that the Design is not <HI>Religion</HI> nor <HI>Liberty</HI> to the People, but a <HI>Crown</HI> to them|selves; and it cannot chuse but be very <HI>Pious</HI> and <HI>Religious</HI> to gain a Crown.</P>
<P>His next Instance is in King <HI>Iames</HI>'s time, When the <HI>Prince Elector was chosen King of</HI> Bohemia. And how does this prove his Point? Why, <HI>he sent to King</HI> James <HI>for Advice, and he had no mind he should engage in it.</HI> And therefore the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hath a just Right to concern himself, and to make himself King according to the Principles of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> I perceive it is not for every body to make Consequences, for who but our Authour could ever have found out how such wonderful Things followed from King <HI>Iames</HI>'s denying his Son to engage in it. Well, <HI>But the Arch bishop wrote a Letter to the Secretary, and said, that he was satisfied in his Conscience that the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bemians had a just Cause, and that the King's Daughter professed she would not leave her self one Iewel, rather than not maintain so Religious and Righteous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cause.</HI> And that may be too; but without Reflection on that Prin|cess, that is no Evidence of the Righteousness of a Cause; for some Kings Daughters will not leave themselves a Jewel, rather than not to take away, and keep a Kingdom from their Own Father, and which is neither a Religious, nor a Righteous Cause.</P>
<P>His Third Instance is in the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, <HI>When the King of</HI> Denmark <HI>had taken Arms to settle the Peace, and Liberty of the Germans, and was Defeated; and King</HI> Charles <HI>thought himself concerned to assist him; and Arch-bishop</HI> Laud <HI>drew up a Declaration setting forth the Danger, and requiring the People's Prayers and Assistance to prevent the growth of</HI> Spain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now it does not appear whether th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s pretence of taking Arms was just, or unjust, (for our Authour has a peculiar faculty of talking of Things at random, and never stating them, and bringing them down to the matter in Dispute.) But let that be as it will, it makes no difference in the present Dispute; for let the Cause of his taking Arms be originally what it will, I hope King <HI>Charles</HI> might assist him to prevent his being over-run, there|by securing the Peace and Safety of his own Kingdom. And this
<PB N="31" REF="16">
was plainly the Case: The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> had made War upon the Empire, and was defeated; and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t without Assi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ence, the Emperour might have wholly subdued him, which would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e|ly have ruined <HI>Denmark,</HI> but have endangered all the Northern Princes, and especially <HI>England,</HI> as the <HI>Declaration</HI> it self speaks, <HI>there will be an open way for</HI> Spain <HI>left, to do what they pleased.</HI> And what is this to our Authour's purpose? Is there no difference between Assisting one Prince actually at War with another, to prevent his utter Overthrow and De|struction, and in such a case for wise and politick Ends to stop the ex|orbitant and dangerous Growth of a potent Neighbour; and for the same Prince to take away another Prince's Crown, because he is unea|sie and ungratefull to his Subjects? Yet after such fallacious Inferences, our Author with his wonted Modesty adds, <HI>Let those who now with as much Ignorance as Confidence upbraid Men with Renouncing the Doctrines and Principles of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>read and consider these Passages, and if any thing will make them more wise and humble, this will.</HI></P>
<P>He contends all along to prove from those Instances, which are of several <HI>Independent Governours,</HI> and so relate to the <HI>Law of Nations,</HI> that this Proceeding of the Prince of <HI>Orange is not repugnant to the Doctrines and Principles of the Church of</HI> England, p. 15. and more particularly afterwards from the <HI>Homilies,</HI> p. 21, 22. which say, <HI>we are bound to obey a Heathen Tyrant,</HI> and to <HI>pray</HI> for him; from the Jews who were <HI>com|mended to pray for the King of</HI> Babylon, and for <HI>obeying</HI> Augustus; last|ly, from <HI>our Saviour's acknowledging the Roman President's Power and Au|thority, as given him from God.</HI> Nay, he argues <HI>a fortiori,</HI> p. 21. from the <HI>Homilies,</HI> thus: <HI>If they</HI> (and consequently the Church of <HI>England</HI>) <HI>declare we are bound by God's Word to obey a Heathen Tyrant,</HI> much more ought we, <HI>by the Doctrines and Principles of our Church, to pay Allegiance to good and religious Princes,</HI> &amp;c. This is the full force of his Argument why we <HI>ought</HI> to pay Allegiance to the present Governours. But first, We cannot think th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m <HI>good</HI> and <HI>religious,</HI> whilst we see they have <HI>wil|fully broken,</HI> and obstinately <HI>continue</HI> to <HI>break God's holy Commandments,</HI> the <HI>Observing</HI> of which is the best <HI>Test</HI> of <HI>Goodness</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI> Next he le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves the main Point, which Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI> mentions out of his <HI>Convo|cations</HI> that are better Declarers of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Doctrine than the <HI>Homilies,</HI>) That the Authority of all those Conquerours was to be <HI>thoroughly settled</HI>; so that there was no mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l. Possibility the for|mer Governour (in case he had been alive) could ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r by himself, or his Friends, be <HI>restored</HI>; and therefore we seldom or never hear that any of such <HI>ejected</HI> or <HI>subdued</HI> Sovereigns did <HI>ever</HI> struggle for their King|doms, or went about to recover them. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w this suits with our pre|se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se, where the former supreme Governour is <HI>living,</HI> did <HI>ever,</HI> and does still <HI>claim it, pursues</HI> the Recovery of it, has a most potent Mo|narch abroad for his Friend, who espouses his Quarrel has engaged his Honour <HI>he will either restore him to his Crown, or lose his own,</HI> is ea|sie to be discerned. But moreover, which is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ess material in this Business, King <HI>Iames</HI> has great Parties in <HI>each</HI> of the three Nations, who do not acknowledge th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> present Governours&punc; and look upon them as <HI>unjust Vsurpers</HI> of their Father's <HI>Right.</HI> Besides, (which alters the Case extremely,) here was no <HI>Conquest,</HI> or <HI>subduing</HI> England <HI>by Force</HI>; nay,
<PB N="32" REF="17">
no <HI>War</HI> at all exercised upon it: His bad Cause forces this mercenary Writer to shuffle to and fro, and pretend now <HI>one</HI> Thing, now <HI>another</HI>; but <HI>all</HI> of them, when they come to be <HI>scann'd</HI> and <HI>applied,</HI> equally to no purpose. <HI>Conquest</HI> he dares not call it in <HI>down right Terms,</HI> for fear of disgusting all <HI>England,</HI> by making us all <HI>Slaves</HI>; yet those Instances of <HI>Rightfall Power</HI> which he brings, and would have us think to be <HI>pa|rallel</HI> to this New Government, and <HI>proper</HI> to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et it, were all true <HI>Suc|cesses</HI> in <HI>War,</HI> and by consequence perfect <HI>Conquests.</HI> 'Tis easie to dis|cern by these <HI>Hints</HI> what he would be at, and not hard to conjecture what Title, though they have agreed of none hitherto, they intend at length to pitch upon finally, unless the Patriots of the Subjects <HI>Liberty</HI> do in time restrain such audacious Attempts.</P>
<P>Thus far in Answer to his settling King <HI>William</HI>'s Title, which being shown to be incoherent and ill grounded, in every Regard, it follows, that Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI> suffered for a <HI>Righteous Cause,</HI> and for his <HI>due Allegiance</HI> to his <HI>true Sovereign,</HI> which entitles him to the Honour of a <HI>glorious Martyr,</HI> and this in case he had endeavoured to make way for his Ma|ster's Restauration. It remains to vindicate his Paper from those other <HI>petty</HI> Exceptions this G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntleman makes against it.</P>
<P>He denies p. 24. that King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Usage, after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Arrival, was very hard, severe, and unjust. Let the World judge. A Council was held at <HI>Windsor,</HI> upon Notice of the King's being in hold at <HI>Feversham,</HI> where it was debated, whether or no he should be sent to the Tower&punc; And 'tis well known who they were that voted in the Affirmative. But the Prince having laid his Design, feared that if the King staid here, some Accommodation would be made; so he sent Monsieur <HI>Zuylisten</HI> to tell him, he would have him to stay at <HI>Ro|chester,</HI> which being a Port Town, and towards the Sea, might afford him opportunity to escape out of <HI>England.</HI> The Message mist him; so he returned to <HI>White-hall.</HI> The next Night the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> sent three Lords to him at Midnight, to tell him he would have him re|move by Ten the next Morning to <HI>Ham,</HI> a place very unlikely to be approved of, there being (as the King objected) neither Furniture nor Provisions for him; and therefore as he expected he moved, for his Return to <HI>Rochester,</HI> which after his sitting an hour in his Barge, wai|ting his Pleasure, was granted: And thither he was pack'd away in great State with <HI>Dutch Myrmidons</HI>; now (to the eternal Shame of En|glish Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">jects) their King's Gaolers, under whom he suffered Hardship enough; but he was not allowed out of his own Exchequer one Far|thing to bear his Charges. The King had before this sent him a Message by the Earl of <HI>Feversham,</HI> offering to settle all things in Parliament to His and the Kingdom's Satisfaction: Now had the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> meant <HI>sincerely</HI> in what he <HI>pretended,</HI> and come onely for the <HI>Good</HI> of the Nation, what could he have wished more? But what would have <HI>obliged</HI> and <HI>sweetened</HI> another, did highly <HI>exasperate</HI> him; for he re|lish'd this Condescendence of his <HI>so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll,</HI> being indeed unsuitable to the ambitious Aim he proposed to himself, that, first, <HI>contrary to the Law of Nations,</HI> he made his Ambassadour Prisoner, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n sent his Wor|shipfull Command at Midnight to his Father, to be gone out of his own Palace to a Prison; for they told him a Guard was appointed for

him at <HI>Ham-house,</HI> whither the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> ordered him to go the next Morning; enough to let the King see what he was to expect. He tells the Prince of <HI>Orange could have prevented his going away</HI>; true: But then he feared the Nation would only <HI>reduce King Iames,</HI> not <HI>de|pose him,</HI> much less <HI>chuse another,</HI> their own King being <HI>present</HI>; it was therefore thought more Politick to <HI>fright</HI> him <HI>away,</HI> and then pretend <HI>Abdication,</HI> and the Necessity of a <HI>new</HI> Government, which he knew well (as he and his <HI>Faction</HI> would handle it) could light on none but <HI>himself</HI>: So that it was out of kindness to <HI>himself,</HI> not to King <HI>Iames,</HI> or the <HI>Nation,</HI> that he let him escape. Yet he Magnifies this Indulgence of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> exceedingly; but I would ask him, in what this Civility differs from that of <HI>Robbers,</HI> who first strip the poor Travellers of all they have, and then turn them a Grazing without a Penny in their Purse, or as this pretty Gentleman phrases it, (<HI>p.</HI> 24.) <HI>Allow them great Freedom to go where they please.</HI> I would ask him too what <HI>one</HI> Thing was done by the Prince, which look'd either <HI>Generous, Civil,</HI> or in the <HI>least degree Respectful</HI> towards a <HI>King</HI> and a <HI>Father,</HI> and not ra|ther most <HI>Barbarous</HI> and <HI>Rude</HI>?

Has not the <HI>dri|ving out King Iames,</HI> and the <HI>Protecting</HI> our new Governor (and his only) put us upon such an expensive War, that we are upon our last Legs; it being absolutely impossible to squeeze Five Millions more out of our drain'd Purses to keep the War on foot another Year, which is the least Summ that can now be expected: For if <HI>Five Millions</HI> this Year have done <HI>nothing at all,</HI> 'tis to be fear'd that <HI>Seven Millions</HI> will scarce enable us to do much the <HI>next.</HI> A certain Person employ'd in the Treasury, who has the opportunity to know exactly the Incomes and Issues of the Exchequer, assured a worthy Friend of mine, that this <HI>Michaelmas</HI> there will have been paid out of it, since this Revolution, <HI>Fifteen Millions</HI>; and that there is still an Arrear behind, to the Army, to the Navy, and for Stores, of <HI>Five Millions</HI> more: And this besides many Thousands (perhaps a Hundred of Thousands) owing for the Wages of transport Ships; and that for want of ready Money the Cre|ditors are paid with <HI>Tallies,</HI> so that those who have them can raise no Money, without abating Four or Five Shillings in the Pound, until the next Parliament gives Money to pay off all these Back-reckonings.

Work of Conquering <HI>France</HI> go but slowly on: Every wise Man, even of our State-Party, clearly seeing, and with regret complaining, that in all appearance the War is as far from an End, as it was at the Be|ginning.</P>
<P>Now where is all this Money to be had, or whence to be raised? Are not our Ships taken in great Multitudes, our Traffick decay'd abroad, our Trade at home, the Tenants unable to pay their Landlords; so that sometimes instead of bringing in their Rents, they are forc'd to send to them for Money to pay their Taxes, or else they must throw up their Farms? Are not they already forced, in many Places for want of Money, to exchange one Commodity for another in the Mar|kets? Is not half our Cash gone out of the Nation, so that in <HI>Holland</HI> alone our <HI>Guineas</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll'd Money</HI> have been as frequent as their own Coin? Is not Clipp'd Money, which is not worth Transporting, now, in a manner, the only currant Coin left in the Nation? And to pre|vent the possibility our good Money should ever return again, it is melted down in <HI>Holland</HI> into the drossie Alloy of their <HI>Sebellings</HI> and <HI>Stuyvers.</HI> But the Transporting our <HI>Coin'd</HI> Money is not all: They have invented more Expedients than One or Two <HI>open</HI> ones to impoverish <HI>England</HI>; the <HI>Decus &amp; Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">amen,</HI> inscribed on the Edges of our new Coin, was Judg'd an eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctual Preservative from Clipping and Fyling. But now the Clippers (who by the Law are to suffer as <HI>Felows</HI>) are be|come the best Friends to the Trafficking part of the Nation; and if they be not conniv'd at, and the <HI>Melters</HI> down of our <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll'd</HI> and <HI>Vn|circumcised</HI> Money into <HI>Bullion,</HI> transported in vast quantities every Year into <HI>Holland,</HI> (as appears by the Entries in the <HI>Custom-house,</HI>) be not severely punish'd, we must in a short time be contented with onely <HI>Copper</HI> and <HI>Tin Farebings,</HI> or else be forc'd to debase our Money to the Dutch Standard. If Captain <HI>Guy</HI> and several other Masters of Yatches, and other Vessels both Dutch and English, were strictly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, they could tell them what prodigious Number of Chests of Money in <HI>Specie,</HI> or in <HI>Bullion</HI> have been transported these Three last Years into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders.</HI> We have indeed some Returns from thence, for they bring us prohibited Goods; so that both in Exporting and Importing our English Laws are still Dispensed with, without any permission from the Parliament, and no Man (though our Ruin depends upon it) <HI>dares</HI> complain. There is yet another odd Commodity imported, which would much encrease the Revenue, if it did but pay Custom; and that is Shoals of Caterpillars, that come over to devour the Fruits of our Labours, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> I mean, and other Foreigners with their <HI>Wives</HI> and Children, of which scarce a Ship or Hoy comes hither that brings not from Ten to Sixty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These and the <HI>French Hugenots</HI> are tran|sported hither to make up several new Colonies, and compose a <HI>Secret Militia,</HI> to be ready at a dead lift to enslave our Countrey, if, our Eyes being at length opened to see our impending Ruine, we grow Head|strong, and refuse to wear the Yoke which is preparing for us.</P>
<P>Again, Have we felt nothing from the Insolencies of the <HI>Dutch, Danes,</HI> and other <HI>Foreigners</HI> wherever they come. Lastly, What are all those Losses put together, in Comparison to the loss of so many English-men's <HI>Lives,</HI> who have perish'd either by War, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> through

want of Necessaries, or else by strange Diseases in <HI>Ireland</HI> and at Sea. A Thousand or Two are swept away at a clap in this late prodigious Storm: The loss of the <HI>Coronation,</HI> and the other Ships that perish'd, and the damage done to all the rest that suffered in their Rigging, and otherwise in that Hurricane, is not worth the mention by those who are so inur'd to continual losses of sundry kinds as we are; though I'm told by a knowing Person, that the Repairing of that one M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sfortune will require some Hundreds of Thousands of Pounds to be added to the former large Audit of the Nation's Accounts.

He runs from the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter to talk of the <HI>French King</HI>; but the true point, to which he ought to have spoken, is, Whether we were <HI>burden'd</HI> with any such <HI>Taxes,</HI> or felt these Miseries of <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Poverty</HI> under King <HI>Iames</HI>? Had we any concern with <HI>France,</HI> either by <HI>abetting</HI> or <HI>oppo|sing</HI> it in <HI>his</HI> Days? Had the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or our selves used the King Dutifully, as we ought, we might have secur'd our selves whilst that Prince was here against either <HI>Popery</HI> or <HI>Slavery</HI> (which we pre|tended to dread) being <HI>forc'd</HI> upon us, we might have enjoy'd <HI>Peace, Plenty, Trade,</HI> and <HI>Riches,</HI> and have reapt <HI>incomparable Benefits,</HI> and <HI>vast Advantages</HI> by the Distractions of <HI>all others</HI> round about us. This we might have done; and if we saw Cause to fear that <HI>France</HI> meant to disturb us, when we medled not with it, (which that King is too Politick to do,) we might, by joyning with other Disinterested Prin|ces, have kept the Ballance of <HI>Europe</HI> even at our pleasure, and have stipulated with <HI>Holland</HI> and the rest of the Confederates to bear the Charges of the War, whilst we stept into <HI>their</HI> Assistance; whereas now we are forc'd to hire them at a dear Rates to assist us, to keep a Man in the Throne who has <HI>no</HI> Right to it: All this we might <HI>then</HI> have done, had we been <HI>wise</HI>; but a <HI>Rebellious Spirit,</HI> which had <HI>possess'd</HI> and <HI>infatuated</HI> us, hurried us inconsiderately into a <HI>War,</HI> for no other Reason but to <HI>maintain</HI> obstinately that <HI>Sin,</HI> which we ought to have <HI>repented</HI> of.

and the State were bent against her. As for our <HI>new Principles</HI> then; let him but open his Eyes, and he may see <HI>Rebellion</HI> made now a chief point of <HI>Religion.</HI> He may see Oaths of Allegiance made to Persons, whose Title to the Government (as appears by what has been amply prov'd above) not one Man in <HI>England</HI> certainly knows, and not one <HI>knowing</HI> and <HI>disinteressed</HI> Man is satisfied in, <HI>forc'd</HI> upon Men's Con|sciences to make the Kingdom, as far as lies in their Power, a <HI>Nation of Knaves,</HI> and all those who make a good Conscience of their ways a <HI>Company of Beggars.</HI> He may see the Commandments <HI>laugh'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>; and those who dare boldly stand up for them branded and persecuted for <HI>Traitors,</HI> and put to death as the <HI>worst</HI> of Malefactors. Besides the foremention'd Miseries, there is still <HI>One</HI> that is no less Galling to Persons of Honour and Probity, who for themselves, and the <HI>Reputa|tion</HI> of the Nation, would preserve the Characters of Just and Upright, Loyal and Pious, Conscientious and <HI>keepers</HI> of their <HI>Faith</HI> to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI>; these now lie under the heavy Sentence of <HI>Violaters</HI> of all the <HI>Car|dinal Vertues,</HI> with which Character when Foreign Nations once brand a People, it sticks upon them to all succeeding Ages. In former days we were reputed Valiant, Hospitable, <HI>inviolable Observers</HI> of our <HI>Com|pacts, Faith,</HI> and <HI>Honesty.</HI></P>
<P>But we can't forget what an <HI>Odium</HI> the <HI>Murther</HI> of <HI>King Charles</HI> I. brought upon the whole <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI>; yet there was then some just Apology to be made for that Barbarity: That <HI>Tremendous</HI> Fact was not committed 'till after Six Yeas Civil War, 'wherein the Victorious Rebels had conquer'd, disarm'd, and utterly impoverish'd the Loyal Party, yet there still remain'd a numerous Part of the Three Kingdome, who made many generous Attempts to restore King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the whole Nation wearied with their endless Miseries, and the Succes|sion of Usurpers, at last happily effected it.</P>
<P>Now what shall we say for our selves, who have <HI>Abdicated</HI> our King without shedding <HI>One Ounce of Blood,</HI> or adventuring a bloody Nose in his <HI>Defence</HI>? All Nations from the <HI>Orcades</HI> to the extreamest <HI>Indies,</HI> must judge us to be a People who have no regard to the most Sacred Oaths, the most ungrateful of all Mankind, a Nation <HI>fitted for Slavery degenerating</HI> from our <HI>Loyal Ancestors,</HI> the <HI>Off-spring</HI> or <HI>By-blows</HI> of <HI>Prostigate Rebels.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, we are still so much worse than those of the last Age, in that now so numerous a Party of the very Clergy, who <HI>should,</HI> and <HI>do know</HI> the Oligation of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, which every single Man of them took to their <HI>lawful King,</HI> have by <HI>unpardonable Perjury</HI> renounc'd their King, and sworn Allegiance to One whom they know in their Consciences, and have often declar'd upon Occasion hath no <HI>legal Right</HI>; no, not so much as <HI>Cromewell the Wicked:</HI> These are the Men who have brought an <HI>indelible Scandal</HI> and <HI>Hatred</HI> upon our Religion. <HI>Miratur Orbis se tam cito factum esse Arrianum,</HI> was the pathetical Exclamation of a holy Authour of Old: What would he have said, if he had liv'd in our Age, to see a National Clergy <HI>Aposta|tise</HI> from the Establish'd Doctrine of their own Church, in the point of Allegiance and Non-resistance? By the Conduct of these Men, one would be almost tempted to look upon all Religion as a mere <HI>Cheat,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="19">
and to believe that they themselves <HI>own'd</HI> no God. Whether they do or not, I shall not give my self the trouble to enquire; but I am sure some of them do as good as own no <HI>Hell,</HI> by <HI>Teaching</HI> Men, that notwith|standing those <HI>terrible Threatnings</HI> God in his holy Word has denounc'd against the Incorrigible and Impenitent, of <HI>everlasting Fire, everlasting Punishment,</HI> &amp;c, he has not obliged himself to the literal Performance of them, since <HI>he that threatens keeps the Right of punishing in his own hand, and is not obliged to execute what he hath threatned, any farther than the Reasons and Ends of Government do require,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Of what comfortable Importance this Doctrine may be to <HI>some,</HI> and how necessary under our present Circumstances, let any one judge: 'Tis impossible Men should have perpetrated such abominable Villanies as have been lately transacted, to the Amazement of all that have the least Sense of Piety or Honour left, unless their Minds had been first de|bauched with these or the like Principles. He that will audaciously violate the sacred Commands of God, acknowledged such by the Church of <HI>England, his own Subscriptions, Oaths,</HI> and <HI>Preaching,</HI> must necessarily fansie some secret Reserves of Mercy in the Breast of the Al|mighty for the Authors and Abetters of such horrid Crimes, upon <HI>some Occasions,</HI> which will not suffer his Justice to pass upon them in ano|ther World, or some extraordinary <HI>Relaxations</HI> or <HI>Mitigations</HI> of fu|ture Torments. The first seems to be despaired of, because there is small Hopes of Repentance left, the Scriptures for that very Reason, perhaps, amongst many others, comparing <HI>Rebellion</HI> to the Sin of Witchcraft; the latter therefore is pitch'd upon as most congruous to carnal-minded Men, who to enjoy the <HI>Pleasures of Sin</HI> for a Season, and not willing to go to Heaven through Tribulations and Afflictions, do rather <HI>chuse</HI> to undergo a future Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ishment, especially if it consists onely as to its Perpetuity in a bare <HI>Exclusion</HI> from Eternal Happiness. <HI>Serm.</HI> p. 15.</P>
<P>Now, I say, such a Series of Villany as has been hitherto, and shall be farther exposed, being altogether inconsistent with the Principles of Christianity, which this accursed Generation of Monsters had not long since most zealously professed, they found it as necessary to <HI>Abdi|cate</HI> their <HI>Saviour</HI> and his <HI>Precepts,</HI> as well as their <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Rights,</HI> as far as they durst. The first thing they did was to ridicule and bla|sphemously expose the <HI>Doctrine of the Cross,</HI> and if they could have drawn over the Majority of the <HI>Convocation</HI> to their Party, the next thing they design'd was to have expunged out of the <HI>Liturgie</HI> the <HI>Atha|nasian Creed,</HI> which was in effect to have denied the <HI>Divinity of our Saviour,</HI> le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t they, should have been charged with <HI>Rebellion</HI> against <HI>God,</HI> as well as their <HI>King,</HI> if all Power be derived from the second Person of the Trinity as <HI>Mediator,</HI> and all lawful Kings, whether <HI>Christians, Heathens,</HI> or <HI>Mahometans,</HI> be his Vicegerents, and <HI>he hath the Disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sal of their Crowns, and the Command of their Power, and doth actually em|ploy, and makes use of it in the Prosecution of the righteous Ends of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is Go|vernment,</HI>

<P>As it appeared necessary to <HI>reform</HI> the Doctrines of Christianity, to make them square the better with their late Practice; so likewise to procure an Alteration amongst our Ecclesiastical Governours too, it being as much for the Interest of this upstart Government the <HI>Metro|politan</HI> should be an <HI>Vsurper,</HI> as the supreme Governour in the Civil State; <HI>Like Bishop like King,</HI> being as true a Maxim now, a <HI>No Bishop no King</HI> heretofore. If the <HI>Metropolitical</HI> See had been real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y void, this present nominal Archbishop was unqualified for it, being esteem'd an <HI>Heretick,</HI> and by the 84th Canon of the Apostles, as being an actual <HI>Rebel,</HI> who ought to be <HI>deposed,</HI> or <HI>degraded</HI> from his <HI>Priesthood</HI> and though in the present juncture he cannot be convicted and sentenced; yet his <HI>Crimes</HI> being so <HI>notorious,</HI> all that understand them ought not in Con|science to own him as a Christian Bishop, or hold Communion with him, according to the 33d Canon of the <HI>Laodicean Council,</HI> that we ought not to pray, or communicate with <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> or <HI>Hereticks.</HI></P>
<P>Of what grand Concern these particulars are let every good Christi|an seriously consider, and lay to heart. Now it is that <HI>Poison is poured out into our Church</HI>; therefore it's high time for us to avoid the Con|tagion, according to that excellent Advice of St. <HI>Cyprian, Keep at a Distance from the Infection of such Men by fleeing from them</HI>; and shun their <HI>Conversation as you would the Cancer or Plague, according to the Premonition of our Lord,</HI> Mat. 15.14. <HI>They be blind Leaders of the blind, and if the blind lead the blind,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash; <HI>Let them perish by themselves who are willing to perish, let them alone remain without the Church, who have forsaken the Church.</HI> Epist. 40. <HI>ad Plebem, &amp;c.</HI> How can these Men pretend to be Guides to others, who keep to no certain Path themselves? What certainty can there be in their Doctrines, when they vary th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m with their Interest, and ever calculate them to serve a turn? Therefore none ought to communicate with them, who value the Sal|vation of their Souls, and are not willing to partake of their Guilt and Punishment.</P>
<P>The Doctrines and Duties of our holy Religion have the Spirit of Truth and Holiness for their Author, and like him are always the same, without any <HI>shadow of Change</HI>: But from what Spirit must these bold Attempts upon Common Christianity proceed? <HI>Holloixius</HI> in his De|fence of <HI>Origen, lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 6. cites several Passages out of his Writings, wherein he assigns a different evil Spirit to every Vice or Sin, which he calls <HI>inimicas, &amp; adversarias Virtutes,</HI> and delivers this Notion among the rest: <HI>There seems to me,</HI> says he, <HI>to be an infinite number of contra|ry Powers, or Spirits; because in almost every Man there are certain Spi|rits, which incite and provoke him to the Commission of divers Sins:</HI> E.g. <HI>There is a Spirit of Fornication, and a Spirit of Anger, a Spirit of Ava|rice, and a Spirit of Pride; and if it happens that any Man be acted by all these, or more Sins, he is to be look'd upon as possessed by so many or more Enemies, or evil Spirits.</HI> Surely then, according to this Opinion of <HI>Ori|gen.</HI> Legion must have taken Possession in some of the Grandees of this new schisinatical Church of <HI>England.</HI> How obvious is it for any but those who are infatuated, and spiritually blind, to discern the Spirit

of <HI>Rebellion, Ambition,</HI> and <HI>Emulation</HI>; the Spirit of <HI>Heresie, Schism,</HI> and <HI>Persecution</HI>; the Spirit of <HI>Blasphemy, Lying, Slandering,</HI> and <HI>Apo|stacy,</HI> reigning and triumphing among them.</P>
<P>This word <HI>Apostacy</HI> I am very sensible will found very harsh in their Ears; but let any sober and unprejudiced Person seriously consult the several Acceptations of the Word among sacred and prophane Authors, and he will soon be convinced, that it will be no easie Task for these Gentlemen to purge themselves from the imputation of it. <HI>Grotius,</HI> in his Appendix to his Commentaries <HI>de Antichristo,</HI> tell us, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t by <HI>Apo|stacy</HI> is understood all kinds of Hostility or Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umacy against a Supe|riour, who has the Right of Commanding, and proves it from several Texts of Scripture.

If the Abrenunciation, and the solemn Stipulation to keep God's holy Will and Commandments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before <HI>Baptism</HI> were the real Tests of the Faith and Sincerity of the Candidate, by which he was obliged to <HI>deny himself,</HI> and to <HI>take up his Cross; i.e.</HI> to forsake <HI>Fa|ther and Mother, Wife and Children, Lands and Possessions, and to lay down even his very Life,</HI> when ever they should come in competition with his Duty; and <HI>we</HI> cannot ordinarily be called to the Performance of this our <HI>Vow</HI> and <HI>Covenant,</HI> but under unrighteous and persecuting Princes, then it follows clearly, that by our entring into Christianity we have tied up our hands (by our own solemn Act) from making any forcible Resistence against our supreme Governours, upon any pretence whatsoever, and that the <HI>Doctrine of the Cross,</HI> or <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> is a fundamental Doctrine, or Principle of the Christian Religion; and, lastly, that whosoever <HI>teach</HI> or <HI>practice</HI> otherwise, are <HI>Renegadoes</HI> and <HI>Apostates</HI> from Christianity it self. This was very near the Assertion of Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> himself, in his Sermon on <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. v. 5. p. 36.
<Q>But, blessed be God, our Church hates and condemns this Doctrine, (<HI>viz.</HI> of deposing and resisting of Kings,) from what hand soever it come, and hath established the Rights and Authority of Princes on sure and unalterable Foundations, enjoining an entire Obedience to all the law|ful Commands of Authority, and an absolute Submission to that su|preme Power which God hath put in our Sovereigns Hands. This Doctrine we justly glory in, and if any that had their Education in our Church, have turned <HI>Renegadoes</HI> from this, they proved no less Enemies to the Church her self, than to the Civil Authority; so that their Apostacy leaves no blame on our Church.</Q></P>
<P>If this be the Case (as we have all the Reason in the World to think so) it's plain and evident to any ordinary Understanding, That these
<PB N="40" REF="21">
Men are not true Church of <HI>England</HI> Divines, as they would have all the World believe; neither is the Church in Possession any more to be esteemed the True, Legal, Ancient Church of <HI>England,</HI> than the <HI>Do|natists</HI> of Old were to be accounted the only <HI>Catholick Church.</HI> Their Priesthood is now become <HI>Schismatical,</HI> having erected <HI>Altar</HI> against <HI>Altar</HI>; their Liturgy <HI>Blasphemous</HI> and <HI>Diabolical,</HI> wherein they address themselves to God as the Author and Fountain of all unjust Power, the Patron of Injustice, and the grand Protector, and Encourager of the Notorious Violators of his most sacred Laws. What is this, but with the most impudent and horrid Blasphemy that ever was heard of, to beseech the Almighty to divest himself of his most glorious Attributes, and to enter into a League with Hell it self, for the support and main|tenance of all their detestable Impieties.</P>
<P>What have they now to say? Confusion and Shame must cover them, who are the <HI>Scandal</HI> and <HI>Reproach</HI> of the Pure and Undefiled Religion they should profess. Thousands of these could not say (though in reality the well known pretence of most) that they swore for Bread; God forgive them they durst not trust Providence, wanted the Courage to give a good Example, or to teach their Flocks the danger of Perjury: They sinned against <HI>God,</HI> and his <HI>Anointed,</HI> and their own Souls, and <HI>knew they did</HI> so.</P>
<P>In the preceeding Age we can scarce name a Dignifi'd Clergy-man, or any Person Eminent for Piety and Learning, in either of the Universi|ties, in City or Country, who were not outed their Benefices for refusing to take the Covenant or Engagement; but now the great Body of the Clergy have been observed to renounce their Allegiance, and worship the <HI>Idol</HI> of the <HI>Hogans</HI>: Indeed out of this Number we must except the <HI>Most Reverend</HI> the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> and Seven of his <HI>Right Reverend</HI> Brethren, and the other Clergy and Loyal Fellows in the Universities, who have not defiled themselves with the Abominations of their <HI>Apo|state</HI> Brethren, whose Virtue and Piety is the only Thing left to attone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for these loud and crying Sins of our Clergy; and, who incessantly like <HI>Abraham</HI> intercede with Almighty God to avert his Judgments from this sinful Nation, and which the <HI>Perjury</HI> and <HI>Apostacy,</HI> and the ge|neral Defection gives but too sad an occasion to fear hangs over our Heads.</P>
<P>In short, whatever hopes we may conceive of ever seeing the true Church of <HI>England</HI> flourish in its true Lustre and Purity, we must owe it (next to the infinite Mercy of God) to those never enough applauded <HI>Heroes</HI> of our Church, the true Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and those ejected Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who have stood in the <HI>Gap</HI> of Schism, and <HI>bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> up</HI> Loyally against the <HI>all over-bearing</HI> Torrent of the prevaricating Party, who have preferred the Peace and Comfort of a <HI>good Conscience,</HI> be|fore all wordly Honour and Interest, and fear'd the offending their good God more than their own certain Ruine from <HI>ill natured</HI> Men. How will these glorious Lights of our Church, and true Servants of the living God shine after their Tryal is over past, when the Adorer's of Mammon (those <HI>interloping</HI> Arch bishops, Bishops, and those other mean spiritted Worldlings, who preferred their <HI>Profit</HI> before their <HI>Ho|nesty</HI>) shrink, look <HI>dim</HI> and <HI>pale</HI> with Guilt; and at length their Can|dlesticks
<PB N="41" REF="21">
being removed from them, come to be utterly extinguish'd and go out like an <HI>ill scenting Snuff.</HI></P>
<P>Some Instances he brings (<HI>p.</HI> 26.) to shew we are not <HI>singular</HI> in Perjury and Rebellion. He tells us that the Law of the <HI>Land</HI> and of <HI>Nations,</HI> require us to swear Allegiance to him who is in Possession: Which lame Pretence is answered fully over and over, in the forenamed Books against Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI>; only this Gentleman's Assertion is more raw than his, for <HI>he</HI> proceeds upon <HI>quiet Possession</HI> (as do also our Lawyers, whom he speaks of, and would have quoted if he durst.) But this Man makes account that <HI>bare Possession,</HI> however qualified, gives Title to our Allegiance, nay <HI>obliges</HI> us to <HI>swear</HI> it too, which we cannot do unless we can safely swear, that this Discourse of his is Con|victive; which, <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le be sworn,</HI> is most pernicious Nonsense, and would, if followed, pervert all the settled Order of Mankind, and all Right in the World. To assert that mere <HI>Possession</HI> of a Thing gives a Man Right to it, is enough to encourage all Men to be <HI>Rebels, Vsurpers, Rob|bers, Thieves,</HI> and <HI>Cheats.</HI> It cries aloud to them all, <HI>Catch that catch may, my Masters; all that you get is your own, by the Law of the Land, and of Nations, of once you get but Possession.</HI> It makes the saying of the Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eves [<HI>This is mine, I stole it</HI>] very strong Reason and good Sense. He'll say these Cases are not parallel to his: But why are they not, if a true Prince has as <HI>good Right</HI> to his Crown, as a Subject has to his <HI>Money</HI> or his <HI>Goods</HI>? For if he has, then a Possession <HI>transfers</HI> the Right of a <HI>Crown</HI>; so it must transfer the Right of a <HI>Purse,</HI> a <HI>Cloak,</HI> &amp;c. And with so much the more Reason as the Right of the Crown (on which the common Good of the Nation depends.) ought to be more <HI>fixt</HI> and <HI>unalienable,</HI> than the Right of private Men to their Goods, which are of an <HI>inferior</HI> Concern. Now if the Law of the Land require us to swear Allegiance as due to any present Possessor, the same Law de|clares that Allegiance, and consequently the Crown is his <HI>Right</HI>; other|wise the Law would oblige me to swear false. And if the <HI>Law of the Land</HI> declares the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> has <HI>Right</HI>; To what end did this Gentleman all this while run about to the <HI>Law of Nations</HI> to patch him up a Title? It must be a pitiful Cause that makes a Man, who other|wise has wit enough, still interfere thus with himself.</P>
<P>But he says, That if <HI>an Oath of Allegiance should not follow Possession, there would be infinite Snares to the Consciences of all such who are requir'd to obey, but are not bound to enquire into the Right of War.</HI> Note, by the way, one of those shuffling Tricks, of which his Book is full. He begins with <HI>Oaths,</HI> but proceeds as if only <HI>Obedience</HI> were required: As if a Man could not live quietly under a Government, without <HI>Swear|ing</HI> and calling God to witness that the Governor has <HI>Right</HI> to the King|dom, (and consequently to our Allegiance,) whether we know he has or no. But let us apply our selves to his Discourse. All the play of these Men, is to persuade the World that this business of Allegiance due to <HI>King Iames</HI> only, is a Kind of <HI>dubious Case</HI>; and then if they can but get their Judgment to <HI>bover,</HI> they hope that Interest or Fear <HI>may turn the Ballance,</HI> and make them swear to <HI>King William:</HI> Whereas we maintain that 'tis a <HI>most plain</HI> Case, which none but <HI>byass'd</HI> Men can <HI>doubt</HI> of. Is it not evident to all, that King <HI>Iames</HI> was Three Years
<PB N="42" REF="22">
agoe the undoubted Supreme Governor, and that all the World held that none but he had <HI>Right</HI> to the Crown, and consequently that Al|legiance would then be <HI>lawfully</HI> sworn to <HI>none but him</HI>? Is it not evi|dent that he is <HI>living,</HI> and has not <HI>given up</HI> his Right; and so, by the common course of the World, 'tis evidently <HI>his still</HI>? Is it not evident even to themselves that the new Right of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is ob|scure, that Men are in several Minds about the <HI>Ground</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> of it; some alledging <HI>one</HI> Thing, others <HI>another,</HI> which shews that <HI>England</HI> it self is <HI>not satisfied</HI> with the <HI>Truth</HI> of his Title, but is led on by <HI>Fear</HI> or <HI>Interest</HI>? Is it not evident that very many conscientious and good Men, amongst whom are the Primate, and some Bishops, and many reverend and worthy Pastors of our Church do refuse to take the New Oath; whose Authority far <HI>outweighs all</HI> the others, in regard they have no Motive but <HI>pure Conscience,</HI> since they are <HI>ruin'd</HI> for <HI>refusing</HI>; whereas the <HI>Complying</HI> Party find <HI>Interest,</HI> and the <HI>Favour</HI> of great Men, by their mercenary Submission? Is it not manifestly evident to every sincere Christian's Conscience, even of the most ordinary Capacity, that Oaths are <HI>most Sacred</HI> Things; and that those Oaths which were due, or have been <HI>sworn</HI> upon <HI>certain</HI> Grounds to an <HI>undoubted</HI> and <HI>indisputable</HI> Au|thority, ought not to be <HI>unsworn</HI> again, by swearing Allegiance upon <HI>uncertain</HI> Grounds to a <HI>dubious</HI> (at least) and <HI>disputable</HI> Authority? So that here is no <HI>moot Case</HI> in the Business, as he would pretend, but <HI>plain Sense,</HI> which <HI>every</HI> sincere and conscientious Christian is capable of comprehending: There is no danger then of <HI>infinite Snares,</HI> (as he madly calls them,) not of <HI>any</HI> at all, but those of <HI>weak Fears,</HI> or <HI>base Interest,</HI> which have already <HI>ensnared</HI> many Consciences, and are spread every where, as the <HI>Devil's Nets</HI> to <HI>entangle</HI> and <HI>ensnare</HI> the unwary, unstable, and worldly minded Men.</P>
<P>He asks, <HI>p.</HI> 26. If it be Perjury and Rebellion in the now <HI>French King's Conquests, for the Inhabitants to take Oaths of Fidelity to the French King</HI>? Now this is a very pleasant Gentleman; and for all his objecting, p. 19. <HI>The admiring the French Conduct to this sort of Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> [Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI>'s Friends.] He hath said more for the <HI>French King</HI> than any <HI>Iacobite</HI> in <HI>England</HI> will say, and the rankest <HI>French Man</HI> in the World can say no more; and that is, that he hath a Right to all the Places he has over-run with his Arms, in <HI>Flanders, Savoy,</HI> yea, and the Principality of <HI>Orange</HI> too. But then, Where is that independant So|vereignty which our Author talks of, as necessary and essential to make a Title by Conquest? For he is possess'd of the Principality of <HI>Orange</HI>; and therefore according to our Author, the King of <HI>France</HI> is Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and no body else. And not to meddle with what Right Conquest conveys, (as being foreign to the present Question;) here is this vast difference in the two Cases: The King of <HI>France</HI> ac|tually Conquered these Places and People; the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> did not Conquer <HI>England,</HI> and none but a Mad-man will say he did: And therefore if the Author would have made the Case parallel, he should thus have put his Question, Whether it would not have been Perjury for the Inhabitants of those Places, to have put the Government into the <HI>French King's</HI> Hands, to transfer their Allegiance, and to take an Oath of Fidelity to him, when it was in their Power to resist; nay,
<PB N="43" REF="22">
when he could not do it otherwise but by themselves, and by their own Contrivance, and Assistance: In that Case, which is plainly ours, I stick not to affirm that it is Perjury and Rebellion with a witness; and no Man who hath not his Ear bored, and is became a Slave to Interest, can have the Face to deny it: And yet for all that he goes on. <HI>If it be not Perjury and Rebellion in those Conquer'd Provinces, How comes it to be so here?</HI> By which we say again, he is ready to <HI>maintain,</HI> (for he does here manifestly <HI>suggest</HI> it <HI>already,</HI>) That <HI>England</HI> is the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s by <HI>Conquest,</HI> and all our Lives and Estates are at his Dispo|sal. And there wants nothing but one of his <HI>infinite Snares,</HI> a good rich Deanry, or Bishoprick, to make him <HI>perfectly hold</HI> and <HI>openly maintain</HI> that Opinion. <HI>Parliaments</HI> had best look to such Libels in time, left the pretended Conqueror come to <HI>abdicate them</HI> too as <HI>Vseless,</HI> or <HI>Obstacles</HI> to the pretence of <HI>Conquest,</HI> and make all our Countrey-men become Slaves to his Ambition.</P>
<P>But what meant he by his instancing, <HI>p.</HI> 26, 27. in the <HI>Portugueze's</HI> swearing Allegiance to the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> though the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had enjoyed the <HI>Crown</HI> for Three Generations? The Case was this. There were Three Pretenders to that Crown, and most of the Universities in <HI>Europe</HI> were emploied to determine which of them had <HI>Right</HI>; when <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, while the Thing was yet under de|bate, seeing them encline most to the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> sends the Duke <HI>d' Alva</HI> with an Army, and very <HI>unfairly</HI> Surprizes and Oppresses the Headless Nation, and decided the Controversie by the Sword: This was no <HI>Conquest,</HI> but a manifest <HI>Vsurpation,</HI> for no Battle was fought, nor Resistance made; Was this parallel to the Case of us in <HI>England</HI>? Was our Nation <HI>Headless</HI> at the time of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Inva|sion? Was it <HI>under dispute</HI> whether King <HI>Iames,</HI> or <HI>he</HI> had <HI>Right</HI> to the Crown? Or had King <HI>Iames usurp'd</HI> it, as King <HI>Philip</HI> had done? Was he not in <HI>quiet</HI> Possession of <HI>England,</HI> which King <HI>Philip</HI> never was? The <HI>Portugueze</HI> still grumbling and resenting, that they were enslav'd to a Foreigner, when a King of their own Nation had a Title to it. Again, their swearing Allegiance to King <HI>Philip,</HI> was too, in many regards, more justifiable than <HI>ours</HI>; they were kept under by a Foreign <HI>Force,</HI> whereas we do it <HI>voluntarily</HI>: Besides, the Spanish King had been one of the <HI>Pretenders,</HI> and the <HI>Question was not decided.</HI> Had the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or his Princess, any kind of <HI>pretence</HI> to <HI>England</HI> while their Father liv'd? Lastly, They rose against a <HI>Foreign</HI> King to in|troduce one of their <HI>own</HI> Nation, whereas we rose against our <HI>own</HI> to introduce a <HI>Foreigner.</HI> How shallow then is it to huddle together many Instances, and not bring one of them home to his purpose? How ri|diculous to argue all along from Matters of <HI>Fact</HI> to Matter of <HI>Right</HI>? Which is just as wise as to pretend, that whatever <HI>has</HI> been <HI>done,</HI> must be <HI>well done</HI>; and is the same, as if he would set himself to prove, that we were not the <HI>first,</HI> nor the <HI>only</HI> Rebels, Traytors, or Perjured Per|sons, that have been in the <HI>World</HI>; but that there have been <HI>others,</HI> both of our <HI>own</HI> and <HI>other</HI> Nations before us, which we never denied.</P>
<P>He has not done with his Plot, to prove the Paper none of Mr. <HI>Ash|ton</HI>'s; but (take which you will) tells you <HI>p.</HI> 28. That either 'tis not his, or else that <HI>he contradicted himself.</HI> In what I beseech him? Why.
<PB N="44" REF="23">
Mr. <HI>Ashton,</HI> at his Tryal said <HI>He could not but own he had a fair Tryall for his Life,</HI> and yet in his Paper he complains of the <HI>severe Charge of the Iudges,</HI> and <HI>hard Measure</HI>: And where lies the Contradiction? Every Man knows that the <HI>Tryall</HI> is over before the <HI>Charge</HI> is given, or the <HI>Verdict</HI> brought in by the Jury: So that nothing hinders but the <HI>Tryall</HI> may be fair, and seemingly kind, though the <HI>Charge</HI> which came after did aggravate, and made the worse Misconstruction (as indeed it did) of every thing, and so was very <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>severe.</HI> But does Mr. <HI>Ash|ton</HI> mention no <HI>hard Measures</HI> besides? Does he not object his <HI>close Imprisonment,</HI> the <HI>hasty and violent Proceedings against him, and the In|dustry used in the Return of fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting Persons to pass upon him, the denying of him a Copy of the Panel,</HI> with an <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at the end of them? Were not these <HI>hard Measures,</HI> and some of them villanously unjust, and indeed plainly shewed, that since they saw him so heartily honest, that he would not be warpt, the Resolution was taken beforehand by the Par|ty to have his Life, <HI>per Fas aut Nefas</HI>? Does he deny these were <HI>hard Measures,</HI> or that Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI> said true, when he told us he had receiv'd such <HI>hard Measures</HI>? He confesses <HI>both,</HI> by his Silence in such main Businesses. Is it not a rare piece of Justice, to cull out a select Com|pany of Court Pick-thanks, who they were sure would hang him; and yet deny a Copy of the Panel, that he might except against some chief <HI>Boute-feus,</HI> (and particularly that malicious Jury Man he so complains of,) who would never leave pressing and solliciting the rest, till they brought them (let the Cause be never so ugly) into the same Guilt of <HI>Murther</HI> with themselves? Yet a Man who loses his Life by such Tricks, is (according to this Caviller) <HI>confident, uncharitable,</HI> or whatever other Character his time-serving Spite thinks fit to put upon him, if he do but barely speak of what they <HI>did</HI> to take away his Life.</P>
<P>Now after all this Outcry and heavy Charges, to lay Load upon the Martyr's Credit, what was it he said: <HI>Though I have,</HI> I <HI>think, just rea|son to complain of the severe Charge given by the Iudges, and the hard mea|sure,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Yet as I hope for Pardon at the Hands of my God, I do most heartily pray for and forgive them,</HI> &amp;c. Could any thing be said <HI>more sweetly,</HI> or <HI>more modestly</HI>? He onely spoke it <HI>in Transcursu,</HI> and as a Transition to the declaring his Charitable Forgiving of his Enemies: He onely said [<HI>he thought</HI>] he had received ill Usage, and why might not he <HI>think</HI> so, when his Lawyers told him the Law did not reach him, there being onely <HI>Presumption,</HI> which was <HI>incompetent</HI> in that Case? Yet this uncharitable Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iller charges him with <HI>Confidence,</HI> and want of <HI>Common Charity,</HI> and employs all his little Tricks of Rheto|rick to have it thought he dyed an ill Man, and (which is the worse Sin of the two) to <HI>murther</HI> as far as he could, his <HI>Soul,</HI> and his Credit as a good Christian, after the Judges and Jury had <HI>murthered</HI> his <HI>Body.</HI></P>
<P>But how does he clear the Jury? He cites my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> p. 29. that the <HI>Intent is to be discovered by Circumstances,</HI> &amp;c. But does he or any Man say, that those Circumstances must not be <HI>evidently connected</HI> with the <HI>Intention</HI>; that is, such as <HI>could not</HI> have light or could <HI>not</HI> have been put, had there not been such an <HI>Intention</HI>? Otherwise the Evidence rises not above <HI>Presumption,</HI> which that Lawyer declares to be insufficient; and therefore he requires <HI>Good and Manifest Proof</HI>; and
<PB N="45" REF="23">
the Proof of a Man's <HI>Intention</HI> cannot be said to be <HI>manifest,</HI> unless the Over-act was manifestly connected with it. Was it so here? <HI>Ashton</HI> clear'd the occasion of his going over to <HI>France</HI> to have been upon a quite different Account. But the Papers, says he, were <HI>found about him.</HI> What then? Might not another who was in the Company, and who onely was conscious of their Contents, give them to him to keep? Nay, would not that Person who was concerned judge it <HI>best</HI> in Reason, rather to give them to a Person which was <HI>not at all</HI> concer|ned in them, than to another of his own Gang? Certainly he would. Nothing more frequent in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Days, than for loyal Gentlemen go|ing in Coach, to give such Papers which were Treasonable in those days to the Coachman, or some Gentlewomen in Company; and must such Persons who carried them be concluded guilty of Treason? This Circumstance then of having the Papers found upon him, which were evidently <HI>another</HI> Man's Concern, as being writ in <HI>his</HI> hand, was so far from being <HI>manifestly connected</HI> with <HI>his</HI> being concerned in them, or <HI>knowing their Contents</HI>; that, of the two it rather signifies the <HI>contrary.</HI> Besides, this Circumstance is not rightly represented. Had they been found upon him when <HI>first search'd,</HI> it might have born a sleight Suspi|tion, that he was the Bearer of them; but when he was first forc'd out of the hiding Place, he was search'd, and nothing found about him; but going down afterwards to the Hold of the Ship, and finding those Papers left, (which he might suspect my Lord <HI>Preston</HI> would not have had found,) he put them in his Bosome, with design to throw them over-board, which being observed, they were found there. Well; but he had a mind to have these Papers thrown over-board: What then? Would not any Friend do the same, if his Friend and Fellow-Traveller, who by leaving his Letters behind him where he lay, had by so doing signified, that he would not have them seen, though at the same time he <HI>knew</HI> nothing of the <HI>Contents.</HI> Did not Captain <HI>Billop</HI> at the Tryal declare upon Oath, that Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> was much more concerned than he was, and yet no Presumptive Evidence was groun|ded thereupon against him, of knowing their Contents? Again, Are there no <HI>Secrets,</HI> and <HI>important</HI> Ones too, but <HI>Treason</HI>? What Man who is versed in the World would have made such a <HI>rash Conclusion</HI> of his knowing the Contents of the Letters from a Carriage, as was lately shew'd <HI>has sometimes,</HI> and <HI>may often</HI> be used in other Occasions, where he that <HI>destroys</HI> or <HI>conceals</HI> any Papers of another's, is yet utterly ignorant of what's in them, or what is his Friend's Design? My self in the Protector's Days lodged near the <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> when a Civil Gen|tleman came to take a Room in the same Hou'e; it seems he came over to <HI>England</HI> about King <HI>Charles</HI> his Business, though he kept it to himself, and never in the least had acquainted me with it; upon a fright he came running from the Yard into the House, and feating a Search, retired into a safe hiding Place, giving me some Papers (which it seems he would not have found <HI>with him</HI>) to secure them if I could, or else to <HI>burn</HI> them. I did not much fear, knowing the Constable; so I lock'd them in a small Trunk of Mine, and put them under the Beds-head. They search'd but found nothing. Here is a Case paral|lel exactly, or rather far more obnoxious than was that of Mr. <HI>Ashton's,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="24">
and more significant, that I was privy to the Design of them. Now I would ask this inconsiderate Jury, whether, had those Papers (which I understood afterwards to be <HI>Commissions</HI>) been found in <HI>my</HI> Trunk, they would have brought me in <HI>guilty</HI>? Doubtless such a Jury as <HI>this</HI> would have done it; and yet I can safely be deposed, That I was then utter|ly ignorant, both of the <HI>Business</HI> of that Gentleman, and of the <HI>Con|tents</HI> of the Papers. I desire those <HI>Gentlemen of the Iury</HI> to lay their Hands on their Hearts, and tell us seriously, whether they durst have ventured their own Lives, (could it have been brought to the Tryall,) that Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI> intended to go into <HI>France</HI> with such a <HI>Design</HI>? I doubt their Hearts would quail at such a <HI>dubious</HI> Wager: And could they think fit to take away another Man's Life, and hazard to damn their own Souls too, on an Evidence that they durst not stake their own Lives upon. Let them reflect how often even <HI>very great Likeli|hoods</HI> deceive us every day; nay, sometimes so great, that we should have judged it almost <HI>impossible</HI> it should have <HI>missed</HI>; and yet no wise or good Man would venture his <HI>Life</HI> or his <HI>Salvation</HI> upon those <HI>highest Likelihoods,</HI> or think fit to <HI>swear</HI> the Truth of them; and dare <HI>Iuror<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> then hazard to <HI>forswear</HI> themselves, and to commit Murther in to the Bargain, by bringing in an illegal Verdict, which takes away a Man's Life upon <HI>Likelihoods</HI> or <HI>Presumptions</HI>? The Law he confesses requires <HI>ma|nifest Proof</HI>; What says this Patron of Injustice to the Law? Yet <HI>this Proof</HI> (says he, page 29.) <HI>must still be such as the thing will bear.</HI> Let us examine the sense of these Words. Either he means by the Word [<HI>Thing,</HI>] a Fact of such a Nature as Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI>'s is pretended to be, and that such a Fact, <HI>abstractedly speaking,</HI> cannot bear a <HI>more manifest</HI> Proof than this had: Or he means that this individual pretended Fact, as standing under the Circumstances it <HI>really had,</HI> can bear no better Proof than it did, or be made <HI>more manifest.</HI> He cannot without ex|treme Folly mean the <HI>former</HI> of these: For it is evident and confessed here, p. 30. by himself, That had the Papers been produced <HI>writ in his own hand, it would have been a plain Proof of his knowing what was in those Papers,</HI> (which by the way, is a plain Confession, that (that Proof wanting) there was no <HI>plain</HI> or <HI>manifest</HI> Proof at all,) He must mean then, <HI>that this Fact, no better circumstanc'd, can bear no better Proof</HI>: Which is in less candid Terms to say; <HI>We were resolved to hang him, and could have been glad of a plain or manifest Proof, but the Evi|dence we could get from all the Circumstances, not bearing or affording as such a Proof, we were forced to condemn him upon this unmanifest Proof, or else</HI> (which would have vexed us) <HI>we must have acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted him.</HI> This is what he would say, had he the Gift of Ingenuity. Well then, since there was (as he confesses) no <HI>plain</HI> or <HI>manifest</HI> Proof, what Proof will he afford us instead of it? Why, he tells us, <HI>there was sufficient Proof of his Privity to the Contents of those Papers.</HI> Sufficient! What does he mean by that indeterminate and insignificant Expression? No Proof is <HI>sufficient</HI> by the Law but what is manifest: But he as good as confesses here, that the Proof was not <HI>manifest.</HI> He can onely mean then by that lukewarm word [<HI>sufficient,</HI>] that the Proof was <HI>sufficient</HI> to take away his Life, if such Judges and such a Jury had the managing of it, who were resolved to sacrifice their Consciences and Honesty to the Fear or
<PB N="47" REF="24">
Favour of Men, and blindly submit them; without Scruple, to the Pleasure of the State.</P>
<P>Next he tells us, <HI>there can be no direct and plain Proofs of a secret In|tention.</HI> How many Tricks are coucht in these few words? What does the word [<HI>direct</HI>] here? Did any Man ever pretend he could <HI>see</HI> a Soul <HI>directly,</HI> or receive Impressions from it in a <HI>streight Line,</HI> as Light and visible Objects come to the bodily <HI>Eye</HI>? Again: What does the word [<HI>secret</HI>] here? Had it not been enough to say, <HI>None can have a plain Proof of an Intention</HI>? But to confound the weak Reader, and colour over the Paradox, he must add [<HI>secret</HI>] to it. Indeed while an Intention is <HI>secret,</HI> 'tis undoubtedly <HI>secret</HI>; but why can there be no plain Proof of an Intention, making it become <HI>not secret</HI>? Certainly the denying this would destroy all humane Negotiation, in all its mai|nest Concerns, and make all our chief Actions <HI>floating</HI> and <HI>uncertain:</HI> It makes all the Execution of the Law <HI>comfortless</HI> to the Judges and Ju|ry, and wickedly <HI>injurious</HI> to the Persons accused; for by this Man's Discourse the former can never tell whether or not they condemn an <HI>Innocent,</HI> and the latter sees his Life and Honor exposed to <HI>Hap-hazard.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Intention,</HI> and that <HI>onely,</HI> which the Law regards, nor is any Action reputed by it to be Felony, Murther, Treason, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unless it be done <HI>Animo Felonico,</HI> &amp;c. with a Felonious <HI>Intention,</HI> &amp;c. and this Intention, according to him, can never be made <HI>plain</HI>; so no Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ving <HI>knows,</HI> or <HI>can know,</HI> who dies <HI>deservedly,</HI> who <HI>innocently.</HI> Let him reflect, that all that the <HI>Witnesses</HI> can do is to atrest the <HI>Overt-act,</HI> or the <HI>Words spoken</HI> imprinted on their Senses; but 'tis the Duty of the Judges and Jury, when once they are satisfied of the Witnesses Inte|grity, to see that those Actions are necessarily connected with such an Intention as with its Cause, and proceeded from it; and if they be not satisfied, but that possibly it might spring from <HI>another</HI> Cause, they must be judged not to value how pretious a Man's Life is, nor to re|gard much whether they legally condemn an innocent or no, if they bring him in guilty; and so they incurr the Guilt themselves of <HI>careless Murtherers:</HI> Nor do the Judges deserve a better Character, if they fail in the Duty of instructing them, that the Law requires <HI>manifest Proof,</HI> and that they ought not to proceed upon even <HI>high Likelihoods</HI> or <HI>Pre|sumptions,</HI> which we do experience do often deceive us: But especi|ally if they aggravate and enhance those Likelihoods to make the Ju|ry proceed upon them as <HI>Certainties</HI>: All which was but too visible in the Charge to this easily byast Jury. Did this Gentleman, who de|nies that <HI>Intentions</HI> can admit of <HI>plain Proof,</HI> never hear of those Say|ings, That <HI>out of the abundance of the Heart the Mouth speaketh,</HI> or that <HI>the Tree is known by its Fruit; i.e.</HI> a Man's <HI>Interiour</HI> by his <HI>Outward Actions</HI>? Can we not know very manifestly, that if a Man way-lay his Enemy, and out of an Ambush assaults and runs him through, he had an Intention to do him a Mischief? Does not himself confess, that had the Papers been in Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI>'s own hand, it had been a <HI>plain</HI> or <HI>mani|fest Proof</HI> of his <HI>knowing their Contents</HI>; which <HI>Knowledge</HI> is of its own Nature altogether as <HI>secret</HI> as is an <HI>Intention:</HI> Lastly, Does he not tell us out of my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> that no Proof is sufficient but a manifest one; and yet he sets himself to prove, that there <HI>can be no plain</HI> or
<PB N="48" REF="25">
manifest <HI>Proof of an Intention,</HI> which makes the Law require <HI>Impossi|bilities</HI>? What Stuff is this to be vented by a Man chosen out to sup|port the State, vindicate the Judges, and confute the solid Paper be|queath'd us by our dying Martyr!</P>
<P>After this he pretends, that, <HI>in his Iudgment,</HI> one of the Papers was writ in the <HI>very same Hand in which this Speech was written</HI>; that is, it was <HI>writ by Mr.</HI> Ashton. But he must pardon us if we dare not be|lieve his Judgement, which (as has been abundantly shewn) has scarcely <HI>judg'd right</HI> in one single Line of his whole Book: But how frivolous is this Pretence of his! Had the Judges, or the Managers of the Tryal found the least Ground for such a Suspition, it had been the easiest thing in the World to have compared that Paper with Hundreds of Accomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Acquittances, and Letters, which were all seized in his House by Order from the State: Nor could they have wanted Witnes|ses to have sworn, that they believed such a Paper was writ by him, as well as they did in the Tryal of my Lord <HI>Preston,</HI> which is a very great Presumption that they found no such Paper under his Hand, or so near resembling it as might induce any to swear it. They found in|deed another Paper of his, which more vext them and hastened his Death, than had they found any such other as this Gentleman pre|tends: Concerning which take the Martyr's own Words out of <HI>part of that Paper left by him in a Friend's hands</HI>; which are as followeth.</P>
<Q><P>[Being suddenly to give up my Accounts to the Searcher of all Hearts, I think it a Duty incumbent upon me to impart some Things farther, which neither the Interest nor Iniquity of these Times will, I conclude, willingly bear the publication of, and therefore not fit to be inserted in the Sheriffs Paper.</P>
<P>Some time after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Arrival here, when it was expected, that, pursuant to his own Declaration, and the King's Let|ter to the Convention, an exact Search and Enquiry would have been made into the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> there was a Scheme drawn up of that whole Matter, and of the Proofs that were then (and are still) ready to be produced, to prove his Royal Highness's Legitimacy; but no publick Examination being ever had, and the Violence of the Times, as well as Interest of the present Government, not permitting any private Person to move in it, those Papers have ever since lain by: But it being now thought advisable by some, to have them printed and published, and (as at first they were designed) addressed, at their next Meeting, to the Lords and Commons, en|treating them to enquire into that weighty Affair, and to call forth, examine, and protect (for who else dares to appear) the many Wit|nesses to the several Particulars therein offered to be legally pro|ved, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I was ordered to carry those Papers to the King, my Master, for his view, that his Leave and Approbation might go along with the Desires of his good Subjects here; and they being taken with me, with some other Papers of Accounts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in a small Trunck, amongst my Linen, and other private Things of my own, and not in the Packet, (my Lord <HI>Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton</HI> being altogether a stranger to the whole
<PB N="49" REF="25">
proceeding,) by this means fell into the hands of our present Go|vernours, who, though they wisely waved the producing them as Evidence at my Tryal, yet have I just Reason to believe my greatest Crimes were contained in them; and I do therefore conclude and hope, that I only am designed to be sacrificed, who only knew of them: Nor am I surprised at it, since nothing, I think, can be more prejudical to some Persons present Interest, than the exposing of those Papers to the Publick, which will set that pretended Mystery of Darkness in so clear a Light, that all Mankind must be convinced of his Highness's being Born of the Queen, and of their Wickedness, who have malitiously and designedly asserted that innocent Prince to be an Impostor. The Love and Compassion that I have for my native Countrey, as well as Charity, obliges me humbly to implore Almighty God to be merciful to it, and not to charge this great Sin to the pub|lick Account, and that we may not farther provoke his Justice by our wilfully continuing in Errour and Mistake, I beseech him to put it into the Hearts of the Lords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at their next Meeting, to ex|amine into that whole Matter, and (if before that time this be pub|lished) to enquire after, call for, and, if possible, retrieve those Pa|pers that were taken with me; whereby the Obstinate will most cer|tainly be convinced, the Ignorant informed, the Doubtful confirmed, the Eyes of all opened, and a sacred most important Truth made ap|parent to the whole World.]</P></Q>
<P>And may we not now with good Reason challenge those of the other Party to give an Answer to those Papers, which were the true occa|sion of his Suffering; and in behalf of Justice, Truth, and the good of the Nation, to demand that the said Papers, which are now stiffled, may be produced, and (if possible) confuted: For since never grea|ter fedulity was used by any other to set that Business in a manifest Light; the Answering them must consequently be the surest Means to keep the Nation from being imposed upon in so weighty a Matter. And if this be not done, Will not all sincere Persons conclude hence that the Proofs of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Legitimacy, contained in those Papers of Mr. <HI>Ashton,</HI> are even in the Opinion of our Stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sts them|selves, absolutely <HI>unanswerable,</HI> and all <HI>England</HI> be convinced that the Pretence of his being Supposititious, was set up for no other End but to bring, by that detestable Forgery, the King and Queen into <HI>Odium</HI> and <HI>Disgrace,</HI> and to make way for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to seize on his Crown; and reflect, that from this one villa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous Cheat, all the Cala|mities that have befallen our deluded Nation, have had their true Source and Origin. I know the Observator upon Mr. <HI>Ashton</HI>'s Papers denies there were any such; but could it be done with our Security, we do undertake to prove Circumstantially, that they were in his Trunck when taken by the Government's Order; and farther that we will clear that whole Matter, far more fully than has been done hitherto, by many other Witnesses of unquestionable Credit, and by most convin|cing Proofs; and to satisfie all I terrogatories that can be offered by the most inquisitive Scrupler. But to return to our Juries; What mat|ters it what was brought to light about those Papers <HI>afterwards</HI>? The
<PB N="50" REF="26">
Question is, what Evidence the Jury <HI>then</HI> had, <HI>when</HI> they brought in their lawless Verdict: If they had <HI>at that time</HI> no <HI>such</HI> Evidence as the Law requires; <HI>i.e.</HI> if they had <HI>then no manifest</HI> Proof, he died Inno|cent <HI>in the Eye of the Law</HI>; and nothing can acquit his Condemners from being, according <HI>to the same Law,</HI> and God's Law too, <HI>uncon|scientious Murderers.</HI> And 'tis of <HI>this</HI> kind of Innocence only the Mar|tyr speaks, when he declares himself <HI>Innocent</HI>; about which P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssage this Gentleman, who can neither understand <HI>another Man,</HI> nor many times <HI>himself</HI> very well, is very Gay and Pleasant: Though, 'tis true, the Martyr by owning his Duty to his lawful Sovereign, does withall, by consequence profess, that, though he had been legally Convicted of an <HI>intention</HI> to <HI>restore</HI> him, and of <HI>acting</HI> too, in order to that good End, he had notwithstanding been Innocent also <HI>before God.</HI></P>
<P>The Result of all the whole foregoing Discourse is this, That our blessed Martyr is clearly <HI>vindicated</HI> from any <HI>Treasonable Guilt,</HI> and proved to have died <HI>doubly Innocent</HI>; in the sight of <HI>Heaven,</HI> in dying for his <HI>Allegiance,</HI> which provok'd this unreasonable Malice against him; and <HI>in the Eye of the Law,</HI> by being adjudg'd to die without <HI>manifest Proof,</HI> or legal Evidence. May his Noble Christian Fortitude, and his Pious Example, so influence his <HI>Prevaricating Brethren,</HI> that they may repent them of their <HI>Perjury</HI> and <HI>Rebellion,</HI> imitate his <HI>Con|stant Loyalty,</HI> and be partakers of that Eternal Crown of Glory which he now enjoys, for undauntedly owning, and even to Death persevering in his Duty of Allegiance to his <HI>only Lawful,</HI> and <HI>only Rightful</HI> Sovereign.</P>

<HEAD>An Humble Petition to the Present Government.</HEAD>
<P>SInce Nature does generally encline every Man to avoid his own Ruine, and to do that which is apparently best for his own world|ly Interest and Conveniency; it cannot in common Reason and Pru|dence be imagined, but that the generality of those, who do adhere to King <HI>IAMES</HI> his Title, would be glad to live at Ease, and out of Danger, by submitting freely to the present Government, did not some Consideration that is of a Superior Nature, and concerns their well-being in another World, over-awe them and deter them from owning it. Wherefore as we who write this, <HI>do</HI> in our Names, so we justly presume we <HI>may</HI> in the Names of those others, protest in the presence of Almighty God, who sees their Hearts, that our refusing to take the Oath, and pay a voluntary Allegiance to the present Go|vernours, does not spring from any inclination to Faction, nor from Obstinacy, nor yet from any Disaffection to their Persons; but purely from this, That we cannot be satisfied, either by our own Reason, or any Thing that has been hitherto writ upon that Subject, that they have <HI>any</HI> Title to the Crown, either by the Law of <HI>God</HI> or <HI>Man</HI>; but, on the contrary, that both <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Humane Laws</HI> are <HI>against</HI> their wresting it, by a <HI>Trick,</HI> out of the Hands of their Father, who was the <HI>undoubted rightful</HI> Owner of it; and that their still <HI>Possessing</HI> and <HI>Detaining</HI> it from him, is no less <HI>against</HI> the <HI>same Laws,</HI> and conse|quently <HI>a doubly-unjust Vsurpation</HI>: And therefore our Conscience tells
<PB N="51" REF="26">
us, That we shall incurr the just Indignation of Almighty God; and withal, become Obnoxious, by our English Laws, to the Punishments due to <HI>Traitors,</HI> should we yield to such illegal Compliances. Where|fore we humbly Petition, That for satisfaction to our Consciences, our Governours would please to give Order, that some grave and learned Man may compile a Treatise, shewing <HI>their true</HI> Title to the Crown, and manifesting how King <HI>Iames</HI>'s legal Title, by Succession, comes to be <HI>annull'd</HI>: And let him evince these Two main Points from any solid Principles, of what nature soever, acknowledg'd for such by the indifferent part of the World; and so that it may appear by their giving Authority to that Treatise, by such their Order, that <HI>that</HI> is the <HI>true Ground</HI> of their Claim, and the Title they will <HI>stand by.</HI> Those who have writ in Justification of their Government, are in so many Minds about the <HI>Ground</HI> of their pretended <HI>Right,</HI> that instead of <HI>clear|ing</HI> it they have, by their Disagreement, satisfied all understanding Men, that 'tis <HI>very obscure,</HI> even to their <HI>own Party</HI>; whereas yet it ought to <HI>be of it self,</HI> or else <HI>be made</HI> most <HI>Evident,</HI> e'er it can in any Reason be held able to overthrow a Tenure so <HI>incontestibly Evident</HI> and <HI>Legal,</HI> as was that of King <HI>Iames,</HI> it being built on a long continued H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">redi|tary Succession, abetted by the most Fundamental Laws of the Land, and approved by the universal acknowledgement of the whole World. We humbly request then to be inform'd which of those many Grounds, advanc'd by their Writers, themselves will think fit to make choice of, and esteem <HI>thus Evident,</HI> which we have not hitherto any Light to guess at. Their Carriage by carressing and advancing Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> seems to hint that they most approve of his new Notion; but that Flash of his has been so perfectly and so manifoldly baffled, and laid flat beyond all possibility of setting it up again, or supporting it, that (next to the <HI>Abdication</HI> Title) no Tenet in the World was ever so notoriously con|victed of Folly and Inconsistency. We are told that Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> is about publishing something upon that Subject, with a disclaim of any other Title but that he is setting up: But as we are well assured that the Principles that Gentleman will proceed upon, (however he may pretend to wrest our Laws to his Fancy,) are purely <HI>Commonwealthish,</HI> and no less confident that our Governours will never think it Honour|able for them to own such a <HI>precarious</HI> Authority; so we cannot think it safe in Conscience for us to acquiesce in such a Title, which they themselves will not think fit to acknowledge and <HI>abide by.</HI></P>
<P>This Request is for another Regard the more Reasonable, because the granting it is clearly the best for the Interest even of our Governours themselves: For nothing can be more Prevalent to unite all <HI>England</HI> in a hearty Subjection to their Government, than the making out Evi|dently, and <HI>Inconfutably</HI> (in Case they judge it fecible) upon what Ground we may justly hold the former Prince's rightful Title is <HI>Ex|tinguished,</HI> and their own rightfully <HI>Introduced</HI> and <HI>Established.</HI> Nor can an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Thing more acquit them from the heavy Imputation of Cruelty and Murder, (which <HI>Odium</HI> they will otherwise lie under,) than will shew|ing their Right to be thus Evident: I say <HI>Evident</HI>; for plain Reason very sensibly informs every honest Christian, that a Title which was <HI>never doubted</HI> or <HI>controverted,</HI> nor had the least flaw in it, by any one pre|tender
<PB N="52" REF="27">
in the whole World, ought not to be held abolish'd by a Title which is <HI>controverted</HI> and <HI>dubious</HI>; and also that <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> of Allegiance ought not to be <HI>sworn</HI> to those whose <HI>Right</HI> to our Allegiance is <HI>doubtful</HI> and <HI>uncertain.</HI> Wherefore let them but take away this <HI>doubtfulness,</HI> by making their Title <HI>Clear</HI> and <HI>Evident</HI>; and then the <HI>same</HI> Reason which makes us yet retain our Allegiance to King <HI>Iames,</HI> will oblige us in Conscience to become <HI>Faithful</HI> and <HI>Obedient</HI> Subjects to the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI>; and will shew, moreover, that we enjoy under them a State of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI> and are not purely under the <HI>sla|vish</HI> Condition of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Fear.</HI></P>
<P>The granting then this Humble Petition of ours being every way so <HI>Reasonable</HI> and Advantagious to their own Honour and Interest; so satisfactory to those who have Scruples, which hinder their Complying; so agreeable to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Declaration, which promises not to persecute for Conscience sake; so conducive to the Peace and Union of the Kingdom in general; and, lastly, so necessary to clear the Hon|our of all their own Party, now lying under the Scandal of Complying they know not why, and of Sacrificing their <HI>Consciences</HI> to <HI>servile Fear</HI> or <HI>base Interest</HI>: If this be refused by the State, and yet Oaths be still press'd upon the <HI>Iacobites,</HI> and they be still Persecuted, Imprisoned, and put to Death, for performing their conscientious Duties to him whom they cannot but judge as yet to be their rightful Prince, then they do call Heaven and Earth to witness that they suffer for <HI>Con|science</HI> sake; and that the pretended Governours are resolved to ruine them, for no other Reason but that they will not, to second and up|hold their unaccountable Authority, break God's holy Commands, and our own Laws; which all good <HI>Christians</HI> and true <HI>English-men</HI> are bound to observe.</P>
<P>On the other side, their not yielding to this Humble Request cannot but redound highly to their Dishonour; for all thinking Man will easily make this Inference from their refusal, that either they do not judge they have any Title at all, which will <HI>bear the Test,</HI> or which they will <HI>stand to</HI>; or else, that they are most cruel and most unchristian Persecu|ters: While, on the one hand, they refuse, when humbly Supplicated, to take Order to give satisfaction to Men's Consciences, in a Case which the many Controversies about it, and the former <HI>long settled</HI> and <HI>legal</HI> Title shews to be (at least) <HI>Dubious</HI>; and on the other side, they go on to punish and put Men to Death, who are <HI>desirous</HI> to be satisfied, merely for acting <HI>according to their Consciences</HI>; which those Men themselves are not able to satisfie, that they ought to submit volun|tarily to the Present Government; and those who should be <HI>most able</HI> are <HI>most concern'd,</HI> nay absolutely, in many regards, <HI>bound</HI> to do it, refuse them that Christian Charity.</P>
<P>In a word, Let the Present Governours either <HI>satisfie</HI> our <HI>Consciences,</HI> or leave off to <HI>persecute</HI> us for being <HI>Conscientious</HI>; or, else (which is only left) let them speak out, and tell the World in plain Terms, what this refusal of theirs will sufficiently intimate, that they will do <HI>neither</HI>; but that they are resolved we shall be punish'd as <HI>Traitors,</HI> if we will not be <HI>Knaves</HI>; and that they will only allow us this sad Choice, to be either <HI>Hang'd</HI> or <HI>Damn'd.</HI></P>
