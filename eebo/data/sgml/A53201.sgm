<L>That was no time for <HI>Verse,</HI> the <HI>Furies</HI> reign'd,</L>
<L>Hell was let loose, and Joy was driven from men:</L>
<L>But now the <HI>Goblins</HI> flee, old <HI>Cerberus</HI> is chain'd;</L>
<L>And now the Muses and the Graces reign agen:</L>
<L>Now every Muse that could but creep before,</L>

<L>This year <HI>December</HI> is the Muses <HI>Spring.</HI></L>
<L>It should an Iliad be, for why</L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> and his <HI>Myrmidons</HI> are come:</L>
<L>They shake the mighty Walls of <HI>Rome;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Rome,</HI> that of old was call'd <HI>New Troy.</HI></L>

<L>To <HI>Baal</HI> they cry aloud, and to their <HI>Goddess</HI> call,</L>
