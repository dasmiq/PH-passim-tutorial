<P>How, man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>True man; there's an Art in't will puzel all the Poets
and Legerdemane&mdash;men living. A friend in a corner is as good as a
penny in a man's Purse, I need say no more.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now sirrah, say I've brought you acquainted with a
trusty <HI>Trojan,</HI> one that does prize his friend, that's such as I am,
that scornes to be behind hand in requital. If thou wilt be of our
Society, then study that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoake.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this hand thou know'st I am as prodigall of my
Master's Goods as another can be of his; If I can serve <HI>Rasy</HI> in
any thing relates to our Trade he shall command me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>why, that's well said; I'le tell him so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="4">
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do, I warrant him a witty fellow: I like his way
of scoring White-Wine for Sack, 'tis ingenious, &amp; undiscoverable.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unless the Master come into the Room, and smell into
the Pot.</P>

<SP>

<P>That's but a hazard, and care must mannage it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou dost inspect well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not ignorant of good fellowship Froth; and have
been at the like sport in the City, when the visible Pint of Sack
has past the Barr, and the merry quart Bottle by cleanely convey|ance
brought in the Breeches, &amp; dedicated to good fellows; &amp; now
&amp; then (as the house fills, and Company resolv'd to stay,) a Quart
scor'd in the Crown and brought to us in the Myter, for which
the elevated Gentlemen pay, and we pass upon Paroll, that is, to
return again, and be merry upon the like accompt; and these are
kindnesses I meet withall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how dost thou requite 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know <HI>Froth,</HI> I hate to be ingrate, I will not boast my

Nutmeg, Cloves, all sorts of Spices and Tobacco, they shall
march in Pounds and Ounces to my friends, Lads.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou dost well, here's one that would be one of us, and
though I say it an intelligible puppy, one will come to hand upon
a good occasion; Mr. <HI>Pepper</HI>'s man the Grocer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you call him Gynney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>Smoak,</HI> or what you will, but certainly his proper
name is <HI>Smoaker,</HI> for that the Pipe is ne're out of his mouth; how|ever
he's good natur'd, and true hearted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fitter for our Company.</P>

<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>He swears he is so ta'ne with thine, thou shalt not want
any thing his Masters Shop affords.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank ye, <HI>Froth</HI> knows me well enough.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>And thou know'st me well enough <HI>Rasey:</HI></P>

<P>I Rogue, we are brothers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="5">
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will intitle me too, and if you want a fourth
man, I'le bring one that is true blew, an Oyle-man's Apprentice,
who shall furnish you better, and with more variety then he that
cryes your Olives, your Capers, your Samphire, your Barbaries,
your Cowcumbers, your Anchoves, and your new Pickl'd Oy|sters,
and cost you nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means let's know him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>A kind soul, and will spend his Money freely too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or else he does nothing,&mdash;will he Game.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never try'd him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now thou talk'st of Gaming, what's become of the lit|tle
Dapper Clark, how does he hold out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pox take him, he won four pound of me but t'other
day, I hope to retreive it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast only drawn him in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, hang him, were he as good at Clerkship as he is at
Gaming, he'd get more Money then his Hide could carry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he so good at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is his prayers and his daily bread; and yet I know
sometimes he wants a dinner, but that is when his Mint is broke
and he wants recruting; for the best of Gamsters does not al|wayes
winne, and then the Rogue will spend high when he has it,
Whores a little, and keepes himself neat and trim, fit for good
Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this hand <HI>Rasey,</HI> now we are Brothers (for I will be
so whether thou wilt or no) if thou beest excellent at that sport, I
will bring thee acquainted with such a young fry of Apprentices
thou shalt want for no Commodities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this hand I'le go snip, and so shalt thou.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed, agreed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should not we four that is our brother Oyleman,
(as yet unknown to you,) our brother Vintner here, our brother
Tapster, and <HI>Ego</HI> my own self, brother to all, love one ano|ther?
the Drapery, and the Mercery Pedees comply to cheat their
Masters in gross, to please their Concubines, ('twere Porter like to
say Whors,) &amp; we never cheat our Masters but in parcels to please
our selves and keep up merry Society, and for ought I know our
<PB REF="5">
Masters are greater Cheats then we are, what say you Brothers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>A learned speech, you have hit right,&mdash; <STAGE>within, why Rasey.</STAGE>
I come, I come; the truth on't is I could
say something as to our own calling, as to Balme and Shamlee, the
merry mixtures, stumings, and sophistications, but it is an ill Bird
defiles its own Nest they say; and truly I think it not necessary
for a man to discover the adulterations and deceits in his own
Calling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though we can say something as to our Callings too,
'tis wisdome to hold our peace, the truth on't is, Cheating like the
Wandring <HI>Iew</HI> is every where; but of all cheats I hate your
Coffee-House cheat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why a <HI>Turk</HI>'s as bad as a <HI>Iew,</HI> if not worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part I think they are principl'd alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the vanity of our Nation is such, that rather then
we shall cheat'em they'l bring in the divel to do't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Song in three parts, the <HI>Iew,</HI> the <HI>Turk,</HI> and the Devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Troth <HI>Rasey</HI> some of your quality are serv'd in their
kind, and suffer for their own sinnes, what had they to do to take
anothers calling upon them, to sell Ale in silver Tankerds, ordered
with Sugar, and a nick name, and sell it for 6^d. a Pint, half pint? and
then Beer put into a Rhenish Wine Cask and sold for <HI>March</HI> Beer,
strew'd with a little Sugar at a groat a Tankerd, and all to cozen
the poor Victualler.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am coming,&mdash;howe're I have a plaguy spleen at the
Coffee-House that cheats us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he cheats not us, we furnish him with Tobacco, and
he payes honestly, but still he is but a <HI>Turk</HI> as the Song goes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rasey.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I could meet with some Poet that would handle
the Humours of the Coffee-House a little, as I'm a Christian I'd
be civil to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Froth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know one, <HI>Rasey,</HI> that does love thee dearly; I must
confess he cares not much for me, yet he will take his mornings
draught in Ale, to please his company, but Sack is his best mistress,
Coffee he abhominates.</P>

<P>How dare not! art thou a fool, I'd fain see whether my

<P>You talk merrily.</P>

<P>You wrong my Husband there, he scornes to beat me.</P>

<P>The happier she; and yet you do not hear me com|plain,
I am contented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fraile.</SPEAKER>
<P>So are patient fooles; but women that have wit, are
not so tame: if thou wilt see a Play it shall cost thee nothing, I'le
warrant thee a Ticket, sh'as a friend, a Player, a pretty fellow that
at any time will pleasure her, and her friends too.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olive.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not love to buy my pastime at so dear a rate.</P>

<P>How like an Asse thou talk'st, 'tis wonderous pritty to

<P>Oh fie upon't, there will no good come on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fraile.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if her friend take her to <HI>Finsbury,</HI> (as now and
then we must go see our Cosen supposed living somewhere,) she
leaves word, and he perhaps soberly followes after, and if she's
gone from thence, or never was there, she is prepar'd with an ex|cuse
for either, 'gainst she comes home; your Players are huge
witty and fit a Woman for that purpose rarely; which the good
man does hugg with eager credit, and gives his friend thanks for
the care he had of his dear wife. This is the fruit of Tickets; now
if you'l see a Play, be one of us, we'l find you Tickets and your
Husband too.</P>

shut thy self up in shop, and stinck a Moneth, then come abroad to

<SPEAKER>Samphire.</SPEAKER>
<P>A shrew'd woman able to break a man's back if he
had no other wayes to do't, but I've a Mistress so far from those
wayes, she is as modest, as loving, and as carefull a wife as any in
the City; when he has been out all night and perhaps lost twenty
<PB REF="10">
or thirty pound at Dice, she takes no notice on't, but bids him wel|come
home i'th morning with all the sweet words she can devise,
gives him a Cawdle, has him to bed, and there he sleeps till three

<P>A brave woman, mirour of Patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samphire.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I've o're heard him swear unto himself, he fear'd
he should be damn'd for wronging so good a wife, and by this hand
the very thought of her sets me into a trembling; when I'm a|bout
to steal Oyle, Oysters, Anchoves, or any other Comodity to
pleasure a friend, but when I consider that it cannot last, and he
must break if he holds on his course, I then take hardy grace and
make me friends of the unrighteous Mammon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smoak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me not live if't ben't the wisest course, I promise
you I practice it, I find my Master draw one part of the house his
way, and my Mistress drawes another part her way; and if I (lying
in the Shop) don't draw another part my way, let the Rafters of
the house fall upon my head.</P>

<P><HI>Froth</HI> has the same trick too, and so has <HI>Rasey</HI> (but not
