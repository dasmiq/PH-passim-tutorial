<P>This also may teach all Clergy men to be faithfull and painfull in their calling, that they likewise may finde such confidence toward God, as <HI>Paul</HI> had, euen letters testi|moniall of their indefatigable diligence written in their owne consciences. It is an easie matter in a corrupt age to be well beneficed, <HI>aut errore hominis, aut aere Simonis;</HI> as one wittily: but to play the part of a good Pastor, (as <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Pastoral. part. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Gregory</HI> the great said) is <HI>ars artium, &amp; scientia scientia|rum.</HI> A Prelate therefore must not lay a Bishopricke vn|der his feete, making one dignity a step vnto another: but he must lay it vpon his shoulders, and remember that as Bishops enioy honour by their place, so they sustaine a burthen in their office.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="6">
thing) <HI>carry with them a note of the Popish seruile feare, and sauour not of that confidence and reuerent familiarity, that the children of God haue through Christ with their heauenly Father.</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">D^r. <HI>Whitgift</HI> defen. of his answer to the admonit. pag. 493.</NOTE> Answere is made, that acknowledging of our vnworthinesse is the ground of humility, and that hu|mility is a principall ornament of Praier, and in a sutor such a commendable vertue, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hooker. ecc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e polit. l.</HI> 5. &sect;. 47.</NOTE> that the testification ther|of argueth a sound apprehension of his supereminent glo|ry before whom wee stand, and putteth also into his hands a kinde of bond or pledge for security against our vnthankefulnesse: the very naturall roote whereof is alwaies either ignorance, dissimulation, or pride. Ig|norance, when wee know not the Author from whom our good comes: dissimulation, when our hands are more open then our eyes vpon that we receiue: pride, when wee thinke our selues <HI>worthy</HI> of that which vnde|serued fauour and meere grace bestoweth. And therefore to abate such vaine imaginations in our prayer <HI>with the true conceit of vnworthinesse,</HI> is rather to preuent, then commit a fault: and it sauoureth not of any basenesse or seruile feare; but rather of great trust in Gods mercie: for those things which wee for our vnworthinesse dare not aske, wee desire that God for the worthinesse of his Sonne would notwithstanding vouchsafe to grant. The knowledge of our vnworthinesse is not without faith in the merits of Christ; with that true feare caused by the one, there is coupled true boldnesse and encouragement arising from the other. Euen our very silence, which our vnworthinesse putteth vs vnto, doth it selfe make re|quest for vs, and that in great confidence: for albeit looking inward we are stricken dumbe, yet looking vp|ward we speake and preuaile. So the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Luk. 18. 13.</NOTE> Publicane pray|ing in the Temple, <HI>would not come nigh, nor lift vp his eyes;</HI> and yet you know what Christ pronounced of him, and what a generall rule hee grounded vpon that particular example, to wit, <HI>Euery man that exalteth himself shall be brought low, and he that humbleth himselfe shall be exalted.</HI>

<P><HI>This I say] Paul</HI> in the former verses hath laid downe two propositions; one, that testaments of men confir|med may not bee broken: another, that the promises were made to <HI>Abraham</HI> and his seed, which is Christ. Now what of all this, may some say? Hee doth expound himselfe therefore, <HI>this I say;</HI> that is, the drift and intent of all my speech is to shew that the couenant or testa|ment ratified by God can not bee frustrated. And se|condly, though it might so bee, yet that the Law could not abrogate the same: Which he proues by two reasons especially.</P>
<P>First, from the circumstance of time: <HI>the law which began foure hundred and thirty yeeres after doth not disanull, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, from the nature of a testament, donati|on or legacie: <HI>for if inheritance come of the Law, it com|meth</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="15">
<HI>not of promise; but God gaue it to Abraham by pro|mise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Law which began afterward</HI>] The Iewes obiect and say, that God mistrusting his owne promises as in|sufficient to iustifie, further added a better thing; that is to say, the law, whereby men might be made righte|ous. Our Apostle doth answere by demonstration. <HI>Abraham</HI> obtained not righteousnesse before God through the Law, because there was no Law when hee liued; and if no Law, then assuredly no merit. What then? Nothing else but the meere promise, which <HI>Abraham</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Galat. 3. 6.</NOTE> beleeued, and it was imputed to him for righ|teousnesse. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Luther in loc.</NOTE> If a rich man not constrained therevnto, but of his owne good will, should adopt one to bee his sonne, whom hee knoweth not, and to whom hee doth owe nothing, and should appoint him heire of all his lands and goods; and then after certaine yeeres should lay vpon him a law to doe this or that; hee cannot now say that hee deserued this benefit through his owne workes, seeing hee receiued it of meere fauour many yeeres asore: so God could not respect our deserts go|ing before righteousnesse, for as much as the promise was made 430 yeeres afore the Law. Wherefore, saith <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Vbi sup.</NOTE> <HI>Luther,</HI> if thou wilt rightly diuide the word of truth, accustome thy selfe to separate the <HI>promises</HI> and the <HI>law</HI> so sarre asunder as heauen and earth, as the beginning of the world and the latter end; that when the Law com|meth and accuseth thy conscience, thou maiest answere; <HI>Lady law, thou commest not in season, for thou commest too soone; tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e yet vntill</HI> 430 <HI>yeeres bee full expired, and when they are past, then come and spare not.

The first is applying of Christ crucified, and that is to be|leeue not onely that Christ was crucified for vs: but that we likewise were crucified with him.</P>
<P>The second is to beat downe the flesh by the sword of the spirit, propounding in our daily repentance the seue|rall Commandements and threatnings of God against our seuerall affections and lusts. As it were slaying murther with commandement, <HI>Thou shalt not kill:</HI> and robbing the theefe with another arrow taken out of Gods quiuer, <HI>Thou shalt not steale.</HI></P>
<P>The third is to cut off the first beginnings of euill, and to flie the present occasions of euery sin. With these spiri|tuall nailes (as <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">In lot.</NOTE> <HI>Luther</HI> speakes) a Christian may fasten all carnall desires vnto the Crosse; so that although the flesh be yet aliue, yet can it not performe that which it would doe, for as much as it is bound hand and foote, and made subiect to the spirit.</P>

Hee writ indeed to <HI>Philemon</HI> with his <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Philemon. vers. 19.</NOTE> owne hand, but that Epi|stle was exceeding short in comparison of this: and hee writ larger Epistles vnto the Churches of Corinth and Rome; but by his Scribes, and not with his owne hand. Wherfore seeing this letter is the most long and large that euer himselfe penned, it ought to be more regarded and better accepted; <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Caluin.</NOTE> as his paines were greater in writing, our diligence should be greater in reading and obseruing the same.</P>
<P><HI>With mine owne hand] Haimo</HI> saith it is the Doctours opinion that <HI>Paul</HI> wrot not all this Epistle with his owne hand, but onely from hence to the end; which assertion is contrary to the Text, and truth.

<P><HI>As many as desire with outward appearance</HI>] Heere be|gins the recapitulation, in which our Apostle like a good Orator artificially repeates all those things hee would haue especially remembred in the whole discourse; now the maine proposition of all this large letter vnto the Galathians is, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Cap. 2. v. 16.</NOTE> <HI>that a man is not iustified by cir|cumcision, or any workes of the Law:</HI> but <HI>by the faith of Iesus Christ.</HI> The which is all one with his assertion here, that <HI>Christ crucified</HI> is the sole meanes of our saluation, and onely ground of our spirituall reioycing. <HI>Neither Circumcision, nor vncircumcision auaileth any thing at all, but a creature renued,</HI> that is, endued with <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Cap. 5. 6.</NOTE> <HI>faith work|ing through loue.</HI> Hee doth accuse therefore such as ob|truded <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Cap. 1. 6.</NOTE> another Gospell, an opposite doctrine, but blesse Gods Israel, <HI>euen as many as walke according vnto this rule.</HI></P>

<P>In this description of false Doctours, if thy sight bee quicke, thou maiest apprehend the liuely picture both of a Schismaticke and hereticke, who though outwardly they seeme neuer so great, yet are they the least in the Church of God.

<P>If any shall demand how the false brethren in vrging Circumcision had the world at will, and were made free from persecution? <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Hieron.

So that if a Iew turned Christian, hee had the priuiledges of a Iew so long as hee kept the ceremoniall rites of <HI>Moses:</HI> whereas they who taught that ceremo|nies were abrogated, and that men were iustified onely by faith in Christ, wanted those priuiledges and so were per|secuted of the Iewes, and of the Gentiles too, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Christ cru|cified being a stumbling blocke vnto the Iewes, and vnto the Grecians foolishnesse.</HI> Now the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ansel. in loc.</NOTE> pseudo-Apostle here, lest they should suffer affliction for the crosse of Christ, inuen|ted a new gospell, and made an hotch-potch of religion.

For one man may serue two well agreeing masters inioyning the same thing, as the men of Tyrus <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Kings</HI> 5. <HI>&amp;</HI> 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> 2.</NOTE> hew|ing Cedar trees out of Lebanon for the Temple, serued both <HI>Hiram</HI> and <HI>Salomon.</HI> Againe, this axiome must bee construed <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Pontan. in loc.</NOTE> <HI>in sens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> composito,</HI> not <HI>diuiso:</HI> for other|wise wee may serue diuers masters at diuers times, as <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Luke 19.</NOTE> <HI>Zaccheus</HI> at the first serued the world, yet afterward hee followed Christ. The meaning of this adage then is, that no man at one time, can serue two masters inioy|ning <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Theophylact. Euthym. Anselm.</NOTE> contrarie duties. As for example, God and the flesh are two such masters, <HI>I see</HI> (saith <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Rom. 7. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Paul) another law in my members rebelling against the law of my minde: for the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these two are contrary one to the other:</HI> Galat. 5. 17.

<P>Concupiscence is like to a fire, and our bodie like to a seething pot. Now the pot is cooled foure waies espe|cially:
<PB N="66" REF="36">

<P>Secondly, the pot is cooled by stirring of it; so the fu|rious heate of lust is much abated by the stirring of our bodies, and exercising of our mindes. Vnchast follie for the most part is begot of an idle braine, hatched in a lasie bodie.</P>

<P>Thirdly, we may coole the Pot by casting cold water into it: in like manner abundance of teares is a good meanes to quench outragious flames of this vnruly fire.

Some yoong men may escape, that is, some vaine words and vncleane thoughts as yet may remaine in vs: but as for the old Amelekits, I meane grosse faults and foule transgressions, God will grant vs power and grace to kill all them, and so we shall re|couer all that the Amelekits had taken, we shall rescue

our wiues and daughters, our affections most deare to vs heretofore captiuated vnto lust, shall now doe good seruice to God, acknowledging this infallible rule that <HI>no man can serue two masters.</HI> God and the lust of the flesh.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the Pot is cooled by taking it altogether from the fire; so we may the sooner coole this hot lust which so boyleth in vs, if we shunne opportunities and occasions of sinne.

For <HI>Daniel</HI> a yoong man reproued the lasciuious Elders; <HI>Ioseph</HI> a yoong man resisted the temptations of his owne Mistrisse; <HI>Iohn</HI> the blessed Euangelist a yoong man, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Hieron. ad|uers.

<P><HI>One faith</HI>] The Turke hath his faith, the Iew his faith, the Gentile his faith, Heretikes haue their faith, and Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ismatikes their faith.

<P><PB N="103" REF="54">Answer is made, that to speake properly these are not faiths, but factions; all of them being either vnbeliefes, or misbeliefes. And therefore when the Disciples asked the Lord to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 17. 5.</NOTE> <HI>increase their faith,</HI> it must be construed of increase in measure, that we may grow from vertue to vertue, from knowledge to knowledge, from faith to saith, vntill we be full of growth in Christ Iesus: not of increase in number, for in regard of the manifold rents and diuisions in the Church, it is our dutie contrariwise to pray the Lord, that he will decrease, not increase our faith in number, which is and must be but one.</P>

And in this sense there is but one onely true Catholique and Apostolique faith: if any man on earth, or Angell from heauen shall goe about to deliuer another Gospell, let him bee accursed, Gala|thians 1. 8.</P>

In which respect it is truly called <HI>sauing</HI> and <HI>iustifying</HI> faith. And this (as the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Thom. 22 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st. 4. <HI>art.</HI> 6.</NOTE> Schoole distinguisheth) is <HI>diuersa, ratione subiecti: sed vna, ratione obiecti.</HI> Faith is, and must be diuers in re|gard of diuers beleeuers, for euery man must liue by his <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Habac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. 2. 4.</NOTE> owne faith. <HI>Paul</HI> cannot be saued by the faith of <HI>Peter,</HI> nor <HI>Peter</HI> iustified by the faith of <HI>Iohn.</HI> As euery one must haue <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Matth. 25. 9.</NOTE> Oyle of his owne in his owne lampe: so euery one

Yet faith in regard of hir obiect is but one, for there is but one only di|uine truth, which is the general obiect of faith, and but one only Christ Iesus crucified, who is the speciall obiect of iu|stifying and sauing faith. One only faith, because one only Lord, hir owne only obiect. Albeit faith be diuers in di|uers men, and hath diuers degrees in one man: yet it is but of one kinde in all.

<P><HI>One of the chiefe Pharisies</HI>] It is apparent in the Gos|pels history, that the Pharisies were the greatest enemies vnto Christ, and therfore this being a chiefe Pharisie, was happily one of Christs chiefe enemies. And <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Cyril apud Aquin in loc.</NOTE> yet Christ being inuited, as it should seeme, to his house formally, comes friendly, without any further examination of his intent, and being come, benefits him and his in vttering a parable and acting a myracle, seeking to <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Marlorat.</NOTE> win them all vnto the truth. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ardens.</NOTE> Hereby teaching to blesse such as hate vs, embracing all occasions of loue whereby we may be reconciled vnto our mortall enemies.

<P>Againe, in that this Pharisie was a <HI>Chiefe,</HI> we note that there was among them, as in euery setled society distin|ction of offices and orders.

<P><HI>On the Sabbath day</HI>] The Pharisies inviting and our Sauiours comming on this day, to this dinner, euidently demonstrate that it is not vnlawfull to feast on the Lords day. For if the Iewes might entertaine neighbours and friends on their Sabbath: how much more Christians on our Sunday, being assured, that God is worshipped euen on this day <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Culman. in lot.</NOTE> rather with workes of hospitalitie and charitie, then by fond macerating of our bodies. I write not this against godly fasting, nor yet for vngodly fea|sting. Moderation is the best dish at the table, for immo|derate fasts exceedingly dull vs: and on the contrarie, sanctified feasts in good companie, make vs more fit for deuotion and other duties of the Sabbath, especially when Christ is in presence, when a good man is modera|tor at the boord, whose speech is <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Coloss. 4. 6.</NOTE> <HI>powdred with salt</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 4. 29.</NOTE> <HI>that it may minister grace to the bearers,</HI> edifying his host and all his house. Christ heerein shewed himselfe thankefull and faithfull, hee did not bite his host in present, nor backbite him absent, but in requitall of his good cheere gaue good words, and better aduice. Christ was faithfull also, for wheras it is the fashion of parasites and trencher-Chaplaines to flatter, or at the least, humour great men at their table: he did not deuoure the faults of the chiefe Pharisie with his fowles, and his sinne with his sauce, but correct him and his, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Ians<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n. in lot.</NOTE> instructing their soules while they feed his bodie. This ought to bee the center of all our conuersation and conference, to make those which are bad, good; and those which are good, better.

<P>The Pharisies had <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Pontan.</NOTE> two faults especially, misconstruing of the Scriptures, and pride. Christ here doth rectifie their error in both, in healing a sicke man on the Sabbath, he doth instruct them in the true meaning of the fourth Commandement according to the present occasion offe|red, and in his parable to the guests, hee deliuereth an ex|cellent document concerning their ambition. Hee could haue cured this man, as he did many, with his bare word only; <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Ardent. Iansen.</NOTE> but to shew that all handy workes, as these of cha|ritie, and other of necessitie, as to pull a beast out of a ditch, are not vnlawfull on the Sabbath, he touched him, and by touching healed him.</P>
<P>Two circumstances amplifie Christs exceeding rich mercies in acting this miracle: first, for that he did it vn|asked freely: secondly, for that hee did it with hazard of his credit stoutly. He did helpe the <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Luke 7.</NOTE> Centurions seruant, but vpon entreatie: the <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Matth. 15.</NOTE> womans daughter of Cana, but after a long and earnest sute: the blind <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Mark. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Bartimeus,</HI> but af|ter much crying, <HI>O sonne of Dauid haue mercie on mee:</HI> the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Matth. 17.</NOTE> lunatike, but his father vpon bowed knees asked this boone, <HI>Master haue pitie on my sonne:</HI> whereas this man is cured instantly, without any request of his friends, or prayer of himselfe. Againe, Christ vndertooke this cure with hazard of his honour, wheras other miracles vsually wrought his glory. When hee raised from dead the wi|dowes sonne in Naim, all that were present praised God and said, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Luke 7. 16.</NOTE> <HI>A great Prophet is risen vp among vs, and God hath visited his people:</HI> when hee cured two blind men, Matth. 9. <HI>They spread abroad his fame throughout all that land:</HI> when hee fed about fiue thousand with fiue barley loaues and two fishes, all that saw the miracle, said, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Iohn 6. 14.</NOTE> <HI>This of a truth is the same Prophet that should come into the world:</HI> when he made the deafe to heare, and the dumbe to speake, such as were spectators euen with open mouth as it were cried, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Mark. 7. 37.</NOTE> <HI>He hath done all things well;</HI> but in helping

<P><NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Panigarol. part. 1. hom. in locum.</NOTE> Some for the further amplifying of Christs abundant goodnesse, imagine that the sicke man heere was a para|site to the Pharisies, and that hee came to this feast of his owne accord as a baite to catch Christ, and not with an intent to be cured of his Sauiour. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Maldonat.</NOTE> Other hold this im|probable, conceiuing that he made no suite but held his peace, rather out of <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Cyril.</NOTE> feare then out of loue to the Phari|sies: he did happily beleeue in heart, but lest the Pharisies should excommunicate him, he durst not openly confesse with his mouth that Iesus is the Lord.

Thirdly, inordinate, <HI>wherein is ex|cesse,</HI> making men absolute <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Luther. Beza. Piscator.</NOTE> dissolute, ready to commit all vncleannesse euen with greedinesse. All these being put together, make drunkennesse a grandame in Babylon, and a very monopolie of mischiefe, transgressing euery precept of the whole Law.</P>
<P>The first Commandement is, <HI>Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me.</HI> The meaning whereof Christ expounds it, Matth. 22. 37. is, <HI>thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soule, with all thy minde.</HI> Hee saith not (as <HI>Chrysostome</HI> notes vpon the place) <HI>feare the Lord:</HI> for the most impudent Atheists haue trembled, often in whom there is no perfect loue, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. 18.</NOTE> which expelleth feare. Neither saith hee, <HI>know the Lord:</HI> for heathen men haue some knowledge of God by nature: Psal. 19. 1. The hea|uens declare the glorie of God, and the firmament shew|eth his handie worke. Neither saith hee, <HI>beleeue the Lord thy God:</HI> for the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Iames 2. 19.</NOTE> diuels also beleeue; but hee saith ex|pressely that which is the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 10.</NOTE> fulfilling of the Law, <HI>loue the Lord thy God.</HI> As then our <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. 16.</NOTE> Apostle said, <HI>he is our master to whom we submit our selues as seruants to obey:</HI> so that is our God assuredly which wee like best and loue most. And therefore for as much as the glutton and drunkard is <HI>totus venter</HI> (as <HI>Erasmus</HI> said of a Frier) all belly, and
<PB N="149" REF="77">
all for the belly: without all doubt his belly is his <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Philip. 3 19</NOTE> God, and his glory his shame.</P>
<P>The second Commandement is, <HI>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, &amp;c. thou shalt not bow downe to them, and worship them.</HI> Albeit drunkards cannot endure to kneele one halfe quarter of an houre in the temple: yet they can bee content to kneele, and that on both knees, and those bare, pressing and answering healths in the tauernes either to their good Captaine, who many times is but a swaggerer; or else to their faire Mistrisse, who sometimes is little better then a strumpet; or else forsooth vnto their Soueraigne, vsing the diuels logicke, hee that will not be drunken for <HI>Caesar,</HI> is no friend to <HI>Caesar.</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Hieron. com. in Tit.</NOTE> <HI>Ac|cusationis occasio est, adiuratum per Caesarem frequentius non bibisse.</HI> This vngodly <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Vide Ambros. lib. de Elia, c. 17</NOTE> deuotion and idolatrous ado|ration of he-saints and she-saints, as they protest vnfai|nedly from the bottome of their heart vnto the bottome of the cup, is so full of scandall and scorne, that there can bee but a little difference between a drunkard in vphol|ding his wine-worship, and a Papist in obseruing his will|worship.</P>
<P>As for the third Commandement: a drunkard alway blasphemeth God in his workes, ofter in his words. It is an old prouerbe, Shew me a liar, and I will shew thee a theefe: so shew me a swaggerer, and I will instantly shew thee a swearer. For when once hee begins to seeme to himselfe <HI>valde disertus,</HI> a very fine man, <HI>faecundi calices cumiam fec&ecirc;re disertum:</HI> hee will talke of God most, al|though hee thinke of him least. It is recorded in the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Matth. 8. 31.</NOTE> Gospels historie that the dispossessed diuels entreated Christ that hee would suffer them to goe into swine; be|cause the chiefe place of the diuels residence is the soule of the swilling drunkard. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Matth. 12. 43</NOTE> <HI>In dry places he findes no rest,</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Bonauent. diet. sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t. c. 29.</NOTE> that is, in a sober minde hee gets no footing: hee dwels in low countries and in wet ground, in such as are <HI>filled with wine.</HI> Now when the spirit of God is gone which should direct their speech and guide their thoughts, and
<PB N="150" REF="78">
Satan is entred in and taken possession of their ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">se; then vndoubtedly the doore of their lips is shut vp from Gods praise, but open as hell mouth alway to sweare vain|ly, to forsweare villanously.</P>
<P>Touching the sanctifying of the Sabbath enioyned in the fourth Commandement; an Alehouse in a Parish is or|dinarily the diuels chappell; while Gods congregation is chaunting in the Church, boone companions are chatting in the tauerne, hauing their letanie, gospels and epistles in derision of our common praiers, and the welsh sermon in scorne of our preaching: <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Church hom. concerning the time and place of prayer.</NOTE> so that they more dishonour God, and serue better the diuell on Sunday, then in all the daies of the weeke beside.</P>

<P>The drunkard is occasioned to breake the seuenth Commandement by his large commons, and leaud com|panions.

<P>Secondly, the drunkard is inticed to the sinne of in|continence by leaud company: for although an Inne was called in old time <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Isidor. etym. lib. 15. cap. 2.</NOTE> <HI>propina,</HI> and of late corruptly <HI>popina</HI> of the Greeke <GAP DESC="foreign">, signifying hunger, because Tauerne|houses were first erected onely for the necessary refection of trauellers and strangers, and not for idle meetings of neighbours: yet afterward they became places of noto|rious riot and excesse, in so much that the <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Ecclesiasticus 26. 30.</NOTE> Wise|man said expresly, <HI>Two things are hard and perilous, a Merchant cannot lightly keepe him from wrong, and a Ui|ctualler is not without sinne.</HI> And it is well obserued out of the second chapter of <HI>Iosua,</HI> verse 1. that the word in He|brew vsed for an hostesse signifieth an harlot also, <HI>the messengers of Iosua went into an harlots house,</HI> that is, saith our English glosse, into a Tauerne-house, and in Latine <HI>stabulum</HI> is an Inne, and <HI>prostibulum</HI> a whore. Now the filthy communication and vncomely gestures vsuall in such places and among such persons are so great motiues vnto sinne, that as <HI>Martin Luther</HI> was won<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to say, It is as strange a miracle for a man to conuerse with such and

<P>As for the eighth Commandement: he that is drun|ken with wine first is a theefe to himselfe in his excessiue riot, and then being in neede is occasioned to steale from others also. Drunkennesse is <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Bonauent. diet. salut c. 8.</NOTE> <HI>regius morbus,</HI> a costly sin, for he that draweth his patrimony through his <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Church h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m. against drun|kennesse.</NOTE> throate, eating and drinking more in an houre then hee is able to earne in a whole weeke, must in fine come to beggery: Prouer. 23. 21. <HI>the drunkard and the glutton shall be poore, and the sleeper shall be clothed with rags.</HI> He doth cast his house so long out of the window, that as <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Luscinius in salibus &amp; iocis.</NOTE> <HI>Diogenes</HI> said, at the last his house doth cast him out of the doore, hauing left nothing rich except a rich nose.

A Gentleman hearing that his sonne at Vniuer|sitie was giuen to dicing, answered, that want of money would occasion him happily to leaue that fault.

<P><HI>The kingdome of heauen</HI>] The Church militant on earth, is this kingdome of heauen, I say militant, and that for <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Iacob de Vo|rag. serm. 1. in l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> two reasons especially: first, because this mariage feast is called a <HI>dinner,</HI> vers. 4. and after dinner there fol|loweth another banquet, namely the Supper of the Lamb, Apocal. 19. 9. This dinner then is a feast of grace, that supper a feast of glorie. Secondly, because none can bee thrust out of the Church in heauen triumphant, many croud vnto Gods dinner in the militant without any wed|ding garment or bridelace: but at the last day when hee shall&punc;come to view his guests, hee will cast them out of the wedding chamber into vtter darknesse, as it is in the 13. verse. The Church vnder the crosse then is this kingdome, gathered together by the preaching of the Gospell, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 9.</NOTE> <HI>a chosen generation, a royall priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people.</HI> Not kingdomes in the plurall, but in the singular a kingdome, as being gouerned by one and the same Lord, vnder one and the same law.

Offensiue, <HI>the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.</HI> As for their vse, <HI>Paul</HI> aduiseth vs also to <HI>put them on,</HI> and to put them all on, and so to put on the whole armour, as that we may stand in all good, and withstand all euill. All which is implied in the 11. verse, containing a procla|mation <HI>ad arma, put on all the armour of God.</HI> And a reason, <HI>that ye may stand,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the proclama|tion foure points are remarkable:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Euery Christian is charged with <HI>armour.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. This armour must be <HI>Gods armour.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Panoplia,</HI> complet armour, <HI>all the armour of God.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. This complet armour must not onely be shewed abroad, or hung vp at home: but vsed and im|ployed daily, <HI>put on.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The reason hereof is manifest and manifold: first, that we may be able to <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">For so long as a man standeth in battell he is well, if he fall downe then in ieopardie..</NOTE> <HI>stand</HI> in battell. Secondly, that wee may so stand, as that we may <HI>withstand.</HI> Thirdly, that we may so withstand, as that we may foile our enemies <HI>assaul|ting</HI> as well as retiring. Fourthly, that we may repell not only some few, but <HI>all assaults.</HI> Fiftly, all assaults not on|ly of the flesh and the world, but of the diuell also, which is the prince of darknesse, and generall commander of all forces against vs in these spirituall skirmishes. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Iudith 15. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Olofernes</HI> being slaine, his souldiers instantly fled. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Lombard. in loc.</NOTE> If we conquer <HI>the rulers and gouernours of the darknesse of this world,</HI> wee shall easily discomfit their followers and instruments.

<P>For the first point: armour is necessarie, whether wee consider our owne weaknesse, or our enemies strength. Our weaknesse, as being vnapt and vnable by nature to
<PB N="162" REF="84">
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 5.</NOTE> thinke so much as a good thought, and therefore we must be <HI>strong through the Lord,</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Lombard.</NOTE> who giueth his souldiers <HI>power and might,</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Psal. 144. 1.</NOTE> teaching our hands to warre, and our fin|gers to fight. It is reported of <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Xiphlin in vita Traiani.</NOTE> <HI>Traian</HI> that he would cut in peeces his owne garments, rather then his souldiers should want a ragge to binde vp their wounds: but our Captaine Christ hath giuen vnto such as march vnder his banner his owne flesh and his owne selfe, willing vs not to put on his armour, but also to <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 14.</NOTE> <HI>put on himselfe,</HI> that we may be <HI>strong through the power of his might,</HI> who can doe whatsoeuer he will, and will doe whatsoeuer is best for all his followers. Againe, we need armes in respect of our enemies, as being many, mightie, cunning in plotting, cruell in executing.</P>
<P>1. Many, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Kilius.</NOTE> for these gouernours and princes haue ma|ny souldiers and subiects vnder them, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Aretius.</NOTE> <HI>improbos spiritus, &amp; homines pessimos,</HI> an <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Ecclesiastes 1. 15.</NOTE> infinite number, against a little flocke and an handfull of people.</P>
<P>2. Mightie, <HI>for we wrastle not against flesh and blood,</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">chius.</NOTE> that is, not simply with flesh and blood; or <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Lombard. Aquin.</NOTE> onely, for then <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Marlorat.</NOTE> one sword should be so long as another, and one man so strong as another: but we fight men against di|uels, euen weaklings against powers and principalities, as it were sillie lambes against roring lions.</P>
<P>3. Cunning in plotting, as being <HI>spirituall</HI> and invisi|ble, fighting so <HI>craftily,</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Anselme.</NOTE> that we know not on which side they will assault. Satan in the beginning was a <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 1.</NOTE> Ser|pent for his subtiltie, but now being indued with almost six thousand yeeres experience, become a Dragon and an old Serpent, Apocal. 20. 2. <HI>Cui nomina mille, mille no|cendi artes,</HI> quoth <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Ad Heli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">dor. de vita <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> <HI>Hierome.</HI> Such a <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 11.</NOTE> circumuenting enemie, that being a prince of darknes, he can <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 14.</NOTE> transforme himselfe into an angell of light. Auarice is a worke of darknesse, peeuishnesse a worke of darknesse, inordinate drinking a worke of darknes. But he doth couer and cloak these with armour of light, insinuating, that couetousnesse is commendable thrift, obstinacie noble resolution, and
<PB N="163" REF="84">
drunkennesse a point of good fellowship. Grosse wicked|nesse is easily seene, and preuented soone: but our chiefe aduersaries abound with <HI>spirituall wickednesse and inuisible craftinesses,</HI> and their ordinary souldiers are in their gene|ration <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Luke 16. 8.</NOTE> wiser then the children of light.</P>
<P>4. Cruell in executing and prosecuting; Sathan is an <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Apoc. 12. 10.</NOTE> accuser of his brethren, and a <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Iohn 8. 44.</NOTE> murtherer from the be|ginning, called in holy Scripture a Lyon for his might, and a roring Lyon for his malice, seeking daily whom he may deuoure, 1.

For seeing our enemies are <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Augustin de Ciuit. l. 8. c. 22.</NOTE> <HI>superbia tumids, inuidentia liuids, fallacia callidi, &agrave; iustitia penitus alieni,</HI> so many, so mighty, so malitious, so crafty, so willing and able to hurt vs, it behoueth euery man to be well appointed and armed, <HI>that he may be able to resist in the euill day.</HI></P>
<P>The second point obserued in the Proclamation, is, that our armour must be <HI>Gods armour,</HI> not armour of the flesh, <HI>for</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ierem. 17. 5.</NOTE> <HI>cursed is the man that maketh flesh his arme.</HI> Not ar|mour of the world, for our enemies are <HI>worldly gouernours,</HI> and the chiefe of them is <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Iohn 12. 31</NOTE> <HI>the Prince of the world.</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psal. 20. 7.</NOTE> Some put their trust in Chariots, and other in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. Not ar|mour of the diuell, for then we shall haue nothing but his leauings. His armour is Popish exorcisme, superstitious crossing, holy water and the like: which he little feareth as being framed in his owne shop, and giuen vs at his ap|pointment. <HI>The weapons of our warfare are not</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 4.</NOTE> <HI>carnall, but mighty through God to cast downe holds.</HI> Against spiri|tuall harmes we must vse <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Primasius.</NOTE> spirituall armes; against the workes of darknesse we must <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 12.</NOTE> <HI>put on armour of light,</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Aquin.</NOTE> that is, vertues against vices, as being <HI>vestimenta</HI> put on, <HI>munimenta</HI> armour, <HI>ornamenta</HI> of light. Let vs then if the diuell at any time tempt to cruelty, pride, impatience; <HI>put on</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Coloss. 3. 12.</NOTE> <HI>tender mercy, kindnes, humblenes of minde, meeknesse, long suffering,</HI> &amp;c. as it is in the present Epistle, wee must

arme our selues with the <HI>breast-plate of righteousnes</HI> against iniquity, <HI>with the girdle of truth</HI> against heresie, <HI>with the helmet of saluation</HI> against dispaire, <HI>with the shield of faith</HI> against infidelity. The diuell is mysticallie that huge Le|uiathan <HI>esteeming</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Iob. 41.</NOTE> <HI>iron as straw, and brasse as rottenwood, when the sword doth touch him he will not rise vp and he laugh|eth at the shaking of the speare, in the earth there is none like him,</HI> he feares not our fleshly weapons, or worldly wea|pons, and therefore that we may stand against his force, we must put on the armour of God, and dwell vnder the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Psal. 91. 1.</NOTE> defence of the most high.</P>
<P>The third thing considered in the proclamation, is, that we put on <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Sarcerius. B. Latymer. Mariorat.</NOTE> <HI>all</HI> Gods armour, or <HI>the whole armour</HI> of God, as it is verse 13. If we should arme our head onely, the diuell happily would strike at the foote: if the foote only, then he might hurt our head: if both, and leaue our breast vnarmed, he might wound vs at the heart. Where|fore that we may repell all assaults of the diuell, we must <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Aretius.</NOTE> <HI>tanquam milites cataphracti,</HI> put on all the armour of God. I cannot examine euery particular weapon in this Armourie, learne onely three points of warre in the whole.</P>
<P>First, that <HI>Paul</HI> heere makes no mention of a backe Cu|rete for the Christian souldier.

<P>The second remarkable point of warre is, that we must aboue all other weapons of defence take <HI>the shield of faith.</HI> And the reason heereof is plaine, because the helmet co|uers only the head, the corselet the breast, and the sandall the foote: but a <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Zanchius.</NOTE> shield couers all the body. Let vs then <HI>aboue all,</HI> or as <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Vulgar Latin.</NOTE> other read <HI>in all,</HI> vse faith. In <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Anselm.</NOTE> all tenta|tions and combats, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Royard, hom. 2. in loc.</NOTE> or in putting on all the weapons aforesaid, haue a liuely faith and assured confidence, without which all the rest haue no force. The sword of the Spirit without faith is no scripture to thee, the girdle of verity without faith is no truth vnto thee, all thy righ|teousnesse without faith is vnrighteousnesse. Seeing then it is impossible without faith either to please God, or resist the diuell, in all, and aboue all vse the shield of faith, wherewith yee may <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Caietan.</NOTE> not onely reiect or auoid: but also <HI>quench</HI> all the tentations of the wicked, albeit they bee <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Caluin.</NOTE> <HI>darts</HI> in respect of their sharpnesse, and <HI>fiery</HI> for their de|stroying, one sinne <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Lombard.

But bee of good cheare, <HI>faith ouer commeth the world,</HI> 1. Iohn 5. 4. One shield of faith is able to beare, yea to beat off all the fierie darts of the wicked world, flesh, and diuell.</P>
<P>The third point of warre is, that the Christian souldier is armed with a sword so well as with a buckler: and this sword is <HI>the word of God,</HI> being <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 12.</NOTE> powerfull in operartion and sharper then any two edged sword. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Viues in Au|gust. lib. 14. de Ciuit. cap. 12.</NOTE> Sharpe in a li|terall,

<P>The last obseruable thing in the proclamation is, that a Christian ought not onely to know Gods armour, but also <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Zanchius.</NOTE> <HI>put it on.</HI> For as it is not enough for the seruice of our Common-weale that wee keepe good weapons at home, or that we shew them at musters abroad, except we haue skill and will (as occasions of the State require) personally to serue with them: euen so, to haue the sword of the Spirit rust at home, or sometime to flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ish a little with it abroad, is not sufficient for the souldier of Christ,
<PB N="167" REF="86">
except he can and will vse Gods armour, and stand in bat|tell against all assaults of the diuell. As in Physicke the best prescript can doe no good except it be taken: so the most complet armour is no defence when as it is not worne. We must in aduersitie put on patience, in prospe|ritie put on humblenesse of minde, at all times <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Coloss. 3. 14.</NOTE> aboue all these put on loue, giuing euery man his owne. If we will ouercome the princes of darknesse, wee must put on the armour of light.</P>
<P>But obserue heere that wee must vse the weapons of God in the warres of God, against enemies of God onely, <HI>that wee may stand against all assaults,</HI> and quench all the fierie darts of the diuell. Many men hit the souldiers of Christ, and hurt the friends of God with armour of God. As Heretikes fraudulently cite scriptures against scrip|tures, and Fathers against Fathers, and so make God as it were fight against himselfe. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Velleiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> hist. lib. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Silla</HI> said, <HI>ante frangendus ho|stis qu&agrave;m vlciscendus ciuis,</HI> our force must not bee spent in priuate grudges against our brethren, but in the publike quarrell of the Gospell against the common enemie.

O Lord <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Psal. 19. 12.</NOTE> <HI>who can tell how oft he offendeth?

<P><PB N="181" REF="93">The next point to be considered is the partie to whom our blessed Sauiour spake this, and that is <HI>Peter. Iesus said vnto him, I say to thee,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Petrus hic gerit personam ecclesiae.

Here then all Pastours are taught not to discomfort and despise the poore penitent soule: but rather to pro|nounce Gods pardon and absolution as often as hee truly repents and vnfainedly beleeues his holy Gospell. It was an heresie defended by <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Hieron. lib. 2. adversus Iouin.</NOTE> <HI>Montanus,</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Alphonsus de Castro Tit. pae|niten. haeres. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Nouatus,</HI> and <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>August. hae|res.</HI> 48. <HI>&amp; Epi|phan haeres.</HI> 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> <HI>Me|letius,</HI> that such as after baptisme and solemne repentance fell into relapse, and committed any grieuous crime, as adulterie, sacrilege, murther and the like, ought not to be receiued againe into the bosome of the Church.

<P>And this may be construed of the Churches absoluti|on, so most expound it of mutuall forgiuenesse in priuate between brother &amp; brother.

In not forgiuing we wrong God, to whom <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 30.</NOTE> vengeance belongeth: our neighbours, in that our priuate <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Philip. 2. 3.</NOTE> quarrels often hinder the publike peace of the Church: our selues, hereby neglecting o|ther businesse of importance, yea the greatest of all our owne soules eternall estate, for <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Matth. 6. 14.</NOTE> except we forgiue other,
<PB N="182" REF="94">
God will not forgiue vs, as Christ sheweth in the conclu|sion of his ensuing parable.</P>
<P>Yea but is it vnlawfull to defend our selues against the violent hands and virulent tongues of such as iniurie vs in our goods and good name? No. When a brother offen|deth in this kind, <HI>Corripiamus verbis &amp; si opus est verbe|ribus,</HI> quoth <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Serm. 15. de verbis Domini.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine.</HI> As euery Christian must bee tender of his conscience in regard of himselfe, so <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Melanct. po|stil. in loc.</NOTE> iea|lous of his credit in regard of other. We may therefore sue the slanderer euen for the Gospels glorie, lest good men be scandalized, and God himselfe blasphemed vpon any false report spread abroad of vs. Indeed the seditious <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> and <HI>Iulian</HI> that scoffing <HI>Apostata</HI> say, that this and other like places of holy scripture disanull the Magistrates authoritie.

<P>This <HI>Iairus</HI> was a ruler of a <HI>Synagogue.</HI> Now that yee may the better vnderstand what office this was, I must informe you, that there was in all Iewry but one Temple, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Deut. 16.</NOTE> where the people were commanded to celebrate their

Where by the way note, that vniformity in discipline is an hedge to vnitie and doctrine. Where Canons and Iniunctions of order are despised, and euery man left vnto himselfe: There many times are so many sects as Cities, and almost <HI>as many Gospels as gossips.</HI> On the contrary, when all things in the Church are done <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 40.</NOTE> orderly, when the Chri|stian Magistrate enioies in outward ceremonies one kinde of discipline for the publike worship of God: there for the most part, an vnion in law breeds an vnion in loue, a conformity in fashion an vniformity in faith, <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 4. 3. 15.</NOTE> en|deuouring to keepe the vnity of the spirit in the bond of peace, following the truth in loue.

<HI>Iairus the ruler of the Synagogue.</HI> If hee bee fit, I say, for when a man is out of his proper calling in any socie|ty, it is as much as if a ioint were dislocated in the body. To make thy sonne a trades-man, if hee bee most apt for learning; or to send him to the Court, when hee is fitter for the Cart: is as much as if a man should applie his toes to feeling and not his fingers, and to walke on his hands and not on his feet. It was a memorable fact of that fa|mous Bishop&punc; of <HI>Lincolne, Robert Grosthead,</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Sir George Paul in the life of Archbishop Whitgift. p. 85.</NOTE> who being vpon a time solicited to preferre his poore kinsman, and thereupon enquiring what condition of life hee follow|ed, and vnderstanding that he was an husbandman: <HI>Why then</HI> (answered he) <HI>if his plough be broken, I will repaire it, or rather then faile bestow a new vpon him, whereby hee may go on in his course: but so to dignifie him, as to make him for|sake his calling and trade wherein he was brought vp, I meane not to doe.</HI></P>
<P>Now that a father may the better accommodate his child with a fit calling: hee <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">See Perkins treatise of Cal|lings.</NOTE> must obserue both his in|clination and naturall gifts.

And it is not amisse for Christians to follow Heathens in this, or any like commendable pra|ctise.</P>
<P>Secondly, parents must obserue the naturall endow|ments of their children, applying such as excell in emi|nent gifts of the minde vnto courses of learning: and o|ther which excell in gifts of the body to trades and me|chanicall occupations. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Magdeburg.

And because many parents are ignorant, and most parents ex|ceeding partiall in iudging of their owne childrens incli|nation and ingenuity: the best way for them is to be dire|cted heerin by some iudicious friends, and then out of ma|ture iudgement, to giue vnto Caesar, the things appertai|ning to Caesar, accommodating such vnto secular courses as are most apt for the Common-wealth: and vnto God the things which belong to God, committing them vnto <HI>Iairus,</HI> and consecrating them vnto the sacred function of the Ministerie.</P>
<P>That <HI>Iairus</HI> was a ruler of the Synagogue in Caper|naum, is insinuated Luke 8. 41. and in the first verse of this present chapter of our Euangelist, as I haue copiously prooued in the beginning of mine Exposition, Gospell Sunday 19. after Trinity. Capernaum then had a good <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Melanct. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m. in loc.</NOTE> Pastour, and as we read, Matth. 8. 5. a good Captaine, and Christ the best of all often resided in that Citie: yet notwithstanding (as truth it selfe <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Matth. 11. 23</NOTE> witnesseth) it was a very wicked and dissolute place, deseruing greater dam|nation in the day of iudgement than the land of Sodome and Gomorrah. Let not then any vigilant Minister, or di|ligent Magistrate bee discouraged in his place, for that his people bring not foorth any fruits of righteousnesse answerable to the meanes of their instruction: for <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Ezech. 3. 19.</NOTE> <HI>if thou warne the wicked, and he turne not from his wickednesse, nor from his wicked way, hee shall die in his iniquity: but</HI>

<P>Hauing thus examined the fashion of the ruler, it re|maines I should treat of his faith, and fruit thereof also. But for as much as I haue spoken of these vertues in the woman afflicted with the bloody flux, and other like pe|titioners vnto Christ often elsewhere: I thinke that I haue a <HI>Supersedeas</HI> out of the Chancery to meddle no more with him at this time, and a <HI>Capias corpus</HI> as it were, for his deceased daughter.
