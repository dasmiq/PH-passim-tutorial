<P>This is a happy aduancement, that the <HI>daughter of Sion</HI> is made the <HI>daughter</HI> of God; whom his equall and eternal <HI>sonne</HI> hath vouchsafed to marry. It was no smal preferment in <HI>Dauids</HI> o~pinion, by wedding <HI>Saules</HI> daughter, to bee made <HI>sonne in Law to a King</HI>: how farre higher doth the <HI>Churches</HI> honour transcend, that by marrying the sonne of God, is made <HI>daughter in Law</HI> to the King of Kinges? Specially, when this bond is indissoluble by the hand of death; vncancellable by the sentence of man, vndiuor|ceable by any defect or default in the <HI>Spouse</HI>: for hee that chose her to himselfe, will preserue her from all cause, why hee may not <HI>take pleasure in her beauty.</HI> And as <HI>Christ</HI> now in heauen, dwels with his <HI>Church</HI> on earth by grace: so <HI>shee,</HI> though partly now on earth, dwels with him in heauen; all her members being Burgesses of that celesti|all Corporation.

As Christ hath sent thee downe his <HI>spirit,</HI> as a pawne and pledge of this assurance: so doe thou send him vp thy heart, for a token of thy accep|tance: yea of thy hopefull expectation and desire to bee with him: <HI>Minus anima promisit se Christo, quae non praemisit se Christo</HI>: that soule hath nothing lesse then vowed it selfe to Christ, that houers and hankers about the world, and is loath to come at him.</P>
<P>This is ineffable, inestimable happines.

Mariage is a strong bond by Gods ordinance, and knowes no other methode but com|position. God, that increation made two of one, by mar|riage made one of two. Hence the <HI>Daughter of Israell</HI> is made one with the <HI>sonne</HI> of God; by an vnion, which the heart may feele, but no art describe. Those gracious and glorious riches, which the master of all the world, is pro|prietarie of, are in some sort communicate toys.

Raging famine is the prime companion of many fellow|mischiefes. <HI>Ex vno grano oritur aceruus</HI>: of one graine of this staruing misery, ariseth a whole heape of lamentable woes. The attendants of famine are murthers, robberies, rapes, killing of children, that the same vessels become the wombes and toombs of little ones; and innumerable stretchings of conscience, to the reuoking of former, and prouoking of future iudgements. No maruell if hunger disregard the mounds and fences of Gods laws and mans, when it breakes through stone walls. The Poet, somwhat morally describes Famine.

<P>Why is not the health of the daughter of my people re|couered?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_WE haue described the <HI>Person,</HI> the Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> as she is her own, as shee is her owners: what in re|garde of her selfe, what in respect of her God. It remaines now on|ly to enquire, how shee is affected. Shee is <HI>Sicke</HI>; which is necessarily implied from Gods complaint. <HI>Why is not the health of my daughter reco|uered?</HI> She was <HI>sicke,</HI> and so sicke, that the <HI>Prophet</HI> com|plaines, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Micah. 1.9.</NOTE> <HI>Her wound is incurable, for it is come</HI> (euen to the heart) <HI>vnto Iudah. Incurable,</HI> in regard of her owne misery, not of her Sauiours mercy. She was low brought in the <HI>Babilonish Captiuity.</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Esay. 1.9.</NOTE> <HI>Except the Lord of hostes had
<PB N="54" REF="29">
left vnto vs a very small remnant, wee should haue beene as Sodome,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Lam. 3.22.</NOTE> and like vnto Gomorrah? It is of the Lords mercies, that wee are not consumed, because his compassions</HI> (though our obedience) <HI>faile not.</HI> But her <HI>honour lay in the dust,</HI> when her Apostacie had forfeited her happinesse: <HI>Superstition</HI> taking the vpper hand of <HI>Deuotion,</HI> and the <HI>traditions</HI> of man getting the start and ascendency of Gods <HI>precepts</HI>; When her disease grew too frenzy, and her <HI>sicknesse</HI> so excluding from it selfe all recouerable hope, that shee had slaine her Physitian, and killed him that should haue carried her.</P>
<P>Whence it appeares, that a particular visible <HI>Church</HI> might and may fall away from grace, and haue the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Reuel. 2.5.</NOTE> <HI>Can|dlesticke remooued.</HI> The <HI>Papists</HI> bragge of their numerous multitude, and promontorious celsitude. <HI>Rome</HI> boasts that their <HI>Church</HI> stands vpon an <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Nath. 5, 14</NOTE> <HI>hill.</HI> So it doth on <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Reuel. 17.9</NOTE> <HI>six hilles</HI> too many.

There may be a locall succession, but if not in faith and doctrine, <HI>mole ruit sua,</HI> her toppe-heauy weight ouerthrowes her.

<P>I will not descend into the view of her apostacie, though iust occasion may seeme heere offred; but turne my selfe and speech to our selues, who are <HI>sound</HI> in doctrine, <HI>sicke</HI> in conversation; but (I trust) not without good hope of recouerie.</P>
<P>But so soone as the <HI>Romish</HI> malignancie heares me say, <HI>wee are sicke</HI>; they instantly insult, reproching our do|ctrine. But doe <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Tertul.</NOTE> <HI>men try the faith by the persons, or the per|sons by the faith?</HI> It is a silly argument <HI>(&agrave; moribus ad doctri|nam)</HI> from the life to the doctrine. Yet (though we desire
<PB N="55" REF="29">
and striue to haue our owne liues better) we feare not to match them with theirs. Our <HI>sicknesse</HI> would be esteemed lesse, if we would goe to <HI>Rome</HI> for a medicine. (For the Papist may better steale the horse, than the Protestant looke on.) But so long as we haue approoued Phisitions at home, what need we walke so farre to a Mountebanke? It is a false rumour, there is no sound ayre but the Romish. Is it not rather true, that thence comes all infection? And that they who haue forsaken vs to seeke health there, haue gone out of Gods blessing into the warme Sunne?</P>
<P>Our liues trouble them: this they obiect, this they ex|probrate <HI>ad nauseam vsque.</HI> But do they not stumble at our strawes, and leape ouer their owne blockes? cauill at our motes, and forget (or iustifie) their owne beames? The swelling on the Foxes head shall be a horne, if the Pope will so iudge it: a <HI>Catiline, Lopus, Garnet, Faulx,</HI> an honest man, a Catholike, a Saint, if hee will so interpret, so cano|nize him. If I should but pricke this ranke vein, how would <HI>Rome</HI> bleed?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>i Ia vita Aug.</HI></NOTE> Would not (<HI>haec prodidisse, be vicisse,</HI> as <HI>Eras|mus</HI> said of <HI>Augustines</HI> dealing against the <HI>Maniches</HI>) the very demonstration of these things, be a sufficient conuic|tion? Vnnaturall and hideous treasons, conspiracies a|gainst whole kingdomes, deposing, dethroning, touching with a murderous hand (<HI>Christos Dei</HI>) the <HI>Annointed</HI> of God; oathes, vncleannesses, periuries from whom are they produced, by whom practised, if not mostly, if not onely by Papists? They prie, search, deride, censure the forepart of their Wallet, wherein they put our iniquities: whiles their owne sinnes are ready to breake their neckes behinde them. The greatest euils wee haue are theirs; fa|ther'd by those that will not be mother'd of our Church: <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug. d. vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Eccles. cap.</HI> 16</NOTE> <HI>Haec non ad frument a Christi, sed ad eorum paleam pertinent:</HI> These belong not to Christs <HI>wheate,</HI> but to the <HI>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffe</HI> of Antichrist.

<P><PB N="56" REF="30"><HI>Si quid in his possem, facerem sterilescere matrem</HI>; as one of their owne said. It were well, if either the children would forsake their kind or the mother become barren: Yet must these men be <HI>Saints,</HI> and stand named with red letters, in the Popes Calendar; red indeed, so dyed with the Martyr'd bloud of Gods seruants.</P>
<P>But I am not delighted to stand vpon comparisons, if their exclamations had not put me to them, that like blown Pharisies, they cry out with ostentation of sanctity, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Luk. 18.11</NOTE> <HI>God, I thanke thee, that I am not as other men are, or as this Pub|lican,</HI> What age, people, Church were euer yet so holy, that the <HI>Preachers</HI> found no cause of reproofe, of com|plaint against it? <HI>Chrysostome</HI> speaketh of his times: <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>In oper. imp.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Chri|stians now are become like Pagans or worse</HI>: Yet who will say that the Religion of Pagans was better then the Christi|ans.

<P>I deny not, that wee haue grieuous offenders: wee mourne and pray for them. Doe the Papists reioyce at this? Woe to him that is glad of Gods dishonour. Let them brag their peruersion of some which were ours, but such and so affected to viciousnesse. If wee had lost more of Atheists, sacrileg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous Adulterers, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">centious hypocrites we had as little reason to complaine, as they to be proud.

<P><HI>Sicknesse</HI> is the Subiect, and the obseruations that shal limite my short ensuing speech, are quadruple. 1. The pre|cious benefite of <HI>spirituall health,</HI> which we shall the better discerne, if wee compare it with corporall, 2. What <HI>sicke|nesse</HI> is incident to man, 3. That the <HI>Sickenesse</HI> of the <HI>Soule</HI> is most dangerous, 4. Lastly, who are the <HI>sicke</HI>?</P>

It is one of the positiue vertues, grafted in mans nature with the creation. Weigh it in the ballance with some riuals.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Riches</HI> are the desire of many hearts, the speciall fruit which their hands reach to gather (passing by all the bet|ter trees in Gods orchard) the obiect of most endeuours: How vaine, how tedious, how odious are they without health?

Health giues meanes to bee rich, riches giue no meanes to be healthfull.

The day would not seeme so cleare, if the de|parting Sunne should not leaue night to follow it. The foile addes grace to the Iewell.

<P>There is a twofolde <HI>Sicknesse</HI> incident to man, 1. in <HI>sinne,</HI> 2. for <HI>sinne.</HI> The former of these is only spiritual: the latter is not onely corporall, but sometimes spirituall also: and of all the Vials of Gods wrath, holden to the mouth of miserable men by the hand of iustice, it is the forest, when sinne shall bee punished with sinne, and the

<P N="1">1 The <HI>Sicknesse</HI> in sinne is double, according to the cause, which is a defect either of right belieuing, or straight liuing, a debility of confidence, a sterility of good works: lacke of faith, wracke of charity. These effects (or rather defects) are produced by two errors in our <HI>Soules</HI> diet: the one excessiue, the other deficient, 1. By <HI>Fasting</HI> too much from <HI>Christ,</HI> 2. By <HI>feeding</HI> too much on the world. In what wee should affect, we are abstinent, in what auoide, very indulgent.</P>
<P N="1">1 The first cause is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6.</NOTE> by forbearing that sacred meat, li|uing and life giuing <HI>bread,</HI> which <HI>came downe from heauen,</HI> to translate thither those that eate it.

<P N="2">2 The <HI>excessiue</HI> occasion to procure ill <HI>health</HI> to our soules, is by feeding too heartily too hastily on the world. This is that too much oyle, which quencheth our Lampe.

<P N="2">2 <HI>Spirituall sickenesse for sinne</HI> in the reprobate hath o|ther effects. To restraine their number, they principall appeare in two diseases, or disasters rather, <HI>Impenitency</HI> and <HI>Despaire.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Impenitencie,</HI> the symptome of an obdurate and re|morselesse heart. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Eph. 4.19</NOTE> <HI>Who being past feeling, haue giuen them|selues ouer vnto lasciuiousnes, to worke all vncleannesse with gre|dinesse.</HI> Saint <HI>Paul</HI> cals it a <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Rom. 1.28.</NOTE> <HI>reprobate minde</HI>: a death rather then a sickenesse. He that labours hereof, is rather decea|sed, then diseased. This is a heart so hard and impenetra|ble, that all the holy dewes of instructions cannot soften it; all the blowes of Gods striking rod put no sense into it. It is inuulnerable to any stroke, saue that which makes a fatall and finall end with it. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Ier. 5.3.</NOTE> <HI>Thou hast stricken them, but they haue not grieued,</HI> &amp;c. It is iust with God, but fearefull on whom soeuer this iu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gement lights, to plague sin with sinne, that <HI>peccatum sit paena peccantis.</HI> For there is euermore some precedent impietie in those vngratious persons, pro|curing God to deale thus with them. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">2 Thes. 2.11 12.</NOTE> <HI>For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should beleeue a lie.

obduracy.</P>
<P>This is that retaliation of sinne, which God returnes into their bosomes that foster it, that since <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psal. 109.17.</NOTE> <HI>they loued cur|sing, it shall be vnto them.</HI> So <HI>Dauid</HI> in the <HI>Psalme.</HI> (Though indeed it was not in him <HI>Precantis votum,</HI> but <HI>Prophetantis vaticinium</HI>: he did not desire it should be so, but he knew it would be so.) <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psal. 69.27.</NOTE> <HI>Adde iniquitieto their iniquitie.</HI> Neither doth God this by infusion of wickednesse, but by substra|ction of his <HI>spirit.</HI> He is <HI>causa deficiens,</HI> not <HI>efficiens</HI>; as the reuoking of the <HI>sunne</HI> from vs causeth darkenesse: the pri|uation of grace, the position of all vngodlines. It is in him (not <HI>peccatum, sed iudicium</HI>) not sinne, but iudgement. When he leaues vs to our selues; it is no wonder if we fall into horrid and prodigious sinnes. <HI>Peccatum est malum in se: effectum prioris mali, &amp; causa subsequentis: est &amp; supplici|um, &amp; causa supplicij.</HI> Sinne is <HI>euill</HI> in it selfe, the effect of former <HI>euill,</HI> the cause of future&punc; It is both punishment it selfe, and the cause of punishment. In all the store house of Gods plagues there is not a greater vengance. With o|ther punishments the <HI>body</HI> smarteth, the <HI>soule</HI> groneth vn|der this. Hence sinnes multiply without limits, that the plagues may be without end. Euery affliction is sore that offends vs; but that is direfull which withall offends God. Such do at once act and suffer: it is both an actiue and a passiue sinne. The punishment they suffer, is (in them) sinne; the sinne they doe, is (from God) a punishment.</P>
<P>There is nothing more wretched, then a wretched man recking his owne wretchednesse. Eyther they do not feele as blockes, or they will not feele as <HI>Stoickes.</HI> You know <HI>a seared conscience</HI> is not sensible: and vsuall whipping makes some carelesse of the rodde; except it bee a stroke that shall fetch bloud of the <HI>soule.</HI> Indeed we are all of one mould, but some are more cloddy and hard, others more soft and relenting. The best in their <HI>sorrowes,</HI> may be more then <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Miserius nihil est miserose non miserante.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Conquerors,</HI> not more then men. And let the Stoicke bragge his tetricall conclusions to the world, that
<PB N="85" REF="44">
<HI>no paine can bring sorrow to a Wise man; &amp;c..</HI> Let him (being put into that torturous engine of burning brasse, called the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>In Equaleo.</HI></NOTE> Horse) bite in his anguish; smother his grones, sigh in|wardly, and cry to the Spectators, <HI>non sentio,</HI> I feele not. The wicked may laugh out lighter punishments; and like the surde deafe, and dead rockes of the sea, not regarde the waues of easier iudgements beating on them; letting fall no teares of repentance for so many blowes. But when God sees that thou digestest his Physicke as dyet, and with a strange kinde of indulgencie, wilt neither grieue that thou hast offended, nor that thou art offended: God will strike home, and sharpen at once both his blow &amp; thy sense. Now thou shalt <HI>feele</HI>; euen thy <HI>seared heart</HI> shall bleed. In a word, the wicked may be senseles Stoicks, they cannot be insensible stones. There is in all men an impossi|bility of impassibility.</P>
<P>But these remorseles wretches, so <HI>spiritually sicke</HI> (not of the stone in the raines, but) in the heart, at least re|garde not to offend God, whiles God forbeares to offend them. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Psal. 73.9.</NOTE> <HI>They speake softly, they set their mouth a|gainst the heauens.</HI> The reason is, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Ver. 5</NOTE> <HI>They are not in trou|ble, nor plagued as other men.</HI> At first they liberally sinne and spare not: God lets them alone. loe, now they sinne and care not. Impiety, impunity, impenitency thus swift|ly follow one at the heeles of another. There are some <HI>sicke</HI> of this disease, but not so far gone; of whose recouery there is a little (&amp; but a little) more hope. These haue by the chi|dings of their accusing <HI>conscience,</HI> a notion, a rellish, a ghesse of the number and nature of their own sins, which because they suspect to be monstrous, they would by no means ad|mit a sight of. Hence they flie the temple, the society of the good, the voice of exhortation, whence soeuer it soundeth: lest it should call the <HI>Soules</HI> eye home, to glance at the own estate, and so leaue it amazed. Hence he hath (<HI>animum in|scium, inscitum</HI>) an ill sight, an ill-sighted mind.</P>
<P>So timorous is this Patient, that because he knows his
<PB N="86" REF="45">
wound deepe, he will not suffer the Chirurgion to search it, willing rather to kill his soule, then to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">isquiet it. Such is the folly of his partiall indulgence to his conscience, that whiles hee would softer it, he doth fester it. They write of the Elephant, that (as if guilty of his owne defor|mity, and therfore not abiding to view his snowt in a cleare spring:) he seekes about for troubled and muddy waters to drinke in, This <HI>sicke</HI> wretch (without question induced by the like reason) refuseth to looke into the <HI>glasse</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> or to come to the cleare <HI>springs</HI> of the <HI>Gospell,</HI> or any perspectiue that may represent his euill conscience to his eyes, but seekes to muddy and polluted channels, Tauerns, Theaters, societies of sinne, to drowne the thought of former iniquities with floudes of new. (And if he be en|forced to any such reflection, hee spurnes and tramples that admonition, as Apes breake the glasse that repre|sents their deformity, He runs himselfe prodigally into so deepe arrerages and debts, that hee cannot endure to heare of a reckoning. Whiles he despaires of sufficiency to pay the old, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e reckes not into what new desperate courses and curses he precipitates himselfe. And as it was in the Fable with the blind woman and the Physitian: the Physitian comming often to her house, euer carried away a portion of her best goods; so that at last recouered, by that time her sight was come againe, her goods were gone. So this wretch will not see the ransacking of his soule, and spoile of his graces, till his conscience be left empty, and then hee sees, and cries too late, as <HI>Esau</HI> for his <HI>blessing.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 That other <HI>spirituall sicknesse for sinne,</HI> befalling a re|probate soule, is finall and totall desperation. This is that fearefull consequent, which treades vpon the heeles of the former <HI>sicknesse. Presumption</HI> goes before, <HI>Despaire</HI> followes after. <HI>Cains</HI> fratricide, <HI>Iudas</HI> treacherie, presump|tuous, aspiring, heauen-daring sinnes, find this desperate catastrophe, to cut themselues off from the mercy of

God. This is <HI>insanabilis plaga,</HI> when the Physitian promi|sing helpe of the disease, the patient shall thrust <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is nayles into it, and cry, <HI>Nay, it shall not be healed.</HI> As if the goodnes of God, and the value of <HI>Christs-all sufficient</HI> ransom, were below his iniquity. As if the pardon of his sinnes would empty Gods storehouse of compassion, and leaue his stocke of mercy poore. This is that <HI>agony,</HI> whose throbs and throwes, restles, turbulent, implacable cogitations cannot be quieted. Let riuers of those <HI>waters</HI> of comfort, which <HI>glad the City of God,</HI> run with full streames vnto it, they are resisted and driuen backe.</P>
<P>This is that <HI>sinne,</HI> which not onely offers iniury and in|dignity to the Lord of heauen and earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Flagitium per|peirare mors animae, veniam de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perare est au ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m des|cendere.</HI></NOTE> but euen breakes that league of kindnes, which wee owe to our owne flesh. <HI>To commit sinne is the killing of the soule, to refuse hope of mer|cy, is to cast it downe into hell.</HI> Therefore Saint <HI>Ierom</HI> affirms that <HI>Iudas</HI> sinned more in despairing of his masters par|don, then in betraying him.

<P>Shall the <HI>bloud</HI> and <HI>death</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> put sense into rockes and stones, and shall man tread it vnder his desperate feet, eneruate his cross<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, annihilate his ransome, and die past hope? did he raise three <HI>dead</HI> men to life, one newly depar|ted, an other on the Beare, a third swelling, in the graue: to manifest that no dgree of death is so desperate, that it is past his recouery?

<P>The <HI>Soule</HI> is; at all parts, more precious then the <HI>Body.</HI> It is that principall, most diuine, and excellent halfe of man. <HI>Dum viuisicat, anima: dum vult, animus, dum scit, mens: dum recolit, memoria, dum iudicat ratio, dum spirat spiritus: dum sentit sensus.</HI> It is called for quickning, a soule, for know|ing, mind, for remembring, memory, for iudging, reason, for breathing, spirit, for feeling, sense, when the <HI>soule</HI> is <HI>sicke</HI>: all these are <HI>sicke</HI> with it. The <HI>soule</HI> is compared to heauen, the body to earth. The heauen is glorious with Sun, Moon Starres; so the soule with vnderstanding, memory, reason, faith, hope, &amp;c. The body like the earth, whereof it was made, is squallid with lusts.

<P>I yeelde, if in <HI>sicknes</HI> we contract and narrow vp the powers of our soule, and direct them (as our finger) to the griefe of our <HI>bodies</HI> only; forgetting either that God strikes vs, or that we haue first stricken God: eyther flying to ill meanes, or affying to good meanes more then to God; our sicknesse may be deadly to <HI>body</HI> and <HI>soule</HI> too. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2.

<P>We shall finde the perplexity of this spirituall <HI>sicknesse</HI>; (how far?) exceeding the <HI>corporall,</HI> if wee either compare them generally, or particularly, instance in any speciall disease.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Generally,</HI> The excellency of <HI>health,</HI> is measured ac|cording to the Life, which holds it: and the dignity of <HI>Life</HI> is considered by the cause that giues it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vita vegetabi|lis.</HI></NOTE> 1.

These two last sorts of <HI>Life</HI> transcend the former in two maine respects, 1. Because the other may die, must die; these haue a patent of eternity sealed them, 2. Because the other haue transient

causes: These haue the <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of God.</P>
<P>Now as by all consent, the <HI>Life</HI> of reasonable man is better then the vegetable of plants, or sensitiue of beasts; so the <HI>health</HI> of man must needes be more preci|ous: and as that vertue excels in goodnesse, so doth the defect exceede in miserablenesse. Respect man distinctiu|ly, as hee is a <HI>Body</HI> onely, and then to bee <HI>sicke,</HI> and die are common to him with plants and beastes; and what suffering is there in the one, more then in the other, saue that as the Beast is more sensible of paine then the tree; so man is more apprehensiue then the beast, the bodies of all <HI>returne to the earth.</HI> But man hath a <HI>soule,</HI> wherein his reason is placed; which fainting or sickening through sinne, or the punishment for sinne, there is offe|red a passion and griefe, whereof the other are not ca|pable.

<P N="2">2 <HI>Particularly,</HI> This will best appeare, if wee single out some speciall disease, and conferre the perplexity it can offer to the body, with the <HI>sickenesse</HI> of the <HI>soule.</HI> Take for instance, the plague of the <HI>Leprosie.</HI> It was a fearefull and vnsupportable <HI>sicknesse,</HI> euery way miserable, as you may finde it described, Leuit. 13. &amp;c. ver. 45.46. <HI>His cloathes shall bee rent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leu. e. 23.14</NOTE><HI> and his head bare, and hee shall put a couering vpon his vpper lippe, and shall cry, Vncleane, vncleane.

<P N="4">4 The <HI>Leaprosie</HI> was a dangerous disease, yet curable by naturall meanes: but ours is by so much the worse, as it admits not man as Physitian, nor nature it se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe as Physicke, sufficient to cure it.

<P N="5">5 The <HI>Leaprosie</HI> is a sore disease, so entring and ea|ting, that it is euen incorporate to the flesh: yet still (<HI>cum carne exuitur</HI>) it is put off with the flesh.
