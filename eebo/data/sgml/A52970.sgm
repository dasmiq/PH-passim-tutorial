<HEAD>NEW
PROPOSITIONS,
PROPOUNDED
At the Kings Royall Court at Holm|by,
betwixt the Kings most Excellent Majesty,
and Mr. Marshall, and Mr. Caryll.</HEAD>
<P>THe Parliament of Scotland have sate
very close, about the disposall of His
Majesties Royall Person, and his fu|ture
Reigne and Government of himselfe
and his Royall Posterity, which indeed is a
thing of high concernment and very much
desired, by his Majesties Subjects within the
Kingdome of England: their hearts relen|ting,
untill the time of expitation, of the
great businesse now in dispence, betweene
<PB N="2" REF="3">
the Soveraigne and the Subject; their eyes
being fully fixed upon this State-Object,
longing to see that happy day of the joyfull
returne of their Gracious Soveraigne, to his
Tribunall Throne at London.</P>
<P>For, the accomplishing of these their long-wished
desires, His Majesties loyall Subjects, (the Parlia|ments
of both Kingdomes) doe likewise endeavour
to bring to a speedy period, and instant of time; if so
be, his gracious Majesty would be pleased, to hear|ken
to the faithfull advice of His two great Coun|cels,
by signing the Propositions, and taking the
Covenant, that so the distractions of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> may be fully composed, and the purity of
Religion firmely established, within His Majesties
Realmes and Dominions.</P>
<P>And to this end, the Estates of <HI>Scotland,</HI> do freely
and unanimously concurre with the Parliament of
<HI>England,</HI> for the humble advising of his Majesty to
condiscend to these their Propositions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. That his Majesty would be plea|sed
(no longer to continue in this adverse
way) but to unite himselfe with them,
and to give his Royall assent for the sig|ning
of the Propositions; that so, all dif|ferences
may be composed within his Ma|jesties
<PB N="3" REF="3">
Realmes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot|land.</HI></P>
<P>2. That his Majestie would be gra|ciously
pleased to unite his Royall heart
with his Subjects of both Kingdomes, by
taking that blessed Covenant, first drawn
up, by the divine will and pleasure of the
great Iehovah, in the highest Throne,
and here confirmed upon Earth, (by his
omnipotent power) for the finishing of his
great Worke; that so the purity and light
of his Gospell, might spring and grow up,
both in the hearts of Prince and People,
and shine in all lustre, throughout the
Realmes of England and Scotland.</P>
<P>3. That his Majesty would be plea|sed
to embrace these their humble and
loyall Desires, by signing the Propositions
and taking the Covenant, His Subjects
of Scotland do declare, that his gracious
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Majesty and his Royall Posterity, should
not suffer in the least, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And for the further effecting of this gallant worke,
no meanes and waies is unsought by the Commissio|ners
of both Kingdomes for the retarding of it, but
doth daily use their utmost endeavours for the attai|ning
of the same, which God grant may be speedily
b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ought to a period.</P>
<P>For, how would his Majesties Loyall Subjects re|joyce,
to heare that tryumphant sound, and melodi|ous
Eccho, of his Majesties concurrence with his
great Councells, by setting his Royall hand to signe
the Propositions, and bending his gracious heart to
receive this faithfull Covenant.</P>

<OPENER><SIGNED>Carolus Rex.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P>SIne I have never dissembled, nor hid my Consci|ence:
And that I am not yet satisfied with the
alteration in Religion, to which ye desire my con|sent.</P>
<P>I will not loose time in giving reasons (which are
too obvious to every body) why it is fit for me to be
attended by some of my Chaplaines, whose opini|ons,
as Clergy-men, I esteeme and reverence. Not
<PB N="5" REF="4">
onely for the exercise of my Conscience, but also for
the cleering of my judgement, concerning the pre|sent
differences in Religion; as I have at full decla|red
to Mr. <HI>Marshall,</HI> and his Fellow-Minister: ha|ving
shewed them that is the best and likeliest means
of giving me satisfaction (which without it I can|not
have) in these things, whereby the distractions of
the Church may be the better se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">led.</P>
<P>Wherefore I desire, that at least two of these re|verend
Divines, whose names I have here set downe,
may have free liberty to wait upon mee, for the dis|charging
of their nuties to mee, according to their
Fuection.</P>

<P>The Kings Majesty is verb desirous to come neere
<PB N="6" REF="5">
London, but yet expresseth himselfe very gallantly
at <HI>Holmby,</HI> and is very familiar with the Commissio|ners
of both Kingdomes, and hath had severall Con|ferences
with the English Divines, about Religion
and the Government of the Church of England, ha|ving
propounded severall Reasons unto them, why
he will not give his Royall assent for the confirming
of the Presbyteriall way, and setling of the Directo|ry:
Desiring likewise to have a Conference with
twelve Learned Divines of the Episcopall Govern|ment,
that so he may be cleered of some points, which
as yet seemeth very strange unto him.</P>
<P>But as Mr. <HI>Marshall</HI> and M. <HI>Caroll</HI> doth use their ut|most
endeavours for the convincing of his Majesty,
and to cleer some scruples about the Directory, which
his Majesty objects against: But within few dayes
wee hope to heare of the happy tydings of his Ma|jesties
Royall assent, to the desire and humble suppli|cation
of his great Councell the Parliaments of both
Kingdomes.</P>
