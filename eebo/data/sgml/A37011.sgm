<HEAD>To the Honourable and my very much esteem'd Friend, Sir <HI>NICHOLAS GARRARD,</HI> Bar. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GReat Courtesies, which are in their value beyond gratifying, grant the re|ceiver this Excuse however; that he may expect a Pardon, if his En|deavour be answerable to his real Will and natural Ability.</P>
<P>I am extreamly Sensible of the many Favours I have had from you, and I am as sensible of the very few ways my ill Stars make me capable of return|ing 'em this little flourish, Sir, is only to Introduce a common Truth, which your Iudgment can inform your self very well without my telling; which is that a Poet has no better way of paying his Gratitude, than by an offering of the Fruits of his Brain, to the generous Person he is oblig'd to.</P>
<P>Sir, if I had not known you to be one that has made it some part of your business as well as diversion, to encourage things of this Nature, I should not have troubled you with this, but the Conversation which for some years I have had the honour to enjoy with you, has given me this boldness, asuring my self, that as you have the same good Humour as formerly, so you have a Gusto and Relish to taste with the same Appetite now, as you did at other times, when I have been so Happy to enter|tain you with the like sort of Treat.</P>
<P>Sir the Comedy I now present to you is in the best Iudgment of my most judicious Friends one of the best of mine, and till I see more and better Matter and Humour in a scription of this kind, I shall not be uneasie when I think on the little poor abuses and disturbances of a malecontented Party, that like the Devil have for some late Years ow'd me an ill turn, and I have reason to fear now will never have done pay|ing me.</P>
<P>The entertainment of Songs and Dances in it, as they gave more diversion than is usually seen in Comedy's, so they were perform'd with general Applause, and I think my Enemies have cause to say with greater than is ordinary; and though this had its Inconve|nience by lenghtning the whole Piece a little beyond the common time of Action, which at this time o'th Year I am sensible is a very great Fault, yet the worst of malice has granted me this, that there appeared no defect of Genius, whatever there might of Iudgment.</P>
<P>The Perusal therefore, Sir, most humbly I commit to yours, and dedicate both my self and it to you, whom I know to be a Man of honour and sence, in which at|tributes, I think all others are comprehended, and since I know your temper too well, to inlarge much upon Complement, or trouble you with impertinent Praise, <HI>I will only think of you as all the sensible World does that know ye,</HI> and make an humble Suit to ye to accept this Trifle as a mark of Gratitude from,</P>

<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Dogget,</HI> with a Fools Cap with Bells on his Head.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>FOols are the Chief Support of Stage Affairs;</L>

<L>For every <HI>John a Nokes</HI> to see his Face.</L>
<L>Had my kind Stars design'd me for a Shop,</L>
<L>Made me some young, pert, lucky, thriving Fop,</L>
<L>I might with Credit all the Town deceive,</L>
<L>And cheat so long till I could fine for Shrieve:</L>
<L>At least in Furrs, the City Livery wear,</L>
<L>And come to eat a Custard with the Mayor.</L>
<L>Or had my Fate, but that's too fine a Thing,</L>
<L>Design'd me some Court Pest to cheat the King,</L>
<L>Conscience would stretch as I had chang'd condition,</L>
<L>I should have made a swinging Politician.</L>
<L>Or had I been some Canting Babe of Grace,</L>
<L>As for the Pulpit I've a lovely Face,</L>
<L>How could I thump the Cushion! With what Zeal</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cunning.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, verily; Fools, half Fools, and such like, are <HI>Cunnington</HI>'s Real Estate; and sometimes I've the luck to have a Wit to provide my Personal. I am a true <HI>Terrae Filius,</HI> and flourish by the Abuse of Mankind, wanting seldom or never Matter to work upon: But if some malignant Planet should reign, whenever you hear that I am out of Fool, you may reasonably conclude too that I am out at Elbows.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little Hardship is a good Whetstone to make Wit sharp; and we poor Fellows, <HI>Ned,</HI> that live by 'em, like Black birds, thrive best in hard Weather: For not being born to Estates for our selves, Fortune has dis|pos'd 'em to others with weaker Brains for us to manage. Now I improve my Talent by Love, Compliance, Insinuation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I love every body, and every body loves me: I oblige all People; I mimick this or that Sot in Company, to humour perhaps one that's a worse himself. I flatter and sing to the Women, to get their Tongues on my side too: And now and then when I am desir'd by some rich Booby that's worth the managing, I can turn my Face into a Changling Grimace, and act like <HI>Solon</HI> in the Play; when, as I hope to be sav'd, I'm all the while bant'ring him, and thinking him the more comical <HI>Solon</HI> of the two, as a Man may say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cunning.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is an artful Method, I confess; but, for my part, if I should practice it, I should starve: For to tell thee the truth, I love no body; nay, what's worse, can hardly counterfeit common Courtesie to the World. The reason is, I hate all People that I think happier than my self: If that Man has a fine Coach, I wish his Horses may founder; if this has a pretty Wife, I wish him a plaguy fit of the Stone, and my self a bed with her: If a third has a rich Cargo in a Ship, or a fourth a deli|cate House, I wish one may be sunk to the bottom, and t'other burnt to the ground.</P>

a Man that's richer than I am, but that's wittier too; and would by my Good-will engross all the Money in the World, and all the Sense too.

<P>Oh, prithee, affront not thy own Abilities: Thou wert a rare Mi|micker at the University, I remember, and I'm sure canst not lose thy Ta|lent so soon: Besides, this is a Doctor for the purpose; Positive, Ignorant, and easie to be impos'd on; one that having a long Worm in his own Pate, solidly believes he can cure it in other Men's. He was first Apothecary of a Physick-Garden; but hapning to cure the Son of a great Statesman that had crack'd his Brains with studying to out-do his Father, in out-witting the <HI>French</HI> Councils, got himself into Money and Reputation, and is now, forsooth, President of the Insanery.</P>

<LG>
<L>Young, yet discreet, without Ill-nature witty,</L>
<L>Rich without Pride, and without Art is pretty.</L>

<P>Besides, I have often, as a Lesson, told thee, That Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> her Father|in-Law and Guardian, being always an inveterate Enemy to our Family; and designing her for his own Son, has forc'd me to this Artifice of thy As|sistance, and that sweet Angel to frustrate all other Pretensions, to act a witty Scene of Lunacy.</P>

<P>Your Brother Sir <HI>Quibble Quere,</HI> you tell me, is to be bubbled too; so that I find I'm to divide my Brains into three several Projects: First, to disappoint the Guardian: Secondly, to banter the Doctor: And, third|ly, to make a meer Ass of your Brother, to pay a friendly Tribute to your Wit.

Besides, he's a Block-head, and I have only hedg'd him into this Bu|siness to stand buff with his Purse upon occasion, and pay the Expence of it. My Mother did me manifest wrong by crossing the strain. Her last Husband, old Sir <HI>Quibble Quere,</HI> was, for above thirty Years together, an old Court-Follower; but of so harmless a Character, that tho' he never bet|ter'd himself, he hindred no one else, being always like a Turn stile, stan|ding in every body's way, and hindering no body. He was also called here, <HI>The Teizer of</HI> Richmond, and would ask you more foolish Questions in a quarter of an Hour, than a hundred wise Men could answer in a Year: And this Brother of mine is his own, by this Light.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guiac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but, Sir, this is a new Case, and I must do it specifically; for she is very obstinate, and will take no Medicines; nor do I resolve to make her Blood ferment, by putting her into a Rage about it, she has Fire enough already; for about the Age of Eighteen the Heat predo|minates extreamly in her Sex; and then, if ever they are infected, they become strongly delirious.</P>

Lord! what a world of sheer Wit too is wasted upon the Vizard-Masks! who return it likewise back in as wonderful a manner. You nuzzle your Noses into their Hoods and Com|modes, just for all the world like the Picture of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Pigeon, when he gave the false Prophet his ghostly Instructions. Fogh how many fine things are said there, perfum'd with the Air of sour Claret! which the well-bred Nymph as odoriferously returns in the scent of <HI>Lambeth-Ale</HI> and <HI>Aqua|vitae</HI></P>

Then supper coming in, the Glasses go about briskly. The Fools think the Wenches heavenly Company, and they tell them they are extream fine Gentlemen; 'till at last few Words are best; the Bargain's made, the Pox is cheaply purchas'd at the price of a Guinea, and no repentance on neither side.
