<P>_THese Poems were given me neer six|teen years since by a Friend of the Authors, with a desire they might be printed, but I conceived the Age then too squeemish to endure the free|dom which the Authour useth; and therefore I hitherto smother'd them, but being desirous they should not perish, and the world be deprived of so much clean Wit and Fancy, I have adventured to expose them to thy view; if they do arride thy Pallat I am glad I gave the occasion; if not, I shall not send thee a Challenge.
