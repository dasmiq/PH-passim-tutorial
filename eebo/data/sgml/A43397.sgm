<HEAD><HI>AN</HI> Elegie upon the death of THOMAS Earle of <HI>Strafford,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of IRELAND.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>_Awake my drowsie Muse, no longer dreame,</L>
<L>But in <HI>Apollo's</HI> Sisters divine streame;</L>
<L>Goe wash thy selfe, swiftly returne againe,</L>
<L>Begging <HI>Melpomene,</HI> her Tragick straine,</L>
<L>Noe <HI>Epithaliums,</HI> I intend to write,</L>
<L>Nor will I Comicke, Love Letters indite,</L>
<L>To want on Females, I must touch the urne,</L>
<L>Thaw frosen hearts, and make them with zeale burne;</L>
<L>I do intend, all Mortalls to tell plaine,</L>
<L>From Earth they came, to Earth they must againe:</L>
<L>But yet before that sad tale I do begin,</L>
<L>Ile tell man what his Nature is, and how by sinne,</L>
<L>Death is his wages, assist me then great GOD,</L>
<L>Whilst I show man, how he may scape thy Rod:</L>
<L>Draw an Example from Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> all,</L>
<L>Whose Vertues lay obscured by his fall:</L>
<L>Mans definition is a Lump of Clay,</L>
<L>At first Divine, untill sinne drove away,</L>
<L>That happinesse, joy, and felicitie,</L>
<L>Were then transformed into miserie;</L>
<L>Then man sublime, by Nature did he grow,</L>
<L>His Soule with sinne, like high water did flow:</L>
<L>But Oh, Alas! by it what did he get,</L>
<L>A world of sorrow, and to live by swet:</L>
<L><HI>Adam</HI> did lead the way, and we like fooles,</L>
<L>Continue Trewants out of Vertues Schoole.</L>
<L>Poore men are not content, but murmur still,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="2">Because the World they have not at their will;</L>
<L>Rich men (like Poets <HI>Icarus</HI>) aloft do soare,</L>
<L>Never regarding they owe death a score;</L>
<L>Like <HI>Phaeton</HI> they vow for to ascend,</L>
<L>Although <HI>Ioves</HI> thunder, forces them to bend:</L>
<L>But whither ramble I? my Theame is to treate,</L>
<L>Of one whose Vertues once were counted great:</L>
<L>His vices I condole, wondering to see,</L>
<L>The Devils malice, link't with pollicie:</L>
<L>When he perceives a man like for to thrive,</L>
<L>In <HI>Gods</HI> affayres, then doth he plot and strive,</L>
<L>Casting his golden baytes, Riches, and pride,</L>
<L>To hale him from such vertues cleane aside:</L>
<L><HI>Angells</HI> rejoyce when as man doth do well,</L>
<L>Divells Triumph, when as he is in Hell:</L>
<L>Was not this man, whose deedes we did despise,</L>
<L>Once pious, vertuous, learned and wise;</L>
<L>Which caus'd our King his fortunes for to rayse&punc;</L>
<L>In an iron age, for to see golden dayes,</L>
<L>Which hee had enjoyd, had not the Divell,</L>
<L>By sugry baytes acquainted him with evill.</L>
<L>O what is wisdome if it be abus'd,</L>
<L>Or what the best of things, if but ill us'd;</L>
<L>The costliest jem, ill usage doth deface,</L>
<L>The best of men sometimes come to disgrace&punc;</L>
<L>Nor do I excuse him which doth amisse,</L>
<L>Nor will I Serpent like, at's sorrowes hiss</L>
<L>Had I his Honours upon me conferr'd,</L>
<L>Why might not I, as well as he been bar'd</L>
<L>From doing well, without JEHOVAHS ayd?</L>
<L>My fame with his, in darknesse might be layd;</L>
<L>O therefore let none in derision say,</L>
<L>There once the head of a false Traytor lay;</L>
<L>We all are Traytors unto Heaven, we all,</L>
<L>Are guilty of our Gransire <HI>Adams</HI> fall:</L>
<L>If GOD let slip, who is it which can stand?</L>
<L>The best may fall, and feele his powerfull hand.</L>
<L>Satan himselfe was once an Angell bright,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3">Who now is Prince of the infernall night.</L>
<L>Those which do think themselves clearest from sinne,</L>
<L>Know not the danger which their selves are in;</L>
<L>As before sayd, we all base Traytors are,</L>
<L>For which judgements do wait on us, though noe care,</L>
<L><HI>Is</HI> taken to repent, if GOD strikes, we</L>
<L>Suffer not Earths, but Hellish miserie.</L>
<L>Were GOD not mercifull this very day,</L>
<L>Death might Arrest, Oh who could his debt pay;</L>
<L>That were not for to loose a life or name,</L>
<L>Wife, or Children, or a glorious fame,</L>
<L>But Soule and body, which do far excell,</L>
<L>Such Earthly trifles and be cast in Hell.</L>
<L>But to my Theame againe, he wisdome had,</L>
<L>Honour and Riches, why was he so mad,</L>
<L>Then not to be content, but covet more,</L>
<L>And by ill courses to encrease his store;</L>
<L>Some such a question may propose I know,</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> answere thus, and thus their error show;</L>
<L>Why marvel'st thou that when man hath honour,</L>
<L>He is apt to follow Satans displayd Banner;</L>
<L>It is mans Nature still aloft to sore,</L>
<L>Though daily rising, yet would he rise more&punc;</L>
<L>Honour tis true, an Earthly blessing is,</L>
<L>But yet sometimes it makes man do amisse;</L>
<L>Aiming at honour what Tragedies have been,</L>
<L>Acted by puft up Spirits, blood was seen,</L>
<L>To die our Channels with a crimson gore,</L>
<L>Once here in <HI>England</HI> Traytors were sad store;</L>
<L>Man having Honours, and conjoyn'd with pride,</L>
<L>To all affections made a nuptiall Bride:</L>
<L>Whence came the <HI>Roman</HI> Civill War which taxt</L>
<L>The totall circle <HI>Orbe,</HI> and each man vext;</L>
<L>But by two Spirits honoured of all,</L>
<L>By which <HI>Caesar</HI> did rise, but <HI>Pompey</HI> fall:</L>
<L>Had not proud <HI>Haman</HI> honour as a King,</L>
<L>Who 'gainst poore <HI>Mordecaies</HI> complaints did ring;</L>
<L>Sitting i'th Gate and to him did not bend,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">Wherefore his Life on Gallowes he must end.</L>
<L>But he escap'd, and <HI>Haman</HI> he must dy,</L>
<L>His honour brought him unto miserie;</L>
<L>By which we may perceive, honour oft times,</L>
<L>Ruines that man which highest seemes to climbe?</L>
<L>But yet mistake me not, I do not say,</L>
<L>Honour makes all men perish and decay:</L>
<L>Be that far from me. Peeres are in our Land&punc;</L>
<L>Decked with Honour, and yet firmely stand;</L>
<L>But GOD protects them, he doth give them grace,</L>
<L>To rule their actions, and maintaine their place;</L>
<L>Which that he may do still, let good men pray,</L>
<L>And condole him, which lately went astray;</L>
<L>Let all lament, that Satan hath the force,</L>
<L>Man from his Heavenly maker to divorce;</L>
<L>To see that one, which late was of renowne,</L>
<L>By Satans malice should be overthrowne:</L>
<L>Gush out in teares yee barrenest of eyes,</L>
<L>Breake Adamantine hearts, that one so wise&punc;</L>
<L>Vnfortunate should be, so low to fall,</L>
<L>Let all good men lament his Funerall;</L>
<L>Not that he dyed, but that his death was bad,</L>
<L>Let that the object be to make us sad;</L>
<L>O yee Honours, why did yee not preserve</L>
<L>Your Masters life, why did you let him swarve,</L>
<L>From doing well, why did hee eschew good,</L>
<L>Stayning by Treason his most noble blood.</L>
<L>Why stand yee silent, and me no answere give,</L>
<L>Tell me where is your Master, doth he live?</L>
<L>Are Honours dumb, tell me yee riches then,</L>
<L>Where is your Lord, once famous amongst men</L>
<L>Methinks they answere me, and thus do say,</L>
<L>Going to death from him we sled away:</L>
<L>O why do men then with so greedy speed,</L>
<L>Run after Riches, when in our greatest need,</L>
<L>They cannot helpe us, why do mortalls so</L>
<L>Hugg Baggs of gold, authors of Terrene woe?</L>
<L>Honour and Riches each man doth desire,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y">Which causes are to set their hearts on fire:</L>
<L>With worldly vanities and damned sinne,</L>
<L>Which are the causes we do griefe live in;</L>
<L>O then contemne them, do them not regard,</L>
<L>But about thy Bul-wark still keepe watch and ward&punc;</L>
<L>Thy Soule I meane, which if but entered once,</L>
<L>Tis ten to one thou loosest not thy sconce;</L>
<L>O did we knowe the Devills malice all,</L>
<L>We would for Riches not so often call,</L>
<L>Which are but miseries, the Devills baytes,</L>
<L>Stuffed with venome, and cramb'd with decayts;</L>
<L>What will our Vsurers refuse to do,</L>
<L>To obtaine wealth, their Soules they will foregoe;</L>
<L>Rather than tenths ith hundred, as for death,</L>
<L>They do not feare it, push, they yet have breath.</L>
<L>O foolish worldling, sooth not up thy selfe,</L>
<L>That thou must live, because of worldly Pelfe:</L>
<L>This very night thy soule may taken be,</L>
<L>And then for gold thou'st nought but miserie:</L>
<L>Death feareth none, no not the greatest Kings,</L>
<L>Monarchs he wounds, and to the grave downe brings;</L>
<L>His dart can pierce the thickest Coate of Male,</L>
<L>Vndaunted still he rangeth with lookes pale,</L>
<L>And hideous, none sees him but doth fly,</L>
<L>All are afrayd Deaths dart for to come nigh,</L>
<L>But fly whither they came, Death wil them meet,</L>
<L>And for their Honour, give a winding Sheete;</L>
<L>Couragious Souldiers, and the Courtier neate&punc;</L>
<L>In person though tall, low, little or greate,</L>
<L>If Death say unto them, yee mortalls stand,</L>
<L>They dare not answere, Sir, at whose command?</L>
<L>If man but knewe his owne brittle estate,</L>
<L>And how he suject is unto each Fate:</L>
<L>His looks so lofty he would sure cast down,</L>
<L>Vpon his grave, dig'd in some hole ith' ground,</L>
<L>Who knows how soon his glasse it may be run,</L>
<L>Which being out, alas his life is done.</L>
<L>Then doth he wish he sooner had repent,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y">And in the world so vainly not been bent:</L>
<L>Their Riches, Honour, or their earthly fame,</L>
<L>Cannot redeem them from eternall shame.</L>
<L>As man must dye, so is there severall wayes</L>
<L>To cut him short, and end his wretched dayes.</L>
<L>None knowing when first borne what death to dye,</L>
<L>Whether by Rope&punc; Knife, Axe, Artillery.</L>
<L>My Lord of <HI>Strafford,</HI> once sure little thought</L>
<L>Crimes at so high a rate to have had bought.</L>
<L>Each man can tell what present is, but who</L>
<L>What in the future he shall undergoe?</L>
<L>Wherfore you which have honour and renown'd,</L>
<L>Be sure that guilty you be never found&punc;</L>
<L>In offering to your King and Countrey wrong&punc;</L>
<L>By haynous deeds, or by offensive tongue&punc;</L>
<L>If that your King doe shew unto you love,</L>
<L>Oh Love againe, and trechery remove</L>
<L>Farre from your hearts; if this you doe deny,</L>
<L>Though Noble, yet disgracefull death you die&punc;</L>
<L>Art thou admir'd for Wisdome, praise thy <HI>God,</HI></L>
<L>O be not selfe-conceited, least his rod</L>
<L>Doe bruise thee into Atomies; thy fame</L>
<L>Being metamorphosed to eternall shame.</L>
<L>Hast Honours, Riches? &ocirc; imploy them well,</L>
<L>He which is Righteous beares away the bell.</L>
<L>Without the which, what thing so ere be thine,</L>
<L>Is but vanitie, puft with blustring wind&punc;</L>
<L>They which desire to see JEHOVAHS face,</L>
<L>Earth must contemn, and seek for heavenly grace.</L>
<L>O let Lord <HI>Wentworths</HI> fall, which once was wise,</L>
<L>Cause us repent, that by it we may rise:</L>
<L>The quintessence of valour he accounted was,</L>
<L>But yet the Devill was too strong, alas!</L>
<L>Who can deride him? and not rather weep,</L>
<L>That he by Satan should be layd asleep</L>
<L>In vain securitie. <HI>Ireland</HI> forget his sinne,</L>
<L>Only forsake those steps which he trod in.</L>
<L>To <HI>Englands</HI> Peeres, let him example be&punc;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5" MS="y">Let them take warning by his miserie.</L>
<L>A Traytors name, &ocirc; let them count it base,</L>
