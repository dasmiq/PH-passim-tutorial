<P>VVherein is reasoned of the Neglect of Martiall Discipline, and inconueniences thereof: the comparison of VVeapons ancient and moderne, with their different Executions: the imperfections of many training Captaines: the perfect training of men, to great effect: the due sortment of VVeapons now vsed: the contempt of Souldiers, and causes thereof.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gentleman.</SPEAKER>
<P>_GOod Captaine, I pray, if your leysure will permit, let vs haue your companie some few dayes, familiarlie to dis|course with you vpon such matter as time, cause, and oc|casion shall minister: for since the rumour of this trou|blesome world towards,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The cause of the beginning of these Discourses.</HI></NOTE> I meane, besides the brables of Ireland, the great preparations of the ambitious Spani|ard, pretended as is thought against vs, both my selfe, &amp; other country Gentlemen, vnexperimented in such mar|tiall causes, haue not a litle mused thereupon: and so much the more, by reason of the straite charges and commands directed from her Maiestie, and her honourable priuie Counsell vnto vs of euerie Shire, to make good prouision of furniture, and our people to be well trained: the which see|meth not done without some great occasions knowne, or matters greatly suspe|cted: What thinke you of it?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Captaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I will drawe my leisure and poore skill to the vttermost, to satis|fie, in what I can, your curteous request. And first, concerning mine opinion touching the ambitious and proud minded Spaniard,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Spaniard, as well by his owne imperious incli|nation, as by the Pope &amp; Clergies suggestion, &amp; in|stigation of En|glish and Irish Papistes, hath these thirty years imagined Eng|lands subuersion. Example, in An|no</HI> 1588.</NOTE> I say; that besides her Ma|iestie and her honourable Counsell, it is not vnknowne vnto a number of honest gentlemen and souldiers of our nation, that the Spaniard hath aboue these thir|tie yeares, as well by his owne naturall imperious inclination, as by the Satani|call suggestion of the Romain Pope and Clergie, and continuall instigation of our English and Irish Papists, both desired, pretended and practised the vtter ruine, subuersion and conquest of our religion, state, and realme: the experiment whereof in <HI>Anno</HI> 1588. last, with his Inuincible Nauie, so by him tearmed, at|tempting our seas and coasts, we haue yet fresh in memorie: whereof wee may well say: <HI>Deus pro nobis pugnabat.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeede I doe not greatly maruell thereat, considering our long continued peace vnder our gracious Soueraignes raigne (whom God long main|taine ouer vs) wherein we haue not knowne what the name of warre hath meant, much lesse the effects therof:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Peace breedes se|curitie; securitie, carelesse mindes: carelesse mindes, contempt of war: contempt of war, vnmartial minds.

<P><HI>By neglect of mar+tiall disciplin, ma|ny kingdomes sub|uerted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Examples.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Good to shake off securitie, and be carefull for our safetie.</HI></P></NOTE> For long peace hath bred <HI>Securitie; securitie, care|lesse mindes; carelesse mindes: contempt of warre; contempt of warre, the dispising of souldiarie and Martiall discipline; the dispising of Martiall discipline, vnwilling mindes</HI> I feare me: so that it can hardly be beaten into our braines, I meane a number of vs, that we which so long haue found the fruites of peace, should euer feele the effects of warre. To proue that long peace, and neglect of Martiall disci|pline hath metamorphosed manly mindes, nay whole States and kingdomes; let vs consider the <HI>Macedonians</HI> prowesse, the <HI>Grecians</HI> policie, the <HI>Romaines</HI> va|lour, the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> stratagems, so long as they maintained Martiall discipline, ruled each the Monarchie in their times: but discipline neglected, disorders grew on, new Martialists sprung vp, and ouerturned their wealth, state, and kingdomes, with a finall ruine of their names and Nations.</P>
<P>I speake not this, but for example, to put vs the more in mind to shake off secu|ritie, to mistrust the worst, to make vs more readie and willing to be trayned in Martiall poyntes, not grudging at the charge, but frankely to offer it, to fit vs with furniture, and desirous to be instructed in the knowledge and managing of each armes in their kind; whereby if so proud an enemie should attempt anie thing against vs, we might be readie, with resolute mindes, to beard him to the vttermost.

<P>Will not a thousand bowes handled by good bowmen, do as good ser|uice, as a thousand hargubuze or muskets, especially amongst horsemen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, were there such bowmen as were in the old time, yet could there be no comparison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your reasons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, you must confesse that one of your best Archers can hardly shoot any good sheffe arrow aboue twelue score off, to performe any great executio~, ex|cept vpon a naked ma~,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bowes farre in|feriour vnto Cal|liuer or Musket.</HI></NOTE> or horse. A good Calliuer charged with good powder and bullet, and discharged at point blanck by any reasonable shot, will, at that distance, performe afar better execution, yea, to passe any armour, except it be of prooffe, &amp; much more neare the marke the~ your Archer shal: And the said Calliuer at ran|don will reach &amp; performe twentie, or foure and twentie score off, whereunto you haue few archers will come neare. And if you reply, that a good archer will shoot many shots to one;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The readinesse of the one and the other: with their different execu|tions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Archers may shoot in v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llie. The execution of the bow not com|parable to the musket.</HI></P></NOTE> Truly no, your archer shall hardly get one in fiue of a ready shot, nay happely scarce one; besides, considering the execution of the one and the other, there is great oddes, and no comparison at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But our bowmen may shoot by vollies, as thicke as hayle in the ayre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>They may shoot thicke, but to small performance, except (as I said) vpon naked men or horse. But should there be led but eight hundred perfect hargubu|ziers, or sixe hundred good musketiers against your thousand bowmen, I thinke your bowmen would be forced to forsake their ground, all premisses considered: and moreouer a vollie of musket or hargubuze goeth with more terrour, fury, and execution, then doth your vollie of arrowes. And againe, against a resolute troupe of horse, either Pistoletiers, Hargulatiers or Lanciers, they will sta~d lesse time (ex|cept they be well fro~ted with hedge, ditch or tre~ch; or seconded with a strong sta~d of pikes,) then either Hargubuze or Musket, considering the execution of the one &amp; the other.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The weapon not of deadly execu|tion, little to be feared.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bow men haue most vse in open field, and in set battels shot are vsed in all ser|uices.</HI></P></NOTE> And what souldier is he, that commeth against a weapon where|in there is little hazard of life, which will not more resolutely charge, then against a weapon, whose execution he knoweth to be present death? Many more reasons might be alledged for the sufficiencie of the one, and the insufficiencie of the other, but others haue answered the same already, besides the proofe which dayly experience bringeth: and thus you heare mine opinion of your Bowes; desiring you (Gentlemen and others) not to conceiue sinisterly of me for this mine opinion, as not held of me for any dislike I haue of our old Archery of England: but that common experience hath made it most manifest in these our later warres: well wishing in my hart (had it bene Gods good will) that this in|fernall fierie engine had neuer bin found out. Then might we boldly haue compa|red (as our auncestors did) with the proudest Archers in the world.</P>
<P>But you must note this by the way,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fierie weapo~ without practise dangerous to the handler.</HI></NOTE> that the fierie shot, either on horsebacke, or foote, being not in hands of the skilfull, may do vnto themselues more hurt then good: wherefore the same is often to be practised, that men may grow per|fect and skilfull therein.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, to stand in argument I will not, for I haue seene little triall either
<PB N="4" REF="7">
of the one or the other. But what thinke you of our abundance of blacke Billes which we thinke to be the next naturall weapon for the Englishman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>True it is, that in time past our nation hath performed round slaughter. worke therewith: but the warres and weapons are now altered from them dayes, and we must accommodate our selues to the now vsed weapons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To accommodate our selues to the now vsed wea|pons, ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and times.</HI></NOTE> order, and time, to answere our enimies with the semblable, else happely shall we finde ourselues short of our reckening, with our all-too late repentance. But might I haue, in stead of these blacke Bills and Iacks, so many good armed Pikes, I meane good Corslelts furnisht, I would thinke my selfe farre better either to offend or defend.</P>
</SP>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Not many short weapon in the field.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When to be vsed.</HI></P></NOTE>Truly no, not many, yet would I not exclude them all. For I know them necessarie for many peeces of seruice; as to performe executio~ if the enemie break, or flie; to mingle with shot to back them if neede be; to passe with Conuoyes, &amp; to stand by your Artillerie; to creepe along trenches, and enter into mynes, where the Pike would be ouerlong;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Target of Proof.</HI></NOTE> but best for the myne or breach is the Target of prooffe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pikes, most hono|rable weapon in the field.</HI></NOTE> short sword, and Pistoll: but for the plaine field, neither blacke bill, Hal|bard, nor Partizan comparable to the Pike.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Short weapon a|bout the Ensigne not so a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ailable as the Pike.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Reasons.</HI></P></NOTE>As few as might be&punc; for in their steds farre better were so many armed Pikes, in mine opinion, considering that in set Battailes when men come to the shock, or push of the Pike, they sarrie close together, and the first three, fiue, or se|uen rankes do beare the chiefe brunt; and entred so farre, men buckle Pell-Mell, close together, by which time commonlie the one side reculeth or swayeth, and a battell once reculing doth not lightlie hold long, so that ere the Center of the Bat|taill be touched one side must fall to disaray; men once disordered, they commonly fall to rout, the rout is pursued with slaughter and ruine. Against horse the like reasons are to be made: thus either to offend or defend, farre better is the Pike, then either Bill, or Halbard. And to conclude, the strength of the Battaile is the armed Pike,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The armed Pike, the stre~gth of the battaile.</HI></NOTE> so they be equally sorted with Harquebuze and Musket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>What meane you by equally sorted?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The equall sort|ment of weapons, offensiue and defensiue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Countrey people loth to bee at charge.</HI></P></NOTE>I meane as much to offend, as to defend: To offend I would wish to euery hundred men 25 Muskets, &amp; 25 Calliuers at the least, 40 armed Piks, 7 or 8 Hal|bards, and 2 or 3 Targets of proofe to defend, and so of all other numbers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your proportion I like well, but our countrey people are loth to be at the charges of so many costly weapons, although her Maiestie and her honorable priuie Counsell, haue giuen orders and directions for the same.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Our daungerous time to be regar|ded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Men liuing long in securitie, ama|zed in altera|tions.</HI></P></NOTE>I perceiue it to be so, whereat I grieue not a litle, considering, how dan|gerous is the time; how malicious, strong, &amp; politike is the enimie; how carelesse, yea senslesse are we; and how vnwilling to our owne weale? But should these your secure men once heare the Alarme of the enemie, (from the which God defend vs,) then should you soone see them alter their copies, chaunge their colours, forget their great bragges of blacke Bills and Bowes, and stand at their wittes ende what course to take; and should they yet recall their courage, and plucke vp their spirites, and dare to looke the enimie in the face, what guides (I pray) haue they?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Want of good guides.</HI></NOTE> It is not enough to say <HI>downe with them, downe with them,

your first sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Example of the first sort.</HI></NOTE> bring one of them into the field with a hundred men, he will ne|uer ranke them aright without helpe; and (God knoweth) with what puzzeling and toyle: there is the end of his seruice, yea and thinkes he hath done well too.

Well, this is well, say our Citizens and countrie people. But how farre all these Captaines are wide to shew their souldiers the right vse of each weapon, a man of meane iudgement may perceiue, much lesse to bring them to the face of the enemie without a manifest daunger,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Daungerous for vnexperimented Captains to bring men to fight.</HI></NOTE> or wilfull ouerthrowe: Examples hereof I might recite enow, but I pray God, if euer it come to the proofe, we leaue not too many examples our selues.

True it is, all men are not of one constitution of body, humours, and spirits: for some men are fit for warres, some for peace, some for the countrie, some for the citie, some for learning, some for manuall crafts, some to gouerne, some to bee gouerned, some able to conduct a Companie, but not a Regiment; some a Re|giment, but not a Royall Campe: of which last sort verie few are to be found.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confesse there hath bene, and is many times, great disorders committed by some professours and followers of warres; the which, in mine o|pinion, proceedeth from two causes: the one from the bad choise of some Cap|taines, Souldiers and Officers, made at the first, by those who had commission or authoritie for the same: next, by reason of the litle discipline vsed amongst those so chosen; for many haue bin chosen by fauor, friendship, or affectio~, litle respe|cting their experience, vertues, or vices; whereby most commonly, the fawning flatterer, the audacious prater, the subtill make-shift, is preferred before the si|lent man, the approoued person, or the plaine dealing fellow. Then such being chosen and preferred, how do you thinke the conduction shold be good? Againe, the Companies that are commonlie leuied,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Faults co~mitted by the Iustices of peace in leuying of Souldiers.</HI></NOTE> are drawne forth by the Iustices of peace, who to disburden their towne or shire of corrupt weeds, as they tearme it, do picke out the scumme of their countrie, thinking such men sufficient for the warres: what wrong thereby is done to the seruice, the issues of manie acti|ons do often times manifest. Now, such choise made both of souldiers and Cap|taines, what good can be expected from them? For litle amendment groweth where lewd Libertie beareth sway:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Litle amendment groweth where lewd liberty bea|reth sway.</HI></NOTE> for warres disorderlie vsed, is the <HI>Chaos</HI> of con|fusion; and warres well conducted and disciplined, is the Harmonie of Iustice.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray (good Captaine) sith you haue thus farre waded into the matter, let vs intreat you to shew vs the parts of a Souldier, the vse of his weapon, and the order of your moderne warre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>These three matters handled would aske a great volume, farre aboue my reach:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>All warres are either offensiue or defensiue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maintained, managed and conducted by mo|ney, men and armes, by policie, order, and by good Chiefs.</HI></P></NOTE> neuerthesse, to satisfie in part your curteous demaund, I will do my best. Then thus I beginne to reason: First, Warres are of two sorts, either offensiue, or defensiue; maintained and perfourmed with men, armour and money; managed with Policie, Order and Stratagems; conducted and perfected by a singular Generall, braue Commanders, and resolute Souldiers. To begin therefore from the lowest degree vnto the highest, I will declare vnto you what parts I could wish in euerie degree, and what order in the same, following herein for the

<P>Trulie, for strength, valour, and courage, I suppose vs comparable to a|ny nation whatsoeuer:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The English for valour and cou|rage comparable to anie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is the nature of euerie nation to thinke best of themselues.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vegetius opinio~s &amp; reasons, what climate breeds the best souldiers.</HI></P></NOTE> but surely for subtill policie and martiall discipline, especi|ally in this our latter age, some other nations do exceed vs. And it is the nature of euerie nation to esteeme and thinke best of themselues: but <HI>Vegetius</HI> holdeth opinion, the man borne vnder the temperate Zone and climate, to be fittest for warres: For (saith he) the Souldier of the Septentrionall or North Climate, by reason of his wide distance from the Sunne, doth abound in hot bloud, and is of good courage, and great strength: entring into battell without feare, but rash and inconsiderate in the same: voyd of consideration and counsell in most of his actions. And on the contrarie, the Meridionall man, by reason of the neerenesse of the Sunne, the which they haue almost for their Zenith, are fearefull and faint-hearted, and verie loth to enter into battell, except constrained and vrged ther|unto; but withall, verie subtill, warie and sharpe-witted: therefore (saith he) Men of the middle Climate, participating of both the extreames, are best for the warres; as men hardie, quicke, of great direction and counsell, well proportio|ned, and of reasonable good disposition and health. But I suppose, that of either nation by militarie discipline and practise,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Men born vnder any climate may proue good soul|diers by experie~ce and discipline.</HI></NOTE> may prooue good and excellent Warriours.</P>

<P>It is necessarie that he which entreth into this action, that hee ground his valorous determination vpon foure principles. First, vpon defence of true Religion: secondly, the honour of his Prince: thirdly, the safetie of his countrie: fourthly, diligently to
<PB N="9" REF="9">
learne the Art he professeth, which is warre, whereby many men of low degree and base linage haue attained vnto great dignitie, credit, and fame: as <HI>Caius Ma|rius,</HI> borne of poore parents in a village of the <HI>Arpines,</HI> came to be a famous com|mander of the Romanes: <HI>Valentinian,</HI> a poore mans sonne of <HI>Sybaly</HI> in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> a Romane Emperour: <HI>Maximinus,</HI> borne in a base towne of <HI>Thracia,</HI> vnto the like dignitie: and <HI>Nicholas Pichinnino,</HI> the sonne of a Butcher, to be Captaine gene|rall of <HI>Philip Vicount</HI> Duke of <HI>Millans</HI> army, and other Potentats of <HI>Italy.</HI> Many o|thers might be remembred, both English, French, Italian, and Spanish, borne of low degree, which by their value, vertue, prudence, and conduction, mounted to such high Types of honour.</P>
<P>Now he that taketh this resolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He ought to be diligent, careful, vigilant, and obe|dient: and aboue all to feare God.

To chuse to his Camaradas and companions men well acquainted, and of honest conditions; no factioners nor mutiners, whose company is more dangerous then the diuell himselfe. With his Camaradas, hee is to demeane himselfe, sober, quiet, and friendly: rather seuere then lauish in speeches: for licentious talkers do easily loose their friendes, their estimation and owne quietnesse.</P>
<P>Let him bee mindfull to serue God; for although all professions are thereto bound, yet none more deeply then the valiant souldier, whose actions are euery houre in danger of death: and without doubt, he that so doth, fighteth with more bold resolution and courage, and is thereby brought through manifold daungers, and vnto vnexpectable euents.</P>
<P>Let him bee no blasphemer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>No blasphemer.</HI></NOTE> nor swearer: for besides that such a one is infa|mous to the world, he is assured to be punished by Gods diuine iustice, whereof many examples haue bene seene.</P>
<P>Let him abstaine fro~ dice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>No idle game|sters.</HI></NOTE> cards, &amp; idle games; for common gamsters, although they haue many other good parts in them, yet are they not esteemed according to their better parts, but rather discredited, getting enemies, questions, and brawles, with many other inconueniences that followes.</P>

<P>In any wise let him eschue the beastly vice of drunkennesse; for crammed pan|ches and drunken nowls are apt to nothing but to be sluggish, slothfull, and drow|sie, and in their drunken pangs to haue their throates cut.

<P>Our souldier ought patiently to suffer the aduersities and trauels that do fall out in the courses and chances of warre also,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Patie~tly to suffer the aduersities of warre.</HI></NOTE> shewing tokens of true vertue, not to be ouergreedy and hasty for his pay, although he stand in great need thereof, but rather with chearefull countenance, shew his constancy, eschewing by all meanes possible, rebellions and mutinies, which often vpon such cases do succeede, and in no case be partaker with mutiners, for alwayes the end of such, is sharpe and shamefull death: examples whereof are rife in euery nation.</P>

<P>The like consideration he ought to haue in the expugnation of any fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To pursue the vi|ctorie throughly. Not cruell vpon cold bloud.</HI></NOTE> city or towne. He shall pursue the victorie euen vntill the enemy be wholie yeelded, and rendred, and licence graunted to fall vnto the sacke and spoile: wherein he shall de|porte himselfe neither cruell nor couetous, as a number of bad and gracelesse fel|lowes doe, which without respect of God or man, do leaue no kinde of rauening crueltie vncommitted,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fauourable and mercifull to the humble vanqui|shed.</HI></NOTE> with brutall rauishment both of women and maides, and with mercilesse murdering of poore innocents yeelded: rather in such cases shall he shew himselfe fauourable and mercifull to the humble vanquished, procuring

The pike and corselet is of most e|stimation with footmen, for being a weapon of most firmenesse in the field, wher|with all squares of men are formed, as a most sure defence against the fury of horsemen. Of fierie manuall weapons, the musket is of most execution and force; next to them, the calliuers; those to enuiron the pikes, and to be deuided into ma|ny small troupes and bands, do serue to best purpose.</P>
<P>Let him practise each sort of weapon, although he professe the Pike, Calliuer or Musket, and particularly the sword and target; the which in mine opinion is ve|rie important to many effectes, where men ioyne close together: and moreouer they be very necessarie, to view, and reknowledge batteries, to begin assaults, to make an entrance, to giue a <HI>Camisada,</HI> &amp; to many other purposes presented in wars.</P>

<P>It is also a great point in a souldier to be skilfull in swimming:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To be skilfull in swimming.</HI></NOTE> as at imbark|ments, disimbarkments, and passing ouer riuers, and sundry other occasions inci|dent to warres.</P>

The faults herein committed, are seuerely to be punished: for in Sentinels consisteth the security of the campe.

In fine, there shall he behold the state of Peace and Warre.</P>
<P>And for as much as no man can reduce those things vnto perfection where|of he is ignorant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carefull to marke the courses kept by his superior officers.</HI></NOTE> and knoweth not the Arte, let him diligently marke, consi|der, and remember the orders which the higher Officers doe obserue, in fra|ming their Squadrons of Infanterie and Cauallerie, and the place of the great Artilerie in the march, field and Campe; and the plot of the alodgement ac|cording to the disposition of the ground where the Campe shall then be, with the manner of the intrenching, with the placing of the Ordinance, and defences for the same.</P>
<P>And if he find himselfe at the siege of any strong place, towne or fortresse, let him diligently view the situation, and the order that is taken for the batterie thereof: and if happily he be within a fort of defence; let him well marke the course that is taken for the defending thereof.

<P>He shall perswade them to goe neat and cleane in their apparell, but with mo|destie and profite.

<P>The ancient <HI>Romanes</HI> reparted the people of their Armies into Legions, Cohorts, Centuries, and Maniples: and to be seuerallie knowne, they caried vp|on speares or pikes ends, the figures of Eagles, Dragons, and such like; and some the pictures of their Emperour, and called the same <HI>Signa</HI>: whereupon the <HI>Itali|an</HI> and <HI>French</HI> calleth them <HI>Insignes</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Wherfore called Ensignes.</HI></P>

<P>Now, the Ensigne made and finished, &amp; fastened vnto a speare-headed staffe, sharpe pointed with iron, the Captaine with his own hands deliuereth it vnto his Ensigne-bearer, encharging him the custodie &amp; defence therof, with a solemne oth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The Ensignes de|liuered to the Ensigne-bearer by the Captaine with great solem+nity and oath.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The Ensigne bea|rer to go gallant|ly armed.</HI></P></NOTE> to be true to his Prince and Captaine; accompanied with manie honoura|ble words, the which he is bound to returne to the Captaine, if the Companie be dissolued or casht, before any notable peece of seruice perfourmed, either at breach, batterie, encounter, or battell, wherein he hath valiantly fought, and ho|nourably defended the same; for from thence forward it is the Alferes due, as de|serued for his manhood &amp; valour: but yet to receiue the same from the Captaine as an honourable gift.</P>
<P>He shall alwaies go gallant &amp; well armed, with a faire Corslet, Burgonet, short sword and meane dagger, which are his proper arming, with a faire Halberd, when he beareth not his Colours, borne after him to his lodging, or elsewhere, thereby to be the better respected and knowne.</P>

<P>The Romanes deuided their foot people of warre into men armed with heauie armour, (or, as we may tearme it, armor complete) and into light armed men.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Grauis arma|tura of the Ro|manes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Velites of the Ro|manes, and their armings.</HI></P></NOTE> Those which were light armed, they called by one common name, <HI>Velites</HI>; vnder which word they vnderstood all such as carried slinges, darts, bowes, crosse-bowes, and such like: the greatest part of whom, were armed with a skull or close Cellat for the head; and had, besides their other weapons, a shield or Target vp|on their left arme to defend and couer themselues, and did fight or skirmish in straggling sort, a good distance from those that were armed with heauie or com|plete armour in Squadron. Vnto those may we well compare our shot, especially them of the forlorne hope, or <HI>Enfans Perdus,</HI> as the French doe terme them. Their people armed with heauie or complete armour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The arming of those of grauis armatura.</HI></NOTE> had first a Cellat or Bur|gonet, which couered their head, and reached ouer their shoulders: then for their bodie a Cuyrasse, whose flappes or tasses couered their thighes, euen down to the knees; their legges and armes were armed with Greaues and Vambraces: and for their defence they carried a shield of foure foote long, and two foot and a halfe broad, bound about with a band of yron; and for weapon they had a sword, not ouer long, girt vnto their left side, &amp; a short dagger vpon their right; and in their hand a Iauelin or Dart, which they called <HI>Pilum,</HI> the which at the beginning of their fight they did lance or dart at the enemie: vnto these may we compare our Corslets and Pykes, whereof we frame our battels or battaillions: and our armed halbards, partizans, and other short weapon. Commonly a Romane army con|sisted of two Romane Legions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Romane armie.</HI></NOTE> which was a Consuls armie, and of two <HI>Auxiliarie</HI> legions, which were of their friends or confederates.</P>
<P>Their Legion consisted at the first, but of three thousand footmen, and three hundred horse;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Romane legion Coho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, Centurie, Maniple.</HI></NOTE> but afterwards encreased vnto 5.6 or 8000. foote.

<P>I suppose,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whom fittest to be chosen for souldiers.

Now the signes whereby to coniecture the persons most apt for warres, by the Phisiognomie, and proportion of bodie, are these: The eyes quicke, liuely &amp; piercing; the head and countenance vpright; the breast broad and strong; the shoulders large; the armes long; the fingers strong and synowie; the belly thinne; the ribbes large; the thigh bigge; the legge full, and the foote leane and drie: for whosoeuer is of this disposition, and with these conditions, cannot chuse but be nimble and strong, which are two quali|ties, chiefly to be required in a souldier.</P>
<P>I could wish that those Bandes which are appointed to be trayned (for of the Officers I haue spoken before) should be by their Captaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New souldiers to be often trai|ned.</HI></NOTE> Muster-maister, and other Officers, trayned at the least once euery moneth, or oftener, as the wea|ther and season will permit: and euery Caporall, with his <HI>Cabos de Camera,</HI> to traine and instruct their Esquadra, especially of shot, once euery weeke, or once euery fortnight at the least: ensigning them the vse of their weapon, and order of sleight skirmish:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Practise bree|deth readinesse.</HI></NOTE> For often practise maketh men readie, especially and shot, the which without readinesse and skill is a weapon of litle aduantage; and in the hands of perfect souldiers, is a weapon of great aduantage, and of wonderfull execution.</P>

<P>First hauing his companie leauied and chosen of the better sort of peo|ple, as is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rules to be obser|ued by a carefull Captaine.</HI></NOTE> let your rawe Captaine, (for so I terme those which neuer were in action) prouide himselfe, if possible he may, of a good Lieutenant, and a suffici|ent Sergeant, and a skilfull Drummer.

<P>Now hauing suted euery man with a conuenient weapon, I would wish your Muster-maister, if your Captaine haue not the skil (for your Muster-master ought to be a man of experience) first to declare vnto them the partes that ought to be in a souldier in generall,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Militarie points to be ensigned new souldiers.</HI></NOTE> as before is declared; then to ensigne them the right carriage of their armes and weapon: then to knowe the seuerall soundes of the

First therfore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Harquebu|zier his armings and weapons.</HI></NOTE> the soldier that is appointed to cary a calliuer, is first to be en|signed how to cary his peece vpon his left shoulder, with his flaske at his girdle, or ha~ging by at Port-flask, or Flask-leather vpo~ the right thigh, &amp; vpo~ the left side of his girdle, to haue his touchboxe fastened by the string, hanging downe somwhat long by the strings, sufficient to be taken, and to prime his peece with touch-pow|der: and on his right side a Bullet bagge or purse of canuas, or leather for bullets. Also some three or foure yards of match, in seuerall peeces hanging at his girdle, with one peece of match of a yard long in his left hand, holden fast by the third finger of the same hand, hauing the one or both the endes of the same, lighted, or fired.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To charge.</HI></NOTE> Also to be prouided of a priming iron or wyer, of a steele and flint stone, to strike fire vpon any suddaine occasion, either to spare the burning of match, or to fire their matches if the same do chance to go out. Then how to charge his peece, either with his flask or bandelier, &amp; the~ to let slip the bullet down into the barrell after the powder, and to ramme the same with paper, tow or such like, thrusting the same downe with the scouring stick, if time will permit: or else (a more readier way) thus; After that the bullet is slipped downe vnto the powder, to put after the same some two or three cornes of powder, which will wedge fast the bullet. This being done,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To cocke the match.</HI></NOTE> let him hold his Calliuer with his left hand, (as in his charging hee ought to do the like) griping the same by the stocke, somewhat neare vnder the cock, betwixt his thombe and foure fingers; then, holding the nose of his peece somwhat vpward (for not to enda~ger his fellows) to take the one end of his lighted match, with his forefinger, midle finger, &amp; tho~be of his right ha~d, &amp; so to cock the same, hauing a regard that it may fall due within the pan: finally if it be a crooked stock peece, to set the same vnto the left side of his breast, retiring his right foot some halfe step behind the left, or aduancing the left foot some halfe pace before the right,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To leuell.</HI></NOTE> and so to take his due leuel: &amp; holding the hindermost part of the stocke betwixt the thombe and fore-finger of his right hand, &amp; with the other three fin|gers to draw to the serre,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To discharge.</HI></NOTE> &amp; so to discharge his peece with agility hauing done the

And for other armes he is to be fitted with a short sword, and meane dagger, and a Spanish morion. Now the musketier is to cary his musket vpon his left or right shoulder;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The musketier his arming and his forke weapon.</HI></NOTE> for it importeth not much on whether, so they obserue the order of the first rancke, with his Forke or rest in his left hand, fastned about his hand wrest or little finger by a string, hauing his flask and touchbox fitted as before is sayd, or hauing a bandalier, the same to be ouer the left shoulder,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To charge.</HI></NOTE> and vnder the right arme.

Also the same is vsed by some, at their arri|uing vnto the corps de guard, at the setting of the watch before their chief Com|mander or officer; euen as the first ranke shall arriue into the corps de guard, some ten or twelue pases from the place of their stand; to arbolare their pikes; and so rancke after ranck, carrying them in the same order vntill they come vnto their place of station, there to make Alto, and to plant their pikes vpon the ground, as the squadron is formed.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To present, To charge.</HI></NOTE> But principally, the souldiers marching in squadron, and vpon point to come to the push of the pike with their foote enemy, then are they first to aduaunce their pikes, as is said, bearing the same orderly with the right hand against the right thigh, and the left hand aboue neare about the shoul|der, and so to charge vpon the left hand and push,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To push.</HI></NOTE> standing firme and sure vpon the left foote.

<P>Now how necessary and auayleable this continuall vse and practise is, may easi|ly be gathered from the sundry victories of the auncient <HI>Romanes.</HI> Who both in their Campes and Garrisons had their <HI>Tesserarios</HI> (which were as our Sergeant Maiors) to ensigne and teach their people of warre the vse and managing of their armes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Romains Tesserarios their training.</HI></NOTE> at all idle and vacant times. The old souldier, sometimes once in a day, and the <HI>Tirones,</HI> which we terme <HI>Bisognios,</HI> or new souldiers, twise in the day, or as occasion serued: so were their people alwayes ready and perfect. And againe they did not onely practise them in the knowledge of their weapons, but many times also did conduct their Companies for their recreation into the field, there causing them to run,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vertuous exercis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI></NOTE> to leape, to iumpe, to wrastle, to throw the sledge, to pitch the barre, and such like exercises; and sometimes also to learne to swim, as a qua|litie very befitting a souldier.

Thus with these exercises they brought their people to be able, quicke, and ready to serue v|pon all occasions, and did more good seruice with twentie thousand of such so trained and practised,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ready men, ad|uantagious.</HI></NOTE> then with thirtie or fortie thousand of raw and vntrained men: But to haue a souldier to be very perfect, and a good executioner indeede, it is needfull to haue bin in some good peeces of seruice, &amp; to haue seene men to fall on both sides,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>To be a good exe|cutioner must haue seene seruice.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to what end serueth all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marie, to many good purposes: For the first order of doubling the ranks (besides the readinesse it breedeth in the souldiers) doth serue to alter vpon a sud|den your grand square of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doubling of ranks and files serueth to sundry purposes.</HI></NOTE> into a square of ground, or into a battell of dou|ble front, and to many other purposes, in framing of many small battallions one grand square. And againe, the second order in doubling of the files, doth serue to many such other purposes: as if vpon a sudden your foot enemy shall come to charge you vpon the flanke, then by doubling their files, and suddenly turning their faces vpon the enemie, they shall make of flanke the front, and so bee ready with double hands, either to receiue or giue the charge. For those battels of square of ground, or battels of double fronts, do bring many hands to fight at once: being verie aduantagious for footmen against footmen, as reason and ex|perience proueth and sheweth.</P>
<P>And againe, if you draw or diuide your battell or battallions into maniples, to march through straights or narrow passages,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To passe straights</HI></NOTE> this order of doubling the files is verie ready and auaileable, as thus. If your battel or squadron be of 5184 pikes, whose square roote is 72: now your passage will permit but 8 men to march in front; then must you diuide your square root 72 by 8, so commeth it to be 9 ma|niples of 8 men in rank or breadth. And say yet againe, that the straight or passage doth fall yet more narrow, or straighten lesse, then to containe 8 men in front, the~ cause euery maniple, at the verie entring of the straight, to double their files, and so of 8 you shall make 4 files per maniple: the which being shouldred vp close to|gether, will containe no more roome in breadth then the 8 did before. And ha|uing passed the straight, cause them to fall into their former proportion, and so maniple after maniple in passing the straight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if the squadron or maniple were of od nu~bers, it wold not so fal out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Od files or ranks.</HI></NOTE>That importeth not: for the od file or rank which resteth vndoubled, may in passing of the straight, close vp shoulder to shoulder vnto the rest, obseruing their proper stations in files; and if the passage will not permit that, then to fall backe after the traine of their maniple, &amp; hauing passed the straight, to sleeue vp in file, pouldron to pouldron of their fellowes, and so to fall into their former pro|portion. The like of any other od numbers may be done with very great facility.</P>
<P>Now, for as much as I entend to frame both figures and tables of sundry sorts of battels and battallions, in our discourse following&punc; I will at this instant bee the more briefe; supposing this, at this present to suffice. For he which conceiueth and
<PB N="41" REF="25">
vnderstandeth this well, may do the like with any other numbers great or small.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what course do you appoint the shot belonging to those numbers of pikes, to obserue in these alterations of proportion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>The shot appertaining vnto euerie such number,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shot, how to be practised.</HI></NOTE> may be practised in the like or semblable sort, either alone by themselues, or placed in two grand sleeues along by the flanks of their squadron or battallions.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Example.</HI></NOTE> As for example: If vnto the former number of 100 pikes, there were proportioned &amp; suted 100 shot, calliuer and musket, these would I draw out into 5 <HI>per</HI> rank, which would make 20 ranks. Those 20 ranks would I cut off or deuide in the middest, so should I haue 10 ranks for to sleeue the one flanke of the battallion, and 10 ranks for the other flanke, at 5 men per ranke, or 5 files in euery ranke, which is all one. These 2 sleeues being placed, may be doubled with the pikes by ranke or file, for practise sake only. But if you were engaged to fight with the enemie, I would wish all great sleeues of shot to be deuided into many small troupes, the one still to second another: as hereaf|ter shall be declared &amp; shewed. And lo here another order: the 2 grand sleeues be|ing al musketiers, as the battell or battallio~ doth aduance &amp; march on toward the enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Musketiers, how to discharge vpon a march.</HI></NOTE> &amp; comming once within reach of the musket, then the first ranks of these sleeues of muskets many discharge in marching in this sort. The first ranks step|ping some two or three paces forward, &amp; there those of the right sleeue to step one halfe pace toward the right ha~d, &amp; those of the left sleeue, one half pase toward the left hand, hauing in the meane space made themselues ready, and cocked their matches, then with readinesse &amp; expedition all those of the~ first ranks, their mus|kets being vpon their rests or forks, to discharge at once, and keep their station, &amp; charge againe, permitting other rankes to proceed before them. Then presently those of the second ranke to step vp iust before the first rank, as the battell or bat|tallion marcheth, and so to discharge as their former fellowes had done before: &amp; then the 3. rank before the 2. &amp; the 4. before the 3. and so all the other ranks con|sequently with this kind of double march: and at the traine of the last rank, those of the first to follow vp againe:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How to discharge vpon a counter|march.</HI></NOTE> and so consequently the rest. But if it chance their squadron of pikes to be distressed, &amp; forced to retire, they are to discharge at the e|nemy, retiring backe, vpon a countermarch, as these figures following shal plain|lie denote vnto you the maner and order.</P>

Now to conclude these orders of training, I will set downe one point more to be obserued by one single company, or two, or three companies ioyntly comming into the Corps de gard to their watch, reseruing many other particular matters vntil I come to treat of the office of the Sergeant Maior, where many Militarie points shall be at large discoursed. You must note that euery single company marching &amp; training alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The arraunging of a small compa|ny to march.</HI></NOTE> their pikes are first ranked by 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 or more in a rancke, according to their number (the number of euen or od, in ranke importeth nothing, as I sayd before) hauing their ensigne, and halbards contained within the center or middle ranke of their pikes. Then the shot is to be ranked altogether with the like number of men in a ranke, and
<PB N="44" REF="27">
then to cut them off, or deuide them at the middle ranke; leading the one halfe of them vnto the forefront of the pikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Order to be ob|serued entring in|to the Corps de gard.</HI></NOTE> and there to place them in euen files with the pikes, and the other halfe is to be brought vnto the traine of the pikes, and there filed in like maner, alwayes regarding to place the muskets of the first halfe of your shot, in the formost rankes, and those of the other halfe, in the hindermost ranke. Now thus marching on, and comming to the place of Corps de gard, the shot of the vantgard are to make Alto, or stand, then the pikes to march vp by, them; and the first ranke of pikes comming vnto the formost ranke of the shot, to make Alto also, and then the pikes to double their rankes, as before is declared, to bring themselues into squadron, euen ranke for ranke with the shot. This being done, then the other shot of the rereward is to march vp vpo~ the other hand of the pikes, ranke for ranke with the said square of pikes: and so is your squadron or battallion formed as by these figures following may appeare; where I suppose one or two companies together in march,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The march.</HI></NOTE> containing in all 100 pikes, and halberds, &amp; 100 shot, they march on 5 <HI>per</HI> ranke; the shot of the vantgard makes their stand, then do the pikes march vp by them, &amp; comming vnto their formost ranke of the shot do stand also; and there double their rankes, so are they 10 rankes, and ten files: lastly commeth vp the shot of the arereward &amp; garnisheth the other flanke, euen ranke with ranke, and so is the squadron framed and garnished with shot.</P>

<P>_TThen I pray passe to your other officers of warre.</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>There be many petie officers vsed amongst vs, as Clarke of the band, Drummer, Forrage maister, Scout maister, Trench ma|ister, Quarter maister, Caporals of the field, &amp; such like, of whom I will speake particularly nothing; but including them vnder the charge of other superior officers: of the which I will begin with the duty of a Sergeant Maior, whose office is of such importance, care, industry and skill, espe|cially in day of battell, that I must be constrained before I enter into the parts of his office, to describe the orders of fights and battels most vsed in these our mo|derne wars, as a thing most pertinent vnto the aforesaid officer, touching the sun|dry formes of battels vsed by antiquity; wherein (in mine opinion) the Romaines did most excell: I will speake, at this instant, litle more then what is sayd be|fore, considering that ages, times, occurrents, inuentions and customes haue altred, and dayly doth, what antiquity thought best and best assured.</P>
<P>The formes of battels in our time are not many, yet euery man almost hath a seuerall opinion thereof; but common reason and experience hath made most men confesse and agree, that of all formes the square battell, be it either of square of men, or square of ground, is the most assured, most strong, and most apt to bee reduced into any other forme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>What meane you by this word Battell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the word Battell, I vnderstand in this place a whole vnited body of souldiers well disciplined, all armed with pikes, to fight in day of battell, an act of armes, with good hope of victory, the which for more security hath the front, the traine, and the two flankes of complet corslets, to the end that being assayled or charged, they may make the face or front of any or euery side or part; and vali|antly receiue the charge, and may also charge and breake the enemy, and at|taine the victory.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">allery &amp; shot, not contai|ned within the body of the bat|tell.</HI></NOTE> Now in this body I vnderstand neither the shot, nor cauallery, the which are to haue an other order to another end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are these battels framed in one sort onely, or in more, or in many, or in how many; or what maner I pray are they made?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt</SPEAKER>
<P>Your curious demand deserueth answer, I tolde you before that many sorts of battels haue beene framed by valiant and expert Captaines: but the best approued, and most vsed now, is the square battell, be it either of men or ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="28">
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would gladly know the reason why they make their battels square; and what is meant by square of men and square of ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The reason why battells are fra|med in quadrat proportion.</HI></NOTE>Battels are made square, &amp; so vsed, for that they are apt to frame the Front of euery side or part, which could not be if they were Triangles, or of any other forme vsed by antiquitie. And it doth much import that the Front be gaillard and strong: for the front once broken, the battell stands in hazard. And againe, to ser|rie or close Pouldron to Pouldron the square forme is best: for that they close e|quallie together, &amp; strengthen the front to the victorie. And this shall suffice tou|ching the Quadrat.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Square of men, &amp; square of ground, what it is.</HI></NOTE> Now, concerning the difference of square of men, and square of ground, I say: that the square of men is, when there be so many men in front as in flanke, or so many in length as in breadth; and this sort of battell com|meth to bee in ground two times, and one third more long then broade, and a Quadrat of ground will bee of men two times and one third more broade then long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>In how many maners may these square battels be made?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were the Companies all of pikes, with corslets complet and not mixt with bare pikes, (which is not lightly to bee found) the framing of any of these sorts of battels would be very ready and easie, and might be soone brought into any proportion without confusion: the which being of pikes armed and vnar|med, will require more care,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Battells consisting of armed and vn|armed pikes, fra|med in three ma|ner of wayes.</HI></NOTE> labour, and paines, to the framing thereof. Now therefore I say, in three sorts or maners, most auaileable and most commo|diously are battels framed in these dayes, consisting of armed and vnar|med pikes.</P>
<P N="1">1 The first manner is when an army doth march with the one halfe of the armed pikes in the foreward, and the other halfe in the reareward of the vn|armed pikes. Now in the body of this battell I vnderstand no short weapon, (but reserue them to another place and vnto another purpose, as before I haue sayd, and will heareafter speake more thereof) but all pikes, for the battell thereby wold be more readily framed, more brauer in sight, and more stronger to fight, in mine opinion.</P>
<P N="2">2 The second fashion is, when the army marcheth company by company, with their armed pikes in the foreward and reareward of euerie particular com|panie.</P>
<P N="3">3 The third order is, when an armie marcheth <HI>Maniple</HI> by <HI>Maniple,</HI> with the armed pikes in the Front and traine of euery particular <HI>Maniple.</HI> And besides this, when the armed pikes which do serue to arme the two flankes, do march the one part before, &amp; the other part behind, and these also are called <HI>Maniples</HI>: for a <HI>Maniple</HI> is here called so many rankes throughout the battell, as the battell is in length,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Maniple, what it is.</HI></NOTE> at so many <HI>per</HI> ranke as they march in ordinance or array. And although the armed pikes which doe march at the head or taile of the arrayes of <HI>Maniples</HI> to arme the two sides, if it happen at any time that they march not to the full length of the battell, yet neuerthelesse when they be put vnto their office to arme the two sides, although they be not in length to the length of the battell, at so many in rank as is appointed to arme the two flankes, yet are they called <HI>Ma|niples</HI> also. And againe, any part of shot or pikes, that be drawne a part, to be set to defend any straight, or to scarmush, may also bee called a <HI>Maniple</HI>: but
<PB N="47" REF="28">
being shot,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shot in troupe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></NOTE> are fitter called troupes, after the french word.</P>
<P>Now of these sundry sorts of imbattailling of men, as well of proportions of e|quality as of inequality, and of battallions of the same nature, as well euen as odde battallions, seruing to the framing of crosse battels with such other like, I will frame certaine calculations or tables, the which shall serue to sundry numbers of men &amp; orders, according to the iudgement of the skilfull souldier, which shall be in the last booke of these discourses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But me thinkes you are not much affected to haue any halberdes or billes in your battell, which is contrary to our opinion and custome: for we call them the gard of the ensignes, and slaughter of the field.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Halberds and short weapon no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> liked of in the bo|dy of the battell. The reasons why.</HI></NOTE> I would not wish any such weapon in the body of a standing battell, if we might be prouided otherwise of pikes: my reasons are these. For the pikes being Terciard or charged ouer hand to encounter a battell of foot|men, or couched vnder the foote to receiue any troupes of horse, do one of them fall so proportionally within or after another; euen as their rankes of men are di|stant in their seuerall stations, the second following the first, the third the second, and the fourth following the third, and so consequently euery ranke se|conding one another, that it seemeth it were as good for a man to come vpon a brasen wall (if they stand resolute) as vpon such a battell of pikes, except they should be marched or encountred with the like weapons and proportions. Now if this be the best course to receiue or charge footmen, then no doubt (not be|ing thus mingled with short weapons) it must needes be the best battell to re|ceiue a charge of horse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Although you disalow and disproue to haue your battell of pikes mingled with short weapon; yet would you not alow them about the ensignes in the center of the battell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt</SPEAKER>
<P>For what purpose in the center of the battell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>To defend the ensignes with hand blowes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose it an error.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Halberds not liked of about the co|lours.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The reasons why.</HI></P></NOTE> For who doth not know that if the enemy be like to be victor, the armed pikes will yeeld backward as they feele themselues distressed, so as when the pikes are in such maner crashed and clustred together, that they can no longer charge and push with their pikes, then will the throng or presse in the center be so great, that the halberds and bils shall haue little roome to strike; nay short swords will hardly haue rome at that instant either to thrust or to strike. I would thinke daggers would do more execution at that time, and in that presse vntill one side fall to flight:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Daggers auail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|able in pell mell. Short weapon in a stand of pikes vn|seemeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></NOTE> so I see no reason at all for halberds or bills to haue place in a battell or stand of pikes: Besides the vnseemely shew they make either by themselues in the center, or mingled among pikes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I perceiue you would quight exclude all halberds and bils out of your battell, and so not at all to be vsed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Conclude not so short vpon me, because I giue them no place within the body of the battell. For if you remember, in our former discourses, at the e|quall sortment of weapons, I allowed to euery hundred of men 8 or 10 halberds. The which bils and halberds with other short weapons as swords and targets,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Short weapon their places of best seruice.</HI></NOTE> and long swords, and such like, shall serue as in a place of best seruice for them, to mingle with your naked troupes of shot, and also (placed with some pikes) for
<PB N="48" REF="29">
the gard of the cariage and munition and ordinance, or for execution if the ene|my begin to breake and slye, with sundry such seruices not contained in the bo|dy of the battell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you haue satisfied vs herein; but what thinke you of sundry other opinions touching the lining of battels with shot or bowes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Lyning of battels with shot or bowes disliked.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lyning of shot in single ranke.</HI></P></NOTE>Touching such lining I will shew you mine opinion against them. Now first for that kind of lining which is vsed in placing a pike and a shot, I am sure that the shot cannot be so hurtfull to the enemy, as they will weaken the battell: my reason is this. No army, I am certaine, shall be so ordered, that the battell shall be left bare without his troupes of shot before, to keepe the enemy doing in skir|mish, vntill the battels be ready to ioyne, and charge or couch their pikes: at that instant haue the shot, that line the battell, their time to serue, euen as the pikes are couched,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The reasons.</HI></NOTE> and not before. Now let men of consideration and experience iudge, whether it be possible for them to discharge aboue one shot a peece, and that not aboue three rankes of them; and thereupon, whether those shot can at that time of seruice be such a strength to the battel, as if an armed pike were in the roome. I do suppose the battell would be much stronger, if the shot were rid from thence, and pikes in their places. Then it falleth out, that this kind of lining is not good.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lyning with shot in another sort more tollerable.</HI></NOTE> Now, touching another kind of lining with shot, which is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, rankes of pikes; and then 3, 4, or 5 rankes of shot, and then pikes, and then shot a|gaine. In deede this kind of lining is the most tollerable, and yet not without his discommodities: for if such a battell ioyne with a battell of foote, the shot cannot play vntill the rankes of pikes before them are broken; which cannot be, but that their owne men and their enemy shall be mingled pell mell one among ano|ther. Then tell me by reason, how those shot can serue that are the lining, but they must needes kill as well their owne men, as their enemy, being thus min|gled at all aduentures. And if this be the end of their seruice (as indeede it is) by a forced necessity to kill without choise, then must it needes follow, that they are rather hurtfull then seruiceable in that place: farre better therefore pikes in their romes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lyning with bowes, a comber|some tying wea|pon.</HI></NOTE>And now for your lining with bowes, a combersome tying weapon in a throng of men; it must needes bee concluded by reason, that where calliuers, which are no tying weapons, are yet vnprofitable, in that place how can bowes, to which it requireth such elbow rome, and are so troublesome, be any wayes in that sort commodious or to be allowed?</P>

<P>To bring these fractions into whole numbers of proportion, you must worke thus: Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction, and adding thereunto the numerator of the said fraction, the proportio~ is found: as for exam|ple, to haue the battell to containe two times, and a third more broade then long&punc; I seeke in the table 2 &frac13; whereof the whole number is 2, and the fraction is &frac13;. Now multiply the whole number 2, by the fractions denominator 3, and it maketh 6, whereunto ad the fractions numerator, which is 1, and it amounteth 7, so is 2 &frac13; in proportion as 7 is to 3, and so must you worke any the like numbers.</P>
<P>In all these aforesayd proportions, to make the battels of proportion of equali|ty, that is as broade as it is deepe, or of inequality, which is more in breadth then in depth, both these wayes is to bee vnderstood of men, and not of ground; for of the proportions of ground I will speake hereafter.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>These proportions of men and not of ground.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>I will most willingly: Therefore to begin, I will set downe to make a square battell of number of men, that is, so many men in front as in flanke: And let our whole number be 5000 men, of armed pikes, and single pikes one with ano|ther. Now to frame this quadrat battell, you shall take in the aforesaid tables, the numbers of proportions of equality, which are as 1 to 1. Then must you set downe your rule in this sort:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rule to frame a square battell of men.</HI></NOTE> Setting downe first the proportion of equality for the first and second number, and the number of men for the third number, thus 1 <HI>prime,</HI> 1 <HI>second,</HI> 5000 third. This being done, multiplie the 3 number which is 5000, the number of men by 1, the second number, and it maketh still 5000, (for 1 doth neither multiplie nor deuide) then deuide the said first multiplied number 5000 by 1 the first number, and it maketh yet 5000. Now out of that 5000, you shall take the quadrat roote, which is 70. So 70 rankes of men shall your battell containe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> both in breadth and length; and there will remaine 100 men. For 70 multiplied into itselfe resulteth 4900, the which deducted out of 5000, there resteth 100 men, the which 100 men deuide by 70, so will there arise one more ranke of men, and yet will there remaine 30 men ouer, the which one ranke shall be ioyned vnto the 70 rankes aforesayd, so are they 71 in breadth and 70 in length: but to the end you may better vnderstand me, I will go shewing the same by figures, whereof this shall be the first.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="30"><FIGURE>

<P>And the 30 men which do remaine out of the body of the battell, they shall be reserued for other purposes.</P>
<P>And this square battell of number of men may be done in a more shorter and readier way,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A more exquisit way to frame any square battell of men.</HI> <GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> thus. Take the quadrat roote of 5000 simply, which is 70, and with this 70 deuide the 5000 men, so will there come 71 for the breadth of the bat|tel, and there will remaine 30 men. And thus your battell will containe 70 rankes in length, and 71 men <HI>per</HI> ranke in breadth, with 30 men remayning as afore|sayd. Now although the battell be more broade then long, or more men in front then in flanke by one ranke, yet is it neuerthelesse, after the order of warre, called a square battell of men.</P>
<P>The table drawne aforesayd for the proportion of equality, that is, that the battell do containe so many men in breadth as in length, shall serue also to shew the order which is to bee obserued in the battels that are to be be made of more men in front then in flanke, that is, in proportion of inequality, as hereafter I will shew you, giuing you to vnderstand that all the figures shall haue their <HI>scala</HI> de|uided into pases,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Geometricall scale. foote.</HI></NOTE> and euery geometricall pase into 5 foote, of the which measure of feete I haue here vnder set downe the fourth part, which is three inches, for that

euery foote is deuided into 12 inches, to the end you may conceiue what quantity of ground euery battell of pikes would require, allowing for euery mans station set in aray to fight, 3 foote in front, that is, from pouldron to pouldron, and 7 foote in flanke, that is 3 foote before, and 3 foote behind, for the vse of his weapon, and one foote for his owne station.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, there are few armies that haue scarse the one halfe of their pikemen armed with corslets, which is a great part of the strength and beauty of the battell, therefore we must seeke a course how to impale any battell with such armed pikes as they haue:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To empale the battell with your armed pikes the rule.</HI></NOTE> to do the which these rules following shall serue to impale any bat|tell, as well of proportion of inequality, as of equality, the foreward, the reareward, and the two flankes, with pikes and armed corslets. Now I suppose the whole num|ber of pikes to be 5000, as well armed as vnarmed, whereof there be 2000 armed pikes with corslets; the sayd 2000 I will repart into two equall parts, by 2, or taking the &frac12; of 2000, which is 1000: and with this 1000, will I impale the two flankes, and with the other 1000 will I arme the front and traine of the battell.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> Now first to arme the two flankes of the battell with 1000 armed pikes, I will deuide 1000 by 70, which is the depth or flanke of the battell, and the product will be 14 rankes of pikes to arme the flankes of the battell, with 20 pikes of surplussage: the 14 rankes shalbe halfed, or deuided into halues, which is 7 rankes; with the which 7 rankes I will arme the one side, and with the other 7 rankes the other side of the battell, or more or lesse vnto any side, as occasion or neede shall require: as in this figure following shall appeare.</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you shall know thus: deuide the breadth by the length, as to repart 71 by 70, the product is 1. And although that 1 do remaine of the breadth, yet it is called a square battell neuerthelesse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Captaine, I am well satisfied in vnderstanding the proportion that a battell hath in breadth to the length: but now would I gladly know how long and large is this square battell of men, I meane how much ground it will occupie?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>First you must vnderstand (as I told you before) that euery man martial|led in battell array to fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A rule to know what qua~titie of ground any bat|tell will require, each armed mans station 3 foote in breadth 7 foote for length.</HI> <GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> will require in his station, 3 foot of ground in breadth, that is from shoulder to shoulder, and 7 foote of ground for length, that is 3 foot for before him, 3 foote for behind him, and 1. foote of ground for his own station. This being noted: then must you multiplie the 71 rankes of men in front by 3 foote, and they will amount vnto 213 foote, and the 213 foote shall be deuided by 5 foote, accounting 5 foote to a pase, and the geometricall pase to conteine 2 or|dinary going steps or pases of a man: so will there come forth 42 pases and 3 foot. By this reckening will the battell conteine 42 pases and 3 foote.</P>
<P>And now to know the length thereof in ground, you shall multiplie the 70. rankes of length of the battell, by 7 foote, so will there come 490 foote, the which 490 foote you must deuide by 5 foote (which is a pase) &amp; there ariseth 98 pases; &amp; so doth the battell conteine in length 98 pases of ground. Thus the square battell of number of men commeth to conteine more ground in length then in breadth about 2&frac12; twise &amp; third, as you haue seene in the 3 and 4 figures of the square bat|tell of men. Thus you haue vnderstood of a battell, square of number of men, with their armed pikes in front, in traine, and the two flankes: which is in such order as the said battell should be framed vpon the point to fight.</P>

Now put the case, that you will frame a battell of proportion of inequalitie, which is of more men in breadth then in length, and that your number be 5000 men, of ar|med and vnarmed Pikes, as afore is sayd of the Square battell of men. And put the case that you will frame this battell &frac13; times more in breadth then in length (for this proportion is more vsed then any other in warres) for that this is the pro|portion which commeth to make a battell quadrat of ground, wherein most men are brought at once to fight in front. And to make this battell you shall take in the table 2 and &frac13; which is in proportion as 7 to 3: and these two numbers are to be set downe for the first, and second thing.

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Willingly, as farre as my small skill wil extend. Ther|fore touching the order of mar|ching, and out of the order of the said marching, to set a bat|tell with speed; I say that there are three manners obserued in the making therof: of the which before that I declare their or|ders one by one, I will with bre|uitie repeate all that which be|fore I shewed you.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Repetitions of the former.</HI></NOTE>I haue told you before, how to make the Calculation of battels, as well of the squares of men, as of Proportio~s of inequalitie, containing more men in breadth then length (termed by vs En|glishmen <HI>Bastard squares, Broade squares, and Base squares.</HI>) And I haue told you of the proportion of the breadth vnto the length: and moreouer, how brode and long will the said battels containe in ground: the which instructions will serue to frame any other battell, that may be more brode then long in any other propor|tion, with the helpe of the Tables which before I haue shewed you: for in the same may be found euerie proportion that shall be needfull, to frame any battell which may be more brode then long in number of men, or equall.</P>
<P>Now wil I shew you the maner how to frame a battell with speed; and this shal be by the instructions of the tables before giuen.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Out of</HI> 3 <HI>maner of marchings to frame a battell with speed. The first maner.</HI></NOTE> And this battell shal be speedily set after the order of the three maners of marching, as at the beginning I told you. The first maner is, when the companies do march with one part of the armed Pikes at the foreward, and an other part at the rereward of the vnarmed Pikes, as I will shew you in the tenth figure.</P>
<P>In this case, hauing the Table in memorie, onely there resteth to commit vnto two expert officers (as Caporals of the field, or such like) at the time of setting the battell, that the one go vnto the head and the other vnto the traine of the Orde|nances or Arrayes: and let him that stands at the head, cause or commaund to turne or wheele either from the right hand, or from the left (as shal be most con|uenient) 95 rankes, at 10 armed men per ranke, and hauing finished, to set the 95 rankes at 10 armed men <HI>per</HI> ranke, he shall cause them to turne their fa|ces from that part whither the Ordinances or Arrayes do looke, as you shal see designed in the eleuenth figure on the page next following.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="35"><FIGURE>

<P><PB N="62" REF="36">Then besides this, let him place 32 rankes of the arraies of the vnarmed pikes at the backes of the armed pikes, so many as they be rankes in length in the battell of the vnarmed pikes, as in the 8 table before figured appeareth; afterward let him go from hand to hand, drawing out of the arraies 32 rankes of vnarmed pikes, and set them one by another shoulder to shoulder, as I haue demonstrated in the 12 figure, and as I will shew you in this 13 figure.</P>

<P>This being done, let the

Officer of the Vanguarde draw out three rankes of the armed pikes, and arme the one flanke at 7 men in ranke; and he that is at the Reregard, let him take 3 ranke of his armed pikes, &amp; arme the other flanke, at 6 men in ranke, as in this fif|teenth figure appeareth.</P>

<P>And there will yet remaine 8 armed men, to place where you shall thinke good. Aduertising you, that if you should haue set the 72 armed men which be|fore remained, at the head or tayle of the battell, it would not haue reached vnto one whole or full ranke vnto the breadth of the battell: for an intire ranke of the
<PB N="65" REF="37">
inner part of the battell in breadth is 95 men, that is, so many as the breadth of the vnarmed pikes do containe. Thus the battell declared by the aforesayd 17 figure will be in length 46 rankes, at 108 men <HI>per</HI> ranke in breadth, with the 7 rankes of armed pikes in the front, and 7 rankes in the reareward, and with 8 men <HI>per</HI> ranke of armed pikes on the one flanke, and 7 men by ranke of armed pikes on the o|ther flanke, as in the aforesayd 17 figure appeareth, with the 8 men which remai|ned, placed in the body of the battell.</P>

<P>Assuredly (Captaine) this order seemeth wonderfull good. But now vnto the other two orders which you spake of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Touching the second maner of framing of battels. First the calculation or table of the battell must be had in memory (as before is sayd) in what proportion the said battell would be framed, and the army marching company by company, as I will shew you in the 18 figure: euery captaine shall be commanded by the Ser|geant maior, to make so many rankes of their pikes as the length of the battell shall containe, as in the 18 and 19 figures shall appeare. Now let vs suppose the sayd battell to containe in length 52 rankes, with 10 rankes of armed pikes at the head, and as many at the trayne, as is shewed in the declaration of the ninth and 14 figures, and that euery Captaine doe make 52 rankes, with 10 armed pikes before, and 10 behind, as in the 18 figure is shewed. And if a|ny Captaine be found which hath not to accomplish that number, let him ioyne with another Captaine, and betwixt them both let them make vp that number of 52 rankes. This being done, Captaine by Captaine shall set their rankes shoul|der to shoulder the one of the other, and shall so frame the battell 52 rankes in length, with 10 armed pikes by ranke before, and 10 behind. After that shall bee framed the battell, as I will shew you in this 20 figure following. This being done, one of the 4 Caporals of the field, shall go vnto the head, and another vnto the reareward: then he which is at the head, shall take away from the front of the battell 3 rankes of armed pikes, and arme therewith one of the flankes&punc; at 7 men <HI>per</HI> ranke in length, adioyning vnto them the 28 armed pikes, which he lacketh to furnish out the length of 46 rankes at 7 men <HI>per</HI> ranke, as is said in the declara|tion of the 9 figure.</P>
<P>And the other Caporall or officer, which is at the traine of the battell. He also shall take away or draw foorth from the traine 3 rankes of armed pikes, and arme with them the other side or flanke, at 6 men <HI>per</HI> ranke, in length of 46 rankes. So shall the battell bee formed 46 rankes long, at 108 men <HI>per</HI> ranke in front or breadth, with 7 ranks of armed pikes in fro~t, &amp; as many in traine, &amp; with 7 armed men <HI>per</HI> ranke on the one flanke, &amp; with 6 men by ranke, on the other flanke armed pikes: as I shewed in the 8 figure of the table and also in the 21 figure following.</P>
<P>And there will remaine out of the body of the battell 32 men, and they shall bee placed as I sayd in the last of the third order, at the beginning: moreouer there remaines 72 armed men.</P>
<P><HI>You must note and conceiue, that in the</HI> 18 <HI>figure, where the companies do march one after another by fiue in a ranke, and in the</HI> 19 <HI>figure, where they do come vp shoulder to shoulder to the framing of the battell, as may appeare, although the full number of companies do not there appeare, as is requisit: yet it is to be conceiued that they do consequently one follow another, but want of rome in paper cutteth them off.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="67" REF="38">And the 72 armed pikes remaining, which are of the number contained with|in the body of the battell, shall be placed either in the foure corners of the vnar|med pikes, as in the 16 figure may be seene; or else in each of the two sides or flankes, as in the 17 figure appeareth, where there is one ranke adioyned vnto the one flanke, and another vnto the other flanke; or else you may arme and strength with the same 72 armed pikes, any one of the flankes, as neede or occasion shall require.</P>

<P>You haue described the first and second order of imbattailing excellent well, in mine opinion, therefore (I pray) proceede to the third.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>The maner of the third order is thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The third order by marching ma|niple by maniple.</HI></NOTE> When the armie is caused to march <HI>Maniple</HI> by <HI>Maniple,</HI> with their armed pikes in vantgard and rearegard of euery particular <HI>Maniples</HI>; and with one <HI>Maniple</HI> all of armed pikes, which mar|cheth in the vantgard of the <HI>Maniples</HI> which haue their vnarmed pikes in their middle or center: the which <HI>Maniples</HI> of all armed pikes, is that which serueth to arme the one flanke of the battell. Besides this, there marcheth another <HI>Maniple</HI> of all armed pikes, after all the <HI>Maniples</HI>; and this <HI>Maniple</HI> serueth to arme the o|ther flanke of the battell. And the <HI>Maniples</HI> must march the one after the other, as in the figure appeareth.</P>
<P>Now, there resteth how to bring those into <HI>Maniples</HI> of this last order, which do march in the full length of the battell, with their armed pikes in front and traine; the which shalbe done in this sort. Let it be supposed (as the 17 figure of the second order doth shew) that there shall be drawne foorth 15 men in ranke of armed pikes in length of the battel, which serue to arme the two flanks, out of 108 men <HI>per</HI> ranke, the breadth of the battell, there resteth 93 men <HI>per</HI> ranke for breadth or front. And these 93 must be diuided into so manie parts, as one would that the <HI>Maniples</HI> should march in ordinance or arraies, the one after another, as the way will permit.</P>
<P>Now say that I will haue the <HI>Maniples</HI> to march by 5 in a ranke, then must I deuide the 93 (the breadth of the battell) by 5, whereof commeth <HI>Maniples</HI> 18, which shall containe in length rankes 46 at 5 men in a ranke; and one <HI>Maniple</HI> remaining at 3 men <HI>per</HI> ranke; the which <HI>Maniple</HI> is also 46 rankes in length, at 3 men in rankes. Notwithstanding it shall march (in marching) at 5 men in ranke after all the <HI>Maniples</HI> aforesayd. And the 18 <HI>Maniples</HI> doe march with 7 rankes of armed pikes before, and 7 rankes after: and the <HI>Maniple</HI> of 3 <HI>per</HI> ranke, shall, at the time of setting the battell, distend to the shoulders of the o|ther <HI>Maniples</HI> at 3 <HI>per</HI> ranke, with 7 rankes, armed pikes in front, and 7 rankes ar|med pikes in trayne. And the other two <HI>Maniples</HI> of armed pikes, which serue to arme the two flankes, the one marcheth in the vantgard, and the other in the reare|ward of the <HI>Maniples</HI> which haue their vnarmed pikes in the middle (yet at 5 in ranke) as appeareth in the 22 figure, and at the instant that the battell is to be set, the Sergeant Maior shall accommodate and fasten the <HI>Maniples</HI> of all armed pikes, that marcheth in the foreward of all the <HI>Maniples,</HI> into 46 rankes, at 8 men armed <HI>per</HI> ranke, and the other <HI>Maniples</HI> shall follow from hand to hand, poul|dron to pouldron, the one to the other, as the 23 figure and 24 declareth, begin|ning with the armed <HI>Maniple,</HI> which armeth the flanke at 8 men in ranke by length. These <HI>Maniples</HI> thus brought shoulder to shoulder, one to the other, then
<FIGURE>
<PB N="68" REF="39">
</FIGURE>
<PB N="69" REF="39">
shall follow that <HI>Maniple</HI> of and <HI>per</HI> ranke (the which yet marcheth at 5 <HI>per</HI> ranke in array) and shall distend vnto the shoulders of the other <HI>Maniple,</HI> at 3 <HI>per</HI> ranke, with 7 armed pikes in front, and 7 in traine. After all this shall follow the other <HI>Maniple</HI> of all armed pikes, and shall stretch foorth vnto 7 in a ranke vnto the shoulder of the other <HI>Maniples,</HI> to arme the other flanke of the battell. And thus is the battel framed 46 rankes in length, at 108 men by ranke in breadth, with 7 rankes of armed pikes in front, and 7 in traine, and with 8 armed pikes in ranke, on the one flanke, and 7 in a ranke on the other flanke, of armed pikes, as in the 24 and 25 figures: and there remaines 32 armed pikes, the which shall be pla|ced as I said before, in the last maner of the third order.</P>
<P>Aduertising you,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aduertisement.</HI></NOTE> that although I haue giuen order and examples to arme the front, traine, and both flankes of the battell, in forme and manner as I haue set downe in the 24 and 25 figures, with placing the armed pikes which remained out of them which armed the front, traine, and both the flankes of the battell, in the angles &amp; flankes of the sayd battell, as by their seuerall figures may be seene; yet, notwithstanding the aforesayd examples, they may be placed where most neede and occasion shall serue to strengthen the battell, either in front, in traine, or in any flanke. So may you also, as occasion shall require, set more armed pikes vpon any part, for the more strength and securitie of the battell. And this much may suffice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fierie weapons.</HI></NOTE> touching the body of a formed battell.

<P>As the armed pike is the stre~gth of the battell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The armed pike is the strength of the battell, so is the shot the furie of the field. Shot and pikes of necessitie to be coupled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The one without the other of no great force.</HI></P></NOTE> so without question, is the shot the furie of the field: but the one without the other is weakened the better halfe of their strength. Therefore of necessitie (according to the course of warres in these dayes) the one is to be coupled &amp; matched with the other, in such conue|nient proportion, that the aduantage of the one may helpe the disauantage of the other. For a stand of pikes, though neuer so well armed, being charged &amp; assailed with the like, or a lesse number of shot, by euery mans iudgement would haue the worse, &amp; not able to abide the field, vnlesse they had shot, to answer their enemies shot. In like sort, any troupe of shot, though neuer so braue &amp; expert, being in o|pen field, hauing no stand of pikes, or such other weapo~, nor hedge, ditch, trench, or rampier, to relieue and succour them, could not long endure the force of horse, especially Launciers.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The sortement of these weapons, offensiue and de|fensiue.</HI></NOTE> Now the due sortement and matching of these weapons to offend, and defend, and to aide one another, as aboue is sayd, of the best experi|mented is accounted thus: Vnto euery 100 men, to haue one third pikes (with some few short weapon) and two thirds Calliuers.</P>
<P>But were the one halfe (or more) of your shot, Muskets, as the <HI>Spanyardes</HI> most commonly now vse, and so to be wished with vs also, then lesse number of shot would serue and more of pikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The aduantage of musket.</HI></NOTE> (as I sayd at the beginning of our discourses.) For euery Musket, considering the wonderfull execution of that weapon, may be va|lued for two Caliuers. Touching the placing of these fierie weapons about the body of the battell, there hath bene, and yet is, sundry opinions. Of some of them I haue already spoken in these discourses, namely, of lyning of battels with shot, or short weapon, by me disliked; hauing there declared my reasons for the same.</P>
<P>But before I come to the placing and ordering of shot (for being a weapon not skilfully and warily vsed, is of more daunger to our selues then to the enemy
<PB N="70" REF="40">
sometimes) I will put you in minde of one notable ouersight in our shot (espe|cially of the crooked stockt Calliuer;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>notable ouer|sight of our shot in charging and discharging their peeces.</HI></NOTE>) For many souldiers ouer-curiously carrying and conueying their peece with the nose downeward, and striuing to be seene nymble and quicke in discharging, (not considering that one shot well bestowed, auayleth many vnaduisedly spent,) haue let slipt the bullet out of their peeces bar|rell vpon the ground, before the discharging thereof. Whereby it commeth to passe many times, that an hundred shot, hauing in skirmish discharged their peece three or foure times a peece, against two hundred of the enemies, and scarce slaine two of them. A great indiscretion, &amp; to be better regarded and amended; the which may easily be done thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A redresse and easie way, how to fasten the bullet.</HI></NOTE> either after hauing charged and slipt the bul|let out of his mouth into the barrell of the peece, by mounting the nose thereof somewhat vpward, holding his peece firmely with his left hand, or else by stop|ping after the bullet, which is easily done, onely by putting two or three cornes of powder into the peece after the bullet.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How some do vse to place their shot about the battell of pikes.</HI></NOTE>In placing the shot about the battell, some do vse to flanke the two sides of the battell with sleeues of shot, by 11, 13, 15, or 17 in a ranke, or more or lesse, as they shall thinke good; and place the sayd sleeues of shot, 10 or 12 foote distant from the armed pikes; and the rest of their shot in 4 great troupes at the angles of the battell, without the sayd sleeues, seruing for hornes or wings vnto the battell, and the horsemen to be placed without them againe, as in these figures follow|ing appeareth.</P>

First, your graund square (or more battailions if you will) being set,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To girdle the sta~d of pikes with shot.</HI></NOTE> then impale or girdle the same round about with shot, by 3, 5, or 7, or more, in a rank (according to the proportio~ of the battell, neare adioyning vnto the armed pikes, to be by them guarded from the

<P>The empalement, especially in the front, I would wish to be Muskets, some 3 or 5 in a ranke, according to the greatnesse of the battell; and those not to dis|charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The girdling shot to discharge at</HI> 20 <HI>pases<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ff, and not farther.</HI></NOTE> vntill the battels approch within 20 pases distant, and then throughly to discharge in vollie vpon the face of the enemy: the which cannot chuse, but must slay many, and wound a number in the enemies front; the effect whereof shall breede great encouragement vnto you, and disencouragement, and weakening to the enemy. You may also (if you please) place at euery corner of your battel a squa|dron of Muskets, neare vnto the girdling shot, at 50 Muskets in each squadron, or as occasion shall require; who, vpon the enemies battell approching, wheeling a litle about, in forme of a halfe Moone, shall discharge their volly all at once, vpon the body of the enemies battell. What execution the Musket performeth, such as haue bene in good actions doe know very well; and scarcely to be beleeued of those which neuer saw any seruice.

<P>Truly, for mine owne part I haue litle skill to iudge, but in mine opinion, this seemeth wonderfull strong for one battell: but me thinkes, you haue framed your battell of more men in breadth then in length.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The broad square battell bring the most hands at once to fight in front.</HI></NOTE> For I haue set 108 men in breadth, and 46 rankes in length: the reasons thereof I shewed you before: for by this meanes there commeth more hands at once to fight in front, and the flankes notwithstanding sufficient strong, especially hauing any aduantage by the seat, which battell commeth to be an e|quall square of ground, and a broad square of men, in proportion of inequalitie, as 7 is to 3,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The square of ground.</HI></NOTE> that is two times, and a third of men more broad then long.</P>
<P>But for these formes of battels, as they bring most hands to fight at once; so are they not equally strong on each side, as is the iust square of men: wherefore it behoueth the leaders thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A care to be had to the situation of ground.</HI></NOTE> to haue a care to the situation of the ground, and to procure (as neere as they can) that the enemie may charge but in the front, so shall they be wonderfull strong either against horse or foote.

<P><HI>So is it dangerous for vnexpert men to fight in sundry battallions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Men come not often to hand blowes, as in old time, the shot so imployeth the field.</HI></P></NOTE> and with great reason and aduauntage, were men experte and skilfull. For as it is venturous to set ones fortune vpon the brunt of one sole bat|tell, so is it daungerous to frame many batallions, except men be very skilfull and well practised therein, by reason of the difficultie in seconding one another. And againe it is rarely seene in our dayes, that men come often to hand-blowes, as in old time they did: For now in this age, the shot so employeth and busieth the field (being well backed with a resolute stand of pikes) that the most valiantest and skilfullest therein do commonly import the victorie, or the best, at the least wise, before men come to many hand-blowes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Although I haue before somwhat touched the same, not minding to medle farther then with our fights now most accustomed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The iust square of men best al|lowed, out of the which all other proportions may be reduced.</HI></NOTE> yet neuerthelesse drawen on by your good and curious demaundes, I will, the best I can, particular|ly describe them. Therefore, as I haue before declared of all formes of battels now in our age most in vse, best approued, and best allowed of, is the iust square
<PB N="77" REF="43">
of men, as equally strong on euery side, and most fit, and best assured for the open field; and out of which quadrate all other formes may easily be reduced. Next vn|to that,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The quadrat of ground.</HI></NOTE> and most aduantagious (indeede) to fight, is the quadrate of ground by good regard had, wherein many hands are brought at one time to fight. Of both the which formes I haue before largely discoursed, as well the manner how to frame them, as their due sortement with weapons, and shot to the same; I will now speake somewhat of the rest, of the which there are many sorts seruing in old time vnto many purposes (but now with vs quite out of vse) as the <HI>Diamant battell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sundry ancient formes of battels now out of vse.</HI></NOTE> <HI>the VVedge battell or Triangle, the Sheers battell, the Saw battell, the Moone battell, the S+DG battels</HI> and the <HI>Crosse battell,</HI> with such like, and chiefly the <HI>battell compounded of sundrie battallions</HI>; the which last recited, of all others, I thinke to be the most strong and aduantagious,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The daunger of raw men,</HI></NOTE> were men expert, skilfull, and ready: but raw, as in our dayes they be, very difficult and dangerous to be handled.</P>
<P>The nearest therefore vnto the square of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The Diamant battell.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The framing thereof out of the graund square.</HI></P></NOTE> is the Diamant battell; vnto the framing whereof, out of the said square, there needeth no more, but whereas the leader stood before on the square of the battell, let him appoint another to go to the next corner or angle thereof, and willing the pikes to turne their faces vpon him, and they shall straight, out of the square, march into a Diamant proportion: which forme when you are disposed to alter, do no more but appoint the leader to the square, where he first stood, commaunding the pikes to turne their faces v|pon him, and they shall forthwith march into a square battell againe. The facili|tie is great both herein and in all others, and that without any confusion, as by their seuerall figures following shall appeare; the which I haue framed of 25 let|ters, the better to giue you to vnderstand.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>And againe out of the Diamant forme may be reduced two triangles, by cut|ting or diuiding the same in the middest at the two flat angles, as in this figure of a Diamant forme may appeare by the prickes running along: &amp; of 2 triangles may be framed a Sheeres battell and of 3 or 4 triangles may in like sort be framed the Saw battell, by ioyning the angles together as in their figures following shall ap|peare.</P>
<P>Here you see the square reduced into a Diamant forme, with onely turning their faces vnto the right angle <HI>E,</HI> as aboue appeareth, &amp; so marching on, do fall into a perfect Diamant forme, with two sharpe angles, and two flat. But in their march they will stretch ouer-long, each man from his leadesman, so will it be of

no force to fight, by reason of their raritie &amp; thin standing, as in the former figure may appeare by <HI>F.B.</HI> &amp; by <HI>L.G.C.</HI> &amp; by <HI>G.M.H.D.</HI> &amp; by <HI>VV.R.N.N.E,</HI> the two sharp angles;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A more stronger framin of the Diamant battell.</HI></NOTE> and so of the rest.

<P>Here haue you seene, how out of a square of men hath bin first reduced a Dia|mant battell simple; and out of the Diamant a triangle or wedge battell in perfect order to fight, which is with 1. man in the first ranke, 3 in the second, and 5 in the third ranke, &amp; so consequently augmenting 2 in euery ranke, with the Ensigne in the middest. Now, by this order out of 2 iust squares of men, are reduced 2 trian|gles; and of two perfect Triangles,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Out of 2 iust squares of men is framed 2 trian|gles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of 2 triangles is framed a Dia|mant.</HI></P></NOTE> is formed a Perfect Diamant battel, by ioyning the two rereward parts together. But first out of the one Triangle must be drawen the last ranke of all, the which may be placed at the latter point of the Diamant battell, or else as the Sergea~t Maior shall thinke good. The figures of both which squadrons reduced into Diamant formes, and from Diamants into 2 Triangles, lastly adioyning the 2 Triangle backe parts together, is formed a perfect Diamant battell fit to fight; as by their seuerall figures here following may be seene.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="44"><FIGURE>

<P>These two squadrons shal be reduced into 2 triangles, in manner as aforesaid, which will be in forme following.</P>

</FIGURE><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The triangle.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In these 6 former figures, I haue declared the order how, out of 2 squadrons of men, to bring them into 2 Diamant formes simple, and out of 2 Diamant formes single, to reduce them into 2 perfect Triangles, by causing all their middle ranks to march vp, vntill they find their leadsman before them in their due distance: the which 2 Triangles, being thus perfected (as in the 4 and 5 figure may appeare) and ioyning the two backe parts together, do make this perfect Diamant forme to fight, as here by the 2 figures following shall appeare. But of the second fi|gure
<PB N="80" REF="45">
I haue drawen the latter ranke of one of the Triangles, being nine men, and placed them at one of the corners.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Now, touching the Sheeres battell, the same is to be made of 4 battallions of equal proportio~, working, as before you did with the Diamant &amp; Triangle battels: the which 4 battallions being reduced (as before is sayd) into 2 triangles, and ioy|ning their two corners together, is framed the Sheeres battell, as here you see.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sheeres bat|tell.</HI></NOTE><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Loe here the Sheere battell framed of 4 battallions; to backe the which you must draw vp 2, 3 or 4 rankes of pikes according to the proportion of the battell, and place them on the backe part thereof, as you see aboue designed by this let|ter <HI>O,</HI> where I haue backed the same with 2 rankes, at 18 men in a ranke. And also the same order is to be obserued in the Saw battell, as after appeareth. Next is the Saw battell, which containeth 3 sharpe angles framed of 6 battallions, in such order as the Wedge, &amp; Sheeres battels before wrought, as here in the figure fol|lowing is designed.</P>

<P>Now, there haue I spent more time in those trifling formes and vnused propor|tions then I needed, but only to giue you content, and to the end to shew, that he, which is a Sergeant Maior,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Sergeant ma|ior ought not to be ignorant of any formes of embattailing as well ancient as moderne.</HI></NOTE> ought not to be ignorant in any manner of proporti|ons, as well ancient as moderne; whereby he may be both able, skilfull and ready to frame, alter, and change his proportions, as occasion shall be offered, and that with facilitie and speed.</P>

It is commonly framed of 5 battallions or squadrons, 4 in crosse wise, and one in the middle: the which middle battallion may conteine your Ensignes and short weapons: but if it be framed of 4 battallions, with the center vnfilled, then may the center containe the impedimentes and baggage of the armie.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vantgard.</HI></NOTE>The first or vantgard of the 11000 pikes reparted into 3 battels, contai|neth 4900 piquiers, whose square roote is 70, which is 70 rankes, and 70 men <HI>per</HI> ranke, or 70 in front, and 70 in flanke, or 70 ranks and 70 files: all which is all one. In the second of those 3 battels, distinguished by name of battell, is contained 3969 pikes whose square roote is 63 containing so many men in front and flanke.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Battell.</HI></NOTE> the third of those battels, tearmed by the name of reareward, doth con|taine 1936 pikes, Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reareward</HI></NOTE> the cubike roote whereof is 44, and so many it containeth in front and flanke: being all square battels of men.</P>
<P>Now in the marching of these battels vp to fight, there is great and many con|siderations to be had;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Many considera|tions in bringing men to fight.</HI></NOTE> both for the wind, the sunne, and aduantage of ground, and also the quantity and quality of the enemy: as whether he do exceede more in foote, then in horse; and also their maner and forme of embattailing. All which considerations, and many more, must proceede from the good capacity, sound in|tendement, and militarie skill of our Generall, and other commanders of our ar|my; vnto whom if it shall so seeme necessary, and occasion so require, first to leade the va~tgard alone to fight, the same is afterward to be seconded by the battel, mar|ching vp by the right or left flanke of the vantgard, and ioyning with whom, may renew the fight a fresh. And then if it fall out, that they should be againe distres|sed, the rereward is then to march vp vpon either the right or left side, as cause shall most require, and so ioyning with the other two, to renew againe their en|counter and fight, wherein both skill valour, and vertue must be shewed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A consideration.</HI></NOTE>And whereas I haue in those battels proportioned 70 men to the depth of the vangard, and but 63 to the battell, and 44 to the rereward, the which drawne
<PB N="85" REF="47">
vp together in that proportion should badly correspond by reason of their diffe|rent depthes, or flankes; it must be therefore considered, that the first shocke and brunt is commonly the hardest, and no doubt but many men of the first ranks must fall at their seuerall encounters: and comming so to passe (as of necessity it would) then these different proportions should soone come to be different; as a|ny iudicious men may conceiue.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A declaration of the</HI> 9 <HI>battallions.</HI></NOTE> the said number of the 3 battels are deuided into 9 battallions of the same kind and nature that their grand battels were of, whereof there is made 3 fronts, in the first front is contained 4 battallions or squadrons, with their seue|rall spaces betwixt. The second front or supply is framed of 3 battallions, with their seuerall spaces betwixt. And the third front or last hope and succour con|taineth 2 battallions. The which 2 battallions I haue placed vpon the two out angles of the 3 middle battallions; and in the voide spaces betwixt, is placed the impediments and baggage of the army. The seuerall breadth, depthes, and num|bers of euery of these battallions, are set downe in their seuerall figures.</P>

At which retiring the Battallions of the second front, are to aduance fore|ward, and to passe in betwixt the voide spaces of the first 4 battallions, and so all ioyning valiantly together with the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sundry charges and fresh heads.</HI></NOTE> to make a fresh head, and to begin a se|cond fight. And being then againe distressed, they are all orderly to retire, as is sayd. Then lastly the two battallions of the 3 front, are to aduance the one vp by the one side of the other battallions, and the other vp by the other side of them; or as occasion shall most require: and then finally all ioyntly together to giue a third and finall fight. By which order it should seeme, fortune to abandon them thrice before that they should be quighte vanquished.</P>
<P>And last of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A declaration of the</HI> 12 <HI>battal|lions.</HI></NOTE> the former 3 battels are reparted into 12 battallions of the same kind, distinguished into 3 fronts.

The second front is framed of 4 battallions, of 961 men each, whose square roote is still 31, with seuerall spaces betwixt euery battallion. And the third front is formed of 3 battailions, containing in each 625 men, whose square roote is 25 for front and flanke.

And the voide spaces betwixt the battallions are to containe in breadth as much as do the bat|tallions of the second front, within the which they are to aduance and passe: so is it easily to be calculated, what quantity of ground such order of battels and bat|tallions will require. Moreouer it must be considered, that there must be a con|uenient space of ground remaine betweene the traine of the first order of bat|tallions, and the front of the second order, and in like sort from the traine of the second order, vnto the front of the third<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> order: as some 20, or 25 pases betwixt each, or such as the ground will permit, or occasion require.</P>

<P>The Generall his place, is commonly in the space vpon the front of the second order of the battallions:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Generall his place.</HI></NOTE> from whence he may most conueniently send his directi|ons and orders: to do the which, besides the Campe-maister and Sergeant Maior Generall, &amp; his Trumpet, and chiefe Drummer, he is to haue attendant vpon him certaine expert gentlemen both on horsebacke and on foote.</P>
<P>The Colonels of euery foote regiment, are with their companies to serue on foote, being arraunged to fight: their due place is the right angle of the first ranke of their squadro~s,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Colonels.</HI></NOTE> &amp; their Lieutenants in the left angle of the same ranks, the Cap|taines and other inferiour officers, in ranke also, as their place requireth; as more at large in their seuerall duties is declared.</P>
<P>But in case that a Colonell were in any peece of seruice with his regiment a|lone, then is hee to employ the place and office of a Generall, for the present ser|uice. The Ensignes are to be placed in the centre, or neare the center, towards the formost rankes of euery battell or battallion, and to stand in ranke also. Finally of these 12000 pikes and short weapon, there is reserued out, about 1000 to serue to other purposes: as to gard the artillery, munition, and impediments, and such other peeces of seruice.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you wold haue all your army deuided into battallions or squadrons of that kind, then are the Colonels of euery particular regiment, to cause the com|panies of their regiment to embattel themselues, vpon a sound of the drumme, in such smal battallions or squadrons of 100 pikes, in euery squadron 10 in front, and 10 deepe, as in folio 38, 39, and 4 may appeare.</P>
<P>And suppose that the 24000 footmen were reparted into 20 regiments, after 1200 into euery regiment: of the which 1200 men there is 600 picquiers, those 600 picquiers are to be embattailed into 6 small squadrons of 100 in each squa|dron, at 10 in front and 10 deepe. Being thus embattailed into sundry small squa|drons of one kind, they may with great facility be brought into any proportion you will, as by these figures following may appeare. Where you see embattailed the picquiers of three regiments seueral into their smal squadrons, of 100 in each squadron, at 10 in front, and 10 deepe, all in one front.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="49">In the first figure you may behold 3 regiments embattailed into 18 small squa|drons; in the second figure behold the same reduced into a battell of double front, or into a due square of ground, which is twice so many men in front as in flanke: and in the 3 figure, you may see the said 3 regiments brought into a iust square of men; that is, as many men in breadth as in depth: the order whereof is thus.</P>
<P>The first regiment being embattailed into 6 small squadrons, and placed in one equall front, the second regiment (being embattailed in the like maner) is to march vp vnto the traine of the first 6 squadrons, there ioyning squadron with squadron, and answering file with file. After them againe is the other last 6 squa|drons to march vp vnto the traine of those 6 middle squadrons, and placed euen squadron with squadron and file with file: so that of these three regiments there is made one body of a battell of broade front, or due square of ground, which is twice so many men in breadth as in depth, as by the second figure may appeare.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The order.</HI></NOTE>Finally, if you shold be occasioned to reduce the said three regiments into one grand battell of equall proportion, or due square of men: then place 4 of these small squadrons in one front, on whose traine 4 other squadrons, are to march vp; and then againe 4 others, and lastly the last foure squadrons; so that squadron with squadron, and file with file, may equally answere one another, as in the third figure may appeare. Where, of 16 of these small squadrons is framed a battell in proportion of equality: which is so many men in depth as in front: and there re|maineth out two small squadrons, the which are to serue to other purposes, either for a supplie, or to other seruices.</P>

<P>By describing vnto vs these seuerall orders of reparting an army into sun|dry battallions &amp; squadrons, ye haue contented vs wonderfull well: &amp; it seemeth (in mine opinion) much aduantagious, being discretly and orderly handled. But how should the shot, due vnto those regiments, be placed and ordered?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>The shot belonging vnto these regiments, deuided into sundry battels, battallions and squadrons, should be reparted into sundry small troupes, of 50 in each troupe, at 5 in front, and 10 in depth, or more, or lesse, as occasion shall pro|cure; the ordering and placing of which shot doth appeare, in folio 42 43, &amp; 73, &amp; is in many other places described; so that one troupe may alwayes be ready to se|cond another, and to giue breathing one to another.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what haue you next to speake more of, before you returne to the office of the Sergeant Maior: by reason of whose office you haue made these sun|dry demonstrations of diuerse and many sorts of battels, and battallions, as a mat|ter most pertinent vnto the said Sergeant Maior his office.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should now set downe the tables of all these sundry proportions: as first of battels in proportion of equality;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of tables to be framed.</HI></NOTE> which is the iust square of men; their order of ranking; their deuiding into <HI>Maniples,</HI> and so marching vp shoulder to shoul|der, to bring them into their former order of battell, with the marching vp of
<PB N="89" REF="49">
their remainers: their due numbers of girdling shot, and the deuiding of the said battels into sundry battallions of the same kind: then againe, the tables of battels in proportion of inequalitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euen.</HI></NOTE> which is more in breadth then depth: with their de|uisions into battallions of that sort, and the table of euen battallions for crosse battels, and of other proportions, with the quantity of ground that euery of them would require; but time permitteth me not: reseruing the same vnto the last booke of these our military discourses.</P>
<P>But I must now speake something by the way, of marching our battell through straightes, and being passed, how to fall againe into the former pro|portions.</P>
<P>When you come to any straight,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To march an ar|my thorough straightes.</HI></NOTE> it must be considered of what widenesse the passages are, and how many men may go in front easily thorow the same; and then may you accordingly, at your discretion, chuse whether you will draw your battell out into the former <HI>Maniples,</HI> that the same marched in before their com|ming into battell (as in the seuerall tables thereof shall be shewed) or into more <HI>Maniples</HI> or parts, if thereunto you shall be compelled by the narrownesse of the place:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Drawne into Maniples.</HI></NOTE> which likewise being so wide, that fewer <HI>Maniples</HI> then you marched vp before, will serue for their diuision, you may accordingly also draw them out into 3, 5, 7, or 9, <HI>Maniples,</HI> as the nature of the straight, and your iudgement con|curring together shall thinke meete.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Ensigne to be contained in the middle Maniple.</HI></NOTE> Alwayes prouided, that the ensignes be contained in the middle <HI>Maniple</HI>: and hauing passed the straightes, you may a|gaine draw them vp shoulder to shoulder, as in the order of marching in <HI>Mani|ples,</HI> is before in folio 62, 63, 66, and 68 declared; whereby easily and without con|fusion they shall foorthwith fall in their former proportion. But as concerning your shot,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The shot, in troupes most ser|uiceable.</HI></NOTE> you shall not neede (except the straight be very narrow) to draw them out into any such parts, without it be those in the girdling, which as they stand in proportion in the battell, must be drawne out into <HI>Maniples</HI> with the pikes, for if mine opinion might be receiued touching the other shot, I would alwayes aduise, that the residue should euer more remaine in many small troupes, not aboue 40, or 50 shot, at the most in a troupe, as before I haue shewed, for that by experience I know the same to be of greatest force, and readinesse for seruice: be it therefore in plaine or straight, or how soeuer, the more troupes your shot be seuered into, the better shall the enemy still be applied;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The one to second another.</HI></NOTE> besides the seconding the one of the o|ther with such quicke dispatch, shall cause that after the first troupes haue once discharged, they retiring themselues behind all the rest, shall be sure against they come vp againe to haue leasure enough to charge sufficiently and surely, that few shot shall be spent in vaine, as they do when great numbers be clustred together.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>If the enemy co~|straine to fight in the straight them to quarter your Army.</HI></NOTE> if it should fortune (as most commonly it chaunceth) that the enemy should fight with you in the straight, then must you not draw your battell into those <HI>Maniples</HI> or parts, but consider whether the straight be such, as will suffice you to go thorough, holding the same proportion that you haue. If not, then con|sider whether squaring the battell into 4 parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To quarter the battell into sun|dry battallions.</HI></NOTE> you may with so many battallions passe to encounter with the enemy, if so you cannot, it seemeth vnto me the redi|est and safest way, to deuide your battell into more battallions, as for example: first to proportion them out into 4 or 6, if those bee not conuenient, then into 8, if you
<PB N="90" REF="50">
thinke that will not serue, then into 12 or 16 battallions, or as the passage will permit, which thing may more easily be brought to passe, if the body of your bat|tell do consist of pikes only, which, were the same of compound weapons, could in no wise bee so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">odainely done, without great confusion; as a man of any iudgement may conceiue: and as by these figures following shall plainely appeare.</P>

By whose hand and industrie, the Camp-maister or Colo|nell, doth giue and appoint the orders conuenient to the due gouernement of his Regiment or Armie: as in marching, in encamping, and imbattailing, and in such other matters concerning hereunto: whereby may be gathered the partes, the qualities, the valour, the great skill, experience and diligence, which ought to be in him, who is chosen to this degree of office; being of such importance, that in
<PB N="93" REF="51">
the time of the <HI>Greekes</HI> and <HI>Romaines,</HI> this office was credited vnto none; but the Generals them selues did execute the same in their owne person.</P>

<P>You said that the office of the Sergeant Maior did co~sist in three things; that is, in the good order of marching, in the sure manner of encamping, and in the perfect formes of imbattailing: wherefore I pray discourse more at large thereof vnto vs.</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly (Gentlemen) if you remember, I haue before at large declared touching the embattailing of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>To k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w to frame his squa|dron, to march with the same, to bring the~ to fight. A squadro~ what it is.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The armie b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st ordered and di|sciplined, is like to be Lord of the victorie.</HI></P></NOTE> the ordering of squadrons, their deuiding in|to <HI>Maniples,</HI> and the formes of sundry kinde of battels with vs most in vse: but yet to giue you content, I will repeate some part thereof againe. Wherefore it concerneth this officer to know how to frame his squadrons, to march with the same, and bring them to fight. Now, <HI>a squadron of men is,</HI> (as before I sayd in folio 45.) <HI>A congregatio~ of souldiers orderly ranged &amp; set, by the which is pretended to giue vnto euery one such place and roome, as they may fight without hindering one another, and to vnite all their forces together, in such sort that they may attaine to their prin|cipall intents and end, which is to be victorious or inuincible.</HI> So that we ought to thinke that the armie which is best ordered and disciplined, although of lesser
<PB N="94" REF="52">
numbers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vegetius his rea|sons.</HI></NOTE> is like to be, by all reason, Lord of the victorie: as <HI>Vegetius</HI> declareth ve|ry well, giuing the reason why the ancient <HI>Romanes</HI> became conquerours of most nations of the world; saying that in greatnesse they were not like to the <HI>Almaines,</HI> neither comparable in number to the <HI>French,</HI> neither so subtill as the <HI>Aphricanes,</HI> nor so strong as the <HI>Spanyardes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The aduantage of practise and good discipline.</HI></NOTE> nor so furious as the <HI>Brittanes,</HI> nor so wise as the <HI>Grecians,</HI> yet did they make easie, and answer all these disaduantages and difficul|ties, by onely maintaining their people well exercised in armes, and practise of warre, and keeping them well disciplined and reformed in manners. And for as much as squadrons and battels be formed of numbers of souldiers, more or lesse, according to the greatnesse of the armie, it is necessarie that this officer doe per|fectly know,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>It is necessarie to haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n writing the iust number of euery companie and their sortme~t of weapons.

To do the which, it is most needefull that he be very skilfull in <HI>Arithmetike,</HI> for without the same, he should hardly performe his office: and not onely to know how to embattell the companies of his owne Regiment, but of many Regiments together, and of any number:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A battell framed of sundrie Ter|tios by the Duke de Alua at Lis|bona. The Tertios of Naples, Sicilia &amp; Lombardie.

And for as much as the Sergeant Maior was not very skilfull and ready herein,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sergeant Maior by want of skill, much puzzeled.</HI></NOTE> they found them selues much puzzelled in doing thereof; and fell into many faultes, in presence of their Generall and Princes: and in generall iudgement of the whole Campe wherein I then serued.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly it was a matter well worth the noting, but is there more sortes of imbattailing then those you haue spoken of before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I haue already spoken of the most; yet of diuerse nations vsed diuersely; of all which formes I would haue the Sergeant Maior to be skilled and seene, al|though the conduction of our warres now a dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Our warres now a dayes do consist more in surprises, as|saults, and batte|ries, then in main fight.</HI></NOTE> doth consist more in surpri|ses, assaults, and batteries, then open field fight, and although the best now in vse, are but two or three, <HI>viz.</HI> the first square of men, and the square of ground, and their diuision into battallions of that kind, according to the weapons wherewith|all we now fight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>

For in some oc|casions the square of men would be best, as in open field, without aduantage of hedge, ditch, water, marish or wood, or where the enemie is strong in horse, to charge on euerie side: the which iust square of men, in euerie part is found to be

<P>The Bastard square,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What is mea~t by bastard square, broad square, &amp; base square.</HI></NOTE> is the battell which conteineth almost twise so many men in front, as in flanke, in proportion as 1 &frac34; is to 1: the Broad square is the bat|tell which conteineth more, or as much, as twise so many men in front, as in flank, as is 2 to 1, or 2 &frac13;, which is as 7 to 3: and the Base square, is the battell which con|taineth almost thrise, or 3 times more in breadth then in depth, which proportion is as 8 to 2, or 3 to 1, or such other proportions of inequalitie, as fol. 51.</P>

<P>You haue before declared at large the maner how to frame all these sorts of battels: therfore it is needelesse to demaund it againe; whereby I perceiue how necessary it is for the Sergeant Maior to be both learned and skilfull in Arithme|ticke: but doth it import any thing, whether the ranks be of eue~ number or odde?</P>

<P>But the battell or squadron of pikes being set, in what order is the same garnished with shot, and how many and great shall the sleeues thereof be, and how farre distant placed from the pikes? for I haue heard different opinions therein; whereof, although you haue sayd somwhat already, yet I pray, let vs heare something more of the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No souldier is ignorant, that the squadron of pikes being set, is to be impaled or girdled with shot,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &amp; natu|rall girdling with shot.</HI></NOTE> as many rankes of shot, as pikes. But the due and naturall girdling indeede, ought to be no more shot in ranke, then that the pike may well couer and defend, especially where the enemie doth abound in Caual|lerie. And so vnder the defence and fauour of the pike, there cannot conuenient|ly stand aboue one ranke of three shot at the most, and so many (in mine opinion) should the girdling conteine: the which girdling shot, kneeling vpon one knee, vnder the couert of the couched pikes, should, at the charging of the horsemen, discharge their vollie in their face and bosome,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>When and how to discharge their vollie.</HI></NOTE> which would bee no small gal|ling vnto them. But when this daunger of horse is not to be feared, then the im|palement may be made of more shot in a ranke, at the discretion of the Sergeant Maior, according to the quantitie of shot contained in his companies, and the rest of the shot to be deuided into sundry small troupes (as I sayd before) to troupe round about the battell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Shot in sundrie small troupes trouping round about the battell. Euery troupe to be led forth to skirmish by their Caporall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Squadrons of muskets, at the angles of the bat|tell.</HI></P></NOTE> with some reasonable distance from the same: the which manner of small troupes, I esteeme to be farre better then the sleeues con|teining great numbers, and more ready to be brought to skirmish, euery seuerall troupe to be led forth by his Caporall, and some Captaines to ouersee the whole.</P>
<P>Moreouer, I would thinke good, at euery angle of the battell to be placed a good squadron of Muskets, which should serue to flanker it euery way, euen as the <HI>Caualleros</HI> or <HI>Trauassos</HI> do the curtaine of a fort: so that a well framed battell or squadron of pikes, well impaled with shot, and anguled with squadrons of Mus|kets, seemeth a Castell with his <HI>curtaines Caualleros,</HI> and ditches: the manner whereof being framed of expert &amp; resolute men, is of wonderfull force, the which was well to be seene in the iorney of <HI>Carua~</HI> in <HI>Barbarie,</HI> where <HI>Don Aluaro de Sandy,</HI> with 4000 <HI>Spanyardes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A braue retraict of Don Aluaro de Sandy made in Barbary, with</HI> 4000. <HI>foote a|gainst</HI> 20000. <HI>horse.</HI></NOTE> foote souldiers of great valour, made a braue famous re|traict, the space of 4. or 5. myles in a champion field, being be set and charged by <HI>Cydearfa,</HI> king of the <HI>Moores,</HI> with aboue twentie thousand horse, at the least fiue or six times, with the losse of onely 80 men of his; and the slaughter of seuen or eight hundred of the enemy.

<P>Your orders and reasons doe like me very well: but yet of one thing I stand in some doubt, and would gladly bee resolued therein, which is, that our bandes and companies of infanterie, haue commonly two thirds of shot, vnto one third of pikes, so that the battell empaled, sleeued and anguled with shot, there will yet abound and remaine good store of shot neuerthelesse. Now where should those be bestowed, to bee safe from the fury of horse, if the enemy should therein greatly abound?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your question is good, and I my selfe haue bethought me many times thereupon: wherefore if your ground be such that the enemies horse may charge you but vpon two parts at the most at once, then may the shot retire safely on the contrary parts: but if you be imbattailled in open <HI>Campania,</HI> without any aduan|tage for you, and your enemy very strong in horse, and you few horse or none to reanswere them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An order for the safegard of shot in open campania, where the enemy aboundeth in horse.</HI></NOTE> then (in mine opinion) the surest way is thus (as I sayd be|fore) in speaking of lining of battels with shot, first to place 5, 6, and 7 rankes of armed pikes, or more, and girdle them with 5 rankes of shot, close vnder the gard and shelter of the pikes, on the out side: then againe within those first rankes of pikes, 3, 4, or 5 rankes of shot, then certaine rankes of pikes, and then shot a|gaine; and so consequently, as your numbers and occasions shall require, as in this figure appeareth.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The figure of such a battell of mixt weapons.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Here is to be noted that in such cases where your battel may be charged on euery part or side, that then those rankes in flanke which haue a wider distance then those men which are in front, doe march vp closer together, whereby they may make the front of equall strength and distance, of station euery way.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="54">In this figure first you see placed the girdling shot 5 in a ranke, vnder the gard and succour of the pikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Declaration of the figure.</HI></NOTE> then 9 rankes of pikes, then certaine rankes of shot, and then pikes againe; and so consequently to the center, where is placed the ensignes, and short weapon, and munition. The girdling shot vpon the very charging of the enemies horse, and at the couching of their pikes, may (kneeling vpon one knee, the better to be vnder the couert of the pikes) discharge in the bosome of the enemy, not aboue twentie pases of: and then the pikes being couched, the o|ther rankes of shot, contained within them, are to discharge close ouer the heades of the couched pikes before them, and so successiuely as the other pikes shall bee couched the shot contained within them shall discharge. So thus (in my conceipt) would this order containe in safetie, the most part of your shot, and bee sufficient strong, and a great gauling vnto horse.</P>

<P>Herein consisteth great skill,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Great skill and care in the mar|ching of an Army.</HI></NOTE> care, direction, and discipline; for gene|rally men be loth and vnwilling to be tied to any strict and painefull order, espe|cially <HI>Besonnios,</HI> wanting practise and patience; for vpon euery light occasion, they will breake and disaray, as when they come to any straight or vnplained way, or when they feele themselues a litle wearied or chafed with heate, running on euery side disorderly to seeke water,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The disorders of souldiers do ma|ny times grow through remis|nesse and negli|gence of officers.

And many times againe vpon small occasions doe they dismande them|selues, the cause thereof growing from the ouer remisnesse and negligence of the officers, in not correcting at first, such disorders with rigour and seuerity, as the vrgentnesse of the cause would require, and for that they want the care and di|ligence to redresse such mismeanours, as hereafter I will speake of, declaring first what the Sergeant Maior is to doe, being in <HI>Campania</HI>: which is to go take the or|ders to be obserued from the Generall, and to know whether his <HI>tertio</HI> or regi|ment is that day to haue the vantgard, battell, or reareward; the which he is to do the night before that the army is to march, although that the General many times for many good respects, will not make the same knowne, vntill the very houre of marching.</P>
<P>And this shall he do chiefly that day, which toucheth his regiment to haue the vantgard.

And at other times for conducting them through passages so difficult and com|bersome, that they haue bene constrained to breake their arraies. For at the re|mouing of a campe, the prauncing and neighing of horses on euery side, and the crossing of cartes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Great noise and rumor in remo|uing of a campe.</HI></NOTE> baggage and carriages, and the noise of drummes and trum|pets, is such and so great, that (if he be not very preconsiderate in the same, and know well the way, where hee is to conduct his companies) he runneth many times into those inconueniences: and chiefly when the campe doth dislodge by night, or in dayes mistie and darke, for then is the daunger most to bee doubted:
<PB N="99" REF="54">

<P>The consideration that is to bee had when an army doth march, is, that if the enemy be knowne to be on head the vantgard, vpon the way you are to passe, then let the munition and baggage be placed in the reareward;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Considerations to be had where the munition is to march.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>per contra,</HI> if the enemy be found to be in the reareward, then passe your baggage to the for|ward: and if on the right side, then conuay it to the left; and if on the left side, then transport it vnto the right, with the like consideration, and in this sort shall the campe be alwayes a wall and defence vnto the munition and baggage. And if in marching the enemy do offer to fight, the munition by this meanes, shall be no let or hinderance at all. And besides all this, there ought to be sent abroade cer|taine Hargulutiers or light horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Certaine light horsemen to be sent out to scout before the muni|tion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In countries se|cure from the e|nemy, the muni|tion is to passe before with a sufficient card. The reasons.</HI></P></NOTE> to scoute before the munition and carriage, to preuent the suddain incursions of the enemies stragling horse. The same order ought also to be obserued in the marching of one regiment alone. But in case that there were no enemy, and they might march through places plaine, safe, and secure, the munition and cariage ought alwayes to passe in the foreward, with a sufficie~t gard of pikes, shot, and short weapons; &amp; that for good respect, &amp; because it is very commodious for the souldiers, that when they come well wearied to their quarter, they may find their tents ready pitched, and many times their forrage pro|uided, and not to stay attending and expecting the same, comming many times, wet, dirtie, ouer tired, and halfe dead with hunger: and again if by hap any of the ca|riages do fal, the owners of the baggage may help to redresse, wherby to saue their baggage and furniture: which could not be done if it marched in the reareward.</P>

<P>But if it should happen, that in none of these sayd parts, the baggage might march in safety (as in <HI>Barbarie,</HI> or other <HI>Champaine</HI> countrey, where the enemies number consisteth most of horse) &amp; we not hauing sufficient numbers to answer them, what is then to be done, where the enemy may charge on euery side?</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In parts of dan|ger the munition is to march in the center, or among the squadrons.</HI></NOTE>Then in the center of the battell, or betwixt the squadrons, with their conuenient gard, as before is sayd: for besides that little which the souldier hath, and carrieth the same there, it is reason he defend and keepe it; so in the like sort he is to procure that the enemy detrusse him not thereof, neither the enemy to glory

<P><HI>The orders to be obserued when the foot souldi|ers do mount on horsebacke.</HI></P></NOTE> but for such as be, it is manifestly knowne, that it is forbidden by al good discipline of war, that no foot soldier do passe out of the campe or alodgement on horsebacke, neither on horsebacke to enter into the same, but alwaies at sallying he acccompany his colours, at the least a mile, and be|fore the arriual to their allodgement, the like. To do the which, their horses may go by one side of the battell, if the way will permit it; and if not, then at the traine therof, vntil they haue licence granted to mount; and yet not that to be permitted, vntill their foot Captaine be first mounted; and then may they mount on horse|backe, and put them selues in order with the Captaine or officer that is to con|duct them, and to this effect should the Sergeant Maior name and appoint some one. And if they be of the shot of the vantgard, then are they to follow their vant|gard troupes of shot; and if pike men, then to follow their arraies or <HI>Maniples</HI> of pikes: and in like sort shall the Hargabuziers of the reareward do, placing them|selues in the traine of their troupes, and shall set their boyes and pages with their armes in their roomes and places, to the end that if occasion be offered, euery mounted souldier may alight, and steppe to his roome and place, without disor|dering their ordinance or arrayes at all.

<P>In their marching should not the souldiers make stayings and pausings, to ease and rest themselues.</P>

<P>It is very necessary that they make some Altoes or standes to ease them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To make sundry altoes or stand, to ease and refresh the souldiers.</HI></NOTE> and that they might refresh themselues with such short victuals as they beare along with them, and by a litle reposing, they may breath and ease them of the wearinesse of the way, and so conserue themselues in good order. For although the souldier be neuer so much practised and inured, and though the shot may suf|fer the wayes trauell without any great pawsing, yet the pikemen, as men laden
<PB N="102" REF="56">
with their armour, are not able to endure the same, especially in dayes of scor|ching heate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carefull to make the Altoes or sta~ds in places conue|nient and fit.</HI></NOTE> without daunger of sicknesse, or brusing of their bodies. Therefore the Campe-maister or Sergeant Maior ought to be very considerate and carefull, to cause the standes to be made, as the commoditie shall be offred, and necessitie require it, to the end, no disgrace might befall them. And for that it hath bene somtimes seene, that the Sergeant Maiors taking litle regard here unto, haue con|ducted their Regiments very disorderly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Disorderly con|duction causes of ouerthrowes.</HI></NOTE> making a long trace file or lyne (as it were) of them: the vantguard distant from the rereward at the least three or foure myles; in such sort, that by much lesser numbers then the numbers of their owne companies, they may many times, be beaten and ouerthrowne: as it chaunced vnto the <HI>French</HI> armie in <HI>Lombardie,</HI> being defeated by <HI>Antonio de Leyua,</HI> gouer|nour there, for the Emperour <HI>Charles,</HI> at their marching towards <HI>Viagrass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> their Commaunder,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Example at Via grassa in Lom|bardie, when the Cou~tie Sanpaule was taken.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>In encamping an army, it is accustomed most commonly to entrench round about the quarters thereof, for more security and strength to the allodge|ment: and when it is so, the companies which haue the ward, are alwayes to sal|lie to gard the trenches, which is the wall of the campe. But in case there bee no trenches, the Corps de gard (in mine opinion) is not to be placed aboue 70, or 80, pases distance (as I haue said before) from the front of the allodgements in his place of armes; yet somtimes there be found ditches, bottoms, and vallies so strong, that it shall be good for the gards to be placed there, although they be far|ther distant off,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Great silence is to bee kept in the body of the watch.</HI></NOTE> then I speake of; for such strengths by nature do serue and stand in steede of ditches and trenches. But not finding such naturall fences, the wat|ches are to be placed, as before I haue sayd. For thus, as well for the security of the quarters, as for (if neede should require) to succour those companies, it is better they be placed neare then farre off. And it is to be noted, as a thing of great importance, that great silence be kept in the body of the watch, at the least all ru|mour and lowd noises are to be excluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sentinels what distance a|sunder, and from the Corps de guard.</HI></NOTE> and in their conuersations to talke mo|destly, stilly, and with low voices.</P>

And this such Sentinell is to be placed in some part so neare vnto the enemie, that being discryed and seene, he shall with great diffi|cultie retire and escape:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An example.</HI></NOTE> and is neuer set but vpon necessitie of such like aduises: As when <HI>Frauncis</HI> the <HI>French</HI> king, did relieue and victuall <HI>Landresie,</HI> which the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> held besieged, who determined to giue him battell the next day before he were departed; and so <HI>Don Fernando de Gonzaga,</HI> who was Gene|rall, commaunded Captaine <HI>Salazar</HI> that he should that night put himselfe neare vnto the enemies campe, therby to vnderstand their desseignes and intents: but he missed to effect the same.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The forlorne Se~|tinell, not to haue the word but a different Conter|signe.</HI></NOTE> So the <HI>French</HI> retired in safetie and wel without any per|ceiuing thereof.

<HEAD>THE THIRD DIALOGVE.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>VVherein is declared, some orders to be obserued by the Sergeant Maior, in the very fact of armes: and in surprises and Camisadas, and Ambuscados: and to be a ge|nerall procurer of the souldiers good.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman.</SPEAKER>
<P>_WHat orders is the Sergeant Maior to obserue, in the times of fight with the enemy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Sergeant Maior cannot keepe any certaine rule therein, considering the diuersitie of chaunces, stratagems and po|licies, which in euery moment do happen in warre.</P>
<P>But in the action of battell, he is to see, and to foresee (as before I sayd) as well their owne, as their enemies orders, and disorders; to redresse with all valour, rea|dinesse, and skill,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What the Ser|geant Maior is to do in the fact of battell.</HI></NOTE> what is needfull in his owne squadrons, and to espie euery aduan|tage vpon the enemy: and valiantly to animate, order and encourage his soul|diers to valour, vertue and honour; and that with couragious and honourable words: and if by fortune any of his squadrons be disordered and broken, he must with all speedinesse, courage, and skill redresse the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if any men in the rankes of his squadrons be hurt or slaine, either by the enemies great shot, or otherwise, so that wanting there those men which so are slaine or hurt, how are these rankes to be refurnished, so that it may be done without confusion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>The order of the <HI>Romanes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Romaines order was to fight in battallions. The Greekes did fight in Phalan|gia, or square. Men slaine or hurt in the first rankes, how to re|forme the rankes. The fore rankes to be alwayes kept full.</HI></NOTE> as I haue already sayd, was to fight in order of battallions, the one to second the other, which is a very strong order of fight, were men expert and skilfull therein: And the manner of the <HI>Greekes</HI> was in <HI>Pha|langia</HI>; which is a iust square of men, whom we do therein imitate: which manner of square of men is, each man standing consequently in ranke, and in file one after other: so that if any of the first files or rankes be slaine or hurt, the next soldier suc|ceeding the same man hurt or slaine, is to step vp into his place &amp; roome, and the next after to follow him; and so successiuely one to follow another, euen vnto the center or traine of the squadron: in such sort that alwayes the formost rankes be fully furnished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And what is to be done with those hurt and slaine men, for me thinkes they should be looked vnto.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>officers appointed to withdraw hurt and slaine men out of the battell.</HI></NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Spaniardes haue a laudable custome, which is, that they haue cer|taine men appointed of purpose, to retract and draw foorth of the squadrons, such men as be hurt, and to bring them vnto the chirurgians: and for such as bee
<PB N="110" REF="60">
slaine right out, to conuay them away, so that their slaine numbers is neuer light|ly knowne to the enemy. Which order I would wish to be receiued and obserued amongst vs.</P>

And also when other great occasions are offered, where it is needefull to carry the souldiers with great silence, secrecie, and stilnesse, he is to be their guide; as did the Sergeant Maior <HI>Valleio,</HI> when <HI>Mondragon</HI> with his regiment pas|sed ouer the riuer <HI>Schalt,</HI> to succour their friends besieges in <HI>Targoes.</HI></P>
<P>And in <HI>Ambuscados,</HI> which are to be done in places of couert; as woods, thic|kets, hollow wayes, or hils, he is to be carefull that the souldiers be silent and with|out noise, for not to be discouered, vntill their espials and watches, appointed for that purpose, doe giue them the signe of the conuenient time of their sodaine charge vpon the enemy.</P>
<P>Also it is the Sergeant Maiors part to be sollicitous and diligent with the prince or Captaine Generall of the army, and the other superiour officers, for the proui|ding of armour, and other necessaries for the companies of his regiment, and for the other munitions of powder, match, lead, and victuals: the which he shal cause to be reparted vnto the Sergeants of the bands, to be by them deliuered vnto the Caporals, who are to distribute the same among the companies.</P>
<P>And to conclude, he ought to be the vniuersall procurer of the souldiers good, procuring their payes, and that they be succoured in their necessities and wants. And if there be any hurt men or sicke, hee is to procure that they may be caried with all care, vnto the hospitals or such places deputed for the same, prouiding them of cariages, necessaries, and guides if neede require. To do all the which he hath all the officers of the regiment for helpers and ministers; which are to as|sist and obey him, For the cariage-maister is to furnish him with cartes, and cari|ages as shall be needefull, and the furrier maior, to prouide and bring munition at the day of battell: and the Sergeants to assist him, to set the squadrons and to keepe the companies in order and array: and the ensignes and Lieutenants to giue and notifie the orders and commandes to the gards for the seruice of the companies: and the drumme maior to proclaime and sound the generall com|mandes, bandos, and lawes of the field, and to giue warning vnto the Captaines, and companies, which are to haue the watch: and the Caporals of the field, being his <HI>Coadiutors,</HI> to assist and helpe him in all matters, and actions generall tou|ching his office, with whom he is to consult, and communicate his proper autho|rity vnto the best experimented of them (with leaue of his superiour comman|ders)

And of this repartition (communi|cating it first vnto his Colonell) he is to giue an order and instruction in writing, firmed with his hand vnto the Captaines and Ensignes of euerie Companie, reseruing a copy thereof himselfe, to the ende that no officer might with reason excuse himselfe, if hee should chance to commit any fault or negligence in any

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Great care to bee had in deuiding the guardes.</HI></NOTE>And because there is great consideration and care to bee had in deuiding the guardes of a Fort, Hould, and Towne of defence, chiefly if any enemy army be expected to the same, notwithstanding that in all other times this care and foresight is to be obserued in this function:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>No companie to haue any one place assigned them to k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">epe customably.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The walkes for the Roundes to be made commodi|ous.</HI></P></NOTE> he should in no case assigne vnto eue|ry company the part of the wall or bulwarke which they are ordinarily to keepe: for the most often that townes haue beene taken by practize, <HI>tracto,</HI> or treason, the principall cause hath beene, that the Sentinell or officer, which so selleth the place, hath knowne the part and quarter where ordinarily hee was to guard and watch, whereof wee haue many examples: and therefore hee ought to as|semble, and gather into the place euery euening, the companies which are to bee that night of the watch, and that they draw lots, or cast the dice for the quar|ters which shall concerne them to keepe: and the troupes or squadraes, and Sentinels shall obserue the same order: in such sort that neither any companie, may foreknow his quarter, nor yet the squadra, what part of the wall doth ap|pertaine vnto them, vntill the very houre that the watches be set, and placed in the same.</P>
<P>Now this partition being made (as is sayd) hee is to consider very well, whether the Corps de guard, where the company or companies are to enter into and stand, be fit and commodious; and also those of the gates and caualleros. And if they haue neede of repairing, let him cause it foorthwith to be done, and also the garrits and watch houses, where the posts and Sentinels are to be placed, and whether they bee sufficient to defend and keepe out the raine: and this to be done at the charge of the city or towne, as is accustomed. And if the Rounds cannot commodiously passe round about the wals, he is to cause it to be accom|modated foorthwith.

<HEAD>The Camp-maister or Colonell, his Election and Office.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gentlemen.</SPEAKER>
<P>_THe next officer, in superiour degree, is the Camp-maister or Colo|nell. The election of this officer is made by the Prince, with the aduise of his Councell of state and warre. His office is, to be Com|maunder and Chiefteine ouer the Captaines, and all the other of|ficers of his <HI>Tertio</HI> or Regiment:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Colonell his office and Com|mande is ouer the Captaines and souldiers of his regiment.</HI></NOTE> hauing iurisdiction &amp; dominion ouer them all. Whereby may be inferred and gathered the partes and qualities which ought to be in him, and the great skill and experience in warre; as one who ought to exceede them all, for to know how to commaunde, rule, and gouerne them, with authoritie, prudence and valour. And for as much as in many occur|rants and occasions, growing and presented in warres, he ought to know how to performe the parts and office of a Lord high Generall,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Principall partes in a Colonell.</HI></NOTE> being alone with the com|panies of his owne Regiment, as when his Generall commaundeth him to the batterie, or siege of any fort or Citie, or to defend any towne or fortresse, or to warre in open <HI>Campania,</HI> to giue battell to the enemie, to make incursions, to re|tire and withdraw skirmishers, to frame bridges ouer riuers, to fortifie himselfe in campe, to conduct artillerie, and many other peeces of seruice to be performed with a band of three or foure thousand men: whereof there are many rare exam|ples, extant of many braue Colonels, who haue shewed themselues singular here|in, both <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Exa~ple of braue Colonels Lucius Martius.</HI></P>

And now for to know how to commaund and gouerne all the officers of his band, and of all the other co~panies in his regiment, he ought most perfectly to vnderstand that which toucheth euery particular officer, euen from the <HI>Capo de squadra,</HI> vnto the Sergeant Maior: and it would bee a matter of great importance, to haue exerci|sed, and to haue risen vp through all these offices, the better how to know, and perfectionate his owne: for by knowing this, the Captaine, the Sergeant Maior and all the rest, will walke more warily, and passe more punctually in the accom|plishing of all their charges and duties, knowing that they haue a commaunder so skilfull, which quickly will perceiue, either their vertues or vices: perswading them to the one, &amp; disswading the~ from the other: the which in actions of warre do either greatly helpe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The squadra of the Colonel, band ought to be soul|diers of experie~ce and valour and be aduantaged in their payes.

<P>They are strong by nature, when they are enuironed with the seas round a|bout, or part thereof, or backed with lakes, mountaines, riuers, or desertes. And those are strong by art, which in their frontiers, and in places most conuenient, haue townes, castels, and fortresses, fortified by art.</P>

<P>All confines are either Mediterraneall, or Maritime, or both the one and the other;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>All confines are either Mediter|raniall or Ma|ritime or both. Considerations.</HI></NOTE> and either they are in mountainous places, or in plaine champain, or do participate of the one, and the other. If they be Mediterraneall, it must bee viewed and considered on what part the enemy might enter to offend the coun|trie, and what passages he might haue most commodious to conduct his Army, with his munitions and impediments. And it is to bee considered also, on what partes he may most easily make his inrodes, and retire againe with safety, and whether there be any situation, which being fortified by the enemy, might molest and annoy the countrey adioyning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Maritime Con|fines.</HI></NOTE>If the confines of the kingdome bee Maritime or sea coast, all the coastes and compases are to be viewed and remarked; and to see and consider, whether there be any gulfe, shore, baye, creeke, hauen, port, or any riuer mouth, whereinto the enemy entring with his nauie, and there landing, might annoy and assayle a countrie.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nota.</HI></NOTE> For sea coasts, although they be in some respects strong, yet are they to be entred by a nauie by sea, and do hold the defendant in great suspence and care, not knowing where, or in what part, such nauy will arriue; and so is he driuen to greater charge, being constrained to keepe garrisons in euery suspected place.</P>
<P>And yet it is not inough to keepe good strengths in places most necessarie, and well prouided, for that many times there is found a shore, a baye, a creeke, or riuer mouth, not before esteemed or thought vpon, whereunto the enemy arri|uing and entring with a mighty nauy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A principall note Example of the Spanish nauy, &amp; armes in Portu|gall.</HI></NOTE> and there fortifying himselfe vpon some strong and fit situation, doth put the countrey and kingdome in great perill and daunger. As was seene by the Spanish nauy and army, at the conquest of the <HI>Por|tugall</HI> kingdome, who touched at the head of <HI>Caxcais,</HI> and landed in a place neuer thought vpon by the Portingall, so they found themselues deceiued, thin|king that the disembarkment should haue beene betwixt the city and <HI>San Gillians</HI> Castle, where they stood fortified in their trenches, with determination to de|fend

And for as much as there be diuerse and variable qualities of confines, and no certaine rule to be giuen thereupon, nor what distance there should be from frontier to fron|tier, it must be presupposed that the confines of a kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The confines of a kingdome resem|bled to the circuit of a city.</HI></NOTE> doth hold some correspondency with the circuit of a city: in the fortification whereof, the bul|warkes are the most important members, the which are set in the place where they may most offend the enemy, and also defend themselues, and the city; regard|ing therein due distance, in such sort that the one may defend the other, with their Artillery and small shot, and in like manner the Curtines betwixt bulwarke and bulwarke; with other aduertisements therein to be considered. And euen so the sortes to be made in the frontiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fortes of confines what proportion to hold.</HI></NOTE> are to hold the like proportion, and corres|pondency with the confines of the countrie, as do the bulwarks with the courtines of a city; the one being placed so neare vnto the other, that they may assist and suc|cour one another, and in such partes as may most damnifie the enemy, and best defend themselues.</P>
<P>The places most apt to receiue offence by the enemy, being found out, and also to offend him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Places apt to re|ceiue offence by the enemy, are first to be forti|fied.</HI></NOTE> it is necessary to fortifie the same, as well the sea coasts as the in|land, with strong fortifications, castles, and bulwarkes taking wonderfull adui|sement, and carefull consideration in chusing the situations thereof, whether it be on plaines, or hils, or Maritime; or consisting of all three, vnderstanding onely the compasse or circuit of the fort, with a certaine conuenient space round a|bout the same.</P>

<P>And it is to be noted, that very small places are of themselues but weake, be|cause they cannot so sufficiently resist any excessiue battery, and other offences, as great places may, which haue roome capable inough to raise defences, and ne|cessary Rampartes against any great force: neither yet ought they to be so large, that the circuit therof would require a whole army to defend it.</P>

<P>And it is to be noted, that the artillery is deuided and differenced, into great|nesse or Sizes royall, and into lesser sizes.</P>
<P>Of the Size royal, is that peece which shooteth a bullet from seuenteene pound waight vpward; as is the Culuerine, the quarter Cannon, the demy Cannon, the Cannon and double Cannon; the Pedrera, Basilisco, and such like. And for the lesser size and difference, is to be vnderstood all peeces that shoot bullet of waight from seuenteene pound downeward, as is the demy Culuerine, the Saker, the Minion, the Falcon, the Falconet, euen to the Rabinet, and Hargubuze a Croek.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What artillery most offensiue to fortresses and strong places.</HI></NOTE>The artillery from whence a City, Fortresse or Fort, may receiue most offence and dammage, is that of the greatest size, and greatnesse: for of the lesser size there is no great doubt to be had, sith that the demy Culuerine can do no great offence nor dammage, and from that size downeward: and therefore the Bulwarkes, Ter|raplenes, and Parapets, are to be made in such sort and strength, as they may be able to resist and beare of the blow and gulpe of the artillery of the greatest size: and Mattockes, shouels and spades are fit instruments and tooles to the same.</P>

<P>It is necessary to make in the Bulwarkes certaine issues or sallies, the which are made on the part that looketh toward the flanker or Trauesse: &amp; the Bulwark ha|uing an Orecchion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Issues, or Sallies.</HI></NOTE> they are made in the first Trauesse, vnder the first Cannonera or Canno~ roome: and at the least it ought to haue one, for that they be very neces|sary for the defence of the ditch, and to put people out thereat. And for the better to giue you to vnderstand, I should draw a Plat or figure of the Bulwarke, but time now permitteth me not.</P>
<P>The Tronera or which standeth next vnto the Orecchion ought to defend the front of the Bulwarke, and part of the ditch, although the first may de|fend the whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Tronera, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI></NOTE> &amp; therfore the point or front of the Orecchion shall alwayes ende with two blunt or obtuse Angles, and shall be somwhat more narrow in the said front or end, th in then beginning neare vnto the Tronera.</P>

<P>In these our dayes, the Cauallerie is most commonly diffe|renced in three sortes: Into men at Armes, or Companies of Ordi|nance termed by some; but now litle in vse: Into demy Lances, now called Lanciers, and into shot on horseback, named Hargulutiers or Hargubuziers, or Carbins, Petranels, and Pistolliers.</P>
<P>The Man at Armes is armed complete,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Man at Armes his ar|ming, weapon and mounture.</HI></NOTE> with his cuyrasses of proose, his close helmet with a beuer, a gorget, strong pouldrons, vambraces, gauntlets &amp; taisses; a strong Lance well headed with steele, an arming sword; and at his sadle bow, a mace, well mounted vpon a strong &amp; couragious horse, hauing a deepe &amp; strong sadle, with the two cuissets of Pistoll proose, his horse barded with a sufficient Pe|ctron, crinier &amp; chieffront &amp;c. a strong bridle, double rayned, wherof one to be of wyer were not amisse against the blow of a sword.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Men at Armes are commonly men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itle and qualitie.</HI></NOTE> These Men at Armes were wo~t to haue fiue or six horses attendant vpo~ each one. In this Co~panie of Ordinance, are few, but men of qualitie &amp; Gentles of good birth: the charge thereof is great.</P>
<P>Vnto euery Companie of these doth belong,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>One trumpet, one Ensigne, one Gui|don, &amp; one Cor|net.</HI></NOTE> one Trumpet, one Ensigne, one Guidon, and one Cornet: the Ensigne ouer the Men at Armes, the Cornet ouer the Lanciers, and the Guidon ouer the shot on horsebacke. Now by reason of
<PB N="142" REF="76">
their heauie arming, their marches are but slow; and not lightly marching except the campe dislodge: and then to keepe an equall place with the foote campe, deui|ded into good squadrons vpon either side of the battell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deuided into squadron.</HI></NOTE> with a co~uenient distance from the same: for being too neare, many inconueniences doe many times hap|pen, especially hauing charged or encountred the enemy; and driuen to retire, do hazard many times to disaray their owne battell.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their partes of seruice.</HI></NOTE> Their seruice is commonly, es|pying aduantage to breake vpon the squadrons of pikes, to encounter the ene|mies horse, and to relieue their owne light horse, if by hap they bee put to a re|trait. But a good squadron of pikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The honourable valour of pikes footemen.</HI></NOTE> of resolute men, well empaled and girdled with musket, doth greatly discredit their auncient reputation now in these our dayes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The arming of the Lanciers.</HI></NOTE>The arming of the Lanciers, is a good paire of cuirats, the fore part of Pistoll proofe, a strong cask with his open visier, of like proofe, two l'ames of his poul|drons, two or three of his taisses of Pistoll proofe also, the rest, his pouldro~s, vam|braces, gauntlets,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His weapons.</HI></NOTE> taisses and cuissets, as light as may be: a strong Lance well poin|ted, a good curtilace, and short dagger, and a Pistoll at his saddle bow in a case of leather:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nting.</HI></NOTE> a stro~g saddle with his two cuissets for the knees; and well mounted vpon a strong horse vnbarded, and their cassackes of the colour of the Ensigne.</P>

They ought to know how to manage well a horse, runne a good carrier, breake surely a Lance, to bee ready with their arming sword and pistoll. Their place of march &amp; seruice is before the men at armes a good distance, in troupes or squadrons, with their Cornet in the middest, or within the third ranke before. They serue to many purposes, and to most peeces of seruice, as well to breake on a squadron of pikes, first shaken or disarayed by shot, as to encounter the enemies horse, to backe &amp; succour the Pe|tranels and Hargulutiers being distressed, to conduct their owne, and to detrusse the enemies conuoy in companie with the Carbines and other shot, to surprise the enemies troupes vpon any aduantage spied: and in generall, good for most peeces of seruice fit for horse; whereunto the men at armes are both too heauie and vnapt.</P>

<P><HI>Their partes in|cident</HI></P></NOTE> And in good conductions they are alwayes secon|ded with armed Pistols or Lances: for they are not lightly turned out to any peece of seruice vpon armed men, without being accompanied with Lances, or cuyrats on horsebacke, I meane armed petranels or pistoliers. They ought to bee very nimble both to mount on horsebacke, and to dismount; to manage their horse euery manner of way; to be very ready and quicke with their peece, discharging on euery part,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To performe</HI> 3. <HI>actes at one in|stant.</HI></NOTE> as cause shall require, inuring their horse both to the crack and fire; and learne to performe three actes at one instant, his bridle hand, his peece, and his spurres: wherein consisteth fine skill, with viuacitie of spirite, attained by often vse and practise. For they are the forlorne skirmishers on horsebacke, who hauing performed their dutie doe retire behind their Lanciers and armed pistols. And it is not inough to know how to ride a horse well,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He ought to be a good horseman and a good shot.</HI></NOTE> and vnpractised in his peece; neither is it inough to bee skilfull in his peece, and ignorant in his horse: but the one must bee coupled with the other to make a perfect Hargulutier.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fierie weapo~ in the vnskilfull is daungerous to themselues.

To conclude, all these aforesaid mounted people, ought to be seene &amp; haue some skill in diseases of horses, and to know remedies for the same: and if neede require, to set a shoe also.

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well (Gentlemen) sith you do still egge and draw me on, with your cu|rious demaundes, I will shew you (the best I can) the orders obserued by the best <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Encampers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Briefe repetition.</HI></NOTE>You know that I haue shewed you before, of the generall and particular parts of a souldier, their seuerall offices, euen fro~ the Caporall vnto his Camp-maister generall: the number of a band, their due sortment &amp; difference of weapons, and their seuerall vses: the orders of training, marching, and embattailling in sundry manners now most in vse; the seuerall parts and dutie of euery officer in degree, with a number of other points which now I remember not. Now lastly to your demaund touching the marching and allodgement of a campe, I say: That when an Armie marcheth neare vnto the enemies Army, it is needfull that there be had many and great considerations:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Many and great considerations in the marching of an Armie.</HI></NOTE> as first when the one Armie is not of equall force vnto the other, or when one is not disposed to come to the fact of battell, for not to put, by one onely battell into the hands of fortune all a mans habilitie &amp; whole rest in fine, as many misaduised men haue done; therefore to prolong time, and to shunne the doubtfull fact of armes, it were needfull to make choise to march (if possible you may) through mountaine groundes and hillie, and with such ad|uantage of seate and ground, that the enemy may not with any reason of aduan|tage, assault you: But when this may not be yet eschued, at the least it is to bee procured to be done to the best aduantages, and (as it were) with a certaine hope of victory; the which may partly bee performed when you know how to profit your selfe with the aduantage that the situation will affoord. And in your mar|ching, I would wish you to send some part of your light horse so neare vnto the enemy, as continually you haue notice of all their orders and courses. True it is, that when you are in a countrey, where this aduantage of hils is not to be found, and must of necessitie march through plaines and champaine fields, and haue the enemy neare at hand, it were then very hard to shunne and auoide battell, the which I would rather wish to be done, then otherwise, especially if your Army do surmount your enemy in Cauallerie, for in such cases the battell is not to be refu|sed, your strength consisting most in horse, the which by good conduction, giueth a great part to the victory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>To march vpon grounds of ad|uantage, as did Fabius Maxi|mus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Charles the fift.</HI></P></NOTE>This manner of marching vpon grounds of aduantage, we reade antiquitie to haue vsed; as did <HI>Fabius Maximus,</HI> when he encamped a long time with the <HI>Ro|mane</HI> Armie, against the conquerour <HI>Hanniball</HI>: &amp; in our time, as did <HI>Charles</HI> the fift in <HI>Germanie,</HI> against the Protestants Army: both the which, by reason of the situations and seates, did many times encampe and lodge with their armies, not distant one from the other, aboue a Culuerine shot: the which might possible be, by reason of the hilles and mountaine seates abounding in them places. But this is seldome seene in the plaines,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Considerations to be had, the Army marching in plaines &amp; cham|paines.</HI></NOTE> and champain grounds; in the which it is need|full for him that shunneth the battell, to march and passe, at the least, eight or ten myles distant from the enemy: and must thinke to fortifie at euery allodgement, in such sort and manner, that neither horse nor foote, in any array of battell, may not, but with great difficultie, charge or enter vpon you; the which is suffi|cient with a campall fortification, or running campe, as some terme it; and chief|ly because it ought to be done with great speede and diligence, the which encam|ping,
<PB N="153" REF="80">
when it shall seeme you good to continue, may bee reduced into such strength, as might seeme sufficient.</P>
<P>And in the marching which the armie shall make through plaines and cham|pain fieldes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Points of aduan|tage.</HI></NOTE> when it commeth to passe to haue either any litle riuer, wood, or groue to couer one flanke of the campe, all diligence is to bee vsed to gaine such sayd aduantage: for it will be a matter of great importance. Alwayes hauing a re|gard, that the artillerie, munition, and other impediments doe alwayes passe on the contrary side from the enemy: and also that the squadrons of men at armes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Men at armes &amp; Lanciers to fla~ke the arrayes.</HI></NOTE> &amp; Lanciers do flanke the arrayes and battallions next toward the enemy, in sort and maner conuenient.

<P><HI>Their orders.</HI></P></NOTE> that is, in vantguard, battell and rereward, and euery day to change the point, making the vantguard, battell; and the battell rere|ward; and the rereward, vantguard: and that euery one of these partes may haue their due proportions and numbers of Cauallerie and shot, distinguished in their conuenient places; aduertising with great diligence and care, that there bee not mingled any vnprofitable people among the Ordinances and squadrons of the Infanterie;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vnprofitable people to be shif|ted out of the squadron.</HI></NOTE> and that euery battell be placed in their due appointed places and di|stances, vnder their Ensignes and colours; in such sort that all the troupes of Ca|uallerie be quite cleared of vnprofitable horses, and other impediments, wherein the <HI>Germaines</HI> horsemen do keepe great order,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vnprofitable horses and impe|diments cleared. Part of the light horses to be conti|nually abroad.</HI></NOTE> care, and diligence; very necessa|rie to be imitated. It is a very good custome besides, that part of the light horse be continually abroad at discouery &amp; scout; and to watch after euery action that the enemies Armie doth, that you may bee alwayes aduertised thereof: so that, if occasion bee, you may haue time, space, and commoditie to prepare to the encounter and battell. Touching the order of marching the campe, there can bee no particular rules set downe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Referring to the third and fourth booke.</HI></NOTE> more then I haue before spoken of in the third and fourth booke (where I haue entreated of the framing of squadrons, marching an Armie, and of deuiding the same into <HI>Maniples,</HI> comming vnto any straight passage or narrow wayes) because it must be accommodated according to the situation and qualitie of the countrey wherein you march.</P>
<P>Let vs now therefore passe on to speake of the allodgement of a campe;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Partes to be con|sidered in the al|lodgement of a campe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The situation, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plaines.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Considerations.</HI></P></NOTE> and of the seates, and the forme, and of the greatnesse, and of the commodities, and of the fortifying the same; and of the orders to be therein obserued. And first tou|ching the situation, I say; that being in a plaine or champain field, farre distant from mounts and hilles, it is then necessary to haue either riuers, or such qua~titie of waters, as may commodiously serue the whole campe, both horse &amp; foote: with aduisement that there may be had, from the next adioyning woods, timber of all sortes, for the vse and needes of the campe: the like consideration is also to bee had for forrage for the horses, as things not to be carried alwayes after a campe: and to do it (when these commodities may bee had) with such sure fortifications, that the enemy may not annoy you.</P>
<P>The circuite &amp; greatnesse of the campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The circuit of the campe.</HI></NOTE> ought not to be such, that might hin|der, in any occasion offered, to succour, keepe and defend the same, as is conue|nient and needfull; neither yet that it be of such straightnesse, and narrownesse, that the Armie cannot haue all his commodities, eases, and places necessarie to frame their squadrons, and set themselues in battell ray: and common places for
<PB N="154" REF="81">
victuallers, pioners, and others following the campe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The formes.</HI></NOTE>And touching the forme, it shall be such and in such order, as shall appeare by the plats and draughtes; accommodating the same vnto the situations and groundes: as moreouer shall be seene euery quarter with their places and streets to issue forth, and with the place of the Generals lodging. And all these things shall be set downe in the most plainest and best order that we can.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Mountaine si|tuations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Considerations.</HI></P></NOTE>And when in like sort it shall happen and occurre to encampe vpon any moun|taine situation or hill: or may be variably set, as in a valley, neare broken rockes, riuers, woodes, or hollow wayes, and such like, if the Camp-maister Generall be a skilfull man of warre (as he ought to be) and perfect in encamping an Army, he may aduantage himselfe greatly therewith: and shall with litle arte, most strongly fortifie his campe or allodgement.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>To beware to en|campe in place subiect to any hill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Daungerous.</HI></P></NOTE> But aboue all he must be well adui|sed that hee encampe not in any place subiect vnto any hill or mount, or any al|ture that may ouerlooke the campe, and so from thence batter the Curtines of the rampiers; for being so occupied by the enemy, the Generall should bee forced to dislodge, and happely constrained to fight to his great disaduantage: as it was like to fall out vnto <HI>Frauncis</HI> the French king,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Example by Fra~|cis the French king at Cambre|sie.</HI></NOTE> when hee was encamped at <HI>Cam|bresie,</HI> vpon the borders of <HI>Picardie,</HI> for leauing a litle hill vnpossest, vpon the one side of his encampement, the which discouered ouer all his campe, and lay right ouer against the Curtines thereof:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charles the fift.</HI></NOTE> and the Emperour <HI>Charles,</HI> comming thither with his Armie, the sayd place being espied and reknowledged by his Captaines, was by them encouraged, that, although the houre were late, and his people much wearied with long marching, yet were it not good to lose, and let slippe the occasion to gaine so aduantagious a seate: But this profitable &amp; prudent aduise, was, by some others of great authoritie, contradicted, saying; that the morning ensuing, the same might bee better performed. The which fell not so out; for the king being aduised of this errour, sent that night his <HI>Italian</HI> Infanterie to take and fortifie the same hill: which did frustrate the Emperours desseignes.</P>
<P>There are many and sundry aduertisements to be yet giuen, touching the marching, and encamping of an Armie, but, for not to be tedious, I passe them ouer;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cauallerie in their allodge|ment to be defen|ded by the In|fanterie.</HI></NOTE> onely aduertising that the Cauallerie, in their quarters and allodgement, would be defended and shadowed by the Infanterie, as much as reasonably might be; for that, vpon any sudden alarme giuen, the horse are farre more vnready then the foote, and do require a longer time in arming, and ordering; and of the footemen, the shot to be sooner ready then the pikes, and therefore in the en|camping, the due consideration of each of these is to be had: as I haue in my plat of encamping, in fol. 157. set downe.</P>

<P>In the first of these two figured plats of encampement of 30000 foote|men, and 6000 horsemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>A declaration of the former en|campement. The Generals place. The Lord Mar|shals allodge|ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Treasurers allodgement.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The place of mu|nition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The place of market.</HI></P></NOTE> distinguished as there appeareth; I haue dissigned for the Generals pauillion and place, 80 pases square, comprehending therein the breadth of the two maine streets, of 20 pases each in breadth. Vpon one quar|ter of the Generals place, is lodged the Lord Marshall and his retinew; vpon ano|ther quarter is lodged the Treasurer, with extraordinary Gentlemen and Embas|sadors: vpon another quarter is the munition of victuals; and vpon the last quar|ter, is made the place of market: euery of these 4 quarters, and places containing their narrow front, butting vpon the maine street South &amp; North, &amp; East &amp; West, 45 pases and in length 63 pases, fronting along the small crosse streets. Round a|bout three of the said quarters, is drawne a smal streete, of 10 pases broade, and on the other part is a streete running, of 15 pases broade: without the which streets, vpon the one side of the Generals place, and the other two places of the Lord Mar|shall, and munition of victuals,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> 1000 <HI>men at armes quarter</HI></NOTE> I haue quartered the 1000 men at armes in 4 little quarterets containing in euery quarteret 250 men at armes: allowing for euery man at armes 6 allodgements, and 2 allodgements for his place of armes, which are 8 allodgements; containing euery allodgement 50 superficiall foote of ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rule to worke it.</HI></NOTE> that is, 10 foote in length, and 5 for breadth. Now, the working thereof is thus: multiply the 1000 men at armes by 8 allodgements, it maketh 8000 al|lodgements, the which 8000 multiply againe by 50 foote superficiall, which is allowed for euery allodgement, and it maketh 400000 superficiall foote; the which 400000,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 <HI>foote do make a superfici|all pase of</HI> 5 <HI>foote.</HI></NOTE> deuide by 25, it commeth out to be 16000 pases superficiall, for 25 superficiall foote, do make a superficiall pase. So the 1000 men at armes doe require, 16000 pases superficiall for their quarters, and place of armes. Now to deuide these 1000 men at armes into 4 litle quarterets, each quarteret co~taining 250 men at armes, deuide the 16000 pases superficiall by 4, and the product will be 4000 superficiall pases for euery quarteret, whose square roote is 63, for the square of each quarteret, being quartered one way, with the great maine streete of 20 pases broade,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math"> <HI>Their place of armes.</HI> <GAP DESC="math"> <HI>The light horse|mens quarter.</HI></NOTE> and the other way with a lesser streete of 10 pases broade. Now to know the square side of all these 4 quarterets, extract the quadrat root of the 16000 superficiall pases, being 126 pases, and that is the due square of euery side. Finally to know what square of ground, the place of armes for these thousand men at armes shall containe, multiply the 1000 men at armes by two allodge|ments of euery man, and it amounteth 2000 allodgements: then againe mul|tiply these 2000 by 50 foote superficiall for each allodgement, and it maketh 100000 superficiall foote, this 100000 superficiall foote, deuide by 25, to bring them into superficiall pases, and it produceth 4000 pases superficiall; of this 4000 pases superficiall take the quadrat roote, which commeth out to be 63 pases square, little more.</P>
<P>Thus the place of armes of these 4 little quarterets, co~taining in them all 1000 men at armes, doth containe 63 pases square, besides the breadth of the two streets, which crosse the quarters, not comprehended therein. Vpon the other side of the Generals place, and also without the two other places of market, and Noblemens lodgings, Southward, I haue dissigned the 2000 light horse, or Car|bins, deuided from the same by a street of 10 pases broade: vnto euery light horse I haue allowed 3 allodgements, and one allodgement for his place of armes, which doe make 4 allodgements for euery lighthorse. Now to multiply the
<PB N="160" REF="86">
2000 light horse by 4, and it produceth 8000 allodgements: then I multiply a|gaine the 8000 by 50 foote, and it amounteth vnto 40000 foote superficiall; then to bring the~ into superficiall pases, I deuide the 4000000 foot by 25 (for 25 super|ficiall foot, do make a superficiall pase) and the product will be 16000 superficiall pases,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> for their quarters and places of armes. Now, to repart these 2000 light-horse into 4 litle quarterets, ech quarteret co~taining 500 light-horse, I deuide the 16000 pases superficiall by 4, and the product is 4000 superficiall pases, for eue|ry quarteret, the square roote whereof is 63, being quartered one way with the great maine streete of 20 pases broade, running North and South, and the other way with a lesser streete of 10 pases broade, running East and West. Now againe, to know the square side of all these 4 quarterets; take the quadrat roote of the 16000 superficiall pases, which is 126 and little more, and that is the due square of euery side of all the 4 quarterets, not comprehending the breadth of the 2 streets which crosse the same therin; and the &frac12; of 126, which is 63, is the iust square side of euery one of the 4 little quarterets. And now lastly to know what quantity of ground the place of armes for these 2000 light horse will require,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their place of armes.</HI></NOTE> I multiply the 2000 light horse by 1 allodgement, which is 50 superficiall foote, and it ma|keth 100000 superficiall foote, the which 100000 I deuide by 25, so it commeth out to be 4000 superficiall pases, the quadrat roote whereof is 63 and a litle more, and so much containeth their place of armes, besides the breadth of the aforesayd two crosse streets, the which do enlarge their place of armes by so much. Thus are the men at armes lodged vpon one side of the Generals place, and the light horse vpon the other side, as in the plat plainely appeareth.</P>
<P>Next, vpon the West part of the Generals place, and without the two quarters or lodgings of the Marshall and Treasurer, with a streete of 10 pases broade be|twixt, I haue lodged the 3000 launciers in 6 little quarterets,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> 3000 <HI>lan|ciers quartered into</HI> 6 <HI>quarterts.</HI></NOTE> containing each 500 launciers; vnto euery launcier I haue giuen 3 allodgements of 50 superficiall foote <HI>per</HI> allodgement, and 1 allodgement for his place of armes; the which are in all 4 allodgements to euery Lancier. Now, I multiply the 3000 launciers by 4 allodgements, &amp; it amounteth 12000 allodgements, the which 12000 I multiply againe by 50 foote superficiall, and it maketh 600000 superficiall foote, the which 600000 superficiall foote to bring them into pases, I repart by 25, and it produceth 24000 superficiall pases. Now this 24000 superficiall pases, I deuide againe by 6 (for that I allodge the 3000 lanciers in 6 quarterets) and the product will bee 4000 superficiall pases for euery quarteret, the quadrat roote whereof being 63 little more, is the due square of pases euery way, of euery one of these 6 quarterets:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their place of armes.</HI> <GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> then againe I repart the 6000 lanciers by 6, and there co~meth forth 500 launciers to bee allodged in euery quarteret. Now to giue vnto these 3000 launciers their conuenient places of armes, I allow vnto euery 1000 launciers their place of armes co~tained betwixt two quarterets, allowing for the same vnto euery Launcier one allodgement of 50 superficiall foote; to doe the which, I multiply the 1000 launciers (which are contained within each two quarterets) by 50 foote superficiall, being the content of one allodgement, and it amounteth 50000 superficiall foote, the which 50000 superficiall foote, to bring them into pases, I deuide by 25, and it produceth 2000 superficiall pases; the quadrat roote whereof being 45 pases little lesse, is the due square of the place of armes allowed
<PB N="161" REF="86">
for 1000 lanciers, allodged within two quarterets (as in the plat appeareth) be|sides the breadth of the streets which do deuide the same, by so much enlarging euery place of armes. Thus the 3000 launciers are deuided and allodged into 6 quarterets &amp; vnto euery two quarterets is apointed their place of armes, as in the first plat of encampment may appeare.</P>
<P>Next vpon the out sides of these 6 quarterets of launciers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A streete of</HI> 15 <HI>pases broade.</HI></NOTE> and about the men at armes, and the place of victuals and market place, and lastly about the Carbines or lighthorse, haue I drawne and staked out a streete of 15 pases broade, to sepe|rate the horse companies from the foote, as by a red line there drawne will ap|peare. Then round about this said streete,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> 3000 <HI>foote|mens allodge|ment. The rule.</HI></NOTE> haue I quartered &amp; allodged the 30000 footemen into 30 quarterets, distinguished by streets of 10 pases broade, contai|ning in each 1000 footemen, and vnto euery two quarterets their place of armes. Now to do the which, I haue giuen vnto euery footman for his allodgement 64 superficiall foote of ground, and vnto euery one 32 superficiall foote of ground for his place of armes, both the which summes do make 96 superficiall foote of ground for euery foote souldier with the place of armes. This being done, I multiply the 30000 footemen by 96 superficiall foote, and it commeth vnto 2880000 superficiall foote of ground for the quarters of these 30000 footemen, the which 2880000 superficiall foote, I deuide by 25 to bring them into superfi|ciall pases (for 25 superficiall foote do make a superficiall pase) and it produceth 115200 superficiall pases. Now, for as much as I doe bestow and place these 30000 footemen, round about the Generals Pauillion and place, and wthout the ring of the horsemens quarters (for the more surer guard of the Generall, and better defence of the horsemen, who are longer time in arming then are the footemen, if the enemy should offer any suddaine attempt) and for that I thinke good to deuide them into 30 quarterets;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reparted into</HI> 30 <HI>quarterets.</HI></NOTE> I doe repart the sayd 115200 superficiall pases by 30, and the product will be 3840 superficiall pases for euery quarteret; the square roote whereof being 62 pases (litle lesse) is euery quarteret of 1000 foote|men, square by euery side.</P>
<P>Now to giue vnto euery two quarterets their place of armes, containing each quarteret 1000 footemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their places of Armes.</HI></NOTE> is in both 2000 men, allowing to euery foote souldier 32 superficiall foote for his place of armes, I doe multiply the 2000 men by 32, and it amounteth vnto 64000 superficiall foote; then to bring them into pases, I deuide the 64000 pases by 25, and there commeth out 2560 superficiall pases, whose quadrat roote is 50 and little more, the which 50 pases is the due square of euery side of the place of armes belonging vnto 2 quarterets, besides the breadth of the streete which deuideth the sayd two quarterets; for by so much the more is the place of armes enlarged. Thus are the 30000 footemen lodged, and deui|ded into 30 quarterets, containing each quarteret 1000 men; and euery square side of the sayd quarteret, doth containe 62 pases; and vnto euery 2 quarterets, is giuen their place of armes, extending each way 50 pases, besides the breadth of the streets that cutteth the same in the middest, whereby the places of armes be so much enlarged.</P>
<P>And because that the shot are more ready then the pikes, I haue placed almost all the shot in the ring of almost all the outmost quarterets,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The placing of the shot.</HI></NOTE> to bee ready to skirmish with the enemy (if he should attempt any thing) whilest the other
<PB N="162" REF="87">
foote and horse do arme themselues: the which shot being in all 15000, I haue distributed thus. In the 4 quarterets which are vpon the 4 angles of the allodge|ments, I haue placed 750 shot, &amp; into euery one of the other outermost quarters there is set 500 shot, being 20 outmost quarters, besides the 4 angles; so there is bestowed about the ring of the allodgements 10000 shot: more in the 4 corner quarterets 3000 shot; and the other 2000 shot are placed in the 4 other inmost quarterets, amongst the halberds and short weapons: finally, all the pikes are pla|ced in the quarterets within the shot; as in the first plat of an encampement doth particularly appeare.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Munition of the Artillery.</HI></NOTE>Moreouer, vpon the North east angle of the encampement, I haue desseigned the place of munition of the Artillery, of 160 pases square; and on the South east corner of the encampement,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Places for victu|alers.</HI></NOTE> is there left 2 other smaler places of 65 pases broade, and 160 pases long, seruing for victualers, butchers, cookes, bakers, and such like: and without them againe, is there another long place for horses, oxen, and cattell seruing the campe: and vpon the South side of the encampement are lodged, the wagoners, carters, laborers, &amp; some pioners: &amp; again vpo~ the North side of the en|campement,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Places of the wagoners. Place for the gunners and arti|ficers, and pioners Place of armes generall.</HI></NOTE> and by the place of munition of the Artillery, is placed first, the gun|ners, and some officers of the Ordinance, and then the carpenters, wheel-wrights, smiths, labourers, and some pioners, as there seuerally appeareth. And betwixt the place of munition of the Ordinance, &amp; the victualers place in the midle front of the encampement, due east is placed the place of Armes general, containing in breadth 280 pases, and 160 pases in length, East and West, and vpon the after front of this place of Armes generall is placed, armourers, cutlers, and such like, and at the one front of the 2 places of the victualers, cookes, and bakers, are placed taylors,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diuision of the encampement. The artillery pla|ced.</HI></NOTE> shomakers, and such like. Moreouer the encampement is deuided East, and West with 9 streets, and it is deuided North and South, with 6 streets, of which, the 2 maine streets do containe in breadth 20 pases, and the 4 others (li|ned with red, East, &amp; West, North, and South) 15 pases broade a peece, and the rest (being small streets) of 10 pases broade euery one. Finally, the ordinance is placed, about 60 pases distant from the ring of the encampement, with a good vaumure cast vp before them; and the Artillery planted vpon the same. Last of all, is there a running trenche cast round about the Campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A running trench.</HI></NOTE> about 80, or 100 pases distant without the vaumure of the Ordinance. All the which matters do particu|larly appeare in the aforesayd plat of encampement: but if this Campe were to continue any long time vpon some seat or place, then must it be more stro~ger for|tified, with deeper ditches, stronger bulwarkes, and scances, thicker <HI>terraplenes,</HI> higher <HI>caualleros</HI> and mounts, to scoure with the Ordinance round about the Campe, or otherwise fortified in such strong sort, as the prudent Camp-maister, with his skilfull enginers shall thinke good and deuise. The lodgings and tentes of the Chiefe Commanders both of horse and foote,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lodging of the commanders.</HI></NOTE> may be seated on the front of euery their places of armes. To conclude I giue aduertisement of one thing worthy noting: that there bee no slaughter house kept within the Ring of the Campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>No slaughter house kept within the ring of the campe.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>The marching and the encamping of an army being a continuate thing, the dislodging or remouing of a Campe must needes be a consequence. There|fore I will with as much breuitie, as I may conueniently, declare vnto you what I conceiue thereof; and that which hath bin seene in our time touching the same. Presupposing therefore, that there be two enemy Armies, encamped within sight one of another, or at the least not farre distant asunder, and because it is a most important matter, to know how many and sundry operations a braue man of warre or good chiefe may do, yet herein there is many considerations to be had. For although to retire by night,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Remouing by night.</HI></NOTE> and to remoue away from the enemy, doth seeme to be the surest remedy that can be found, me thinkes, notwithstanding that the same is not sufficient inough to attaine an intention with securitie, if the said reti|rer be not befriended, either with the situation, or with some other parts and con|ditions of the countrey whether he meaneth to retire. And comming vnto the particulars, I say; that when a campe remoueth and dislodgeth by night, it is need|full to vse all possible silence and diligence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Silence and dili|gence.</HI></NOTE> the which if it be not assisted with the seate, and qualities of the countrey, it is not yet inough; as hee which is to march thorough a plaine and champain countrey, &amp; in open places, and not hauing (vp|on any occasion offered by the enemy) some woods, valley, riuer, rocks, or such like, thorough the which me~ may hardly passe; but being so (as I say) it may the~ suffice
<PB N="163" REF="88">
to hold skirmish: for that the enemies horse approching may be thereby hin|dred and kept backe; but otherwise one shold be constrained to fight against ones will, with great disorder, especially carrying along the Artillery and other impe|diments of the campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To obserue good array.</HI></NOTE> the which with reason is not to bee left in pray to the e|nemy. And in like sorte it is not conuenient to march the Army out of his ordinary pace, for if a man bee ouer sollicitous and hastie therein, it would easily conioyne an euill opinion vnto the souldiers former conceipt, growne by such dislodging and retiring: a matter truly of great daunger to cause an vnremediable disorder to ensue, as many times it hath bin seene come to passe, whereas the army that pursueth the enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The pursuer.</HI></NOTE> hath not those impediments and diffi|culties: for they may leaue all impediments behind. And if the pursuer do march with speede, it is done with more desire and courage; the chieftaines vsing braue and honourable words, as in such cases be conuenient, and therefore (in mine o|pinion) the dislodging by night is not very secure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ayded by ad|uantage. Example.</HI></NOTE> vnlesse it bee (as I sayd) be|friended and ayded with some seate of aduantage: as it chaunced vnto the afore|sayd <HI>Francis</HI> the French King, when at <HI>Cambresy,</HI> he retired from the Emperour by night, that by the benefit of a great wood he might saue his Army: and hauing passed thorough the same, when the enemies horse ouertooke him, where hee made a stand; and where as well by reason of the aduantage of that wood, as by the commoditie of the seate where he stood, he might well and boldly fight with the enemy, as by experience of them of the Emperours part was seene: who ouer greedily pursuing the enemy, issued out of the wood, euen vpon his troupes, where the most part of them were slaine, or taken prisoners.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Example.</HI></NOTE>The very same case happened also vnto the protestants Army in <HI>Germany,</HI> when they would remoue and withdraw themselues from the Emperours campe, being both the Campes neare encamped together, that dislodging by night, they had not farre to march, to enter into a very strong valley, where they could not, but with the enemies great disaduantage, bee charged and set vpon: and for that there was in the same valley a little hill, the same was presently possest by the pro|testants, and planted with good store of field ordinance, and with strong troupes of foote and horse, and in such sort occupied, that what with this preparation, and with that which they made in a neare adioyning wood, planting the same full of small shot; the Emperours power could not pursue them, as they had pretended. For as soone as they were approched neare vnto them, they saw that they were retired vnto a place both by art and nature most strong: and therefore were let passe without any more annoyance. Wherefore I say, that with the fauour of the seate, and quality of the countrey, the dislodgement may be thus assured; as by the aboue recited examples may appeare.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Better to dislodge by night then by day.</HI></NOTE> And alwayes it is farre better to dislodge by night then by day, for to gaine at the least, the distance of ground, to conduct the Campe to place of security and strength:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Considerations.</HI></NOTE> for the remouing by day, without the great helpe and securitie of the seate, most commonly is very daungerous; except the Remouer should farre abound in Cauallery; and therefore the Campe, which is inferiour in horse, ought to distant himselfe, as farre as he can, from the enemy; for not, by such accidents, to be constrained either to fight vpon disaduan|tage, or commit some other foule disorder.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conclusion.</HI></NOTE>Thus haue I at large (and more large then I meant) declared vnto you, the of|fice

he haue with the Maister of the Ordinance for the supplying his store of muni|tion, as occasions and seruices of importance shall require.</P>
<P>He must know also of the Muster-maister, how the bands be furnished; what souldiers be dead or slaine; when, and how many; and how, and when supplied: deliuering pay to euery Colonell and Captaine accordingly, keeping the war|rants or notes of their hands for his discharge, and to aduise well the Muster-mai|ster to haue a good regard to the false Musters that many times be made, to the hinderance of the action, and abusing of the Prince: a fault ouer much vsed, and litle regarded.</P>

<P>VVherein is set foorth the partes to be expected in so high a Commander: the foure principall qualities which the Romanes considered in the Comman|ders of their armies; how needefull it is to haue graue and experimented of|ficers in the Campe.</P>

<SPEAKER>Captaine.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord high Generall.</HI></NOTE>_THe Generall, the Prince with the aduise of his prudent Councell, doth elect, chuse, and appoint: and being an office of highest degree and greatest charge in the field, it ought to be encommended vnto a personage indued with partes befitting the function. Therefore, as he is the Officer highest in degree, so ought he, not only to know per|fectly the partes of euery other officer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Generall partes.</HI></NOTE> but also to excell them all, in religion, wisedome, experience, policie, grauitie, secrecie, counsell, modestie, tempe|rance, valour, magnanimitie, vigilancie, care, constancie, liberalitie, and reso|lution; with all other good partes incident to a perfect man of warre: and how much all these good partes (and many more) ought to be in the personage elected to this high and carefull dignitie, by our former discourses you may easily con|ceiue and gather; to the ende that he, being their Chieftaine and head, may not

For most commonly a wise, valiant and vertuous Generall, will chuse wise, valiant, &amp; vertuous Captaines, and officers: good &amp; vertuous Cap|taines, will, as neare as they can, chuse honest, sober, and vertuous souldiers, or at the least, reforme their faults, and do their best to bring them to the due forme of Militarie discipline. And as it is very hard for euery Commaunder to haue all the good partes incident to his function, yet such as are indued with many, or the most of these partes, are best to be esteemed; and so consequently the rest. For the accidents of warre are so diuerse and manifold,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The accidents of warre are di|uerse; sometimes altering mens humours.</HI></NOTE> that it altereth many times the humours of men: except being endued with constancie and magnanimitie; which singular vertues few men possesse: but greatly to bee wished in all high Commaunders.</P>
<P>Now to discourse and reason in particular vpon the partes due to a Generall, our discourses would bee ouer long; wherefore I will name the foure principall, which the ancient <HI>Greekes</HI> and <HI>Romanes</HI> did consider in such personages as they elected to bee conductors of their Armies:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The foure princi|pall vertues con|sidered by the Romanes.</HI> 1 2 3 4</NOTE> which were, 1 to be very expert and skilfull in the Art of warre, 2 to be valiant and magnanimous, 3 to bee of great grauitie and authoritie; and 4 to be fortunate in their successes: the which parts me thinkes, a Prince ought to regard &amp; consider, in the election of his Generall.</P>

For battels are subiect vnto a thousand hazards, and perils, as to the temerity and rashnesse of heady Captaines and souldiers, and vnto the cowardize sometimes of some particulars; with a number of such accidentall fortunes: and therefore in effect, prudence and patience, and not pride and rashnesse, do produce good and happy euents in warre:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Octauius Augu|stus.</HI></NOTE> and therefore the Emperour <HI>Octauius Augustus</HI> did more esteeme the kingdome of <HI>Mauritania,</HI> then all the other prouinces which he pos|sest, for that he had gayned the same without bloud, and the king of <HI>Naples Don Alonso,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Don Alonso king of Naples.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Duke de Aniou.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A wise saying.</HI></P></NOTE> being chalenged by his Competitor and enemy, the Duke of <HI>Aniou</HI> to come to battell, he refused the same, saying; that it was the part of a good Cap|taine to knowe howe to gayne, and not to come to battell at the enemies ap|petite.</P>
<P>But this is principally to be vnderstood, when a Prince is set vpon and distressed in his own cou~try, as was then the said king <HI>Don Alonso,</HI> &amp; the case being such, let no Prince nor Generall vse the temeritie and rashnesse, as did <HI>Lewes</HI> the King of <HI>Hungaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rashnesse of Lewes king of Hungaria.</HI></NOTE> who ioyned in battell vnaduisedly with <HI>Solyman</HI> the great <HI>Turke,</HI> being badly counselled thereunto by the Archbishop <HI>Tomeres,</HI> being farre inferiour to his enemy in numbers: yea, although he were equall, yet were it better to weary him with delayes, and cause him by such lingerings to be weary of the acti|on; and so retire in fine.

For those which do measure the hope of the victory, without the due consideration of the profit or losse, that succeedes the same, doe desire vaine and disordinate things, and do find many times the euents and issues contrary to their thoughts: as it chaunced vnto the French at the battell of <HI>Poytiers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Examples.</HI></NOTE> where although they were in full hope of victo|ry, yet they lost therein a number of their nobility, with their King and his sonne

And therefore <HI>Sci|pio</HI> the younger, when being perswaded by some of his Captaines to take <HI>Numan|tia</HI> by battery and assault, he aunswered them, saying: that he esteemed more the sauing of one <HI>Romaines</HI> life, then the killing of all those within <HI>Numantia</HI>; conside|ring that the best men are commonly lost in such attempts.</P>

<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Good fortune proceedes, from experience, forti|tude, and from authoritie.</HI></NOTE> felicitie and good fortune, proceedes from knowledge, from fortitude, and from authoritie.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>I neuer vnderstood, till now, that felicitie and good fortune did consist in science and knowledge: for I haue alwayes heard say; that fortune did most fa|uour men of least wisedome, and in fine, fooles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such was the opinion amongst the Stoicke Philosophers; co~ceiuing that as there was one <HI>Prima causa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Stoickes opi|nion of fortune.</HI></NOTE> eternall, omnipotent, and of infinite wisedome, knowen and discerned by the order and harmonie of his workes: so in like sort, was there another <HI>causa,</HI> imprudent, foolish, and inconsiderate; whose operati|ons were without order, or reason, or any wisedome at all; for that, with an irra|tionall affection, it both gaue, and depriued men, of riches, dignitie and honour: the which they termed and intituled by the name of fortune; seeing her to bee a friend of men which did their matters,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>There is no other fortune, but the prouide~ce of God.</HI></NOTE> <HI>fort&egrave;</HI>; which is to say, <HI>a casu,</HI> by chaunce, without conduction either of reason or prudence. But in very truth there is none other fortune but the prouidence of God, and the valour and abilitie of man: neither any other thing that maketh men disastred, &amp; that things succeede them not, according to their desires, but onely the want of skill to practise their actions in due times; and with such conuenient meanes as the cases would require.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gentleman.</SPEAKER>
<P>_WEll (Captaine) sith you haue in your former fiue bookes at large discoursed touching most martiall pointes; as well of souldiers, offices, officers, and Commanders, as also of most sorts of imbattailing of men, now most in vse; wherein you haue satisfied vs wonderfull well: yet, I pray (according to your promise) will you now describe vnto vs their seuerall tables,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A farther request for figures and tables of battels.</HI></NOTE> and figures to the same: whereby we (which are not skilled) may reape some knowledge from thence: and so shall haue good cause to yeelde you thankes for your great paines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Although that I haue in our former discourses, declared (at large) of most sorts of imbattailing, both auncient and moderne; yet for better declaration and vnderstanding of the tables following, I must of necessity repeate a great part thereof againe.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Errors found in battell.</HI></NOTE> Touching errors found in battels (according to mine opinion) by reason of sundry compound weapons within the body of the same, I haue spoken already.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What kind of bat|tels may be held for good and firme.</HI></NOTE> Wherefore now let vs consider, and declare, what kind of battels (by rea|son) may bee held for good and firme, considering our now vsed fights, and the weapons most befitting the same, &amp; suted in so good sort as may become able to abide or performe a victory, whereunto they are appointed. Principally therfore if you will rest vpon one sole and entire battell, whether the same be square of me~, or square of ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To frame the squadron of pikes only. To empale with shot. Shot deuided in|to small troupes.</HI></NOTE> or any other proportion, or forme, as hearst, crosse battell, or tryangle: the which two first (as I haue erst before sayd) do at this present day re|maine chiefly in vse among vs: or deuide your army into many battallions of that kind, which your graund battell shall be formed of: then set your squadron of bat|tell or battallions round about vnder the guard of the pikes, with such number of shot, as shall be best fitting vnto the proportion of the same, according to the Ser|geant Maior his appointment; either by 3, 5, or 7 shot in a ranke: and the rest to be reparted into many small troupes, of 30, 40, or 50 in a troupe; trouping round a|bout
<PB N="182" REF="97">
the battel, with a reasonable distance from the same, to maintaine skirmish, which way soeuer the enemie approcheth. Prouiding that the same troupes be still maintained, one to second another, that the battell may be by them shadow|ed, to the end that the enemies troupes or skirmishers may not haue that aduan|tage to discharge vpon the body of your battell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The short weapo~ to be mingled with the troupes of shot.</HI></NOTE>Now among these your troupes of shot, it shall be very behouefull to mingle some of your short weapons, as halbards, bils, swords and targets, halfe pikes, and such like: for there shall your short weapon do best seruice, mixed with your na|ked shot, to backe them, if they should happen to be distressed by the enemy.</P>
<P>Your battell thus framed, girdled, and enuironed with shot in troupes, the which troupes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Troupes of shot one to second an other.</HI></NOTE> seconding one another, shall still keepe your battell shadowed, as in the figures of all their kinds, set downe before their seuerall tables, shall plainely appeare: alwayes regarding that your girdling shot do neuer discharge vntill the enemy commeth within 20,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The girdling shot when to discharge</HI></NOTE> or 30, pases of them at the least; and then to discharge roundly vpon the face and body of the enemy. The which being performed, if they be encountred with foote, they are speedily to retire vnto either flanke of the battell, or sleeued in betwixt the pikes, or if encountred with horse, to bend downe vpon one knee, vnder the guard and succour of the pike.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rare victo|ries of the Ro|maines.</HI></NOTE>Now hauing deepely considered the rare victories and great conquests of the auncient <HI>Romaines,</HI> atchieued (in mine opinion) by their due obseruing of true martiall discipline, and great readinesse in their politike and suddaine alterations of their proportions, wherewith to encounter their enemies, I find therein a most notable patterne of a right excellent Chiefetaine. The very circumspection of whom, by a most wonderfull regard, was cause vnto them, of so many, and such honourable victories:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The readinesse of souldiers to be transported into any forme.</HI></NOTE> wherein the continuall readinesse of their souldiers and people of war, to be transported (with all facilitie) into euerie forme, vpon anie oc|casion: and the skilfull direction of their Captaines was such therin, as to so victo|rious a people seemed to be most correspondent and conuenient. The which true discipline, obedience, skill, and readinesse, were it vsed (and more then it is) in this our age, I thinke warres would carry a farre better conduction then they now do.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The profit of true trayning.</HI></NOTE>This kind of readinesse in souldiers, and the indeuour of a continuall vse vnto them in the same, especially in the time of their trainings (the which I could wish to be put in practise with vs by skilfull trainers) vpon what chaunce soeuer shold happen, hath no doubt, seemed vnto many, to be of no small importance and force; and the rather do I so iudge, for that hauing sounded the depth and com|modity thereof, I find the contrary negligence to beare with it a note of most great imperfection. The disposition whereof, leauing vnto the knowledge and regard of euery good and expert Captaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Out of the grand square of men all battels to be redu|ced.</HI></NOTE> and for that I haue at large discoursed thereof already in my third booke of these military discourses, I will at this pre|sent content my selfe, to shew vnto you the seuerall tables and figures of all these battels and battallions, with the arithmeticall rules to frame the same; and how that out of the grand square of men, may all these battallions and battels be re|duced, and that without any great confusion. The practike rules whereof I haue, as I sayd, at large set downe in these our former discourses, as in the third booke may appeare:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In the third booke.</HI></NOTE> moreouer I haue in sundry other places particularly declared and
<PB N="183" REF="97">
the orders of the embattailing of men now most in vse, with their order of impa|ling with armed pikes, their diuisions into <HI>Maniples,</HI> and the ready reframing of them againe into their grand square, as at large in the sayd third booke appeareth in many and diuerse places.</P>
<P>Finally in the aforesaid third booke, in folio 89, and 90, and in the fourth booke in folio 99, I haue described the order to draw your army through straights, and difficult passages, by quartering the same into such proportions as the straights will permit: especially if the enemy do constraine you to fight in the same, as most commonly it falleth out:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In the fift booke.</HI></NOTE> also in the fift booke, in folio 157 is dessigned a plat of encampement, with the arithmeticall rules of the same: in the consideration of all which, the value, and waight of this readinesse, may vnto the diligent re|garders (perchance) in their seuerall descriptions, giue some manifest appeara~ce.</P>
</SP>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A declaration of the tables of battels and battallions with the arith|meticall rules to worke the same.</HEAD>
<P>In these tables following,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The tables to</HI> 10000 <HI>armed pikes.</HI></NOTE> I haue begun with the nu~ber of 10000 armed pikes; besides the shot and short weapons, correspondent to these proportions, where|of I haue before sufficiently spoken in many places: for the diuision of which number of armed pikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rules for the deuisions of the numbers.</HI></NOTE> with all numbers downe ward, I haue reduced into cer|taine tables the proportions of diuerse battels, beginning with the square of men from the said number of 10000 pikes downward, and the same not decreasing, by 50 or 100 but by roote, as first beginning with the square roote of 10000, which is 100. The which multiplied into it selfe, maketh the said 10000: and so from the roote 100 vnto 099, and then 098, next 097, and so from roote to roote orderly, vnto the last square roote, which is 1.</P>
<P>In which tables I haue directed the order of marching of an army, as the pas|sage or way will permit:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The order in marching.</HI></NOTE> whether you shall march 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, or 17 in a ranke, and how many rankes they shall be. To do the which, worke thus. Deuide the whole nu~ber of men by so many in rank,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rules to the same.</HI></NOTE> as you will haue them to march in; as by 3, 5, 7, &amp;c. The number here I haue supposed to be 10000 men, the which 10000 to haue them to march at 3 men <HI>per</HI> ranke, I do deuide 3, and it produceth 3333 rankes, and 1 man remaining, as in the margine appeareth. And if you wold haue them to march by 5, 7, 9,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> or any other number, <HI>per</HI> ranke, worke as you haue done with the number 3.</P>
<P>Then how to deuide the battell into <HI>Maniples</HI> or parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To deuide it into Maniples.</HI></NOTE> and so to march them vpon the way as strongly as the passage will permit; and how the <HI>Maniples</HI> com|ming vp shoulder to sholder, each weapo~ ioyneth with his like, making again the former square battell of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rule to do it.</HI></NOTE> with the remaines that make not vp a iust <HI>Maniple</HI> or part: and also how to march those sayd remaines that they may come vp shoulder to shoulder, with the rest of the <HI>Maniples,</HI> to make vp a iust square. To do the which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> worke thus: deuide the roote of your grand number of men by so many as you would haue them to march in a <HI>Maniple,</HI> and the product will be the number of <HI>Maniples,</HI> with the remaines (if any such there bee) as for ex|ample, the square roote of 10000, is 100, the which 100 men, I do deuide by 3 and it produceth 33 <HI>Maniples,</HI> and one ranke remaining, the which 1 ranke is 100 men, the which 100 men, marching vp by 1 in a ranke, comming vp shoulder to shoulder with the grand square, maketh iust the same proportion of the grand square; as in the Tables plainly may appeare: So may you worke by 5, 7, 9, 11,
<PB N="184" REF="98">
or any other number, to bring them into <HI>Maniples</HI> with their remaines. But here you shall note,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Maniple what it signifi|eth.</HI></NOTE> that a <HI>Maniple,</HI> doth signifie so many men in ranke quite through your grand square or battell, as you are disposed, or be constrained to deuide the sayd grand square into, whereby to passe through any straight or passage, &amp; then comming vp shoulder to shoulder, do make your former square of men againe.</P>
<P>Finally in the first table of the said square of men, in proportion of equalitie, there is set down readily how many shot will girdle or impale the battell of pikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shot to girdle the battell.</HI></NOTE> in what forme soeuer you dispose the same, whether it be by 3, 5, 7, or 9 shot in a ranke, which is as many as you shall neede to girdle withall, in mine opinion: and if you are to encounter or be charged with horse, I suppose 3 to be sufficient. To do the which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rule to the same.</HI></NOTE> worke you thus: First multiplie your quadrate roote, or square of men, by so many as you meane or bee disposed to girdle the same withall, the product whereof will amount to the girdling shot for the one side or quarter; then againe multiplie the said product by 4, for the 4 squares of the battell, and the product thereof serueth for the girdling of the sayd 4 square sides. Now there will want to fill the 4 angles or corners, the which you must consider whe|ther you doe impale by 3, 5, 7 or 9: then to multiplie euery angle by so many <HI>per</HI> ranke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="math"></NOTE> as you doe impale by: as for example: the square roote of 10000 is 100; the sayd 100 I do multiplie by 3, (for so many doe I set to impale by) and it maketh 300 for the one square side of the battell; the which 300 I doe againe multiplie by 4, for all the 4 square sides of the battell, and it amounteth vnto 1200 shot: then for the foure corners or angles (considering that I do impale by 3) first I multiplie the sayd three by it selfe, and it maketh 9 for one angle: and then quadruple the sayd 9, it maketh 36, the which 36 being added vnto the aforesayd 1200, and it a|mounteth in all vnto 1236 shot for the full impalement of your squadron of 100 square roote of men. And so may you do with any other number, as in the tables will appeare more at large.</P>
<P>Likewise on the left side of euery leafe of the sayd tables, hauing first turned the same ouer, you shall haue opposite or against the number or battell, which standeth euermore on the right side of the sayd leafe, the same battell deuided in|to 3,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To deuide the grand square in|to battallions. The order to find in the tables how the battallions be set.</HI></NOTE> 5, or 7 battallions; the number of which battallions in each of them contei|ned, you shall finde by drawing your finger euermore on the first Columne of euery leafe on the right side, &amp; where you finde the number of the said battallio~s, there shall you see in that distinctio~ betwixt two long rules, how euery battallion shall bee set, which two long rules are the second Columne of the tables: As for example: the grand battell of 10000 pikes, placed on the right side of the leafe in the first Table, as in folio 16 may be seene, the sayd grand battell you shall finde deuided into 3, 5 or 7 battallions, by turning ouer the leafe looking vpon the left side therof, in the same folio 190. Now to know the square root of euery of these battallions, draw your finger continually down the first Columne of euery right side of the leafe, vntill you come to finde the due number of the sayd battallions, which is, first 348, &amp;c. the which nu~ber being found in the first Columne in folio 191, euen there in the second Columne you shall see the square roote thereof to be 59, and so must you do by the rest of the battallions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The order obser|ued in the tables following.</HI></NOTE>In the first Columne of the left side of euery leafe, is placed the grand square or battell of men: in the second Collumne is set the same battell deuided into 3. battallions: in the third Columne is the number of euery of their seuerall battal|lions,
<PB N="185" REF="98">
and in the fourth Columne is the remaines of the sayd battallions, which is, how much they are lesse then the grand square of men: and also in the said fourth Columne, if they do abound the number of the grand square, it shall be there set downe, alwayes marked with this word (<HI>ouer</HI>) adioyning vnto it, which word when you do finde, then suppose that the battallions are more then the grand bat|tell, by so many as that number containeth. The like order is to be obserued in the diuision of them into fiue battallions, or into seuen battallions.</P>
<P>As for the reducing or inducing of all battels and battallions out of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of reducing or inducing battels or battallions out of, or into the grand square of men.</HI></NOTE> or into the grand square of men, I haue before in folio 77, 78, 79, and so forth, at large de|clared; as of the battell in Diamant proportio~, of the Triangle, of the Sheeres bat|tell and Saw battell, &amp; of the Crosse battell, &amp; battell co~pounded of many battal|lio~s, vnto the which I referre me: onely hereafter will I set down the figure &amp; Ta|bles of all, or the most of these, &amp; the order to be obserued in the same: as I will at the beginning of euery Table declare: but first I will shew you the declaration of euery Columne of the Tables, as here is described.</P>

<HEAD>Hereafter ensueth the Tables and figures of two fold Battels; called broad squares or hearst Battels: with the Battallions of that kinde.</HEAD>
<P>_IN these Tables ensuing, I haue set downe the order and setting of sundry Battels in proportio~ of inequalitie, as 2, vnto 1, that is, twise so many men in front as in flanke, the which sort of Battels do come to co~taine neare a iust square or quadrate of ground, which the bat|tels of proportio~ of equalitie (that is so many me~ in flank as in front) doe not: for they containe in ground, twise and more the quantitie of ground, in flanke or length that they doe in front or breadth; the reason and order thereof I haue in my 3. booke, in fol. 45, 46 &amp;c. &amp; 50 at large declared, &amp; so co~tinuing, shew|ing therein, rules Arithmeticall to set all such sortes of Battels, &amp; their impale|ment with armed pikes; and diuisions into <HI>Maniples</HI>: here onely contenting my selfe with setting forth the figures and Tables of the sayd Battels in proportion of inequalitie; and how they are to be ordered into ranks for marching, &amp; into <HI>Mani|ples,</HI> and girdling with shot, as before in the Tables of squares of me~, or Battels in proportion of equalitie, is at large set downe and declared. And also on the left side of euery leafe is set downe the said Battels or broad squares, deuided into sun|dry battallions of that kinde, as into 3 or 5 battallions: the number of which bat|tallions in each of them contained, you shall finde euermore in the first Columne of euery leafe on the right side; &amp; where you find the number of your battallions, there shall you see, betwixt two long rules in that distinction (placed in the 2 Co|lumne) how euery battallion shall be set in front &amp; flanke, which is the iust square roote of euery battallion. Finally, I haue here before you set downe first, the figure of the sayd broad square of men, or Battell in proportion of inequalitie, as 2 vnto 1, which commeth to containe, neare the iust quadrat of ground, girdled round about with 7 rankes of shot; and the rest of the shot, and short weapon due to this number and proportion of pikes, are deuided into sundry troupes of 50, in euery troupe, trouping round about the maine Battell; as I haue done before in the fi|gure of the iust square of men. I haue here also desseigned in figure the said broad square or hearst Battell, deuided into sundry battallions of that kinde, as first into 3 battallions, then into 5 battallions, as in page 212 may appeare: each battal|lion is girdled with 3 rankes of shot; the rest of the shot and short weapon belon|ging vnto the sayd numbers, may bee placed in sundry small troupes, as is in the broad square, trouping round about the same: or as the Sergeant Maior shall o|therwise thinke good: or as the ground will permit, or occasions offered to fight.</P>

<HEAD>Hereafter shall follow the figures and tables of sundry euen Battallions, to sundry vses, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_HEre next will I set down the Tables and figures of sundry euen Bat|tallions, as by 3, 5, or 7. euen battallio~s: the which are very strong of themselues; yet neuerthelesse may you chuse whether you will fight in the same order of battallions, or, by marching them vp shoulder to shoulder, bring the~ into a two, or threefold battell, at your owne discretion, or as occasion shall best serue. The number of which seue|rall battallions you shall finde (as I sayd before) placed in the Tables of squares of men, or battels in proportio~s of equalitie, on the right side of euery leafe, by draw|ing your finger downe the first columne of the same, and then considering what number of pikes you haue whereof to deuide your battallions, you shall finde in the 4 columne of your euen battallions, the same number set downe, or a number vnder the same, which (I thinke good) you rather chuse then the iust number, be|cause you may then cast out some remaines to imploy otherwise; for better it is to leaue then to lacke. As for example; here in these Tables of euen battallions, first there is set downe 3 euen battallions containing in each 49 pikes, which be|ing summed together doe make 174 as appeareth in page. 225. Now turne vnto the first table of battels in proportion of equalitie, or euen squares of men, &amp; loo|king in the first columne of the right side thereof, there shal you find in page 207 the said number of 49, whose square roote is 7: for 7 multiplied in it self is 49: &amp; 7 men &amp; 7 ra~ks is the square of euery of the said 3 Battallio~s. And in this sort shal you find the order &amp; setting of all the other Battallions, and of all the other num|bers: as in these figures next ensuing of 3 Battallions, co~taining in each 3364 me~, whose square roote is 58, so is each Battallion of 58 rankes, &amp; 58 men per ranke: and the whole summe of all these 3 Battallions do amount 10092 pikes, as appea|reth in these Tables following in page. 225.</P>

<P>I Haue here ensuing figured &amp; layd down diuerse euen Battallions, by 4, 8, 12, or 16, to make a Crosse battell without filling the center, so as euery 4 battallions do make a Crosse battel with center vnfilled: 8 maketh 2 Crosse battels; 12 ma|keth 3, and 16 maketh 4, without filling the center of either of them. Also there is for 5 battallions, to make a Crosse battell with the center filled, 10 to make 2, and 15 to make 3, and 20 to make 4, euen from the root of 5, which multiplied in it self maketh 25; and so vpwards vnto 1000, as by these figures &amp; tables folowing may appeare. Where in the first columne is set downe the square root of euery se|uerall battallion: in the 2 columne, the number contained in euery-seuerall bat|tallion: in the 3 columne, whether they be set by 4 battallions, with the center vn|filled; or by 5 battallions with the center filled: and in the 4 columne, the whole nu~ber contained in the whole Crosse battel. In the 5 columne, there is 8 to make 2 Crosse battels, with the center vnfilled; and 10 make 2 Crosse battels, with the center filled. In the 6 columne, the nu~ber contained in the said crosse battels. In the 7 columne is 12 to make 3, with center vnfilled; and 15 to make 3 with the center filled. In the 8 columne, the number contained in each. And in the 9 co|lumne is set downe 16 to make 4 Crosse battels with center vnfilled; and 20 to make 4 Crosse battels with center filled. The 10 columne signifieth the number of each of them Crosse battels. Note, that in the said void spaces of the 4 angles of each of these Crosse battels, is to be placed the shot belonging to the sayd Crosse battels, as in the two other small figures may appeare.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND DIALOGVE.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>VVherein is set foorth the order and rules by going pases, to know any seate or peece of ground: and how to embattell men thereupon, either horse or foote, according to the proportion of the same: with the Arithmeticall rules to the working thereof: with sundrie other martiall points.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captaine.</SPEAKER>
<P>_NOw haue I (Gentlemen) finished the figures and tables of most sorts of battels and battallions treated of in these our discourses: wherein,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>No man but er|reth, some more, some lesse.</HI></NOTE> if I haue erred (for no man but erreth, some more, some lesse, in most of our opinions and actions) I submit my labour to the courteous censure and reformation of all martiall men bet|ter experimented then my selfe, crauing of all others an indifferent iudgement; considering my intent and purpose herein, is not to instruct the experimented souldier; but to shew vnto the vnskilled and willing minded Gentlemen, the most points vsed (or well wished to be vsed) and obserued, in these our moderne warres; penned like a souldier, and not like a scholler: and so I pray you ac|cept it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly (Captaine) wee are to giue you thanks for your great care and paines taken herein, especially sith you haue, at our entreatie, and for our instru|ction done the same. And surely in mine opinion, these figures and tables may giue a wo~derful instructio~ &amp; perceiuerance vnto such, as are not thoroughly expe|rimented in most of your martial actions: &amp; may also greatly aide &amp; helpe all such martial officers as be not perfectly skilled inthe art of arithmetik; which art I per|ceiue to be more important for a souldier, then many men would iudge or deeme. And although you haue beene a long time busied in these discourses, at our request, yet let vs entreate you to aunswere some more questions and de|maundes, which yet we haue in mind to propound,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Our age incli|neth to warre.</HI></NOTE> for that we would willingly be instructed, in as much as should seeme needfull to a souldier; for we gather by your discourses, that this our age would so require it.</P>
<P>First, therefore we would gladly know the order to bee obserued to measure, only with going pases, a plat or peece of ground to martiall your men to fight, or set a battell thereupon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your demaund is good and necessary.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>To accustome the going pase to the geometricall pase of</HI> 5 <HI>foote to the pase.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The foote deui|ded into twelue inches.</HI></P></NOTE> Therefore whosoeuer would with going pases measure a peece of ground to embattell vpon, it is needfull that the skilfull souldier doe acquaint himselfe very well with pasing the measure, which is called a geometricall pase: the which measure is deuided into 5 foote of length, and euery foote deuided into 12 inches, as here is to be seene designed the fourth part of a foot; which is 3 inches (the foote being of 12 inches) as here vnder appeareth.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, to arme or imbattell a seate or peece of ground with shot, or horse, you must multiply the length of the sayd seate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To arme the sayd peece of ground with shot or hors|men.</HI></NOTE> and also the breadth of the same by 5 foote: putting downe (as is aforesayd) for the length, 50 pases, and for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">readth 40 pases: &amp; it produceth for the length 250 foote, &amp; for the breadth, 200 foote.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rule.</HI></NOTE> And now to know how many ranks, and how many shot <HI>per</HI> ranke will serue for this ground, you shall deuide the 250, and also the 200 foote by 4 foote, as be|fore is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 <HI>foote for length, and</HI> 4 <HI>foote for breadth to euery shot f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r his stati|on of ground.</HI></NOTE> to allow for euery hargubuzier his station of ground, 4 foote for length, and 4 foote for breadth. Then reparting 250 foote by 4, it produceth 50, not reckening the ouerplus: and willing to make the head of front or your battell vpon the longest breadth or part of the seate of ground, your front will come to containe 62 shot in front, and 50 rankes in flanke, as here in the figure following may appeare.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="125"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Armed with shot.</HI></NOTE><FIGURE>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The number of shot contained.</HI></NOTE>And now to know how many shot this peece of ground shall containe in this sort, multiply the 50 rankes by 62 shot, and it maketh 3100 shot, which 100 shot,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>To embattell the same with troops of horsemen.</HI></NOTE> serueth to arme the sayd peece of ground, as appeareth. And againe the like is to be done if you would embattell the sayd seate or ground with troupes of horsemen: hauing first reduced the length and breadth of the sayd seate or ground into feete, as before I haue declared, and this aforesaid seate containeth 250 foote in length,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The rule.</HI></NOTE> and 200 foote in bredth. And now if you will set the front of your horse battell vpon the length of the sayd ground, which is 250 foote, then deuide the 250 by 5 foote of breadth (as before is sayd to allow for euery horse his station in breadth of ground 5 foote) and it produceth 50 horses in ranke; and then to know how many rankes they will bee, deuide the 20 foote, by 10 foote (as aboue is allowed for the length in ground of euery horse his station, or roome) and it produceth 20 rankes, at 50 horsemen <HI>per</HI> ranke, as in the figure following shall appeare.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>And finally to know how many horsemen (after the former calculation) will serue to imbattell vpon the sayd seate of ground, you shall multiply the 50 horse by 20 rankes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The number of horsemen.</HI></NOTE> they will make 1000 horse and the sayd 1000 horse will ariue or im|battel the sayd plat or peece of ground, at 20 rankes and 50 horse <HI>per</HI> ranke. And in the like sort may any other peece of ground bee (after this ma|ner) imbattelled or armed, with either pikes, shot, or horse. And to conclude, hauing these rules perfectly in memory, and being well practised with your going pases, you may imbattell any number of men according to the seate or ground, with either foote, or horse; or with both, as occasion shall serue, and the quality of

<P>Truly so you haue; to our great contentation, and good instructions; and to your great trauell and paines: for the which wee rest greatly beholding and much bound vnto you: but (if I remember my selfe well) you haue ouer pas|sed some orders of imbattailings; whereof you made some mention before: as the Diamant, the Wedge, the Sheeres, and Saw battels: and also of the Snayle forme, the S, D, or G, battels.</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I haue abstained to speake much of these sorts of battels, because I sup|pose them to be battels of small force for any maine fight, especially as our wars are now conducted. And for the Diamant, the Wedge, the Sheeres, and Saw bat|tels, I haue sayd sufficiently of them already in my third booke, folio 77, 78, 79, and so continuing: supposing these before set downe sufficient. And if occasion fall out for the vse of the others, the very Nouices in military profession do know, that without any difficulty at all, they may easily be framed, and that sud|dainely out of the very order of marching.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The benefit of practise and rea|dinesse.</HI></NOTE> But in the others you may behold how with skilfull and orderly practise, the benefit of this readinesse shall quickly distinguish and manifest vnto vs, the parts incident vnto a right perfect souldier: which for 3 principall reasons I haue the rather deemed to be amongst vs most necessarily required.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The parts inci|dent to a perfect souldier, to be most necessary for 3 reasons.</HI></NOTE> The one is, for that the often exercise thereof inureth a souldier to such perfection as is required; another is, for that it is not meete the enemy should at any time stand assured, in what order we will fight, to the ende that he should not reape such aduantage from vs, as to frame a battell correspon|dent to any of our certaine proportions: and the third is, that according to the ground, straights, or passages, we may reduce our battell or battallions to the con|uenient proportion thereof.</P>

<HEAD>A Table, shevving the signification of sundry forraine words, vsed in these discourses.</HEAD>
<P>_GEntle Reader, for as much as in these Military discourses, I haue vsed some words and termes, somwhat straunge vnto such as haue not frequented forraine warres, nor haue anie great insight in forraine languages, I haue therefore thought good both to declare the signification of such words, and al|so to shew my reasons for vsing the same.</P>
<P>First you are to vnderstand that most of our termes now vsed in warres are deriued from straungers; as the French, the Italian, the Spaniard and the Dutch; wherin euery one almost haue their seuerall pronuntiation; therefore I hold it good, to vse such war termes and words, as we do borrow from straungers (as most languages doe borrow some, more or lesse, one of another) neare after the same nature, orthographie &amp; accent, as those nations do, from whom they are deriued: and not to pronounce and vse them o|uer corruptly, as we commonly doe. As for example. The word <HI>Caporall,</HI> which is a meere Italian, and also vsed by the French, we corruptly do both write and pro|nounce <HI>Corporall</HI>: for <HI>Caporall</HI> doth signifie the head and chiefe of a squadra, or small company of souldiers: and is an officer ensigning and gouerning (in his degree) the sayd company: and is in Spanish more aptly called <HI>Cabo de esquadra</HI> which is the head of a small squadra of 20 or 25 souldiers. And againe, wee vse both to pronounce and write, <HI>Core de guard</HI>; which by the French is written <HI>Corps de guard,</HI> and by the Italian and Spaniard, <HI>Corpo de guardia</HI>; which signi|fieth the body of a watch: the which French or Italian word I haue rather vsed in my writing, then our corrupt English terme. Moreouer wee both pronounce and write the word <HI>Canuasada,</HI> the which (in truth) ought to be written and pro|nounced Camisada, being a Spanish tearme; and doth signifie the inuesting a shirt ouer the soldiers apparell or armour; the which is vsed in the night time when any suddaine exploit or peece of seruice is to be put in practise vpon the e|nemy, vnexpected or vnseene: to the end, that in the darkenesse of the night, the attempters may thereby the better one know and discerne another. These few words and termes, I suppose sufficient for my reasons. And for the signification of all other straunge and forraine words by me vsed, I will here following parti|cularly set downe, in order of alphabet, as I shall call them to memory.</P>
