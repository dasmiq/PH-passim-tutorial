<HEAD>TO
THE CHRISTIAN
READER.</HEAD>
<P>_AS I was on my iourney from
<HI>LONDON</HI> homeward, in
the Moneth of <HI>May</HI> last, I
was ouertaken not farre from
<HI>Darnetoune,</HI> by our Coun|try-man,
M^r. <HI>Dauid Hume,</HI>
Goodman of <HI>Gods-croft.</HI>
After we had saluted one an|other,
we fell incontinent to a conference of Church-gouernment:
hee excused himselfe, that his leasure
serued him not at that time to stay in our companie,
his vrgent affaires forcing him to post before, but hee
promised to send mee his doubts in writing, and I
promised him (if it pleased the Lord) an answere. The
point I tooke in hand to proue, was, that no substan|ciall
point of Discipline was changed in our Church.
For, Ecclesiasticke Synods vsed before, are retained
still, the censures of Admonition, Suspension, Ex|communication;
yea, the Admission and Deposition of
<PB REF="3">
Pastors, or what euer else pertaynes to the matter of
Discipline; these are not remoued but rectified and
roborated: in that the power to moderate and exer|cise
these censures, is not left free to euery one, but
restored againe to the Bishop, to be vsed with aduise
of his Brethren: thus keepe wee still the same Disci|pline,
but more orderly vsed.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> dined at <HI>Darneroune,</HI> and parted in louing
manner, with all brotherly kindnes: we ouertooke him
againe at <HI>Dunbar,</HI> where not finding his former hu|manitie,
I maruelled what it could be, or from whom
it c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">me, that so small a change of the soile; should
make so great a change of the affection; for in the one
hee was most kinde, where with reason he might haue
beene more strange; and in the other most strange,
where of dutie hee both might and should haue beene
more kindly. Since that time I fore-gathered not with
him, and I expected nothing, but kindnesse from him,
and that the question should haue beene quietly and
peaceably disputed by writing among our selues, till
now that he hath begunne the publike warre. He had
sent me some missiue Letters written by him to some
others, crauing resolution of his doubts concerning
Church gouernment. And as I was dispatching an An|swere
to him, I was forced to plead for my Conscience
by <HI>APOLOGIE</HI> against a lying Libeller, which here
<HI>M^r. Dauid</HI> against all dutie and reason hath publicke|ly
impugned. First, because I stood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ound by promise
to giue an answere to himselfe, and reason would hee
should haue expected it: yea doubtlesse he had gotten
<PB REF="3">
it long ere now, in more quiet and louing manner, if
he had not interrupted me. Secondly, I had written
nothing against <HI>M^r. Dauid,</HI> I touched him not in my
<HI>Apologie,</HI> and no other way gaue I him any cause to
write against mee. Thirdly, hee being a priuate man,
it cannot be but a great Presumption to condemne by
publike writing a Church-gouernment established by
Law and that without knowledge (if himselfe be true)
for he professeth to seeke instruction concerning it,
yea, without eyther calling or lawfull commission.
Fourthly, before euer he sent this Refutation of this
<HI>Apologie</HI> to me, or had discharged with me, he pub|lished
sundry Copies of it to be seene and read of others,
which in our Prouerbe we call <HI>Treason vnder trust|ing.</HI>
Fiftly, his whole Admonitorie Treatise is full
of Inuectiues <HI>in personam,</HI> without regard of mode|stie,
yea, of that feare of God which becommeth a
Christian, bringing nothing, or else very little <HI>ad
propositum.</HI></P>
<P>Thus hath <HI>M^r. Dauid</HI> kept no faire warre with
mee, but hath very farre ouer-seene himselfe, and
wronged mee, which that the indifferent may know,
I haue here published his <HI>Admonition</HI> in his owne
words and mine answeres. I haue omitted no materiall
thing in it; onely words of needlesse repetition where|in
hee abounds. If hee had contented himselfe to iusti|fie
the Libeller, in tramping my Name, my Conscience,
my Ministrie vnder his feete, it had beene a proofe of
my patience great enough. But where without reason
or truth, he will beare downe a common cause, and
<PB REF="4">
increase offences in the hearts of simple people, I can|not
of conscience suffer it vnanswered: specially, see|ing
vnder pretence of impugning mee, hee directly
impugneth it. If my heart in this had reproued mee
of my wayes, I might haue lurked in secret, and past
ouer the Libeller, and him also with silence; but an
honest conscience feareth not the light, but rather re|ioyceth
in it. Onely I craue of the modest minded
Christian, that if my speeches in the <HI>Answere</HI> at any
time be sharper then becommeth, it be imputed to
humane infirmitie, whereunto the loue of the cause,
and knowledge of mine owne innocencie hath carryed
mee, not want of loue toward him or others. It is no
pleasure to mee to offend any man: if any such haue
escaped mee, I will not excuse my selfe in that which
the wise, godly, and indifferent Reader shall thinke
may iustly be reprehended.</P>

<P>2 It is a difficult thing to liue in a publike calling, and not to be calum|niated.
So long as our Sauiour liued a priuate life, we reade not that he was
<PB REF="5">
either tempted by Satan, or traduced by men, but from the time that by Bap|tisme
he was consecrate to doe the great worke of the promised <HI>Messiah,</HI> then
Satan set vpon him, and the mouthes of all his cursed instruments were
opened to blaspheme him. Now we know that the seruant is not aboue the

doe it all my dayes, and no man bite mee or reproue me for it, but now be|cause,
according to the saying of our Sauiour, I labour in a spirituall calling,
to nourish my selfe and others with that bread of life which perishes not, a
double error is enforced vpon me, <HI>Virum egregium sequitur proximorum inuidia,</HI>

<P>3 With the like of these weapons hath Sathan fought against mee in his
peeuish instruments, euer since the Lord called mee to be a Preacher, and no
maruaile, Shall a man trample on a Serpent, and not looke to be stinged?
I haue professed my selfe, by the grace of my Lord, a disquieter of Sathans
Kingdome, I thinke it not strange if hee doe what hee can to disquiet mee,

<P><PB REF="5">
4 O, forsooth, yee were once otherwayes minded concerning Church-gouernement.
In some things, I confesse, I was, in others not. Paritie in
Church-gouernment I euer thought the Mother of confusion, neither can, I
see that God hath beene the Author of it in any of his workes, yea by the di|uersitie
of his gifts he declares that hee allowes not equalitie in gouernment,
where here, if any strife be about comparison of gifts, I haue no more to say,
but that hee who in humilitie of minde cannot submit himselfe to obay any
other, was neuer meete to bee a Ruler of others, how great so euer has
gifts be.</P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>
<P>And that Preachers should haue place in Parliament, to giue light out of
the holy Oracle, to the Prince and States of the Kingdome, I euer thought
it both reasonable and necessarie, and did by my publike voice approue it in
that generall assembly holden at <HI>Dundie,</HI> wherein this matter was first mo|tioned.
And in these publike Lectures which once in the moneth wee had
in our Presbyteriall exercise, for clearing the Controuersies of this time: I
did in my course openly declare, how in Church-gouernment a happy meane
were to be wished betweene Anarchie and Monarchie, two fearefull euils
in the Church, the one proceeding from paritie, wrought confusion, as
might be seene in the pitifull state of the Churches of Flanders: the other
breeding tyrannie and all sort of oppression: a lamentable proofe whereof
we might see in the Churches of Italy, and other parts vnder the dominion
of that Romish Vsurper: thus is there not so great a cause to charge me with
a change, as is alleaged.</P>
<P>5 But in that wherein before I misliked Episcopall gouernment, fea|ring
least tyrannie&punc; libertie, and other euils should follow it, if now, percei|uing
a Christian King most carefull out of his rare pietie and wisedome, to
see it vsed vnto the right end, I haue changed my minde, as many others,
both worthie Fathers, and brethren in our Church haue done, to whom the
world cannot denie an honest testimonie: what imputation should this be
vnto me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambros in Psal. 119.</NOTE> <HI>Cum mentem in melius mutare non leuit as sit sed virtus,</HI> sith for a man
to change his minde to the better, it is no leuitie nor inconstancie, (as the
lying Libeller termes it) but vertue? Episcopall gouernment was embra|ced
of this Church ere I was borne, and with it wee enioyed the Gospell
for many yeares, and some that were worthie and faithfull men in this
same Ministrie of <HI>Perth,</HI> wherein I haue now laboured by the grace of God
almost this twentie yeares, did discharge (in effect) the same office of a
Bishop in the bounds of <HI>Galloway,</HI> yea by imposition of their owne hands
did ordaine Bishops of other Dioces. If there were then a reason, why the
Episcopall gouernment once embraced, being fallen in decay, the Presby|teriall
should be established, is it not now possible (thinke ye) to get a rea|son
why both of them should be reunited, the one of them being ordained
<PB REF="6">
to honour and strengthen the other, and being reduced to that order and
vse, for which anciently it did serue in the Primitiue Church. Especially
seeing it is done by the fatherly fore-cast and prouident care, (not without
warrant of Gods word, example of the Primitiue Church, nor aduice of the
present Church) of such a King as God hath giuen vs, a Professor, a Con|fessor,
a Semi-martyt, a Protector, a Preacher, a Propagator of the Gospell
with vs, whose power, for any thing I can yet learne, is greater in the ex|ternall
gouernment of the Church, then we haue well considered of.</P>
<P>6 O but, say you, by this change, the people are made vncertaine of their
Religion? This cannot be but the bolt of some enemie, or the birth of the
braine of some friend ouer-farre miscaried with opinion. If it hath done euill
to any, it is an argument, their light is weake: for why? doth diuersiue of
externall gouernment import a difference in Religion? Are there not many
famous Churches in Europe, flourishing this day vnder the Episcopall go|uernment?
haue not many Bishops themselues beene honoured with the ho|nour
of Martyrdome, and sealed the truth of the Gospell with their blood,
since the reformation of Religion: <HI>Latmer, Ridley, Cranmer,</HI> and many moe
in our neighbour Church may stand for examples. I will beseech all such
weake Christians to take none offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. Confess. Art. 7.</NOTE> where it is not giuen. <HI>Ad v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">itate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
fidei sufficit vt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">adem sit doctrina Euangelij &amp; Sacramentorum administratio:</HI> It
is sufficient for the vnitie of faith, that the Doctrine of the Gospell and Sa|craments
be one and the same: in other externall things, there may be diuer|sitie,
yea often times the diuersitie of times, and states of people will require
a diuersitie of externall things, for the furtherance of the worke of edifi|cation.</P>
<P>7 The Apostles did all teach one, and the selfe-same Doctrine, but did
not all gouerne their Churches in one and the selfe-same manner: for <HI>Iames</HI>
and <HI>Peter</HI> among the Iewes tolerated Circumcision, which <HI>Paul</HI> among the
Gentiles would not doe; yea, the Disciples of S. <HI>Peter</HI> and S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> testifie
how these blessed Apostles kept the Feast of the Pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ouer on diuers dayes,
as both <HI>Eusebius</HI> and <HI>Socrates</HI> doe write: yet was this diuersitie no impedi|ment
to the propagation of the Gospell by them both. It is euer to be con|sidered,
what the worke of edification requires. For that kinde of externall
gouernment which some Churches of Christ hath, and others hath not:
shall there be entertained a Schisme in our Church? and an vnnecessarie and
vnkindly contention, betweene a Christian people, and their most Christian
King. Since to speake in most modest termes, to giue contentment to such
as are not contentious, there is no question of Faith in the Church of Scot|land
(Christian people might be ignorant of this disputation about Disci|pline,
&amp; come to heauen neuerthelesse, if so it might please some of their Pa|stors)
neither is there a question betweene good &amp; euill, but betweene good
and better; betweene two, whereof either of them haue had their course to
be, when the other was not; euen in this same Church, I doubt not, the iudi|cious
Reader will consider this, &amp; Wisedome shall be iustified of her children.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
8 But here I know it is obiected by men, euen of moderate mindes, if
such gouernment were better vsed, and these who haue receiued it, did more
good with it, then it would soone purchase credit to it selfe, and be the bet|ter
liked. These men I see haue nothing against the thing it selfe, but against
the vse of it, by which kinde of argument now commonly it is impugned.

thus is it the manner of men to blame readily where they loue not.</P>
<P>9 But to goe further with them, as with all reason I require, that the
faults of persons be not imputed to their Offices; so with my heart doe I
wish in all that are imployed with Ecclesiasticall authoritie, so moderate a
behauiour, that no offence should be giuen to the weake, nor cause of con|tradiction
to the contrary minded: but that as <HI>Iosephs</HI> preferment, tending
to the good of all his brethren, forced them, who enuied it at the first, to
thanke God for it at the last: euen so, credit may be conquest to vs in the
hearts of them that feare God, by feruent and faithfull aduancement of the
Gospell of Christ Iesus. We should neuer forget that warning which <HI>Ierome</HI>

in others, nor esteeme that there is greater waight in other mens
traducing, then in his owne testimonie.</P>
<P>12 Now here I know it is expected, that as I haue declined the causes
falsly imputed to me, so I should declare the true causes that moued me, which
now shortly are these.</P>
<P>13 First, I perceiued a Christian King, by all meanes possible, seeking
the aduancement of the Gospell, for the which it is griefe enough that his
Maiestie sustaineth the greatest hatred and contradiction of the aduersaries,
but more then enough, his Highnesse should want the comfort of his subiects,
professors also: which when I considered, I thought it a matter of consci|ence
to refuse to serue and follow his Maiestie in so good a course.</P>
<P>14 Secondly, I saw the weake hearts of many well affected Christians,
through misconception, offended at the very name of a Bishop, not able out
of light and knowledge to giue any reason of their misliking, notwithstand|ing,
though it be so highly honoured by the Apostle, and commended by
the famous lights of the Primitiue Church, who not onely accepted the
name, but exercised the office thereof, to the great good of the Church: and
that this offence might be remoued, at least so farre as my credit may carrie
me, I haue embraced it.</P>
<P>15 Thirdly, I perceiued a perillous Schisme, and vnnecessarie diuision in
our Church, for this matter of gouernment, to the great aduantage of the
common Aduersarie, which gap I resolued, for my owne part, not to enlarge
by contention, but so farre as my weaknesse may to close it vp, at least to
make it the lesse.</P>
<P>16 Fourthly, I considered, that the same reason, that of old forced the
Fathers of the Primitiue Church, in the iudgement of <HI>Ierome,</HI> to induce this
gouernment in the Church, that is, in <HI>Remedium Schismatis,</HI> did more then ma|nifestly
require that it should be restored vnto vs: but of this the lesse I
speake for duties sake, the more I leaue to be considered of them, who know
the truth hereof.</P>
<P>17 Fiftly, the question among vs when I searched as narrowly as I
could, is about Ierusalems wall, whether it should be circular or quadrangu|lar,
round or foure-squared: so the Citie be well, is this a matter for which we
<PB REF="7">
should make contention, it being better for the good of the Church, that any
one of them should be, then that thus they should striue together, to the
great hinderance of the Gospell.</P>
<P>18 Sixtly, and I doe verily thinke that the most famous and reformed
Churches in Europe, who want this gouernment, would be glad to accept it,
vpon this condition, that with it they might enioy the puritie of the Gospel,
which they haue with vs, together with that libertie, fauour and protection
of a Christian reformed King, which we haue, and they want.</P>
<P>19 For these reasons, as I was determined before, in the priuate calling
of a Preacher, to reuerence and obey others my brethren, clad with the of|fice
of Bishops, the proofe whereof I gaue in these Prouinciall assemblies, mo|derated
by Bishops, whereat I was bound to be present, so haue I at length
embraced it in my owne person, being called there-vnto by the most Chri|stian
King, and Church of this Kingdome, without any motion, affection,
or petition of mine owne (if there be so much charitie in my aduersaries as
to beleeue me) I could with greater contentment and willingnesse of minde,
haue giuen obedience in all dutifull submission to any of my brethren, nor to
haue had any more publike charge in the Church (if the matter had beene in
my choice.) And this doe I witnesse out of the very truth and simplicitie
of mine heart.</P>
<P>20 If <HI>Shimei</HI> still will raile, and charge mee with a corrupt affection, let
him be doing till his owne iniquitie reproue him, I am sure no well aduised
Christian will fight with any such armour, for the weapons of our warfare
are not carnall, but spirituall. As for others, who like barking Dogges and
Birds of the night, chatter to themselues in secret confused sounds, which
can bide no triall, back-biting those whom they dare not looke in the face,
for such as these, why shall a man turne out of the way? It is a sufficient pu|nishment
to such as this way with their will would hurt mee, that against
their will they shall helpe me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. cont. liter. Petil. lib. 3. c. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Qui volens detrahit same mee, nolens additmer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters">
meae,</HI> For he that with his will empaites my name, against his will, shall en|crease
my reward.</P>
<P>21 But if such busie idle-bodies will come and labour with mee in the
worke of God, I hope to teach them to bestow their time more profitably,
not to disquiet, as they do, their vnsetled braines with such vanities, as vanish
so soone as they are conceiued, and brought forth, leauing nothing behinde
them but a guiltinesse to themselues, for mine owne part I haue determined
not to be contentious, for that is not the custome of the Church of Christ,
but haue resolued to spend my time and talent I haue saued to the vantage of
my Master, and good of my Brethren, after my weake measure, <HI>Aur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us vtlu|teas
minuat sic malleus vrnas.</HI></P>
<P>22 As for others my Brethren, whom I loue in the Lord, and will al|waies
reuerence for the graces of God in them, I wish from my heart that
precept of the Apostle were fulfilled in vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1.</NOTE> That wee did all speake one
thing, and there were no dissension among vs, but that we were knit together
<PB REF="8">
in one minde, and one iudgement, for since the first beginning of this que|stion,
I euer thought it a lamentable thing, that they whose hearts are ioy|ned
in one resolution to die for Christ, if so the Lord should call them vnto
it, cannot liue together in the vnitie of one minde. But this hath in all ages
beene Sathans policie, where hee cannot disturbe the peace of the Church
with externall euasion, he creepes in like a subtile Serpent, to disquiet it with
internall perturbation, &amp; that oft-times vpon vnnecessarie or small occasions:
where-vpon hath proceeded this great rupture in Ierusalems wall heere a|mong
vs, which as it is seene of vs all, and more then enough talked of by
many, so would to God, our hearts did pitie it, and all of vs endeuoured by
humbled hearts toward our God, by meekenesse of minde, euery one of vs
toward another, to repaire and close it vp againe. And seeing such in the
condition of our humane infirmitie, that our knowledge in this life is but in
part, and so our iudgements in all things cannot be vniforme, let vs take heed
to the next, that difference of iudgements worke not distraction of affecti|ons,
remembring that the wisedome which is from aboue, is peaceable, and
that the zeale of God fights not with the weapons of flesh, such as hatred,
debate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 1.</NOTE> emulations, wrath, contentions. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> we liue in the Spirit, let vs also walke
in the Spirit,</HI> expressing the fruits of it in our liues, which are, loue, ioy, peace,

any light comming from his Maiestie toward me. But
hauing read it, I found it to be but <HI>inanis, &amp; inanimis

warnes me by his letter sent with it, that I should not
receiue it, as priuate, but publicke, because (forsooth) a
publicke matter must be publickly handled, with many

admired, yea adored, as if it were some new <HI>Apollinis

it being hard to keepe such wilde Warriours in rule,
as here he hath hired against me. I haue gone through
them with order, and reduced them to foure ranckes:
raylings, first against my <HI>Name.</HI> 2. against my <HI>Consci|ence.</HI>

cloathed with the office of Bishops. In the end,
he commeth more modestly to enquire of the cause,
and there by Gods grace, hee shall finde me, as modest
as he seekes me, readie with words of sobernesse and
truth, to resolue him, if hee be readie with like affe|ction
to receiue it. But as to his behauiour in the be|ginning:
I vvould truly haue dealt vvith him <HI>in the

hee a Sheepe of the Flocke: since hee hath shewed
mee the sore, and protests in vvord hee is content
I should cure it: Since I see his corruption so grosse,
and that the canker thereof is like to eate him vp, I
cannot of dutie but apply the greatest, the sharpest

<P>But where your reproaches are not priuate, nor
personall onely, but publicke, concerning the whole

are vnder, such names and stiles as they deserue: for
the cause is common, and the Ministrie of a publicke
Office-bearer in the Church, is for the benefit of o|thers,
where it is good, and honest, the defaming of it,
is not without the preiudice of many, that should re|ceiue
good by it. In this you haue degressed so inordi|nately
out of the compasse of Christian dutie, that I
am forced to come to you with a fire from God, to
burne vp, extinguish and vndoe your vncouth fire, and
with an holy anger, as the hammer of God, to beate
downe the horne of your pride. That same holy Spi|rit,
which at one time descended in the likenesse of a
Doue, at another discended in the similitude of Fire.
Meekenesse alway is not to be vsed: there is a time
when it becommeth <HI>Moses,</HI> the meekest man of the
earth, to be angrie. I dare not say I can rule anger, as
he did, but shall doe what I may to restraine it. I know
then onely is anger good, when it is a seruant to rea|son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil. Ser. de ira.</NOTE>

arise vnto you, it is not by my deede, you haue drawne
it vpon your selfe. As the dirt which the Sea foames
and casts vp in her flowing, returnes backe againe
without difficultie into her owne bosome in the eb|bing:
so is it, beleeue me, with you; you haue here but
foamed out your owne shame, your reproaches and
calumnies, which you haue here heaped vp, and daw|bed

my rebuke, but your owne, returning vnto you.</P>
<P>You haue drawne me from mine accustomed course <MILESTONE N="8">

It had beene greater pleasure to mee, and profit to o|thers,
I had spent this time vpon some other subiect,
meeter for edification of the soules of men, and doubt|lesse
or now I had done so, if you had not interrupted
me: but since you haue kindled a fire in the Church,
and your selfe falne into it, and like to draw others
with you into it also, I will not be so vndutifull as
to leaue any thing vndone, that I may doe to quench
it. And if in pulling you out of this fire, I handle you
more roughly then otherwise I would, and my spee|ches
be sharper then you like wel of to heare; yet I hope
to speake nothing against your selfe, but against your
sinne, not to seeke a fault in you by searching your
conscience, but to rebuke it, where you by word plainly
manifest it: and in this if not you, yet at least the Chri|stian

<P>A name, sayes your Doctors, should be despised, or

not by Apologies. The first is true, no man denies it,
a good name should be procured by good deedes, but
why seclude you the second? Are not Apologies law|full,
yea needfull, to conserue a good name, begotten
of good actions, when an euill tongue would destroy
it? For why? will good actions stop the mouthes of
backbiters? Will innocencie it selfe fence a man against
the strife of tongues? No, it kept not <HI>Iesus the iust</HI>
from the scourge of the tongue. Was not <HI>Samuel</HI> an
vnrebukeable man among men, yet forced to vse <HI>Apo|logie:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 12. 3.</NOTE>
<HI>Behold, here am I, beare record of me before the Lord,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
whose Oxe haue I taken? or whose Asse haue I taken? or
whom haue I done wrong to? or whom haue I hurt? or at
whose hand haue I receiued any bribe to blinde mine eyes
therewith?</HI> M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI> many a time in your admonito|rie,
you charge me for a corrupt louer of gaine: but I
adhere to <HI>Samuels</HI> protestation before the Lord against
you, and against all creatures. I could tell at how ma|nie
hands I haue refused gaine, euen for a shew of vn|godlinesse,
but that creature was not, is not, that can
conuict me of receiuing it. And was not Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> a
faithfull seruant of God, a painefull man in the worke
of the Ministrie, yet compelled to plead his cause by
Apologies before men. What shall I say, the Christians
of the primitiue Church were men of a godly life, yet
so sore oppressed with calumnies that <HI>Iustin, Tertullian,</HI>
&amp; other Fathers of the Church were forced to defend
them by Apologies? A worthy, constant, and couragi|ous
man of God was <HI>Athanasius:</HI> was he not without
cause accused as a <HI>Murtherer and Sorcerer,</HI> that he had
slain <HI>Arsenius,</HI> &amp; cut off his right arme, to vse it in witch|craft,
and so forced to purge himselfe by Apologie?</P>
<P>And is not this it, which I tolde you so clearely in <MILESTONE N="14">
mine Apologie, but that you can see nothing, which
pleaseth not your humour? I tell you it now therefore
ouer againe: It is Satans policie to staine the Name,
where hee cannot corrupt the Conscience; and to dis|grace
the person, by contempt of men, where he can|not
dishonour them, by trapping them in his owne
snare. Sore hath mine aduersarie thrust at mee, from
my young yeeres, by change of tentations hath hee
sought to winnow mee, if you had read my little Dia|logue,
it could haue told you I haue beene trained vp
with the wrastlings of GOD. Many wayes hath the
Enemie sought to snare me, that he might shame me,
and in shaming me, might shame the glorious Ministrie
<PB N="12" REF="14">
committed to me, though least, and vnworthiest of all
his seruants: But my Lord prayed for mee, and his
grace preserued me, that Satan got no vantage against
mee, to the disaduantage of the Gospell: but now hee
hath changed his battell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> and heere is the point; <HI>what
Satan could neuer obtaine of mee by inward tentation, hee
would make the world beleeue by outward calumnie, that he
had obtained it, and that he had made me a man of a corrupt
conscience, and of an vnhonest heart toward God and man.</HI>
Before he fought against mee with inward tentations,
and I resisted him by instant prayer; now he impugnes
me by outward calumnies, he hath not, I thanke God,
corrupted my conscience, but he would make men be|leeue
that he had done it: and here it offends M^r. <HI>Da|uid,</HI>
I should resist the enemie, and defend my selfe by
Apologies: Since he hath changed the manner of his
on-set, why may not I change the manner of my De|fence?
for in all this I take him for my principall
partie.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14"> Thus stands the question betweene Satan and mee,
and I am sorie for you that you come in to second
him, and serue him for an instrument to carie his lies
vpon the chariots of your tongue and penne, to the

truth: this is the place vvherein you stand at this

If this inward testimonie of mine owne heart sustai|ned

<P>The discipline of the Church of Scotland, is not <MILESTONE N="17">
oppugned by Bishops, as you would make the simpler
sort beleeue; but rather it is stablished, and confirmed
by them. Neither will you euer be able to proue, that
the discipline of our Church at any time disalloweth
the office of Bishops, but onely fights against the cor|ruptions
thereof, as the monuments of our Church,
search them when you will, shall make manifest vnto
you. And if you be able to make it good, that it is a
hurt to a family, to haue a kindely Father ruling ouer
it, then may you also proue that it is a harme to the
Church, to haue an honest Bishop president in it?
This is for the honour and name of the Church of
Scotland, which now I maintaine according to truth,
and set it downe in this assertion.</P>
<P>The Church of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> with the puritie of Doctrine,
not stained with any blot of Heresie, hath also kept a sound,
and constant forme of gouernement, without alteration of any
point of Discipline in substance, mending onely some circum|stances,

edification of the Church.</P>
<P>This is the point I promised to cleare vnto you, I <MILESTONE N="18">

<P><MILESTONE N="21"> It became you rather of Christian dutie (if you

things externall, God knowes it is with our mutuall
griefe: where consonance is, as blessed be the Lord it
is in all points of Faith, it is with our mutuall ioy. And
since the beginning of this Controuersie, I did euer
thinke it a lamentable thing, to see such as agree in
vnitie of faith, disagree in a matter of Discipline, and
that those who could happily haue concorded on a

thus vnnecessarily discord for a question of externall

worke of this Vnion in his hands. A powerfull instru|ment
of the Lord was hee to conserue puritie of Do|ctrine
by his singular constancie, with peace among
Preachers by his godly wisedome: for this was he re|nowned,
as <HI>Columen Ecclesiae</HI> in his time. Many times
was hee banished by deceit, and often-times forced to
flie, to eschew the furie of his enemie: but none of all
his sufferings purchased him such commendation as
this, that when hee came home, and found a Schisme
among the Fathers of the Church, for a greater cause
then any that is among vs (praised be God) yet he hap|pily
composed it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazian&punc; de laude Athan.</NOTE> <HI>Vtra&abque; enim parte leniter &amp; humane

For calling both the parties with meekenesse and loue

was no difference, the diuersitie was about words, the

leauing vnto them free the vse of the words &amp; names,

<P><MILESTONE N="43"> But the string you harpe most vpon, is my incon|stancie,

probations, of that whereof in mine Apologie I haue
made a plaine confession, because say you, I haue not
beene cleare in that point to declare from what, and
vnto what I had changed: but M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI> I supposed
I had spoken more clearelie then you desired me; and
if yet you wil haue it more plainelie explained to you,
here it is. In my younger yeares I misliked Episcopall
gouernement, not hauing studied the question of

But M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI> it was spoken to one, and it stands for
all: <HI>Attende lectioni, intentus esto tibi ipsi &amp; doctrinae.</HI>
Take heede vnto learning. <HI>Timothie</HI> had learned the

haue him to learne still, for so saith he to him,
<GAP DESC="foreign">, that it may be manifest to

<P>O, but this Inquisitour will not take this for an an|swere,<MILESTONE N="46">
he will needes haue me guiltie of negligence and
sloath in my calling, <HI>That in so great, so high, so speciall a

matter, till now of late.</HI> M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI> my calling is to be a
Preacher: my commission is the whole word of God,
whereof I acknowledge with <HI>Augustine, Tantam esse

quickest Engine, though hee should liue <HI>Methusalems</HI>
yeeres, and doe no other thing but read it continually,
yet vvere not able to plum it, nor to learne all the
great, and high, and speciall questions concerning it.
There are many points in holy Scripture, which most
excellent Preachers know not, and will you for that
conuince them, either for false Teachers, or carelesse
Students. Know you not that <HI>Iacob</HI> at the first vvas
called <HI>Israel,</HI> the one <GAP DESC="foreign">, the
other <GAP DESC="foreign">:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Philo</HI> de Temu|lentia.</NOTE> the one a name of learning and pro|fiting,
the other of perfection and preuailing? Now
is the time of our wrastling, a time wherein we should
learne and grow in knowledge, <HI>Encreasing</HI> with the <HI>en|creasings</HI>
of GOD, stepping forward euery day a new
<PB N="42" REF="32">
step, and so walking till we appeare before the face of
our God in Sion. The time is at hand, when wee shall
come to the measure of perfect men in Christ: No
darknesse, no error shall then be left in our mindes, but
we shall then know euen as we are knowne.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="47"> But it being a principall point of your calling, and
you so long a Pastor, saith the admonent, it cannot
be but a great sloath, that you haue neuer searched to
know the truth of that matter. Truly M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI> I doe
verily thinke, that a man may proue both a faithfull
and fruitfull Minister in the Church all his daies, and
neither busie himselfe, nor his people with any questi|on
of externall Church-gouernement that is amongst
vs. I thanke God, being now a man neere-by of four|tie
and sixe yeeres, I haue liued in the Church twenty
and foure yeeres a Pastor, without rebuke of any till
the Libeller, and you yoaked against me, and beleeue
me, if this matter of Church-gouernement had not
beene wakened to mine hand, and the compassion I
carie to this Church, wherein I was borne a Christian,
and honoured to be a Pastor, whose bowels are vnna|turally
rent by vnnecessarie contention of some of her
vnkindely children: If these reasons, I say, had not
moued mee, I thought all my daies few enough to
spend in the matter of Doctrine, as being of greatest
importance for edification of the Church, and where|in
I haue found greatest comfort to mine owne heart,
remembring that vvarning of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Vita breuis ars longa,</HI> And in this,
though I haue not come with such speede as I would,
yet that I haue neither beene sloathfull nor carelesse, I
haue some workes for my witnesses, which how weake
so euer they be in themselues, or little worth in your

haue found comfort to mine owne heart, and others

<P>And where you tell me, I could not but know <HI>this <MILESTONE N="48">
same matter to haue beene agitate before in the persons of
Bishops, Adamsone, and Montgomrie:</HI> This is like all the
rest of your bold and rash assertions, for they vvere
both dead ere euer I was called to be a Preacher, and
what you would haue mee to learne at them, I can
hardly coniecture: for if the equitie of their cause was
obscured, either by the iniquitie of their actions (which
I know not) or the violent course of that time, what
is this to the matter now in hand. The one of them I
neuer saw that I know, the other I heard when I was
verie young at Schoole in S^t. <HI>Andrewes,</HI> and now must
tell you, that if you were either so learned, or such a lo|uer
of learning as you pretend, you would haue spa|red
to rake the ashes of the one, for the honour of his
learning. There vvere sundrie other Bishops in this
Church beside them, who liued and died honest men,
and vnrebukeable; but you passe by them, still like the
venomous Flie that lights vpon the sore part, as if the
faults of one or two were sufficient to discredit all the
rest of the fellowship. And I cannot meruaile how still
you obiect the example of two, as vndoubted proofes
in your consistorie, to improue the honestie of all the
rest. Since in mine Apologie, I remitted you to three
renowned Bishops in our neighbour Church, <HI>Latimer,
Ridley, Cranmer,</HI> lately, euen in our Fathers daies ho|noured
vvith the honour of martyrdome, that you
who cannot endure to see any honour vpon a Bishops
head, may lay downe your combe of contempt, and
thinke more honourably of them. This cannot be
but an euill affection in you, that you haue an eye to
<PB N="44" REF="33">
see the euill of the one, and not an eye to see the good|nesse
of the other: Nay, you will not suffer it to be
thought, that such grace, or godlinesse, or conscience
can be in a B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">shop, as to make him a worthie Martyr
of Christ; but rather, which I told you before, as the
ignorant Gentiles were seduced of olde, to esteeme it a
iust cause of persecution of a man, if he had once been
named a Christian: so are the simple people abused
by you, and such as you, to disdaine a Preacher, were
he neuer so honest otherwise, if once he be named a

you thinke to trie your manhood in the killing of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e,

breake the band of brother-hood and loue, for small
causes, or rather conceits. What pittie was it to see such
a Schisme in the Church of Constantinople, for the

of Ierusalems Church, as to separate them|selues

Looke to them I pray you and see: did I purge

not lawfull for mee to tell him (without your rebuke)
that hee had done mee wrong in charging mee with a
fault which hee had not found in mee. See you not

But, say you, the first Inquisitour searched not well e|nough,
and what he left vndone, you are come to doe,
and you doubt nothing to finde Idols, and truly if any
be, I thinke indeede you may best doe it. The Libel|ler

your owne speech will lead vs ere it be long. You
grudge at the persons, it will be found so; yet you pre|tend

that Bishoprie is a noysome weede, a barren tree,
that neuer bare good fruit, and neuer will: but that it

Many famous Bishops haue beene fruitfull trees in the

wherein you will be disproued also, yet it agrees with

in reuerence, by the care of Bishops, where it was not
knowne before, in such bounds as haue not beene vi|sited

Will you inferre of this an equalitie among them?
All Christians are called Kings and Priests to their

<P><MILESTONE N="79"> And thinke you that the name of a <HI>Bishop,</HI> when it

in the pith of signification, the one being but a Latine
word, expressing the equiualent of it in Greeke? and
as their names are one, so their powers also are one;
as you will finde hereafter declared by act of generall

not to enlarge by contention, but to close vp so farre,
as my weakenesse may. This offends Mr. <HI>Dauid,</HI> and

downe his conceit of gouernement, or suffer others to

<P>And to couer his nakednesse, hee hath shapen a

any man, or any Church on earth without errour: and
are there not sundrie errours not so pernitious to the
Church as Schisme? Speake plainely to the people, if
any false Doctrine be in the Church, warne them that
they may beware of it, but where vnder the name of
errour in generall, you would make the people be|leeue,
that they were seduced in the faith. M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI>
you are but a Master-deceiuer, and since you professe
you will defend a Schisme, and perturbe the peace of

<P><MILESTONE N="85"> For doubtlesse, you haue shewed your selfe heere a

which God hath gathered together by the trum|pet

spet in the face of your Mother, affirming, that our
Church was in an errour twentie yeeres, all the dayes
of <HI>Iohn Knoxe,</HI> for all that time it had no gouerne|ment,
but Episcopall: all that time, there was not such
a thing as a Presbyterie in the Church of Scotland:
and if any truth be in you, all that time was our Church
in errour? Beside this, you are blasphemous against
the Church present, and would make simple people
beleeue, that an errour is enforced vpon them, by the
King, by Preachers, by the generall assembly, wherein
you doe most wickedly, and falsly gaine-stand the
truth, since no such thing is done, but onely a gouerne|ment
restored, which the Primitiue Church had,
which Orthodoxe Churches of all times haue had,
which our owne Church in her purest state had: here
is the point: here is all the errour, and for out-holding
of this, you professe a Schisme and diuision betweene
a King, and Church, betweene Pastors and Pastors.</P>
<P>M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI> is not Ierusalem besieged without by
Romanes? Are not here both King and people in like

the rest, for the supereminence of his place? Is
there any Israelite vvithin: either Pastor or people,
whose blood is not sought by the enemie? Is it time

Authoritie, which is able to procure greatest

where-through, many of their chiefe Captaines are

<P>MY reason is better, then you consider: If we had <MILESTONE N="99">
liued among the Christians of the Church pri|mitiue,
sore persecuted three hundreth yeeres for Reli|gion
by Emperours who should haue protected them:
or if we had liued in the Church of Fraunce, our necks

<PB N="94" REF="58">
pleased God to turne the heart of the Emperour, and
King, not onely to protect vs, but to professe the Go|spell
with vs; we would haue been loath to haue dis|corded
with them for such a matter. You ponder not
this benefit, but waxe insolent, and thinke it nothing
to entertaine a diuision betweene a Church, and a
Christian King, for a matter, without which, true faith
in Christ, in all the articles thereof may be retained. In
my iudgement, the Church of France, or antient Chur|ches
sore bitten with affliction, would neuer haue dis|corded
vvith their Christian Rulers in such a cause.
You alleadge you haue a declaration of their minde in

to this cauilling, know you not that his Maiestie will

you speake as if the King were of your minde;
or at least would make the simple beleeue so, or that I
had ouer-seene my selfe so farre, as to say, that wee had

to make vs beleeue, that his Maiestie is on your side of

that vpon condition they had a Christian King, pro|fessing
the Gospell with them, they would be loath to

<P>YOur third argument is taken from an admonition <MILESTONE N="112">
as you call it, but a supplication, as I take it, sub|scribed
by mee: for answere to this, I will very plaine|ly
and truely declare the matter as it is, that men may
see there is no pith in your allegation to proue that
which you intend. That there was a supplication giuen
in I heare, who penned it, or what was in it I know
not, where they assembled whether in the Church, or
in a priuate house I enquire not, present at that mee|ting
sure it is I was not. It was brought to mee by a fa|miliar
brother, to mine owne house; I cannot remem|ber
whether before Sermon, or when I had new
come from it: but well I wot at such a time wherein
I had no leasure to reade it, like as I neuer read it: they
tolde mee it contained nothing but a supplication for
continuance of Church-gouernment, that then was.
And as I haue said, at that time I could willingly haue
contented; yea, contended for it as I might, that our
gouernment might continue, fearing euer least the in|tended
course had beene to abolish it; but from the time
I perceiued that the course was not to disanull any
substantiall point of Discipline which we had, but one|ly
to roberate it, by restoring againe Episcopall power,
whereby I perceiued the Church not weakened but
strengthened, not preiudiced but confirmed in all her
lawfull libertie, I reproued my selfe of my former folly,
and not onely consented vnto it, but the more I loo|ked
into it, the more I loued it, reioycing at the pre|ferment
of Preachers for this end, and in honouring
of them esteemed my selfe honoured. And if the sub|scribed
Supplication hath that in it which you affirme,
<PB N="108" REF="65">
that the office of a Bishop is slanderous in the Church,
which I can hardly thinke that any learned or well
adu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sed Preacher will affirme, then I make it knowne
vnto you it neyther had nor hath any approbation of
mine. This being the simple truth I doubt not but the

this fault, why blame you the town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> for it?</P>
<P>Tell mee, I pray you, was the Church of Ephesus
defaced, because some false Apostles did creepe into it?
find you not the contrarie? that the Bishop of Ephesus,
<PB N="121" REF="71">
called there the Angell, is commended, for that he had
examined them, and found them to be lyars. If the
Church of Edenburgh had fallen away (which GOD
auert) as the Church of <HI>Thyatyra</HI> did, and suffered <HI>Ieza|bell</HI>
a false Prophetesse to teach and deceiue the Ser|uants
of God; there then you might say it were a defa|ced
Church, I suppose (which I hope in God shall ne|uer
fall out) that Sathan had a Throne there, as he had
in Pergamus, yet seeing there is a Church that will not
denie the faith, no though <HI>Antipas</HI> should be slaine,
how say you the face of the Church is defaced? But the
contrarie is manifest, Satan may creepe in there like a
thiefe (thanks be to God) he hath no throne there: what
villanie can hee worke, which they punish not? Can
you say any of their Magistrates, Councellors, Mini|sters,
Elders, Deacons, or any honourable man of the
body of their Citie, is stained with that Heresie? How
then is the face of their Church defaced? And truely,
though that many such were among them (as you haue
said) which yet is not, it were no maruell to mee, when
I remember the Apostles saying; <HI>There must be Heresies,
that such as are approued may be tryed?</HI> Where there is
no winde to carrie chaffe away, how shall the Corne
be discerned? where there is no Heresie how shall they
be knowne who are confirmed in veritie, rooted and
grounded so in Christ, stablished and built vpon the
rocke, that no winde of contrarie doctrine can carrie
them away? Traduce as you will, this is the truth, for
many reasons is that Church worthy to be commen|ded;
but in my iudgement, this is the greatest com|mendation
that euer it got, that subtle Heretiques with
the seed of false doctrine, creeping in into her bosome,
to seeke an aduantage, can finde either none at all or
verie little. Yet your other Assertions are more impu|dent:

to remit it to further reasoning? In the one you haue
shewed superfluitie of malice, mouing you to speake

haue no reason to iustifie you in the condemning of it.
Thus haue you shewed your selfe, <HI>in initio confident em, in

bragge. You will not simplie giue ouer the combat,
but declines it farely for this time, and puts it off to a

worldly Hierarchie.</HI> M^r. <HI>Dauid</HI> leauing out the <HI>differences

which, in it selfe, signifies an authoritie or im|peratiue

differences, <HI>Papall, worldly, wicked:</HI> but M^r. <HI>Dauid</HI> to
declare how hee distrusts his owne cause, deceiueth
the simple, by putting in into his Reason the Word
<HI>Hierarchie</HI> onely. By this, any indifferent Reader may
see that M^r. <HI>Dauid</HI> deales not truely, nor faithfully, nor

<P>His second Reason is without reason, and against

Your other Obiection is, Superintendents had their <MILESTONE N="138">
Office from the Church: did their Office by aduise of
their Brethren, and were countable to the Church

Their Office and power is from the Church, their tem|porall
preferment, their rent and maintenance, is con|ferred
by the King; yea, good reason it is that his Ma|iestie
haue the nomination of a Bishop, out of lytes of
honest men giuen in by the Church: What nouation is
here? You will finde the nomination of Superinten|dents
referred to his Highnes Counsell in his Maiesties
minoritie, becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> they gaue them their maintenance,
see Act of Assemblie, <HI>An.</HI> 1562. Againe, Superinten|dents
did by aduise; good reason: see the Law prescri|bed

any Minister, without adu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">se of three well quali|fied
Ministers of the bounds. The same stands now,
and can you say that any Bishop in our Church stands
against this, except onely that where the Law bindes
them to vse the aduise of three, they vse the aduise of
sixe, or tenne, or thirteene if they may get them? What
can you say against this M^r. <HI>Dauid?</HI> See you not here
a constant forme of gouernment in our Church? See
you any other Bishops now then were in the dayes of
<HI>Iohn Knox?</HI> Here say you, Superintendents were
changeable? but you should haue cleared your selfe,
not deceiued the simple people vnder ambiguitie of
words. Tell the truth, were any of them changed in
their time, or was there any cause might haue taken
from them the office of a Superintendent, but such as
might haue also depriued of the Office of Preaching
and all other offices in the Church? In which case Su|perintendents,
Bishops, and Pastors, both might and
should lawfully be deposed; but God be praised such
examples feil not out in our Church.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="77">
Oh but Superintendents were subiect to their Bre|thren.
Here also you lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ke vnder the shadow of doubt|full
speeches. Will you say that Superintendents were
subiect to the censure of Ministers, ouer whom they
had the inspection? The contrarie is true, our Fathers
foresaw the perill of that, and exempted them from it;
reseruing them to be iudged by the generall Assemblie,
as I haue cleared before: and doubtlesse there could
be no order where such as should correct the faults of
others, are put vnder the censure of thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> that should
be corrected by them.</P>
<P>You still reply, there is now (say you) no generall
Assemblie to censure them: but you may know that the
same Law which restoreth the Iurisdiction of Bishops,
ratifieth also generall Assemblies, howbeit in a refor|med
State, the power to call it belongs to the Chri|stian
Magistrate, and seeing it is the Parliament of the
Church, the great Ecclesiastique Councell of the
Church, the calling of it, except vpon very vrgent oc|casions,
proueth often more hurtfull then helpfull, but
where great and weightie causes require it, you may be
sure the Prince will not refuse it.</P>
<P>But your great grudge is here, that Bishops are not
vnder the power of Ministers to be cast out of their
places by pluralitie of voices You dreame of an assem|blie
that would finde the authoritie vnlawfull, and de|pose
them all: but you are deceiued; our Ministrie are
not so affected, they see the necessitie and vtilitie of
this calling: they who disliked it at the first, are now
brought by reason and experience to allow it, and
where you will finde one discontented with it, I war|rant
you twe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tie who are pleased with it, and thanke
Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> for it.</P>
<P>Speake no more then of the exemption of Bishops
from censure, there is a Christian King, there is a Coun|cell
<PB N="133" REF="77">
of Bishops, till necessitie require a Nationall As|sembly,
and it is not denyed to any in the Church or
Kingdome to complaine, accuse, delate, Bishop or
Archbishop, that hee may be brought to his answere,
and tryed; yea some that haue complained, haue beene
answered with Iustice, to their satisfaction.</P>
<P>In a word, let it be told you in name of all the Bi|shops
of our Church, our Calling is of God, allowed
by the generall Assemblie, ratified by our most Chri|stian
King and States of the Kingdome. Our care is to
discharge it in the best sort wee can, when wee haue
done all that is possible for vs, there are many of you
ready so farre as you may to vndoe it, out of an euill
humor, more narrowly looking to negligences then to
obserue paines and good diligence: wee are men, and
may fall as others, but our faults should not be abused
to condemne our function, more then the faults of
Ministers condemne their Ministrie. We claime no li|berty,
but are readie by Gods grace, to answere all our
Superiours, and be censured by them as the meanest
in the Church. And we carrie this humble minde, that
if you, or any other, in loue and good affection, will
signifie to vs wherein wee offend, wee will either satis|fie
you by reason, or willingly amend it: yet so that
wee will maintaine the honour of our charge and cal|ling,
and not leaue it free for euery man to raile against

Episcopall gouernement: the strength of your cause
is in it, but it shall be knowne to be as weake as the
rest of your defences.</P>
<P>For first of all, an Oath should be defended by the <MILESTONE N="144">
lawfulnesse of the thing that is sworne, and it is no
good ground in Diuinitie, to defend the thing that is
sworne by pretence of the sacred authoritie of an Oath.
This order you keepe not.</P>
<P>Secondly, since the most part of Preachers in our <MILESTONE N="145">

there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> many others in the same estate: What reason
is it, that the Oath of some, albeit they had made it (as
you say) which will not be found, should binde others
that made it not.</P>
<P>Thirdly, when it was appointed by act of Parlia|ment,<MILESTONE N="146">
<HI>An. 1572. Ianuar.</HI> 26. that the confession of faith
which therein at length is exprest, should be sworne
and subscribed by all Church-men, the gouernement
which then was in our Church was Episcopall, for
the Oath and subscription is ordained to be made in
presence of the Archbishop, Superintendent, or Com|missioner
of the Diocie, as the words of the Act plainly
imports, so that this Oath makes no renunciation of
Episcopall authoritie, but rather ratefies and ap|proues
it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, concerning the latter Negatiue confessi|on,<MILESTONE N="147">
whereof it is most likely you meane, what will you
finde there against Episcopall gouernement? Nothing
at all: it is a good confession, many Pastors, profes|sours

or if you know better, what malice is this to

them in sinceritie, the perpetuall encrease of the holy Spi|rit.</HI>
See it registred in our assembly Bookes, <HI>An.</HI> 1566.
M. <HI>Dauid,</HI> did our Fathers esteeme Episcopall gouern|ment
<HI>Antichristian Hierarchie?</HI> Do they not plainely dis|ioyne
them, writing to Bishops that had renounced the
<HI>Romish Antichrist?</HI> O, but it will be said, Our Church
was then in her infancie; it may be you make them
all Infants: all the worthie, learned, and vnspotted
Superintendents of our Church, <HI>Iohn Willok</HI> Superin|tendent

where a man of your experience comes out: but be|leeue
me, wee haue not seene many such olde men in

<P>Now as this sense, which you make of the word <HI>Hie|rarchie,</HI><MILESTONE N="149">
is against the minde of our first Fathers; so is
it against the minde of the swearers and subscribers:
and are you not a foule abuser to inforce vpon them
a sense whereof they thought neuer? This is cleere as
the light. For why, did not his Maiestie sweare and
subscribe that confession of Faith? This was his royall
and most Christian oath, offered to God in defence of
his truth. Did not his Highnesse there, and at many
other times, professe openly a renunciation of that
wicked <HI>Hierarchie?</HI> Will you inferre vpon this, that his
Maiestie therefore abiured Episcopall gouernement?
I dare appeale to your owne knowledge, hath not his
Maiestie kept one constant iudgement concerning
Church-gouernement euer from his young yeeres?
doth not the inhibition of nouation in Church-go|uernement
cleere this? doth not the publike printed
<PB N="140" REF="81">
Declaration of his Highnesse intention proue it? doth
not all his Highnesse speeches, and actions, before the
subscription, since the subscription, declare his High|nesse
approbation of Episcopal gouernement? and yet
you would make it to be beleeued of the people, that
his Highnesse renounced Episcopall gouernement,
when his Maiestie renounced <HI>Hierarchie, vsurped, Pa|pall,
wicked:</HI> this, or else a worse, must be the drift of
your language. Truly you may thanke God you haue
to doe with a clement and gratious king. And that
this same which is his Highnesse mind of that Article,
is also the minde of most part of the ancient teachers,
and other brethren, learned, godly, vnspotted, who
haue well deserued of the Church present, by fidelitie
in their ministrie, will bee cleared also: I will not goe
about in any inordinate manner to seeke subscriptions
to this purpose, but when it shall be required by order
in the Church, you will finde a cloud of witnesses
standing against you, to improue this calumnie of
yours: yea, many times in my younger yeeres haue I
heard famous and auncient Fathers of our Church,
who haue seene the first beginnings thereof, affirme,
that our Church could not consist vnlesse Episcopall
gouernement were restored againe: this they spake
when there was no appearance of it, and when Episco|pall
gouernement was in greatest disdaine, and at that
time being vnacquainted with Church discipline, I
thought strange to heare it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="150"> And here againe, M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI> I am in doubt with
my selfe, what to thinke of you, seeing I know no o|ther

I thinke ignorance hath done it? You are giuen out,
and bragged of for a learned man, and a Writer. Or
shall I thinke malice hath done it? you are counted for
a Christian, and so I thinke you be: what euer hath
moued you, sure I am, it hath miscarryed you: for let
mee tell you, when <HI>Zorimus</HI> Bishop of Rome, sent ouer
his Legates to the councell of Africke, wherein were
assembled two hundred &amp; seauenteene Bishops, among
whom it is thought <HI>Augustine</HI> was one, to proue that
it was lawfull to appeale vnto him from all Bishops in
the world, alleadging this power was giuen by the
Councell of Nice: after long deliberation and inqui|sition
of the most auncient Copies of the Councell of
Nice, his fraudulent vsurpation was discouered, and he
warmed by these Fathers neuer to attempt any such
thing in time to come. Many reasons they gaue him (as
indeede they had all reason for it) specially this, that
the grace of the holy Ghost, had not with-drawne it
selfe from all other Prouinces to rest in one alone,
to discerne there the right of all causes: wherefore they
willed him to abstaine from such ambition, <HI>Ne fum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|sum

M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI> you see a solemne reiection of the <HI>wicked
Hierarchie</HI> of the Bishop of Rome: Did these Fathers
by so doing reiect Episcopall authoritie exercised by
themselues allowed, accepted, embraced, and reueren|ced
in their Churches. Thus haue I made cleare that
you haue fained a sense of that article contrarie to his
Maiesties minde, contrarie to the minde of the first Fa|thers
of our Church, contrary to the minde of the pre|sent
Fathers of our Church, and contrary to the mind
of the ancient Fathers of the Church primitiue in the
foure hundreth yeere.</P>
<P>And if I should draw you vp higher, are you able to <MILESTONE N="151">
denie that Episcopall gouernment was in the Church
<PB N="142" REF="82">
before that Romish Hierarchie was hatched out of the
the shell? What hath the one of them to do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the
other? Hath the Romish Church beene more impug|ned
by any then Orthodoxe Bishops? Or hath any
sort of men beene more persecuted by the Romish Hie|rarchie,
then reformed Bishops? Why are you so vn|righteous
as to oppresse the one vnder the name of the
other? Were all the Bishops who suffered Martyrdome
in the first three hundred yeeres, guiltie of that Hierar|chie
which you haue condemned? And if I should
draw you yet vp higher, I see as much light in the word
of God, as giues warrant to me of the lawfulnesse of
Episcopall Gouernment, and I doubt not will serue to
content reasonable men when they shall heare it. You
prouoked me to this point; but you turne your backe
and flie from it, and I haue not any leasure to pursue a

<P><MILESTONE N="152"> These things therefore so standing, the Question
will be thus: Seeing Episcopall gouernment in it selfe
is lawfull, seeing all Christian Churches haue had it,
seeing our owne Church had it ratified by acts of ge|nerall
Assemblie, for many yeeres, with an happie suc|cesse
of the Euangell; seeing it was laid by against the
will of a Christian King in his minoritie, against the
will of his Highnesse Regent, and Lords of Councell,
well affected to Religion, and that not simplie, but with
a power of reuocation: <HI>queritur,</HI> whether if or not, a
Christian King in his maioritie, requiring a restitution
of it, the present Church hath done well to receiue it
in againe; especially, seeing it is done without destru|ction
of that policie so long aduised, and added at
length by the Fathers of the middle age of our
<PB N="143" REF="82">
Church, for strengthening of our Discipline.</P>
<P>To contract then all the matter which you haue <MILESTONE N="153">
spread out with a multitude of idle words, into a short
summe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> <HI>There is no new Discipline brought into the Church,
but the auncient restored to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> former strength, no point of
later policie abolished, but established, and an happy vnion
made euery way betweene them who should agree in one, to
do the worke of God.</HI> This is my iudgement, and I esteeme
by it the name of the Church of Scotland honoured, a
Christian King in his most reasonable desire satisfied,
the peace of the Church happily procured, the mouths
of aduersaries stopped, offence from weake and simple
ones remoued, and much more good easily effected, if
contentious and vaine spirits would not hinder it.</P>
<P>Thus is the very state of the question cleared vnto <MILESTONE N="154">
you, so that you haue no cause to cry out as you doe,
<HI>Who should teach vs but Bishops? and if they will not, our
bloud be vpon their heads.</HI> You seeme to be very earnest
here, but all men may see it is but your Orpit or Ironic
conceit: so like as M. <HI>Dauid</HI> will be taught of Bishops,
a sort of profane men without either learning or grace,
in your account. But you neede not make the halfe of
this stirre; you might be ignorant of Church-gouerne|ment,
and your bloud in no danger for all that: but if
indeede you stand in feare least you loose your soule,
follow our counsell, and we shall lay our life for yours,
Repent of your sinnes, Beleeue in Iesus the Sauiour of
the world, Amend your life, <HI>Decke the hid man of your

be guiltie of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="155"> The rest of your discourses of paritie and imparitie
in Church-gouernement, are answered by that which
I haue said; neither doe you here your selfe insist in
them, but remit mee by particular quotations to your
Epistles, foureteene in number, written to seuerall men,
contayning eight sheetes of paper, bound vp in forme
of a Booke, and sent to mee to peruse them. But you
must remember it is an vnreasonable request to require
a Bishop, employed in daily teaching, and other neces|sarie
charges in the Church, to reade ouer all your
missiue Letters, yet haue I looked to them as I had lea|sure,
and answered them as cause requires in this my
Defence. As for your Epistles, if your conceit be such
of them, as if they contained humane and diuine lear|ning,
like that which <HI>Augustine</HI> hath vttered in his two
and twentie Bookes <HI>de Ciuitate Dei:</HI> or if for Eloquence
you esteeme them like the workes of some new <HI>Cicero;</HI>
or else for vndoubted Rules of Church-gouernement
that are in them, you meane to make them vp as the
bodie of some new Canon Law, whereunto in reason|ing
you will remit men as vnto Rules and Decrees; or
at least, will haue other men take paines to make glosses
and Notes vpon them: then I pray you M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI>
seeke some <HI>Aldus Manutius,</HI> or <HI>Ludouicus Viues,</HI> or some
new <HI>Gratianus,</HI> you will get of these right good on that
side of the water: but M^r. <HI>Dauid,</HI> for me, I thinke them
not worthie of that paynes, neyther haue I any time to
spare vpon them; the paines I haue taken are for your
satisfaction if reason may doe it; to pleasure you I haue
lost much good time, which I intended to bestow an|other
way. At the midst of <HI>September</HI> I receiued your
<HI>Admonitorie,</HI> as your Letter will shew, though many
<PB N="145" REF="83">
saw it before you sent it to mee. In the end of <HI>October</HI>
I absolued this answere to it; what time hath ouerpast
since, hath beene spent in writing it ouer and ouer a|gaine
for the Presse, for you will haue it publicke, and
it is best so, for others and me also, to ease me of much
paines of priuate writing, wherein I cannot giue euery
man contentment. If my paines profit not you, I haue
great losse, beside my instant labour, being forced, all
this time to intermit mine ordinarie exercise of teach|ing
at Euening Prayer: wherein I know you haue
done more euill to this people, then I thinke you haue
done good to any Congregation in the Land: but if
eyther my paines or their losse (for this time) may serue
to gaine you, the one I will thinke pleasure, the other
I thinke they will esteeme vantage; if not, yet I hope it
shall doe good vnto others.</P>
<P>And now in the end, albeit M. <HI>Dauid</HI> doe shunne the
Question it selfe, yet seeing hee desireth I should com|municate
to him such light as I haue, I will not refuse
to doe it, partly for his satisfaction, and partly also for
satisfaction of others, who are not contentious of pur|pose
about this question.</P>
<P>There are some godly and learned men in the
Church, who maintaine Episcopall gouernment to be
<HI>iuris diuini,</HI> of diuine authoritie: there are others, wor|thy
Light of the Church also, who albeit they thinke
it not to be <HI>iuris diuini,</HI> but <HI>humani</HI> or <HI>Ecclesiastici,</HI> and
sees not that it is a diuine ordinance, but humane, or
Ecclesiastique, yet they reuerence it as a good, and a
lawfull, and a profitable policie for the Church.</P>
<P>If M^r. <HI>Dauid</HI> will not adioyne himselfe to the first, I
wish at least, hee would betake himselfe to the modest
iudgement of the second; and consider what a grieuous
sinne it is to nourish a Schisme in the Church, for such
a matter, and how far the famous Lights of our time
<PB N="146" REF="84">
mislike them who spare not to diuide the Church, for
their opinion in the contrary.</P>
<P>The Arguments vsed by the first sort, the Reader
will finde at length in the learned Treatises of D. <HI>Whyt|gift,
Bilson, Douname:</HI> The reasons mouing mee to in|cline
to Episcopall gouernment, and by which I found
greatest light and contentment to mine owne minde,

Epist. ad Ephes. cap.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>Againe, it is obiected that Christ hath forbidden that
any should be called Lords or Masters vpon earth. I
answere that the same Lord hath also forbidden that
any should be called Father vpon earth: Wherefore
the interdiction is not to be vnderstood of the appella|tion
of any by such names, but of some other thing.
Againe, the circumstance of the place proues plainely
what is the meaning thereof: for, hee addes; <HI>He that is
greatest among you, let him be the seruant of the rest:</HI> he will
not therefore take away the stile of Master, Father, or
Doctor, but onely the arrogant conceit of any great|nesse
in themselues for it.</P>
<P>And in another place to this same purpose saith <HI>Zan|chius:
Cum prius omnes verbi Ministri, tum Pastores tum</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="91">

Presbyteri, hoc minime improbari posse iudicamus.</P>
<P>Whereas before all Preachers of the word were cal|led
equally, Pastors, Bishops, Presbyters, and were al|so
of equall authoritie, that thereafter one was set ouer
the rest, albeit not as a Lord, but as a Gouernour of
an Academie, and that to him was committed the
charge of the whole Church, who for that, in a more
excellent and singular manner was called Bishop, the
rest of the Preachers contenting themselues with the
name of Presbyters; so that in euery Citie, there vvas
but one Bishop and many Presbyters or Ministers. This
is a policie which in my iudgement cannot be dis|allowed.</P>
<P>Hac saue ratione quae etiam de Archiepiscopis, imo &amp; de

<P>And by this same reason also, that which is said of
Archbishops; yea, and of the foure Patriarkes created
before the Counsell of Nice, wee thinke may be not
onely excused, but easily defended. And least (as com|monly
is obiected) men should thinke that this distin|ction
of degrees tends to establish also the Superioritie
of one aboue the whole Church: Marke what this same
Father hath in the Chapter following.</P>
<P><HI>Ceterum quod vnus tantum caput omnibus per vniuersum

But that one as head should be set ouer all the Chur|ches

we cannot approue, but also cannot but curse.</P>
<P>Whereof it is euident, that if the iudgement of <HI>Zan|chius</HI>
be any thing worth, it must be eyther a grosse ig|norance,
or great malice, that stirreth vp many to cry
out against Episcopall gouernment, as if it were An|tichristian.
It is to be wished that wee had many such
wise, humble, learned, and sober minded men among
vs: for the cause of our trouble is the ignorance of
some, the pride of others, (a very few excepted,) and
these are the Parents of needlesse contention.</P>
<P><HI>And yet more cleare is that other part of</HI> Zanchius
<HI>his testimonie cited by vs before, which now followes,</HI>

<P>Who am I that I should disallow that which the
whole Church hath allowed; yea, neyther dare all the
Doctors of this time disallow it, knowing that this
<PB N="162" REF="92">
policie is lawfull in the Church, and that for good
ends; namely, the edification of the Elect, it was re|ceiued
and ordained. It behoued mee also to haue re|spect
vnto those Churches which haue imbraced the
Gospell with Bishops both in name and office. Yea, al|so
in the Churches of Protestants, there wants not in
effect Bishops and Archbishops, whom (by changing
good Greeke names into euill Latine names) they call
Superintendents, and generall Superintendents. And
euen there where neyther the good auncient Greeke
names (of Bishop and Archbishop) nor the euill Latine
names (of Superintendents) haue place, yet is there
some principall men who haue the authoritie and
chiefe credit of Church-gouernment. So that the Con|trouersie
is onely about names, but where men agree
in the matter, why should there be an vnnecessarie
strife about words?</P>

<P>This is the iudgement of these modest and reuerent

they reuerence it as a necessarie and lawfull policie,
which may make most iustly the malecontents of our

that the office of a Bishop is Antichristian, that the

much the more confirmes me, that I see you fight with
lies and vntruths.</P>
<P>You denie that Superintendents and Bishops are
one, <HI>Fol.</HI> 6. And why? Because Superintendents rode
not at Parliament. A strong argument (forsooth) as
if this pertained to the substance of their Office: but it
is good enough, you wot where.</P>
<P>Your&punc; anger at Episcopall garments, and their ri|ding
at Parliament with Foot-cloathes, would be the
lesse, if your care to redresse vanitie of apparrell in
your selfe, and your complices were greater. As for
Bishops their apparrell and riding, where-vpon you
<PB N="174" REF="98">
gnaw so much, if the honour of their place in that su|preame
Court of this Kingdome, wherein now they
haue by his Highnesse fauour that benefit to sit, cra|ued
so long by our Fathers, and not obtained till now,
if this I say moued them no more, then any respect of
honour to themselues, I doubt not they could wil|lingly

you in this as I could, well I know I might iust|ly
make you asharned.</P>
<P>Bishops you graunt, <HI>Fol.</HI> 6. were once set vp in our
Church, with consent of our Church: so your first
brother confessed before you; what aileth you then at
a Bishop now? why make you such a stirre for recei|uing
that, which our best and oldest Fathers embra|ced
before vs. Why call you hereafter Episcopall go|uernment,
<HI>The Romish Hierarchie? Fol.</HI> 10. Did M^r. <HI>Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">x</HI>
and our Fathers set vp Romish Hierarchie? this must
follow, if you be a true man. God forgiue you, and
lay it not to your charge, that rends the Vnitie of our
Church for that which you are forced to graunt our
Fathers had before vs: you blame them who haue
departed from you: but considers not they haue ioy|ned
themselues to the Fathers of our Church older
then you, the blame is not theirs, but shall be yours, if
you also follow them not: for my owne part it repents
me, I knew not the truth of this matter sooner, but as
now by searching the monuments of our Church and
former Churches I know it. If I had knowne it, no
man should haue beene confirmed by my example in
the contrarie. There may be personall faults in Bi|shops
present, they are but men: but I am sure the in|solent
pride euident in many of you, that will follow
none, but be followed of others; together with your
hote contentions and needlesse strife, whereby you
rend the bowels of this Church without compassion,
<PB N="175" REF="98">
bending your tongues in publicke and priuate against
your brethren: is a sinne more abhominable in Gods
sight, then any wherewith you are able to charge
them? Let alone therefore this conceit, and standing
vpon your reputation. Thinke it no shame to submit
your selfe to Episcopall gouernement; to receiue it in
the Church, which the plaine euidence of truth forces
your selfe to confesse, that it was set vp in our Church
by the oldest and best Fathers that euer our Church
had. But if still you will be contentious, and foster a
diuision, if you will depriue this poore Church of the
good wee might haue vnder so Christian a King, so
long as wee haue his Highnesse for the establishing of
the Gospell: if you haue no respect to encrease his
Highnesse ioy be our Vnion, nor to vnite the pre|sent
estate of our Church with her first estate for the
honour thereof? If you haue no care to stoppe the
mouth of the common aduersarie, and will diuide Ie|rusalem
within, when it is besieged without, stand in
feare, least God require this at your hands. You de|nie
that the Episcopall and Presbyteriall gouernement
were euer vnited. You may as well denie, that the
Sunne shined in the Primitiue Church. Your fellow
Writer wishes he had the benefit of Printing, I wish the
same; you care not what you write in priuate, but if
you were to publish them by Print, I hope it should be
some awband to you, to restraine you from your ac|customed
rash affirmations of such Paradoxes, vn|truthes,
fables: or otherwise it would turne to your
greater shame. But now if you will credit <HI>Ignatius,</HI> from
<HI>Peter</HI> the third Bishop of Antiochia: through all his
Epistles, hee euer distinguishes a Bishop and a Presby|terie,
and yet makes them sweetly concurre to doe the
worke of God: let it be, you doubt of some of his Epi|stles,
but I hope you will not reiect them all: hauing

<PB N="178" REF="100">
onely affirmes that the power of a Bishop ouer Pres|byters

also by diuine authoritie.</P>
<P>I could to this same purpose bring many others, if
at this time I might attaine to my owne minutes, col|lected
for helpe of my memorie. But let these suffice
for the present. If they content you not, then I send
you to the fourth Booke of <HI>Douname,</HI> wherein hee
proueth Episcopall Function to be of Apostolicall in|stitution,
because it was generally receiued in the first
three hundred yeeres after the Apostles. If you be
purposed to dispute this question, you will finde him
there with very formall and forcible reasonings defen|ding
Episcopall gouernement: if you will not, as I
thinke you will not meddle with him, because hee is
too strong for you, then you shall doe best to let alone
your whisperings in the eares of simple people, and
your triuiall arguments which seeme good enough to
them that know no better, but in very deede are like
the Cuties of bone wherewith Children shoote in the
streetes, that may well make a little fize with powder,
but are not able to carrie any Bullet, and it will be long
before you hurt a Bishop with such.</P>
<P>You carp at my Argument <HI>fol.</HI> 9. that I bring to
proue the externall D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">scipline to be arbitarie and
changeable, as may best serue for edification, because
the Apostles, in a greater matter, dispensed with Cir|cumcision
for edification, some of them retayning it,
some not admitting it, as they saw best for the state of
their people. You neede not tell mee that Circumci|sion
was a Sacrament, and no point of Church-go|uernment,
I know that very vvell: but must tell you
againe, that as quicke as you thinke your selfe, you
mistake the argument; for, it is from the more to the
lesse: If the Apostles vsed a diuersitie in a greater thing,
<PB N="179" REF="100">
for the good of the Church, and did not all keepe one
rule concerning the Sacrament of Circumcision;
why shall it be thought euill now to see diuersitie in
the Church about a lesse thing? some Churches vsing
externall gouernment one way, others another way, as
the state of the time and people requires. Besides that,
I beleeued your Doctorship had beene so acquainted,
at least with the recent Writers of this age, that you
would haue soone perceiued the Author of the words
alledged by mee to be <HI>Musculus</HI> on 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. and his
probation of it, is not from auncient <HI>Augustine,</HI> as
you take it, but from the latter <HI>Augustana Confessio;</HI> put
on your Spectacles and reade it againe. Thus while as
like a blinde man you would strike at mee, you strike a
more worthy man then euer you were, and a vvhole
reformed Church also. Yet for all this, your vvords
are oracles good enough (I warrant you) in your owne
Conuenticles, and with them the simplicitie of many
Christians is abused, whose eyes I pray the Lord open,
that as they know the truth of the Gospell, so they may
know the truth of this question also, and leaue off to
rend this Church by so vnlawfull a diuision.</P>
<P>That you affirme no Schisme was in our Church
till Bishops came. I must tell you this is but your ca|lumnie,
and the contrarie is notoriously knowne: to
mee it is cleare as the light; with a mourning heart ma|ny
a time haue I looked vnto one, I could make it
cleare to the world, but I will not for all your prouo|cation.
I say no more, but if you be ignorant of this,
you are a great stranger in S. <HI>Andrewes.</HI></P>
<P>Your Discourses <HI>fol.</HI> 10. 11. 12. 13. are answered al|readie.
In the 14 you condemne the calling of the Bi|shops
of this Church, they neyther haue it from the
people, nor the Church, nor the generall Assemblie.
Surely, you are a pert affirmer of any thing you please,
<PB N="180" REF="101">
for you will not finde any Bishop of Scotland, whom
the generall Assemblie hath not first nominated and
giuen vp in lytes to that effect, or else by such as haue
authoritie in the Church to doe it.</P>
<P>In your <HI>fol.</HI> 15. you vsurpe the iudgement of my con|science,
and therein vtters the pride of your spirit, but
impaires not mine honest inward testimonie in the
contrarie. I affected no Bishoprie, no creature can con|uince
me of <HI>Ambitus,</HI> directly nor indirectly: but you
must be like your selfe, affirme falshoods confidently,
that your simple ones may beleeue you: neuerthelesse
know that God will bring you to iudgement, and you
shall be countable, if for your idle words, much more
for your false lying words, spoken and published for
the corrupting of others.</P>
<P>My words against the lying Libeller you wickedly
and most wrongfully wrest against my brethren, God
forgiue you; I haue answered it alreadie.</P>
<P>And where in your last leafe you runne out vpon
your comparisons, that those who haue laboured more
faithfully and fruitfully in the worke of GOD then I
haue done, could teach mee how to behaue my selfe
in the house of God, though now (say you) I seeme
to my selfe a great Doctor in Israell. All this is but
needlesse talke: I refuse not to be taught of any in the
Church, I haue learned some good from any that
euer I heard, and haue taken paines to keepe it: but
what I seeme to be in mine owne eies is hard for you to
know. When in the secret of my heart I deale vvith
my God, I know my roome, that I am the chiefe of
sinners, and least of Saints; and in truth I so esteeme
my selfe: but where you will come in, and out of your
pride, runne ouer mee, and treade my gift vnder
your feete, I will not suffer you. It is not mine owne,
and I got it not from you I will speake in defence of it,
<PB N="181" REF="101">
and not let you disgrace it. I haue by the grace of God,
laboured as faithfully, diligently, and I trust also fruit|fully,
as you, or any with you that haue stretched the
penne against mee. Hee that made mee a Doctor in
Israell, hath taught mee that which I neuer learned
from man, and wherewith you, if you were well tryed
would be found vnacquainted.</P>
<P>Some of your sort, I wot not if it be your selfe, haue
beene carping at my works in a publicke Sermon to
the people. S. <HI>Luke</HI> (saith hee) when hee wrote the
Historie of the <HI>Acts,</HI> dedicates it simplie to <HI>Theophilus,</HI>
but some Writers of our time must in their Dedicatorie
Epistles premit honourable Stiles: Is not this thinke
you, good Diuinitie? But the reputation of this Do|ctor
maketh any thing good enough that hee liketh
to speake. But if hee read the Booke through, before
hee beganne to expound it, hee might haue marked
that S. <HI>Paul</HI> speaking to <HI>Festus,</HI> giues him an honou|rable
Stile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 26. 25.</NOTE> <HI>O Noble Festus!</HI> What will hee say vvhen
hee comes to that place? If it had beene eyther He|resie,
or flatterie, or vnlawfull, in it selfe, to giue Stiles
of honour to honourable men, S. <HI>Paul</HI> would not haue
vsed it. And hee who did obserue this lesson on Saint
<HI>Lukes</HI> speech to <HI>Theophilus,</HI> did but abuse his hearers,
and wrong the absent whose workes hee would faine
disgrace, for a misliking of himselfe.</P>
<P>As for fideli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e in the Ministerie, the onely Iudge
thereof is the Lord: and who hath laboured more or
lesse fruitfully in his worke, will be knowne in that
day wherein euery mans fruit shall be manifested: your
presumpeuous preuenting of it will make no man vp
nor downe: hee is not higher, because you doe com|mend
him, nor the lower, because you disesteeme of
him. My labours published for edification of others,
are not the lesse regarded, that they want some <HI>Fifaean
<PB N="182" REF="102">
Sonnets</HI> prefixed to them, meeter for Actors of Come|dies
then Doctors of Diuinitie.</P>
<P>In your Conclusion, seeing you will haue no peace
except it agree with your humour, which I am not
able to giue, and is as little reason you should receiue,
I leaue you till God mend you, and worke a more
sober and peaceable minde in you: and so farewell.</P>
