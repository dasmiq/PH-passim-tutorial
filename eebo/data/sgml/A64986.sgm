<HEAD>To the Christian Reader; espe|cially
Heads of Families.</HEAD>
<P>THose Catechisms may very well
be esteemed the best, which are
Explanatory of the Creed, ten
Commandments and the Lords
Prayer; because these Summaries or Ab|stracts
contain the Essentials of the true Re|ligion,
or those choice truths which God
would have us take extraordinary notice of
in our course of reading the holy Scriptures:
And therefore those that begin with Cate|chizing,
begin the most easie and profitable
way for any; because the weightier matters
of the Law are not hard to be understood,
and such words being Spirit and Life, and
the very marrow of Christianity, must needs
feed and nourish us up unto eternal life. I
have fixed my thoughts upon the Assemblies
shorter Catechism, because the Principles
in it are mostly agreed upon by all sober intel|ligent
<PB REF="3">
unprejudiced Protestant Divines. You
have also something of the nature of the two
Covenants superadded to, or rather enlarged
upon more particularly and expresly than in
the Catechism. And because Catechisms ought
to contain nothing but received truths, you
have mostly the Explication of Antient and
Modern Divines: And therefore, where you
meet with any thing that is not so elaborate
and exact, you may conclude it mine, and
not theirs. Hearing occasionally a Discourse
of a very learned and godly Divine out of
<HI>Deut. 6. 6, 7. [And these words which I
command thee this day, shall be in thy
heart: And thou shalt teach them dili|gently
unto thy Children,</HI> &amp;c.] who re|commended
to Parents with the greatest ear|nestness
the work of Catechizing; I shall
make bold to transcribe a part of it, and
offer it to publick view. You shall have, 1. His
Reasons to prove that Parents ought diligent|ly
to Catechize or teach their Children [Ser|vants
also included.] 2. His Answers to
the Objections against it. And 3. The Mo|tives
he laid down to provoke and stir up all
Parents to this necessary duty.</P>
<P>10. Reasons for the proof of it.</P>
<P>1. Every man ought to promote the Glory
of God, to advance the Kingdom of Christ,
<PB REF="3">
and to further the Salvation of others as far
forth as they are able, and have opportunity
to it. And can we effect these any better
way? We pray, <HI>Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done:</HI>
Surely the coming of Christs Kingdom into
our hearts is one way of his Kingdom's
coming.</P>
<P>2. God hath set Parents in Authority
over them, and they cannot improve it to
better purpose. This is the most ancient Go|vernment.
Before there was King or Com|mon-wealth,
there was Parental Government.
This being most ancient, afterwards was the
Priest and Prophet. God hath laid a com|mand
upon Children to obedience in the fifth
Commandment, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6. 1. Only Dig|nity
requires duty; improve your authority
for God, and use it to instruct your House|hold
in the Word of God. Do not think
you have done, till you have done this.</P>
<P>3. Even nature it self dictates thus much.
The Birds and Beasts of the field, yea the
Sea-monsters take care of their young ones.
If you do nothing but feed and cloath your
Children, you do no more than Heathens, nay
than brute beasts. 'Tis said of the Ostrich,
<HI>Job</HI> 39. 16. that she is hardened against
her young ones, as though they were not hers:
<PB REF="4">
And what do ignorant Parents less, who are
hardened against their own Children who
are parts of themselves?</P>
<P>4. Children have Souls to be saved or
damned, therefore some must take care of them,
and the soul that sinneth must die. We see
Children die as well as Aged persons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 10</NOTE> In
Golgatha there are Skulls of all sorts: Yea,
do but look into the Register of a Parish, and
you shall see as many young as old have died
in it. Children may die, and what if they
die without knowledge, in their sins? better
were it with those Children mentioned,
2 <HI>Kings</HI> 2. 23, 24. than these, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27. 11.
2 Thes. 1. 7, 8. Thus unchastised Children
shall suffer; but the Parents shall not go
Scot-free. If you would have them profit
by the publick Ministry, you must Catechize
them at home. To bring them to the publick
before they be thus Catechized, is setting
before them an hard loaf. You must give
them milk at home, that they may be fit for
higher truths in publick.</P>
<P>5. Your Children are Children of wrath,
and you have been instruments to conveigh
this to them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 51. 1, 5</NOTE> They die, and that proves this.
When your Children are sick, you forthwith
go to the Physitian, and will you take no care of
their Souls, inheriting their spiritual mala|dies
<PB REF="4">
from you? You may say as <HI>David</HI> to
Abiathar, 1 Sam. 22. 22. I have occasion|ed
the death of all the persons of thy
Fathers house.</P>
<P>6. What will become of Religion in future
Ages, if Parents neglect this duty at present?
If all Parents were as careless as some, the
Church of God would soon cease on the earth,
<HI>Isa. 38. 19. The Father to the Children
shall make known thy truth,</HI> Psal. 78. 3, 4.
<HI>Which we have heard and known, and our
Fathers have told us; We will not hide
them from their Children, shewing to the
Generation to come the praises of the
Lord.</HI> If we do not teach our Children how
should they teach theirs? It was above two
thousand years before the Scripture was writ|ten;
how then was piety preserved but by one
Generation teaching another? <HI>Adam</HI> taught
his Children. The sacrificing of <HI>Cain,</HI> and
<HI>Abel</HI>'s piety therein were both the fruit of
<HI>Adam</HI>'s teaching. <HI>Noah</HI> taught his Children
to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and he taught his houshold.
<HI>Isa.</HI> 1. 9. Except the Lord of Hosts had left
unto us a very small Remnant, we should
have been as <HI>Sodom,</HI> and we should have
been like unto <HI>Gomorrah:</HI> We should have
been as Heathenish, as Paganish as they.</P>
<P>7. God is highly pleased with piety in younger
<PB REF="5">
ones. The Lord had respect to <HI>Abel</HI> the younger;
and <HI>Enoch</HI> of all the Patriarchs before the
Flood the youngest, is said to please God. How
was God pleased with the piety of <HI>Samuel</HI>
and <HI>Josiah?</HI> And we read of <HI>Jehojachin</HI> that
began very young to Reign; and did that
which was evil in the sight of the Lord,
2 <HI>Kings</HI> 24. 8, 9. God takes notice of the
evil as well as the good. Children might sing
<HI>Hosanna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 21. 15.</NOTE> as well as cry bold-head, if they
were taught. Iesus said, <HI>Mat. 19. 14.
Suffer little Children, and forbid them not
to come unto me: for of such is the King|dom
of Heaven.</HI> Of such, not untaught
Children.</P>
<P>8. You cannot expect the blessings of the
Covenant, except y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">u teach them the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m|mandments
of God <HI>Ps. 103. 17, 18. Dan.</HI> 9. 4.</P>
<P>9. Assure your selves, if you neglect this
duty, God will require their blood at your
hands, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9. 5. with <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 26. It is
here with Parents as with Ministers; if you
do not warn and teach them, God will re|quire
their blood at your hands. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3. 18.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But teaching is the work of the
Minister?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is not only his, but yours; his
in publick, yours in your Families.</P>
<P>10. Sin and corruption is so inherent in
<PB REF="5">
Children in their nature, that all the care of
Ministers in publick, and Parents at home
will be little enough to heal this plague of
original corruption.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Levit. 14. 41, &amp;c.</NOTE> This plague is like the
Leprosie. There must be scraping, and if
cleansing will not do, there must be pulling
down. So that you see all is little enough:
without teaching, your Children may perish,
and you smart for it.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. But Children may do well
that are not thus carefully instructed.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. They may do well as to the out|ward
man, they may prosper in the world.
God may cause his Sun to shine upon the un|just
and the unthankful. But Parents are
to wish that their Children may do well as to
the inward man, and prosper in their Souls,
as <HI>John</HI> for his friend <HI>Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us, 3 Joh.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>2. They may perish eternally for want of
Knowledge. <HI>Hos.</HI> 4. 6.</P>
<P>3. If some Children happen to come to good,
no thanks to such careless graceless Parents
that neglect instruction at home.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. But we have known them
that have been taught well enough to
have made bad proof?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. This is too sadly true, to be denied;
But the fault may be in one of the Parents
by their bad example: And Children as well
<PB REF="6">
as the conclusion in syllogizing will follow the
worse and weaker part; yet this is blame|worthy
in Parents.</P>
<P>2. Good Parents have severely smarted for
their neglect of strict Discipline in their Fa|milies,
and their over great fondness in cock|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ring
their Children, as you may read in <HI>Eli</HI>
and <HI>David. 1 Sam. 3. 13. 2 Sam</HI> 13, and
14, and 15. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 1. 6.</P>
<P>3. But if the Children of good Parents
prove bad, this should make us more diligent.
If a Garden well weeded and kept down prove
thus ill; Is this any encouragement to sloth,
but rather a spur to double diligence?</P>
<P>Two or three Motives to excite to the Du|ty
of Catechizing.</P>
<P>Let it be remembred that you are not per|swaded
to invade the ministerial office, or to
become of this or that Opinion or Party, but
to fall forthwith upon the practice of a mani|fest,
yet indispensable Duty.</P>
<P>1. How doth the love of God dwell in your
hearts, when they are hardened against your
Children? <HI>Simon, lovest thou me? then
feed my Lambs.</HI> They are Gods Children,
and therefore you must bring them up in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ture and admonition of the Lord. The
Children of any in Covenant with God are
called his Children, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 15. 21. When the
<PB REF="6">
woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> knew Christ, she desired
that all her Neighbours might also know him.</P>
<P>2. Are they not your Children? You shall
diligently teach them to your Children; they
are bone of your hone, and flesh of your flesh.
Are we to instruct one another, and not our
own Children?</P>
<P>3. What a comfort will this be to you, if
you faithfully discharge this most profitahle
Duty! For,</P>
<P>1. Such Parents shall have joy of their Chil|dren,
<HI>Prov. 23. 24. Ruth 4. 15. David</HI> and
<HI>Bath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sheba</HI> had much comfort of <HI>Solomon,</HI>
which they had not of their other Children.</P>
<P>2. You shall have spiritual rejoycing,
2 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>3. You will gain a good evidence of the
truth of grace in your hearts.</P>
<P>4. You that thus propagate piety shall
sow good seed that will endure to many Ge|nerations,
<HI>Jer.</HI> 33. 18.</P>
<P>5. You may avoid many crosses and heart-breaking
sorrows which negligent Parents
ordinarily meet with. <HI>Abraham</HI> taught his
Children, and see what comfort he had of
them: He had a numerous Family 318. in|structed
Servants born in his own house
[<HI>Gen.</HI> 14. 14.] and yet no disorder or distur|bance
there: He had a numerous Family, and
yet a peaceable Family.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">1. <HI>Abraham</HI> Circumciseth <HI>Ishmael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 17.</NOTE> and
yet it was a painful Sacrament.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Isaac</HI> makes no opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">siti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n when to be
made a sacrifice to the Will of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 22</NOTE></P>
<P>3. Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">u have a religious Servant. <HI>Gen.</HI>
15, and 24.</P>
<P>4. At his death he gives what portions he
pleaseth, and yet you find no discord among
them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 25. 5, 6. As you therefore desire
peace in your Families, and in after Genera|tions,
bring them up in the fear of the Lord.</P>
<P>On the contrary, you Parents that teach
your Children Arts and Trades, and not Gods
Commandments; why, you are making way
for your own cross and vexation; what heart|breaking
will they be to you! As,</P>
<P>1. In their matching. <HI>Prov. 17. 21, 25.
G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n.</HI> 26. 34. 35.</P>
<P>2. Their sins will be put upon your score;
and have you not sins enough of your own?</P>
<P>3. Their perishing will be put upon your
account. Oh what fretting and cursing will
there be at your meeting your Children in
H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll! Have you not heard of Children that
have cursed Parents upon the Gallows? Oh,
when the Word of God tells you that some evil
will befall your Children, how should this trou|ble
you! As it was said of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> that he
made <HI>Israel</HI> to sin (for all that succeeded pur|sued
<PB REF="7">
his sins) even so you, by your cursed ig|norance,
negligence and sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th may propagate
sin and misery from Generation to Generati|on,
to your Children.</P>
<P>We are to look upon this duty as one of the
prime Ordinances of divine institution: there
was Family teaching before there was any
other teaching. 'Tis the opinion of an eminent
Divine, that more Children are seasoned with
grace by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ction of Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ents than by
preaching. Towns are made up of Families,
and where they are wicked in Towns, King|doms
cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e righteous. Our misery begins
in bad Families. This duty of Catechizing
therefore is of as great weight, as any which
is commanded in the word of God. Thus far
he whose name I shall conceal, because I have
published it without his privity and consent,
though I hope not against his liking and ap|probation.
If any of you shall please dili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ently
and impartially to examine Concord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nces,
and most Catechisms; you will soon find that
the former do furnish us rather with sounds
than sense; and that in the latter, upon com|paring
the truths and the alledged Texts to|gether,
there is so wide a distance, that you
will the better perceive the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fficulty of our
present undertaking (notwithstanding all the
forementioned helps) than at first, possibly, you
<PB REF="8">
have imagined. If you find any pertinency of
the Scriptures produced for confirmation of
the truths they refer unto in this Explication,
I know it will be acceptable to you, and it is no
less than what I have endeavoured after. If
you espie many proofs under any Principle of
Religion, it is either because that the truths
there are more weighty, or that the cavils
against them are more than ordinary. If you
expected the Scriptures at large, the numero|sity
of them gives you the reason against that.</P>
<P>I had once some thoughts of illustrating the
mysterie of the Trinity of Persons, by some apt
Figure or Resemblance, and of placing it in
the Catechism; but for the avoiding of all oc|casion
of offence to the weak I have affixed it
here: And of all Figures, <HI>Keplers</HI> Circle
seems most artificial and correspondent with
this glorious mystery.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>IN this Scheme or Figure you have a Cen|ter,
and a Circumference, and an Inter
space, and yet but one Circle: So that there
are three Persons, and yet but one God. These
three are not divided; For it is not a Center,
or Interspace, separate from the Circumfe|rence:
But these are distinguished in their
incommunicable properties in their order, and
in their operation (upon a supposition of mo|tion)
The Center is the beginning (as is easie
to be observed in drawing the Circle) the
Circumference is a resultance from the Center
alone, the Interspace from the Center and
the Circumference.</P>
<P>These are Co-equal; the Center and the Cir|cumference,
and the Interspace are equidistant
every where, each one from other: And
the Center is no more a Circle without a Cir|cumference,
than the Circumference and In|terspace
without a Center.</P>
<P><PB REF="9">Consubstantial; The Center is constituent
of the Circle, not a part from but together
with the Circumference and the Interspace.</P>
<P>Co-eternal; It is no Center without a
Circumference; and no sooner is the Circum|ference
drawn, but you find the Interspace.</P>
<P>Doubtless there is Vnity in Trinity in all
things, had we but light and eyes to espy it.</P>
<P>You will find annexed to the Explication
a Discau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">se out of <HI>Acts</HI> 8 30. where you
will meet with some Rules (which have ob|tained
in Divinity) for your better under|standing,

Scriptures: If you be of that select numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r
that cannot content your selves with bare
reading, but labour to understand what you
read; they are chiefly and more especially
designed for you. And that you may under|stand

those truths more distinctly which will make
you wise to Salvation, is the main purp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rt

Old and New Testament<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Eph. 2. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How are these Books called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are called the holy Scriptures<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 3. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why are these Books so called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because they were written by Pen-men
inspired by God infallibly to that end.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How do you know that the Books
of the Old and New Testament are the
Word?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Papists grant the Protestants, that
all the Books which they receive are the cer|tain
Word of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But how will you convince an In|fidel,
that the Doctrine taught in these
Books is the certain Word of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Testimony of the Church is of
great weight and importance in this matter.
<PB N="5" REF="11">
By the Church we understand the whole com|pany
of Believers, who have professed the
true Faith; whether those who received the
Doctrine of the holy Scriptures from the Pro|phets
and Apostles, or those who lived after:
whose Testimony</P>
<P>1. Is profitable to prepare the heart, and
to move it to believe.</P>
<P>2. And of all humane Testimonies (where|by
the Author of any Book that hath, is,
or shall be extant, can be proved) the greatest,
both in respect of the multitude, wisdom,
honesty, faithfulness of the witnesses; and
the likeness, constancy, and continuance of
the Testimony it self.</P>
<P>3. But this Testimony is only humane.</P>
<P>4. Not the only, nor the chief whereby
the Truth and Divinity of this Doctrine is
confirmed.</P>
<P>5. Neither can it be the ground of Divine
Faith and Assurance. And therefore besides
this Testimony,</P>
<P>There are four other several infallible
Testimonies of Gods Spirit, which (though
each of them alone is convincing, yet) all
together make up that full evidence that will
be Ground of Divine Faith and Assurance
to an Infidel.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Which are those four witnesses?</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12"><HI>A.</HI> They are, 1. Antecedently&punc; The Spirit
of Prophecie, foretelling things to come so long
before.</P>
<P>2. Constitutively, or inherently, The Image
of God that unimitable character of Divini|ty
which animates this Doctrine.</P>
<P>3. Concomitantly, The multitude of evi|dent
and uncontrolled Miracles wrought for
this very end to confirm it. And</P>
<P>4. Subsequently, The extraordinary suc|cess
it hath in the world, which will convince
a very Infidel that it is the very Word of
God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the first witness of the
Spirit?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Antecedently, The Spirit of Pro|phecy.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> What mean you by that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A continuance of wonderful Prophe|cies,
foretelling things to come, so long be|fore,<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 15. and 12. 3. and 49. 10. Dan. 9. 24.</NOTE> marked with their circumstances;

<P><PB N="7" REF="12"><HI>A.</HI> 2. Constitutively, or inherently The

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Wherein is the Image and super|scription
of God, or that unimitable
character of Divinity which animates and
constitutes this Doctrine, apparent?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is apparent in the matter, and the
method, and the stile.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is the Image of God appa|rent
in the matter?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. As this Doctrine contains superna|tural

<P><HI>A.</HI> It explicates unto us the Nature, Pro|perties
and high Acts of God, purely and
holily.</P>
<P>2. It describes the Person of Christ, so
fitly, excellently, and conveniently, that if
the mind of man consider it attentively, it
must acknowledge, it doth exceed the
reach of a finite understanding.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="13">3. It discovers to us the corruption and
misery of man by nature, the incomprehensi|ble
Love of God in Iesus Christ towards
man, that happy reconciliation (if we may
so speak) of his Iustice and Mercy by his
infinite wisdom, ordaining Iesus Christ to be
our Mediator.</P>
<P>4. It unfolds the Covenant of Grace,
which God made with man after his fall;
all which can be drawn from no Fountain
but Divine Revelation<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 2. 7, 10. Eph. 3. 4, 5. Col. 1. 25, 26.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> 2. As the Method of the whole Do|ctrine
of the holy Scriptures set together, is
the most admirable and perfect in the world;

Authority.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But the gift of Miracles is ceased?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Although it be; yet, 1. The History
of them is so certain from natural Princi|ples,
that its unpossible there should be any

<P><HI>A.</HI> For then there must be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re Miracles

<P><HI>A.</HI> Of great use.</P>
<P>Q. Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> For he that is not able to examine
the History, which reports the Miracles to
him, may be able to find upon his Soul the
Image of God imprinted by the Gospel, and
to know that the Gospel hath that in it self,
which it imprints upon others; and that it

they give life to other things, as God hath

<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Men may without suspicion of

<P>2. We are not without the sight of God;
For,</P>
<P>1. God is seen in his works<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. The Fathers have seen him by sundry
visions; and <HI>Moses</HI> saw the similitude of
the Lord, or his back parts: but his face
can no man see. It pleased God to appear
to them of old not as he is, but as he vouch|safed
to manifest himself to them: For if
they had seen him as he is, then all of them
<PB N="24" REF="21">
had seen him after one manner because he is
one: And this sight of God was also ex|ternal.</P>
<P>3. It hath pleased him in more comforta|ble
manner to reveal himself to his Saints
by his Word, by which they behold his beauty
in his Temple, and with open face see his
Image as it is represented to them in the
mirror of the Gospel, and are transformed
into the same.</P>
<P>4. God is seen by inward contemplation,
and this sight is the more excellent than the
rest, because it is more inward.</P>
<P>5. He is seen by Faith<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>6. The Faithful have the clearest sight of
God in Heaven. Here their Faith is turned

not worthy the name of sight, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 12.</P>
<P>7. God is to be seen in the face of Iesus
Christ, who is the brightness of his glory
and the express Image of his Person; And
that we might both know that God is, and
what he is, this only begotten Son of God

<HI>Adam</HI> was the common head and

natural tempers and constitutions.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But why is the corruption of mans
whole nature commonly called Original sin,
since that is not a Scripture name?</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P>Q. How prove you that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By these two Reasons,</P>

<P>Q. But seeing Iesus tasted Death for
every man, doth not the Gospel relieve im|penitent
unbelievers?</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="30"><HI>A,</HI> The Gospel finds them, and every
one in a state of Condemnation: Those
who believe, it proclaims deliverance unto
and relieves them; but those who through
unbelief reject it, and<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Acts 13. 46.</NOTE> put it from them,
and judge themselves unworthy of ever|lasting
life, it leaves such as it found
them, <HI>viz.</HI> under the Condemnation of
the Old Covenant, since they refuse the
pardoning mercy of the New.</P>
<P>Q. You have now satisfied us that the
first Covenant is neither fully executed nor
abrogated; But how is it released, or dis|penced
with?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By super-inducing a New Cove|nant

of the new, shall be exempted from the
rigour and extremity, <HI>i. e.</HI> from the eter|nal
<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Joh. 3. 16</NOTE> condemnation of the old; although
he may be liable to the miseries of this
life, and to the first Death.</P>
<P>Q&punc; Is the Covenant of works, as to its
execution upon such as are in the Covenant
of Grace, in the chief part restrained, al|though
in some part inflicted?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Q. In the chief part restrained, and in
some part inflicted; what do you mean by
that?</P>

<P>Q. But because generals are obscure, tell
us particularly, for the clearer understand|ing
of this Mysterie, what obligation the
first Covenant laies on sinful man?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A double obligation; first, in re|ference
to what is past. And secondly,
in reference to the future.</P>
<P>Q What obligation doth it lay on him,
in reference to what is past?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It requires satisfaction, and repa|ration
from him, for his sin in break|ing
it<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ro. 6. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q What, in reference to the future?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It requires perfect conformity still
as at the first, and absolute obedience to
all Gods commands, being the eternal
debt of the reasonable creature to
that God, that made it in his own Image.</P>
<P>Q. Is it possible for us to satisfie Gods in|jured
Law for our first breach?</P>

<P>Q. Doth the Covenant of Grace relieve
us as to both these cases, and dispence with
the rigour of the Law?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Q. How doth it relieve us as to the first
obligation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It comforts us with the good news
that the Son of God hath satisfied his Fa|thers
Justice; and if we believe but in
him, God will accept of us, as if we had
satisfied in our own persons. [The case the
Law leaves us in, is well expressed,
<HI>Isa.</HI> 33. 14. and <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 31. But the
relief the Gospel brings us, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
language, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 33, 34. you have both
together excellently, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33. 10, 11.]</P>
<P>Q. How, as to the second?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The New Covenant dispenceth
with the rigour of that too; and justified
and pardoned persons shall not lose all
again upon the least defailance; therefore
the Gospel proclaims pardon of sin upon
Repentance, and acceptance of sincere en|deavours
to obey him.</P>
<P>Q God gave the Law from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI>

imperfect performances, in the Book of

should be recorded in the Book of Gods re|membrance,
since the best of them are im|perfect,
and we do daily break the Com|mandments
of God in thought, word and
deed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If there be a willing mind, it is
well accepted according to that we have,
and not according to that we have not.
And the Commandments of God may be
reputed as done&punc; when whatsoever is not
done is pardoned. Thus doth the can|dour
of the Gospel dispence with the ri|gour
of the Law<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Mat. 11. 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. But how doth it stand with Gods ve|racity
and immutability having once de|clared
that the soul that sinneth shall die,
to contradict it by declaring, That he that
believeth shall never die, but have Eternal
Life?<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Joh. 11. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="32"><HI>A.</HI> We must look upon threatenings as
a part of the Law, declaring the dueness
of the punishment, what the offender
hath deserved to suffer; Not as predicti|ons
of the event, any more than Thou
shalt, and Thou shalt not in the com|mand,
are Predictions: but only are ex|pressive
of the dueness of obedience.</P>
<P>Q. How do the Old and New Covenant
differ?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They differ more especially, these
two waies,</P>
<P>1. In their tenor; the tenor of the
Old is, <HI>Obey</HI> [perfectly] <HI>and live, sin
and die;</HI> The tenor of the New is, <HI>Be|lieve

<P>2. The New Covenant admits of Re|pentance,
which the Old doth not.</P>
<P>Q. But must not a believer acknowledge
perfect obedience to be still his duty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because this honours the equity of
Gods Commandments.</P>
<P>Q. And hath the Redeemer then by
making this one of the Conditions of the
Gospel-Covenant, given his Father his Law
back again?</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="33"><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Doth he not repeal it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, it's still the Rule of life, and
every Commandment still obligeth a Be|liever.</P>
<P>Q. What hath Christ then done for us?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Christ hath only released us from
the condemning power of the Law, not
the commanding power of it.</P>
<P>Q. How understand you that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We must still press after perfecti|on;
but though we fall short of it, we
shall not die for it: Christ having Re|deemed
us from the curse of the Law,
being made a curse for us; He leaves us
under the Government and Command of
the Law.</P>
<P>Q. But have you any Scripture-warrant
for what you say in this matter?</P>
<P>A. <HI>Yes, the whole matter is excellent|ly
expressed,</HI> 1 Ioh. 2. 1. My little Chil|dren,
these things write I unto you, that
you sin not: And if any man sin we have
an advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ
the righteous.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> But is justifying Faith solitary with|out
all attendants?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, justifying Faith hath two
Daughters that inseparably attend her.</P>
<P>1. Repentance: Here sinful man re|tracts
and undoes his faults, acknow|ledgeth
his transgressions, rents his heart
weeps, smites upon his breast, and cries
What have I done? laments after the
Lord, and abhors himself in dust and
ashes: He executes the Law upon him|self;
and since God excuseth him from
the punishment, he accuseth himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="69" REF="43">
the guilt, and condemns himself to the
shame of his sin; and hereby the sinner
honours the equity of the threatning by
his tears, acknowledging that his blood
was due.</P>
<P>2. Newness of life: Here the sinner
acknowledgeth perfect obedience to be
still his duty, which honors the equity of
Gods Commandments<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Rom. 16. 26</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But that with all requisite distinctness
we may apprehend this great affair, let us
take a view of some of the most considerable
and important causes which concur to the
producing this excellent effect, the discharge
and Iustification of a sinner, and state their
several interests and concernments in their
respective influences upon and contributions
towards it, because Iustification is a main
Article of our Faith; and therefore, How
doth Free-grace Iustifie?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Free-grace of God is the first
wheel that sets all the rest in motion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. How free-grace Justifieth.</NOTE>
Its contribution is that of a Proegumenal
cause, or internal motive, disposing God
to send his Son, that sinners (believing)
might be Justified freely by his grace,
through the Redemption that is in Jesus
Christ<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Joh. 3. 16 Rom. 3. 24</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But did not Christ die to render God
good to mankind?</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="44"><HI>A.</HI> Christ died not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o render God
good to mankind (he was so eternally)
but that with the honour of his Justice he
might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">xert and display his goodness,
which contriv'd and made it self this way
to break forth into the world.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is Christs satisfaction concern'd
in our Iustification?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is doubly concerned in it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. How Christs sa|tisfaction.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. In respect of God, as a Pro-catar|tick
cause (which is an external, as the
Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gumenal is an internal moving cause)
and is of infinite merit and impe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rative
power; for the sake of which God is re|conciling
himself unto the world in Christ,
not imputing their Trespasses unto them,
2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 19.</P>
<P>2. In respect of the Law of Works,
Christs satisfaction Justifieth us formally,
as our proper legal righteousness.</P>
<P>Q. Why do you call it our Righteous|ness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because it becomes imputed to us
upon our believing; Faith being our
Gospel-Title, by pleading which we
lay claim to all the benefits, accruing from
the merit of Christs performance, to all
effects, uses, and purposes, as if it had
been personally our own.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="44">Q. But why do you call it our legal Righ|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="5 letters">ness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because thereby the Law of God
owns it self fully apaid, and acquiesceth
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> it, as in full reparations, and amends
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ade unto it for the injury and dishonour

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 33, 34&punc;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. And is this our legal Righteousness
required in the first Covenant, that of
Works, which is thus imputed upon our
account, wholly without us, in our Re|demer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 21</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. But is our Evangelical Righteousness
required in the second Covenant without us,
as our legal Righteousness required in the
old is?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, for though Christ performed
the Conditions of the Law, and satis|fied
for our non-performance, yet it is
our selves that must perform the conditi|ons
of the Gospel. It is not Christ but
we that must repent and believe<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Acts 20. 21</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. But there are some that tell us that
Christ hath also performed for us the conditi|ons
<PB N="72" REF="45">
of the Gospel; that he hath believed per|fectly,
and repented perfectly, and that all is
ours: what ought we to think of this Opi|nion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If we judge of it in its clear con|sequence,
it is both absurd and blasphe|mous;

<P><HI>A.</HI> As it supposeth a perfect Saviour
to stand in need of a Saviour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Heb. 7. 26, 27</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. How is it blasphemous?</P>

<P>Q. How doth the Gospel Iustifie?</P>
<P>A. As it is the Law of Faith that
publisheth and declareth to us upon what
terms we shall be Justified<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Rom. 3. 27</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. And is the Gospel our great Charter,

<P>A. By vertue of the Law promulgated

or our keeping the Gospel-Law,
which suspends Justification upon be|lieving.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="45"><HI>Q.</HI> Doth Faith pretend to no merit or

<P><HI>A.</HI> No, but professedly avows its de|pendance

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Nor can it shew any other Title to be

only Gods sanction [Law, or Decree esta|blishing

it so highly honoureth Christ?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> May this be illustrated to us by some
apt resemblance?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, the Act of believing is as the
S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lver; but Gods authority in the Gospel|sanction,

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How doth God Iustifie?</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="46"><HI>A.</HI> God justifieth in a proper sense two

<P>Q How doth God Iustifie as a Legislator?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He Justifies as a Legislator, enacting
by his Soveraign authority that sweet and
gracious Law of the New Covenant, by
vertue of whose tenor every sinner that
believes is Justified from the Guilt of sin,
from which he could not be Justified by
the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> Acts 13. 39.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> How doth God Iustifie as a Iudge?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 2. As a Judge, he may in three
respects be said to Justifie a Believer.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Forthwith upon his believing

as a person justified; God esteems and

which he hath by believing a Title good

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> At the moment of dissoluti|on
God Justifieth as the Judge of all the

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> But eminently at the last day,
when the Ancient of daies shall take the

one by its fruitfulness in well-doing.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How doth the Spirit of God Iustifie?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 7. The Spirit of God Justifieth
two waies: First, Directly, by working
Faith in the heart, as the Author of that

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 37. What benefits do Believers re|ceive
from Christ at their Death?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The souls of Believers are at their
Death made perfect in holiness, and do
immediately pass into Glory; and their
<PB N="84" REF="51">
Bodies being still united to Christ, do rest
in their Graves till the Resurrection.</P>
<P><HI>Explic. Q.</HI> How manifold are the bene|fits
of Believers at their Death?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Twofold, 1. In respect of their
Souls.</P>
<P>2. In respect of their Bodies.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1. What benefits have Believers in

<P><HI>A.</HI> They are made perfect in holiness,

<P><HI>Q</HI> What do Papists mean by Purgatory?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They mean a state of Temporary
punishments after this life, from which
men may be released and translated into
Heaven, by the Prayers of the living
and the Sacrifice of the Mass.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. What benefits have Believers in
respect of their Bodies at Death?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Their Bodies are still united to
Christ. For, though Death doth for a
while separate their Souls from their Bo|dies,
yet it cannot separate Christ from
<PB N="85" REF="51">
either; but as when Christ died, his
Hypostatical or Personal union still re|mained,
his Divine Nature being united
both to his Soul in Heaven, and to his
Body in the Tomb on Earth: So when
Believers die, their mystical union unto
Christ still remaineth, and Christ is
united both to their Souls with him in
Glory, and to their Bodies, which are
his Members, even when they are rotting
in the Grave<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Mat. 22&punc; 33 1 Cor. 6. 15</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. They rest in their Graves, as in their
Beds, till the Resurrection<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 4. 14 Isa. 57. 2 1 Thes. 4. 16 Job 19. 25, 26, 27 Dan. 12, 2</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the Resurrection here spoken
of?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The last and general Resurrection
of all the dead that have lived in all
Ages from the beginning of the Creation;
which will be first of the righteous, and
then of the wicked at the last day<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 4. 16 John 5. 28, 29</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> How do you prove that there shall be
such a general Resurrection?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It may be undeniably proved from
the Scriptures and the power of God.
If God be of infinite power, and there|fore
can raise the dead, and infinitely true,
and in the Scriptures hath revealed that
he will raise all the dead, then there shall
be a general Resurrection; but God is
<PB N="86" REF="52">
infinite in power, and in the Scriptures
hath revealed that he will raise all the
dead, therefore there shall be a general
Resurrection. The ground of the Sad|duces
errour, who denied the Resurrecti|on,
was their ignorance of these two
great foundations of this Doctrine, name|ly,
the Scriptures and the power of
God<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Mark 12. 24</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Shall the Dead the raised with the
same body, which they had when aliu
before?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Job 19. 26, 27</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How do you prove that the Dead shal
be raised with the same Body?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because otherwise it could in no
proper sense be called a Resurrection, but
a new Creation.</P>
<P>2. Because 'tis fit the same Body that
was an instrument of righteousness, or sin
should share in the like Reward or
Punishment.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Will not the Bodies, when they are
raised, differ from what they are now?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They will not differ from what
they are now in regard of their substance
and essence; But they will exceedingly
differ in regard of their qualities.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 38. What benefits do Believer
<PB N="87" REF="52">
receive from Christ at the Resurrection?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> At the Resurrection, Believers be|ing
raised up in Glory, shall be openly
acknowledged and acquitted in the day
of Judgement, and made perfectly bles|sed
in full enjoying of God to all Eter|nity.</P>
<P><HI>Explic. Q.</HI> How many waies may the

<P>Hitherto are the matters of Faith, which
make up the first Part of the Catechism,
or what man is to believe concerning
God.</P>
<P>Now follows the second Part concern|ing
the duty which God requires of Man.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 39. What is the Duty which God re|quireth
of Man?</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="53"><HI>A.</HI> The Duty which God requireth of
Man is obedience to his revealed Will.</P>
<P><HI>Explic. Q.</HI> Doth God require any thing
to be performed by man to himself?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God requireth Duty from Man.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is that Duty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Obedience (to obey.)</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the Rule of Mans obedience
in General?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Gods revealed Will.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What mean you by that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The written Word, or the holy
Scriptures, wherein the main purport of
them is not to reveal to us the existence
or non-existence of our actions, but their
moral conveniency; nor yet future con|tingences,
&amp; whatsoever shall come to pass
in the world, but what may and ought
to be done by intelligent creatures, and
what by preventive love and enforcing
obligations God will expect from us<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Deut. 29. 29 Acts 1 6, 7 Mich. 6. 8</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> What do you mean by those obligati|ons
that enforce the Duty which God re|quireth
of man?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Those beneficial resultances, or
benefits which flow from Gods relation to
Man as his Creator, Redeemer and San|ctifier.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 40. What did God at first reveal
<PB N="90" REF="54">
to man for the Rule of his Obedience?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Rule which God at first re|vealed
to man for his obedience, was the
Moral Law.</P>
<P><HI>Explic. Q.</HI> Is not Gods secret Will the
Rule of Mans obedience?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How prove you that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Because the Will of God as se|cret
is a peculiar Treasure which he hath
put in his own power, and will keep to
himself<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Acts 1. 7 Mat. 24. 36</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. Because a man may sometimes sin
in fulfilling the secret Will of God, and
be ashamed, repenting in dust and ashes
that he hath done it<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Acts 2. 23, 36, 37, 38</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. Because all Creatures do this Will of
God, and none ever resisted it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Rom. 9. 19</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is the revealing of an event which
God hath determined, or those Actions where|by
that event shall be brought to pass, the
Rule of Mans obedience?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">1 Kings 11. 31, 35 with 2 Chron. 13. 5, 6, 7, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But are not Gods own positive and
ceremonial Laws this Rule of Mans obe|dience?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How prove you that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Because they were so burden|some
<PB N="91" REF="54">
a yoke that neither we nor the
Jews themselves were ever able to bear
them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Acts 15. 10</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. Because they were never pleasing
to God irrespectively of themselves, nei|ther
did he at all ever take delight in
these Laws themselves simply conside|red
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Psal. 40. 6 and 51. 16 Isa. 1. 11, 12</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. Because these positive Laws were
such, by which men should never obtain
Eternal Life<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 20 25 Heb. 7. 11, 19</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What Law then is that which is the
Rule of Mans obedience?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Moral Law.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why is it so called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because it hath a perpetual bind|ing
power in all Ages unto the end of
the world.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When was this revealed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> At first.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How understand you that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Two waies.</P>
<P>1. This Law was at first given to
<HI>Adam</HI> in Innocency, God having written
it on his heart; some small remainders
whereof abide yet in mans nature<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Rom. 2. 14, 15</NOTE>.</P>

Gods immediate voice, after written

Church as a perpetual Rule for their obe|dience.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 41. Wherein is the Moral Law sum|marily

<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is it to love the Lord our
<PB N="94" REF="56">
God with all our Heart, <HI>&amp;c?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It doth imply the supremacy, ar|dency
and activity of our Love, where|by
we chuse the Lord, cleave to him,
and delight in him as our chief Good,
and employ all our faculties and powers
in his service, in obedience to him out of
Love.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the summ of the second Ta|ble
of the Law?</P>

<P>1. The not worshipping and glorifying

<P>2. The giving that worship and glory

<P><HI>Q.</HI> It is Idolatry to give outward wor|ship

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Rev. 22. 8, 9</NOTE>.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Col. 3. 5</NOTE>.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 48. What are we especially taught
by these words [<HI>before me</HI>] in the first
Commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> These words, <HI>before me,</HI> in the first
Commandment, teach us, that God who
seeth all things, taketh notice of, and is
much displeased with the sin of having
any other God.</P>
<P><HI>Explic. Q.</HI> What things are to be learn'd
from these words [<HI>before me?</HI>]</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Two things,</P>
<P>1. That God seeth all things<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 13 Jer. 23. 24 Psal. 147. 5</NOTE>.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 49. Which is the second Command|ment?</P>
<P>A. <HI>The second Commandment is,</HI>
[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
Image, or any likeness of any thing that is
in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth be|neath,
or that is in the water under the

my Commandments.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 50. What is required in the second

<P><HI>A.</HI> The Second Commandment re|quireth
the receiving, observing, and

Worship and Ordinances as God hath ap|pointed

<P><HI>Explic.</HI> Q. How doth the worship, re|quired

from the worship required in the first?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The worship required in the first
Commandment hath a respect unto the
object of worship, whereby we are bound

Commandment, in reference to his Ordi|nances

<P><HI>A.</HI> He requireth the receiving, ob|serving,
and keeping of them pure and
entire.</P>
<P>Q. What is it to receive and observe Gods
Worship and Ordinances?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To receive and observe them is
heartily to entertain, embrace, and at|tend
on them as oft as opportunity is of|fered,
and to make answerable improve|ment
of them.</P>
<P>Q. What is it to keep them pure and

<P><HI>A.</HI> To take diligent heed that they be

<P>Q. How know you what Worship,
<PB N="104" REF="61">

<P><HI>A.</HI> God hath appointed all his worsh'p
and Ordinances in his Word.</P>
<P>Q. 51. What is forbidden in the second
Commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The second Commandment for|bideth
the worshipping of God by Images
or any other way not appointed in his
Word.</P>
<P><HI>Explie.</HI> Q. What are the chief sins for|bidden
in this Commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Idolatry and Superstition.</P>
<P>Q. Is it Idolatry, not only to worship
Idols instead of God, which is forbidden
in the first Commandment, but also to wor|ship
God by Images?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Isa. 45. 20 Exod. 32. 4, 5 Deut. 4. 15,&mdash;19 with 32. 5, 17, 21</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. How can persons be guilty of Idola|try
in worshipping God by Images, when
they worship the true God&punc; the God that
made the Heavens and the Earth?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because the Images of these men,
either do bear resemblance to the object of
their worship, or they do not; If they
do, then they worship false Gods, and
are guilty of gross Idolatry, there being
no similitude or likeness of the true God;
If they do not, then is ignorance the Mo|ther

<P>Q. Why can there be no manner of
similitude of the true God?</P>

made with hands, and is the unap|proachable
invisible God. <HI>Acts 17. 24.

<P>Q. The Papists worship God by Images,
the Protestants worship God without them;
which way therefore are we to worship the
true God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The way, the only infallible Judge
of Controversies hath declared unto us.</P>
<P>Q. Is the Pope this infallible Iudge?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There is no infallible Judge upon

<P>Q What other sin is chiefly forbidden in
this Commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Superstition.</P>
<P>Q. What is Superstition?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Superstition in the proper and
strict notion of the word is the wor|shipping
of Idols, or dead men, <HI>Act.</HI> 17. 22.
But this is the same with that Idolatry,
(the giving that worship and glory to

others which is due to God alone) which
is forbidden in the first Commandment.</P>
<P>Q. What is therefore Superstition in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> generally received notion, and as it is
forbidden in this Commandment?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is when things are either abhor|red
or observed with a zealous or fearful,
but erroneous relation to God: by means
of which the superstitious serve either the
true God with needless Offices, or de|fraud
him of necessary Duties; or bestow
such honours and service upon others,
as is proper for, and should be peculiar
for him only. Or,
<Q>More plainly thus,</Q></P>
<P>It is the worshipping of God in any
other way, or by any other means than
what he hath appointed in his Word;
called Ordinances, the Commandments
and Doctrines of men<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Col. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How manifold is this Superstition?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Twofold, Affirmative, and Nega|tive.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is Affirmative Superstition?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That whereby the Superstitious
serve the true God with needless Offices.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> And what the Negative?</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="63"><HI>A.</HI> That whereby men out of a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">|pulous
Conscience, or ignorant fear of

<P>Q. Doth the Scripture warrant this

<P>Q. 1. What is the Idolatry and Super|stition
of the Church of Rome?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The worshipping of the Bread and
Wine in the Eucharist, out of a false and
groundless perswasion, that they are sub|stantially
changed into the Body and
Blood of Christ.</P>
<P>2. The worshipping and invocation of
Saints and Angels; and particularly of
the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which hath now for
some Ages been a principal part of their
Religion.</P>
<P>3. Their worshipping of Images:
Which practice (notwithstanding all
their distinctions about it, which are no

Holy-daies; Their adding Cream,

<P><HI>Q.</HI> What if the Doctrine of Transub|stantiation
be not true?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Then by the confession of several
of their own learned Writers they are
guilty of gross Idolatry.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Doth not the Bread in the Communi|on
remain Bread after the words of Conse|cration?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, the Scripture expresly calls it
so after the words of Consecration.
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 26, 27, 28.</P>
<P>Q. But what if the Bread be transub|stanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">te
and turned into the very Body of
Christ?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Then all mens senses are deceived
in a plain sensible matter, wherein 'tis as
hard for them to be deceived, as in any
thing in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> For two things can hardly be
imagined more different, a little bit
<PB N="110" REF="64">
of Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er, and the whole Body of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
man.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But what if the Testimony of sens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
be not to be relied upon?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Then no man is sure that Christian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|ty
it self is true.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> For the utmost assurance that the
Apostles had of the Truth of Christiani|ty,
was the Testimony of their own
senses concerning our Saviours Miracles.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> And what if the Testimony of sense <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
to be relied upon?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Then it plainly follows that no
man (no, not the Apostles themselves)
had more reason to believe Christianity to
be true, than every man hath to believe
Transubstantiation to be false.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But if the case be so plain, a man
would think that at least the Teachers and
Guides of that Church should be sensible
of it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Why, they are so, and afraid the
People should be so too; and therefore
by their corrupt Glosses and Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">risai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">al
Traditions in their interpreting the holy
Scriptures, they tye up and keep the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ople
in ignorance of the true meaning of those
places, which do more expresly condemn

their damnable Idolatrous practises, and
their superstitious customs; and in their
ordinary Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">chisms and Manuals of De|votion,
they leave out the second Com|mandment,
and divide the tenth into
two to make up the Number; lest if the
common people should know it, their
Consciences should startle at the doing of
a thing so directly contrary to the plain
command of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> And is it not well observed by the

Objections and Arguments of the Pro|testants

the other Blasphenies and absurd Doctrines
of the Papists; they do all unanimously be|take
themselves to the authority of their

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, it doth very much concern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
all so to do; because our mistake herein
will greatly hazzard our everlasting Sal|vation.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> And are not they certainly mistaken
that adventure all, even all their everlasting

those very things which must be sup|posed
antecedent to the belief of any such au|thority:
As 1. The common sense of man|kind.
2. The force of a Divine Law.
And 3. The liberty of Iudgement concern|ing
truth and falshood?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> And doth not the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>
so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, and thereby forfeits its own
authority over men.</P>
<P>1. It requires things contrary to com|mon
sense; as in the Eucharist, it re|quires
all its members to deny what they
see, and handle, and smell, and taste to
be Bread, to be true Bread; and to be|lieve
that the same individual Body may
<PB N="113" REF="65">
be in a thousand places at once, and that
things whose nature it is to be in another,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> subsist without their proper subject.</P>
<P>2. It requires things contrary to the
force and reason of a divine Law; as it
hath left out the second Commandment,
and hath made it lawful to give religious
worship to Images, and hath taken away
from the people their share of the Cup in
the Eucharist.</P>
<P>3. It takes away all liberty of judge|ment
concerning truth and falshood in
Religion. For this is a natural right
which every man hath to judge for him|self:
And they that take this away, may
as well command all men to put out their
eyes, that they may the better follow
their Guides. But the other is so much
worse, because it is an assault upon our
understandings; it is a robbing us of
the greatest Talent God hath committed
to our management, it is a Rape upon
our best faculties, and prostituting them
to the Lusts of spiritual Tyrants; it is
not captivating our understandings to the
obedience of Faith, but enslaving them to
the proud and domineering usurpations of
men; wherein they would do by us as
the <HI>Philistins</HI> did by <HI>Sampson;</HI> they

would put our eyes, that we might g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ind

over us, and hath the sole Authority to

therefore we ought by vertue of our al|legiance,

<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the force of this second
reason?</P>

<P><HI>Q</HI> But what do you think of the Au|ricular
Confession of sin according to the

have been, and that he is bound upon pain
of Damnation to confess all his mortal sins
unto a Priest, even his most secret sins in
heart and thought, with all the considerable

matters necessary to Salvation?</P>

<P><HI>Q</HI> In Preparation what must be done?</P>

instituted by Christ, wherein by sensible

to Believers.</P>
<P><HI>Explic.</HI> Q. What did the Word Sacra|ment

<P>A. Now it is used to signifie the seals
of the Covenant whereby the Lord doth
bind himself in Christ Jesus to be merciful
to us; and we bind our selves to be true

<P><PB N="184" REF="101">A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q How do the Sacrameats seal to all
even to unbelievers?</P>
<P>A. 1. As Circumcision was a Seal of
the righteousness of Faith [or of the
Covenant] as well when <HI>Ishmael</HI> received
it, as when <HI>Abraham</HI> received it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4 11 with Gen. 17 Dr. Light|foot.</NOTE>. God
is everlastingly true; and these are really
Seals whosoever recelves them. Many
persons take the same Physick; the ope|ration
is not the same, the Physick is the
same. And if we might call the Tree of
Life a Seal, it retains the nature of a sign,
though <HI>Adam</HI> never tasted of it. The
Rain-bow is a Covenant, though there
be thousands in the world that never
knew it was a Covenant. And it is the
use and proper work of our Sacraments
to commemorate and seal.</P>

<HI>Ier. 2. 31. O Generation, see ye the word
of the Lord.</HI> In the Sacraments are writ|ten
in small Characters, what at large are
found in the works of God. And Faith
acts upon these Symbols upon a doctrinal
notion, as they are teaching Ordinances.
They testifie, as a sign Christs Love, as a
Seal Gods faithfulness. The Word of
God is given us that we may believe,
<PB N="185" REF="101">
and that we may be strong in Faith: So
likewise the Sacraments are given us not
only to believe, but for our increase in
Faith. And as the word Jesus Christ is
evidently set forth crucified before our
eyes, so do the Sacraments as the Oracles
of God teach us plainly the mysterie of
Faith, and the way of Salvation.</P>

<P><HI>Q</HI> 93. Which are the Sacraments of

<P><HI>A.</HI> The Sacraments of the New Testa|ment
are Baptism and the Lords Supper.</P>
<P><HI>Explic. Q.</HI> Were there other Sacra|ments
under the Old Testament, as Circum|cision
and the Passover?</P>
<P>A. <HI>Yes.</HI> Gen. 17. 10. Exod. 12. 43, 47.</P>

the New Testament?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How doth that appear?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Because when the number of
Sacraments were most necessary (as un|der
the Law) there were but two: and
therefore (ours succeeding in the room
of them) there can be no more.</P>
<P>2. Because these two Seals do fully

Are not these properly and truly
Sacraments, instituted by our Lord Iesus
Christ, and necessary to the Salvation of
Mankind?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The nature of a Sacrament agreeth
not to them. 1. Because they are not
all proper to the Church, but common
(as Marriage) to the Heathen. 2. They
are not all instituted by Christ, as perpe|tual
<PB N="189" REF="103">
standing Ordinance. 3. They do not
consist of an outward sign (as Penace)
and inward Grace. 4. The Covenant
of Grace is not sealed in any of them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But is not Extream Vnction a Sacra|ment
instituted by Christ as a perpetual
standing Ordinance; when every sick man
is enjoyned, <HI>James</HI> 5. 14. to call for the
Elders, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">se standing perpetuated Officers,
that they may pray over him, anointing him
with Oyl in the Name of the Lord?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P><HI>Q&punc;</HI> Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Because the anointing spoken of
in S. <HI>Iames</HI> was frequently omitted by
the Apostles themselves in their work|ing
of cures, and was indifferently ei|ther
used or not used by them. In
the Gospels many such cures are wrought
without it; and so in the <HI>Acts,</HI> by taking
by the hand, by embracing, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. 7.
and 20. 10. and by <HI>Peter's</HI> bare word,
<HI>Chap.</HI> 9. 34. and so again, <HI>verse</HI> 40. And
by <HI>Paul</HI>'s b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re word, <HI>Chap.</HI> 14. 10. and
16. 18. and by his touching linnen
cloaths, <HI>Chap.</HI> 19. 12. All which diffe|rent
ways of healing the sick do sufficient|ly
evince that the usage of Oyl as a
bare ceremony, was not instituted by
<PB N="190" REF="104">
Christ, or any way commanded to be
continued by the Apostles, or their Suc|cessors
in the Church, even while the
gift of healing did continue among
them.</P>
<P>2. Because that anointing with Oyl in
the Name of the Lord, was never used
on any other design than to demonstrate
the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 6. 13</NOTE> miraculousness of the work, which
was wrought without any contribution
of natural means; and therefore is not
now of any propriety or fitness for use,
when the gift of miraculous healing is
ceased in the Church.</P>
<P>3. That anointing was designed on
purpose for the recovery of the sick,
whereas Extream Unction (if the coine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
of Sacraments have not miscalled it)
must needs be supposed to be used only
as a V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">and to those that depart out of this
world, and then only when it is thought
certain that they will die.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 94. What is Baptism?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Baptism is a Sacrament, wherein
the washing with water, in the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, doth signifie and seal
our ingrafting into Christ, and partaking
of the benefits of the Covenant of

<P><HI>A.</HI> It is a Sacrament.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the sacramental Element
in Baptism?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Water<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 3. 11 Acts 8. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, 38</NOTE>, (without mixture.)</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the sacramental actions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. The Ministers blessing and con|secrating
the Water.</P>
<P>2. The right applying of it to the
party to be Baptiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d, diving, or dipping
him into it, or sprinkling him with it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How ought the Minister to bless and
consecrate the Water?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. By opening to them that are
present the Doctrine of Baptism, and
the right institution and use of it, what
outward Mysteries are signified, and seal|ed
up by that outward sign.</P>
<P>2. By acknowledging in the Name of
the Congregation Mans natural pollution,
that we stand in need of spiritual wash|ing;
by giving thanks to God the Father
for giving his Son for a propitiation for
our sins, and appointing his blood to be
a Fountain to the House of <HI>Israel</HI> to wash
in; and for ordaining this service to be a
<PB N="192" REF="105">
Sacrament and Seal of so great a mysterie.</P>
<P>3. By making profession of Faith in
Gods promises in that behalf, and pray|ing
that they be made good unto the par|ty
that is to receive the Seal thereof:
For as every thing is sanct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fied by the
Word of God and Prayer; so in especial
manner the sacramental water in B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ptism
is blessed and consecrated by the Word of
Institution and Prayer to God for a
blessing upon his own Ordinance.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> Is the action of diving or dipping
essential to the Sacrament? Or is there any
ground and warrant for sprinkling, which
is mostly used with us in these cold Coun|tries?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The action of sprinkling water up|on
the Face of the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ptized is very
warrantable; especially upon young Chil|dren
in cold Countries, to whom diving
or dipping might be dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> What ground hath the Church for
this practice?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cause neither dipping nor
sprinkling seem to be essential to Baptism,
but washing and applying water to the

<HI>Ephes.</HI> 5. 26.</P>
<P>2. Because, as in the other Sacrament,
<PB N="193" REF="105">
a spoonful of Wine is as significant as a
whole Gallon; so here a handful of Wa|ter
as a whole River.</P>
<P>3. The action of sprinkling bears fit
resemblance with the inward grace as
well as dipping, and hath Authority in
the Scripture of truth. Read 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 2.
<HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 24. where is speech of the
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ,
and the blood of sprinkling speaking bet|ter
things than that of <HI>Abel.</HI></P>
<P>4. It is not unlikely that the Apostles
Baptized as well by sprinkling or pouring
upon, as by diving or dipping into: Since
we read of divers Baptized in Houses, as
well as others in Rivers.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Whose Office is it to Baptize?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> None but the lawfully ordained
Ministers may Baptize. <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19, 20.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In whose Name are we to be Bap|tized?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean by Baptizing in

<P><HI>A.</HI> Baptism is not to be administred

<P><HI>A.</HI> It is not to be administred to any
that are out of the visible Church.</P>
<P><HI>Q&punc;</HI> What mean you by the visible Church?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The visible Church is a company
of people called from all false worships
<PB N="195" REF="106">
and Religions, confessedly to worship the
true God according to his Word<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Acts 2. 47&punc; and 4. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> and 6. 7 Joh. 9. 22 and 12. 42 Phil. 2. 10, 11&punc;</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How long is Baptism to be withheld

Christ alone is the Head?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Mat. 28. 19</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But how do you prove that the In|fants
of such as are member of the visible
Church may and ought to be Baptized?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Because to such Infants apper|taineth
the Covenant and the thing sig|nified<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Acts 2. 39 Mat. 19. 14&punc;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. Because whole Families were Bap|tized,
and there is pregnant probability,
that there were some Infants among them
of those House-holds. <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 14, 15, 33.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But suppose there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> were no Children
in those Families; how then is it required
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t our hands to Baptize Infants?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Those that plead this, plead their
own ignorance; 1. Because in the Jewish
Church, this was their custom, when Pa|rents
came to be Baptized, Children came
<PB N="196" REF="107">
be Baptized also, and their whole Family.
And secondly, If there were Children in
those Families; as that Jewish custom
(over-ballancing the others groundless
supposition) renders it most probable;
be it known to all such unnatural Parents
as reject Infant Baptism, that they har|den
their hearts against their own flesh.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because Children are parts of Pa|rents;
and by this contempt of Baptism
they reject the Counsel of God against
themselves, and their Children<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ink. 7. 30</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q&punc;</HI> What other reason have you for In|fant
Baptism?</P>
<P>A. 3. Children were ever admitted to
the sign and Seal of this Covenant, which
of old was Circumcision; and Baptism
succeeds in the room of Circumcision.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How doth that appear?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. It appears in that the Apostle of
the Circumcision commands Baptism up|on
the same ground that Circumcision
was<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Act. 1. 38, 39 with Gen. 17. 12 and 21. 3, 4 and Luk 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">9 and 2. 21</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. Because St. <HI>Paul</HI> in <HI>Col.</HI> 2. gives to
Baptism the very Name of Circumcision,
to teach us that it succeeds i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But if Baptism ought to be ad|ministred
to all those to whom Circumcision
<PB N="197" REF="107">
was administred, because Baptism succeeds
Circumcision; by the same reason the Eu|charist
ought to be administred to all those
who did eat the Paschal Lamb, seeing the
Eucharist succeeds the Iewish Passover:
But you stay longer before you admit your
Children to the Lords Supper, than the
Iews did before they admitted their Children
to the eating of the Paschal Lamb.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Jews admitted their Children
to eat of the Paschal Lamb, so soon as
they were able to eat flesh, and to ask
their Fathers the reason of that legal cere|mony;
and we defer the admitting of
ours to the Lords Supper until they be
capable of those dispositions which God
requires; and are able to examine them|selves
according to the command of the
Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. Let a man examine
himself; and so let him eat of that Bread,
and drink of that Cup.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 96. What is the Lords Supper?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Lords Supper is a Sacrament
wherein by giving and receiving Bread
and Wine according to Christs appoint|ment,
his Death is shewed forth, and the
worthy receivers are not after a corporal
and carnal manner, but by Faith made
partakers of his Body and Blood, with

all his benefits unto their spiritual nou|rishment
and growth in Grace.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because it was instituted at that
time after the Paschal Supper was end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Are we therefore bound to celebrate it
alwaies at the same time?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, because there is no command
for it, nor is there the same reason for it
now as then; this circumstance of time
not obliging us to do it after Supper any
more than the fashion of lying along
binds us to the using of the same posture;
both of them being upon occasion of the
Paschal Supper then.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why do you super add the circum|stance
and limitation of that present time?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because the first Paschal Supper
in <HI>Egypt</HI> was eaten standing; but after|wards
sitting and lying along, leaning
one on anothers breasts, in sign of their
rest and security, otherwise than they
had in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the sacramental Elements
in the Lords Supper?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Bread and Wine.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="108"><HI>Q</HI> What are the sacramental actions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Breaking the Bread, giving and

<P><HI>A.</HI> The Body and Blood of Christ.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Christs Body being broken for us.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why must the people partake of the
Elements of both kinds?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because all that were present at
the first Sacrament, given by the Lord
Jesus himself, did so.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> How d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th that appear?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the plain express words of
Scripture. <HI>Mat. 26. 26, 27. Mark</HI> 14.
22. 23.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But all present at the first Sacrament
were the twelve, whom Christ sent forth as
Apostles to Preach the Word and administer
the Sacraments, and therefore they and
their Successors only had the priviled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e to
drink of the Cup?</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="109"><HI>A.</HI> 1. By this argument the Bread
may be taken away from the people too,
and so they would have no right to any
part of this Sacrament: And what is this
but egregious sacriledge in robbing the
people of their highest Church-privi|ledge?</P>
<P>2. The practice and writings of the
ancient Church in this matter, which is
the best way to explicate any such diffi|culty
in Scripture, is a clear Testimony
that both the Bread and the Wine belong
to all the people, in the Name of the
twelve Disciples at that time.</P>

that in this Sacrament the Body and

Christ, are truly, really and substantially
<PB N="202" REF="110">
present; and that the whole substance of the
Bread is converted into his Body, and the
whole substance of the Wine into his
Blood?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, should we do it, our Senses,
our Reason, and the Word of God would
give us the Lye: We perceive by our
Senses that the Bread and Wine are the

gives us light; than we are fully per|swaded
that the Divinity of Jesus Christ
is every where, and his humane nature

<P><HI>A.</HI> It will be an Introduction and a
very good help to us for the right under|standing
of the said Texts, to consider
those observations taken from the Jewish
phrases and customs used in this matter,
<HI>viz.</HI> 1. That the Lamb that was drest
in the Paschal Supper and set upon the
Table, was wont to be called the Body
of the Passover, or the Body of the Pas|chal
Lamb; and probably Christ alludes
to this phrase, when he saith, <HI>This is my
Body;</HI> as if he should say, the Paschal
Lamb and the Body of it, (<HI>i. e.</HI> the re|presentation
of that on the Table in the
Jewish Feast) that was the memorial of de|liverance
out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and type of your
deliverance out of the state of sin and
death, I will now have abrogated; and
<PB N="205" REF="111">
do now institute Bread and Wine instead
of that Paschal Lamb, that you may
hereafter retain and continue to posterity
a Memorial and Symbol of me, who am
the Lamb of God which taketh away the
sin of the world, and am now about to
be sacrificed for you. This for the words
[<HI>My Body and my Blood:</HI>) But then
2. For the whole phrase, and form of
speech, [<HI>This is my Body, this is my
Blood.</HI>] It seems to be answerable to
(and substituted instead of) the Paschal
form (<HI>This is the Bread of affliction, which
our Fathers eat in Egypt:</HI> or, <HI>This is the
unleavened Bread,</HI> &amp;c. or, <HI>This is the
Passover.</HI>] And therefore the Bread and
the Wine in the Eucharist are no more the
very Body and Blood of Christ, than that
Bread which the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> eat in
the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was that Identical,
that very Bread of affliction which their
Fathers eat in the Land of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is not this Popish Doctrine&punc; that the
Bread of the Eucharist is transubstantiated
into the Body, and the Wine into the Blood
of Christ, a very ancient Doctrine?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is but four hundred fifty nine
years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Coun|cil of <HI>La|teran,</HI> 1215.</NOTE>
since it was declared by Pope <HI>Inno|cent</HI>
the third, in the Council of <HI>Lateran.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="112"><HI>Q</HI> Is not this impossible and incompre|hensible
error of Transubstantiation to be re|jected
with our utmost Detestation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Doth not this Doctrine suppose a silly
Priest to do that which all the Angels cannot
do, and that is to make his Maker, as the
Papists call the Host, and the people to de|vour
their God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> Can they justifie this by Gods omnipo|tency,
that God is able to effect it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, this is no better argument
than the <HI>Turks</HI> may justifie most of the
sopperies of their <HI>Alcoran</HI> by.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What reasons and grounds have you
for the rejection of this abomination?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There are two grounds especially
for the rejection of it.</P>
<P>1. The Idolatry and Sacriledge which
doth ensue upon it, and that is the Ado|ration
and worship of the Host, a piece
of Bread, and the mutilation or maiming
of the Sacrament by Bread only, and
the propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ him|self
in the Mass, who was once only of|fered
up to God upon the Cross, all
which are the issue of this error.</P>
<P>2. The Monsters of contradiction and
<PB N="207" REF="112">
absurdity to sense and reason, which fol|low
thereupon. It was begotten by
feigned Miracles and fabulous Legends,
and is the Mother of Blasphemies and in|extricable
absurdities, and hath set Faith
it self on the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ck, and surpasseth all the
Harlotry that the Adulterate Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> that Mother of Fornications, ever
brought forth.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> If you can but make good this high
charge you have drawn up against that most
degenerate and corrupted Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
in this one error of Transubstantiation being
comprehensive of all errors; (Pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l <HI>Rome</HI>
being nothing else but the worst corruption
of the once most famous Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
whose Faith was spoken of throughout the
world) you may easily perswade all the
friends of the Bride, the Lambs Wife, to
abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">inate all the other Fornications of that
Whorish Church: And because the Prote|stants
Arguments against Transubstantiati|on
may convince us how fully they have made
good this charge, pray produce a few of the
many Arguments they have against this Mo|ther
Error?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Suppose Christ sitting at the
Table with his Disciples, and eating th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
Bread, and drinking this Cup first, as
<PB N="208" REF="113">
the custom at the Paschal Supper was,
and as the Papists generally, and the Fa|thers
hold, and we deny not, because the
Scripture seems plain for it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26. 29.
<HI>Hence forth I will not drink of the fruit of the
Vine;</HI> supposing therefore this, How is
it possible or imaginable that he should
eat himself? or how can he sit at Table,
and yet be in the mouths of the Apostles?
Was he at the same time in the Apostles
mouths or stomachs, while he sate and
rose from Table, and discoursed those
three Chapters of <HI>Iohn</HI> 15, 16, 17. Or
while he sweat that bloody sweat in his
Agony in the Garden, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A monstrous
impossibility!</P>
<P>2. It's impossible to make that which
was before existent and in being: Can a
Father beget a Son that is already begot|ten?
Can an Architect build an House
that is already built? Can the Body of
Christ, which is before the Conversion of
the Bread, be made or produced by the
turning of Bread into it? Can he that
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and
born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> be made by pro|nouncing
of four or five words? If ever
delusions were strong, these are; For, to
make that which is made, and to unmake
<PB N="209" REF="113">
that which is made, are equally impos|sible.</P>
<P>3. They say that the substance of
Bread and Wine is avoided, and that on|ly
the accidents remain; so that there is
length and nothing long, breadth and no|thing
broad, thickness and nothing thick,
whiteness and nothing white, moisture
and nothing moist, sweetness and nothing
sweet, that is, a long, broad, thick,
white, moist, sweet nothing. The Priest
pours out nothing but Lines and Colours,
when he pours out the Wine, for these
accidents of Bread and Wine are not in
the Bread, because that is avoided and
vanisht, and they are not in the Body of
Christ, as themselves say, and yet it is
plain this Bread and Wine do nourish the
Body, and is the Body nourished by meer
accidents? Can there be plainer contra|dictions?</P>
<P>4. Can the same Body at the same time
have his just Dimensions, distance of
parts, symmetry, proportion, as the Bo|dy
of Christ hath, and yet not have
these, because all parts? Yea, the whole
Body of Christ, say they, is in one and
the self same point or crumb of Bread.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="114">5. Can the Body of Christ, which is
much greater, be wholly contained in a
Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er or piece of Bread, in his full Di|mensions,
and that as many times as
there are points, crumbs, drops in the
Bread or Wine?</P>
<P>6. Can the Bread be turned into the
very Body of Christ, and yet not any
thing of that Bread become any thing of
Christ, nor the matter, nor form, nor
accidents of Bread be made either the
matter, or form, or accidents of Christ?</P>
<P>7. Can the same thing, as Christs true
Body, at the same time be wholly above
it self, and wholly below it self, within
and without it self? Can it be moved,
and yet be still? be carried from one place
to another, and yet not move? be
brought from Heaven to Earth, and yet
not come out of Heaven? Who then can
assure us that when Christ hung upon the
Cross, he was not walking somewhere
else, Crucified and not Crucified, eaten
and not eaten, alive in one and dead in
another place?</P>
<P>8. What dishonour do these men ren|der
the Body of Christ obnoxious unto,
to be eaten by wicked men, by brute
Creatures, by Mice, by other vermine,
<PB N="211" REF="114">
to be cast into some unclean place? For
so long as the form of Bread remains, so
long the Body of Christ is there, though
it be in the Mouth or Belly of a Mouse,
saith <HI>Hales,</HI> and the rest of the School|men,
who do one where or another ac|knowledge
the most of these monstrous
Absurdities, and go about to heal, and
solve them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> We shall surcease from raking fur|ther
into the ingrateful sink, whose Name
Transubstantiation is but of yesterday in
comparison, and which dishonours the Body
of Christ, into a Monster, destroyes the na|ture
of a Sacrament, and fills the world with
dreadful Contentions and broils: And shall
now consider with our selves what may pro|fitably
be observed from all this: What
therefore may be observed upon the whole
matter?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We may observe, 1. What grievous
impositions the Romanists lay upon the
Faith of them that are devoted to her
Communion.</P>
<P>2. What contradictions and absurdities
the common people do ignorantly and
implicitly believe.</P>
<P>3. What strong delusions even to be|lieve
lies God gives up learned men unto,
<PB N="212" REF="115">
that refuse the simplicity of the truth for
interests and politick ends!</P>
<P>4. What a Mercy of God it is to de|liver
us from that Tyranny, which leaves
us no other choice, but to swallow and
digest such impossible things, or to be sa|crificed
in flames, and the Lord forbid
the Re-entrance of that Religion among
us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Vines</HI> on the Sa|crament.</NOTE> which in all likelihood will cost us
our Souls, or our Lives.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Since the worthy Receivers are not
after a corporal and carnal manner partakers
of Christs Body and Blood; After what
manner are they partakers of them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> How understand you that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As truly as the Minister gives them
the Bread and Wine, so truly doth God
give them the Body and Blood of Christ,
that is, the Crucified Saviour, not by
local motion, but by real communicati|on,
not to their teeth, but to their Souls;
and consequently exhibits to them all the
benefits thereof to their spiritual nou|rishment
and growth in Grace, and all
the advantages that flow to them from the
death of Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 97. What is required to the worthy
receiving of the Lords Supper?</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="115"><HI>A.</HI> It is required of them that would
worthily partake of the Lords Supper,
that they examine themselves of their
knowledge to discern the Lords Body,
of their Faith to feed upon him, of their
Repentance, Love and new Obedience:
lest coming unworthily, they eat and
drink Judgement to themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Explic. Q.</HI> How ought Christians to
partake of the Lords Supper?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought to partake worthily
(that is suitably) with a suitable frame
of heart to this Ordinance.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the great duty of those that
would thus partake?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is required that they examine
themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How many things must they examine
themselves about?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Five especially, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. Knowledge.
2. Faith. 3. Love. 4. Repentance.
5. New Obedience.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Must every one that cometh to the
Lords Supper have Knowledge?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> Why is Knowledge necessary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To discern the Lords Body<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 28, 29</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What other graces must they examine
themselves about?</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="116"><HI>A.</HI> Their Faith, Repentance and
Love.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In their examination, what must they
look after?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Two things especially; 1. That
they have these Graces. 2. That the
said Graces be in readiness for service and
exercise, that is, that they so stir up
these Graces of the Holy Ghost, as they
may be most profitably exerted in this
most Sacred solemn Ordinance.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why is Faith necessary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To feed on Christ. <HI>Iohn</HI> 6. 53.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why is Repentance necessary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Repentance for sin will fit them to
receive, and sweeten their receiving the
benefits of Christs death to their Souls.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why is Love necessary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because they who have no Love to
God and Christ, and their Brethren, are
unfit to receive the pledge of Gods Love
to themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What else must they examine them|selves
about?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> New Obedience, whether they
propose and practise it in any good mea|sure.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why is New Obedience necessary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because Christ only communicates

the benefits of his death to them that
obey him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Heb. 5. 9</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What if any Communicants shall eat
this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord
unworthily?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They shall be guilty of the Body
and Blood of Christ<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 27</NOTE>.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> All such Communicants eat and
drink Judgement to themselves<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">1 Cor&punc; 11. 29</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 98. What is Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Prayer is an offering up of our de|sires
to God for things agreeable to his
Will, in the Name of Christ, with con|fession
of our sins and thankful acknow|ledgement
of his mercies.</P>
<P><HI>Explic. Q.</HI> What are the parts of
Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Confession, Petition, and Thanks|giving.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> And how many things are there, as
the matter of these?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Three; our sins, as the matter of
our Confession; our desires and wants,
as the matter of our Petition; and our
Mercies as the matter of our Thanks|giving.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is Confession?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A due acknowledgement of our

sins with all their several aggravating cir|cumstances<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Dan. 9. 4, &amp;c. 2 Sam. 24. 10</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is Petition?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The offering up of our desires to
God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> To whom are we to direct our Prayers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To God only<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psa. 5. 2, 3</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why are we to direct our Prayers only
to God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Because Prayer is such a specia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
part of religious worship, that it is
sometimes in holy Writ put for the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Gen 4. 26 Acts 9. 14 Jer. 10. 25 Psal. 79. 6 and 116. 13 Gen. 12. 8</NOTE>

only object of religious worship<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Mat. 4. 10 Rev. 19. 10 and 22. 8, 9</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. Because God only is omniscient and
omnipresent to know our wants and hear
our Prayers. 1 <HI>Kings 8. 38, 39. Psal.</HI>
34. 15. <HI>Isa.</HI> 63. 16.</P>
<P>3. Because the Title of a Hearer of
Prayers is one of Gods Peculiars, and
that glory which he will not give to any
other<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Psal. 65. 2 Mat. 4. 10</NOTE>.</P>
<P>4. It is Paganism, and gross Idolatry
to give so principal a part of divine wor|ship,
and to do service to them that by
nature are no Gods. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4 8.</P>
<P>5. Because God only is Almighty and
can answer our Prayers, he is All-suffici|ent
and will fulfill all our Petitions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 6. 15 Psal. 145. 18, 19 and 20. 4, 5</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="117"><HI>Q.</HI> Are therefore forbidden to Pray to
Saints and Angels?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We are forbidden to Pray to them,
upon pain of Gods high displeasure, and
such punishments as he will inflict upon

known duty to him, by intruding into
those things which they have not seen.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> The Papists please themselves, and

as if there were some special humility in so
doing; Have they any ground for this

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> The Papists with one hand lay hold on
the Merits of Christ, but with the other
they lay hold on the Merits of Saints, and
Martyrs: Can they deny this?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They cannot deny it: For before
God and his Angels, their Priests, when
they sing Mass, Pray unto God, not only
through the Merits of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sus Christ, but
also through the Merits of Saints, whose
Reliques are under the Altar.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do not their Devotoes [the more
superstitiously devout Papists] publickly as|sert
that the holy Virgin saves us, and brings
us into heavenly glory, not only by her

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Doth not this Opinion of theirs border

<P><PB N="219" REF="118"><HI>Q.</HI> Are there not in <HI>Rome</HI> it self pub|lished

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Because none but Christ were

in us to imagine the Saints or Angels to

that honour they were never called unto

<P>2. Because he alone is able to save us
to the utmost; and seeing he ever liveth
to make Intercession for us (presenting
himself before God, and that one once
offered perfect Sacrifice for sin for us)
<PB N="220" REF="119">
we should much derogate from the suffici|ency

<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is Thanksgiving?</P>

praise that is due unto his Name<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Psal. 103. 1, 2 and 29. 1, 2 1 Thes. 5. 18 Phil. 4. 6</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 99. What rule hath God given for
our direction in Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The whole Word of God is of use
to direct us in Prayer; but the special
rule of Direction is that Form of Prayer
which Christ taught his Disciples, com|monly
called the Lords Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>Explic. Q.</HI> What is generally useful for

<P><HI>A.</HI> The whole Word of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But have we not left us upon Record,
some special rule for our direction in Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, the Lords Prayer. <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.
<HI>Luke</HI> 11.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why is that Form recorded in the
Gospels, called the Lords Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because the Lord Jesus taught it his
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sciples. <HI>Luke</HI> 11. 1, 2.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what use is the Lords Prayer?</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="119"><HI>A.</HI> To direct us in Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is it only of use to direct us in
Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is not the saying the very words of
the Lords Prayer commended unto us, if not
commanded?</P>
<P>A. <HI>Yes,</HI> Luke [Chap. 11. 2.] <HI>hath
it,</HI> When ye Pray, say, Our Father, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Q. What kind of Forms may our Prayers
be presented in?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Either in set or extemporary un|prescribed
Forms.</P>
<P>Q. Are set Forms of Prayer lawful?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Set Forms of Prayer are lawful,
both as the word [Set] signifies pre|meditate
limited Forms, as opposed to
extemporary; and as it signifies pre|scribed,
and for some occasions and uses
commanded.</P>
<P>Q. How do you prove it lawful to use a
set determinate Form of words, either writ|ten
or fastened in our memory?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is apparent both by the example
of Christ, who in St. <HI>Luke</HI> bids us, when
we pray, say, <HI>Our Father,</HI> &amp;c. (Not
only pray after this Pattern, as the words
in St. <HI>Matthew</HI> may be interpreted, but
use these very words, <HI>When you pray,

of <HI>Iohn</HI> Baptist, who taught his Disci|ples
to pray in some Form, though we
know not what it is, <HI>Luke</HI> 11. 1. As also
of the Priests under the Law, by Gods
appointment, that used a Set Form of
blessing the People, <HI>Numb. 6. 24, &amp;c.</HI>
And of our Saviour himself, who used a
a part (if not the whole) of the 22.
<HI>Psalm</HI> upon the Cross, <HI>My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me,</HI> &amp;c. And of
the Church of the Jews, and Christian
Churches through all times, who have
had their Liturgies, as waies and Forms
of serving God publickly, and as means
to preserve the true Religion from all cor|ruptions
in Doctrine. And to these Argu|ments
may be aded one more of common
observation, that even when the Minister
(or whosoever is the mouth of the rest)
prayeth, though in a Form of his own
present extemporary effusion, yet at that
time all others present are limited to his
conceptions, and pray in as stinted a Form,
as if what the Minister prays were read
out of a Book, or dictated by his Me|mory.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But how do you prove it lawful to use a
Set (as that signifies a prescribed) Form of
Prayer?</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="120"><HI>A.</HI> It is apparent, 1. By Christs pre|scribing
one, which he would not sure
have done, if it had not been lawful to
have used it being prescribed; and so
also, 2. By the other examples mention|ed,
which are most of them prescripti|ons.
3. By the no Objection against the
use of them; For sure, if it be lawful to
use them, it is lawful to prescribe them at
some time, and for some uses, (for that
a thing in it self acknowledged, and
proved to be lawful, should by being
commanded by lawful Authority become
unlawful, is very unreasonable, unless
lawful Magistrates be the only unlawful
things) and at other times to use other
liberty is not forbidden, and so hereby
there is not any invasion or Tyranny used
upon our Christian liberty. 4. By the
great benefit that accrues to the Congre|gation
in having discreet well formed
Prayers, and so not subject to the tem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|rity
and impertinences of the sudden effu|sions;
and the same still in constant use,
and so not strange or new to them, but
such as in which they may with under|standing
go along with the Minister, and
by the help of their Memory the most ig|norant
may carry them away for his pri|vate

use, and generally those that want
such helps, are by this means afforded
them. And lastly, by the consideration
of this one special farther advantage of
them, <HI>viz.</HI> that by means of prescribed
Liturgies the Unity of Faith, and Cha|rity
is much preserved.</P>
<P>Q Well then, supposing these Set Forms
to be lawful in themselves, and lawful to
be prescribed; whether may any other be
used but such?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea doubtless:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>H's</HI> practical Catechism, <HI>p.</HI> 239.</NOTE> For the Church be|ing
obeyed in the observance of the pre|scribed
Liturgy in publick, permits some|times
(and upon special incidental oc|casions
prescribes) other Forms in the
publick Congregation, so it be done pru|dently,
and piously, and reverently, and
to Edification; and so also in the Family,
or in visitation of the sick, if the parti|cular
condition of one or other do require
it: and in private, in the Closet, it is
not supposed by the Church of <HI>England</HI>
but that every one may ask his own wants
in what form of words he shall think fit;
which that he may do fitly and reverently,
it will not be amiss for him to acquaint
himself with the several addresses to God,
which the Book of <HI>Psalms,</HI> and other
<PB N="225" REF="121">
parts of holy Writ, and all other helps of
devotion will afford him, either to use as
he finds them fit for the present purpose,
or by those patterns to direct and prepare
himself to do the like.</P>

dead and departed out of this life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Because we find not any com|mand
or example in the Scripture, that
Prayers are to be made for souls departed;
but have the example of <HI>David</HI> (that
man after Gods own heart) against it.</P>
<P>2. The souls of the righteous in Hea|ven
stand in no need of our Prayers,
and the souls of the wicked in Hell can
receive no good by them, or by the pre|tended
sacrifice of the Mass.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But where are those souls pretended to
be, that are thought, by the Papists, to be
profited by their Prayers, and their sacrifice
of the Mass?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In Purgatory.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> If then there be no Purgatory, do
not the Papists themselves grant it us, that
there are no Prayers to be made for the
Dead?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What souls do the Papists tell us must
go to Purgatory?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They tell us that the souls of the
impenitent do not go to Purgatory, but
<PB N="228" REF="123">
to Hell, nor the souls of all Believers,
but of some only, <HI>viz.</HI> of those that did
not fully satisfie for their sins in this
life.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What kind of place do they imagine
Purgatory to be?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A place of great pain, where the
fore-mentioned souls are tormented till
they satisfie Gods Justice, and then being
purged fully from sin, they are to be re|ceived
up into Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What difference do they make be|twixt
Hell and Purgatory?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They say in Purgatory, the fore-mentioned
souls suffer the vengeance of
a temporary fire, but in Hell impenitent
Unbelievers suffer the vengeance of eter|nal
fire.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> The Papists profess to believe with us,
That the blood of Iesus Christ purgeth and
cleanseth us from all our sins: Why then
have they invent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d the fire of Purgatory?
If all sins are washed away, and purged by
the blood of Christ, what then remains to be
purged in this imaginary fire?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They mock the world in calling it
Purgatory, for (according to the Romish
Doctrine) it serves not to purge, but to
punish souls, and to satisfie Gods Justice;
<PB N="229" REF="123">
so that it is not a purging, but a pain and
a punishment.</P>
<P><HI>Q&punc;</HI> But can the sufferings of the fore-mentioned
Believers in Purgatory, satisfie
Gods offended Iustice, so that by the help of
the Prayers of the living&punc; and the sacrifice
of the Mass, they shall be delivered thence,
and accounted worthy to be received up into
Heaven?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 'Tis impossible that the sufferings
of finite and mutable Creatures, which
are but of yesterday, should satisfie the
offended Justice of the infinite, eternal
and unchangeable God: And that their
temporary torments, though never so ex|quisite,
should merit for them that far
more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory, which all shall be partakers of, that
are received up into Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How may it be proved that we are
delivered from the whole punishment of
sin, temporal and Eternal, by the death of
Christ: So that we shall not need to fear
their fear, who through fear of Purga|tory-fire,
are all their life-time subject to
bondage; or be affrighted with their big
words, who are so hot for this invented
fire, as to say, Whosoever believeth not Pur|gatory
shall be tormented in Hell?</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> And is not this new invented doctrine
<PB N="231" REF="124">
of Purgatory contrary to the intendment and
design of the Gospel?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, for the design of the Gospel
is to comfort Believers against all their
sufferings in this life, with the hope of hea|venly
glory and happiness, to be enjoyed
immediately after their death; see <HI>Rom.
15. 4. Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 5. 24. 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2. 1 Thes.

Luke</HI> 23. 43. and 16. 22, 23. with <HI>Mat.
8. 11, 12. Heb.</HI> 11. 13, 16. But this
new invented Doctrine speaks terrour to
all Believers, as being so far from making
God full satisfaction for their sins in this
life (as some of them are supposed to do
by the Papists) that they were never able
to make God any satisfaction for them.
And therefore must we certainly be all
doomed alike to go to Purgatory, that
place of so great pain, that the most
torturing wheels, and the most ardent
fires are nothing in comparison of it, if
it be true (which those of that party
say) that it is ten times hotter than our
fire, and that it differs from Hell-fire,
in respect of duration only.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> And will not such Doctrine as this be
a great scandal, and a Rock of offence to
weak Believers, for whom Christ died?</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="125"><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But is it not the duty of every one
that nameth the name of Christ, to com|fort
the feeble-minded, and to support the
weak?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Q. And do not they blaspheme that
wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hy n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">me, by the which they are called,
that break a bruised Reed, and quench the
smoaking Flax?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Q. And whoever shall offend one of these
little ones which believe in Christ; were
it not better for him that a Millstone were
hanged about his neck, and that he were
drowned in the depth of the Sea?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Q Now therefore, seeing we know these
things before, should we not beware lest we
also being led away with the error of the
wicked, fall from our own stedfastness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Q. But that we may not as Children be
tossed to and fro, and carried about with
every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of
men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they
lie in wait to deceive; 'Twill highly con|cern
us to be much in reading the Scriptures,
and to use all possible means to help us to
<PB N="233" REF="125">
understand the reading, because there are
some things in them hard to be understood,
which our Adversaries, the learned of them
especially, do wrest for their confirmation of
the doctrine of Purgatory, as of their other
inventions?</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. The Papists glory much in
1 Cor. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Read it;
Doth this place rightly understood confirm
their Doctrine of Purgatory fire?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, for if the design of the Apo|stle
be attended unto in this place, we
may with more reason call the unlevened
bread eaten in the Land of Promise by the
<HI>Israelites,</HI> the very identical bread of
affliction really eaten by their Fathers in
<HI>Egypt,</HI> as it was a sign of it; than the
fire here mentioned by the Apostle, their
material Purgatory fire, which is no sign
of any such fond invention.</P>
<P>Q. What therefore is the true sense
and meaning of this place?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If the scope of the place be ob|served,
we shall easily see the meaning of
the place to be nothing but this, <HI>viz.</HI>
That the Faith of Christ being the Foun|dation
which our Apostle had laid, and
indeed the only one which could possibly
be laid: That that which was regularly
<PB N="234" REF="126">
to be built thereon was constant confes|sion
of Christ in despire of affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions,
which like Gold and Silver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would

with the Persecutors, Jews or
Gentiles, If any such earthly material
were brought in the stead of the formen|tioned
constancy, it should be brought
suddenly to the trial; And proving com|bustible
matter, it will not bear that trial
(such are the Doctrines of denying Christ
when persecuted) and it shall be so far
from helping this Gnostick complier to
any advantage as the hopes it will, that it
shall bring the greatest danger upon him;
and if upon timely Repentance, or by
his not having actually denyed Christ
(for all his superstructing of some erro|neous
doctrines) he be more mercifully
dealt with by Christ, and freed from
having his portion with Unbelievers,
yet it shall go hard with him, as with one
that is involved in a common fire, and
hardly escapes out of it.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. They urge also, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 19.
By which also he went and Preached unto
the Spirits in Prison; Do you think when
<PB N="235" REF="126">
this Scripture is rightly considered it will
justifie their Opinion of Purgatory fire?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No&punc; 1. Because the Apostle saith
that these Spirits that be in Prison, were
disobedient in the daies of <HI>Noah, vers.</HI> 20.
And the Papists themselves hold, that
disobedient and impenitent persons go to
Hell, but the Souls of Believers only to
Purgatory; so that this place is nothing
at all for Purgatory.</P>
<P>2. Because Christ is not said to Preach
in the Prison to the Spirits, but to the
Spirits in Prison: The difference be|twixt
these two expressions is very great;
He preached to them in the daies of <HI>Noah,</HI>
who were in Prison in the daies of the
Apostles: He Preached to them out of
Prison, that are now in Prison; which
is nothing to their purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. Mat. 12. 32. Whosoever
speaketh a word against the Son of man,
it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speak|eth
against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiven him, neither in this world, nei|ther
in the world to come; Hence they argue
that some sins shall be forgiven in the world
to come.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not to be forgiven in this world,
nor in the world to come, is as much as,
<PB N="236" REF="127">
shall never be forgiven; so <HI>Matthew</HI> ex|plains
himself, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 31. And so
<HI>Mark</HI> doth express it, <HI>Mark</HI> 3. 29. Read
the places.</P>
<P><HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ject.</HI> 4. They urge <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 25, 26.
read the place. This Prison, saith <HI>Bellar|mine,</HI>
is Purgatory, out of which, after
the Debt is paid, the Debtor shall go
forth?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Some understand the place lite|rally,
and if it be so understood, it is
altogether impertinent to the matter in
hand.</P>
<P>2. If the place be taken in a spiritual
sense, by the Prison must necessarily be
understood Hell (and not Purgatory)
whence the Debtor shall never come
forth, because no meer man by his suf|fering
can in a finite time satisfie the in|finite
offended Justice of God.</P>
<P>3. And that which may be an argu|ment
to them, they interpret other Scrip|tures
where they meet with the like
phrases in the same sense we understand
this very place; see <HI>Mat. 1. 25. Gen. 8. 7.
Deut. 34. 6. 1 Sam.</HI> 15. 35. and 2 <HI>Sam.</HI>
6. 23. So that in brief, in the literal
sense, it is impertinent, and in the spi|ritual
sense it must needs be understood
<PB N="237" REF="127">
of Hell, whence there is no Redempti|on.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How many sorts of Prayers are

<P><HI>A.</HI> Three, <HI>viz.</HI> Closet, Family and
Publick.</P>
<P>Q What do you mean by Closet-Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Entring into our Closet alone, and
praying unto our Father in secret.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why is Closet-Prayer necessary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because those that pray after the
manner of Hypocrites, to be seen of men,
have their reward: But if, we pray to the
Father in secret, our Father which seeth
in secret, shall reward us openly<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Mat. 6. 5, 6</NOTE></P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Mat. 6 5, 6 with <HI>vers</HI> 9</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When you say you are to pray for
others, what do you mean by it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That we ought to pray for all in
the Land of the living (which is the
only Land of hope) yea, though they
be the greatest sinners, and such Prisoners
as are bound with the bands and setters
of their sins; they are Prisoners of
hope, if they have not sinned the sin unto
death; and we ought to pray for them.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="128"><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean by Family-Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Praying in and with our Families
for our selves and others.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why ought we to pray in our Fa|milies?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because God will pour out his fury
upon the Families that call not on his

<P><HI>Q.</HI> What mean you by Publick-Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Praying in and with the publick
Assemblies for our selves and others.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Ought not publick prayer to be pre|ferred
above all Family-private-prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, because every particular Be|liever
hath special interest and power
with God, and doth prevail with him
for all desireable blessings; and a multi|tude
of Believers assembled together in
publick, will have a greater interest and
power with God in Prayer, than a few
met together in a private Family: And
therefore publick-prayer ought to be and
will be preferred by all that regard their
own interest, above any Family-private-prayer
whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="128"><HI>Q.</HI> Whom doth the Preface of the Lords
Prayer teach us to pray unto?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To our Father who is in Heaven.</P>

our reverence to him, and our Faith in

<P><HI>Q.</HI> But when mention is made of the

<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> How and in what order are we to di|rect
our Prayers to the persons of the blessed
Trinity? And whether may we not single
out any one of the Persons, to whom we
may direct more immediately such or such
a Prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The case hath so much difficulty in
it, that a short answer must not be ex|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cted
to so great questions, as are
couched in it; yet we will endeavour to
give an answer thereunto, as briefly as
we can in these following Conclusions:
Some of which will be of use to us as
rules of direction to lead us into the
sound knowledge of these and other
mysteries of the Gospel.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="129">1. That in all parts of divine worship,
and so in this of Prayer, the Trinity in
Unity, and Unity in Trinity is to be
worshipped and respected. Or, That
we ought so to think of God in Prayer
as one in Essence, yet three in Persons:
and so as three in Persons, that he is but
one in Essence.</P>
<P>2. That we ought so to think in Prayer
of some one Person in the Trinity, as
thereby to be led to the other two: The
Father being in the Son, and the Son in
the Father, and the Holy Ghost in them
both<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Joh. 14. 9, 10, 16, 17 and 15. 26 Isa. 48. 16</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. That in order, we are first to di|rect
our Prayers to the blessed Father;
yet not as first, or chief in honour and
dignity above the other two, but as first
in order of subsisting: according as the
Scripture in two places, where the order
of the blessed Persons is set down, the
Father is first set down in order of wit|nessing,
1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5. 7. and invocation and
worship, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19.</P>
<P>4. In singling out any one Person in
the blessed Trinity, we are to pitch most
usually on the Father, as he to whom we
direct our Prayers through the mediation
of Christ, and by the help of the Holy
<PB N="241" REF="129">
Ghost: That is the Rule and method
prescribed by Christ, to ask the Father in
his Name, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 16. 23. and suitable is
and hath been the usual practice of the
Saints: And yet in such directings of
Prayers most what as to the Father in the
general intention of their Spirits, do the
Saints mind and eye the other two Per|sons,
and include them as joyntly wor|shipped;
and therefore in their Prefaces
of Prayer they do oftimes mention ex|presly,
that blessed God one in Essence,
yet three in Persons, as he to whom they
speak; and in the close they subscribe
glory to the blessed Father, Son and Spi|rit,
three Persons yet one God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>5. We may single out the Son of God,
the Lord Jesus Christ, as he to whom we
occasionally present some special request,
either by way of Apostrophe, whilst we
are directing our Prayers to the Father,
or in way of Ej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">culation: as did <HI>Stephen,
Acts 7. 59. Lord Iesus receive my Spirit.</HI>
And so in the instance of that short
prayer of the Converted Thief, <HI>Luke</HI>
23. 42. <HI>Lord, remember me when thou
comest into thy Kingdom;</HI> and so in that
short Prayer of <HI>Iacob</HI>'s, <HI>The Angel which
redeemed me from all evil, bless the Lads,
<PB N="242" REF="130">
Gen.</HI> 48. 16. this Angel was Christ:
And in more continued and solemn man|ner
did <HI>Abraham</HI> pray to that Angel,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 18. To him did <HI>Iacob</HI> pray again,
and make supplication, by the space al|most
of the whole night, and had power
over him, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32. from Verse 24. to
the end, compared with <HI>Hos.</HI> 12. 3, 4.
And the Reasons hereof are evident,</P>
<P>1. Because Prayer is a divine worship
of God as God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Acts 5. 4</NOTE>; and therefore due to
the Son, and so to the Holy Ghost as well
as to the Father. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 13, 14.</P>
<P>2. We are Baptized into the Name of
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, as well as
into the Name of the Father: and there|fore
both the Son and the Holy Ghost
may be particularly and personally invo|cated,
and worshipped as well as the
Father<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Joh. 14. 1</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. We are to believe in the Son, and
so in the Holy Ghost as well as in the
Father, and that personally and particu|larly:
and therefore so are to pray to ei|ther.
That which the Apostle expound|eth
of the Gentiles trusting in Christ,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 15. 12. the Prophet expressed of
their seeking to him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 11. 10. So that
they are inseparably due to one and the
<PB N="243" REF="130">
same Christ, upon one and the same
ground; see <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 13, 14. before
mentioned. It is supposed that he on
whom men call, he must be believed on,
or else he cannot be called upon by any;
and when the Apostle in the 13. Verse,
mentions the Name of the Lord, as that
which is called upon, he in Verse 14.
expounds it to be meant of the Lord
himself: to call upon the Lords Name,
is to call upon himself.</P>
<P>4. The Lord Jesus promiseth that he
will do what we ask, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 16. 23, 24.
and therefore he may be sought to do the
same; and indeed he proveth himself to
be equal with the Father by this argu|ment,
because Petitions shall not only be
granted in his Name, but by him: Nei|ther
doth he make account that this is any
disparagement to the Father, but a glori|fying
of him, and therefore when he
saith, <HI>Iob. 17. 1. Father glorifie thy Son,</HI>
he immediately adds, <HI>that thy Son also
may glorifie thee.</HI> What is said to prove
that in our Prayers we may single out the
Son of God, may serve to prove the
same may be done to the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> Against this which hath been said, it
may be objected, we are to ask all we do ask in
<PB N="244" REF="131">
the Name of Christ; and therefore how can
we be said to ask him, or Pray to him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. The Lord Jesus Christ is asked
or prayed unto in that prayer that is put
up to the Father in his Name, <HI>Iob.</HI> 16 23.
Christ speaking of the time after his Re|surrection
and Ascension, saith, <HI>In that
day ye shall ask me nothing:</HI> or (which
is all one) <HI>Verily, ye shall ask the Fa|ther
nothing in my Name, but be will give
it you.</HI> He is glorified as God, in that
all is done with God in his Name, and
for his Father. For albeit it be some|times
said, For <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>David</HI>'s
sake God will do this or that; yet this
is meant in reference to Gods Covenant
of Grace with them, and so to Christ
properly, in whom that Covenant is ra|tified,
<HI>Gal. 3. 17. They called on the
Name of the Lord Iesus Christ in every
place,</HI> 1 Cor. 1. 2. Yet surely they brake
not that Rule, <HI>Iob.</HI> 16. 23. They called
on the Father in Christs Name, even in
their calling upon God in his Name:
and Christ as God is also called upon,
in that his Father as God is called
upon.</P>
<P>2. In all external worship of God,
one Person of the Trinity being Named,
<PB N="245" REF="131">
the other are understood, and are not to
be excluded: the Trinity being undi|vided
in worship.</P>
<P>3. If Christ be considered as the Son
of God in Essence with the Father, He
is he to whom we come, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Coming
in Prayer to the Father: If considered as
Mediator, God incarnate, God and Man,
He is he by whom we come to the Father,
<HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 25. and 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 5. As the Son
of God, He may be, he must be prayed
to, which is God and Man in one Person;
but is not prayed to as Man, but as
God.</P>

<P>Some few Rules for the better under|standing,
and our more profitable read|ing
the holy Scriptures: And these are
either Antecedent, Concomitant, or Sub|sequent.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>1. Antecedent Rules.</HEAD>
<P>1. We must pray and beg of God wis|dom
to understand the Scriptures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 1. 5 Psa. 119. 18</NOTE> We
must pray with <HI>David,</HI> that God would
open our eyes, that we may behold won|drous
things out of his Law. We must
pray that God would acquaint us with
the mysterie of the Gospel; For if the
<PB N="267" REF="142">
Gospel be hid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4. 7</NOTE> it is hid to those that are
lost.</P>
<P>2. We must lay aside all vain conceit of
our own wisdom, be humble and hearken
to God alone, speaking in the Scriptur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s.
God hath so disposed the way to Heaven,
that the most ignorant and most humble,
not the most illuminate and most proud,
shall be most ready to receive and em|brace
the Gospel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 11. 25</NOTE></P>
<P>And we must account our own wisdom
foolishness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> that we may know the holy
Scriptures, which are able to make us
wise unto Salvation. We must lie low in
the fight and sense of our own ignorance,
arguing thus with our selves; Have we
lived so long, and read the Scriptures so
often, and know so little of them! Let
us thus be wail our ignorance, for the hum|ble
God will teach. The rain falls upon
the Rock, but rests not there, that it
may make the Valleys fruitful: Divine
heavenly wisdom will not rest upon a
proud heart, but will enrich the lowly
with its treasures.</P>
<P>We must hearken to God alone, speak|ing
in the Scriptures. <HI>Humanum est er|rare,</HI>
there is no infallible Judge upon
Earth. If any man Preach any other Do|ctrine
<PB N="268" REF="143">
unto us, than that we have received
from the Canonical Scriptures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l. 1. 9</NOTE> let him
be accursed. If Pope or Council, or Pope
and General Council agreeing together, de|cree
or determine any thing against or be|sides
the holy Scriptures; Let God be
True, and every man a Lyar, in this case
we are not to attend to a Thus faith a Fa|ther,
or a Pope, or Council, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to
a Thus saith the Lord.</P>
<P>3. We must go to the Scriptures with|out
prejudice. <HI>Non re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">erendus est sensus,
sed auferendus;</HI> We must not bring but
take our sense from the Scriptures; lest
we wrest them to our own destruction.
Take care no body plunder you, rob you
of all that you have, your principles of
Christian knowledge through Philosophy,
or by such vain, empty, frothy, pre|tended
knowledge and wisdom which the
Gnosticks of old talked so much of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 2. 8</NOTE> taken
out of <HI>Pythagoras;</HI> together with the ob|servances
of the Mosaical Law, and very
distant and contrary to Christian Divinity.</P>
<P>4. We must go to the Scriptures with
a mind purified by Faith and Repentance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 1. 15 2 Tim. 3. 8 Jam. 1. 21 Isa. 55 1, 2, 3</NOTE>
and in which is the study of Piety. We
must lay aside all filthiness and superfluity
or naughtiness when we go to the waters
of life.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="143">5. We must go with reverence and love
of the truth. We must go with reve|rence
to the holy Scriptures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thes&punc; 2 13&punc;</NOTE> because of
their Author and matter. We must go to
the Scriptures as to the Oracles of God
and the Laws of Heaven; the which we
must stand in awe of, and be subject to
for Conscience sake. We must go with
the love of the truth although it be against
flesh and blood, and thwart and contra|dict
self and carnal interest in the world.
The want of this love of the truth, is
given as the reason of that fatal miscarri|age
of the Gnosticks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thes. 2 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">0</NOTE> those carnal Chri|stians.</P>
<P>6. We must go to the Scriptures with
full purpose of heart to do the Will of
God, <HI>Ioh. 7. 17. 2 Tit. 11. 12. Luk. 11. 28.
The fear of the Lord is a step to wisdom,</HI>

<HEAD>2. Concomitant Rules.</HEAD>
<P>1. <HI>Non est recedendum &agrave; litera legis abs&abque;
summa necessitate.</HI> When the words of
Scripture may, without any incommodi|ty
or incongrui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y, be taken properly, and

Tropes, or improper senses, unless when
out of the words taken properly some
absurd interpretations should from thence
be elicited, <HI>Aug.</HI> Hence it follows that
they are the best Interpreters, who most
promptly and apertly manifest the native
and genuine sense. In which part with|out
boasting it may be said that the Pro|testants
exceed the Papists&punc; and carry
away the Palm: Because their Interpre|ters
are wont <GAP DESC="foreign">, as <HI>Oc|cumenius</HI>
saith in <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. to evert the pro|priety
of speech, and to turn all things
into the uncertain conjectures of Allego|ries.
That what <HI>Epiphanius</HI> in <HI>Nicolaitis</HI>
said of <HI>Origen,</HI> we may say of them,
<GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Allegorice expli|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t
quicquid potest;</HI> He allegorized what|soever
he could. Indeed it is said that he
interpreted literally <HI>Matthew</HI> 19. 12. and
in the same sense became an Eunuch him|self:
And so the Papists in like manner
interpret mostly in the Allegorie, excep|ting
that known place, <HI>This is my Body,</HI>
with a far greater and more dangerous
mistake than that of <HI>Origen</HI>'s, of that kind
of Eunuchs.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="144">But this Head is too general to be laid
down without some necessary cautions:
Take these few,</P>
<P>1. Augustini Regula tenenda est, <HI>lib.</HI> 3.
de doctrina Christiana, <HI>Cap. 5, 10, and</HI> 11.
Cavendum est n&egrave; figuratam locutionem ad

propria in figuratum sensum torqueatur.
<HI>Let's take heed of taking figures literally,
and of wresting the proper sense into fi|gures.</HI></P>
<P>2. It is to be supposed that some places
of Scripture are true, both in the Type
and Antitype, both in the literal and
mystical sense. And, <HI>Verba sacrae Scrip|turae
sunt praegnantia, pariunt gemellos &amp;
sensum geminum admittunt.</HI> The words
of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cred Writ are pregnant with matter,
very fruitful, and sometimes bear twins
and admit a double sense: And 'tis an
unerring Rule in Divinity; Scripture is
alwaies to be expounded in the largest
sense; unless there be in or about the Text
some particular restriction to limit it;
and thus those words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 109 8 and Acts 1 20.</NOTE> <HI>Let another take
his Office,</HI> are true both of <HI>Doeg</HI> and
<HI>Iudas.</HI></P>
<P>3. It is to be observed, that in Prophe|cies
some particulars agree to the Type,
<PB N="272" REF="145">
and not to the Truth; some to the Truth,
and not to the Type; or to the Type in
one sense, to the Truth in another. Take
this Head because somewhat large in its
particular branches.</P>
<P>1. Some particulars agree to the Type
and not to the Truth. <HI>Psal.</HI> 40. 12.</P>
<P>2. Some to the Truth, and not to the
Type. <HI>Psal.</HI> 16. 10. with <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 29.
and 13. 35, 36, 37.</P>
<P>3. Or to the Type in one sense, and to
the Truth in another. So in those <HI>Psalms</HI>
wherein <HI>David</HI> is a Type of Christ: As
<HI>Psal.</HI> 2. and 16. and 22. and those in
which <HI>Solomon;</HI> as <HI>psal.</HI> 45. and 72.
Some things are spoken that must of ne|cessity
be understood of them in one No|tion;
of Christ in another. Of <HI>Pha|raoh</HI>'s
Daughter espoused to <HI>Solomon;</HI>
and the Church to Christ; the one typi|fied
by the other, <HI>Psal.</HI> 45. the same
may be said. <HI>Gatak.</HI> in <HI>Isa.</HI> 42.</P>
<P>But how may we know when we are
to interpret in the literal, and when in
the mystical sense?</P>
<P>These three Rules will in some mea|sure
direct us.</P>
<P>1. The first is <HI>Augustines</HI> golden Rule,
<HI>Si praeceptiva locutio est aut flagitium aut
<PB N="273" REF="145">
facinus vetans,</HI> &amp;c. If it be a precept for|bidding
any lewdness, or commanding
something profitable or beneficial, there
is no figure in the words, <HI>Take, eat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 24, 25</NOTE>
<HI>this do in remembrance of me. This do ye,
as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</HI>
Indeed, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> &amp;c. cannot be
taken in the literal sense, for the reasons
to be mentioned afterwards; But <HI>take,
eat,</HI> &amp;c. because a preceptive speech,
and commanding a necessary profitable
duty, and I am afraid a much neglected
duty too, we are not to suppose a figure
in the words. If there be sins of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Plura sunt peccata pri|vativa quam posi|tiva.</NOTE> Omission,
as without controversie there are; then
those who have not communicated in this
Ordinance, or not frequently, cannot but
be found guilty of a dangerous sinful neg|lect.
Nothing but ignorance and Pha|naticism
in the most proper and literal
sense can turn this divine precept into an
Allegory. Some are so fond as to think
that this Precept imports no more than
feeding upon Christ out of and in con|tempt
of this Sacrament: Such self-con|ceited
Gnosticks cannot rationally expect
the Churches welcom, <HI>Eat O Friends,
drink, yea drink abundantly, O be|loved.</HI>
And if ever such Spiritualists
<PB N="274" REF="146">
were really fed by Christ, they were no
doubt better fed than taught. But if
any man seem to be contentious, we
have not so learned Christ, neither the
Churches of God.</P>
<P>2. When the Text taken properly af|fords
a fit sense, nor doth ought appear
in the Context, or other places collated
that may cross it, it is not safe running
into metaphorical senses. And thus we
understand those Buyers and Sellers,
whom our Saviour cast out of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m|ple,
<HI>Mat.</HI> 21. 12. in the Letter, and not
in the Allegory; although some Novel|lists
of our times, giving way to their
own luxuriant fancies, have turned this,
and all the History of the Gospel into a
mysterie, or rather a groundless conceit
of their own brains.</P>
<P>3. Indeed when the words taken in
the Letter are absurd and contradictory
to sense and reason, we must of necessity
apply our selves to the figurate sense.
And surely he is bruitish and hath not
the understanding of a man, that will
Interpret against all sense and reason.
Reason doth not contradict sense, nor
Faith reason, but only correct them when
they exercise themselves in great matters,
<PB N="275" REF="146">
and in things too high for them, and
beyond their Sphear: And 'tis fit that
sense should give place to reason, and
reason to Faith; as it did in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s
case, who, <HI>Rom</HI> 4. 18. [against Hope,
or rather beyond Hope] (as the words
may be better rendred) <HI>i. e.</HI> above all
causes, arguments and appearances of
natural Hope, such as reason and humane
understanding could afford or reach to
[believed in Hope] <HI>i. e.</HI> in Hope ground|ed
upon the truth and power of God.
For although there be in Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 3. 16</NOTE>
<GAP DESC="foreign">, some things hard to be un|derstood,
yet there is nothing in it re|pugnant
to right reason. Although in
this life and imperfect state, we see
<GAP DESC="foreign">, through a glass
darkly, and do know <GAP DESC="foreign">, but in
part; And, <HI>Quoad nos,</HI> there may not
alwaies be <HI>ratio rei (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">creditae</HI>) yet there
is alwaies <HI>ratio credendi;</HI> Because infinite
wisdom cannot be deceived, and infinite
goodness will not deceive. And accord|ing
to the forementioned Rules, we may
be satisfied against the Papists literal in|terpretation
of that known place, <HI>This
is my Body.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="147">1. Because the letter is contrary and
repugnant to our senses; which the
Scripture it self intimates to be of infal|lible
certainty.</P>
<P>2. It is absurd and contradictive of
right reason.</P>
<P>3. There appears much in the context
to cross it, nothing at all to countenance
it.</P>
<P>4. Because other places collated, ex|presly
thwart and contradict it.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Rule.</HI> Let the fuller Scripture make
out the shorter. We must compare the
shorter place with the larger, <HI>i. e.</HI> the
place that speaks but briefly of a thing,
with some other that speaks of it more
at large, common observation tells us,
that 'tis not the right method to read ab|stracts
first; because though they be fuller
of matter, they are fuller likewise of
obscurity. And sometimes that of the
learned <HI>Bacon</HI> proves true, That Epito|mes
are the corruptions and moths of
Histories. Epitomes give us the substance
of a matter; but full Narratives must
clear it up to us, with all its due circum|stances.
A compendium gives us the
Quintessence; Vertue, Force and Spirit
of a thing; but the History at large is
<PB N="277" REF="147">
necessary to the right understanding of it.</P>
<P>3. Let the clearer Scripture clear the
obscurer. We must compare the ob|scurer
with the clearer, <HI>i. e.</HI> if any
place occur which is more obscure, but
elsewhere propounded to us in words
that are more clear; we must have re|course
to it to clucid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">te the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ormer. We
must compare <HI>Moses</HI> with the Prophets:
Of all the Prophets <HI>Esaias</HI> speaks most
clearly, who is therefore stiled the Evan|gelical
Prophet, and seems rather to
write the History than the Prophecie of
Christ. We must compare the Old Te|stament
with the New: In the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">w
Testament the Book of the Revelations
is deemed (by those Interpreters that
are wise unto sobriety, and not above
what is written) to stand in most need
of interpretation by the other written
Revelations. The Sacred Scriptures are
written very much historically; the Do|ctrines
being interspersed with the Histo|ry.
Some Eyangelists speak more clear|ly
than others; some most clearly of
one part of the History of Christ, some
of another; that all of them collated
(without conspiring together by a con|trived
design) might give us the com|pleat
<PB N="278" REF="148">
History of Christ. That you may
see the usefulness of this Rule, consult
<HI>Ioh.</HI> 16. 16, 17, 18. with 28, 29 <HI>verses</HI>
compared together.</P>
<P>4. Let that Scripture determine the
point that intends it. You must com|pare
Scripture with Scripture, and you
must compare them aright; compare the
place that speaks, <HI>ex casu,</HI> occasionally
of a matter, with some other, where it
is the main design of the place. This
Rule is to be attended unto in the Expo|sition
of Parables: For, if we be strict
observers of all by-passages in them; in|stead
of Milk, we shall wring till blood
cometh. We must remember that Alle|gories
must not be strained too much,
and that similitudes a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">swer not in all
Lines, but in the chiefest. Read for
this purpose <HI>Luke</HI> 16.</P>
<P>5. Out of the scope and intention of
the writer is often collected the sense of
his words. And the scope of the writer
may be guessed at by the following cir|cumstances,
<HI>viz. Quorsum, quibus, con|tra
quos, quae, ex cujus person&acirc;;</HI> Why,
to whom, against whom or what,
of whose p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rson, he writes, which
last circumstance clears most pas|sages,
<PB N="279" REF="148">
relating to the Eunuchs Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">esti|on.</P>
<P>6. Compare Antecedents and conse|quents
in the place, whose sense is dubi|ous,
and it will much conduce to the
right understanding of it. Where there
is not light enough in the Text, there
may be a light shining round about it,
in the Context, to enlighten it.</P>
<P>7. Negatives are more extensive than
affirmatives. <HI>Affirmativa non valent ubi|que
ad semper, negativa ubique;</HI> or thus,
<HI>Affi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mativa valent semper, negativa ad
semper.</HI> When God saith, <HI>Pray;</HI> it is
alwaies true, while in this prob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tion|sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e,
that we must pray; but it is not true
that we must pray alwaies, <HI>i.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> do nothing
but pray: But when 'tis said, <HI>Thou shalt,
not Kill,</HI> &amp;c. This is our duty at all times,
there is no time wherein 'tis lawful to
Kill, commit Adultery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>8. Let an exception straiten and nar|row
a general Rule.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 44 14, 27, 28 Mat. 19. 6 with 9.</NOTE> <HI>Exceptio firmat Re|gulam
in non exceptis, terminum praescribit
in exceptis.</HI> An exception confirms the
Rule in things not excepted, and bounds
it against the rest.</P>
<P>9. <HI>Non est distinguendum, ubi Lex
non distingui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> We must not distinguish
<PB N="280" REF="149">
where the Law doth not warrant it.
<HI>In Christ Iesus neither Circumcision avail|eth
any thing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 15</NOTE> <HI>nor uncircumcision, but a
new Creature.</HI> If this Rule be attended
unto, we shall easily understand how
nice the distinctions of Conformity and
non-conformity are, and how unavailable
either of them will be in attaining Salva|tion
for us without a reformed life.</P>
<P>10. We must carefully distinguish of
the Scripture, which speaks of the growth
of the Church, from that which speaks
of the infancy of it. And thus, as for
the Discipline of the Church of <HI>En|gland,</HI>
our <HI>English</HI> Reformers considered
what it was in the purest times of the
first good Christ an Emperours, when the
Church was in its growth: For the times
of Persecution in the infancy of the Church
(before temporal Princes embraced the
Christian Faith) as they were most ex|cellent
times for doctrine and manners;
so very unproper and unfit for a Pattern
or example of outward Government and
Policy. And doubtless, that Govern|ment
is most excellent, both in the com|munity
as Christian, and in the special
notion as reformed, that keepeth the
middle way between the Pomp of super|stitious
<PB N="281" REF="149">
Tyranny, and the meanness of
Phanatick Anarchy: And this can be no|thing
else, but a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">l regulated moderate
Episcopacy, according to this Rule.</P>
<P>11. That which the Scripture holds
forth at all times, must not be prejudiced
by what may take in one particular case:
although, <HI>Necessitas est jus temporis,</HI> Ne|cessity
be a Law in its time. This is a
Rule at all times, Borrow and pay again:
This must not be prejudiced by that of
the <HI>Israelites</HI> borrowing of the <HI>Egyptians.</HI>
This must not determine, <HI>Ehud</HI> destroyed
<HI>Eglon,</HI> therefore thou shalt kill, because 'tis
not safe arguing from particulars to gene|ral
duties.</P>
<P>12. Out of the Tradition and Inter|pretation
of the truly Catholick Church,
out of the consent of the Fathers; and
of these, either of many or of few of
them when eminent for sanctity or learn|ing;
out of the unanimous conspiration
of Doctors and Interpreters, the true
and literal sense of Holy Writ may be
often cleared up unto us.</P>
<P>By universal Tradition is meant, <HI>Quod
ab omnibus, quod ubique, quod semper re|ceptum
fuit.</HI> What all the Churches of
Christ in all places, have ever successively
<PB N="282" REF="150">
received, that is universal Tradition;
and he is no true Catholick that doth
not receive it. Where there is a Catho|lick
consent and harmony to bear witness
to any Interpretation, and that sense is
universally and solemnly accepted; as it
will seem a wilful errour to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rt from
it, and to choose solitary and dangerous
by-paths, where the open road is so free
and safe; so what can be expected in
such singularity, but many absurdities,
and implications, and violences offered to
the word and truth?</P>
<P>13. We must interpret according to
the Analogy of Faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 6 2 Tim. 1. 13</NOTE> We must <HI>hold
fast the form of sound words.</HI> Examine
the Interpretations of the holy Scriptures
by those three Forms, the Creed, the ten
Commandments, and the Lords Prayer.
Mistake not, you are not to examine the
Scriptures by any thing else, nor the
sense of them neither by any Creed far|ther
than it contains it self within the
very terms verbal or real of the holy
Scriptures themselves. But as the Creed
contains it self within such terms, we
are to hold it fast as a form of sound
words. And as by the ten Command|ments,
we may discern what are the
<PB N="283" REF="150">
words of God, and what are the Com|mandment
of men; and by the Lords
Prayer, what Petitions we are to put up
to God, and what Prayers we are to say
<HI>Amen</HI> to: so by the Creed we may know
what doctrines are of God, and what
of men: And let what will be pretend|ed,
if any man teach otherwise, and
consent not to these wholesom words;
he is proud, knowing nothing, he is of
a corrupt mind, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">probate concern|ing
the Faith.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Head in the words
of judicious Mr. <HI>Calvin, Expertus pridem
sum, &amp; quidem saepius, quicunque de ver|bis
pertinacius litigant, fovere occultum vi|rus;
ut magis expediat eos ultro prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">care
qu&agrave;m in eorum gratiam obscurius loqui:</HI>
A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d the liberty of not using the very
words of Scripture on some occasions,
hath ever been accounted lawful in the
Church of Christ; and is at some times
very necessary for the obviating of grow|ing
Heresies.</P>
<P>Where all these Helps are either want|ing,
or do not avail us, as to some par|ticulars
and single clauses, not so necessa|ry
to be known; The Hebrew and Greek
Idiotisms (elegancies or proprieties)
<PB N="284" REF="151">
may possibly guide us to the true and
genuine sense and interpretation.</P>

<HEAD>3. Subsequent Rules.</HEAD>
<P>1. We must pray again.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug.</NOTE> <HI>Orationi lectio,
lectioni succedat Oratio.</HI> We must pray
and read, read and pray again.</P>
<P>2. We must medi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e upon the Scrip|tures
we have read and understood, and
that sometimes will lead us into the true
meaning of those which in our course of
reading we understand not: For Scrip|ture
will give light to Scripture.</P>
<P>3. We must both before and after our
reading the holy Scriptures, get the gui|dance
of Gods holy Spirit. Methinks I
hear God saying to each of you that are
much in reading the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">criptures,
<HI>Vnderstand you what you read?</HI> And you
again saying to God, How can we, except
thy holy Spirit guide us! <HI>Ask my be|loved
in our Lord Iesus Christ, and it shall
be given,</HI> Luk. 11. 9, 13.</P>
<P>Suffer the word of Exhortation; You
that are much in reading the holy Scrip|tures;
content not your selves with
bare reading, but in the use of all at|tainable
<PB N="285" REF="151">
means endeavour to under|stand
what you read of them.</P>
<P>To perswade hereunto take these two
Motives.</P>
<P>1. The bare reading of the holy
Scriptures will be unprofitable to you.
It will be to you as he that speaketh in
an unknown tongue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 14. 2, 9, 14</NOTE> whom none of
you understandeth; or as he that
speaketh into the air, whose speech
is unfruitful. Indeed the Scripture is
the Water of life, but to you the
fountain is sealed. It is as the Garden
of the Lord; But behold <HI>Cherubims, and
a flaming Sword,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 24</NOTE> <HI>which turneth every
way, to keep the way of the Tree of
Life.</HI> You are kept out of this Garden,
while you are kept ignorant of the
true sense and meaning of the Scrip|ture,
which is as the Soul and Life of
it. It is a Vision, but the Vision be|cometh
to you as the words of a
Book that is Sealed, which men deliver
to one that is learned, saying, Read
this I pray thee; and he saith, I can|not,
for it is Sealed. By what hath
in brief been said, you see that the
bare unintelligent reading of the holy
<PB N="286" REF="152">
Scriptures themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 44. 10</NOTE> is in this like a
a Graven Image which we are sure is
profitable for nothing.</P>
<P>2. But contrariwise, if you under|stand
what you read, the Scripture of
all writings, will be the most profi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a|ble
unto you, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16. 'Tis by
way of eminency called The Scripture, as
the Original first writing, as the hand|writing
of God.</P>
<P>It is in <HI>Genere materiae,</HI> sufficient to
save our souls. It is as that Tree menti|oned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 19. and 119.</NOTE>
<HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 2. which bare twelve
manner, and yielded her fruit every
moneth; and the leaves of the Tree
were for the healing of the Nation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.
There is more weight in one Sentence of
Scripture than in all Orations, Declama|tions,
Poets, Satyrs, and Philosophick
invectives. It was a wise observation of
<HI>Scaliger,</HI> that some passages in <HI>Plato</HI> are
wiser than their Authour, and many ex|cellent
conceits are recollected from <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
and <HI>Aristotle</HI> they never dreamed of:
But in the Word of God it is quite con|trary,
for after all the recollections that
have been made by the most acute Sages of
the world; we must say with the Queen
<PB N="287" REF="152">
of <HI>Sheba</HI> in another case, the one half
hath not been told us. I shall therefore
conclude this Exhortation and Discourse
in the words of holy and learned <HI>Baxter,
As you love your Comfort, your Faith,
your Hope, your Safety, your Innocency,
your Souls, your Christ, your Everlasting
Rest; Love, Reverence, Read, Search,
Study, Obey, and stick close to the Scrip|tures.</HI></P>
