<P>And since all the said kindes come or are caused of one beginning, and for the better expedition in that, we will be brief, ye shall first take away the superfluous moisture of the brain, which is the root and fountain of all the said diseases, and that ye may do four manner of wayes. The first observance is of diet inclining to dryness and to avoid all ful|ness of meat and drink, and not to sleep in any wise after meat. And ye must beware that ye eat no vaporous meats nor thin Wine, nor d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ink much after supper; And if per|chance the pain be very sharp it shall be whol|some to abstain from all kinds of wine, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o use himself to small drink which thing if he cannot do, let him drink Claret wine mixed with a good quantity of water.</P>
