<HEAD>To all true lovers of Mirth and VVit.</HEAD>
<P>_TO you, as to the onely few, I de|dicate this Book, for there are not many so wise and happy now adayes. You neither thinking harm, nor doing any, and so have the lesse done to you, whilst those who alwaies trouble others and themselves, never want others to trouble them again, and so live wretchedly and miserably all their lives.</P>
<P>Let us do then in these times as I have seen the wiser sort of passengers doe in <HI>Holland</HI> ships, when the weather has been a little foul, get under hatches, and make our selves as merry as we can, whilst for those busie bodies, who will needs be talking and medling above decks, I have seen the skipper with a good ropes end sometimes, courteously intreat them to go down and not trouble them.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">Mean time thou maist entertaine thy selfe with this, which I desire thou wouldst be so charitable to believe, is no part of my Study, but my Recreation, written chiefly to divert the grief and melancholy of a certain illustri|ous personage, too much pressing &amp; oppressing her noble minde, and that in as few dayes (almost) as 'tis divided into <HI>Jornadas,</HI> with onely the allowance of some small time for the polishing it, which I have not done so accu|rately; but thou maist well perceive, I affect not these, <HI>difficiles nugae,</HI> or studied toyes: however, if you like it, I care not, for your dull melancholy people, who never laughed since the Kings death; and relish Iests as Horses doe Italian Sallets, and French Ra|gouts.

<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>BEtwixt Poetry &amp; Painting there is neer relation, Poetry being but a speaking Picture, as Painting a silent Poem. So have you Poets and Painters excellent in their several kindes. For your <HI>Virgil,</HI> or Heroique Poet, a <HI>Raphael,</HI> and <HI>Titian.</HI> For your <HI>Horace,</HI> or <HI>Lyrique,</HI> a <HI>Holbeen,</HI> and <HI>Vandick,</HI> representing particular persons to the life; as for your Burlesque, or Drol|ling Poem, a <HI>Brughel,</HI> and (in his kinde) <HI>Callot,</HI> representing Grotesque &amp; fantastick figures. In which way there has been fewer excellent than in any other, as being the most witty and ingenious, your other putting you too much on the gravity, to be alwaies witty, and having somewhat else to sustaine the dignity of the person when that failes; but here wit is all, which failing once, the work presently falls flat, and the Author has nothing left for his support,
<PB REF="4">
whose part 'tis to sustain the matter, and not the matter him.</P>
<P>Of this kinde is the Poem I present thee here, which when its figures are lively, and representations naturall, is one of the de|lightfullest of all; where note, that as na|tions grow more polite and witty, they fall upon this strain, it being the luxuriant branches of a flourishing language, and the very interiour of it, beyond the accesse of vulgar wits, whither (as in <HI>China</HI>) no stran|ger can arrive. So your <HI>Dutch,</HI> and more Northern nations, could never get past <HI>Iack puddings,</HI> or <HI>Pickle-herrings,</HI> stale jests yet, which none but <HI>Beer brewers</HI> can laugh at, whilst your severest <HI>Statesmen,</HI> and refinedst <HI>Wits</HI> can laugh at these.</P>
<P>That I use some broad words sometimes, 'tis but conform to the pattern I imitate: <HI>Brughel</HI> representing, without any dishone|sty, here a <HI>Boor</HI> shiting, there a <HI>Boorinne</HI> pis|sing, to render the vulgar more ridiculous <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">are properly the subject of ridiculousness) and whose follies, abuses, and vices, are pro|perly the subject of Satyre: for the rest never was <HI>Indian</HI> contriving feathers intopicture,
<PB REF="4">
more careful of their shadows, than I not to give <HI>umbrage</HI> unto any, who reverence Authority, honour all noble Persons, and especially am a devoted servant unto La|dies; yet to think to satisfie all objections, were to think to peel a <HI>Bulbus</HI> root to its last rinde, or sweep an Earthen floor to its last grain of dust, especially here, where they understand <HI>railing,</HI> farre better than <HI>Raillery.</HI> Now if you ask me why I prefix not my name to this, as well as to my other works: besides, that I count it the slightest of them all, 'tis because those I printed only to communicate to my private friends, but intending to make this more publique, and hating to have my name lie glaring on Book-sellers stalls, I have purposely sup|pressed it here; yet so, as I care not (for sa|tisfying thy curiosity) to take thee aside from the Title-page, &amp; tell thee my name is <HI>Richard Fleckno.</HI></P>

<L>1. FRiday the twentieth of September,</L>
<L>(if day o'th' month I well remember)</L>
<L>(I know not well what time o'th' day)&punc;</L>
<L>I towards <HI>Gravesend</HI> took my way,</L>
<L>Being for <HI>London</HI> to take boat,</L>
<L>Where Water-man in Livery coat,</L>
<L>Does in boat, as pig in stye,</L>
<L>Invite ye in fresh straw to lie;</L>
<L>Where you all sorts of passengers,</L>
<L>Shall encounter on the stairs;</L>
<L>And where of Company there's none failes,</L>
<L>To meet with Tag, and Rag, and Long-taile.</L>
</LG>

<L>Mean time, good sport it was to heare,</L>
<L>How water-men would jibe and jeer:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="6">Has gotten now new way of jeering,</L>

<L>And <HI>Rogue</HI> and <HI>Rascall</HI> is no more</L>
<L>Their Dialect as 'twas before.</L>
<L>Here none of them but had the art</L>
<L>To call his Father Knave by craft;</L>
<L>And all of them for th' nonce were made,</L>
<L>If imperfection ought you had,</L>
<L>To make it more ridiculous,</L>
<L>By their jesting at it thus:</L>
<L>They'd tell an ill-lookt fellow, he has</L>
<L>Robb'd Jack-an-apes, and stolne his face,</L>
<L>And wry-neck they would ask with laughter,</L>
<L>What newes 'twas he was hearkning after?</L>
<L>Long nose, they'd say, was good to make</L>
<L>Handle for Jaques; and for Crook-back,</L>
<L>If all trades fail'd (quoth they) he wo'd</L>
<L>At least for Ape-carrier be good.</L>
<L>In fine, nothing from head to foot,</L>
<L>But somewhat th'ad to say unto't,</L>
<L>So witty, as (would you should know it)</L>
<L>'T might well beseem their Water-poet:</L>
<L>But principally he does glory</L>
<L>In telling of you bawdy story,</L>
<L>Which if any woman's there</L>
<L>He addresses still to her,</L>
<L>And you must laugh at, or you spoyle</L>
<L>His story, and himselfe the while.</L>

<LG>
<L>2. To <HI>Billingsgate</HI> now as we came,</L>

<L>Now on aboard the ships, like <HI>Edgar,</HI></L>
<L>Triumphs there, and off goes head geer,</L>
<L>While she with Elf-locks 'bout her eares,</L>
<L>Just like <HI>Medusa</HI>'s head appeares.</L>
<L>Instead of turning you to stone,</L>
<L>Throwing stones at every one;</L>
<L>Tother with save-guard off, as troubled,</L>
<L>As ere was dancing Dog in doublet;</L>
<L>In torn smock, with small compliance,</L>
<L>Denounces unto all defiance&punc;</L>
<L>There over and over one does come,</L>
<L>Lighting by chance upon her bumm;</L>
<L>Others more expert, just like Cats</L>
<L>Alwaies light upon their pats;</L>
<L>Amongst whom there was such stink</L>
<L>Of fish, but more of them you'd think,</L>

<L>3. From thence o're <HI>Hyde-park</HI> way I took,</L>

<L>Writing one blow with their pen</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>First <HI>Carman</HI> lightly skirmished,</L>

<LG>
<L>Who being the off-spring of a River</L>

<L>That she could make water excellent well.</L>
