<P>THE Signal Diagnostick WHEREBY We are to judge of our own Affections; And as well of our Present, as Future State. OR THE LOVE of CHRIST PLANTED Upon the very same TURF, on which It once had been Supplanted by The Extreme Love of Sin.</P>
<P>BEING The substance of several Sermons, deliver'd at several Times and Places, and now at last met together to make up the Treatise which ensues.</P>

<HEAD>A Premonition to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been many times importun'd, since the Fire of <HI>London,</HI> both to permit a <HI>new Impression</HI> of my <HI>Sinner Impleaded,</HI> and to grati|fie my <HI>Stationer</HI> with some <HI>Inlargement,</HI> I could not think of a fitter Subject, in relation to the <HI>Method</HI> I first proposed to my self, than that of which I am writing this brief Account.</P>
<P>My <HI>method</HI> was avowedly That of the <HI>Husband|man</HI> in the Parable; who does not only think fit to <HI>cleanse</HI> the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jer. 4. 3.</NOTE> <HI>fallow ground</HI> of the <HI>Heart,</HI> before he <HI>sowes</HI> it, but <HI>sowes</HI> it throughly when it is <HI>clean</HI> too. And so accordingly having indeavour'd, in my <HI>first</HI> Practical Essay, (and in hope of God's Blessing on it) to <HI>weed</HI> out of mine own, and out of other mens Natures, <HI>the Love of Sin;</HI> I was to labour in my <HI>second,</HI> (and by the same Blessing of God, on which alone we depend for any Proportionable success,) to <HI>Stock</HI> the very same <HI>ground</HI> with the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI> It being certainly not enough, (however absolutely needful,) <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">Jer. 10. 12.</NOTE> <HI>not to sow among Thorns,</HI> or meerly <HI>to break up the fallow ground;</HI> but (as the same Prophet words it,) we must <HI>sowe in Righteousness,</HI> to <HI>reap in Mercy.</HI> And,
<PB REF="3">
to be <HI>Positively glorified,</HI> we must not think it of force sufficient, that we be <HI>negatively good.</HI> 'Tis vain and fruitless that we endeavour, to <HI>eradicate</HI> out of our <HI>hearts</HI> the <HI>love</HI> of our <HI>Sins</HI> and <HI>Sensualities,</HI> unless it be that our <HI>Love of Christ</HI> may therein take both the <HI>deeper</HI> and <HI>faster Root.</HI> And because the <HI>Love of Christ</HI> does seem as rarely <HI>understood,</HI> as 'tis often <HI>talk't of,</HI> we must be taught <HI>wherein</HI> it <HI>lyes,</HI> and the several <HI>wayes</HI> of its <HI>Attainment.</HI> To the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>First,</HI> and to the <HI>Practice</HI> of the <HI>Second,</HI> I have directed both the First and Second Part of my <HI>Inlargement.</HI></P>
<P>As they are now put together, I know not at present what more to add, besides my humble and hearty Prayers unto <HI>the Lord of the Vineyard</HI> in which we labour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 9. 37. Luke 10. 2. 1 Cor. 3. 9.</NOTE> (and whose <HI>Harvest</HI> we are in one sense, as well as his <HI>Husbandry</HI> in the second, and his <HI>Labourers</HI> in a <HI>third,</HI>) that whilst we are <HI>Plowing</HI> what we have <HI>fal|low,</HI> and are <HI>Planting</HI> what we have <HI>Plow'd,</HI> and are <HI>Watering</HI> what we have <HI>Planted,</HI> He who is said<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 10. 12. 1 Cor. 3. 6, &amp; 7.</NOTE> to <HI>rain Righteousness</HI> will bless our Labours with <HI>Increase.</HI></P>

<PB REF="7">
which is not <HI>weighty,</HI> and <HI>emphatical;</HI> and hardly an <HI>Emphasis</HI> on a word, which affords not <HI>matter</HI> of <HI>Meditation.</HI></P>
<P>Let us put our <HI>first Emphasis</HI> upon the Particle<NOTE PLACE="marg">I.</NOTE> [<HI>If</HI>] a conjunction conditional. For 'tis not <HI>Peremptorily</HI> said, my <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>you</HI> hath been so <HI>great,</HI> and my <HI>Favours</HI> to you so <HI>many,</HI> as that <HI>ye cannot choose</HI> but love me, or ye <HI>must</HI> love me of <HI>necessity;</HI> but the Proposal is <HI>ex hypothesi.</HI> Our Saviour does not say <HI>Because,</HI> but <HI>If</HI> ye love me; thereby making it a question, whether we <HI>love</HI> him or love him <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>And this deserves to be the Subject of no small <HI>Trouble</HI> or <HI>Humiliation,</HI> whilst we pretend to be the <HI>Followers</HI> and <HI>Friends</HI> of Christ, that we should be of such <HI>barbarous</HI> and <HI>inhuman</HI> dispositions, as to be <HI>able</HI> to be <HI>cold</HI> in our affection towards <HI>Him,</HI> who is <HI>inflamed</HI> towards <HI>us</HI> in <HI>His</HI> affection.</P>
<P>A <HI>second Emphasis</HI> is to be put on the Pronoun<NOTE PLACE="marg">II.</NOTE> <HI>me.</HI> If ye love <HI>me,</HI> keep my Commandments. One would have thought he should have said [If ye love your <HI>own selves,</HI> if ye love your <HI>own souls,</HI> if ye will escape the <HI>Payns</HI> of <HI>Hell,</HI> or if ye will at|tain the <HI>Ioyes</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> and so if ye love your <HI>own Interest,</HI> keep my Commandments.] For what is it to <HI>Him,</HI> whether we <HI>keep</HI> them, or keep them <HI>not?</HI> He is not the <HI>better</HI> for our <HI>obedience,</HI> and sure our <HI>Rebellions</HI> can much <HI>less hurt</HI> him.

<PB REF="8">
need of our Salvation to make him <HI>happy?</HI> no, no more can our Injoyments <HI>improve</HI> his Bliss, than can our Miseries <HI>interrupt</HI> it&punc; And yet he saith, if ye love <HI>me,</HI> keep my Commandments. From whence ariseth this <HI>second Inference,</HI></P>
<P>That the greatest expression of our Lords love to <HI>us,</HI> is his taking it as a <HI>kindness,</HI> that we be kind unto <HI>Our selves;</HI> that we will love him at least so well, as to do our selves <HI>good;</HI> that we will <HI>not once meddle</HI> with that which <HI>hurts</HI> us; but let <HI>miserie alone;</HI> and apply our selves wholly to do those things, wherein our <HI>only true happiness</HI> must needs <HI>Consist.</HI></P>
<P>Let us put a <HI>third Emphasis</HI> upon the <HI>keeping of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">III.</NOTE> <HI>his Commandments,</HI> as that relates in this place to the supposed <HI>Love</HI> we bear him. And let this our <HI>third Emphasis</HI> be <HI>subdivided</HI> into <HI>three.</HI> For it will easily afford us a <HI>threefold Importance</HI> of the words, and thence will follow a <HI>threefold Inference.</HI></P>
<P>First, the words may be <HI>thus</HI> pronounced. If<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE> ye <HI>love</HI> me, if ye have any the least <HI>affection,</HI> or <HI>kind|ness</HI> for me, do so much as <HI>observe</HI> what I have <HI>ap|pointed</HI> you to <HI>Perform.</HI> And this is as if the words were spoken in the <HI>Optative mood.</HI> O that ye were <HI>wise!</HI> that ye <HI>knew those things which do belong unto your Peace!</HI> that ye would but <HI>so</HI> love me, as to <HI>keep my Commandments!</HI> from which <HI>Acception</HI> of the words the <HI>Inference</HI> certainly must be this.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">That the best <HI>Instance</HI> and <HI>Expression</HI> of <HI>our</HI> Love to <HI>Christ,</HI> is to <HI>do</HI> those things which he <HI>Injoyns</HI> us.</P>
<P>Or else the words may be accented <HI>thus,</HI> (as<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> if <HI>indicatively</HI> spoken, and by way of <HI>Asseveration,</HI>) If ye love me in <HI>good earnest,</HI> not in <HI>word,</HI> but in <HI>Reality,</HI> If ye affect me from the <HI>Heart,</HI> and not from the <HI>Teeth-outwards,</HI> ye will be <HI>sure</HI> to do what|soever I Command you. Your obedience <HI>then</HI> will be <HI>infallible;</HI> I shall not <HI>miss</HI> of its <HI>Emanations.</HI> And hence ariseth this other Inference,</P>
<P>That <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> in a <HI>Christian</HI> are two <HI>inseparable</HI> Companions; every whit as <HI>inseparable,</HI> as <HI>Hippoclides</HI> and <HI>Polystratus;</HI> or as the <HI>Parent</HI> ra|ther, and the <HI>Child;</HI> the <HI>Cause,</HI> and the <HI>effect;</HI> or whatsoever else they are which are <HI>Relata secundum esse,</HI> whereof the <HI>one</HI> does of necessity infer the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>Or the words may be read, and expounded<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> <HI>thus,</HI> (as being in the <HI>Imperative mood;</HI>) If ye love me, <HI>be sure</HI> ye keep my Commandments; make it <HI>evident</HI> that ye love me; give me the <HI>Proof</HI> of your Affection, by <HI>doing</HI> that which I <HI>require.</HI> No other <HI>Love</HI> will I <HI>accept,</HI> than what does prove its own Truth by the constant <HI>keep|ing</HI> of my <HI>Commandments.</HI> From which <HI>Acception</HI> of the words the <HI>Inference</HI> cannot but be <HI>This,</HI></P>
<P>That our <HI>obedience</HI> to the <HI>Precepts</HI> of Jesus Christ, is the <HI>only warrantable Touchstone,</HI> whereby to <HI>try</HI> and <HI>examin</HI> the love we bear unto his <HI>Person.</HI>
<PB REF="9">
This will teach us what <HI>mettle</HI> our <HI>Love</HI> is made of. And because by the force of our Love to Christ, (if it is solid, and sincere,) there is a mutual <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 John 3. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Cohabitation</HI> betwixt <HI>Him</HI> and <HI>Us</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">John 14. 23. &amp; ch. 17. 23.</NOTE> (<HI>He</HI> in <HI>us</HI> as our <HI>Head,</HI> and <HI>We</HI> in <HI>Him</HI> as his <HI>Members,</HI>) this will also become a <HI>Rule</HI> which cannot possibly deceive us, (as other Rules are wont to do,) in what it most of all imports us to labour in with|out Error, even <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 1. 10.</NOTE> the <HI>making of our Calling and Election sure.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 1. ANd sure the <HI>Truth</HI> of this Inference will not need much labour to make it evident. For <HI>all</HI> expressions of our Love, however <HI>many,</HI> or <HI>great,</HI> in point of <HI>number,</HI> or <HI>degree,</HI> are comprehen|sively reducible unto one of these Heads, either <HI>For|mal,</HI> or <HI>Real;</HI> In <HI>shew,</HI> or in <HI>substance;</HI> in <HI>word,</HI> or <HI>deed.</HI> And in respect of these two, our Blessed Savi|our does distinguish betwixt his <HI>flatterers</HI> and his <HI>Friends.</HI> We have an example of the former, <HI>Luke</HI> 6. 46. <HI>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say?</HI> We have an example of the later, 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 15. 14. <HI>Ye are my Friends, if ye do whatsoever I com|mand you.</HI> And an example of both together, <HI>Mat.</HI> 21. 28, 29, 30, 31. Where the servant that said, he <HI>would not go, but went,</HI> is more justified than the other, who said <HI>he would,</HI> but <HI>went not.</HI> Our Saviour's <HI>flatterers</HI> then are they, who make <HI>Profession</HI> of their Love; who give him very <HI>good words;</HI> who in their <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Predications</HI> breath out nothing less than <HI>kindness,</HI> and <HI>Admiration;</HI> but not proceeding any farther, than the bare <HI>wording,</HI> and <HI>professing,</HI> and <HI>breathing out</HI> of their Affection, they cannot challenge a better <HI>character&punc;</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="28" MS="y">
than that <HI>they love him from the teeth outwards,</HI> and this because their <HI>Expressions</HI> are meerly <HI>verbal.</HI> Whereas the <HI>Friends</HI> of Christ are they, who add the <HI>Proof</HI> of Love to the due Profession; study to <HI>live</HI> by his <HI>Ex|ample,</HI> and in <HI>obedience</HI> to his <HI>Commands;</HI> espowse a <HI>Fellowship</HI> with his <HI>Death,</HI> and a <HI>conformity</HI> to his <HI>Suffer|ings;</HI> are rather for <HI>Christ,</HI> though at the <HI>Barr,</HI> than for a <HI>Pilate,</HI> though on the <HI>Bench;</HI> very much rather for the <HI>oppressed,</HI> than for the <HI>persecuting</HI> side.

<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 2. That this indeed is the difference betwixt the <HI>flatterers</HI> and <HI>Friends</HI> of Christ, as betwixt a meer <HI>verbal</HI> and <HI>Real</HI> Love, we have a full confirmation from the words of S. <HI>Iohn.</HI> My little children, (saith<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 3. 18.</NOTE> he,) <HI>Let us not love in word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed, and in Truth.</HI> That is, let our Love be <HI>without dissimulation;</HI> let it be <HI>legible</HI> in our <HI>Actions,</HI> not only <HI>audible</HI> in our <HI>Voice.</HI> Let us demonstrate our love to <HI>Christ,</HI> by shewing our love unto his <HI>Members.</HI> Nor that by speaking them fair, and paying Civility to persons, But <HI>by opening the Bowels of our compassion to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">verse 17.</NOTE> <HI>their needs.</HI> S. <HI>Iames,</HI> in his Epistle, hath set it out to the life. <HI>If a brother or sister</HI> (saith he) <HI>be naked,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 2. 15. 16.</NOTE> <HI>and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto him, depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, but ye give him not those things which are needful to the Body, what doth it profit?</HI> There we have in S. <HI>Iames,</HI> by way of <HI>Instance,</HI> what we found in S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> by way of <HI>Advice,</HI> and <HI>Ex|hortation.</HI> For he that saith, <HI>go in Peace, be ye Warm, or full,</HI> he expressly is the man that <HI>loves in word, and in tongue.</HI> But he that <HI>gives those things which are</HI>

<HI>needful to the Body,</HI> he is properly the man that <HI>loves in Deed,</HI> and in <HI>Truth.</HI></P>

Now that which is the greatest proof of our Love to Christs <HI>Members,</HI> does carry with it the greatest Proof of our Love to <HI>Christ.</HI> Who, what is don unto his <HI>Members,</HI> does take as don unto <HI>Himself.</HI> He that persecutes and plunders his <HI>Fellow-Christian,</HI> does persecute and plunder his <HI>Master Christ.</HI> And Christ hath said what he will say to such as these in the Day of Judgment, <HI>In as much as ye have don it unto one of the least of these, ye have don it unto me.

So that the reason is very evident, why S. <HI>Paul</HI> sets out our <HI>Love as the fulfilling of the Law;</HI> And summ's up <HI>all the Commandments</HI> into this one Precept, <HI>Thou shalt</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>love thy Neighbour as thy self;</HI> Because the <HI>Proof</HI> of our <HI>obedience</HI> to the <HI>Commandments of the Law,</HI> is our <HI>do|ing unto others,</HI> (in Acts of Justice, and works of Mer|cy,) as we would that <HI>others should do to us.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, so very strict is the Connexion betwixt the <HI>Love</HI> we have to <HI>God,</HI> and our <HI>love</HI> to <HI>one another,</HI> as well as betwixt the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Both,</HI> and the <HI>keeping of the Commandments,</HI> that S. <HI>Iohn</HI> sets them down as the <HI>Marks</HI> and <HI>Tokens</HI> of one another. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 5. 1, 2, 3.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> in a <HI>Christian,</HI> as two <HI>inse|parable Companions,</HI> every whit as <HI>inseparable</HI> as the <HI>Cause,</HI> and the <HI>Effect;</HI> or whatsoever else they are, whereof the one doth of necessity infer the other.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 1. AND first because there is a Fallacy which many impose upon themselves, whilst they think it as possible to <HI>love</HI> their Saviour, without the keeping of his Commandments, as to <HI>know</HI> or <HI>ap|prehend</HI> him, without the keeping of his Command|ments, I shall begin with the great Difference betwixt the two natures of <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Knowledge.</HI> The <HI>end</HI> of <HI>Knowledge</HI> is to possess that which is <HI>True:</HI> but the <HI>end</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> is to possess that which is <HI>Good.</HI> Knowledge is an act of the <HI>Understanding,</HI> but Love a <HI>motion</HI> of the <HI>Appetite.</HI> Knowledge is seated in the <HI>Head,</HI> but Love especially in the <HI>Heart.</HI> Both are <HI>possessed</HI> of their <HI>objects</HI> by way of <HI>union;</HI> but the <HI>union</HI> of <HI>Knowledge</HI> seems meerly <HI>passive,</HI> as being made in the <HI>understand|ing&punc;</HI> which being possest of its object is quite at <HI>Rest.</HI> Whereas the <HI>union</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> is wholly <HI>Active,</HI> as being made in the <HI>Appetite,</HI> and by consequence in the <HI>Heart;</HI> which being possessed of its object by an <HI>Intentional union,</HI> is so very far from <HI>resting</HI> content with <HI>That,</HI> that it employs every Faculty to gain the object that is <HI>belov'd,</HI> not only by an <HI>intentional,</HI> but <HI>real</HI> union. So great and wide is the difference 'twixt <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Know|ledge,</HI> that <HI>knowledge</HI> is but an <HI>idle, unfruitful</HI> thing,
<PB N="50" REF="34">
till it is quickned by the <HI>Industry</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> of <HI>Love.</HI> Our <HI>Knowledge</HI> of Christ, as we are taught by sad ex|perience, is often <HI>Barren.</HI> But 'tis as evident by ex|perience, that the <HI>Love</HI> we bear to him is ever <HI>Fruit|ful;</HI> and the <HI>Fruit</HI> it <HI>brings forth</HI> is ever the <HI>keeping of his Commandments.</HI> For</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 2. <HI>Secondly, This</HI> we are taught by the <HI>light</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> That to perfect our <HI>union</HI> with what we <HI>love,</HI> (by our Injoyment of its <HI>possession,</HI>) we are to use the best <HI>means</HI> whereby to make ourselves <HI>lovely;</HI> that so the person whom we <HI>love,</HI> may <HI>himself</HI> be a <HI>Lover,</HI> as well as <HI>we.</HI> And sure the most <HI>effectual means</HI> whereby to make our selves <HI>lovely,</HI> is our <HI>Conformity</HI> to the <HI>Hu|mour</HI> and <HI>Disposition</HI> of what we <HI>love.</HI> For a <HI>recipro|cated love</HI> implyes a <HI>Harmony</HI> and <HI>Concord</HI> between two parties; whereby each <HI>object</HI> is <HI>Agent</HI> too; and each person <HI>lov'd</HI> becomes a <HI>Lover,</HI> by the <HI>Conformity</HI> which he finds unto all his <HI>own humours</HI> in That which <HI>loves</HI> him. Nor need we <HI>labour</HI> after this, as a thing gainable by <HI>Art,</HI> for nothing but <HI>flattery</HI> can stand in need of such <HI>help;</HI> and <HI>flattery</HI> is no more than the <HI>Ape</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> just as <HI>Art</HI> is no more than the <HI>Ape</HI> of <HI>Nature.</HI> But if indeed we do intensely and truely <HI>Love,</HI> it will not be an <HI>artificial,</HI> but a most <HI>natural</HI> issue of it. To frame our <HI>manners</HI> and <HI>Conversations</HI> in proportion to the <HI>temper</HI> of our <HI>Beloved.</HI> Now if <HI>Christ</HI> is the object we truely <HI>love,</HI> we shall long after an <HI>union;</HI> and ear|nestly labour to <HI>possess</HI> him, by being first <HI>possessed</HI> by him. Because till he <HI>stoops</HI> to <HI>our</HI> embraces, we can|not possibly <HI>rise</HI> to <HI>His.</HI> And being convinc&punc;t he will not <HI>have</HI> us, until he finds us <HI>worth the having,</HI> (or at least in a capacity of being <HI>Had,</HI>) how shall we search after the <HI>means</HI> whereby to be <HI>fitted</HI> for his <HI>Acceptance?</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="34">
we shall incessantly cast about, which way to <HI>please</HI> him; and frame the <HI>course</HI> of our <HI>Lives</HI> to what we think <HI>He loves best.</HI> We shall <HI>strive</HI> and <HI>contend</HI> after the <HI>knowledge</HI> of his Will, with <HI>this</HI> intent only, that we may <HI>do</HI> it. And having found that his <HI>Commandments</HI> are the <HI>Transcriptions</HI> of his Will, we shall compose our whole selves to <HI>the keeping</HI> of them. And having don all we can, shall never think we have don enough; for that our <HI>Love,</HI> being <HI>Infinite,</HI> can never satisfie it|self with any expressions which are <HI>not such.</HI> So that if we love Christ with the <HI>whole Treasure</HI> of our <HI>Affection,</HI> our <HI>obedience</HI> will know neither <HI>end,</HI> nor <HI>measure;</HI> but will be coveting to demonstrate itself as <HI>Infinite,</HI> as is that <HI>object</HI> which doth <HI>attract</HI> it.

<PB N="52" REF="35">
most affectionately a <HI>servant to the Lord Iesus Christ,</HI> and does bestow his whole Time in doing the things that he Commands. Let the <HI>object</HI> of our Love be what it will, whether <HI>God,</HI> or the <HI>World;</HI> the <HI>Flesh,</HI> or the <HI>Spirit,</HI> still the Rule of the Apostle will be unal|terably true, <HI>That to whom we yield our selves servants</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. 16.</NOTE> <HI>to obey, His servants we are to whom we obey, whether of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Righteousness.</HI> Love is ever so sure to beget obedience, that when our <HI>Saviour</HI> would give a <HI>reason,</HI> why no one man can <HI>serve</HI> two masters, (meaning those two, call'd <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Mammon,</HI>) he made his reason to stand in this, that no one man can <HI>love</HI> two Masters. For <HI>either he</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 16. 13.</NOTE> <HI>will hate the one, and love the other, or will hold to the one, and despise the other.</HI> So that if we <HI>love God,</HI> we shall be sure to hate <HI>Mammon;</HI> and if again we <HI>hold to Mammon,</HI> we shall <HI>rebel</HI> against <HI>God.</HI> Whereas if it were possible to <HI>love</HI> them Both, it would also be as possible to <HI>serve</HI> them Both; because by the persons whom we <HI>love,</HI> we cannot but love to be <HI>employ'd. The love of Christ doth constrain us,</HI> saith our <HI>Apostle</HI> to his <HI>Corinthians.</HI> And as <HI>Christ's</HI> love of <HI>us,</HI> so <HI>ours</HI> of<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Cor. 5. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Him</HI> doth even <HI>press</HI> upon us, and <HI>urge</HI> us, to <HI>keep his Commandments, and to do those things which are pleasing in his sight.</HI></P>
<P>But let us farther make it appear by a fourth way of arguing. For</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 4. Whatsoever we love the most, is either <HI>present</HI> or <HI>absent.</HI> And as when it is <HI>present,</HI> we most <HI>delight</HI> in it; so whilst it is <HI>absent,</HI> we do <HI>long</HI> the most <HI>after</HI> it. But the Apostle tells us expresly, that <HI>whilst</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>at home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord; for we walk by Faith, and not by sight.</HI> So that if we <HI>love</HI>

Christ, we shall <HI>long</HI> after his <HI>presence;</HI> and if we truly <HI>long</HI> for it, we shall indeavour its <HI>attainment.</HI> And if we indeavour to reach the <HI>end,</HI> there will be nothing more natural, than to inquire after the <HI>means.</HI> And finding the means to be <HI>obedience,</HI> we shall undoubt|edly <HI>obey.</HI> The <HI>Helkesaitae</HI> prov'd nothing but that themselves were <HI>stupid sinners,</HI> in conceiving it possi|ble to <HI>deny</HI> Christ with the <HI>Mouth,</HI> and yet to <HI>love</HI> him with the <HI>Heart.</HI> For the <HI>Heart</HI> in a <HI>Man;</HI> like the <HI>Spring</HI> in a <HI>Watch,</HI> is that that sets all on work, both <HI>Tongue,</HI> and <HI>Eyes,</HI> and <HI>Hands,</HI> and <HI>Feet</HI> too.

This is easily collected from three words in the Text, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Ye are my Disciples.</HI></P>
<P>It is secondly <HI>suppos'd,</HI> that such as are <HI>really</HI> Christs Disciples, (not in hypocrisy, but in deed,) ought to endeavour to make <HI>it known to all THE WORLD,</HI> that they are <HI>such.</HI> Their <HI>light must shine before men,</HI> by their <HI>Procope</HI> and <HI>Growth</HI> in the <HI>SCHOOL</HI> of Christ. This is apparent from two words more, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>All men shall know it.</HI> And were it not so in good earnest, the Master would never have directed them (as here he does) to the infallible means of it's attainment. For</P>
<P>We are thirdly to observe the important <HI>Lesson</HI> which here is <HI>Taught,</HI> (and which is <HI>now</HI> of all
<PB REF="76">
Lessons the most worth learning, especially if we reflect on the Times we live in,) by what cer|tain <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>way of proof,</HI> we may make men to <HI>know</HI> we are Christs Disciples. This is de|liver'd in the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>last</HI> words of the Text, <GAP DESC="foreign">, they shall know it <HI>even by this,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>If ye bear love to one another.</HI></P>
<P>From these three parts there are as many Pro|positions, into which the whole Text is very na|turally resolv'd.</P>
<P>That all who are <HI>Auditors</HI> of Christ, or all to<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE> whom he is <HI>reveal'd,</HI> do stand oblig'd by that means, to be <HI>really his Disciples.</HI></P>
<P>That their Discipleship, if it be <HI>real,</HI> will be<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> <HI>eminent also,</HI> and <HI>exemplary,</HI> so far forth as to be <HI>known,</HI> and taken notice of by <HI>All.</HI></P>
<P>That the surest <HI>Testimony</HI> and <HI>Proof</HI> of sincere<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> Discipleship under Christ, and the principal <HI>In|stance</HI> or <HI>effect</HI> wherein its eminence doth consist, and that which by Christ is here pronounced as an <HI>unerrable mark</HI> or <HI>Criterion</HI> of it, is this Divine Qualification of <HI>mutual Love.</HI></P>
<P>And this alone must be the Subject upon which I am to fasten the following part of my Design; because it seems to comprehend (I say not only the <HI>prime,</HI> but) <HI>whole</HI> Importance of the Text; as we may judge by comparing the <HI>proposition,</HI> with the <HI>fourfold Emphasis</HI> which may be put upon the words.</P>

<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 1.

First, 'tis profitable for <HI>Doctrin,</HI> because it<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE> teacheth such as are ignorant, the true importance of <HI>Christianity,</HI> which does not consist (as some would have it) in our being <HI>born</HI> of <HI>godly Parents, believing</HI> the History of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> making <HI>profession</HI> of zeal to <HI>Christ,</HI> posting up and down from <HI>Sermon</HI> to <HI>Sermon,</HI> making many and long <HI>prayers,</HI> or whatsoever is com|prehended under the <HI>Form of Godliness,</HI> that is, the Image, the Picture, the Counterfeit of Devotion, (as the word in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">&punc;</NOTE> Original does very naturally import, 2 Tim. 3. 5.)
