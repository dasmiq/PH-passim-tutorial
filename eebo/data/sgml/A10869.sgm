<P>_ALthough (right worshipfull) my longer

ingratitude, or forgetfulnes, in <HI>Sene|caes</HI>
censure the greater of the two; yet
I not great in fortunes grace, younge in

fully resolued to trauerse the indictme~t,
vntill more store of wealth, graver age,
&amp; greater practise, might warrant me~
to performe that indeed which now I can but promise in conceipte.
And in that resolution, considering the vndigested method was fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

determined to make an her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">icke of this illiterate pa~phlet, &amp; com|mit
it to the fire; but yet respecting the goodnesse of the argument,
the greatnes of your vertues, and many thanke-worthy benefites
bestowed both by your selfe, and your right worshipfull husbande I
fell from this faint determination to a second and more sound reso|lution,
<HI>Phaeton</HI>-like to carry <HI>Atlas</HI> his burden, and rather to ha|zarde
a faulte in manners then incurre a blemish in nature, ra|ther
(by beeing to bolde) to make you the patrones of so simple a
worke, then by silence to seeme vnthank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">full. And albeit in per|forming
heereof I shall rather wronge my selfe in bewraying mine

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">unswerable to your vvorth; yet my heartes hope is, that as

mountaine; yet I doubt not but you will nourish it for the hill
<HI>Syons</HI> sake (a speciall obiect of your godly minde) from whence by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nduction it is derived. The method I confesse is the more absurde
by reason it was ordered without advice since my comming into the
