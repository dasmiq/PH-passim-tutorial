<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THis <HI>Comedy</HI> is taken out of several Excellent Pieces of <HI>Moliere.</HI> The main plot of the <HI>Damoiselles</HI> out of his <HI>Pretieusee's Ridiculee's;</HI> the Counterplot of <HI>Sganarelle,</HI> out of his <HI>Escole des Femmes,</HI> and out of the <HI>Escole des Marys,</HI> the two <HI>Naturals;</HI> all which like so many <HI>Pretieuse</HI> stones, I have brought out of <HI>France;</HI> and as a Lapidary set in one Jewel to adorn our <HI>English Stage:</HI> And I hope my set|ting them, and giving them an <HI>English</HI> foyle, has nothing diminisht of their native luster. And I have not only done like one who makes a posie out of divers flowers in which he has nothing of his own, (besides the collection, and ordering them) but like the <HI>Bee,</HI> have extracted the spirit of them into a certain Quintes|sence of mine own.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">For the Language of the <HI>Pretieuse,</HI> it may be wondred that I durst attempt the <HI>Englishing</HI> it (so often attempted by our best <HI>English</HI> wits, and as often despaired of) it being a Language even new unto the <HI>French</HI> themselves, and so little understood by most of them, as they are forc'd to make a Dictionary for it apart; which notwithstanding I have done, and I hope with that success, as I have not only made the Language of the Author, <HI>English,</HI> but even the spirit, life, and quickness of it too.</P>
<P>For my Printing it before 'tis Acted, 'tis only to give the Auditors their Bill of Fare before hand; so far from taking away their Appetites of seeing it after|wards, as (on the contrary) if they like it, it increases it but the more; and if every one who writes for the Stage wou'd but do the like, there wou'd not be so much deceit in it as there is&punc; Nor do I it to render it more publick, but only more legible, (few having patience to read more then a Letter in written
<PB REF="4">
hand) and I may well say I have found out the secret of Printing, since <HI>writ|ten</HI> Copies communicated to many, and <HI>Printed</HI> only to few, are secrets alike.</P>
<P>For the Acting it, those who have the Governing of the Stage, have their Humours, and wou'd be intrea|ted; and I have mine, and w'ont in|treat them; and were all Drammatick VVriters of my mind, they shou'd wear their old <HI>Playes</HI> Thred-bare, e're they shou'd have any <HI>New,</HI> till they better understood their own Interest, and how to distinguish betwixt good and bad.</P>
<P>Mean time I suppose 'twill not be difficult for all who read this <HI>Comedy,</HI> to comprehend, how the VVorld's a a Theater, every place a Stage, all vvho read and understand, Actors
<PB REF="5">
and Auditors, and there may be as good Playes now a daies <HI>not Acted,</HI> as <HI>Acted,</HI> at our Theaters, and by our Actors here.</P>

<L>Why to the Theater, 'tis past three o'th Clock,</L>
<L>and the Play's ready to begin.</L>

<L>Stay a little, and I'le go along w'ye.</L>
<L>They say y'ave a new Play to day?</L>

<P>We have so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who's the Author? who made it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that 'tis no matter, so the Play be good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>By your favour, but 'tis though,</L>
<L><PB REF="6">and a great matter too; for oftentimes</L>
<L>the reputation of the Author, is more</L>
<L>then half the goodness of the Play.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Let it suffice, 'tis one who has been more</L>
<L>then a Prentiship at the Trade,</L>
<L>and 'tis with Poets, and their Playes,</L>
<L>as with Potters, and their Vessels,</L>
<L>where (most commonly) your young beginners</L>
<L>Marr half a dozen</L>
<L>before they can make one.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>But has he any Faction for him?</L>
<L>has he any to cry him up, in court or town?</L>
<L>else he'l be sure to be cryed down</L>
<L>before the Curtain's drawn, or Musick</L>
<L>play.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>For that he's of an odd humour,</L>
<L>and says h'ad rather stand on his own legs,</L>
<L>then stalk on stilts of others favours.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>That's the surest way indeed,</L>
<L>but t'other (now adays) the more plausible</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>And what thinks he of it himself? for</L>
<L>none can do any thing but by chance,</L>
<L>who knows not how well he does it.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>For him to praise or dispraise it</L>
<L>were vanity,</L>
<L>and but to usurp</L>
<L><PB REF="6">upon the priviledge of the Auditors,</L>
<L>only this he dares say, 'tis a <HI>Merry Comedy,</HI></L>
<L>and he hopes will please all, but only such</L>
<L>as wou'd have Playes as serious as their business,</L>
<L>and as sad as Funeral Orations.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>But let him not be too confident of it though,</L>
<L>for 'tis a Critical Age that finds out spots</L>
<L>even in the <HI>Sun</HI> it self;</L>
<L>and mens expectations</L>
<L>never deceive them more</L>
<L>then in others judgments of their Playes;</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>For him, he is so little presumptuous,</L>
<L>as he submits his Play wholly unto</L>
<L>the judgment of the Auditors</L>
<L>with this Protestation,</L>
<L>that he shall be as little offended with</L>
<L>those who shall justly find any fault with</L>
<L>it, as he shou'd be with those who</L>
<L>shou'd find any durt</L>
<L>or spot of durt,</L>
<L>on his Hat, or Cloaths, to brush off,</L>
<L>or wipe away;&mdash;</L>
<L>nay he shou'd take it</L>
<L>as a courtesie from them rather.</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Intended for the Overture of the Theater, 1666.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN these sad Times our Author has been long</L>
<L>Studying to give you some diversion;</L>
<L>And he has ta'n the way to do't, which he</L>
<L>Thought most diverting, mirth, and Comedy:</L>
<L>And now he knows there are inough i'th Town</L>
<L>At name of Mirth and Comedy will, frown,</L>
<L>And sighing say, the times are bad what then?</L>
<L>Will their being sad &amp; heavy better them!</L>
<L>Or rather won't their sad and heavy cheer</L>
<L>Make these our times worse then they ar appear?</L>
<L>Sadness for Physick may be sometimes good;</L>
<L>But cheerfulness shou'd be our daily food;</L>
<L>Without whose most delightful seasoning,</L>
<L>Even life it self were an insipid thing.</L>
<L>'Tis a great happiness when men are sad,</L>
<L>Divertisments may any wayes be had:</L>
<L>And we do hope our Comedy to day,</L>
<L>May so divert you, as you all shall say,</L>
<L>Whilst every one some Recreation has,</L>
<L>The best and most delightful ones, are Playes.</L>
