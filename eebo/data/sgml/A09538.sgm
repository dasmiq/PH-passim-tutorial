<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONO|RABLE
AND MY SINGVLAR
GOOD LORD, CHARLES EARLE OF
Notingham, Baron of Effingham, Knight of the most
noble order of the Garter, Lord high Admirall
of England, Ireland and Wales, &amp;c. and
one of her Maiesties most
Honorable priuie
Councell.</HEAD>
<P>_YOur late fauourable intertaine|ment
(Right Honorable) vouch|safed
to this my hard fauoured
Childe, is now my incourage|ment
againe to present her to
you, clad in this new habite. She
hath cause to shroude her selfe vnder Honours
wing: for so rude is her habite, and so meane her
parentage; that were not such patronage a safe
refuge to her, when the malicious shall persecute
her: I feare she would be accounted a roague; and
for wandring abroad in so vnfauourable a time,
be scourged with the whip of disgrace, and lashed
<PB REF="3">
with the sharpe rod of euery Criticks censure.</P>
<P>Those many fauours, which you honourably
extended to my father, whilst he liued, and still
continue to his name and children; claime a farre
greater testimony of gratefulnes, then the greatest
of my small indeuours can affoord: notwithstan|ding,
accept a dutifull minde, witnessed in a rude
sort; and when <HI>Time</HI> shall with some of his fea|thers,
better cloath my scarce-feathered <HI>Muse:</HI>
she will better testifie how highly she honours and
admires your worth. In meane time pardon her
present vnworthines, and once againe take in
good worth this mine vnworthy present: where|of,
hauing reason to rest perswaded, I leaue further
to interrupt your serious affayres, and so humbly
take my leaue.</P>

<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_TO intreate their fauour that cannot be
discourteous, were superfluous: to craue
fauour of the churlish, were friuolous.
VVhat thou art, I know not; but if thou
meanest to peruse my <HI>Muses</HI> labour, ex|pect
no great matters, least thy expectation be frustrated.
It were folly to tell thee of my weakenes, hauing laide it
open to euery eye: neither will I excuse it to thee; because
I am ignorant of thy disposition. I am no <HI>Satyre</HI> to
scourge thee, if thou snarle at me: yet feare I not the most
piercing fang of peeuish enuie; being sufficiently armed
against all censures, and therefore not to be harmed by
thy censure.</P>

<L>_AMidst some gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er studies taking pause,</L>
<L>To giue my tyred spirits some delight,</L>
<L>And to refresh my wearie minde, because</L>
<L>Sometime repose is very requisite:</L>
<L>That I might take a little breathing flight,</L>
<L>I left a while to trace <HI>Philosophie,</HI></L>
<L>To please my selfe with harmlesse <HI>Poetrie.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With harmlesse <HI>Poetrie,</HI> not otherwise,</L>
<L>Lasciuious writing doth not please my vaine&punc;</L>
<L>For vaine it is, such matters to deuise,</L>
<L>As nothing else but note of folly gaine,</L>
<L>A bootlesse labour, and a fruitlesse paine,</L>
<L>Offensiue to the wise, and likte of none,</L>
<L>But those which in their hearts make <HI>Follies</HI> throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Disgrace to <HI>Poets</HI> commendable Art,</L>
<L>Making that loath'd, which euery man would loue,</L>
<L>If loue, and <HI>Cupids</HI> arrowes wanton smart,</L>
<L>Were not the greatest motiue that doth moue</L>
<L><HI>Poets</HI> their wits, in sugred verse to proue.</L>
<L>Ah, that to proue their wits most excellent,</L>
<L>To such base meanes their wils should so be bent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5">
<L><HI>Loue</HI> is too base a <HI>Subiect</HI> now to write of,</L>
<L>Common to euery ballad-makers time,</L>
<L>And farre vnfit for <HI>Scholers</HI> to indite of,</L>
<L>For they should holde more pretious their time;</L>
<L>And sure there cannot be a greater crime,</L>
<L>Then to mispend time in so lewd a wise,</L>
<L>As if we did the price thereof despise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For doe not men the pretio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s time mispend,</L>
<L>Whilst they discourse of loues and louers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">one?</L>
<L>That cannot sort to any other end,</L>
<L>Then make the hart of man soule <HI>Vices</HI> throne,</L>
<L>That of it selfe to lewdnesse is so prone:</L>
<L>Adding to smoaking flaxe a burning flame,</L>
<L>Which at first touch doth set on fire the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not such was my intent or purposde drift,</L>
<L>Pleasing to me was alwayes <HI>Poes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">:</HI></L>
<L>A soule-infused faire celestiall gift,</L>
<L>In rauishing with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eauenly harmony.</L>
<L>But <HI>Loue</HI> vntunes that pleasant melody,</L>
<L>Makes sweetest tunes to iarre and disagree,</L>
<L>Makes <HI>Art</HI> a thrall, but <HI>Arte</HI> loues to be free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And therefore when I meant in measur'd style,</L>
<L>To please my selfe and other not offend,</L>
<L>I thought loue-matters ouer base and vyle,</L>
<L>Nor of such toyes to write I did intend,</L>
<L>But other wayes my cogitations bend,</L>
<L>Three speciall sorts of writ I then did find,</L>
<L>All which I well approued in my mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5">
<L>The first is morall, and that sort indeed</L>
<L>To carpe at <HI>Vices</HI> profitable is:</L>
<L>To shew amongst good corne the noysome weed,</L>
<L>And tell the <HI>World</HI> wherein it doth amis:</L>
<L>For though the <HI>VVorld</HI> doth little count of this,</L>
<L>Yet he that herein well imployes his pen,</L>
<L>Well pleaseth <HI>God,</HI> and merits prayse with men.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The second sorte is call'd historicall,</L>
<L>That tells of sundry lamentable fates,</L>
<L>Declares the life, the death, the pompe, the fall,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Emperours,</HI> and mghty <HI>Potentates,</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>Princes,</HI> and of other <HI>Magistrates:</HI></L>
<L>And this in it much profit doth contayne,</L>
<L>By others harmes to warne them that remayne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The third sort that is allegoricall;</L>
<L>Which vnder <HI>Metaphors,</HI> and couert phrase,</L>
<L>Proposeth <HI>Vertue</HI> to the vew of all,</L>
<L>Clad in a rich attyre: that whilst men gase</L>
<L>Vpon the same, and on her beauties blase:</L>
<L>Vnwares they learne to know fayre <HI>Vertues</HI> price,</L>
<L>And see the foule deformity of <HI>Vice.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And he that in this kynd can temper well</L>
<L>Profit with sweet delight: vnto his prayse</L>
<L>Well may we yeeld, and say he doth excell,</L>
<L>And for his skill his fame to heauen vp rayse.</L>
<L>So may we speake of <HI>Spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sers</HI> golden layes,</L>
<L>Whome neuer any man could equall yet,</L>
<L>That in our tongue hath as a <HI>Poet</HI> writ.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="6">
<L>On these three sorts whilst I did ruminate,</L>
<L>As taking respite which of them to chuse,</L>
<L>That (when I should my selfe thus recteate)</L>
<L>That little time I might not vainely vse,</L>
<L>Nor such a pretious gift of <HI>God</HI> abuse:</L>
<L>I found my wit more dull then it was wont,</L>
<L>And myne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> seemed very blunt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Therefore I left my melancholy cell,</L>
<L>To set an edge on myne inuention,</L>
<L>Streight went I to a walke that likte me well,</L>
<L>That I might make some disposition</L>
<L>In order, of those things I thought vpon.</L>
<L>For many thoughts (<HI>Maze</HI>-lyke) the mynd inclose</L>
<L>Confusedly, till order them dispose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No sooner to this walke I entred then&punc;</L>
<L>But that a <HI>Subiect</HI> for my <HI>Muse</HI> I found,</L>
<L>And presently gan fit it for my pen:</L>
<L>For when I markt how chearefully the ground,</L>
<L>The herbes, the plants&punc; the trees about me round,</L>
<L>Praysd their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> in their seuerall kynd,</L>
<L>Thus I began to reason in my mynd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All creatures of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eternall <HI>God</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">,</L>

<L>Yet seeme to prayse and magnify the same&punc;</L>
<L>Is it not then an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></L>
<L>That man should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></L>
<L>Of whome <HI>God</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> him Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></L>

<LG>
<PB REF="6">
<L>Each tree doth seeme tenne thousand tongues to haue,</L>
<L>With them to laude the Lord omnipotent:</L>
<L>Each leafe, that with Windes gentle breath doth waue,
Seemes as a tongue to speake to this intent,</L>
<L>In language admirably excellent.</L>
<L>Leaues better tongues, then tongues that leaue their duty,</L>
<L>And loue to talke of nothing but of beauty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sundry sorts of fragrant floures doe seeme,</L>
<L>Sundry discourses <HI>God</HI> to glorify,</L>
<L>Far sweeter volumes may we them esteeme,</L>
<L>Then such as handle with diuersity,</L>
<L>The traynes and stratagems of fantasy:</L>
<L>For all these creatures in their seuerall sorte,</L>
<L>Prayse <HI>God,</HI> and man vnto the same exhort.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But man (his nature is so strangely dull,</L>
<L>And yet so prone to wickednes and sinne)</L>
<L>As that (vnlesse <HI>God</HI> forcibly him pull,</L>
<L>And plucke him from himselfe) h'will nere begin</L>
<L>To thinke on <HI>God,</HI> that doth inclose him in</L>
<L>With hourely blessings, (for man is so rude,</L>
<L>He renders nothing but ingratitude.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On this I thought to set my <HI>Muse</HI> on worke,</L>
<L>And on this matter largely to dilate:</L>
<L>To shew how in mans hart this vice doth lurke,</L>
<L>And to vpbrayde each sorte and each estate,</L>
<L>That for <HI>Gods</HI> benefits are so ingrate.</L>
<L>As thus I thought, I playne me thought did heare,</L>
<L>A voyce that seemed to be vtterd neare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="7">
<L>Distinct it was, and thus it playnely spake:</L>
<L>Take hold of Time when Time approacheth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ye,</L>

<L>No sooner was this spoke, but by and by</L>

<L>This sayd, away he turnd: but sodaynly,</L>
<L>I tooke fast hould vpon his front of hayre,</L>

<L>Wherein I was deceiued: for I thought</L>

<L>Content (sayd I) and vp my selfe I reared,</L>
<L>In hope to see some accident most strange:</L>
<L><HI>Time</HI> had so cheard me that I no thing feared,</L>
<L>And therefore car'd not whether <HI>Time</HI> did range:</L>
<L>Nor did it grieue me, that he made me change</L>
<L>My first intent to write in former strayne,</L>
<L>For that I meant it to resume agayne</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now I meane to tell what then I saw,</L>
<L>(Laying aside that purpose for a while.)</L>
<L>Things that perhaps might admiration draw,</L>
<L>If I could cunningly compose my stile,</L>
<L>Or eloquently my designements file;</L>
<L>Herein my want I freely doe confesse,</L>
<L>But from the matter I too much digresse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Already had we left fayre <HI>Europes</HI> clyme,</L>
<L>And lost the sight of <HI>Englands</HI> watry sands:</L>
<L>Now o're the <HI>Oceans</HI> mayne gan flitter <HI>Time,</HI></L>
<L>And straight we were in vew of other lands,</L>
<L>Perceauing kenne of other sundry strands,</L>
<L>Aswell of Ilands as of continent;</L>
<L>The sight whereof my mind did much content.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of sundry wonders I could make report,</L>
<L>That in these places <HI>Time</HI> did shew to me:</L>
<L>Of sauage men, and of a thousand sort</L>
<L>Of monsters, which (but that I them did see)</L>
<L>I would haue thought impossible to bee.</L>
<L>Some brutish beasts I saw in forme of men,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="8">
<L>But one thing did I marke especiallie:</L>
<L>As <HI>Time</HI> flew on with swift and winged speede,</L>

<LG>
<L>Young babes that sucked at their mothers breast,</L>

<L>But presently their mothers bosome leaue;</L>
<L>And in a moment doe they strength receiue,</L>
<L>That but euen now could neither goe nor stand,</L>
<L>And were inwrapped in their cradle band.</L>

<L>And streight they grow vnto perfection,</L>
<L>In wit, in strength, and euery other thing:</L>
<L>But this their prime is very quickly gon;</L>
<L><HI>Time</HI> vnto them a suddaine change doth bring.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>And then become they as they were at first:</L>
<L>For ere that <HI>Time</HI> was yet gone out of sight,</L>
<L>Children againe, and fitter to be nurst;</L>
<L>Then otherwise they were, betest of might;</L>
<L>Nothing was left them for their lifes delight.</L>

<PB REF="8">
<L>Some also lost the sight of flying <HI>Time</HI></L>

<L>For to recall him then it was too late:</L>
<L>And many knew him not, till he was gone,</L>
<L>When for his want they made their dying mone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This seemed strange to me, and made me aske</L>
<L>Of aged <HI>Time</HI> how these things came to passe:</L>
<L><HI>Time</HI> answering sayd, it's my appointed taske.</L>
<L>And, for all flesh is like to fading grasse,</L>

<L>But that which principally doth me greiue</L>
<L>Is mans contempt of me: and this indeed</L>
<L>Makes me to fly from them with swifter speed.</L>

<LG>
<L>For otherwise perhaps I would aduise me,</L>

<L>Mine eyes complaynd that they had suffred wrong,</L>
<L>Which had no rest in all this iourneying:</L>
<L>Whilst thus mine eyes their rights were chalenging,</L>
<L>I drousie waxing, fell at last on sleep;</L>
<L>Yet aged <HI>Time</HI> his passage on did keep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What past whilst thus I slept I know not well:</L>
<L>But when I wak'd, my selfe I strangely found</L>
<L>Amidst that walke, where (as I first did tell)</L>
<L>I heard the voice that <HI>Times</HI> approach did sound.</L>
<L>Vp I arose, <HI>Times</HI> absence did me wound,</L>
<L>At last I spide him flying yet in fight,</L>
<L>And home I hide these accidents to wright.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What censure passe hereon, I greatly care not:</L>
<L>If thou my noble <HI>Patron</HI> pardon me,</L>
<L>Let other readers carpe at me and spare not:</L>
<L>Sith these vnpolisht lines must publisht be,</L>
<L>For euery criticks eye my faults to see;</L>
<L>Let them detract, and blame my skills defect,</L>
<L>And scorne my <HI>Muse,</HI> so thou wilt me protect.</L>
