For there your Maiestie hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reated the present con|trouersies of Religion, with such Learning, as in a Prince

<P>Neither can it be told, whe|ther your Highnesse indeuour to propagate the truth of Chri|stian Religion among such as haue it not, or to conserue it where it is already embraced, be greater, the care of all the Reformed Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> after a sorte lying vpon your Highnesse.

And which yet is most of all, hereunto is ioyned the puritie and integritie of your
<PB REF="8">
hands, whereby all things are ruled. Your Highnesse hath not liued like an <HI>Achab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to spoile any <HI>Naboth</HI> of his Vine|yard, nor like a <HI>Manasseh</HI> to de|file the streetes of your Cities with innocent blood. Nor like an <HI>Herod,</HI> to take the Wife of an other. Your Maiestie might shake the lappe with <HI>Nehemiah</HI> against oppressours, in signe and token of innocencie. Your Highnesse might cast the first stone at adulterers, &amp; in a good conscience could make purgati|on with <HI>Samuel,</HI> if so it were that your Highnesse came to bee iudged of man, <HI>Whose Oxe or Asse haue I taken, or to whome haue I done wrong,</HI> If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re be any fault (for the best want not their own blemishes) it is vpon that ex|tremity,
<PB REF="9">
which is neerest to ver|tue: Namely, in too great mer|cie and clemencie, which of old was noted for an infirmitie in good <HI>Theodosius, Quod ex man|suetudine in nimiam lenitatem de|clinauer&iuml;t,</HI> yet euen of this will I say with <HI>Nazian. Etiam haec est dei humanitas &amp; Clementia.</HI> This also is a resemblance of the cle|mencie of God, whose deputie on earth your Highnes are, for hee is gracious, slow to wrath, long suffering and ready to for|giue. Many a time he bends his bowe to shoote at the wicked, the arrowes of his anger, but is <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pisidae <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> slowe and loath to let them go: Yea, oftimes hee shoots &amp; purpose|ly misseth his marke, sparing yet for a time:
<PB REF="9">
<GAP DESC="foreign">, his warnings are many, but where they worke not, hee strikes at length, and no more but once. <GAP DESC="foreign">: Thus eue~ the Lord whose mer|cie is marueilous, meanes him to iudgement&punc; where mercie is abused: It is no pietie but su|perstition to spare, when time is to strike. And it is a cruell cle|mencie, which is declared vpon one with the destruction of ma|nie. The Pillars which vphold a Kingdome, are Mercie and Iu|stice, since by them Kinges are conserued, Your Highnesse out of your rare wisedome, will haue a care to conserue them both, that neither Mercie make preiudice to Iustice, nor Iustice againe take away the praise of Mercie.</P>
<P><PB REF="10">But to returne, as <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">desprima &amp; vita ima,</HI> are most vnseemely; so is the dignity doubled, where the preferment is beautified with pietie: and herein also hath the Lord magnified his mercie toward your Maiesty, that as by an high calling he hath exalted your Highnesse a Head &amp; Ru|ler ouer this Mightie people, so hath hee made your Highnesse no lesse eminent by communi|cation of his grace, then your Maiestie is by the Honor of the place, liuing in the eyes of all men a patterne of Vertue, yea an image of the heauenly King, walking so among the euill that you are not infected with their vice, and so with the good that the best are made better by your example. God make vs
<PB REF="10">
wise to know what wee haue, for because the Lord hath lo|ued his people, therefore hath hee set such a King ouer them, to rule them with equitie and righteousnesse. The Lord make vs thankefull for it, and long may your Highnes liue &amp; raign a happy king of many blessings to your people, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>Why, what meane you by that?</P>

<SP>

<P>Because many trauelled in these partes where you haue beene hauing returned worse then they went a field.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wherein worse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the botch of <HI>Aegypt</HI> in their bodie, the iust plague of God for corporall whoredome; and the leprosie of <HI>Babel</HI> in their soules, wherewith God also pu|nisheth the~ who loue not <HI>Sions</HI> beautie, and delight not in the light of the Gospell.</P>
</SP>

<P>You speake your pleasure there, for I see all is well as your selfe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would you did, for so you might easily see that <HI>Rome</HI> is Spirituall <HI>Aegypt,</HI> wherin the light of God is obscured: and <HI>Babel,</HI> wherein is a fearefull cap|tiuitie of Gods people, and such a horrible confusion of langua|ges, that when the Builder speaks, the people vnderstands not what he sayes: yea it is <HI>So|dom,</HI> which for her vile abhomi|nations will shortly bee burnt with fire, and brought to vtte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> desolation neuer to bee repai|red againe.</P>

<P>Let mee alone, I see you are stil in your old humour, and it maruels me much, that so ma|ny in this Land being conuer|ted to the bosome of the mo|ther Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> you should still continue in this new Hereticall opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>O now I see the bile of <HI>Ba|bel</HI> vpon you: you will call her a mother Church whom God cals a mother of Whoredomes, and you charge vs with nouel|tie, and heresie; but wee will proue by Gods grace, what you call heresie, and noueltie is veri|tie and antiquitie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Antiquitie say you, fie, speake neuer of it: for your el|dest Doctours are <HI>Luther,</HI> and <HI>Caluin.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay by your leaue <HI>(Sir)</HI>
<PB REF="13">
wee haue neither our faith from <HI>Luther,</HI> nor from <HI>Caluin</HI>: but an|swere you as the Apostle Saint <HI>Paul</HI> answered his aduersaries, when they charged him with the like crimes that you charge vs with, and I pray you marke his Apologie:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 24.14.</NOTE> <HI>I confesse that af|ter the way which they call Heresie, so worship I the Lord God of my Fathers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What euer Saint <HI>Paul</HI> speakes, I would not haue you speaking of Fathers, seeing you haue forsaken the Religion of your Fathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You deceiue your selfe if you thinke wee wil not stand to the Religion of our Fathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, but your Fathers were Papists.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay but our Fathers were Protestants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="14">
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now in good faith you moue me to laughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may laugh as you list, but haue no cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>VVas not your Father, and Grandfather, and their Fa|thers before them for many a|ges Papists?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>What of that? they who in regard of time and truth were long before them, and should be followed as Fathers to vs and them both, were Protestants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is but a shift of your owne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is no shift, it is a truth; and you shall see it your selfe if you will consider who were <HI>Pauls</HI> Fathers, whom he saies he followed in the worshipping of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>What were the names of
<PB REF="14">
his Fathers were I cannot tell, but I see they haue been <HI>Israelites</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Beniamin.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>We haue not that to stand vpon, what they were for their persons, or names either, but what was their Religion: re|member you not that hee sayes himselfe, he was brought vp at the feet of <HI>Gamali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea I doe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell mee now of what Religion was <HI>Gamali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see he hath been a Pha|resie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>And think you that Saint <HI>Paul</HI> when hee made his Apolo|gie, worshipped God after the manner of Pharesies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thinke it not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then sayes hee, that he worshipped God after the
<PB REF="15">
maner of his Fathers, seeing his Fathers were Pharesies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thinke he meanes not of these fathers, who liued last be|fore him, but transcending them he passes vp to his elder fathers <HI>Abraham, Isaack, Iacob.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was hee not then wrong|fully accused of noueltie, as one who had forsaken the religion of his fathers, because hee for|sooke the Religion of such Fa|thers as liued last before him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thinke so indeede: His Apologie cleares him sufficient|ly both of heresie and noueltie, which his aduersaries would haue imputed to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now <HI>(Sir)</HI> I haue you where I would: why should not the like Apologie cleare vs in the like case: for albeit we haue
<PB REF="15">
foresaken the heresies of Papi|strie maintained by them, that liued last before vs, yet doe wee worship the Lord our God, as these fathers did, whom <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, <HI>Patres Patrum,</HI> &amp; whom with him we will prefer to any posterior fathers what|soeuer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>That cannot be, seeing it is known, it is not threescore yeers since your Religion came into this Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>(Sir)</HI> I will make known to you, that it is 1500 yeeres since this same Religion prea|ched and professed now, was then preached and professed by our Ancient fathers. The first Religion that euer we had was gentilisme, our fathers worship|ped <HI>Diana,</HI> the Sun, the Moone, the Starres.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="16">

<P>So it was indeed: but in the first hundreth yeere we em|braced Christianity, and eight hundreth yeere after Christ, we were infected with Papistrie, and now againe hath God called vs by the light of the gospel to our ancient Religion of Christiani|ty, whereby wee worshippe the Father in his sonne according to his word, and no other way.</P>

<P>What is that to the mat|ter? Seeing the truth where|by we condemne these corrup|tions will be found elder then they, and wee, to speake with <HI>Vincentius,</HI> wil euer preferre the olde Faith to new vnfaithful|nesse: for if you thinke this a

good Argument: Such a do|ctrine or ceremonie should be receiued, because it is one thousand and two hundred yeares old, then by the same reason the heresies of <HI>Simon Magus</HI> must bee receiued for a truth, because they were taught by him one thousand and sixe hundred yeares since.</P>

<P>Will you goe vp to the Church in <HI>Paradise,</HI> and you shall see the first voice that sounded there was Gods voice: For in the first two Chapters of <HI>Genesis,</HI> you will heare nothing but <HI>Deus dixit,</HI> God said: but in|continent in the third Chapter comes in, <HI>Et Serpens dixit,</HI> and the Serpent said.</P>

<P>No such Lawes as dero|gate to Christs Lawes, for in that sense you heard <HI>Vincentius</HI> denie that they are Law-ma|kers, but Law-keepers: I pray you giue place to the truth, and consider how little cause they haue to bragge of Antiquitie, who dare make the like of that; Albeit Christ and his Apostles, and the Primitiue Church did this, yet we for good causes will doe oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rwayes.</P>

<P>And so I wish from my heart it may be: But I pray you consider as in one Sacrament you are guiltie of sacrilegious paring, so in both you are guil|tie of sacrilegious adding and changing: and so cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">schew

<P>Why then, since it is trea|son to pare, or adde any thing to the forme of the Princes Sig|net, is it not Sacrilegious bold|ness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to pare or adde to Christs Sacrament? But least you should thinke the controuersi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> onely to bee about these things, you shall know that, except the Ar|ticle of the Trinitie, the Church of Rome hath left no Article of our Faith vncorrupted, so that it is most certaine, This Church of Rome with the do|ctrine, and iurisdiction nowe maintained by her, was not in the Primitiue Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>O but I wil tell you what I once heard concerning that matter, from one of their Do|ctors: <HI>That there is a great diffe|rence
<PB N="22" REF="29">
betweene a Church in her in|fancie, and her older and riper age:</HI> For as it growes in age, so may it and should it increase in many things which it had not in the infancie thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nowe I see you speake from such knowledge, as the great labours of the <HI>Iesuites</HI> workes in the hearts of their captiues, and because it is your last and greatest defence, I will let you still see out of the words of <HI>Vincentius,</HI> which you will like better then mine, that this makes nothing for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come on let vs see; what sayes <HI>Vincentius?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>He grants, <HI>There should be an encr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ase in Faith, but not a change of Faith.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a strange distincti|on,
<PB N="23" REF="29">
and yet so honest, that in truth I dare not gaine-say it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heare him then; hee ex|pounds the two parts of his di|stinction: <HI>To encrease</HI> (saith he) <HI>is when a thing biding in it selfe is more amplified: To change, is when a thing going out of it selfe is tran|slated &amp; turned into an other.</HI> To make this cleare, hee illustrates it by a proper similitude: <HI>Let</HI> (sayes hee) <HI>the Religion of soules follow the nature of bodies, which albe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in processe of yeres they grow, yet they remaine the same: the same members, the same Ioyntes are in Children which are in Men, though in the one stronger and greater, in the other smaller and weaker: but if the shape bee turned in any forme not of the owne kind, or any thing bee eked to the num|ber
<PB N="24" REF="30">
of the members, or taken from the same, then either the body pe|risheth, or becomes monstrous, or at the least becomes weake. So in Religion, if wee shall begin to mixe noueltie with Antiquitie, we shall make the Church a brothell of fil|thie and abominable errours, which before was a Temple of chaste and vndefiled veritie, where as the Church of Christ should bee a dili|gent keeper of the doctrine deliue|red to it, changing nothing, dimi|nishing nothing, adding nothing.</HI> Now these are the words of <HI>Vincentius,</HI> and I demand of you out of the light of your consci|ence if you can gaine-say them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>In truth it is a pretie dis|course, and I embrace all that he hath said as a truth.</P>

<PB N="25" REF="30">
what yee wil say for the Church of Rome, since it can not bee denied they haue changed, di|minished, and added to the an|cient Catholicke faith: Some ceremonies and opinions they haue which Antiquitie knewe not, &amp; some the ancient Church had, which they haue pared a|way, and in a word haue so change, that in Rome is no|thing anci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt but the name.</P>

<P>I know not what that is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will tell you: Twelue hundreth yeares after Christ, <HI>Gratian</HI> a Benedictine Monke, gathered together the sentences of Councels, Fathers, and Popes, concerning sundrie matters of Religion, and set it forth, which is commonly cal|led <HI>Decretum</HI>; and after him cer|tain Popes, as <HI>Gregory</HI> the ninth, <HI>Boniface</HI> the eight, <HI>Clemens</HI> the fift, <HI>Iohn</HI> the twentie two, fol|lowing

<P>In truth I can not iudge of that which I know not.</P>

<P>I will giue you but one Decrete of this law, and let you see how it strikes the Apostle S. <HI>Paul</HI> in the teeth, that by it you may iudge of the rest.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caus.</HI> 26. <HI>quaest.</HI> 2. <HI>&amp; Caus.</HI> 31. <HI>qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>Secundam accipere vxorem secund&ugrave;m Apo|stoli praeceptum licitum est; secun|dum

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>_WHat say you to day <HI>(Sir)</HI> haue you considered the points of our last conference?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="36">
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea I haue beene (as I may) thinking vpon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? Is not your heart mooued to come to vs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find it mooued, but not remooued from the Church of Rome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell mee (I pray you) what is that which holdes you from vs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>To bee plaine with you, since the Church of Rome is your mother Church, you can with no good conscience for|sake her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that be all your scruple, I hope to resolue you: for this day by Gods grace I will shewe that we of this Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI> had neuer our faith from the Church of Rome; yea that in her best estate shee was no
<PB N="37" REF="36">
more but a sister Church vnto vs. The next day God willing I wil shew you that the Church of Rome is Apostatique now, not like that Church of olde, which the Apostle commen|ded, and is not onely a Whoore her selfe, but the mother of Whooredomes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>You haue taken much in hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more then by Gods grace I hope to qualifie, if you wil with patience heare me, and interrupt me not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speake as long as you please, I shall heare you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>(Sir)</HI> I will be loath to burden you with multitude of words, but shall bee very well content, when you heare any point wherein weight is, that
<PB N="38" REF="37">
you warne me to cleare it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I shall doe so God willing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then first I will saye, Rome hath beene no mother Church, neither to the Chur|ches of <HI>Asia:</HI> these were planted by Apostles and Apostolicke men; Nor yet to the Churches of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ricke:</HI> Christianity was first conueied to them by <HI>Marke</HI> the Euangelist, and the <HI>Eunuch</HI> of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> whom <HI>Philip</HI> baptised: And I can let you see (but that I shall disgresse ouer farre) that fiue hu~dreth yeres after Christ the Churches of <HI>Africke</HI> would not acknowledge the Bishop of Rome their superiour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our question is not now concerning them: for I knowe the Church of Rome receiued
<PB N="39" REF="37">
her faith from the Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> and they of <HI>Asia</HI> recei|ued it not from the Church of Rome. And as to them of <HI>A|fricke,</HI> whatsoeuer is disputable, there wee leaue it as not pertai|ning to our present puropse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh good <HI>Sir,</HI> you will grant then that the Church of Rome is farre posterior to the Churches of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia,</HI> and, if it bee compared with them, is but a daughter Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can not denie: But the Churches of <HI>Europe,</HI> and specially these of the west parts were first conuerted to Christ by the Church of Rome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>(Sir)</HI> yee are decei|ued in that also, and this is the point wherein I am to contra|dict you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="38">
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure you will not contradict mee, without some warrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>That were no reason: I will let you see that the most fa|mous Churches of <HI>Europe</HI> (as their Records testifie) had not their faith from the Church of Rome, and then I will come to our owne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think long to heare that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I will delay you no longer. In the Councel of <HI>Trent,</HI> there was a great question be|tweene the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Prelates, about the first place: The greatest Argument that a|ny of them vsed, was from the Antiquitie of their Christiani|tie, which none of them allead|ged, they had from the Church of Rome, albeit at that time
<PB N="41" REF="38">
both of them sought the Popes fauour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>From whence got they it then, if they got it not from Rome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> alleadged, they were made Christians by Saint <HI>Iames,</HI> who after hee had Preached the Gospell in <HI>Spaine,</HI> returned to <HI>Palestina,</HI> and was president of that famous Coun|cell holden at Ierusalem, <HI>Act.</HI> 15 then being Martyred, his bones were brought to <HI>Compostella,</HI> and there buried. The <HI>French</HI> replied that their narration was fabulous, and that it is more likely, if any Apostle came to <HI>Spaine,</HI> hee came rather by land to <HI>France,</HI> and so taught them by the way, then otherwise by Sea: And if any credit might be
<PB N="42" REF="39">
giuen to such traditions, they could also with more probabi|litie alledge that <HI>Lazarus,</HI> and <HI>Nathaniel</HI> taught the Gospell a|mong them&punc; &amp; this at that time they spake for themselues.

<P>What would you make of all that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Let it be so.</P>

<P>Then I pray you consi|der, that the Church of this Land, being little posterior in time to the Church of Rome, there is no reason they should beare vs downe with the sha|dow of their Antiquitie, nor in|sult ouer vs, as if they were a mother Church to vs, seeing it pleased God to conuert vs to the Christian faith, almost as soone as themselues, and that not by them but by others whom he sent among vs.</P>

<P>But to returne. Vnder <HI>Dio|cletian</HI> in the three hundreth yeare, great persecution was made by that Tyrant in al Chri|stian Churches, and among the rest the Church of South <HI>Bri|taine</HI> was also persecuted by his Deputies, for the which many fled to <HI>Crachlint</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> who did louingly receiue them, and assigned to them the Isle of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> and erected there a Tem|ple dedicated to Christ called o|therwise <HI>Sodo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e~sis ecclesia,</HI> wher|in they peaceably worshipped

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember you not what
<PB N="60" REF="48">
I haue prooued; seeing wee are but three yeares in Christiani|tie behinde Rome, thinke you in so small time they did so en|crease, that they spread out their branches to the vttermost parts of the earth? Yea, rather if you will reade the Storie, you shall finde that for three hundreth yeares (wherein are many three yeares) they were so vexed by the persecutors, that they could not get their owne Church sta|blished; as after it was when God relented the persecution. But to come n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erer yet vnto you; whether hee was an Apo|stle or an Apostolicke man, that first planted our Church, I will giue you two great reasons that wee haue our Faith from the <HI>Greeke</HI> or East Churches, not

fro~ the <HI>Latine</HI> or West Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nowe that is the point, and I pray you once cleare it: for I thinke if you euince that, the Church of Rome in her best estate hath beene vnto vs a sister Church, but no mother church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>My first Argument is from <HI>Petrus Cluniacensis Abbas,</HI> writing to <HI>Bernard,</HI> who affirmes that for seuen or eight hundred yeares after Christ, the <HI>Scottish|men did celebra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the Passeouer all this time after the Grecian maner, not aster the Romane.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vnderstand not that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will tell you it. Soone after the dayes of the A|postles, there happened a con|trouersie betweene the Chur|ches of the East and West, a|bout the celebration of the
<PB N="62" REF="49">
Passeouer: They of the East did obserue it the fourteenth day of the Moone, that same day wherein the <HI>Iewes</HI> kept their Passeouer: They againe of the West, thinking they would haue no communion with the <HI>Iewes,</HI> did celebrate it the next Sabboth after the fourteenth day. <HI>Pol&iuml;crates,</HI> with the orien|tall Bishops, alledged the au|thoritie of <HI>Iohn, Philip, Policarp,</HI> yea the prescript of the Euan|gell for their warrant. <HI>Victor,</HI> and the Bishops of the West al|ledged for their warrant, Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> Saint <HI>Paul:</HI> Such as were more moderate, misliked to see a Schisme in the Church for so small a matter: <HI>Irenaeus</HI> iudgeth, <HI>Obseruationes ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s esse liber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</HI> So|crates, <HI>Ostendit nec Victorem, nec

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truely it was a lamenta|ble thing, to see so sore a renting of the Church, for so small a cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was indeede: and yet that in this controuersie, the Churches of <HI>Britaine</HI> obserued the manner of the Easterne Church, it is an argument they reuerenced the East Church for their mother, from whome the grace of the Gospell had come to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeede likely: If
<PB N="64" REF="50">
these Churches had beene plan|ted by Romish Doctors, they would haue also receiued the Romish ceremonies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there is yet an other Argument:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Histor.

<PB N="65" REF="50">
Romish ceremonies, which to that day they had not knowne; as Altars, Images, Vestiments; Crosses, wherein albeit hee had not such speedie successe as hee would, yet at length did he ob|taine it, and intended also to ef|fect the like in the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cent.</HI> 6. <HI>li.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 17.</NOTE> but was strongly resi|sted by <HI>Daganus,</HI> and <HI>Columbanus, Qui nullam in ritibus mutationem admittere voluerunt.</HI> Againe in the seuen hundreth yeare a great schisme was in the church of <HI>Britaine:</HI> some refusing the Ceremonies of the Romish Church, keeping still their an|cient custome; for the which they pretended the authoritie of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> the Evangelist: O|thers againe embracing the Ro|mish ceremonies&punc; which part
<PB N="66" REF="51">
waxed the stronger, in that King <HI>Osuvius</HI> inclined to them. Al|way the matter was debated with so hot contention, that from words it came to wepons, and twelue hundreth Church-men were slain that refused the Romish Ceremonies: this is all the good the <HI>Britaine</HI> Church got from the Popes Legate; yet the euill rested not heere, for at length in the eight hundreth yeare, by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> perswasion of one <HI>Ecbertus,</HI> this part of the Isle was also induced to receiue the Ro|mish Ceremonies, and thereaf|ter their corrupt doctrine.

this discourse which truely I haue made vnto you, it may be evident how vainely and with|out a cause the defenders of the Romish Church brag of their ancient Primacie ouer all Chur|ches, and specially how far they wrong this Isle, when they will haue <HI>Rome</HI> caled a mother to the Churches here: which vnlesse you will adde one syllable can|not be admitted, for indeed she is a <HI>Stepmother,</HI> and in a word that <HI>Infamous Whoore of Babel,</HI> who as shee hath corrupted the Churches with her abhomina|ble Superstitions, no maruell if shee hath at length infected vs also.

<P>I hope you shall thinke much more before you goe: for now I will improue their distin|ction, and let you see it is not Ethnique <HI>Rome</HI> vnder Empe|rours, nor the Towne of <HI>Rome</HI> in the last time of the World, that here is called <HI>Babel</HI> but the

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is euident S. <HI>Iohn</HI> pro|phecies of the state of Rome as it will bee in the dayes of Anti|christ, so sayes the Iesuite <HI>Viega&punc; Haec est quarta visio huius operis; ea&abque; illustrissima, &amp; ad Antichristi tempora pertinens.</HI> So also sayes the Iesuite <HI>Ribera,</HI> a ca. 12. ad 21. <HI>Est huius libri pars secunda, &amp; iota ad Antichristum, eius&abque; tempora pertinet.</HI> But the dayes of per|secuting Emperours, were not the dayes of Antichrist: if they
<PB N="81" REF="58">
so say, they destroy all their owne doctrine concerning An|tichrist, and therefore this pro|phecie of <HI>Babel,</HI> is not to bee vn|derstood of the Ethnicke <HI>Rome</HI> vnder Emperours. Secondly, Ethnicke <HI>Rome</HI> as yet had not embraced the Gospell, and was not married with Christ, and therefore cannot be this <HI>Whore,</HI> which <HI>Carthusian</HI> their owne man expounds to be <HI>An adulter|ous Whore</HI>: You shall finde no people in holy Scripture char|ged with spirituall Whoredom, but such as haue beene married with Christ, none can bee Apo|states from the faith, who neuer stoode in the faith, there must bee <GAP DESC="foreign"> before <GAP DESC="foreign">. This whoorish <HI>Babel</HI> then can not be Ethnicke <HI>Rome,</HI> vnmarried with
<PB N="82" REF="59">
Christ. Seeing themselues doe grant it is Rome, it must bee <HI>Rome</HI> once Christian, but now corrupted: once Apostolicke standing in the faith, now Apo|stati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke fallen from the faith. Thirdly, this Whore of <HI>Babel</HI> hath a cup in her hand full of a|bominations, and the filthines of her fornication<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, wherewith shee makes drunken the inhabi|tants of the earth. By this gol|den cup <HI>Berengandus</HI> their owne man vnderstands, <HI>Documenta er|roribus plena:</HI> And so this <HI>Babel</HI> can not signifie <HI>Rome</HI> vnder Em|perors, who subdued the world by force of Sword and plaine vi|olence, but must signifie <HI>Rome</HI> vnder Popes, which hath decei|ued the world by false doctrine and lying myracles. Fourthly,
<PB N="83" REF="59">
this <HI>Babel</HI> is called the mother of Whoredomes and abominati|ons in the earth, which not one|ly her selfe hath played the Whoore, corrupting the true worship of God, but hath in|forced her corruptions and su|perstitions vpon oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs. Now it is knowne that olde <HI>Rome</HI> sought no more but subiection of bodies, leauing the conscien|ces of people free to any kind of worshippe they pleased: They subdued the <HI>Iewes,</HI> and forced them to pay tribute; but left them to their owne Religion: yea so farre were they from in|forcing their superstitious wor|ship vpon any nation, that by the contrarie themselues were infected with the superstitions of all nations, as is euident by
<PB N="84" REF="60">
their <HI>Pantheon,</HI> which they ere|cted in the honour of all Gods. And so it is not Ethnicke <HI>Rome</HI> vnder Emperours which heere is called the <HI>Mother of whoredomes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carthus.</HI></NOTE> Fiftly, the name of this <HI>Babel</HI> is <HI>mysterium, in quo a|liud cernitur, aliud intelligitur: Quia enim tot simulatis virtuti|bus decoratur, non omnibus mulie|ris huius prauatas innotescet, sed viris ius<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is &amp; prudentibus.</HI> So then by this <HI>Babel,</HI> some mysti|call enemie is vnderstood, being indeede an enemie, but in shew pretending friendship: and ther|fore called afterward <HI>Gog,</HI> and not <HI>Magog,</HI> that is, not an open and plain enemy, as is the <HI>Turke:</HI> But <HI>Gog,</HI> a couered enemie: for this cause figured also before by a beast with two hornes, loo|king
<PB N="85" REF="60">
like a Lambe, but speaking like the Dragon. To this pur|pose sayes IEROME,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Daniel.</HI> 11.</NOTE> <HI>Simulabit se ducem faederis:</HI> And <HI>Hilarius, that Antichrist shall bee contrarie to Christ, vnder a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orme of fained and hypocriticall godlinesse.</HI> And <HI>Chrysostome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Matth. Hom.</HI> 49.</NOTE> <HI>Antichrist must bee knowne by his doctrine, not by his titles, miracles, nor words of god|linesse.</HI> And therefore it is a sil|ly defence of the <HI>Iesuites:</HI> The Pope (say they) prayers humb|ly to God, and calles himselfe <HI>seruus seruorum Dei,</HI> therefore is not an aduersarie: for the Que|stion is not what he calles him|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lfe, but what hee is. But to hold vpon this point, it is eui|dent by what which I haue said, that by <HI>Babel</HI> here is not meant <HI>Rome</HI> Ethnicke, nor yet <HI>Rome</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="61">
which at the last shall rebell (for both these are open enemies) but <HI>Rome</HI> vnder Popes, a mysti|call enemie. Sixthly, in this <HI>Re|uelation,</HI> there are two women described; the one <HI>Chap.</HI> 12. clo|thed with the Sunne, which is CHRIST, hauing on her head twelue Starres for a Garland, (the glorie of the true Church is the doctrine of the twelue A|postles) and vnder her feete the Moone, figuring this mutable world: This woman (as them|selues confesse) represents the true Church.

many louers to her. Now (I say) seeing the first woman sig|nifies the true Church (as them|selues confesse) and afterward is called the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbes wife,</HI> why doe they not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee that this who|rish woman must signifie the false Church?

<P>I am not to iudge of mens persons: many are called Papists who know not what Papistrie meanes, and many liue Papists who dare not die Papists, or if so they doe, they know not what they doe.

<P>Let mee heare it I pray you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I read that a certaine Duke of <HI>Frisland</HI> named <HI>Raboldus,</HI> a|bout the yeare of our LORD nine hundreth, being perswaded (as hee pretended) to embrace Christianitie, as he went to bee baptized and had the one of his feet in the water, he demanded of the Bishops <HI>If all his Forefa|thers were damned?</HI> the Bishops

answered more rashly then wisely, they were all damned: whereupon the Duke pulled backe his feete againe, saying, <HI>Then I will also bee damned with them.</HI> Thinke you this a good answere?</P>

<SP>

<P>No indeede I thinke it a mad answere.</P>

<P>Yet the same is the poy|son wherewith your <HI>Iesuits</HI> sub|tilly infect the hearts of simple ones, that they should rather choose to be damned with their Fathers th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n saued without them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>But will you say to vs as these Bishops said to him, <HI>That all our Fathers are damned?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay that wil I not; iudge|ment of election and reproba|tion pertaines to the Lord, their

persons I leaue: but the doctrine of Papistrie I am sure is deadly, and bringes damnation to the soules of men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you will not giue iudgment of their persons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed: for, as to their persons&punc; I know many this day are so called, who know not the Doctrine of Papistrie; and, as to them who haue liued before vs, howsoeuer in their life they professed Papistrie, yet in their death they were forced to seeke comfort in our Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is strange that you will say many of our Fathers died in your Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet it is true, as I will let you see by a little forme of visi|tation of the sicke, vsed at that time when Antichrists darke|nesse
<PB N="139" REF="88">
was greatest, to wit, in the eleuenth hundred yeare, for so the Church-men spake to the sicke: <HI>Fateris te <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am mal&egrave; vixisse vt meritis tuis pae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> aeterna <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ebe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tur</HI>?

</SP>
<SP>

thinke Papistry now tolerable in the dayes of light, as it was in the dayes of darkenesse: it was a fault then, for euen the serua~t who knowes not his Masters will shall be stricken; but it is a double fault now, for hee, who knowes his Masters will, and does the contrary, shall haue double s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ripes.</P>

<P>And yet whatsoeuer I haue said concerning the per|sons

of Papists, there is further to bee saide of Papistrie it selfe: that it is a doctrine so full of he|resies, so directly contrary to the doctrine of the Gospell, that I dare say, a man beleeuing all the points of Papistrie, and per|seuering in them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the end without repentance cannot bee saued.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Now that is the point, &amp; I pray you make it cleare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is cleare by these places following, which will shew you that Papistrie is a doctrine of Diuels, a plague of God, and a iust punishment laied on repro|bate men for their sinnes, and a forerunner of the wrath to come.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

</SP>

<P>This is yet further cleared by <HI>Augustine,</HI> who expounding that place of the Apostle 2. <HI>Thes.</HI> 2. <HI>Adoccultu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Dei iudicium per|tinet qu&ograve;d impij ab Antichristo feducuntur:</HI> It pertaines to Gods secret iudgement that the wic|ked are seduced by Antichrist: <HI>Seducentur qui seduci merebuntur, pro eo qu&ograve;d dilectionem veritatis non receperunt.</HI> They shall bee deceiued who haue deserued to bee deceiued, because they re|ceiue not the loue of the truth: and yet more feareful is the sen|tence, which he subioynes, <HI>Iu|dicati seducentur, &amp; seducti iudi|cabuntur:</HI> when they are iudged they shall be deceiued, and be+cause they were deceiued they

<P>Amen: But now I remem|ber, I promised before to de|clare vnto you, that Papistrie impugnes both the Person and offices of Christ, and so in effect denies that Iesus the Sonne of <HI>Marie</HI> is the Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is most strange.</P>

<SP>

<P>It is indeede, and yet it is true, as you shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> perceiue if you

goe through the principall Ar|ticles of our faith. And first to begin at Christ person, that of many wee may touch a few, <HI>We beleeue that Iesus Christ is both God and man.</HI></P>

<P>And who denies that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You know that old <HI>Ar|riu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> denied his Diuinitie, and now Papistes denie his huma|nitie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you say that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because they worshippe and adore a Christ, who is not come in the flesh: To cleare this, I pray you consider that Canon of the Apostles, 1. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4. <HI>Beloved, beleeue not euery spirit, but trie the spirits if they be of God: because many false Prophets are gone out into the World. In this the spirit of God is knowne; Euerie

<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it be so: What is that against Papists?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, it is against them di|rectly, for the word teacheth vs to worship Christ, <HI>Conceiued of the holy Ghost, horne of the Virgine Marie:</HI> But they worshippe Christ created by a Priest, not conceiued by the holy Ghost; a Christ whose fleshe is made of Breade by <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> whereby they destroy the Arti|cle of his <HI>Incarnation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they say it is the same Christ who was borne of the Virgin <HI>Marie.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="158" REF="98">
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it bee the same Christ, then must they grant that his flesh is not created of bread: for that Christ borne of the Virgin <HI>Marie</HI> was made flesh of the seed of <HI>Dauid</HI> by the operation of the Holy Ghost, but this Christ whom they worship in the Masse hath his flesh made of bread by Transubstantiation, and they are not ashamed to call their Priest for this worke <HI>Creatorem sui Creatoris,</HI> a Crea|tour of his Creatour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>But saith not our Lord that the <HI>Bread</HI> giuen in the Sa|crament is <HI>his Bodie?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea indeede, and so wee beleeue it is: for it is no naked nor common bread that hoe giues vs there the giuing of that bread, It is <GAP DESC="foreign">, the

<P>But if it bee Bread, how can it be his body?</P>

<P>It is needlesse to demaund how? Since he hath said it; but I beleeue it is his body.</P>

<P>I dare not say so.</P>
</SP>

<P>And you haue reason: The Papists charge vs that wee denie Gods omnipotencie, but the fault is theirs; they denie his omnipotencie, when they say hee can not giue vs his body

in the Sacrament, except hee make his body of bread. Doe they not here limit the Lord?</P>

<P>You may ioyne to this another testimonie of the Apo|stle <HI>Hebrewes</HI> 13. <HI>Iesus Christ ye|sterday, this day, and the same for euer.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will that make a|gainst them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they are blinde to worship a Christ this daie, who was not a Christ yesterday: for
<PB N="161" REF="99">
you know they grant them|selues that before consecration the bread is not Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you may perceiue it is but an artificiall Christ made by man whom they worshippe, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he true Christ. Thus you see how they are iniurious to his person, for the which cause I said to you, that Papists by necessitie of consequence, denie Iesus the sonne of <HI>Marie</HI> to bee the Christ. Now to his Offices, they are all comprised vnder the name <HI>Christ,</HI> for he is the <HI>anoynted</HI> King, Prophet, and Priest of his Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they will grant all that vnto you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know in word they will, but in effect they take his Of|fices
<PB N="162" REF="100">
from him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall see how: what thinke you is the office of a Pro|phet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>To teach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say verie well, and for this cause Christ is called <HI>the great Prophet raised vp among his brethren: And the great Angell of the counsell of God,</HI> who came into the World to reueile per|fectly vnto the Church the will of God concerning mans salua|tion, and Gods worship: so that now once for all God hath spo|ken to vs in these last dayes by his sonne, and we haue not to expect from any other any fur|ther declaration of his will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thinke no man wil denie that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="163" REF="100">
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall heare how it is denied, if first I make the point more clear vnto you: you know that the father proclaimed from Heauen, first at <HI>Iordan,</HI> then at mount <HI>Tabor, This is my welbelo|ued sonne in whom I am well plea|sed, heare him.</HI> See you not here how we are plainly commaun|ded to learne Gods will concer|ning our Saluation from the Sonne?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea I see that, and it is good reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then if you will come and heare what the Son saies, you shal see that as the Father sends vs to the Sonne, so the Sonne sends vs to the Scriptures: if we would haue eternall life <HI>search the Scriptures,</HI> and he witnesseth plainely <HI>Iohn</HI> 17.8. <HI>The wordes
<PB N="164" REF="101">
which thou gauest mee, I gaue them,</HI> meaning to his Disciples. Where againe if you looke to the Disciples words: <HI>The Scrip|ture</HI> (sayes Saint <HI>Paul) is able to make the man of God perfect,</HI> and therefore hee protests <HI>Act.</HI> 20 that he taught nothing but <HI>Mo|ses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and yet that hee had deliuered to them the whole counsell of God. See you what a comfortable harmonie is here: The Father bids vs heare the Sonne; the Sonne protests the wordes the Father gaue him, hee gaue to his Dis|ciples; and both of them sends vs to the Scripture, as contei|ning the whole counsell of God concerning our Saluation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see all that clearly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what spirit are they
<PB N="165" REF="101">
led with that dare say, <HI>It had beene good for the Church the Scripture had neuer beene.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who dare say that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I haue heard with mine eares defenders of Papistrie say it: and the positions of their owne Doctors no lesse blasphe|mous are extant to bee seene: <HI>Lectio Scripturae non, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant&ugrave;m est invtilis, sed pernitio samultis mo|dis</HI>; the reading of Holy Scrip|ture is not only vnprofitable; but pernicious. And therefore they wil not let the people read nor serch the Scripture, though Christ commanded: so to do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: and instoade of Scripture they intrude on the Church their owne decrees, and other tradi|tions, which they make of equal authoritie with the Scripture.
<PB N="166" REF="102">
Thus you see how they take a|way Christs Propheticall office. Now to come to his Priestly of|fice: you know the Priests office was twofold, first hee ought to sacrifice for the people, &amp; next to pray for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they acknowledge both these, that Christ hath of|fered himselfe in a propitiatory sacrifice for our sinnes, and that hee still makes intercession for v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in heauen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, but they so acknowledge it, that in both these offices they ioyne others with Christ, and so make him not a full and per|fect Sauiour of his people by himselfe, but a halfe-Sauiour in part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vnterstand not that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall make it cleare to

you. There is the testimony of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Word concerning the suffi|ciency of the merite of Christs bloud. <HI>The bloud of Christ his sonne clenseth vs from all sinne,</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will not be against that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they are when they make this distinction, that <HI>prin|cipally</HI> Christs bloud clenseth from sinne&punc; but <HI>secondarily</HI> there must be other things with it to clens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sinne: as works of satis|faction in this life, and fire of Purgatorie in the life to come.

<P>The first is <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.3. <HI>That Christ by himselfe hath made pur|gation of our sinnes.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will you gather of that place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>A most necessary obserua|tion for clearing this contro|uersie, to wit, that the purging power of sinne is person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll to Christ, he hath done it, by him|selfe&punc; the vertue and benef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hee communicates to others that repent and belieue, bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e meriting power, by which God is reconciled&punc; and his iust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sa|tisfied, he transfers not, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ither to any mans person nor any o|ther thing beside.</P>

<PB N="169" REF="103">
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, according to my vnderstanding that is a truth, wherin euery Christian should rest, for it is most comfortable to the conscience, since wee are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, neith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r in whole nor in part to satisfie for our owne sinnes.</P>

<SP>

<P>It is so indeed, and that you may bee the more confir|med, will you looke how the Iesuites who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the light, be|cause it conuinceth them of darkenesse, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">translating this place, leaue out t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is word <HI>By him self<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>: they, say he makes purga|tion of sinnes, but passe by this word, <HI>by himself,</HI> looke you their owne translation.</P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea forsooth if you can read it, these are the words, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>In truth this one place makes all their doctrine, con|cerning the supplement of Christs merits, iustly to be su|spected: for since he hath made the purgation of our sinnes by himselfe, what should we looke that they are to bee purged by any other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You reason well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I speake as I think: it is ei|ther pittiful ignora~ce, that they see not the truth, or their wilful malice that they dare mutilate so cleare a place of holy Scrip|ture, leauing it out of their Bi|ble, because it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">akes against t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e~.</P>

the other testimony of holy Scripture, whereof I spake. you haue it <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. <HI>ver.</HI> 25. <HI>Christ is a|ble to saue perfectly (<GAP DESC="foreign">) all that come vnto God by him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see that is also a com|fortable place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is indeed: for as the first makes you see that Christs meriting power is personall, &amp; in himselfe, not transf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rred to any other&punc; so this makes you see it is perfect: hee hath done the worke of our saluation in his owne person, and hee hath done it perfectly: What more can you craue?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I craue no more.</P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away then with these rotten dregges of Papistrie, that teach vs to depend vpon other merites, &amp; vpon an other bloud

(as I shewed you the first day) besides the merits of the bloud of Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my own part I think neuer to leane to them, but will rest vpon that onely perfect sa|crifice of Christ offered on the Crosse for my sinnes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you abide there, you are vpon the sure foundation; and remember you must renounce all other sacrifices, which dero|gate from the perfection &amp; suf|ficiency of that one sacrifice of Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will indeed&punc;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then for your confirma|tion marke these places. <HI>Christ in the end of the world hath ap|peared once to put away sinne by the sacrif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e of himselfe. Heb.</HI> 9.26. <HI>Christ was once offered to take

away the sins of many, Heb.</HI> 9.28. <HI>Wee are sanctified by the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once, Heb.</HI> 10.10. <HI>This man after he had offe|red one sacrifice for sinnes, sits for+euer at the right hand of God. Heb.</HI> 10.12. <HI>With one offering hath he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onsecrated for euer them that are sanctified. Heb.</HI> 10.14. <HI>where re|mission of sinnes is, there is no more offering for sin, Heb.</HI> 10.18. <HI>Christ needed not daily (as these high Priests) to offer vp sacrifice, first for his owne sinnes, and then for the peoples: for that did hee once, when he offered vp himselfe, Heb.</HI> 7.27. <HI>without shedding of blood, is no re|mission. Heb.</HI> 9.22. Perceiue you not here that the Apostle repea|ting this so oft, that Christ was <HI>once</HI> offered, for taking away our sinnes, destroyeth all other pre|tended
<PB N="174" REF="106">
sacrifices for sinne, and specially that sacrifice of the Masse, which they say is a pro|pitiatorie sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truely the places are so plaine, that very children may vnderstand them, and I would God that these poore people, who of a blind mind dote after Masses, thinking by it to gette the pardon of their sinnes, had this benefite of Gods word, as you haue it, that so by the light of it they might come to the knowledge of the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I wish the same from my heart, But now to confirm you yet further, I pray you mark how blasphemous and deceit|full a thing their Masse is. First, is not this a mockerie of GOD
<PB N="175" REF="106">
the Father, To desire him to accept his owne Sonne: Is Christ out of the fauour of his Father? said he not; <HI>He is my Son in whom I am well pleased?</HI> shall a mortal &amp; miserable sinful Priest be a Mediatour, or Peacemaker betweene the Father and the Sonne, praying the Father that he would accept his Sonne, and send downe an Angell to take vp his bodie into Heauen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie vpon it: It is a vile blasphemie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly, see you not how it inverts Gods ordinance? for where hee hath ordained a Sacrament, wherein God offers and giues his Sonne to vs; they haue changed it into a sacrifice, wherein they offer vp the Son to the Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="176" REF="107">
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see that also&punc;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thirdly, Is it not an iniu+rious thing to Christ, to say that any can offer him vp to God, but himselfe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de: for as no o|ther Sacrifice can satisfie Gods iustice, so no other sacrificer can bee worthie to offer him but himselfe, as is cleare out of your former Testimonies:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fourthly, Is it not a decei|uing of the people, to say that an vnbloudie Sacrifice (such as they say the Masse is) can bee propitiatorie to obtaine remissi|on of sinnes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed, and expresly against the Word of God you haue alledged, <HI>Without shedding of bloud there is no remission:</HI> they grant themselues that in the
<PB N="177" REF="107">
Masse there is no shedding of bloud, and how then can it giue pardon or remission of sinnes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>

her Sonne Christ Iesus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good sooth these are too grosse speeches, for as you haue said, they make Christ idle in Heauen, or like a childe vnder Tuition: for my owne part I will keepe that reuerent estima|tion of the blessed <HI>Virgin,</HI> that is due to her: but will euer reserue to Christ the glorie of a Sauiour and Mediatour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it bee so, only now I will let you see that as Papistrie destroies many Articles of our Christian faith, concerning the person, and Offices of Christ: So it is a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st of Common|wealths, loosing al the bands of human fellowshippe and socie|tie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That is strange: for there are many flourishing King|domes

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember you what our Sauiour sayes in the Para|ble. So long as the strong man keepes his house all is in quiet, but when a stronger then hee comes in to bind him, there be|gins the battell: So long as Sa|than possessed the World by the darknesse of Papistrie, there was a miserable felicitie in it, and a cursed vnitie, such as was in <HI>Sodom,</HI> where young and old from the foure corners of the Citie conspired and agreed to one impietie: But now since Christ comes in by his glorious Gospell to illuminate his owne with the light thereof, that which before seemed peace in Papistrie, now appeares to bee

a fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> come from Hel seeking to deuoure all such as forsake h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r errours, and embrace the truth of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, but that is a thing wher|with they charge the Gospel, that since it was preached, ma|ny Sects and Heresies are risen vp in the world, which were not in it before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray you consider what a Polici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Sathan that is to disgrace the Gospell: how ma|nie Heresies arose in the Apo|stles dayes or soone after, that was not in the World before. Then came vp <HI>Simon Magus, Cerinthus, Ebion, Marcion, Basili|des, Menander, Valentinus, Cer|don, Marcion,</HI> and many more. Shall the Gospell be blamed for this? or rather may you not see
<PB N="191" REF="115">
it is the craft of the Deuill to dis|grace the Gospell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeede I thinke it no good reason that the Gospell should be the lesse esteemed of. There is but one truth, but ma|nifold errours; and I remember our Sauiour warning vs of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in that Parable of the Gospell; That where the good Husban|man sowes good wheat in the day, incontinent comes the E|nemie that euill one, and sowes his popple in the night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now if you apply that to our present question, the doubt is easily solued: So long as the World was blinded with idola|trie and the Masse (which in ef|fect is but a Masse of Heresies) Sathan laie quiet, hee was not troubled in his Kingdome, and
<PB N="192" REF="116">
hee raised no trouble in the World: but since the light of the Gospell discouered his darke|nesse, and that hee findes his Kingdome decaying, and him|selfe falling by the preaching of the Gospell, now he bestirres himselfe more busily, and doth what he can to disgrace this glo|rious Eva~gell by vile heresies of some that impugne it, and pro|fane liues of others who pro|fesse it. But as you see, it is no reason why the Gospell should be blamed for any of these.</P>
</SP>

<P>It is not indeed. But now you remember you beganne to discourse how Papistrie is a Pest of Common-wealthes, King|doms, dissoluing all the bands of humane fellowshippe, and societie among men.</P>

<P>They bow themselues before the Lord, to make an humble confession of their sins and supplications for mercy; which you will heare openlie read out by the publik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reader. Now when it is done what thinke you of the prayer?</P>

no thing in it, but that wherun|to eueri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> good Christian should say Amen: and it hath done me much good to see the people with humble reuerence, sighing and groning, accompanie the praier vp to God. But what goe they now to doe?</P>

<P>Euerie one is preparing (as you see) their Psalme-book, that all of them with one heart and mouth, may sing vnto the Lord. There is the Psalme which the Reader hath pro|claimed, if you please you may sing with them, or if you ca~not follow them in your heart.</P>

<P>So I will. What doth the Reader now, is he making an o|ther praier?</P>

<P>It needes not for that place, you haue brought from the Apostle, and this other from <HI>Iustin Mart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI> may let any man see the order &amp; exercise, which Christians of the church Primi|tiue obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rued in their holy as|semblies for I see no other thing among them (as you said) but publik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reading of the word in a plaine language done by the Reader till the Preacher come in, the~ publike singing of Psalms by all the people, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n preach|ing, prayer, and collection for the poore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You take it vp very well, and God be praised you see that same order among vs: And you who haue seene their seruice, &amp; dumb guise of their Masse, their

mumbling of prayers in the La|tine tongue, and the vnreuerent prophaning of the sabbath, that is among their people for la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke of discipline, may soone discerne that how soeuer they brag of an Apostolike Church, yet they haue not kept the ancient Apo|stolike order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true indeed, for if a man wil goe to a Papists church to heare Masse, he shall not dis|cerne what the Priest sayes, vn|lesse he vuderstand Latine, and I haue many times thought strange of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it falles out very well that so it should bee: The first <HI>Babel</HI> for her proud vsurpation, was punished with confusion of Languages, that when the buil|der spake the people knew not

what he craued; and iustly is the like, Yea a worse plague, in so much as it is Spirituall powred out vpon new <HI>Babel,</HI> for her in|tollerable presumption, that when their Priest speakes the people wots not what he sayes.</P>

<SP>

<P>In truth it is a great blind|nesse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so yee may say: for albeit they had no cleare Di|uine warrant in the Word, yet considering that God by an ex|traordinary decree declared his will to themselues, it is strange they should not giue place vnto it.</P>
