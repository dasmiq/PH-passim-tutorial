<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>AS this triffle of a Comedy, was only a slight piece of Scribble,
purely design'd for the Introduction of a little Musick, being
no more than a short weeks work, to serve the wants of a
thin Playhouse, and Long Vacation; under those little cir|cumstances
it needs no Apology for either the Plot or the Writing part
of it: It neither sets up for a Play, nor the Author for a Poet: Such
as it is, it has served a present Exigence, and so gain'd the Point. I
have no Appeal therefore to the Mercy either of the Auditors, or
the Reader. 'Tis true, I thrust it into the World; for 'tis the fashion
to be in Print. A Play that sees not three Days, however shall meet
with some kind Bookseller, that in spight of the Paper Tax, shall
take the naked thing into Mercy, and this hasty Brat is however a
little longer liv'd, had the Honour of keeping the Stage for five
Days Reign, and is not yet under the Fear of Abdication.</P>
<P>Yet as indifferent as I am to the merit of the Comedy (and my
Reader I suppose as indifferent) it has one Capital Argument lyes
against it; for I stand impeacht (at least the Publick Cry is loud
upon that Subject) that I have stolen a Character from a Comedy
of Mrs. P&mdash;t'<HI>s,</HI> being the Humour of <HI>Bondi</HI> the pretended blind
Man.&mdash;I would not willingly be thought so poor a Plagiary, and
am far from being guilty of this accusation. For, in the first place, I
had that hint from a Novel, and that Play of her's that has such a
Character I declare I never Read. 'Tis true, such a one she brought
into the House, and made me a Solicitor to the Company to get it
Acted, which when I had obtain'd, she very mannerly carry'd the
Play to the other House; and had I really taken the Character from
her, I had done her no more than a piece of Justice.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>

<L>TO this poor Treat, these Honour'd Guests t'i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">vite,</L>
<L>I come my own Embassador to Night,</L>
<L>To tell the truth, your Bill of Fare is small,</L>
<L>It is a little Humble Comedy, that's all:</L>
<L>For standard Sense, mine is too course Allay,</L>
<L>Alas, that Talent does not lie my way:</L>
<L>But though this Play in Wit be not so strong,</L>
<L>'Thas that will do as well, it trouls along,</L>
<L>With a whole train of Fiddles, Dance and Song.</L>
<L>And tho to other heights, my Pen can't rise,</L>

<L>Criticks, their whole Hostilities shou'd cease,</L>
<L>'Twere hard to exclude the Stage out of the Peace:</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, Spoke by Mr. Mills, ascending from under
the Stage.</HEAD>
<L>THis Scribbling Fop has given me no small trouble</L>
<L>To think how he has made the Devil a bubble,</L>
<L>To be thus Cheated is some pain, tis true,</L>
<L>But I'm afraid, to give the Devil his due,</L>
<L>He end his Devil both has cheated you.</L>
<L>Ay, That's all Hell indeed&mdash;for if you are shamm'd,</L>

<L>To this poor-Off-spring of his starvling Muse,</L>
<L>It wanted Wine and Wit, for Inspiration,</L>
<L>Being the Lean Brat of a poor long Vacation;</L>
<L>Let him, for my sake, some small Mercy find,</L>
<L>Yes, Critick's, my dear Brothers, pray be kind,</L>
<L>Strain a small point of courtesie; ay do,</L>
<L>And in my turn I'll be as kind to you,</L>
<L>You'll find the old black Gentleman so Civil</L>

<P>'Tis a hopeful Condition indeed you have brought your self to, a

I never knew you rise in a morning of late, but your Levy was more crowded

<SPEAKER>Her.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would very fain know now, what Course I wou'd not undertake, to
Live by Robbing is quite out of Fashion, for those that are worthy Money

to the Devil, I'll get something by't I'm resolv'd on't.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, before I enter into my League with you, you shall grant me
these Demands.</P>
<P>First, I will want no Wealth, but lest I shou'd be Questioned how I ga|ther
up my Riches, I will have Power to Cure the Feeble Wretches of all Dis|eases
they linger under, so by my knowledge in that wondrous Art, none will
suspect, nor envy me my Fortune; Consent to this, and I'll sign my Papers.</P>

thus far, to give immediate Health to those who are to Live.</P>

<P>Hold, Sir, let me have one word with you, I beseech you, since my
Master has pack'd up in order for the taking of a Journey to Hell, and that I as
his Faithful and Dutiful Servant must needs follow, I think it is but reasonable
we shou'd know what Company we are to keep there, and be acquainted with
their Manners and Religion, that we may avoid the Scandal of having but a
short acquaintance with the Devil.</P>

live, after the loss of Fame; there you shall see mad Lovers, Jealous Hus|bands,

<SPEAKER>Her.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I believe my Eyes, O wretched Fool, how hast thou plung|ed
thy self into perdition, this was the fatal blow my heart pre|saged,
and this the wretched end of all my Joys! O dismal Mar|riage
night! Unhappy Bridegroom! must then thy Bridal Bed be Sul|phurous
flames, and Fiends perform thy Hymencial rites? instead of
my <HI>Marcella</HI>'s soft Embraces, must I ashing Furies Clasp me in their

at a Rate so high, that the whole World weighs not a Grain of the vast

<P>Shall the bare setting of my name condemn me? how many
Wretches, in their Lust and Riots, have made a gift, seal'd firm
with Imprications? Wretches for Perjury, and foul Extoration, make
by their Crimes a Deed as strong as mine: Nay even the murderer,
whose purple stains fix to his Soul, and mark it with. Damnation,
and true Penitent Tears, 'tis Cleansed and Whiten'd for a brighter
Being.</P>

which my Father dy'd, his Confessor, Physition of his Soul come
to me, and delivered me a Paper, which I have wore ever since next
my heart: My Son, said he, take this, and when thou find'st thou art
upon the very brink of ruin, open that Paper and thou'lt find in|clos'd
that which will make thy Enemies fly from thee: now is the
