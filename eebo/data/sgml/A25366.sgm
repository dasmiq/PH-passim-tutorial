<HEAD>TO THE
Other PYROBOLISTES.</HEAD>
<P>ABout fifteen Years since I con|sidered
of a method to increase
or decrease the strength of the
Metal of Guns, which is this
that I intend to discourse of. And at the
Close of a small Treatise to hit a Mark
published in the Year 1691. I proposed
that Problem in Print; since that time
there has been more than Ordinary occasi|on
for it, by Reason of the new Casting
of the Mortar-pieces. About two Years
since I put that Problem into a method,
and made a Draught of the whole matter
to increase or decrease the strength of the
Metal of a Gun in any possible Proporti|on
assigned. But when I saw the Mortar|pieces
brought from Sea broke, it was
thought to be a good time to shew it,
<PB REF="6">
which was done, and the whole matter
discoursed of at large, but it signified
00. But now I apply that Problem to
the making of Rockets for the young
Artist, as you see in its proper place.
And it is manifest that the young Rocket-makers
of this City are very Careful and
Artificial in their Rockets of <HI>8d. 12d.</HI>
or <HI>18d.</HI> value, otherwise they may break
and so lose their Labour and Discredit
themselves. Seeing these Mathematical
Rules are so applicable to the greatest
nicety of the Rising of all sizes of
Rockets; is it not more valuable to be
applied to those Chargeable Instruments
of War, <HI>viz.</HI> Guns of all sorts, with
their Carriages, and all other their Fur|niture?</P>
<P>As to the Doctrine of shooting by the
increase and decrease of Powder, this
way of making of Rockets proves it to
be absurd; for all Rocket makers to this
time weaken the Composition of their
Rockets, as their Rockets are in great|ness,
or having greater quantities of
<PB REF="6">
Composition; and that by chance, and
without any Mathematical Demonstra|tion.</P>
<P>And also by Experience, in Table
<HI>June</HI> 1. 1691. and in the first Column
Experiment 4, against that in Column 2
you will find 4 Ounces of Powder, and
in Column 3, 3377. Again, in Co|lumn.
1, against Experiment 1 in Co|lumn
2, you find &frac12; an Ounce of Powder,
and against that in Column 3, you find
213; now because the Requisite of Pow|der
are as 8 to 1, therefore I multiply 213
by 8, and it makes 1704, much short of
3377, which indeed should have been
equal to the said 3377. that is the
Ranges upon the plain of the Horizon
are not as the Requisites of Powder which
projected those Ranges; the like may be
done in all the other Experiments. I.
have made hundreds of Experiments in
several sorts of Mortar-pieces, and am
ready to make as many more, all which
will manifestly confute the Doctrine of
shooting by the increase and decrease
<PB REF="7">
of Powder, and have often invited the
first promoter of that Doctrine to see his
Invention confuted; and I do here in|vite
all the Practitioners in that Science
of shooting by the increase and decrease of
Powder, to come and see their Doctrine
confuted. I do hear assert it is impossible
ever to bring that way of shooting to be
so exact and ready for use, in all or any
sorts of Guns, as the common or usual
way is, by keeping the Requisites of Pow|der
constant, and elevating the Piece. In
the Complicating of Rockets, whose Dia|meters
are at any great distance; we make
use of Experiments of shooting made upon
another Occasion, and those Experiments
serves sufficiently well; but if we were
to do them justly according to Art, there
should be two even Chased Guns of the
same Proportion as the Rockets are of,
that is the Diameter of the exposed Rocket
2&frac12; Inch multiplied by 6 is 15 Inches,
and those should be the Diameter and
length of one of the Guns: 4 Inches the
Diameter of the other Rocket, multiplied
by 6 is 24 Inches, which 4 Inches for
<PB REF="7">
the Diameter, and 24 Inches for the
length should be the other Gun, or any
two Guns in that Proportion. For the
Requisite of Powder take the Cube of 4,
which is 64, as also the Cube of 2&frac12;,
which is 15.625, divide the greater
Cube Number by the lesser, and the
Quotient is 4, sufficiently near; so the
Requisites of Powder of these two Pieces
are as 4 to 1, then take any reasonable
Requisite of Powder for the 4 Inch Gun,
then take the fourth part of that Re|quisite
for the Requisite of Powder for
the lesser Gun, discharge them both at
one degree of Elevation, and note their
Ranges. Their Bullets are to be of the
same Metal, and of the same likeness, and
both exactly fit. In a Mathematical
sence these Ranges should be equal;
but by Combination the greater quan|tity
of Powder aggitates more upon the
great Bullet, than the lesser Requisites
doth aggitate upon the lesser Bullet,
and that causes those differences, the like
when two quantities of Powder aggitate
upon one Bullet; it is Experience only that
<PB REF="8">
determines the matter. Although strange
things sometimes happens; yet this we
will Assert, and endeavour to maintain
that Mathematical Knowledg, join'd with
faithful Experiments, will do greater
matters than most Men commonly con|ceive.</P>

<P>MAke the Diameter of your Borer
one third of the Diameter of your

conformity to the other parts of the

exactly Taper to a point. Further, there
being an entrance made by the Needle,
it is very easie to bore the Rocket very
exactly, by holding the Rocket in the

moving the Rocket in the Left Hand,

will rise swifter than when bored, the
Composition lying looser about the Needle
than if it were bored, takes fire easier, and
this is most necessary in large Rockets,

such will hang too long time upon the
Nails before they rise. Those Rockets
whose Compositions are Composed of

<P>This will hold in Rockets of 1 Inch, 1&frac12;

must be less solidity to the hollow Cone of

that way did no better than these I now

that any one may drive and bore 3 Rockets

made of light Deal; such a Stick will do
very well, and may be counted Custom
without Demonstration. In the Winter
1695. there were two sets of Fire works,
in the first of which the Wind was North|ward,
and the Rockets in their rising
worked into the Wind. In the second the
Wind was Westward, and had the same
effect as the first; the Reason was because
the Stick was to heavy at the upper end,
and too light at the lower; and so the
Center of Gravity of the Rocket and
Stick was too near the Rocket: when in|deed
the Center of Gravity should be in
the middle, betwixt the lower end of the
Stick and upper end of the Rocket; and
to do which the bigger end of the Stick
ought to be downward; by this means a
lighter Stick would serve, and if the Wind
did drive the Rocket, the Rocket would
move less, and yet perpendicular to the

<P>IN the first Column you have the Inches
and half Inches, to 12 Inches. In the

Rockets, when six Diameters in length.
In the fourth Column you have the
Ounces of Composition to fill those
Rockets 4 Diameters. In the fifth and
sixth Columns you have the weight of
the Mallets to drive those Rockets in
Pounds and Ounces.</P>
<P>An Example in the whole, for a three
Inch Rocket. I find 3 in the first Co|lumn
under Inches and half Inches; in
the second and third Column, under
Pounds and Ounces of Rockets. I find
three Pounds and 12 Ounces the weight

32 Ounces of Composition to fill 4 Dia|meters.
In the fifth and sixth Columns
I find 20 Pounds 4 Ounces for the Mallet

<P>When Rockets are of a great weight,
the Mallet will be too heavy to manage,
therefore do thus. The Mallet of a three

6 Inch Rocket, Mr. <HI>Ayres</HI> Junior fired
them both off a hand, Mr. <HI>Dandridge,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Rodway,</HI> my self, and several other
being present: the 6 Inch Rocket had 3
Inches solid Head, that is about the double
of what it ought to have had, the Reason
of that was to hold Fire; it moved off the
Nails at about 78 <HI>deg.</HI> of Elevation, and
the Horizontal Range was just 15 Chains,
that is 330 Yards, by which we may find
the Altitude of that Parabola it moved
in, and the greatest Range, and Conse|quently
the greatest Perpendicular Alti|tude
it could have reached.</P>

<HEAD>A further use of the Tables.</HEAD>
<P>WHat is done in the 14 and 15 Pro|positions,
by taking the Cubes of
the Diameter of the Bores of the Rockets,
may be done by the Tables in 2 and 3, or
Tab 4. Thus, look in the first Column
for the Diameters of the Rockets, <HI>viz.</HI>
2&frac12; and 4, and against them, in Column
2 and 3, I find 2 Pounds and 4 Ounces,
and 9 Pounds, divide the greater Number
by the lesser, the Quotient will be 4, near
enough, so the Ratio of these two Rockets
are as 4 to 1, and this is by the weight of
the Rockets.</P>
<P>In the other Example I find 4 and 6 in
the first Column, and against them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 span">
Column 4, I find 76 and 256 Ounces of
Composition for these two Rockets; then
divide the greater by the lesser, the Quoti|ent
will be 3 and more, which is the
same thing as if you made use of the
Cubes of their Diameters; for indeed
these Tables are made by the Cubes of the
