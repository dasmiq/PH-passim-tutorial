<HEAD>TO THE REVEREND FATHERS, THE LEARNED PREACHERS AND GODLIE BRE|thren in this our English Church: I. D. and I. W. doe hartily wish the abundance of Reuelation in Iesus Christ, with an holy discerning spirit; that they may be the better inabled thereby, to discerne aright of the things that differ, and to hold fast for euer the infallible truth, for the glorie of God&punc; the Churches good, and their owne euerla|sting comfort in Iesus Christ. So be it.</HEAD>
<P>_REuerend <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.29.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 31.32.33.</NOTE> beloued and longed for in the Lord: The blessed <HI>Apostle</HI> put|ting downe some certaine <HI>pre|cepts</HI> or <HI>Canons</HI> concerning the sacred <HI>Schooles of prophesie,</HI> obser|ueth (in effect) this following order. First, hee permitteth the <HI>Prophets</HI> to speake by <HI>two or by three,</HI> appointing the o|ther <HI>Prophets</HI> to determine vprightlie of that which they speake: and then next, hee decreeth, that if any thing <HI>be reuealed to another</HI> which sitteth by, the <HI>former</HI> should be <HI>silent a time,</HI> and the other man <HI>speake,</HI> be|cause all (being thereunto called) <HI>may prophesie one by one,</HI> that all may learne, and all may haue comfort. Howbeit, least any the <HI>Prophets</HI> should happily pre|sume (vpon this his permission) to speake at their pleasure, the <HI>Apostle</HI> forthwith (for auoyding disor|dered confusion) <HI>subiecteth the spirits of the Prophets</HI> to
<PB REF="3">
which more is (if wee found them able to mannage their matters) to giue them the <HI>hand of fellowship</HI> con|cerning their <HI>doubtfull cause.</HI> Or if happily (vpon bet|ter deliberation) they yeelded the <HI>question</HI> to vs: wee protested further, to conceale their secret being, vntill some good course might forthwith be taken for in|forming authoritie as well of their present <HI>conformi|tie,</HI> as also for procuring their <HI>speedie deliuerance from the Ecclesiasticall censures,</HI> so farre foorth as possiblie might be effected.</P>
<P>Sixtly, beholding the holie <HI>Religion of Christ</HI> verie shrewdly <HI>scandalized,</HI> by reason of such falsely preten|ded <HI>miracles:</HI> we knew (in our conscience) we might <HI>doe nothing at all against the truth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.8.</NOTE> <HI>but for the truth,</HI> and therefore not possiblie conceale those <HI>truthes</HI> which the <HI>Lord</HI> hath discouered vnto vs.</P>
<P>Seuenthly, our holy established <HI>Religion</HI> being ve|rie scornefully derided with <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Atheists,</HI> as a <HI>Religion</HI> that needeth now at length to be presentlie supported by superfluous <HI>miracles:</HI> we verely perswa|ded our selues, that no good Christian heart could possiblie forbeare his best endeuour to stay their in|temperate courses.</P>
<P>Eightly, Master <HI>Darel</HI> and his fellowes very con|fidently persisting in the vnhappie support of those their newly broached <HI>opinions,</HI> hath mightily moued our hearts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iude.</HI> 22.23.</NOTE> to haue (at the least) a <HI>compassion of some, by putting a difference, and othersome again to saue with feare, by pulling them violently forth of the fire.</HI></P>
<P>Ninthly, their deceitful and coloured kind of pro|ceeding, in that they not onely pretend an <HI>holie cause,</HI> but which more is, doe varnish the same with <HI>holy pre|tences,</HI> with <HI>faire words and flattering speeches,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 16.18.</NOTE> <HI>to intangle (if possiblie they may) the very hearts of the simple:</HI> hath
<PB REF="3">
made vs the more carefully to discouer vnto all the world, what <HI>lurking poyson</HI> lieth shrowded vnder those <HI>glorious pretences.</HI></P>
<P>Lastlie, who would not both speake and write whatsoeuer they conscionablie knowe concerning these <HI>causes,</HI> if hee but respect (as in conscience hee ought) that shamefull reproch which Master <HI>Darell</HI> and his fauourits (like disordered persons) doe verie iniuriouslie impose vpon the whole land,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine pag.</HI> 88.</NOTE> vpon <HI>Magi|tracie, Ministery</HI> and people in these following words. Wee doubt not (say they) but that other <HI>nations</HI> and <HI>kingdomes</HI> about vs, will both giue credit to this <HI>matter of fact,</HI> so soone as they shall heare thereof, and see how the same hath been witnessed vpon the <HI>oathes</HI> of many: and will also receiue the <HI>Doctrine of possession and dispossession,</HI> which we so much haue gaine-saide. Blush then oh <HI>England,</HI> and be thou ashamed of this thy incredulitie, which is such as the like thereof hath not bin read nor heard of before: for others haue yet acknowledged the worke which hath been done in them, but thou hast not gone so farre, but rather de|nied the same. Loe, these (in effect) be the maine <HI>oc|casions</HI> themselues, which moued vs especially to la|bour these <HI>matters.</HI></P>
<P>Now next,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The maine ends which the au|thors propoun|ded in writing. Psal.</HI> 122.6.7.</NOTE> the <HI>principall ends</HI> which we propound to our selues in publishing our <HI>labours,</HI> are these that follow.

<P>Secondly, to make knowne to the world, our pro|uident care for the speedie preuenting of euery such future disordered courses,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit.</HI> 1.10.11.</NOTE> as happily might preiudice the whole, or any part of <HI>Gods truth,</HI> as heretofore the <HI>Brownists</HI> and <HI>Hackets</HI> haue too inconsideratlie effe|cted, by their vnruly and headie conceits.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.25.</NOTE>Fourthly, to lay open our Christian care for the timely informing of such as are contrarie <HI>minded.</HI></P>

<P>Lastly, wee haue more especially published our <HI>la|bours,</HI> to stand in steede of some prouident watch|word for <HI>yong students in Diuinitie,</HI> and newly <HI>conuer|ted Christians</HI>; that in any wise they beware how they doe either <HI>broach abroad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Ephe.</HI> 4.14. 1. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2.14. 2. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4.1.2.</NOTE> or receiue any such <HI>phanta|sticall conceits</HI> of <HI>priuate persons,</HI> as are not <HI>primarily exa|mined</HI> according to the infallible <HI>rules</HI> of the word, neither yet <HI>authentically</HI> approued by publike authori|tie.

<HEAD>TO THE CHRISTIAN AND WELL AFFECTED REA|DERS, WHO EXPECT THE COM|ming of the Lorde Iesus to their immortalitie: I.D. and I.W. doe wish the necessarie graces of the spirit, with a sauing knowledge in Iesus Christ: So be it.</HEAD>
<P>_GOod <HI>Christian Reader,</HI> when we dulie considered <HI>Maister Darel</HI> and his complices their lately dis|persed <HI>pamphlets,</HI> concerning their <HI>new-found trade of Diuillitie,</HI> as also their vndutifull manner of <HI>imprinting</HI> and <HI>publishing</HI> the same to the world: we could not but call to remembrance a most pestilent practise, which <HI>Cardi|nall Benno</HI> reporteth of <HI>Hildebrand.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Benno Cardinal. in vita Alex|andri. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> Who (hauing killed <HI>Alexander</HI> the second, for that he refused to sit at his speciall appointment in the <HI>Apostolike Sea,</HI> without the good <HI>Em|perours</HI> licence) was (by the ayde of his <HI>souldiours</HI>) forth|with enthronized into the <HI>Popedome</HI> himselfe: not ha|uing therein the consent either of <HI>Cleargie or people.</HI> The which his prowd <HI>vsurpation,</HI> when <HI>Abbas Cassi|nensis</HI> was come to redresse, <HI>Hildebrand</HI> that insolent <HI>V|surper</HI> very scornefullie sayth vnto him thus, <HI>Frater, nimium tardasti,</HI> Brother, you haue beene somewhat too slowe: to whome <HI>Cassinensis</HI> very boldly replyed saying, <HI>&amp; tu Hildebrande nimium festinasti,</HI> and thou O Hil|debrand, thou hast beene ouer-hastie by much, both in kil|ling
<PB REF="5">
thy good predecessour, &amp; in procuring the <HI>Popedome</HI> by such prowd <HI>vsurpation.</HI></P>
<P>Euen thus (surely) it falles forth with vs at this present, concerning especiallie the matters controuerted betweene our selues and those our Antagonists. For they, not only giuing the <HI>Canuisado</HI> of late to her Maiesties high <HI>Commissi|on,</HI> but hauing withall (by the venemous <HI>infection</HI> of their <HI>viperous pennes</HI>) verie vncharitablie endeuoured to wound <HI>S. H.</HI> vnto death, for that (by meanes of the sayd <HI>S. H.</HI> his dutifull <HI>discouerie</HI> of those their vndutifull dea|lings) they might not be permitted to vsurp (in our <HI>English Church</HI>) a new <HI>Apostolicall power</HI> at their pleasures, without any her Maiesties <HI>authenticall licence.</HI> Maister <HI>Darel</HI> the <HI>principall agent</HI> (partly by the inherent pride of his <HI>insolent spirit,</HI> and partly by the prowde support of many his <HI>vnder-hand fauorits</HI>) is very prowdlie <HI>enthro|nized</HI> into a new <HI>Popedome</HI> forsooth. And by priuiledge thereof he hath very peremptorily <HI>imprinted</HI> and <HI>publi|shed</HI> sundrie <HI>seditious pamphlets,</HI> hauing thereunto nei|ther <HI>warrant</HI> from <HI>God,</HI> nor <HI>dispensation</HI> from <HI>Prince,</HI> nor <HI>testimonie</HI> of sound <HI>conscience,</HI> no nor so much as the holie <HI>approbation</HI> of any good christian <HI>subiect.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this, he hath for a season (though feare and shame enforceth him now to pluck in his head) very prowdlie <HI>ietted</HI> from countrie to countrie like a pettie new <HI>Pope</HI> among his owne <HI>Cardinals</HI>; yea and that also in his <HI>pontificalities,</HI> portrayed and contriued after the <HI>new-found popelike cut.</HI> The which their <HI>vnbridled insolencie,</HI> when we indeuoured to encounter, by publishing (as we verily beleeue) the infallible <HI>truth</HI> of these intricate <HI>matters</HI> in a <HI>treatise</HI> at large, and had signified so much to themselues by <HI>word</HI> and by <HI>letters</HI> in an only desire of doing them good, they labored by <HI>letters</HI> and otherwaies to inter|cept our said enterprise a time at the least. And in the meane time (<HI>by printing and publishing</HI> the <HI>trifling toyes</HI> of
<PB REF="6">
that their new found <HI>trifling trade</HI>) they haue sought <HI>to forestall</HI> our former good purpose, and laboured to calme our carefull endeuours for doing them good. Yea, and by these their <HI>preuenting practises,</HI> they do (in effect) but disdainefullie say vnto vs, with <HI>Pope Hildebrand</HI> their prowd <HI>copartner, Deere brethren, you haue bin some|what too slow in publishing those your dialogicall Discourses concerning Spirits and Diuels.</HI> Howbeit, we (by these our <HI>subsequent labours</HI> and second <HI>encoun|ters</HI>) may with <HI>Cassinensis</HI> very conscionablie replie vpon them thus: and you, oh counterfeit <HI>Exorcistes, you haue bin ouer-hastie by much,</HI> not only in killing your good <HI>predecessour</HI> by your <HI>poysoned penne,</HI> but also in broa|ching a fond <HI>triall</HI> abroade, without any <HI>triall of truth:</HI> in designing a <HI>Doctrine,</HI> so opposite to the <HI>Doctrine of Christ:</HI> and in discouering a <HI>Detection,</HI> to <HI>detect</HI> your great follie, and shame to the world.</P>
<P>The truth of the <HI>premisses</HI> (good christian <HI>Reader</HI>) may be made more apparantlie euident, if thou wilt proui|dently examine, first, the <HI>pamphlets</HI> themselues: and then next, the <HI>spirit</HI> it selfe which may be supposed to endight the same.</P>
<P>The <HI>pamphlets</HI> themselues (notwithstanding any their outward florishing shewes) they are inwardlie faultie (we verily thinke) both in <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>manner.</HI></P>
<P>That they are ouermuch faultie in <HI>matter,</HI> is more then may be denyed, being euery of them fraught full of vnsound, and <HI>absurd positions,</HI> as shall be shewed hereafter in a short <HI>Catalogue</HI> prefixed before this <HI>booke.</HI></P>
<P>Moreouer, that they be likewise faultie in their <HI>manner or forme,</HI> may easily appeare vnto such as are not vtterlie ignorant of <HI>methode:</HI> or, do any thing know what belongs to <HI>an orderlie manner of writing.</HI></P>
<P>For first, their <HI>manner</HI> of writing, it seemes to be some|thing <HI>Schismaticall,</HI> and very shrewdlie to sauour of a <HI>Ser|pentine
<PB REF="6">
subtiltie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.</HI> Cor. <HI>11.3.4.</HI></NOTE> because (whatsoeuer their <HI>pamphlets</HI> pretend) they proceede not by a plaine course of teaching, but do rather <HI>incedere tortuos&egrave;,</HI> goe <HI>wrigginglie</HI> to worke, and walke this way and that way, like to the hunted <HI>Hare,</HI> which knoweth not whereon to resolue for a certaine.</P>
<P>Besides that, their <HI>manner</HI> of writing, it is also verie enigmaticall, obscure, and cloudie: their <HI>sentences or pe|riods</HI> they are (in effect) no better then <HI>riddles,</HI> and for the most part so vncertaine, so variable, so flitting, and so chan|ging, as none but themselues may possiblie <HI>spell, or spie forth their meaning.</HI></P>
<P>Briefely, the very <HI>frame</HI> itselfe of their whole proceeding resembleth fitlie a paire of <HI>tarriours,</HI> or <HI>tyring yrons,</HI> and serueth to no other purpose at all, but to hold men occupied all the day long about <HI>a new nothing to hang on their sleeues.</HI> Or they may well be compared to an intricate <HI>La|byrinth,</HI> or <HI>maskaring maze,</HI> from whence (when a man is once entred into them) he wots not which waies to winde himselfe forth, as may plainely appeare vnto such as careful|lie consider the same, and this in effect for the <HI>Pamphlets</HI> themselues.</P>
<P>The <HI>spirit</HI> which may be supposed <HI>to indite those pamphlets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. <HI>13.1.2.3&punc;</HI> Matth. <HI>7.15.16&punc; 1.</HI> Ioh. <HI>4.1.3.</HI></NOTE> should make wise men beware how they doe rashlie entertaine them for <HI>truths,</HI> before they haue soundly tried the same with the <HI>touchstone of truth.</HI> This sacred <HI>triall</HI> being dulie obserued herein, it may greatly be feared, that the <HI>spirit inditing those pamphlets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. <HI>3.17.</HI></NOTE> will hardly be found to sauour of that <HI>wisedome which is from aboue,</HI> which is <HI>pure, peaceable, gentle, easie to be intreated, full of mercie and good fruites, without grudging, without hypocrisie:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. <HI>3.15.</HI></NOTE> but rather to tast of that <HI>wisedome</HI> which <HI>descendeth not from aboue, but is earthlie, sen|suall, and diuellish.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> Cor. <HI>2.11.</HI></NOTE> And howsoeuer no man <HI>knoweth the secrets of man, saue only the spirit of man</HI> which is in him, and therefore may <HI>iudge nothing too rashly of

man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> Cor. <HI>4.5.</HI> Heb. <HI>4.12.13.</HI></NOTE> <HI>before the time:</HI> yet when <HI>the Lord himselfe is come, and hath lightned things which were hid in darknes, and made manifest the counsels of the hart to all mens eyes,</HI> then, I see no reason at all, but that (<HI>by the out-goings of the spirit</HI>) a man may as easily discerne the <HI>nature of the spirit it selfe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. <HI>7.16.17</HI></NOTE> as iudge <HI>of a tree by the fruites.</HI> And therefore, when we behold men caried head|long with <HI>selfe conceits,</HI> vaunting very prowdlie with the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> and saying, <HI>Quod volumus, sanctum est: quod nolumus, id iniquum &amp; iniustum.</HI> Whatso|euer <HI>we will or affect,</HI> that same is <HI>holie;</HI> whatsoeuer <HI>we nil, or affect not,</HI> that same is <HI>vniust &amp; vnholie.</HI> Briefly, when we do heare <HI>M. Darel</HI> and his vnderhand fauorits (in sundrie places of their <HI>published pamphlets</HI>) to cry out and confesse, that <HI>all the learned men in the land are of a contrarie iudgement to them,</HI> and yet notwithstan|ding, do prowdlie oppose themselues to all the learned men in the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> Cor. <HI>14.36.</HI></NOTE> as though <HI>the word of truth came out only from them, or came only vnto themselues:</HI> what should set them agog in such a glorious vaunt, but only a <HI>prowd</HI> and <HI>insolent spirit?</HI></P>

<ITEM><HI>16</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>59.</HI> he saith it is plaine, that <HI>prayer,</HI> or <HI>prayer</HI> with <HI>fasting</HI> may be an ordinarie <HI>meanes</HI> appointed of <HI>God</HI> to driue out <HI>diuels,</HI> and yet (being vsed) not prosper to that selfe same end: but page the same, he saith that if any should af|firme that <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> are not of that efficacie, to cure any Demoniake without exception, it were an impious affirmation.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>18</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>63.</HI> he saith, there is no determinati|on of <HI>miracles</HI> in the word: but pag. <HI>74.75.</HI> that it is now the sole and vndoubted badge of Antichrist to worke <HI>miracles.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>20</HI> In his doctrine, (in manie places) he saith that <HI>God</HI> hath left but one <HI>ordinarie meanes</HI> for expelling <HI>diuels,</HI> which is <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting:</HI> but pag. <HI>79.</HI> he makes two distinct <HI>meanes</HI>; the first is the supernaturall medecine of <HI>prayer</HI> alone: the se|cond he calles another of the same kind, but yet more soueraigne, namely <HI>fasting</HI> and <HI>prayer.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>21</HI> In his Doctrine, pag. <HI>11.</HI> and in his Detection, pag. <HI>100.</HI> and pag. <HI>107.</HI> he labours to proue that the parties in deed, were truely <HI>possest,</HI> and <HI>dispossest,</HI> and that vndoubtedly <HI>Satan</HI> did vex them.

<ITEM><HI>22</HI> In his Doctrine, pag. <HI>5.16.25.</HI> and <HI>29.</HI> he saith, that <HI>pos|sessions</HI> are onely to be iudged by the Scriptures, and that there|in,
<PB REF="13">
there is a direction left by the Lord, for the discerning of them. But in his Detection, pag. <HI>34.</HI> he saith that <HI>Christ</HI> did not ordaine any such meanes, for then we should haue it in the Scriptures; and such an <HI>ordinance</HI> there, I dare be hold to say we haue none.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>23</HI> In his Detection, pag. <HI>163.</HI> he saith, fier hath power to burne: but in the same pag. that fier hath no power to burne.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>24</HI> In his Doctrine pag. <HI>2.</HI> he saith, that it suteth altogether with <HI>Satans</HI> nature, to be filthy and wicked in speech: but in his Detection pag. <HI>175.</HI> he saith, that it suteth as well with his nature, to vse good and holy speeches.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>25</HI> In his Doctrine, pag. <HI>89.</HI> he saith, that the <HI>Lord</HI> (in these daies) doth send <HI>Diuels</HI> into men for these speciall endes, Name|ly, first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. <HI>16.3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</HI></NOTE> to confound <HI>Atheists:</HI> secondly to reforme some.

Yet (opposing himselfe to the word) he vseth many ydle speeches about that matter, and brabbles much for the ac|complishment of those ends thereby.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>26</HI> In his Doctrine, pag. <HI>37.</HI> he saith, the <HI>Spirits</HI> were seene and felt of the parties in some visible <HI>formes</HI> or <HI>shapes.</HI> But pag. <HI>9.9.</HI> he saith, they could not possibly be seene, or felt, being inuisible creatures: onely they were beheld in their operations and effectes.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>27</HI> In his Doctrine (in many places) he makes it a most neces|sary work which was done vpon those his pretended <HI>Demoniakes.</HI> But pag. <HI>102.</HI> he saith it was such a worke, as neither any part of truth needeth nor yet man, in regard of his weakenesse: but in the words following, he would pinne many necessary vses vpon it, name|ly, confirmation of the strong, perswasion of the weake, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>28</HI> In his Detection, pag. <HI>102.</HI> he doubts not, but <HI>Sommers</HI> may be recouered.

<ITEM><PB REF="14"><HI>31</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>47.</HI> hee saith that the <HI>Apostles</HI> faith failed not: but pag. <HI>48.</HI> hee saith their faith fayled at this time when <HI>Christ</HI> spake to them, and in this very worke.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>32</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>38.</HI> he saith that these words (<HI>going out</HI> and <HI>entring in</HI>) are neuer vsed in the spirituall sense: but (in the same place) hee saith they are often and vsuallie taken in the literall sense: howbeit in his Detection, pag. <HI>58.</HI> hee saith those words are onely but <HI>Metaphors.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>33</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>50.</HI> he saith that the <HI>Disciples</HI> could not driue forth the <HI>diuell</HI> from the child by that their <HI>miraculous faith</HI>: but pag. <HI>47.</HI> and in his Detection, pag. <HI>24.</HI> he saith they could, and that one eiected so is much more admirable, then that which is done by prayer.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>34</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>59.</HI> hee saith, that neyther the whole Church, nor any member thereof (in vsing the meanes) can haue assurance to preuaile: but (in the same page) hee saith, the assu|rance is or may be great in such a case.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>35</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>66.</HI> hee maketh fasting and prayer the onelie ordinarie meanes to cast out <HI>diuels</HI>: but (in the same page) he saith, that Satan was so cast out of <HI>Darling</HI> and the rest, as Christ himselfe did cast him out, namelie by the finger of <HI>God:</HI> which manner of working he aduiseth to distinguish from all other manner of casting out <HI>diuels,</HI> as appeareth pa. <HI>55.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>36</HI> In his detection, pag. <HI>49.</HI> he saith, that faith temporarie, and historicall, are of sufficient force to cast out <HI>diuels</HI>: but in his doctrine, pag. <HI>93.</HI> where he expresseth what he meanes by fasting, he requireth such fruits of faith to be ioyned with <HI>fasting,</HI> as can|not possiblie proceed from these his two former kinds of faith.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>37</HI> In his doctrine (euerie where) hee saith that <HI>prayer</HI> is the Churches ordinarie <HI>meanes</HI> to driue out <HI>diuels</HI>: but in his dete|ction, pag. <HI>6.</HI> he saith, to intreat <HI>Christ</HI> to cast out a <HI>diuell</HI> is <HI>mi|randum.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>38</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>45.</HI> hee saith that <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paule,</HI> they needed not to haue prayed before their working of <HI>miracles,</HI> their faith being strong: but pag. <HI>45.</HI> hee saith they did so pray, ei|ther to encrease their faith or to some other good end.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>41</HI> In his Doctrine (euery where) and in his Detection, pag. <HI>23.</HI> he saith that those are no <HI>miracles</HI> which are done by the ordi|narie <HI>meanes</HI> of <HI>fasting</HI> and <HI>prayer.</HI> But in his Detection. pag. <HI>49.</HI> he alleadgeth Math. <HI>7.22.</HI> to proue that there were others be|sides the <HI>Apostles,</HI> who cast out <HI>Diuels</HI>: which place of <HI>Mathew</HI> telleth vs expresly, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the men spoken of there, did work miracles.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>42</HI> In his <HI>1.

<ITEM><HI>45</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>44.</HI> he saith that <HI>Stapleton</HI> doth not appropriate the text in <HI>Mat. 17.21.</HI> to the <HI>Apostles</HI> of <HI>Christ:</HI> but pag. <HI>45.</HI> he saith, that <HI>Thyreus</HI> and <HI>Stapleton</HI> both doe vn|derstand that text of the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselues, who (notwithstan|ding their <HI>miraculous faith</HI>) should also haue prayed.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>47</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>49.</HI> hee distinguisheth <HI>diuels</HI> by their sundrie sorts, degrees, or orders: but pag. <HI>51.</HI> hee distinguisheth them by their only naturall qualities: as malice, crueltie, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="15"><HI>48</HI> In his doctrine, pag. <HI>59.</HI> he saith God is at libertie, and not tied to meanes: but pag. <HI>61.</HI> he tieth him fast to <HI>meanes</HI>; tel|ling vs that if <HI>God</HI> hath appointed a thing to come to passe by this or that <HI>meanes,</HI> then the <HI>meanes</HI> must be vsed, or els that thing will neuer come to passe.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>49</HI> In his doctrine pag. <HI>2.</HI> hee saith, it is absurd to affirme that the <HI>diuell</HI> (being without a man) can dispose of the whole or ante part of mans bodie: but detection, pag. <HI>110.</HI> he saith that the <HI>di|uell</HI> (in all probability) did vse <HI>Sommers</HI> his tongue; notwithstan|ding hee was essentiallie and sensiblie playing boe peepe vnder the couerled.</ITEM>

<P>If that which you say, were their <HI>meaning</HI> in deed: yet then also, euen by this their said meaning they doe flatly o|uerthrow your idle <HI>assertion,</HI> concerning the onlie bare <HI>lite|rall sense</HI> of <HI>entring in,</HI> and <HI>going out.</HI> Sith, howsoeuer they (in expounding that place) doe principallie respect the onelie true <HI>naturall sense</HI> and scope of the <HI>Scripture:</HI> yet the bare <HI>li|terall sense</HI> is vndoubtedly this: namely, <HI>a man in an vncleane spirit.</HI> The which (you see) is flat opposite to that your sup|posed <HI>essentiall inherencie</HI> of a <HI>diuell</HI> in the <HI>partie possessed:</HI> and, (by the onlie bare <HI>letter</HI> it selfe) it rather implieth the con|trarie: namelie, that the <HI>possessed</HI> himselfe, is <HI>essentially inhe|rent within the diuell.</HI> Notwithstanding all this, howsoeuer <HI>Tremellius</HI> and <HI>Beza</HI> for the former respects doe expound it thus, <HI>a man, in whom was an vncleane spirit:</HI> they vnderstand not thereby, any <HI>essentiall possession,</HI> but, onlie an <HI>effectuall o|peration of Satan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theod. litz Marc.</HI> 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> in so manie especially, as are slauishlie sub|iected vnto him. And so, Maister <HI>Beza</HI> (by a verie apt re|semblance) interprets his meaning thus. Like as saith hee, when wee see one sicke of a <HI>feuer,</HI> wee commonly say in our <HI>vulgar tongue,</HI> the man is now <HI>in a feuer,</HI> though wee meane nothing els thereby, but that he is <HI>held with a feuer,</HI> because to be <HI>in a feuer</HI> in our <HI>vulgar tongue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vt, in febre c&punc; est febre ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> sic, in spiritu esse, est spiritu teneri.</HI></NOTE> is nothing els with the <HI>Latines,</HI> but to be <HI>held with a feuer:</HI> so surelie, to be <HI>in a spirit</HI> with the <HI>Grecians,</HI> is nothing els with the <HI>Latines,</HI> but to be <HI>held of a spirit,</HI> that is, to be slauishly subiected vnto <HI>the ef|fectuall working power of a spirit.</HI> That this was the onely mea|ning of <HI>Beza,</HI> it appeareth plainely in <HI>Marke</HI>; where hee doth thus expound himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theod.

<P>The <HI>vulgar</HI> I confesse, it doth truely expresse the true <HI>sense</HI> of the place: but, obserues not the <HI>proprietie</HI> of wordes put downe in that place.

The which <HI>translation</HI> of theirs, is vndoubtedly tolerable: especiallie, if, by the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, <HI>a spirit,</HI> you vnderstand not the simple <HI>essence,</HI> but, the onely <HI>impulsion, motion,</HI> or <HI>inspiration of the spirit.</HI> Ac|cording to which <HI>sense,</HI> the word <HI>spirit</HI> is vsuallie obserued; both in the <HI>olde</HI> and <HI>new Testament.</HI> For, first in the <HI>old</HI> it is said of <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dan.</HI> 4.5.6. <HI>and</HI> 5.11.12.</NOTE> that he had <HI>the spirit of the holy Gods:</HI> that is, a <HI>diuine,</HI> and holy <HI>inspiration of God.</HI> Againe, in the <HI>new Testa|ment,</HI> the <HI>Ambassadours of Antichrist,</HI> they are said to be the <HI>spirits of diuels:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reuel.</HI> 16.24.</NOTE> that is, men of most <HI>diuelish spirits.</HI> And, e|uen so (in that place which you quote from the <HI>Euangelist Luke</HI>) where it is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 4.33.</NOTE> <HI>There was in the Synagogue, a man, ha|uing the spirit of an vncleane diuell:</HI> the meaning is, <HI>a diuelished vncleane spirit,</HI> and so, the <HI>sense</HI> of that place is currant and sound: otherwise, if by these words (<HI>the spirit of an vncleane diuell</HI>) you doe <HI>essentiallie</HI> vnderstand the very <HI>spirit</HI> it selfe, according to the onely bare purport of the <HI>letter:</HI> who seeth not then, how groslie you <HI>distinguish a spirit</HI> and <HI>a diuell</HI>; ma|king them, two <HI>distinct,</HI> or <HI>seuerall essences,</HI> the one <HI>begetting</HI> the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theod.

Howbeit, to <HI>interpret</HI> that place, both according to the true <HI>naturall sense</HI> thereof, and as neer to the very <HI>letter</HI> it selfe as may be: I would take the words of that <HI>text,</HI> to be onely but an <HI>hebraicall iterating,</HI> or <HI>doubling</HI> of <HI>one,</HI> and the selfesame <HI>matter,</HI> to make it more notoriouslie, and expreslie apparant. And this <HI>hebraisme</HI> (I assure you) is very ordinarie, and vsuall throughout the <HI>old Testament.</HI> As, first in the <HI>Psalmes,</HI> where <HI>Dauid</HI> saith

<HI>bad disposition and qualities of Saul</HI> his corrupted <HI>spirit,</HI> which being then made destitute of the <HI>graces</HI> of God, and euen vt|terlie left to it selfe: did follow the sway of it owne <HI>inclina|tion,</HI> which made him forthwith <HI>astonished, fearefull, furious,</HI> yea, vtterly <HI>disordered</HI> in his <HI>iudgement</HI> or <HI>reason.</HI> And there|fore, this <HI>affliction</HI> (you see) it must onely be vnderstoode of some <HI>mentall passions,</HI> and not of any <HI>essentiall possessions.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why man, the <HI>manner</HI> of this his deliuerance, it doth <HI>ar|gue</HI> the contrarie of that which you say. For tell me I pray you, hath the sound of an <HI>harpe</HI> any force at all to expell a <HI>diuell essentiallie inherent in any mans bodie?</HI> This we hold for a certaine, that no <HI>created meanes</HI> may effectiuely extend it selfe to the powerfull effecting of any such <HI>supernaturall acti|ons,</HI> as doe any way concerne the <HI>essentiall dispossessing of spi|rits,</HI> and <HI>diuels,</HI> the which point (in our eight <HI>Dialogue</HI>) is
<PB N="29" REF="30">
handled at large. And therefore the melodious <HI>sound</HI> of <HI>Da|uids harpe,</HI> it might onelie <HI>asswage</HI> (for the present) those <HI>me|lancholike passions</HI> which mightily swaied in <HI>Saul</HI> his <HI>minde:</HI> but it could not possiblie haue <HI>cured</HI> the <HI>essentiall possession of spirits or diuels,</HI> if any such, had bin extant in <HI>Saul.</HI> Other|wise, it would <HI>consequentlie</HI> follow, that men might <HI>fiddle</HI> forth <HI>spirits</HI> and <HI>diuels</HI> from <HI>parties possessed,</HI> and so there should be a necessarie vse of <HI>pipers</HI> and <HI>fidlers</HI> for the timelie <HI>dispossessing</HI> of these your pretended <HI>Demoniakes.</HI> As for <HI>Saul</HI> (howsoeuer his bad humour was <HI>eased</HI> a time) it is verie ap|parant hee was neuer perfectly cured thereof to the day of his death: and therefore not <HI>essentiallie possessed.</HI> Thus then, you may see it apparantly euident, both by the <HI>proprietie</HI> of the <HI>originall</HI> word: by the plaine <HI>opposition</HI> of <HI>spirits</HI> put downe in the <HI>text:</HI> by the <HI>effects</HI> themselues which followed of <HI>Sauls astonishment:</HI> and by the <HI>manner</HI> of <HI>curing</HI> that selfe|same maladie, that <HI>Saul</HI> was neuer <HI>essentiallie possest</HI> with ei|ther <HI>spirit</HI> or <HI>diuell,</HI> and so consequentlie, that (till a little be|fore the comming of Christ) there were no <HI>possessions</HI> at all in <HI>Israell.</HI> Yea, and thus much also, that generall <HI>admiration</HI> of all the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 9.33. <HI>Mark.</HI> 1.27. <HI>and</HI> 2.13. <HI>Luke</HI> 4.36.</NOTE> which concerned especiallie those selfe same <HI>primarie dispossessions</HI> performed by Christ, may seeme to im|port; saying thus: <HI>the like was neuer seene in Israell.</HI></P>

<P>Be it so as you say.

But be it supposed you neuer saw him be|fore, and then tell vs how you dare so confidently conclude from those his supposed actions, an <HI>essentiall possession</HI> of some <HI>spirit</HI> or <HI>diuell:</HI> sith <HI>diuels</HI> (you know) are such spirituall and inuisible substances, as may not possiblie be discerned by a|ny <HI>corporall sense.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why sir? his <HI>supernaturall actions</HI> do plainely demonstrate the same to all the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rehearse some few of those his supposed supernaturall <HI>actions</HI> I pray you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will. First he continuallie <HI>waggeth his head</HI> without anie intermission at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>So doth the <HI>palsie sicke patient,</HI> as we may see by daylie ex|perience: and (which more is) whereas the palsie-sicke hath no intermission at all: that your pretended <HI>Demoniake,</HI> hee onelie waggeth the head in the day time and when people are present, howbeit in the night time he sleepes very qui|etlie as his owne mother reporteth. And therefore if an on|ly bare <HI>wagging of the head</HI> doth necessarilie argue an <HI>essen|tiall
<PB N="72" REF="52">
possession:</HI> then euery <HI>palsie sicke patient</HI> that waggeth the head, hee also is essentiallie possessed of <HI>Satan.</HI> Howbeit sir? we also our selues haue seene this your supposed <HI>Demoniake</HI> as well as your selfe: but could not perceiue in him any such supernaturall actions or <HI>passions,</HI> as you boldlie report vpon your bare credit.</P>
<P>Besides that, if the onlie bare <HI>wagging of the head</HI> must ne|cessarilie conclude a supernaturall action: then euery little childe that playeth wag-wanton, it also effecteth some su|pernaturall action. Moreouer this one and the rest of those your pretended <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> they were and are commonlie ouertaken with those their supposed <HI>supernaturall fits,</HI> when they are layd on their <HI>bedde,</HI> and closelie vnder a <HI>couerlid:</HI> by which meanes they may the more easilie wagge their heads, or worke any their pretended actions, and so likewise the sooner deceiue the sillie beholders. Who being wholie ta|ken vp before with a deepe impression of some supposed es|sentiall <HI>possession:</HI> were thereby so fearefullie forestalled in iudgement, as they could not prouidently behold nor adui|sedlie consider the manner of the <HI>Demoniakes</HI> working. And therefore this <HI>wagging of the head,</HI> it is no such supernaturall <HI>action,</HI> as may vndoubtedlie conclude an <HI>essentiall possession.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>But sir? besides this extraordinary wagging of the head, he is also of a <HI>supernaturall strength.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No such <HI>supernaturall strength</HI> was apparant to vs, being present with him (I assure you) in the very extremitie, or middest of those his pretended <HI>fits.</HI> For the one of vs did ea|sily hold his head, his shoulders, and all the other parts of his bodie from mouing at all, yea, and this also euen in de|spight of the <HI>boy</HI> himselfe, or of any supposed <HI>Diuell</HI> inherent within him: and therefore this <HI>supernaturall strength,</HI> is ra|ther supposed and suggested by your selfe and your fauou|rites, then any waies soundly prooued, or but probablie de|monstrated to vs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides all this, hee was vndoubtedly of a <HI>supernaturall knowledge:</HI> for if two or three had suddenly come into the parlour where he lay, with <HI>seuerall bookes</HI> of sundrie matters
<PB N="73" REF="52">
hid close in their <HI>hats:</HI> hee could tell which of them had the holie <HI>Bible</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in his <HI>hat,</HI> and at him he would catch and snatch, letting all the <HI>prophane bookes</HI> passe quietly by him without any such stirre at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>So could <HI>Bankes his blacke horse</HI> very sensiblie demon|strate what money some had in his purse, with sundrie other <HI>trickes</HI> more admirable then this by much: and yet not possessed at all with a <HI>Diuell.</HI></P>
<P>So a <HI>blind man</HI> (but casting his <HI>staffe</HI> at all aduenture) may happely at some time to kill a <HI>Crow:</HI> and yet neither indued with <HI>supernaturall knowledge,</HI> nor possest with a <HI>Diuell</HI> in the doing thereof.</P>
<P>So likewise, a <HI>blindfolded lubber</HI> playing at <HI>blindman buzz,</HI> may happely (by skuffling vp and downe in the house) to light vpon one and the selfe same person for two or three times together: and yet not assisted therein at all with any <HI>supernaturall knowledge,</HI> or led thereunto by any the extraor|dinarie directions of either <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Diuell.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly, so likewise a little <HI>yong child</HI> playing at <HI>handie dan|die,</HI> may happely (for three or foure times together) to make choise of that <HI>hand</HI> wherein the <HI>pin</HI> or the <HI>point</HI> is placed: and all this (I hope) without any <HI>supernaturall knowledge</HI> at all. And therefore it is very absurd that your selfe (from any such <HI>action</HI> as stands only vpon <HI>hap and hap hazard</HI>) should so confidently conclude a <HI>supernaturall knowledge,</HI> and so (by consequence) an essentiall <HI>possession</HI> of either <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Diuell.</HI></P>
<P>Besides that, how confidently soeuer you report this point of chusing the <HI>Bible</HI> before any other <HI>booke</HI> else: there bee some of good credit, and such also as fauour your cause (so farre forth especially as they perceiue not as yet the contra|rie truth) who doe confidently report that in deede and in truth, this your supposed <HI>Demoniake</HI> did so much as you say for once or twice: but that at some other times againe hee had failed grosly therein: and therefore this <HI>tricke</HI> of <HI>hap-hazard,</HI> is no such certaine <HI>signe,</HI> as may vndoubtedly con|clude an essentiall <HI>possession,</HI> in that your pretended poore <HI>patient.</HI></P>
<P>I told you a little before (if you haue not forgotten) that (whensoeuer you hapned afresh vpon some other such <HI>new-found
<PB N="74" REF="53">
Demoniake</HI>) we then should haue some other <HI>new signes</HI> of this your supposed essentiall <HI>possession</HI> to make your <HI>game hit:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Supra, in pag.</HI> 44.45.</NOTE> and now I perceiue it is growing very fast towards such a pretended <HI>period.</HI> For behold, wee haue here now (in this your newly pretended <HI>Demoniake</HI>) two other <HI>essentiall signes</HI> forsooth of an essentiall <HI>possession:</HI> namely, the <HI>wagging of the head:</HI> and the <HI>playing at handie dandie.</HI> Alas <HI>Exorcistes,</HI> though your <HI>conscience</HI> trembleth not, yet me thinkes your very <HI>face</HI> should blush for shame, in reporting these <HI>trifling toyes</HI> for true and <HI>infallible tokens</HI> of an essentiall <HI>possession</HI> of some one <HI>Diuell</HI> or other, inherently couching within the very bodie of this your <HI>new-found Demoniake.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>But sir, besides all this the <HI>boy</HI> (I assure you) he is (for the whole time of his fearefull <HI>fits</HI>) so <HI>senselesse</HI> in euery part, as he neither <HI>seeth,</HI> nor <HI>heareth,</HI> nor <HI>speaketh,</HI> nor <HI>feeleth:</HI> and therefore essentially <HI>possest</HI> with a <HI>Diuell.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>How know you for certaine, that hee is (in deede and in truth) so <HI>senselesse,</HI> as you beare vs in hand? You are able (I confesse) to know when your <HI>selfe</HI> neither <HI>seeth,</HI> nor <HI>heareth,</HI> nor <HI>speaketh,</HI> nor <HI>feeleth:</HI> but that you should (in like man|ner) discerne as soundly of any such <HI>defect of sense</HI> in ano|ther, it is much more (I beleeue) than you are able to de|monstrate truely vnto vs. For be it supposed, that (for the whole time of those his pretended <HI>fits</HI>) there is in him no <HI>vse of his senses</HI> in any outward appearance to men: doth it follow necessarilie, that therefore there is within him also no true <HI>habite of sense</HI> at all? that is more (I beleeue) then you may truly auouch. Sith a man in a <HI>traunce</HI> may seeme (in all outward appearance) as though he were vtterly <HI>depriued of sense:</HI> when yet still he retaineth soundly <HI>an habite of sense,</HI> though (for a season) he wanteth the <HI>vse</HI> and practise thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the very <HI>instance</HI> you giue, doth cleerely illustrate the infallible truth of that which I tell you. For euen as a man in a <HI>trance</HI> may seeme (in all outward appearance) as if he were <HI>sensles:</HI> so doth this poore boy (I assure you) in euery of those his fearefull <HI>fits:</HI> and therefore he is essentially <HI>possest</HI> with a <HI>Diuell.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="75" REF="53">
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>That followeth fayre and farre off: yea and (by as good reason) you may likewise very boldlie conclude, that the man in a <HI>traunce is also possest</HI> with a <HI>spirit</HI> or <HI>Diuell</HI>: because (in all outward appearance) he seemeth no <HI>lesse sensles</HI> then this your pretended <HI>Demoniake.</HI> But (by the way) be it here graunted freely vnto you, that an vndoubted <HI>true sense|lesnesse</HI> doth argue (in deed) an <HI>essentiall possession:</HI> yet are you not able to demonstrate truely vnto vs, that the <HI>boy</HI> at <HI>Northwich,</HI> is (in those his pretended <HI>fittes</HI>) vndoubted|lie and truly <HI>so senslesse</HI> as you beare vs in hand, but that (howsoeuer it seemed in outward appearance) he both <HI>sawe</HI> and <HI>heard,</HI> and <HI>spake,</HI> and <HI>felt,</HI> as may very probablie be ga|thered thus.</P>
<P>First, that he <HI>sensiblie heard</HI> it is very apparant, in as much as my selfe but wishing (in his presence) a sight of his <HI>vrine,</HI> and being told by his <HI>parents,</HI> that the <HI>vrine</HI> which he first made in the morning was newly cast forth, but yet (said they) if you stay any time, you may happilie haue some from him afresh before it bee long: within a while after, such meanes was made by the <HI>boy</HI> (notwithstanding he was then in the <HI>extremitie of his fit</HI>) as I had forthwith his <HI>vrine</HI> (for|sooth) in no lesse orderly a manner, then if he had been in his perfect estate, which argueth plainely, that either his <HI>mother</HI> she had an extraordinarie <HI>reuelation</HI> concerning the fit time for affoording his <HI>vrine</HI> vnto her: or that the <HI>boy</HI> himselfe (hauing heard before my <HI>motion</HI> concerning that matter) did make such meanes as (notwithstanding that his said <HI>fit</HI>) his <HI>mother</HI> very orderly receiued his <HI>vrine</HI> without any spil|ling at all in the <HI>bed,</HI> and therefore this concludeth no <HI>sense|lesse condition,</HI> but rather the contrarie.</P>
<P>Againe, that he <HI>sensiblie sawe</HI> at that present, we proue it thus: because (besides the often casting of his <HI>eyes</HI> vpon vs at sundrie times) when his sister also came to his <HI>bed</HI> side in a foule or <HI>sluttish coate,</HI> and was therefore rebuked sharpelie of her <HI>mother:</HI> the <HI>boy</HI> (both seeing his <HI>sisters sluttishnes,</HI> and hearing his <HI>mothers rebukes</HI>) hee <HI>laughed</HI> heartilie thereat. And thereupon, the <HI>mother</HI> being tolde by the one of vs there, that the <HI>boy</HI> (it should seeme) he was not so <HI>sensllesse</HI> as they would beare vs in hand, her answer was this: name|ly,
<PB N="76" REF="54">
that the <HI>shrewd boy,</HI> he would oftentimes laugh in his <HI>fittes</HI> at many such <HI>knaueries:</HI> which argueth in him no such <HI>sensles condition</HI> as your selfe would pretend.</P>
<P>Againe, the <HI>Boy</HI> being kept (for tenne dayes together) in the <HI>Lord Bishop of Chester his pallace,</HI> and secretlie watched by some of his <HI>seruants,</HI> to spie forth his counterfeit carriage if any such were: he told his mother so much when hee was returned home (as she confesseth her selfe) and how the Bi|shops men stood <HI>peeping</HI> at him through the <HI>chinkes</HI> of the <HI>dore</HI> to spie forth his <HI>practises.</HI> But <HI>mother</HI> (saith he) I <HI>saw</HI> them full well, and was also as <HI>craftie</HI> as they: which argueth no <HI>sensles condition</HI> at all.</P>
<P>Againe, that he also (at that present) very <HI>sensiblie felt,</HI> may thus be prooued. Namely, for that the one of vs holding him fast perforce (as we told you before) he not onlie endeuou|red to preuent our sayd purpose, but when hee perceiued himselfe to be conquered in despite of his teeth, he forthwith <HI>roared</HI> and <HI>cryed out:</HI> which argueth plainely that he <HI>sensiblie heard,</HI> and <HI>saw</HI> and <HI>felt</HI>; yea, and that he might also be made to speake (as appeares by his <HI>crying</HI>) if he were well <HI>coniured</HI> a while with a <HI>three corded whippe.</HI> And therefore for any thing hitherto heard, this your <HI>new-found Demoniake,</HI> hee was not so sensles, as your selfe would <HI>senselesly</HI> beare vs in hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>But sir, hee spake many <HI>wonderfull things</HI> in euery of his traunces, yea such and so straunge (I assure you) as could not possiblie be vttered forth by one of his yeares, without some supernaturall direction of eyther <HI>spirit</HI> or <HI>diuell</HI> at the least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>We heard not any such speeches at all at our being there with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true as you say. Howbeit at sundrie other times hee vttered many: al which were penned downe from his mouth by sundrie <HI>persons,</HI> and some of them also verie graue and godlie <HI>Preachers,</HI> as may plainely be seene in many <HI>sheetes of paper,</HI> wherein they are all very carefullie recorded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Might not those graue and godly <HI>Preachers</HI> haue beene
<PB N="75" REF="54">
better imployed in some more profitable studie for the glorie of <HI>God,</HI> and the good of his <HI>Church:</HI> but that they must bee wholie taken vp many <HI>houres</HI> and <HI>dayes</HI> together about such <HI>trifling toyes,</HI> and become forsooth the <HI>publike notaries</HI> to a <HI>paltrie boy,</HI> or rather (if you please) to some sup|posed <HI>diuell</HI> inherently and <HI>essentiallie</HI> in him? Wee knowe not what account they themselues should possiblie make of so fruitlesse a course: howbeit, wee thinke (for our owne parts) that they might haue beene better imployed by much.</P>

<P>_THis pleasant fresh ayre (I assure you) hath well re|freshed our feeble <HI>spirits:</HI> and therefore, that we protract no further time, doe tell vs directly <HI>Ex|orcistes</HI>&punc; what you say now to your falslie pretended <HI>Dispos|session</HI> of <HI>Diuels</HI> by <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Fasting?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, hauing sufficiently proued, that the eight <HI>persons</HI> we speake of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine, pag.</HI> 34.</NOTE> were euery of them <HI>essentiallie possest</HI> by the <HI>Diuell,</HI> yea, and this also, with such vnanswerable and inuincible <HI>arguments,</HI> as may fully perswade an indifferent <HI>Reader,</HI> there needes no further labour herein. Nnotwithstanding, be|cause that which makes for the proofe of their <HI>Dispossession</HI> tendeth directlie to the further confirmation of that their said <HI>essentiall possession,</HI> I am therefore readie with the like inuincible <HI>reasons</HI> to deale in that poynt if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>It pleaseth vs passing well: and the sounder you deale, the better we like it, and the sooner we shall make an ende. As for your sufficient prouing of that which you falslie pre|tend: let the indifferent <HI>Reader</HI> determine. In the meane time, because you brag beyond measure of your vnanswe|rable,
<PB N="82" REF="57">
and inuincible <HI>arguments</HI> to mannage your <HI>matters</HI> withall; we will therefore the more exactly examine them seuerally, to make present <HI>triall</HI> of that their pretended <HI>force.</HI> And whereas you seeke to shelter all those your falslie pre|tended <HI>Patients,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine, pag.</HI> 34.35.36.</NOTE> vnder an holie couerture of the parties <HI>dis|possessed</HI> in <HI>Scripture,</HI> and by such a deuice would seeme to soare aloft in the <HI>clowdes,</HI> before you be <HI>feathered fleg,</HI> to flie at so loftie a <HI>pitch:</HI> this therefore wee must tell you, or euer we enter the <HI>combat,</HI> that the holie <HI>Scriptures</HI> themselues wil not yeeld their holie protection, to so paltrie a cause. And therefore that which we haue hitherto spoken against your falslie pretended <HI>essentiall possessions,</HI> may fullie suffice to an|swere the whole, because where there was <HI>no true possession,</HI> there can be <HI>no dispossession</HI> in truth: yet, because the finall o|uerthrow of these your pretended <HI>dispossessions,</HI> doth more fully destroy your falslie supposed <HI>essentiall possessions,</HI> we are also here readie to encounter your vttermost force. Preter|mitting therefore all those your falslie pretended <HI>signes</HI> of <HI>dispossession</HI> from sacred <HI>Scripture,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine, pag.</HI> 34.35.36.</NOTE> as also your intolerable <HI>prophanation</HI> thereof by your fond <HI>applications:</HI> doe presentlie proceede in propounding vnto vs your <HI>arguments.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine, pag.</HI> 37.</NOTE>I will. First, there were in euery of our <HI>Demoniakes</HI> those selfesame <HI>signes</HI> or <HI>notes of dispossession, precedent</HI> and <HI>subse|quent,</HI> which wee reade of in the <HI>Scripture Demoniakes:</HI> and therefore there was in euery of them the selfesame <HI>disposses|sion</HI> no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If there were no doubt in the matter at al: it were vndoub|tedly a meere madnes for any to impugne the same. How|beit, thus we answer your <HI>argument.</HI> There were not in those your pretended <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> the selfesame <HI>signes</HI> or <HI>notes pre|cedent and subsequent:</HI> therefore not the selfesame vndoubted <HI>dispossessions.</HI> That there were not the selfesame <HI>signes or notes,</HI> I proue it thus. First, those <HI>signes or notes</HI> in the <HI>Scripture Demo|niakes,</HI> they were vndoubted <HI>effects</HI> of their <HI>dispossessions:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. Discouerie, pag.</HI> 177. <HI>and cap.</HI> 5. <HI>pag.</HI> 294. <HI>and pag.</HI> 297. <HI>Doctrine, pag.</HI> 37.</NOTE> the <HI>signes</HI> or <HI>notes</HI> in those your pretended <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> they were in truth but counterfeit <HI>cousonages,</HI> as themselues haue freely confessed vpon their <HI>oathes.</HI> Furthermore, those <HI>signes</HI> or <HI>ef|fects</HI> which wee finde in the <HI>Scripture Demoniakes,</HI> they were
<PB N="83" REF="57">
sensibly performed to the view of the <HI>beholders eye:</HI> the other in those your pretended <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> they were not so by your owne confession. Againe, howsoeuer those <HI>signes or notes</HI> in <HI>Scripture Demoniakes,</HI> were the vndoubted <HI>effects of dispossessions</HI> then, and so to be taken, because they are recor|ded for such by the blessed <HI>Euangelist,</HI> who could not erre in so recording the same: those your falsely pretended <HI>signes,</HI> they are but the vnruly reports of your <HI>lying pen,</HI> directed therein by a <HI>deceitfull heart:</HI> yea, they bee such <HI>signes</HI> (Master <HI>Darell</HI> affirmeth) <HI>as men may be deeply deceiued in discerning thereof.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine. pag.</HI> 18. <HI>Detection, pag.</HI> 54.</NOTE> Besides that, those selfesame <HI>effects</HI> in the <HI>Scripture Demoniakes</HI> then, they cannot so concludently proue <HI>dispos|sessions</HI> now: because the like <HI>effects</HI> doe eftsoones also arise from meere <HI>naturall causes, and corporall diseases,</HI> as our sea|uenth <HI>Dialogue</HI> declareth at large. And therefore if those selfesame <HI>effects then,</HI> must necessarily bee made the vndoub|ted true <HI>signes</HI> of <HI>dispossessions now:</HI> then, wheresoeuer is the like <HI>rending</HI> and <HI>tearing, crying aloude,</HI> and <HI>leauing for dead,</HI> there is also the like <HI>essential dispossession of Diuels,</HI> which were to too absurd to imagine.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Detection, pag.</HI> 54.</NOTE> Briefly, your good friend Master <HI>Darell,</HI> he doth confidently conclude a <HI>dispossession of Diuels,</HI> where no such <HI>signes</HI> are apparant: and therefore those your pretended <HI>signes precedent and subsequent,</HI> they doe not ne|cessarily conclude an <HI>essentiall dispossession of Diuels.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes sir,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine, pag.</HI> 36.37.</NOTE> for besides those <HI>Scripture signes,</HI> I haue (in my proper <HI>experience</HI>) eftsoones obserued in the <HI>dispossession</HI> of some certaine <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> a very <HI>sensible seeing,</HI> or <HI>feeling</HI> of some thing <HI>going out of their bodies</HI> like to a <HI>Mouse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Narration, pag.</HI> 13.</NOTE> an <HI>Vrchin,</HI> a <HI>Toade,</HI> a <HI>Bull,</HI> a <HI>foule blacke man,</HI> a <HI>Dog,</HI> and such like: and therefore there is vndoubtedly an <HI>essentiall dispossession of Di|uels.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What man? are you wearie alreadie of those your <HI>Cano|nicall notes of dispossessions,</HI> that you are fled so soone to those your owne experimented <HI>apocryphall signes or effects?</HI> Surely it should seeme your <HI>force</HI> is but weake. Notwithstanding, howsoeuer you say you haue eftsoones obserued such things in your <HI>owne experience:</HI> very certaine it is, that not your owne selfe, but those your counterfeite <HI>Patients</HI> rather (if
<PB N="84" REF="58">
any at all) they alone experimented some such supposed <HI>sensible seeings,</HI> and <HI>feelings</HI> of some thing <HI>going out of their bo|dies:</HI> and therefore it is very vntrue to say that you your owne selfe obserued the same in your <HI>proper experience.</HI> Be|sides that,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine, pag.</HI> 36.37.</NOTE> Master <HI>Darell</HI> (your good friend) doth flatlie af|firme, that the <HI>Spirits</HI> themselues, <HI>they neither were, nor conti|nued with those his pretended Demoniakes, in any such sensible bodies,</HI> as you say here you haue eftsoones obserued in sun|drie of them: and therefore impossible there should be any such <HI>sensible seeing</HI> or <HI>feeling of substances</HI> proceeding foorth from them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine, pag.</HI> 37.</NOTE> as you beare vs in hand. For howsoeuer you seeme to qualifie your former speech from <HI>the Spirit his sup|posed operation in the present procuring of some such sensible mat|ters in shew, at the very instant of their seuerall dispossessions:</HI> that is ouer childish a conceit, to perswade any reasonable man, hauing especially <HI>his eyes in his head.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccles.</HI> 2.14.</NOTE> For the <HI>Spirits,</HI> they could not by any their supposed <HI>operations</HI> whatsoeuer, pro|cure such <HI>sensible things,</HI> as might be <HI>sensiblie seene,</HI> or <HI>palpablie felt</HI> of any whosoeuer: as in our second, third, fourth, and fift <HI>Dialogues</HI> is shewed at large.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine, pag.</HI> 37.</NOTE>Yea, but besides all this, I haue (by my proper <HI>experience</HI>) obserued eftsoones in sundrie <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> a <HI>vomiting</HI> imme|diatly before the <HI>egresse</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> prognosticating plain|lie vnto vs, his imminent <HI>essentiall dispossession:</HI> and therefore there is vndoubtedly an <HI>essentiall dispossession of Diuels.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this your new-coyned <HI>Prognostication,</HI> had (indeede) been <HI>printed with priuiledge,</HI> wee might (by the warrant thereof) not onely bee perswaded of the very trueth of that which you prate: but withall, we might (by vertue thereof) very boldly auouch, that euery <HI>Gormandizing belli-god,</HI> and surfetting <HI>Swil-boule</HI> (so oft as they happen to spue) are <HI>es|sentially dispossest,</HI> of one <HI>Diuell</HI> at the least. Yea, and so much more likely than the other you speake of, by how much those your pretended <HI>Demoniakes spitting vp but a little quan|tity of choler or phlegme</HI> (as your selfe do report) and that also with very great labour:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.</HI> 2. <HI>Narration, pag.</HI> 13.</NOTE> these drunken <HI>Epicures,</HI> they doe spue forth the <HI>Spirits</HI> by whole <HI>pottles</HI> at once, and that with a trice. Besides that, if <HI>vomiting</HI> (forsooth) be an vndoubted
<PB N="85" REF="58">
<HI>true signe</HI> of <HI>essentiall dispossessions:</HI> it is very probable that men may mightily further the <HI>essential dispossessing of diuels,</HI> by pro|curing the <HI>possessed</HI> to <HI>vomite</HI> forthwith. Brieflie the <HI>scriptures,</HI> they make no mention at all of these your <HI>apocryphall signes</HI> of <HI>essentiall dispossessions:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine. pag</HI> 37.</NOTE> and therefore they are no certaine signes of any such matter, but must (saith good M. <HI>Darel</HI>) be regarded of all men accordingly.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Darell&punc; in the report of Tho|mas Darling, pag.</HI> 153. <HI>S.

<P>Why sir,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doctrine. pag.</HI> 37.</NOTE> we vsed <HI>prayer and fasting</HI> in such <HI>proper termes,</HI> and to such <HI>speciall end,</HI> I meane to their <HI>essentiall dispossessions,</HI> and the same was forthwith effectuall; for the <HI>Lord,</HI> he vn|doubtedly heard vs, and wee saw the very worke it selfe ac|complished according to our owne desires: therefore there is now, vndoubtedly an <HI>essentiall dispossession of diuels.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you so stricktly tyed your selfe to some set and <HI>appoin|ted termes</HI> for such purpose as you pretend, it seemes then (by the purporte of your speech) that you rather <HI>coniured the diuell from those your Demoniakes,</HI> then entreated the <HI>Lord</HI> to cast them out: and then how can you from thence so con|fidently conclude that your <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> was effectu|allie heard of the <HI>Lord?</HI> For this <HI>question</HI> may iustlie arise from your speech: Namely, whether the powerfull efficacie of those your <HI>charming tearmes,</HI> had simplie and onelie their relation to <HI>God alone:</HI> or to <HI>God and the diuell together?</HI> If sim|plie, and onlie to God alone, then you doe therein directlie affirme, that <HI>God</HI> respected rather the <HI>forme,</HI> then the <HI>faith</HI>; rather the <HI>termes</HI> then the <HI>truth of your prayer.</HI> And therein withall, you doe implicatiuely put downe the principall cause why the rest of the <HI>Preachers</HI> (notwithstanding their often attempts by <HI>feruent prayer</HI>) could not possiblie expell <HI>William Sommer</HI> his combersome <HI>diuell</HI> as well as your selfe: namely for that they wanted euerie of them, those <HI>terrible
<PB N="86" REF="59">
termes</HI> which would haue striken it dead.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Narration pag.</HI> 1. <HI>D. Apologie, in pag.</HI> 31.32.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this crosseth Master <HI>Darel</HI> very shrewdlie ouer <HI>the thumbes,</HI> who telleth vs plainely that the <HI>dispossession of Satan</HI> is so or|dinarie and so easie a matter, as it may <HI>be effected of any, how simplie soeuer:</HI> whereas that which your selfe here reporteth, implieth a quite contrarie tale, and concludes it impossible for any to accomplish the worke, but such as are first made throughlie acquainted with the <HI>proper tearmes</HI> of that <HI>trade.</HI> Againe, if the powerfull efficacie of those your <HI>charming tearmes</HI> had their relation to <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>diuell together:</HI> then how dare you so confidently auouch, that those your sayd <HI>prayers</HI> (vttered forth in such set and appointed <HI>termes</HI>) were heard of <HI>God:</HI> sith (it may be) the <HI>diuell</HI> himselfe (being feare|fullie frighted with those <HI>terrible tearmes</HI>) was voluntarilie fledde beyond the <HI>vtmost borders of Egypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tob.</HI> 8.3.</NOTE> or euer the <HI>Lord once</HI> opened his mouth concerning such his present depar|ture from those your pretended <HI>Demoniakes.</HI> Besides all this, those your <HI>charming termes,</HI> they are (it should seeme) of a wonderfull working power: in that not onelie they are able (by your owne saying) to driue out the most <HI>combersome di|uell</HI> with a trice: but (which more is) to accomplish (in all likelihood) an vndoubted <HI>regeneration</HI> euen in the <HI>Demoni|akes</HI> themselues,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine, pag.</HI> 37.</NOTE> as a man may collect by your speech. For <HI>you desired</HI> (you say) <HI>that the diuell might so be driuen forth from euery of them, as their bodies might forthwith become temples of the holy Ghost to dwel in: and euen at the very instant you saw the worke visiblie accomplished, according to your owne desires.</HI> This being so as you say, no wonder at all, though the <HI>Inhabitants of Nottingham</HI> were so desirous to entertain your <HI>person</HI> and <HI>preaching:</HI> the very <HI>termes</HI> of your <HI>prayers</HI> being so effectuall as you beare vs in hand. But tell vs (I beseech you) from what special grounds you are so certainely assured, that the <HI>meanes</HI> which you vsed in those your supposed <HI>dispossessions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine, pag.</HI> 59. <HI>Darrels Apolog. pag.</HI> 32. <HI>Dar. Doctrine, pag.</HI> 18.</NOTE> were so <HI>effectuall then:</HI> sith M. <HI>Darel</HI> himselfe doth flatlie affirme, that <HI>both prayer alone, or prayer and fasting together: they are not alwaies effectuall to that selfesame worke.</HI> Yea, and (which more is) how could your selfe be so certaine thereof, seeing <HI>Satan</HI> (as you say) is so cunning, <HI>that he can cause many things to be in appearance which are not so indeed &amp; in truth: &amp; can also pretend a departure, when as yet he lieth secretly lurking within
<PB N="87" REF="59">
the Demoniakes bodies?</HI> Brieflie, how are you sure the worke it selfe was forthwith effected in such sort as you say, I meane,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine. pag.</HI> 37.</NOTE> that <HI>you visiblie saw the diuell driuen forth of those your Demoniakes, &amp; their bodies effectuallie made temples (at the ve|ry instant) for the holy Ghost to dwell in:</HI> sith as well the <HI>essentiall dispossession of diuels,</HI> as also that admirable worke of <HI>regene|ration,</HI> are eyther of them <HI>spirituall matters,</HI> and may not pos|siblie be discerned with <HI>corporall sense?</HI> And therefore we see not how the worke was forthwith accomplished according <HI>to your owne desires:</HI> vnles happilie <HI>your owne desires</HI> (being then onely to haue the beholders deluded) came so to passe, as you sawe (therein) your hearts desire in such sort effected. This <HI>reason</HI> therefore (howsoeuer it may serue in some sort to discouer your <HI>dissimulation</HI>) it concludes no <HI>essentiell dis|possession of Diuels.</HI></P>

them rather according to the predeterminate purpose of your <HI>proper desires,</HI> as wee told you before.

And so by <HI>consequence,</HI> these their dis|sembling reports concerning <HI>Satan his earnest desire of repos|session:</HI> they are none other then the bare reports of a <HI>lying diuell,</HI> or <HI>senselesse Demoniake</HI> at least, and no better to be esteemed of vs, then meerely <HI>phantasticall and senselesse re|ports.</HI> Besides all this, those your pretended <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> they reported no more concerning these admirable matters, then either that alone which they were taught before to prattle like <HI>parrats,</HI> or then that which they (being grossely deluded by the <HI>diuell</HI> him selfe, or <HI>his diuellish dissembling ympes</HI>) did verely imagine to be vndoubtedly euen so as they supposed the same: and therefore they onely reported the <HI>idle imagi|nation</HI> of their own <HI>idle braine.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.

admitte <HI>the case</HI> to be thus; The <HI>Queenes Maiestie</HI> (next and immediatly vnder <HI>God</HI>) doth gouerne this kingdome by her <HI>absolute authoritie.</HI> This <HI>absolute authoritie,</HI> she hath <HI>(in part)</HI> dispensed to some certaine <HI>persons,</HI> subordinate vnder her, for the orderly <HI>execution of iustice and mercie</HI> among the rest of her <HI>subiectes:</HI> ratifying, and approuing what|soeuer those <HI>persons</HI> shall correspondently conclude ac|cording to the <HI>tenour of her Maiesties pleasure,</HI> expres|sed at large in her <HI>Lawes.</HI> Yea, and approouing the same to be as <HI>authenticall,</HI> as if she (by her <HI>absolute authoritie</HI>) had effected the same in her owne proper person. And (which more is) vpon the primarie establishment of her said <HI>absolute authoritie,</HI> she appointeth (as a <HI>temporarie of|ficer</HI>) the <HI>L.

<P>Nay, <HI>loose</HI> for a shilling: as will plainely appeare by the triall thereof.

<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they did more then they needed to haue done, and yet sinned not at al in doing the same: it seemes by your speech that the <HI>Apostles prayer,</HI> it was then some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <HI>super|errogation</HI> at least; and so, therein not onely they iumped iustly with our <HI>Papists</HI> now, whom we generally condemne for such an insolent and proud conceite, but (which more is) they dealt directly therein, against the holy <HI>institution</HI> of their master <HI>Christ.</HI> Who wils them else where, that <HI>(when they haue done whatsoeuer they were able) they should notwith|standing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 17.10.</NOTE> <HI>acknowledge themselues but vnprofitable seruants:</HI> and so (by consequence) if (in <HI>praying</HI> as before) the <HI>Disciples</HI> did more then they needed to haue done; then surely (how|soeuer the pride of mans <HI>nature</HI> might superarrogate some thing vnto it selfe) it appeareth by <HI>Christs</HI> mouth, that they were but <HI>arrogant sinners,</HI> if that which your selfe doth auouch, be counted for currant.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine, pag.</HI> 48.</NOTE> If that <HI>Scripture</HI> hath speciall relation to the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselues, as you seeme to auouch: then surely, (howsoeuer they had faild in their enterprise) they might notwithstanding haue made this one defence, or excuse for themselues: namely, that they had no spare time for those <HI>speciall exercises,</HI> since they first saw the <HI>childe.</HI> The which so fit a <HI>defence</HI> or excuse, they would neuer haue omitted: be|ing especially so sharply reproued of their master before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>That <HI>Scripture,</HI> it may not be <HI>appropriated to the Apostles</HI> (you say) for many <HI>respects:</HI> making their pretended <HI>excuse</HI> (from a supposed want of time, in the timely dispatch of those speciall <HI>exercises</HI>) the principall <HI>respect</HI> thereof. Surely, a worthy <HI>respect</HI>; and the same very respectiuely put downe no doubt, for many <HI>respects.</HI></P>
<P>For, First you were throughly acquainted (it seemes) with all the <HI>spare time</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> then had at that present.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is very likely you knew how <HI>much of that time</HI> they must necessarily haue bestowed to the full: in the effec|tuall discharge of that duetie.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="75">Thirdly, you were also very certaine no doubt, that if they but wanted <HI>one minute</HI> of that your appointed time: then surely (how succinctly, or how feruently soeuer they should put vp their <HI>prayers to God</HI>) their labours therein had been vtterly lost.</P>
<P>Lastly, you were made priuie (it seemes) to the <HI>Apostles purpose</HI> then, in <HI>not praying at all:</HI> who, perceiuing some want of time for the timely performance of those speciall <HI>exerci|ses,</HI> would not therefore vndertake them at all, for losing their labors, but tooke (as it seemes) their said want of time for a <HI>backesette,</HI> or a profered aduantage in their pro|per defence, if haplie they should faile (as they did) in the powerfull <HI>dispatch of that enterprise.</HI></P>
<P>Now surely, the <HI>Disciples of Christ</HI> are highly beholding vnto you for this their proper <HI>defence</HI>; whereof they them|selues (it should seeme) were vtterly ignorant. Howbeit, had the <HI>Disciples</HI> dreamed in deed of such a sillie defence: yet surely, that dreaming defence, it had beene directly a|gainst the whole course of the <HI>historie,</HI> as may very plainely appeare by the seuerall <HI>circumstances</HI> concerning the same.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 17.1.</NOTE>For, first the possessed <HI>childe</HI> was presented vnto them, at the very selfe same time their master <HI>Christ</HI> was gone vp to the <HI>mount:</HI> being in the <HI>mount,</HI> he was forthwith <HI>transfigured,</HI> in the presence of <HI>Peter, Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verse</HI> 2.</NOTE>In the time of his <HI>transfiguration:</HI> he talked a time with <HI>Moses, and Elijah.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verse</HI> 6.</NOTE>After his <HI>transfiguration,</HI> he comforted the three <HI>Disciples:</HI> who were greatly amazed at that which they saw and heard.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verse</HI> 7.</NOTE>Hauing comforted and reuiued their troubled <HI>Spirites:</HI> he wils them very carefully to conceale the <HI>vision</HI> it selfe, till after his death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verse</HI> 9.</NOTE>After this <HI>speciall charge,</HI> he reformed their error concer|ning <HI>Elijah</HI> his comming.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verse</HI> 11.</NOTE>These things thus dispatched in order: he forthwith de|scended from out of the <HI>mount.</HI> Being so descended, he saw the people thronged together:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mark.</HI> 9.14. <HI>Verse</HI> 16. <HI>Verse</HI> 17. <HI>Verse</HI> 18.</NOTE> and the <HI>Pharisees</HI> very hotly disputing with his other <HI>Disciples,</HI> about their not <HI>dispossessing</HI> of the <HI>child</HI> as it seemes.</P>
<P>These <HI>circumstances</HI> duely considered, it is apparantly euident, that the <HI>Disciples</HI> they had time enough to haue
<PB N="121" REF="75">
<HI>prayed:</HI> and therefore, that your imagined <HI>want of time,</HI> it could be no colourable excuse, to colour their carelesse negligence in awakening their <HI>faith</HI> by feruent <HI>praier to God.</HI> Moreouer, in saying the <HI>Apostles</HI> would neuer haue omit|ted that profered <HI>excuse,</HI> from the want of time to those <HI>spi|rituall exercises:</HI> therein you derogate much from the <HI>Disci|ples</HI> their conscionable dealings in such sacred matters. For, what other thing else doth your speech import, but that ei|ther there was in the <HI>Disciples</HI> themselues, such absolute per|fection of <HI>foreseeing knowledge,</HI> as they neither would, nor possiblie could haue ouerseene, or pretermitted whatsoeuer might make for their proper defence: or that the <HI>Disciples</HI> at least (if especially they had been men of your <HI>humour</HI> and quicke <HI>conceite</HI>) they would (vpon euery occasion) haue beene forward enough, in making their present <HI>apologies,</HI> how preposterous, absurd, or vnsound soeuer.</P>
<P>Brieflie, howsoeuer you dreame, that the <HI>Disciples</HI> would haue made their <HI>excuse</HI> from that your imagined want of time to such <HI>spirituall exercises:</HI> it seemeth rather (their con|science being fully conuinced before, from the due conside|ration of the precedent <HI>circumstances</HI> concerning the suffi|ciencie of time for such businesse) that they (in all good con|science) did plead themselues guiltie of carelesse negligence, in not vsing the <HI>meanes</HI> of feruent <HI>prayer</HI> for the timely stir|ring vp of their <HI>faith.</HI> And therefore, they (by their purpo|sed silence) doe secretly consent to <HI>Christs reprehension,</HI> as a <HI>reprehension</HI> very iustly imposed vpon them for their former negligence: so farre off are they from falsely <HI>excusing</HI> them|selues, by any falsely pretended <HI>want of time.</HI> By all the <HI>pre|misses</HI> then, it is very apparant, that this your first <HI>reason</HI> hin|dreth nothing at all; but that the former speech of our Sa|uiour <HI>Christ</HI> may peculiarly, and onely be appropriated vn|to the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselues.</P>

<P>Brieflie, whereas your selfe (by vrging so stricktly the <HI>Leui|ticall fasts</HI>) would haue the <HI>Disciples</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> euen necessari|lie taken vp with those exercises of <HI>fasting</HI> and <HI>prayer</HI> for a <HI>whole day together:</HI> your old friend M. <HI>Darel,</HI> it seemes he af|foords them more fauour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.

Our answere is, that you do ouerproudly or peruersely controll the <HI>wisedome of Christ:</HI> and it may please you to consider withall, that the time be|tweene <HI>Christ</HI> his <HI>transfiguration</HI> and <HI>Pentecost,</HI> was not so short, as you haplie (by your inconsiderate accompt of bare <HI>fortie dayes</HI>) would beare vs in hand: for, if you runne ouer your reckonings afresh, you shall finde the <HI>interim,</HI> I meane the distance betweene them, to be full <HI>tenne weekes</HI> at the least.

<P>Not so sir: the proofe (I assure you) is pregnant enough, if we but marke what we read in the <HI>scriptures</HI> concerning this point.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 6.2. <HI>Psal.</HI> 80.1. <HI>Ezech.</HI> 10.1. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.16. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.21. <HI>and</HI> 6.12. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Col.</HI> 3.10. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6 12. 1. <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.16. <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.31. <HI>Dionysius, in caelest&punc; hierarch. cap.</HI> 2. <HI>pag.</HI> 7.8.</NOTE> For therein is mention made of <HI>Seraphims, Cheru|bims, Thrones, Dominations, Vertues, Powers, Principalities, Archangels and Angels:</HI> all which (you may see) are <HI>di|stinct</HI> or <HI>seuerall names.</HI> But those <HI>nine seuerall names</HI> are gi|uen vnto <HI>Angels</HI> in regard of their <HI>nine seuerall orders in hea|uen:</HI> therefore there are also <HI>nine seueral orders of diuels in hell.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Dionysius</HI> in deed, from those <HI>nine seuerall names,</HI> doth conclude (as you say) nine <HI>seuerall orders of angels:</HI> yea, and (which more is) hee doth afterwards verie quaintlie <HI>distin|guish</HI> those nine seuerall orders into a threefold ternarie of Angels, as may plainely appeare in his <HI>booke,</HI> if any were so surprised with palpable follie, as he could be brought to be|leeue the same.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.

<P>You demaunde what <HI>impietie, absurditie,</HI> or <HI>daunger</HI> doe follow your said <HI>exposition:</HI> I am content to giue you some inckling thereof.</P>
<P>First, it is <HI>impietie</HI> to auouch any thing for <HI>truth,</HI> which is not a <HI>truth:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 1.18.</NOTE> or to father a lie vpon <HI>Christ,</HI> and so <HI>to hold the truth in vnrighteousnes.</HI> It is <HI>impietie</HI> to put vpon the pure <HI>Spouse of Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.10.</NOTE> the besmearing <HI>brand</HI> of that <HI>antichristian strumpet</HI>; to whome alone is <HI>giuen power to worke lying signes and wonders in all deceiueablenesse of vnrighteousnesse:</HI> and so make her (saith M. <HI>Darel</HI>) to boast or bragge that she hath in <HI>her eare the marke of a Rogue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.

Beza, in</HI> 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.5. <HI>Moses Pella|cher. in Matth.</HI> 17.21.</NOTE> It is <HI>impietie</HI> to draw <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> from their peculiar and proper appointed ends, namely, from being but <HI>proppes</HI> and <HI>helpes</HI> for the onlie support of our <HI>feeble faith in the promises of God:</HI> and to make them the only <HI>sole meanes</HI> for the powerfull expelling of <HI>diuels</HI> without any <HI>faith</HI> at al. Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine, pag.</HI> 106.</NOTE> and euen such a <HI>meanes</HI> forsooth, as may (saith M. <HI>Da|rel</HI>) enable a <HI>reprobate</HI> to effect such a worke.

<P>Now next for <HI>absurdities.</HI> It is to too <HI>absurde</HI> to auouch that <HI>fasting</HI> is more effectuall and more powerfull for the expelling of <HI>spirits</HI> and <HI>diuels</HI>; then is <HI>prayer</HI> it selfe.

<P>Now next shall be handled succinctlie the <HI>daungers</HI> also thereof: which are both manie, and those also most mightie. For first it cannot but be fearefullie dangerous, that the <HI>Church</HI> should be brought to imbrace for <HI>infallible truth</HI>; that which cannot possiblie be proued a <HI>truth.</HI> Againe, it is vndoubtedly dangerous for the <HI>Church,</HI> by this <HI>meanes</HI> to consort her selfe with her <HI>enimy,</HI> especially in such grosse and erronious <HI>opinions.</HI> To practise <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting,</HI> as a perpe|tual <HI>ordinance</HI> establisht by <HI>Christ</HI> for the powerful expelling of <HI>diuels:</HI> hauing no one warrant in the word for the same. To be made carelesse of the true <HI>spirituall armour</HI> against <HI>Sa|tan</HI> in deed: by buzzing secretlie into her eares, that which is not her <HI>armour</HI> appointed by <HI>God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ephes.</HI> 6.12.</NOTE> Loe, these are some of those palpable <HI>impieties, absurdities,</HI> and <HI>dangers</HI> which must necessarilie succeed your said <HI>exposition:</HI> and yet you are not ashamed to enquire what <HI>impieties, absurdities,</HI> or <HI>daungers</HI> may possiblie follow thereof.</P>

<P>Very true. Howbeit, by <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> those selfesame <HI>meanes were sanctified,</HI> for the powerfull effecting of those speciall workes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then their <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> were not the <HI>meanes</HI> it <HI>selfe</HI> which effected those <HI>works:</HI> but onely a <HI>spirituall exercise, to sanctifie the meanes themselues</HI> which were to effect the same. And so by consequence, <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting,</HI> they are not the <HI>sole meanes</HI> that driues foorth a <HI>diuell:</HI> but they are rather a spirituall exercise, to <HI>sanctifie</HI> and <HI>strengthen the meanes</HI> in deed that must doe it, namely the <HI>miraculous faith.</HI> Which said <HI>faith</HI> being then ouer sluggish and weake in the <HI>Apo|stles</HI> themselues: should necessarily haue been stirred vp, and supported thereby.</P>
<P>So then those words of <HI>Christ,</HI> they implie no <HI>established ordinance</HI> for the perpetuall expelling of <HI>diuels:</HI> but doe on|ly import a <HI>speciall meanes</HI> for the timely confirmation of the <HI>Apostles faith.</HI> And therefore, this which you hitherto speake will neuer endure the hammering, for that which you purpose.</P>

<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You flee (I perceiue) from one starting hole to another, as a man almost spent, or in much feare at the least of being ferretted forth. For here now (as before in <HI>possessions</HI>) you are driuen to
<PB N="164" REF="97">
your <HI>popish distinction of written and vnwritten ordinances.</HI> And thus (by laboring very egerly to shunne the <HI>sands of suspition</HI> concerning a supposed confederacie with <HI>Sommers</HI> his couso|ning courses) you run your selfe desperatly vpon the dangerous <HI>rocks of discredit,</HI> co~cerning your iumping with <HI>Papists</HI> in their <HI>popish</HI> opinions. For, (by this your <HI>blind distinction</HI> of <HI>ordinan|ces vnwritten and written</HI>) you do very plainely demonstrate your selfe to be a <HI>chicken of father Bellarmines hatching,</HI> who (elsewhere no lesse fondly then your selfe here very foolishly) distinguisheth the <HI>word of God,</HI> into <HI>verbum scriptum</HI> and <HI>ver|bum non scriptum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bellarm. de scriptu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> into the <HI>word written</HI> &amp; the <HI>word vnwritten.</HI> By which your cunning sleights of <HI>legerdemaine,</HI> you do very cunningly endeuour to foist in (vnderhand) whatsoeuer grosse fooleries or fond conceits your owne priuate phantasies shall fondly affect. And therefore it shall not be greatly amisse, if you ioyntly together receiue your answeres, first, from the <HI>written word</HI> it selfe, and then next from your holie <HI>fathers decrees,</HI> vn|der whose <HI>trayterous ensigne</HI> you ioyntly skirmish in this so spe|ciall a combate.</P>
<P>First therefore (from the <HI>written word it selfe</HI>) we will finally squash your fond <HI>distinction</HI> thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 8.20.</NOTE> If the <HI>Prophet Isaiah</HI> redu|ceth the aduersaries of truth whatsoeuer <HI>to the lawe and the te|stimonie,</HI> telling them farther, that <HI>if they speake not according to this word, it is because there is in them no sacred truth:</HI> then surely, <HI>father Bellarmine</HI> and your selfe (labouring thus lewdlie to foyst in such your <HI>vnwritten fooleries,</HI> as are not according to <HI>the law and the testimonie</HI> reuealed at large in the <HI>written word</HI>) you do plainely declare, that you are now necessarily driuen to these indirect dealings, because there is in you no <HI>truth</HI> at all.</P>
<P>Againe, if <HI>Christ</HI> commaundeth his aduersaries <HI>to search the scriptures,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.39. <HI>Act.</HI> 17.11.</NOTE> because in them they thinke to haue eternall life, tel|ling them withall, that <HI>they are those which testifie truly of him:</HI> then no doubt, he doth purposely restraine them all from en|quiring after any <HI>vnwritten verities,</HI> because such do neither testifie of him, nor may possiblie affoord any sound euidence at all to eternall life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15.16.17.</NOTE>Againe, if the holie <HI>scriptures</HI> (the <HI>word written</HI> I meane) are (of themselues) sufficiently able not only to make men wise to saluation, but (which more is) were purposely giuen of God, as the only profitable directions and rules for teaching, impro|uing,
<PB N="165" REF="97">
correcting and instructing in righteousnes, to make the man of God very absolute to euery good worke. If the <HI>written word</HI> I say, be fully sufficient to worke these effects; then surely those your supposed <HI>vnwritten ordinances</HI> are meerely superflu|ous.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.

But both these effects (sayth the <HI>blessed Apostle</HI>) are sufficiently attayned vnto by the <HI>written word:</HI> and therefore that <HI>vnwritten word</HI> which <HI>father Bellarmine</HI> and you so fondly dreame after, is meerely superfluous, and doth no|thing else (in effect) but defile the flesh, and deceiue your owne soules.</P>
<P>Now next we will likewise lay open your dottages concer|ning this your supposed <HI>vnwritten word,</HI> from your holie <HI>father</HI> his <HI>authenticall Canons</HI> thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Decret. p.</HI> 1. <HI>distinct.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 9.</NOTE> <HI>Si solus Christus audiendus est, non debemus attendere quid aliquis ante nos faciendum putauerit: sed quid (qui ante omnes est) Christus prior fecerit.</HI> That is: If <HI>Christ</HI> only be to be heard, we are not to respect what any one else hath or shall thinke meete to be done; but what <HI>Christ</HI> (who was before all) hath first done himselfe. Now then, if <HI>Christ a|lone</HI> must be heard, whose voyce is onely knowen in the <HI>scrip|tures,</HI> I meane in the <HI>written word:</HI> then surely your <HI>vnwritten word,</HI> and whatsoeuer <HI>ordinance</HI> else is not apparantly extant in <HI>scripture,</HI> nor may (by necessary consequence) be soundly col|lected from thence, the same is meerely superfluous. So then, this your <HI>exorbitant distinction</HI> of <HI>written</HI> and <HI>vnwritten ordi|nances,</HI> it may not possiblie be made to support the importable burden of that your supposed <HI>established ordinance of prayer and fasting,</HI> for the perpetuall expelling of <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Diuels:</HI> but it falles flat (you see) to the ground.</P>
<P>Besides that we haue euer denyed, and your selfe shall ne|uer be able to proue, that <HI>sole prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> is either a <HI>writ|ten,</HI> or <HI>vnwritten ordinance,</HI> forthe powerfull expelling of <HI>Spi|rits</HI> and <HI>Diuels.</HI> And (which more is) this your owne <HI>argument of comparison,</HI> it cutteth asunder the very throate of this your phantasticall opinion, as may plainely appeare by conferring each part of your <HI>comparison</HI> more fully together.</P>
<P>For, seeing you insist so much vpon <HI>naturall infirmities,</HI> and (by proportion thereof) would proue vnto vs the <HI>supernatu|rall
<PB N="166" REF="98">
possession</HI> of <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Diuels:</HI> this you know (in experi|ence) that euery <HI>naturall cure</HI> is either <HI>ordinarie</HI> or <HI>extraordi|narie.</HI> An <HI>ordinarie cure</HI> is that which in an <HI>ordinarie course,</HI> and by <HI>ordinarie meanes</HI> procureth an <HI>ordinarie effect in the partie diseased.</HI> Now in an <HI>ordinarie cure</HI> there must necessarily con|curre these following matters.</P>
<P>Namely, first, <HI>an ordinarie naturall medicine</HI> to effect the in|tended <HI>cure:</HI> as for example, <HI>eie-bright</HI> to cleere the dimnes of sight.</P>
<P>Secondly, a <HI>secret operation of nature</HI> must necessarily con|curre with the <HI>medicine</HI> it selfe, to make it naturallie forcible for effecting the <HI>cure:</HI> otherwayes the <HI>medicine</HI> it selfe is vtterly vn|fruitfull.</P>
<P>Thirdly, there must be a <HI>ministeriall hand</HI> for the orderlie <HI>ap|prehending,</HI> and <HI>applying of that the aforesaid medicine.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, there is also required in the <HI>Phisition</HI> himselfe the <HI>theorie,</HI> or knowledge of <HI>natures operation,</HI> to direct him aright in that selfesame busines.</P>
<P>Fiftly, there must be also an <HI>ordinarie meanes</HI> to imprint such a <HI>theorie,</HI> or knowledge in the <HI>Phisitions brest.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>the habite of this theorie</HI> or skill is that only, which imboldeneth and warranteth the <HI>Phisition</HI> himselfe in such an <HI>orderly practise.</HI></P>
<P>Thus then you see that the <HI>Phisition</HI> his only <HI>knowledge</HI> con|cerning the secret <HI>operation of nature,</HI> is that which imboldneth and guideth the hand it selfe, in an orderlie apprehending and applying of that selfesame <HI>medicine</HI> to such an effected <HI>cure.</HI> And the <HI>cure</HI> in such sort effected, it is without doubt an <HI>ordi|narie cure,</HI> as hauing all things <HI>ordinarily</HI> concurring together in an <HI>ordinarie course of nature.</HI> Howbeit, if the <HI>Phisition</HI> should effect the said <HI>cure</HI> by <HI>sole prayer and fasting alone,</HI> without any such <HI>naturall medicine,</HI> or by a quite <HI>contrary meanes:</HI> namely, if he (together with <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI>) should worke the sayd <HI>cure</HI> by the only applying of a <HI>plaister of clay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ioh.</HI> 9.6.</NOTE> which naturallie hath in it selfe no <HI>naturall disposition</HI> at all for the orderlie ef|fecting of any such worke, and wherein <HI>nature</HI> her selfe neither hath, nor naturally can haue any such <HI>secret operation</HI> at all: then surely the <HI>cure</HI> it selfe (in such sort effected) it is vndoubtedlie <HI>supernaturall, extraordinarie, and meerely miraculous.</HI> By the premisses then you may plainely perceiue, what things (in a
<PB N="167" REF="98">
<HI>naturall disease</HI>) must necessarily concurre, for the timely effec|ting of the <HI>ordinarie cure</HI> thereof: and therefore do tell me plainely, whether you make the <HI>possession of Diuels a disease</HI> or not?</P>

<P>Now next for the <HI>vsage of meates and drinkes,</HI> they (in like manner) are euermore effectuall either to <HI>nourish,</HI> or to <HI>annoy</HI> the <HI>bodies of men</HI> at the least: which are the <HI>two certaine ends,</HI> whereunto they are certainly appointed of <HI>God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psalm.</HI> 105.40. <HI>and</HI> 107.9. 1&punc; <HI>King.</HI> 19.8. <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.30.31. <HI>and</HI> 105.16. <HI>and</HI> 106.16.</NOTE> For as men at sometimes doe feed very <HI>moderatly,</HI> and are much <HI>refreshed thereby,</HI> because the <HI>Lord</HI> so appointed the same: so surely at sometimes againe, euen when they are <HI>eating,</HI> and <HI>while the meate is still in their mouthes, the wrath of God falleth very fear|fully vpon them.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, for <HI>plowing and sowing,</HI> very certaine it is the same shall euermore effectually prosper, in procuring <HI>abundance</HI> or <HI>barrennes</HI> vpon the ground at the least: which are the <HI>two certaine ends</HI> whereunto they are certainly appointed of <HI>God.</HI> For howsoeuer we may (by the secret <HI>operation of God</HI>) beholde in <HI>Isaack his tillage the blessing of abundance:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 26.12. <HI>Psal.</HI> 107.34.</NOTE> yet sometimes againe, <HI>the Lord maketh the fruitfullest land to be|come very barren, because of the wickednesse of such as dwell therein.</HI></P>
<P>Thus then you may plainly perceiue, that both <HI>preaching,</HI> and <HI>feeding,</HI> and <HI>plowing</HI> they are neuer in vaine, but doe <HI>ef|fectually worke</HI> to that <HI>certaine end,</HI> whereto they are certain|lie

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>The reason is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine. pag.</HI> 59.</NOTE> because the <HI>Lord</HI> is euer at libertie, and not tyed to any one <HI>meanes</HI> at all, he may blesse or keepe backe (if hee please) the blessing which himselfe hath appointed: and then the <HI>meanes</HI> or <HI>second cause</HI> it selfe will neuer pre|uaile.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is vntrue. For if the <HI>Lord</HI> hath appointed <HI>the meanes it selfe to a certaine end,</HI> he is not then at libertie, but hath ne|cessarily <HI>bound himselfe to that selfesame meanes,</HI> so farre forth especially, as concernes that <HI>certaine end</HI> whereunto he hath certainly appointed the same: yea, and he must also (in equi|tie) euen make the said <HI>meanes</HI> to be very effectuall. So as if at any time the <HI>meanes</HI> it selfe be vtterly <HI>ineffectuall,</HI> we may certainly conclude, that the <HI>Lord</HI> had not certainly appoin|ted the same to that <HI>certaine end.</HI></P>
<P>The which point Master <HI>Darell</HI> perceiued full well,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine. pag.</HI> 61.</NOTE> as ap|peares by his speech, saying thus: When the <HI>Lord</HI> appoints a thing to come to passe by such or such <HI>meanes,</HI> the same <HI>meanes</HI> must be vsed: otherwaies that thing shall neuer be. So then, if <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> be (as you say) an ordinarie <HI>meanes</HI> very certainly and purposely appointed of <HI>God</HI> for the powerfull expelling of <HI>Diuels,</HI> the said <HI>meanes</HI> (being vsed accordingly) must needes bee effectuall from time to time: and (being so made effectuall) the worke it selfe is vndoub|tedly <HI>miraculous.</HI></P>

<P>Nay sir,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine, pag</HI> 59.</NOTE> you are greatly deceiued.

<P>Very true as you say, the <HI>entreating word it selfe</HI> is no <HI>mi|racle.</HI> Howbeit, the <HI>question</HI> is, whether that worke so <HI>extra|ordinarily</HI> effected by <HI>Christ</HI> his absolute <HI>authority,</HI> at the on|ly <HI>entreatie</HI> of some one or a few, be not in very deede a <HI>mi|raculous worke?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not I assure you, and that also for these following reasons: first, because there is <HI>no assurance</HI> to preuaile in this case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your <HI>assurance</HI> is as certaine to trust vnto, as the holding of a <HI>wet Eele by the taile:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine, pag.</HI> 59.</NOTE> yea, and Master <HI>Darell</HI> himselfe doth flatly affirme, that this reason of yours is a very ab|surd and <HI>an impious reason.</HI> Besides that, in saying there is no <HI>assurance</HI> to preuaile in this case; you doe therein directlie conclude, that the same is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>ordinance</HI> established by <HI>Christ.</HI> Because euery of his <HI>ordinances</HI> (how weake or how waue|ring soeuer they seeme in the eyes of the world) they are <HI>sure and certaine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine, pag.</HI> 25.</NOTE> according to his <HI>absolute decree</HI> and most cer|taine appointment.</P>
<P>Besides this, in saying that (albeit <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> bee vsed accordingly) we haue yet <HI>no assurance</HI> at all to preuaile in this case, you doe nothing therein but giue good Master <HI>Darell</HI> the lie;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine, pag.</HI> 26.</NOTE> who telleth vs plainlie, that howsoeuer the <HI>Lord</HI> hath appointed vs to <HI>fast</HI> and <HI>pray</HI> when we are in any other affliction of <HI>bodie</HI> or <HI>minde,</HI> neither shall our said la|bour be vndertaken in vaine: yet hath he no where so <HI>cer|tainly promised,</HI> that our said <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> shall so <HI>effe|ctually prosper</HI> to the deliuering of vs from such an affliction, as in this very case of <HI>possession</HI> he hath promised in <HI>particular</HI> and by <HI>speciall words,</HI> saying thus: <HI>This kinde goeth not foorth but by prayer and fasting.</HI> Therein secretly promising, that <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> being vsed accordingly, the euill <HI>Spirits</HI> they doe, and shall goe forth.</P>
<P>Moreouer, if you haue no <HI>assurance</HI> at al to preuaile in this case, why did you then so presumptuously vndertake to <HI>pray for a spirituall blessing</HI> vpon those your <HI>Demoniakes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Doctrine, pag.</HI> 26.</NOTE> namely, that their <HI>bodies</HI> might forthwith be made <HI>temples for the ho|lie Ghost to dwell in:</HI> sith all <HI>spirituall graces</HI> whatsoeuer, must
<PB N="175" REF="102">
euermore be prayed for earnestly, and with an vndoubted assurance? Yea, and how could you euen now so confident|ly auouch, that the worke it selfe was vndoubtedly effected before your <HI>eyes,</HI> sith the effects themselues are not possiblie comprehended by <HI>corporall sense,</HI> and there is no <HI>assurance</HI> (you say) to preuaile in this <HI>case.</HI></P>
<P>Brieflie, if there be no assurance at all to preuaile in this case, then those your former directions or <HI>rules</HI> (concerning especiallie an <HI>experimentall prayer</HI> for three or foure howers together, and that your <HI>effectuall addition of fasting,</HI> with your warranted assurance of preuailing against any <HI>Diuell</HI> how headstrong soeuer) they are (for ought I perceiue) but vncerteine directions: yea, and then also you haue therein procured your yoong <HI>practitioners</HI> else where, very groslie to <HI>prophane</HI> the holy exercise of <HI>prayer and fasting,</HI> by their taking of the same (for some three or foure seuerall times) in vaine, about the <HI>dispossessing</HI> of your newly pretended <HI>De|moniak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> they hauing (as your selfe here affirme) no assurance at all to preuaile in that case. And therefore (for any thing I see) their onely refuge is this, to say (in excuse of that their said <HI>enterprise</HI>) <HI>aliquando fallit regula:</HI> or to make (for their proper defence) that selfesame answere, which the Schole|men doe make for their Master thus. <HI>Hic non tenet Magister,</HI> here our Master hath missed the Cushion.</P>
<P>By all the premisses then you may plainly perceiue, that (notwithstanding the supposed force of this your first rea|son) the worke it selfe (being truly effected in such sort as you say) it was vndoubtedly a miraculous worke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the worke was in deed a <HI>miraculous worke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dar. Doctrine. pag.</HI> 59.60.</NOTE> then surely <HI>Tertullian, Cyprian, Chrysostome</HI> and others, so oft as they ex|pelled the <HI>Diuels</HI> by <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting,</HI> they also wrought <HI>miracles.</HI> But either that is vtterly false: or, you doe other|waies conclude, that the <HI>working of miracles</HI> was also in vse at those times, a thing directly opposite to the iudgement of all men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Tertullian, Cyprian, Chrysostome</HI> and others, so oft as they expelled <HI>Diuels</HI> by <HI>sole prayer and fasting alone:</HI> so oft no doubt, they effected <HI>true miracles.</HI> Howbeit, no such power|full
<PB N="176" REF="103">
expelling of <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Diuels</HI> hath been hitherto pro|ued in any one of them all: and therefore (notwithstanding any thing you prate to the contrary) the <HI>working of miracles</HI> might be ceased long time before their daies.</P>
<P>Otherwaies, if it be vndoubtedlie true, that <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Diuels,</HI> either then or now are, and may be expelled by <HI>sole prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting:</HI> then surely, the worke it selfe (notwith|standing the force of your second reason) is vndoubtedly a <HI>miraculous worke,</HI> as in our ninth and tenth <HI>Dialogues</HI> verie plainely appeareth.</P>

<P>Then is it not the <HI>force of your prayer:</HI> but the <HI>absolute au|thoritie</HI> and power of <HI>Christ,</HI> that expelleth the <HI>Diuell.</HI> A thing very well knowen to Master <HI>Darell</HI> himselfe;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Detection, pag.</HI> 49.</NOTE>In deed I must and doe freely confesse, that <HI>faith</HI> also (in that selfesame admirable <HI>action</HI>) is necessarily required for the powerfull apprehending and applying of that absolute authoritie of <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then not any force <HI>of your prayer entreating,</HI> but the pow|er of your <HI>faith apprehending</HI> and applying the absolute au|thoritie of <HI>Christ,</HI> was the <HI>meanes</HI> alone that effected the worke: and so your pretended false meanes of <HI>sole prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> falles flat in the dust. But goe to, sith <HI>faith</HI> (as you say now) is required in that <HI>action</HI>; what <HI>manner of faith</HI> doe you meane? The <HI>miraculous faith</HI> is ceased you know: and the <HI>iustifying faith</HI> it may not possiblie be, as in our ninth <HI>Dialogue</HI> is plainely declared.

<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>This answere of yours is fearefullie fraught with manie <HI>irreligious and absurde assertions.</HI> For first you therein verie groslie bewray an vnspeakeable <HI>Pride:</HI> presuming to con|troll the abolute wisedome of the onlie wise <HI>God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 16.27.</NOTE> Who ha|uing instituted the onlie <HI>miraculous faith</HI> for the powerfull expelling of <HI>diuels:</HI> you your selfe doe proudly oppose your idle conceit to his said <HI>absolute wisdome,</HI> auouching very pre|sumptuouslie the <HI>iustifying faith</HI> farre <HI>better,</HI> and much more to be wished in this <HI>speciall case.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, you doe in the following speech very fondlie dallie with your former <HI>assertion.</HI> For if the <HI>temporarie,</HI> or the <HI>historicall faith</HI> may fullie suffice to the powerfull expelling of <HI>Satan,</HI> the supposed <HI>ordinarie meanes</HI> being vsed therwith: how should the <HI>iustifying faith</HI> be farre better, and much more to be wished in this speciall case?</P>
<P>Besides that, it is very <HI>absurd</HI> to auouch that <HI>the only histori|call faith</HI> may fullie suffice for doing the deed; because then one <HI>diuell</HI> may possiblie driue forth <HI>another:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iam.</HI> 2.19.</NOTE> for they haue the <HI>historicall faith,</HI> as fullie as the best of you all.

<P>Moreouer, whereas your selfe so confidentlie auouch, that the expelling of <HI>diuels</HI> by such your falsly pretended <HI>meanes,</HI> doth not stand so much in <HI>the faith of the person</HI> for that <HI>action</HI> imployed, as in the <HI>mercies of God</HI> apprehended there|by: you doe directly crosse M. <HI>Darel</HI> himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.

<P>It is very commendable to be <HI>confident in a good and com|mendable cause, both when you are present and absent.</HI> As for your present purpose in hand, it were much better to ac|knowledge the <HI>ignorance of your soule,</HI> and freelie to confesse that <HI>you hold a lie in your right hand:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccles.</HI> 4.25. <HI>Isa.</HI> 44.20.</NOTE> then with such setled pertinacie to persist (as you do) in your <HI>peeuish opinions,</HI> and thus <HI>blasphemouslie</HI> to prophane the <HI>Apostles</HI> speech concer|ning the infallible testimonie of an <HI>Angell from heauen.</HI> For hereby you giue all good men a iust occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 18.9.</NOTE> not onely to suspect very shrewdlie the <HI>sinceritie of your spirit:</HI> but also <HI>(af|ter twise or thrise admonition) to shew themselues very carefull in fleeing from your person,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit.</HI> 3.10.11.</NOTE> <HI>as from a man that sinneth, and persi|steth in sinning, you know very well how.</HI></P>

by sole prayer and fasting,</HI> as by a speciall <HI>ordinaunce</HI> established purposelie by our Sauiour <HI>Christ</HI> to that speciall purpose. And whether those men likewise, be not as faultie in the <HI>particular,</HI> who cannot (with any patience) endure, that the pretended <HI>possession</HI> and <HI>dispossession</HI> of those the fore|named <HI>persons</HI> (how absurd soeuer) should be impugned by any. Yea, and rather then any sound <HI>opposition of truth,</HI> to those their <HI>palpable vntruthes</HI> should gaine a publike pas|sage: they will (by all manner of meanes, directlie or indi|rectlie) contend for a most vaine and friuolous matter: namelie, that the said <HI>Sommers, Darling,</HI> and <HI>K.

<P>We will say no more concerning those matters, then that which we haue spoke~ before: namelie, that in manie of those your supposed vses, there are some thinges to too vnsound and absurd, as in some part of our <HI>answeres</HI> hath beene part|ly obserued.

<P>I doe no further reiect your said <HI>vses</HI> then their proper vnsoundnes, and want of sound matter to be grounded vp|on, doth necessarily require at my hands.

<P>Hence also it is, that the <HI>grosse headed papists</HI> doe so grosse|lie imagine <HI>a magicall force, in hoc est corpus meum:</HI> for the pre|sent <HI>transubstantiating of bread and wine,</HI> into the very <HI>natu|rall Body and Blood of Christ.</HI></P>

<P>That the daily rehearsal of their <HI>Ladies Psalter:</HI> doth pur|chase to themselues the <HI>remission of sinnes.</HI></P>

<P>Brieflie from hence also it is, that the <HI>Exorcists</HI> of euerie condition doe make <HI>sole prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting (ex opere operato)</HI> their onlie <HI>effectuall meanes</HI> for the powerfull expelling of <HI>diuels:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.

And that the holie <HI>exercise of prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> is made an <HI>ordina|ry medicine</HI> for euerie <HI>maladie:</HI> and the <HI>onelie salue</HI> for <HI>euerie sore.</HI> Whereby it commeth to passe that the most men (neg|lecting all other meanes els for their good) doe grieuouslie sinne in tempting the Lord: and (which more is) doe super|stitiouslie prophane the <HI>holie exercise of prayer and fasting.</HI></P>
<P>And (which is to be respected the most of all) they doe thereby very strongly confirme <HI>the wisards of the world</HI> in their <HI>wicked opinions,</HI> concerning the <HI>supposed force</HI> of those their <HI>filthie sorceries</HI> and <HI>magicall inchauntments:</HI> bearing the the world in hand, that (by the onlie <HI>meanes</HI> of their filthie <HI>charmes,</HI> their <HI>frame of words,</HI> their superstitious <HI>inuocations,</HI> and other their <HI>vnlawfull orisons</HI>) they are able (without any more adoe) to amend whatsoeuer is amisse in man or beast.</P>

<P>And as before the <HI>Law written</HI> from the very first <HI>creation,</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> obserued this <HI>method</HI> &amp; order in the orderly mani|festation of any his <HI>vnchangeable ordinances:</HI> so surely, both at,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mal.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Iam.</HI> 1.17.</NOTE> and <HI>after the giuing of the Law,</HI> there was in him <HI>no shadow of chaunge</HI> concerning that selfesame <HI>vnchaungeable course.</HI></P>
<P>For First, (hauing determined with himselfe (before all beginnings of time) to establish the <HI>Morall Law, as a perpe|tuall rule of perfect obedience</HI>) not onely he did (in very <HI>fitte</HI> time) make promise thereof to his people:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 15.16. <HI>Act</HI> 7.7. <HI>Exod.</HI> 12.40. <HI>Act.</HI> 7.38. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.17.</NOTE> but (which more is) after the <HI>full expiration of foure hundred and thirtie yeeres:</HI> (I meane, at the very appointed season it selfe) he did corre|spondently accomplish the same.</P>

<P>With very good will. Wherin especially we haue to consider, that seeing the <HI>matters</HI> we handle at large concerning these <HI>se|uerall points,</HI> are euery of them (as you haue heard) <HI>the infallible truthes of the Lord,</HI> and the same also most soundly confirmed by the very sway of <HI>sound reason,</HI> by the testimonie of <HI>fathers,</HI> and by the vndoubted <HI>auctoritie</HI> of the sacred <HI>Scriptures,</HI> not|withstanding (any thing hitherto written or said to the contra|rie) this <HI>Doctrine</HI> therefore of ours it ministreth a most <HI>christian admodition</HI> to all (especially the <HI>fauourits</HI> of this new-found <HI>diuillitie</HI>) to beware how they do ouer-rashlie iudge or con|demne any (how contemptible soeuer in their <HI>ouer-weening conceits</HI>) for <HI>Atheists, reuolters, formalists</HI> and <HI>irreligious per|sons,</HI> who either oppose themselues against, or (at least) do not fauour such <HI>phantasticall fooleries</HI> and fond conceites, as are lately broached abroade concerning these <HI>matters</HI> in question. Let men therefore beware how they doe ouer-rashly <HI>iudge, or condemne their brethren</HI> for these things, least haplie they be thought to oppose themselues not only against <HI>euident reason,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 5.35.39. <HI>and</HI> 7.51. 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.8.</NOTE> and the approued <HI>testimonie of auncient Fathers,</HI> but also a|gainst the <HI>infallible truths of the sacred scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>Besides that, let them further consider, that they cannot so rashlie <HI>speake euill</HI> of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iam.</HI> 4 11.12.</NOTE> and <HI>condemne their brethren</HI> in these points: but necessarilie they must <HI>speake euill of the law, and condemne the law,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 14 4.13.</NOTE> and so make themselues no <HI>obseruers,</HI> but <HI>iudges</HI> ouer the law, forgetting that there is but one <HI>law-gi|uer and iudge,</HI> who alone is able to saue and destroy. Yea, and so much the rather should wise men be willinglie admo|nished to beware of euerie such rash and <HI>inconsiderate cen|suring</HI> of others:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 15.18.19 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4.5.</NOTE> by how much they may easilie perceiue not onlie their <HI>corrupt inclination</HI> very prone thereto, but also the <HI>seuerall effects</HI> thereof to be very filthie and dangerous.</P>

Wherein wee haue first to consider, that for so much as all those the <HI>former conceits,</HI> which <HI>Exorcistes</HI> hath broached abroad, concerning <HI>these matters in question,</HI> are euery of them vndoubtedly such, as (notwithstanding any his <HI>glorious pretences</HI>) doe not onely not bring any one be|nefit to the <HI>Church in generall,</HI> or to any the <HI>particular mem|bers</HI> thereof: but doe rather tend couertly to the timely sup|port of his owne <HI>priuate purposes,</HI> without hauing relation to <HI>publike good</HI>; nay rather to the <HI>vntimely procuring</HI> of many <HI>publike and priuate mischiefes.</HI> The consideration hereof may serue to discouer those <HI>secret plots</HI> and <HI>vnder-hand practises,</HI> which our <HI>miracle-mongers</HI> (of what condition soeuer) doe mutually obserue among themselues <HI>with one harmonicall consent and course.</HI></P>
<P>For they all (in the very <HI>first progresse</HI> of any their <HI>plotted
<PB N="224" REF="127">
proceedings</HI>) doe <HI>primarily</HI> propound to themselues such pur|posed <HI>proiects,</HI> as they (notwithstanding any their outward <HI>iollie pretences</HI>) doe cunningly prosecute, and eftsoones ac|complish, by the <HI>secret meanes</HI> of many their <HI>vnder-hand practises,</HI> and iuggling sleights of <HI>legerdemaine</HI>: yea and this also with such a <HI>slie and nimble conueiance,</HI> as a man would hardly imagine, that not any other but <HI>May-butter</HI> it selfe could possiblie <HI>melt in their mouthes.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.5. <HI>Iud.</HI> 16.</NOTE>For these cunning <HI>practitioners,</HI> as they haue euermore had an <HI>insatiable thirst</HI> to the filthie <HI>pleasures</HI> and <HI>pelfe</HI> of the world, as to the onely <HI>true obiects</HI> of their hearts desire, and the very purposed <HI>proiects</HI> which they principally propound to themselues in any their <HI>vnder-hand practises,</HI> though they <HI>falsely make shew of a quite contrarie</HI> end, in all outward ap|pearance: so haue they their sundrie <HI>deuices</HI> to further their said enterprise, and to accomplish effectually that their <HI>pri|marie</HI> pretended purpose, wherein also they are resolutelie bent, notwithstanding any <HI>crossing occurrents</HI>; although yet with as little suspition as they possiblie may.</P>
<P>And therefore in the very <HI>first progresse</HI> of those their pro|ceedings, they solemnely pretend the <HI>glorie of God,</HI> the gra|cing of sundrie his <HI>sacred ordinances,</HI> and the singular great <HI>good of his Church.</HI> Namely, either an approbation of the <HI>real presence of Christ in their Masse,</HI> or a confirmation of <HI>publike fasts</HI> in those their solemne <HI>meetings:</HI> or a perpetuall esta|blishment of the <HI>worship of Saints,</HI> of <HI>Purgatorie,</HI> of <HI>Masses,</HI> of <HI>Trentals,</HI> of <HI>Dirges,</HI> of <HI>praying for the dead,</HI> of <HI>plodding</HI> on <HI>Pil|grimage,</HI> with tenne thousand such other deuices.</P>
<P>Howbeit (notwithstanding these wonderfull sturres) if wee more prouidently respect the <HI>full period</HI> of those their proceedings, wee may plainly perceiue that their <HI>primarie</HI> propounded <HI>pleasures</HI> and <HI>profits</HI> (which they hourely expect as an <HI>ordinarie interest,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.3. <HI>and</HI> 6.5. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.7. <HI>Iude</HI> 16. 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.2.</NOTE> successiuely arising from such <HI>colou|red courses</HI>) they are that <HI>quickening spirit</HI> which only affoor|deth life and <HI>motion</HI> to those their <HI>entended actions:</HI> yea, and that onely <HI>preexisting efficient</HI> which giues an <HI>essentiall forme</HI> to all their purposes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iob.</HI> 15.31. <HI>Psalm.</HI> 7.14. <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.4.</NOTE> and without which their <HI>vnder-hand practises</HI> would become an <HI>vntimely birth,</HI> would quickly <HI>va|nish away</HI> of themselues, and forthwith come vnto <HI>nothing.</HI></P>

<P>Againe, in that the <HI>outragious flames of this wild-fire,</HI> which at the very first beginning of all so vniuersallie and so feare|fullie <HI>ouerspread it selfe,</HI> are now so quietlie calmed by the <HI>cooling streames of iustice,</HI> so forciblie suppressing the same: this tendeth very notablie (you see) to the singular <HI>commen|dation</HI> of those our <HI>superiours,</HI> who so timely tooke <HI>notice of,</HI> so seriouslie <HI>enquired into,</HI> so iudiciallie <HI>proceeded against,</HI> and with such holie perseuerance <HI>persisted constantlie</HI> in the ne|cessarie <HI>restraint,</HI> and timelie <HI>stoppage of all those outragious courses,</HI> which the <HI>busie headed broachers</HI> of such <HI>idle conceits,</HI> were so vndutifullie entred into, by the onlie instigation of their owne <HI>itching humour,</HI> without eyther due regard to the <HI>glorie of God,</HI> or any <HI>respect</HI> of the <HI>Churches good.</HI> Yea, and (which more is) the <HI>magistrates</HI> singular <HI>care</HI> is so much the more highlie commended, by how much an vrgent necessi|tie (in this erronious and reeling age of the world) required

<P>Moreouer, in that so many grosse and <HI>palpable absurdities</HI> do not only arise from this new-found <HI>Diuillitie</HI> (as hath bin declared at large) but which more is, do couertlie <HI>trudge vp and downe</HI> from hand to hand, and are too <HI>careleslie entertained</HI> a|mong the simpler sort, as necessarie, fruitfull, and most currant <HI>conceits,</HI> to the intolerable <HI>scandalizing</HI> of manie, the high <HI>dishonor of God,</HI> the vndoubted <HI>preiudice of that supereminent power of Iesus Christ ouer Spirits and Diuels,</HI> to the <HI>palpable ob|scuring</HI> of such speciall <HI>promises</HI> as more especially concerne those speciall <HI>points,</HI> to the fearefull <HI>prophanation of prayer and fasting,</HI> to the <HI>dredful endaungering</HI> of the poore people of <HI>God,</HI> to the <HI>needles confirmations</HI> of <HI>popish adiurations, Exorcizings,</HI> and <HI>coniurings of Spirits and Diuels,</HI> to the dayly <HI>propagation of atheisme, epicurisme,</HI> and <HI>irreligious opinions</HI> among the propha|ner sort.

<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my hart. Wherein we haue first to consider, that seeing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound truth of this doctrine we teach,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 3.4. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.3. <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.24. 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.5. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.18.</NOTE> hath (in euery age of the world) bin so mightily vndermined by Sathan him|selfe, and so dangerously darkened by such seducing compani|ons, as (accompting glorie or gaine the greatest godlines) do endeuour to <HI>withhold the veritie it selfe in vnrighteousnes,</HI> and
<PB N="233" REF="131">
to turne the <HI>manifest truth of God into a mysticall lye.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 8.25.</NOTE> This therefore, it tendeth very notably (you see) to the timely com|mendation and comfort of all such sound harted Christians, as (notwithstanding these encountring occurrents) are not lightly carried about with euery vaine blast of deceiueable doctrines,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 4.24. <HI>Iam.</HI> 1.8.</NOTE> from the sinceritie and soundnes of that sacred faith, which they firmely hold in Iesus Christ:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> but do rather very circumspectlie watch, most couragiouslie stand fast in the faith, to too vali|antly quite themselues like valorous souldiers; are vnconque|rablie strong against principalities and powers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eph.</HI> 6.12. 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.8.</NOTE> against the worldly gouernours, euen the princes of the darkenes of this world,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Phil.</HI> 1.27.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> against spirituall wickednesses in the high place: yea and (which more is) do euen fight together in one faith of the Gospell, not fearing the outragious force of their aduersaries how many or how mightie soeuer, which is vndoubtedly vnto their aduersaries a token of perdition, but vnto them a signe of saluation, and that also of God.</P>
<P>Surely such their sound persisting in the puritie of <HI>faith,</HI> as it argueth no small measure of grace: so doth it freelie afoord the~ a singular meditation of <HI>spirituall comfort,</HI> so oft as they (in the middest of this reeling and wauering world) be soundly tou|ched with the due consideration of that their setled constancie.</P>

<P>These <HI>vses</HI> they are euery way so pertinent, and so conso|nant to the substance of the <HI>doctrine</HI> it selfe, as none but the headie and obstinate (who hauing with a setled pertinacie euen secretly and finally deuoted themselues to their selfe-conceit) will any waies mislike or impugne the same. But what saith <HI>Exorcistes</HI> vnto them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>I neither could, nor would willingly be opposite to them, especially if the <HI>Doctrine</HI> it selfe, from whence they are
<PB N="236" REF="133">
drawne, were so currantly sound, as Master <HI>Orthodoxus</HI> and the rest would beare me in hand.</P>
<P>Howbeit (notwithstanding any thing hitherto heard) I am, and must still be in the selfe same <HI>opinion</HI> I was in at the first. For if none (in these daies) be <HI>essentially possessed of Satan,</HI> do tel me (I pray you) how we are to esteeme of such extra|ordinarie <HI>actions</HI> or <HI>passions,</HI> as do eftsoones befall to sundrie distressed <HI>persons?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will simplie tell you what my owne selfe suppose them to be, and how also I would haue your selfe and all others accompt of such accidents.</P>
<P>First, such extraordinarie and vnwonted occurrents may eftsoones appeare, and be practised by meere <HI>cousoning col|lusions,</HI> and craftie conueiances of <HI>legerdemaine.</HI> Yea, and these counterfeite <HI>actions</HI> or <HI>passions</HI> may also bee broached, either by the only pretended <HI>Demoniake</HI> himselfe (as did the <HI>dissembling caitife,</HI> who cousoned that reuerend father Master <HI>Fox</HI>) without the assistance of any other besides: or else such extraordinarie actions they may be effected by the ioynt assistance, helpe and direction of some <HI>craftie confederate,</HI> conioyned with that the aforesaid pretended <HI>Demoniake,</HI> in the couert dispatch of those his counterfeit <HI>prankes.</HI> Of this kinde of <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> the world hath been successiuely pe|stered in euery age since the <HI>Primitiue Church:</HI> and therefore no wonder at all though now (in these daies) some certaine persons should likewise <HI>depart from the faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.1. 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.3.4. <HI>Iud.</HI> 1.18.19.</NOTE> <HI>giuing heede to spirits of error, and to doctrines of Diuels.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes againe the pretended <HI>Demoniake</HI> may (in deed and in truth) be easily drawen to beleeue that he is (without doubt) <HI>essentially possessed of Satan,</HI> when there is no such mat|ter at all, he hauing onely (at vnwares to himselfe) and by some <HI>paltrie Priest</HI> or cunning <HI>Impostor</HI>) beene before verie grosly abused; partly by Patheticall and circumuenting perswasions, and partly also by some intoxicated perfume, some filthie confection or potion. The which bewitching sorceries doe so strangely disorder the poore <HI>Patients body,</HI> his <HI>minde</HI> it selfe with all the powers and faculties concer|ning them both:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 8.9.</NOTE> as (for the present) the very <HI>beholders</HI> them|selues are easily perswaded (with the people of <HI>Samaria</HI>) to
<PB N="237" REF="133">
beleeue that the partie (in deed) is <HI>essentially possessed.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 8.9.10.</NOTE> Yea and (which more is) the very <HI>Exorcist</HI> himselfe (who pretendeth and vndertaketh the supposed <HI>dispossession</HI> of this newly sup|posed <HI>Demoniake</HI>) he may also very easily beare the <HI>behol|ders</HI> in hand, that he is vndoubtedly some mightie <HI>Magni|fico</HI> in this new-found trade of <HI>Diuillitie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 8.9.10.</NOTE> and make them thus to crie out fro~ the least to the most; <HI>Doubtlesse this man is the great power of God.</HI> Of this kind of <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> as also of that the <HI>intoxicated potion</HI> it selfe: the <HI>Iesuiticall Exorcists</HI> (in their <HI>Exorcising pamphlets</HI>) they affoord vs sundry <HI>examples.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly these <HI>extraordinarie</HI> and vnwonted <HI>occurrents,</HI> they may and doe also eftsoones arise from meere <HI>naturall causes,</HI> namely, from <HI>Mania,</HI> from <HI>Melancholy,</HI> from <HI>Lunacy,</HI> from <HI>Furie,</HI> from the <HI>Phrensie,</HI> from the <HI>Epilepsie,</HI> from the <HI>Mother,</HI> from <HI>Conuulsions, obstructions,</HI> and sundry such other <HI>vnnaturall accidents,</HI> as we haue eftsoones declared in our former <HI>discourses.</HI></P>
<P>By the <HI>vnwontednes</HI> and efficacie of which vnnaturall in|firmities, the <HI>minde</HI> it selfe (being mightily disordered be|fore by meanes of the <HI>Phantasie</HI>) doth easily resolue that some <HI>extraordinarie operations</HI> of <HI>Satan</HI> doe mightilie dis|temper his <HI>natural constitution,</HI> and strangely afflict the same in euery part. Of this kind of extraordinarie <HI>actions</HI> or <HI>pas|sions</HI> very many but lately departed this life, and many yet liuing haue oftentimes had an experience: yea and the best vse you may possibly make of all those your eight supposed <HI>Demoniakes</HI> (more especially of your newly pretended <HI>Pa|tients</HI> sprong vp in <HI>Cheshire</HI> of late) is only this. Namely, that the excesse of <HI>melancholy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By the view of the Phisition his Bill, wee per|ceiued that his iudgement con|cerning the boy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was onlie an ex|cesse of some melancholie.</HI></NOTE> or some other disordered <HI>hu|mour,</HI> did (for the present) disorder their bodies, according to the approued iudgement of learned <HI>Physitions,</HI> concer|ning especially the <HI>boye</HI> at <HI>Northwitch.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, the <HI>Diuell</HI> (being alwaies desirous to worke (a|mong the deare children of <HI>God</HI>) the greatest <HI>disturbance</HI> that may be, and finding withall some such lewd disposed <HI>person</HI> as is naturally enclined to all manner of <HI>knaueries</HI>) he taketh the oportunitie of so fit a <HI>subiect,</HI> and worketh so cunningly vpon the <HI>corruption</HI> of <HI>that lewd persons nature,</HI> as the <HI>partie</HI> himselfe is easily brought to beleeue, and to beare others al|so in hand, that he is (in deede and in truth) <HI>essentially posses|sed
<PB N="238" REF="134">
of Satan.</HI> Yea, and (which more is) the said <HI>vngratious body</HI> (partly for <HI>gaine,</HI> partly for <HI>glory,</HI> and partly also in <HI>an affected desire</HI> to be deemed <HI>terrible</HI> to others about him) he doth from thence forth very willingly endeuour himselfe to <HI>speake</HI> and <HI>to act some</HI> such strange and vnwonted <HI>acts,</HI> as the like were neuer espied in him before. By which his <HI>villa|nous practises,</HI> the silly <HI>beholders</HI> (surprised before with an in|ueterate opinion of <HI>Demoniacall possessions</HI>) are easily brought to intertaine for infallible truth, that the <HI>partie</HI> is (in deed) <HI>essentiallie possessed</HI> with some <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Diuell.</HI> Of this kinde of <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> we haue often <HI>experience</HI> in euery age: and the cousoning of good Master <HI>Foxe</HI> doth plainely confirme.</P>
<P>By the <HI>premisses</HI> then you may plainely perceiue, that the supposed strange <HI>actions</HI> or <HI>passions,</HI> in any such falslie preten|ded <HI>Demoniakes,</HI> they may, and are also eftsoones effected without any <HI>supernaturall power of a Diuell:</HI> and therefore you neede not so easilie be ledde to conceiue of those mat|ters in such sort as you doe, but ought rather to examine the <HI>causes</HI> themselues with the sundrie <HI>occasions</HI> and <HI>seuerall cir|cumstances</HI> of <HI>persons,</HI> of <HI>times,</HI> and of <HI>places</HI> with other <HI>occur|rents:</HI> that thereby you may more soundly be able to deter|mine thereof.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lycanthropus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely sir (these <HI>Cautions</HI> and <HI>considerations</HI> being duely obserued) there could not possibly be such <HI>contrarietie of opi|nions</HI> concerning these matters, as now are rashly broached abroad to the intolerable disturbance of the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Church.</HI> But what saith <HI>Exorcistes</HI> to all these matters?</P>

<P>Master <HI>Orthodoxus,</HI> our endeuour to do the man good, I perceiue is vtterly lost.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orthodoxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like very well of your motion, and will therefore ac|cordingly put downe the <HI>seuerall Questions</HI> in this follow|ing order.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Whether now</HI> (in this last age of the world) <HI>there be es|sentiall possessions and dispossessions of Diuels?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Whether sole Prayer and Fasting be an vndoubted true ordinance of Christ, for the powerfull expelling of Diuels to the ende of the world?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Whether</HI> (if any be truely dispossessed by sole prayer and fasting) <HI>that selfesame dispossession be not indeed a miracu|lous worke?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Whether the working of miracles be yet still in vse in these daies of the Gospell?</HI></P>
<P>Behold <HI>Exorcistes?</HI> these <HI>Questions</HI> (you see) they fully containe <HI>the whole scope of our conference:</HI> doe take them therefore to your <HI>fauourits,</HI> that they and your selfe may more soundly consider vpon them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Exorcistes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your <HI>questions</HI> sir, they haue been <HI>viewed,</HI> and <HI>reuiewed,</HI> by a <HI>graue</HI> and <HI>reuerend Preacher,</HI> who saith they be <HI>friuolous,</HI> vnworthie the <HI>consideration</HI> of any, and such as hee <HI>scorned to answere.</HI></P>
