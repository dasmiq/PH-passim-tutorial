<HEAD>THE
EPISTLE
To the
READER.</HEAD>
<P>_EPistles Dedicatory, and long Prefaces are of late
much in Request; no Person of Quality, how
remote soever, can escape the Impertinences of
<HI>Poets;</HI> for though they be Hundreds of Miles off,
they shall be pursu'd, and persecuted with De|dicatories
o're and o're, even by the same Au|thors:
which is a scurvy Compliment, like that
of desiring a Man to be God-Father to every Child that is
Born, though their Neighbours perhaps Club'd to the getting
them; These Troubles, liberal Patrons, and kind God-Fathers,
draw on themselves: But this is excusable in them that Write
for <HI>Bread,</HI> and Live by <HI>Dedications,</HI> and <HI>Third-Dayes.</HI> If once
in a Year they meet not with a good Audience, or a Bountiful
<HI>Moecenas,</HI> we are to expect no <HI>Play</HI> from them the next; because
they want Money to keep the great Wits company; from
whose Conversation, once in Twelve Months, they pick up a
<HI>Comedy.</HI> Yet this sort of Writers, or Wit-Collectors, are
Bloodily angry, if you will not allow all the Wit in their <HI>Playes</HI>
to be their own; and if they see another Man's <HI>Play</HI> take, Sware
<PB REF="3">
and Bluster, and Bite their Nails; that you'd wonder how
they do to Scratch their Heads, to bring forth the next: But I
suppose their Nails soon grow agen, and so that's no great
Harme. This sort of Men you shall hear say in the Pit, and at
the <HI>Coffee-House</HI> (speaking of an Author) Dam me! How can
he Write! He's a Raw Young Fellow, newly come from the
<HI>University;</HI> How can he understand Humour or Character that
is just come from a <HI>Colledge?</HI> Of another they Cry, S'death, he's
no Scholler; he can't Write true <HI>Grammar:</HI> Then strutting,
and looking Big; S'blood, sayes he, I understand <HI>Greek,</HI> as you
may see by the Quotations in my <HI>Preface,</HI> and at the Front of
my last New <HI>Play:</HI> But if they can neither Talk, nor Write a
Young <HI>Poet</HI> out of the Humour of Making <HI>Playes,</HI> they give him
o're for a peremptory Fop&punc; and so fall to writing Siedges and O|pera's&mdash;</P>
<P>But, <HI>Reader,</HI> lest by the ensuing <HI>Prologue,</HI> thou should'st think
Me one of that Envious Tribe; know it was Written in Re|quital
to the <HI>Prologue,</HI> before the <HI>Assignation, or Love in a Nunne|ry,</HI>
and not without Provocation, <HI>Laesit prius:</HI> But Devils of Wit
are not very dangerous, and so we both sleep in whole Skins.</P>
<P>If you are Inquisitive to know why there are such continual
Picques amongst the <HI>Poets,</HI> I can give you no other Reason than
what one Whore told the other&mdash;<HI>Two of a Trade can seldome
agree</HI>&mdash;Now by way of Excuse for this <HI>Comedy,</HI> let me ac|quaint
you, that it was written at the Desire of the Young Men
of the <HI>Stage,</HI> and given them for a <HI>Lenten Play;</HI> they ask't it not
above a Week before <HI>Shrove-Tuesday:</HI> In three dayes time, the
Three first Act&punc; were Made, Transcrib'd, and given them to
write out in Parts&mdash;The Two last Acts, took me up just so
much time&punc; one Week compleated it. If this will not excuse it,
Thou art as Uncons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">onable and Malicious as the Writing <HI>Cri|ticks,</HI>
who say all they can for themselves, and will hear nothing
in Defence of others. But I would not have <HI>Poets</HI> make this a
President; for shortness of Time ought not to be pleaded in ex|cuse
of Ill <HI>Playes,</HI> unless on the like Occasion: For the Town I
am sure will allow a Man ten Months, nay, ten Years, rather
<PB REF="3">
than ten Dayes, if he will but bring a good One at last. I have
much more to say, and as little to the Purpose, as any thing the
best of my Fellow-<HI>Poets</HI> have said; but I'le consider on't a while,
and some other time, when I have more Leisure, you shall have
it; till then, <HI>Reader</HI>&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THey that observe the Humors of the <HI>Stage,</HI></L>
<L>Find <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Heroes</HI> best do please this Age,</L>
<L>But both grown so extravagant, I scarce</L>
<L>Can tell, if <HI>Fool</HI> or <HI>Hero</HI> makes the better Farce:</L>
<L>As for Example, take our <HI>Mamamouchi,</HI></L>
<L>And then <HI>Almansor,</HI> that so much did touch ye;</L>
<L>That Bully <HI>Hero,</HI> that did kill and slay,</L>
<L>And conquer ye <HI>Ten Armies</HI> in one day:</L>
<L>He that from side to side play'd <HI>Runnegade,</HI></L>
<L>That Fought and Lov'd as if he had been mad.</L>
<L>He that gain'd Victory at ev'ry Stroke,</L>
<L>And made Kings tremble at each Word he spoke;</L>
<L>He that could Kill and Damne you with a Look.</L>
<L>Such are the <HI>Heroes,</HI> that with you are taking,</L>
<L>But such as never were of Heavens making:</L>
<L>Thus, whether <HI>Grave</HI> or <HI>Comick</HI> Scenes we write,</L>
<L>All's turn'd to <HI>Farce,</HI> by <HI>Hero,</HI> or by <HI>Knight.</HI></L>
<L>Without one of these Two it is decree'd</L>
<L>By all of you, that no <HI>Play</HI> shall succeed.</L>
<L>An <HI>Author</HI> did to please you, let his Wit run</L>
<L>Of late, much on a <HI>Serving-Man</HI> and <HI>Cittern,</HI></L>
<L>And yet you would not like the <HI>Cerenade,</HI></L>
<L>Nay, and you Damn'd his <HI>Nun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> in <HI>Masquerade.</HI></L>
<L>You did his <HI>Spanish</HI> Sing-Song too abhor,</L>
<L>Ayeque locura con tanto rigor.</L>
<L>In fine, the whole by you so much was blam'd,</L>
<L>To act their Parts, the <HI>Players</HI> were asham'd;</L>
<L><PB REF="4">
Ah! how severe your Malice was that Day,</L>
<L>To Damne at once, the <HI>Poet</HI> and his <HI>Play;</HI></L>
<L>But why, was your Rage just at that time shown,</L>
<L>When what the <HI>Poet</HI> writ, was all his own?</L>
<L>Till then he borrow'd from <HI>Romance,</HI> and did Translate,</L>
<L>And those <HI>Playes</HI> found a more Indulgent Fate.</L>
<L>We fear you'l be incens'd again to day,</L>
<L>But consider, our's is a <HI>Lenten</HI> Play.</L>
<L>It was on purpose for the <HI>Young Men</HI> writ,</L>
<L>And all that's in it is <HI>Extempore</HI> Wit.</L>
<L>The <HI>Poet</HI> sayes, because he did not aime</L>
<L>At Credit, that he cannot meet with shame;</L>
<L>We <HI>Young-Men</HI> too, hope to be free from Blame;</L>
<L>For we do not design to please the Town</L>
<L>So much, as to get ev'ry Mans Half-crown:</L>
<L>And boldly we presume, that your Intent</L>
<L>Of coming now is for Encouragement.</L>
<L>Resolve then to be Kind to Us to Day,</L>
<L>And if You will, to Morrow, Damne the <HI>Play.</HI></L>

<P>Unconscionable Man! I tell thee
I am going to see my Mistress.</P>

<SPEAKER>Carel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pox o'thy Mistress; if thou

thee; But I should think my self Damn'd, shou'd I consent
to thy going to sollicit any Woman in the Way of <HI>Matrimony.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wilt thou never leave this lewd wild Humour?</P>

<SPEAKER>Carel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not upon the score of <HI>Matrimony;</HI> Why, <HI>Iack
Lovell,</HI> I'le tell thee I'am now like a Colt in the <HI>Fenns,</HI> that
stragles every where, and feed where I like best: But shou'd
I Marry, I shou'd be tether'd to my Spot of ground; at best,
confin'd to an Inclosure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But the Horse that is loose often falls into a foul
Ditch; or is put in the Pound for 'straying into his Neigh|bours

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; if all Wives were honest, I'le undertake a
Miss shall love thee twice as long as any Wife thou can'st

find; nothing choaks Love like the Surety of Possession;
Love is an excellent Meat, but Marriage is an ill Sauce; and
believe me, it is the worst Estate of Mankind. If I was go|ing
to <HI>Tyburne,</HI> I wou'd cry, <HI>Drive on Carman;</HI> and choose

<P>No; such Women as your Mistress is, are more like
Jilts. These are good Conscionable Girles, that will not let you
spend your Money for nothing with the others; you waste your
Gold and Time, and at last, like young Heifers when they
come to be milk'd, they Spurn at you in Defiance, and away
they frisk.</P>

<P>It is the great Care and Love I have for thee, makes

me solicitous to see thee well-dispos'd. My Lord is a Person
of Worth and Honour, and thou wilt be happy in his Love;
<HI>Iacinta</HI> thou'lt be a Lady&mdash;</P>

<P>My Lord merits, I question not, a Wife much above

brought me up to what I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muchw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Mother did the same before You; and for this
thou hast had all thy Education: This is the last great Act a
Father can do for his Child; in this his Care ends, and when
we give a Daughter in Marriage, 'tis suppos'd, we give her to
more than a Father, for such is a Husband; Husband and Wife
are one.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay Uncle, ner'e put on your Considering-Cap, for
an Answer. What I say is true; and I'le give you a further De|monstration,
that Man and Wife are not one: For in this Age
they are seldom, or never together; the Man's in one place, and
the Wise in another&punc; as far asunder as ever they can get. And
you know it is impossible for one and the same thing to be at the
same time in several places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muchw.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has a very unhappy Wit. I am glad, Daughter,
that you are going from her, for she's enough to spoil all the
Young Women she meets with; but I hope she'l have a Husband
will meet with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never of your Choosing, Uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muchw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Likely so, for you'r Hair-brain'd enough, to do things
of your own Head. But your Father when he Dy'd, left you
to my Care, and bid that you shou'd be Rul'd by me; and if
you are not, your Disobedience will come home to you one day
or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is but talk. Do you think, Uncle, I han't as much
Wit to choose a Husband as you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Muchw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, follow your own Course; but I hope
<PB N="33" REF="17">
you'l get a Husband one day will Cudgel your Bones for
you.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Uncle, it is not now as it was in your young dayes,
Women then were poor sneaking sleepish Creatures. But in
this Age, we know our own strength, and have wit enough
to make use of our Talents. If I meet with a Husband makes
my Heart ake, I'le make his Head ake I'le warrant him.</P>
</SP>

<P>Nay, I am apt enough to believe one house will be

of you as I am.</P>

<P>Yes: just as a Husband does when his Wife jogg'd me by

<P>MR. Doctor, I desire no more of your Consultations
with my Neice; I say no more, but I smell a
Fox.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say no more: but some Wiser than some.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Boast.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Sir, was the very reason, why the Doctor
brought me with him, thinking I might observe some Cir|cumstances
which might discover the Nature of your Neices
Disease, of which he yet remains doubtful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tob.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you discover'd, that it was good for her to go A|broad
in a Coach, to take the Air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Boast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, and I'le give you a Reason for't; for want
of Exercise the Bloud grows thick, and corrupts in the Veins,
which are the Channels Nature has design'd for: Sir, does it
not stand to reason, that Motion and Exercise which opens the
Veins, rarifies the Bloud, and gives it a free Passage; should it
not in some measure work it's Effects on your Neice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I say no more, but that some are Fools, and
some are Physicians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Boast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will maintain it against the Learned'st Professors
in Town, that it will do your Neice more good to Joult about
one Hour in a Coach every Morning and Evening for a
Month, than to take Ten Purges a day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much of your mind, Mr. Doctor; and I say no more,
but that it is not good for Sick Folks to go abroad in the
Air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="33">
<SPEAKER>D. Boast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Sickness is for want of Air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tob.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I say no more, but that some peoples reasons for her
going Abroad, is, that she's an Heiress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Boast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you don't think that I am an Instrument in any
Designe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say no more, but that there are Blades upon the Ran|dan,
that would Feel her Pulse, and stir her Bloud to some
purpose; and that's one reason why 'tis not good for her to go
Abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Boast.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Pardon, Sir, I spoke as a Physician in
Consideration of her Health, and Mr. Doctor within was part|ly
of my mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tob.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was of the mind too, that my Cook-maid wou'd not
dye yesterday: and I say no more, but that she dyed within two
hours after.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Boast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Physicians sometimes say what they think will best
please their Patients.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tob.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you thought 'twould please her best to be Gadding
abroad; I say no more, but that if her Bloud want stirring, I'le get
her a Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Boast.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, that will do best of all.</P>

<SP>

<P>Sir, Then we agree at last: and I say no more, but that
his Lordship shall go without her.</P>

<P>What Lord, Sir?</P>

<P>A Friend, a Neighbour of mine sends me word, that
she's in Love with a Foolish Fantastick Lord.</P>

<P>What is this Lord?</P>

<P>If what you say, be true, Why do most Husbands in

away their Wives, and keep Wenches? at least, those that are
so Civil to keep a Wife, they keep a Mistress besides?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if it be not true, Why do the great Wenchers at
last forsake all their Mistresses for a Wife? for, we find most of
them Marry at the Long-run; Nay, generally they prove the
best Husbands: And the reason is, they have experimented the
Folly of that Lewd Course of Life.</P>

<P>I will inform your Lordship who your Wife is, as

three Mistresses, of which, one of 'em was very young and very
pretty, and but newly debauch'd: I thought it great pity, she
should drive that Trade: and therefore advis'd her, to get her
a Husband before she had quite ruin'd her Credit: to advance
her Design, she took the Name of Alderman <HI>Rich</HI>'s Niece, and
this morning took the same Lodging too; and, by the Story, I
guess, this must be She you have married.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,
By Mr. Settle.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>GAllants, 'tis fear'd, after our last Loud <HI>Play,</HI></L>
<L>You will be Deaf to all Low Wit can say.</L>
<L>Light'ning, <HI>Machine</HI> and <HI>Noyse</HI> your Favourites are.</L>
<L>Those Murdering <HI>Playes,</HI> the <HI>Stage's</HI> Men of War,</L>
<L>Drive all before 'um, like an <HI>English</HI> Fleet:</L>
<L>All's Prize that in their Thunders-reach they meet;</L>
<L>Their mighty First-Rate Strength so great appears;</L>
<L>We Younger Actors seem but Privateers:</L>
<L>And like true Pickroons, this time we choose;</L>
<L>Where the Great Ships lye by, the Capers Cruze.</L>
<L>Yet we engage with full as much Devotion,</L>
<L>Tho' with less Hope, and far less Execution.</L>
<L>How e're we' Adventurers so little Stake,</L>
<L>'Tis all clear Profit whatsoe're we Take;</L>
<L>Whil'st they from the large Booty they had got,</L>
<L>Pay <HI>Tribute</HI> to the <HI>Force</HI> that Set them out:</L>
<L>As if Gay <HI>Playes,</HI> like <HI>Navies,</HI> had this Check,</L>
<L>In a Rich Prize to Plunder but one Deck.</L>
<L>Yet their Fame's greater, tho' their Gain be less,</L>
<L>You kindly say, they merited Success.</L>
<L><PB REF="44">
Their Triumphs so much above ours prevail,</L>
<L>You'l own, they Won your Money, which we steal.</L>
<L>They Conquer a more Honourable way;</L>
<L>Their Spoyls are Victory, and ours but Prey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now has our Damn'd dull <HI>Epilogue</HI> ill us'd you;</L>
<L>I'me sure, it has not pleas'd; that is, abus'd you.</L>
<L>&mdash;But that small Fault to Day</L>
<L>May be excus'd, we've don't enough inth' <HI>Play.</HI></L>
