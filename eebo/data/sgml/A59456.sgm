<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe success, of this Play, as it was much
more then it deserv'd, so was much
more than I expected: Especially in this
very Critical age, when every man pre|tends
to be a Judge, and some, that never
read Three Playes in their lives, and never understood
one, are as positive in their Judgement of Playes, as if
they were all <HI>Iohnsons.</HI> But had I been us'd with all
the severity imaginable, I should patiently have sub|mitted
to my Fate; not like the rejected Authors of
our time, who when their&punc; Playes are damn'd, will
strut, and huff it out, and laugh at the Ignorance of
the Age: Or like some other of our Modern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
that declare they are resolv'd to justifie their Playes
with their Swords (though perhaps their Courage is
as little as their Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> such as peep through their loop-holes

Composer and the Dancing-Master are the best Poets,
and yet the unmerciful Scribler would rob the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> of
all the Honour.</P>
<P>I am so far from valuing my self (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">)
upon this Play, that perhaps no man is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">
of it then my self; yet if any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">
made me proud of it, It would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">
Favour and Countenance it receiv'd from His Majesty
and their Royal Highnesses.</P>
<P>But I could not perswade my self that they were so
favourable to the Play for the Merit of it, but ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a
Princely Generosi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y, to encourage a young<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">beginner,

of my own merits in it, as one ought to be
who receives an Alms.</P>
<P>The first hint I receiv'd was from the report of a
Play of <HI>Moli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">res</HI> of three Acts, called <HI>Les Fasch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">x&punc;</HI>
upon which I wrote a great part of this before I read
that; And after it came to my hands, I found so little
for my use (having before upon that hint design'd

reckon their stolne goods their own too&punc; which
is so ignoble a thing, that I cannot but believe that
he that makes a common practice of stealing other
mens Witt, would, if he could, with the same safety
steale any thing else.</P>
<P>I have in this Play, as neer as I could, observed
the three Unities, of Time, Place, and Action; The
time of the Drama does not exceed six houres, the
place is in a very narrow Compass, and the Main-Acti|on
of the Play, upon which all the rest depend, is the
Sullen-Love betwixt <HI>Stanford</HI> and <HI>Emilia,</HI> which kind
of love is onely proper to their Characters: I have
here, as often as I could naturally, kept the Scenes
unbroken, which (though it be not so much practi|sed,
or so well understood, by the <HI>English</HI>) yet a|mong
the French-Poets is accompted a great Beauty;
but after these frivolous excuses the want of design in
the Play has been objected against me; which fault
(though I may endeavour a little to extenuate) I
<PB REF="6">
dare not absolutely deny: I conceive, with all sub|mission
to better Judgments, that no man ought to
expect such Intrigues in the little actions of Come|dy,
as are requir'd in Playes of a higher Nature: but
in Playes of Humour, where there are so many Cha|racters
as there are in this, there is yet less design to be
expected: for, if after I had form'd three or four forward
prating Fopps in the Play, I had made it full of Plott,
and Business; at the latter end, where the turnes
ought to be many, and suddenly following one ano|ther,
I must have let fall the humour, which I thought
wou'd be pleasanter then Intrigues could have been
without it; and it would have been easier to me
to have made a Plott then to hold up the Hu|mour.</P>
<P>Another Objection, that has been made by
some, is, that there is the same thing over and over:
which I do not apprehend, unless they blame the
unity of the action, yet <HI>Horace de Arte Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tica,</HI>
sayes,
<Q>Sit quod vis, simplex duntaxat, &amp; unum.</Q>
Or whether it be the carrying on of the humours
to the last, which the same Author directs me to
doe.

<P><PB REF="6">I have endeav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">r'd to represent variety of Hu|mour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
(most of the persons of the <HI>Play</HI> differing
in their Characters from one another) which was
the practise of <HI>Ben Iohnson,</HI> whom I think all Dram|matick

ever read, either have wilde Romantick <HI>Tales,</HI>
wherein they strein Love and Honour to that Ridi|culous
height, that it becomes Burlesque: or in
their lower Comoedies content themselves with one
or two Humours at most, and those not near so
perfect Characters as the admirable <HI>Iohnson</HI> alwayes
made, who never wrote Comedy without seven
or eight considerable Humours. I never saw one
except that of <HI>Falstaffe</HI> that was in my judgment
comparable to any of <HI>Iohnson</HI>'s considerable Hu|mours:
You will pardon this digression when I tell
you he is the man, of all the World, I most pas|sionately
admire for his Excellency in Dramma|tick-<HI>Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>Though I have known some of late so Insolent
to say, that <HI>Ben Iohnson</HI> wrote his best <HI>Playes</HI> with|out
Wit; imagining, that all the Wit in <HI>Playes</HI> con|sisted
in bringing two persons upon the Stage to break
Jests, and to bob one another, which they call Repar|tie,

way of Writing.</P>
<P>But, perhaps you may think me as impertinent as
any one I represent; that, having so many faults of
my own, shou'd take the liberty to Judge of others,
to impeach my fellow Criminalls: I must confess it
is very ungenerous to accuse those that modestly con|fess

all their faults, are Common Enemies, that no man

you will easily pardon it; especially when you know
that the best of our Drammatick Writers have wrote
very ill <HI>Playes</HI> at first, nay some of e'm have wrote se|veral
