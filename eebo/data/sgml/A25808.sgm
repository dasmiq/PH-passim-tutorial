<OPENER><SALUTE>Noble Gent.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT was the happinesse of my starres, to have known you long ago, as the very Eye of our Garden of <HI>England;</HI> all which both admire and love you: And it is the height of my ambition, to salute your hands, that love Honesty, with the Comedical advancement of Honesty. I am confident, what <HI>Aristophanes</HI> and his <HI>Translator</HI> have pen|cill'd in this kind, you love to own, though drawn out in a weak Sci|ography. But you had rather see it performed in mens lives, then personated on the Stage; rather represented in action, then acted in speculative representations. I crave your courteous Patronage, suffi|cient Panoply even against Envy it self. I prostrate it to your judi|cious Test (at vacant houres) to approve of, and of my self too, who am</P>

<P>THis is a pleasant Comedy, though some may judge it Sa|tyrical: 'Tis the more like <HI>Aristophanes</HI> the Father: be|sides, if it be biting, 'tis a biting Age we live in; Then biting for biting. Again, <HI>Tom Randal,</HI> the Adopted Sonne of <HI>Ben Iohnson,</HI> being the Translator hereof, followed his Fathers steps; They both of them loved Sack, and harmlesse Mirth, and here they shew it; and I (that know my self) am not a|verse from it neither.

<HEAD>The Argument or Subject of the Comedy.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CHremylus</HI> an honest decaied Gentleman, willing to become rich, repaireth to the Oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> to enquire how he might compasse his designe: The Oracle en|joyneth him to follow that man whom he first met with, and never part from his company. The man he met is the old blind <HI>God of Wealth</HI> disguised. After this, <HI>Chremylus</HI> calleth his poor (but honest) Neighbours to partake of his happinesse. The honest party rejoyce at the news; Rascals only and vitious persons are discontented. <HI>Plutus</HI> is led to the Temple of <HI>Esculapius,</HI> by whose art and help he recovereth his eye-sight. At this Knaves are even mad, they m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rmure and complain exceedingly. Likewise the Goddesse <HI>Poverty,</HI> that aforetime had great power in the Land, complaineth that her scepter is al|most broken to peeces: thereupon she raiseth wars, but is rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed; she also is vanquished in disputation of the necessity of Poverty. Knaves again salute <HI>Weeping-crosse,</HI> as well as <HI>Pennylesse-bench.</HI> Nay, the <HI>Pope</HI> himself is even starved. Lastly, to vexe them more, the <HI>God of Wealth</HI> is introduced married to <HI>Honesty.</HI></P>

Our condition is miser|able; for if our Masters but dine at the Ordi|nary of mischief, the poore Serving-man is sure to be fed with the scraps of misfortune: We must share of our Masters misery, we are but Tenants, they will not let us be Free|holders to the petty Lordships of our own corpusculous Fortune; damnable Fortune! how fatally hast thou sold the tenure of us, to him that will pay us our wages! 'Tis very true that I tell you: And now see the per|verse effects of all. O how I could cuff <HI>Apol|lo!</HI> I have a quarrel to <HI>Apollo,</HI> that wryleg'd, ridling, fidling god, that snorts out Oracles from his guilded brundlet. They say, this same Gaffer <HI>Phoebus</HI> is a good Mountebanck, and an excellent Musitian; but a deuse on him, it does not seem so, he has sent my Ma|ster home so sick of Melancholy, that I da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e swear, this scurvy <HI>Tom Piper</HI> of <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lphos</HI> did not play him so much as one fit of mirth, not a lig or Sellengers-round. And now see how he follows a blind Puppy i' th' taile, contrary to Law or Reason: For we that have our eys should lead, not follow the blind. The very Dog in the Chronicles, that had his eyes, stood upon his royal Prerogative, of going before the blinde Beggar of <HI>Bednal-green.</HI> Nor can he be content to doe it himself, but he must make me too guilty of the same ig|norance. If I but ask him a question, he hath not so much manners as my Granam's Sow; I cannot get him to grunt me an an|swer: yet I cannot choose but speak, though my hedge of Teeth were a Quick-set, my tongue would through. You sir, that say you are my Master, if you doe not tell me why we follow this blundring guide, be sure, I will never leave vexing and tormenting you: you shall tell me, that you shall.</P>

Nay, 'tis the humour of this age, they think they shall never be great men, unlesse they have grosse bodies. Marry I keep men spare and lean, slender and nimble; mine are all Diminutives, <HI>Tom Thumbs,</HI> not one <HI>Colossus,</HI> not one <HI>Garagan|tua</HI> amongst them; fitter to encounter the enemy by reason of their agility, in l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e dan|ger of shot for their tenuity, and most expert in running away, such is their celerity. <HI>Ergo, Irus</HI> is a good souldier, and <HI>Midas</HI> is an asse.</P>

<P>Nay tis no wonder if they be slender enough, you keep them with such spare diet: they have so much Lent and Fasting-dayes, that they need not fear the danger of being as fat as Committee-men.

<P>Just as I am of <HI>Chremylus.</HI> Sirra, seeing you are of good parts and properties, you may presume to come sometimes into my bed-chamber.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes there were many Country-lobs, that having surfeited on the glory-bacon of their Milk-maids favours, were fain to repair to the next Alehouse for purgations. Deaf Scriveners came for their cares; Silenc'd Ministers to be cured of dumbnesse; many Scholers of Colledges, whose gowns having been sick divers years of the scu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">f, desired the god to do them the grace as to change the colour of that disease into the black-jaundies.</P>

<P>And did he cure them all?</P>

<P>All but <HI>Neoclides;</HI> a blind fellow, and yet such an arrant thief, that he sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e all things he set his eyes on. To proceed: the Monk put out the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">allow-tapers, bid us sleep, and whatsoever hissing we heard, to see and say nothing. There we slept soundly, and in the honour of <HI>Esculapius</HI> snorted most de|voutly. Marry J could not sleep: for there was an old woman with a pitcher of pease|porredge
<PB N="26" REF="17">
at her head lay next to me. Now I had a great zeal to devoure the delicious pil|low: but putting forth my hand, I espi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d the bald Friar eating the religious cakes, and cracking of the consecrated nuts. So I think|ing it a peece of divine charity, studied how to cheat the old Beldame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs.</SPEAKER>
<P>O sacrilegious Varlet! wert not a|fraid of the god?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, lest he might cosen me of my pease-porredge. The woman perceiving me put forth her hand: then I fell a hissing like a <HI>Winchester-goose</HI> on <HI>S.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aud did not the god come yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>O mistresse, now comes the jest: when the god came neer me, my devotions <HI>a posteriori</HI> sent him forth most ridiculous orisons; the Pease-broth in me was so windy that I thought I had an <HI>Aeolus</HI> in my belly; my guts wambled, and on the sudden evapo|rated a clap or two of most unmanerly thun|der, the very noise of it broke all the Urinals in the Spittle-house, and saved <HI>Esculapius</HI> the labour of casting <HI>Iupiters</HI> water; it fright|ed his poor Apothecary out of his wits, as he was making <HI>Saturn</HI> a glister <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> and for the smell, <HI>Penacea&punc;</HI> told her father that she was sure it could not be frankincense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but was not the god angry that you kept your backside no closer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who he! 'Tis such a nasty <HI>Numen,</HI> he would be glad if your close-stool were his alms-tub, that he might feed upon your meat at second hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but leave your windy discourse, and proceed with your tale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>At length two snakes appeared, and lickt <HI>Plutus</HI> eyes: then <HI>Aesculapius</HI> beating <HI>Aigus</HI> his head in a mortar, tempered it with a look beyond <HI>Luther,</HI> well minced with the rosted apple of his eye: the whole confection boil'd in a pint of christalline humour, which being dropt into his eye with the feather of a peacocks tail, he recovered his sight in the twinkling of an eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came the god of wealth blind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How! Because Honesty is like a Puck-fist; he never met it but once, and it put out his eyes: besides, the rich Rogue had too many Pearls in his eyes.</P>

<P>And what are we the better now his eye-sight is restored?</P>

<P>To be rich is the daintiest pleasure in the world; especially, to grow rich without ventring the danger of <HI>Tiburn</HI> or Whipping. Every Cupbord is full of Custards, the Hogs|heads replenished with sparkling Sacks. The veriest <HI>Gippo</HI> in the house will not drink a degree under Muscadine. All the Porredge|pots are arrant <HI>Barbary</HI> gold. All the Vessels in the house, from the Bason and Ewer to the Chamber-pot and Vinegar-bottle, are of <HI>Middletons</HI> silver. The Kitchen and Buttery is entire Ivory, the very purity of the Ele|phants tooth. The Sinke is paved with the rich Rubies, and incomparable Carbuncles of Sir <HI>Iohn Oldcastle</HI>'s Nose. The Conduit runs as good Rose-water as any is in <HI>Ari|stotles</HI> Well. The Dish-clouts are cloath of Tissue, and from the skirts of every Scullion drop melting streames of Amber grease. We the poor servants play at Even and Odd with arch-angels, and at Crosse and Pile for Ja|cobusses, in a humour, to out <HI>Philip</HI> the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> My Master is sacrificing a Sow, a Goat, and a Ram for joy; But J could not endure the house, there is such a smoak from the reaking of the roast, that though it please my stomack, my eyes are offended with it.</P>

<P>Hey ho! methinks <HI>I</HI> am sick with lying alone last night. Well, I will scratch out the eyes of this same rascally <HI>Plutus</HI> god of wealth, that has undone me. Alas poor woman! since the shop of <HI>Plutus</HI> his eyes has been open, what abundance of misery has befallen thee! Now the young Gallant will no longer kisse thee nor imbrace thee: but thou poor widow must lie comfortlesse in a solitary pair of sheets, having nothing to cover thee but the lecherous Rug and the bawdy Blankets. O that J were young again! how it comforts me to remember the death of my maidenhead! Alas poor woman, they contemn old age, as if our lechery was out of date. They say we are cold: methinks that thought should make um take compassion of us, and lie with us, if not for love, for charity. They say we are dry: so much the more ca|pable of <HI>Cupids</HI> fire; while young wenches, like green wood, smoke before they flame. They say we are old: why then experience makes us more expert. They tell us our lips are wrinkled: why that in kissing makes the sweeter titillation. They sweare we have no teeth: why then they need not fear biting. VVell, if our lease of Lechery be out, yet me|thinks we might purchase a Night-labourer for his dayes-wages. I will be reveng'd of this same <HI>Plutus,</HI> that wrongs the orphans, and is so uncharitable to the widows. Ho, ho, who's within here!</P>

<P>I but now, the unconstant Wag has not the same measure of respect; I sent him a Custard yesterday, and he would not accept of it, because it quaked like my worm-eaten&mdash;. I sent him other sweetmeats too, but he return'd me answer, that certainly J had breath'd on them, for they smelt of my Gums. Moreover, he bid me despaire of a night|labourer, and never more expect him at mid|night again. For <HI>Plutus</HI> has made him rich without me; adding withall, That once J was young: <HI>Ostend</HI> was once a pretty town. The <HI>Milesians</HI> in the dayes of yore were valiant: and in the dayes of King <HI>Henry</HI> the English were sturdy fellows at the battell of <HI>Agin-Court.</HI></P>

<P>Faith, J commend the stripling for his wit. Tis none of the worst conditions.

<P>Therefore, my friend, <HI>Plutus</HI> is to blame to promise relief, when he does us such intolerable damages. How do you think J can endure to lie alone, when so many sprights are walking?
