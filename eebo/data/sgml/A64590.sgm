<L>YOur Son's true worth whom we Lament as Dead</L>
<L>Has drawn these Verses from my Heart, not Head;</L>
<L>They are a plain true Narrative of what</L>
<L>All men allow, no feigning what was not;</L>
<L>I never thought you pleas'd with flattering Fictions,</L>
<L>Nor that such stuff was proper in Afflictions:</L>
<L>I seldom Rhime, though there be seasons when</L>
<L>The grav'st and holyest have so us'd their Pen,</L>

<L>THE best siz'd Pillar of the fairest Pile;</L>
<L>That has of late been built on <HI>Ireland</HI>'s Isle</L>
<L>Is fall'n; some were to short, others too long</L>
<L>Some are too old, and others much too young.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>His numerous Name being like a Town too wide</L>
<L>To be well mann'd, or fully fortifi'd:</L>
<L>He was their Cittadel within, their Mote</L>
<L>Without, their force which on the Sea did flote;</L>
<L>At Land their Army, nothing being more</L>
<L>Ready to fight upon the Sea or Shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">

<L>He didn't grasp Commands to scrape up Gold&punc;</L>
<L>When he was Chief, all Offices were sold</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="2">'Tis true; for what d' you thing? for Skill in Arms,</L>
<L>For Vigilance and Courage, those only Charms</L>
<L>Wrought on his Soul; He that could pay good store</L>
<L>Of Sterling-merit, needed pay no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Who knew him well, could not believe that ever</L>
<L>He meant to Dy thus tamely of a FEAVER;</L>
<L>The Fates did disappoint him; it was their Check</L>
<L>He had not dy'd upon a Blood-smear'd Deck,</L>
<L>Or Storming, fell down from a scalding Ladder,</L>
<L>First by Granadoes rent, or what is sadder.</L>
<L>Some Royal Ship his Coffin should have been.</L>
<L>Stranded in Fight where tall Rocks might be seen</L>
<L>To shew the Sea-faring Crew; where OSSORY</L>
<L>Fought for the Laws, and for the KING did Dy.</L>

<LG N="5">

<L>What must we Weep? No, let no Muses whine,</L>
<L>Nor Verse be wet with Metaphorick Brine;</L>
<L>His Name's not Dead, who stands inshrin'd with Glory,</L>
<L>Embalm'd by Fame, with Monuments and Story:</L>
<L>Cannons go weep out Flames, Culverins go cry</L>
<L>And roar, from every Ship and Battery,</L>
<L>That <HI>OSSORY</HI>'s gone! gone, whither? to scare <HI>Iove</HI>'s Thunder,</L>
<L>And try what Powers can make him Fear or Wonder.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Should his Friends mourn? when this is his Condition.</L>
<L>Or rather piously envy's fruition?</L>
<L>No, mourn poor Suitors! who want his helpful word,</L>
<L>Mourn more ye KING's that did deserve his Sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Rather than weep fret, that the KING, the Nation</L>
<L><HI>Ireland,</HI> his House, and th' whole Confederation</L>
<L>Of worthy Men, his Children and his Wife</L>
<L>Were all trappann'd and couzen'd of his Life:</L>
<L>For He (who Fire and Ball was proof) with Ice</L>
<L>Was Burnt, and with a <HI>Peach,</HI> shot in a trice.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>VVhat did you mean, you blind Fantastick Fates,</L>
<L>Thus to exert your envy, peeks and hates?</L>
<L>VVere ye asleep at <HI>Mons,</HI> why didn't ye there</L>
<L>Kill him, or try if you could make him Fear?</L>
<L>Or tear him with the <HI>Belgick</HI> Lion's Claws?</L>
<L>Or with Death's treble Tooth (Fire, Sword, Sea) Jaws.</L>

<L>Why Sister Furies! you had been less cruel</L>
<L>T'have let him fall in some punctillious Duel,</L>

<L>Of Honour, and before the World did see</L>
<L>And read the Volumns&punc; which his Sword had writ,</L>
<L>Without the help of fourb or fripon wit.</L>
<L>Y'have done your worst, Him whom you could not beat</L>
<L>Yee treacherously have poyson'd by a Cheat.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>More <HI>Iameses</HI> will miss him, than one or two,</L>
<L>When they have great and dangerous work to do:</L>
<L>Since he has fought enough; Let the next Prize</L>
<L>Be play'd by others; thus th'Heavens just and wise</L>
<L>(That he might but look on and not engage)</L>

<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>Now Tack about (poor Muse) 'Tis time to turn,</L>
<L>We do but rant, to say we will not mourn:</L>
<L>Tis true, some giddy Sceptics may rejoyce,</L>
<L>But so to do is not in good mens choice;</L>
<L>There will be Mourners, though the most sincere</L>
<L>May neither Musselins, Creap, nor long black wear.</L>

<L>Red in the Lidds, and underneath them Blue,</L>
<L>Sallow and pale will be the Nations Hew:</L>
<L>Men of brisk stomack will their food refuse,</L>
<L>And not a few immoderate Wine dis-use.</L>
<L>Now sleepless Heads will tell the Clocks all Night,</L>
<L>And slumbring often startle in a fright;</L>
<L>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">t broken Dreams and Fancies will possess</L>
<L>Concerned minds? what Vapours will oppress</L>
<L>The <HI>Hypocondries</HI> of distemper'd Spleen?</L>
<L>More than before for many years was seen.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>How many wronged wretches, poor and blind,</L>
<L>Will grope in vain their Remedies to find?</L>
<L>What will the Lame-maim'd Sea-men do? whose Chest</L>
<L>Was Patron <HI>OSSORY</HI>'s most munificent Brest.</L>
<L>The sound instead of songs of Drink and Lass</L>
<L>Will sing his Name at Helm (each his watch Glass)</L>
<L>And on the Deck, fancy the starry Trayn</L>
<L>They see, is <HI>OSSORY,</HI> up in <HI>Charls</HI> his Wayn;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">But singing sigh, That <HI>OSSORY</HI> no more</L>
<L>Shall mak'm fight at Sea, nor Drink a shore:</L>
<L>What Lamentations will this Blow so sharp?</L>

<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>All Hands to Work, let every faculty</L>
<L>Come help to soften this Calamity.</L>
<L>Come you Divines! more than deserve the fair</L>
<L>Preferments you have had, beat not the Air</L>
<L>In Pulpits, but let your Inspired Arts</L>
<L>Preach Balsoms to the bruised <HI>Ormond</HI>-Hearts,</L>
<L>Enlarge on <HI>Iob,</HI> and branch on every Head.</L>
<L>That <HI>David</HI> spake when <HI>Ba'shba</HI>'s Son was Dead.</L>

<L>VVhere are the Opticks I have often had!</L>
<L>That could reduce a shape, tho ne'r so bad</L>
<L>Deform'd and ugly, to a handsome hew?</L>
<L>Help now to make things hideous and true;</L>
<L>Look fair though false, make <HI>Ormond</HI>'s House believe</L>
<L>They may their <HI>OSSORY</HI> and their Son retrieve.</L>
<L>Give of those Optick Instruments, to each</L>
<L>Of his Name one, to valiant Souldiers reach</L>
<L>One a piece more, and then (for fear of failure)</L>
<L>Give two a piece to every fighting Sailer;</L>
<L>Thus by Refractions, and contriv'd reflections</L>
<L>Delude his Friend and temper their Affections.</L>

<L>Palliate this Sore, some <HI>Aesculapian</HI> Hand!</L>
<L>Till dozeing time can <HI>Cicatrize</HI> it, and</L>
<L>Beget new Hopes, until new measures be taken,</L>
<L>And old designs off from your minds he shaken.</L>

<L>Now, tell me (Heav'ns Favourite) when shall I</L>
<L>Leave off to mourn? when? not till thou dy:</L>
<L>You are in Paradice, we know right well</L>
<L>You have already conquer'd Death and Hell;</L>
<L>Send me a Pasport from the place of Bliss,</L>
<L>And let me your exalted feet go kiss.</L>
<L>So shall your shining Face all my Tears dry,</L>
<L>Like Summer-sun, O let me go, I'le dy.</L>
