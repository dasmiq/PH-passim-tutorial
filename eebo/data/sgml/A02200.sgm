<P><HI>_HAuing this lying by me, vvithout any purpose to publish it as yet, I vvas aduertized of the taking a|vvay of M.</HI> Penries <HI>book by the Pursiuant. VVhereupon I resol|ued (though it should be some of|fence to my friende) not to closet it vp any longer, lest th'aduersary shoulde too much triumph &amp; in|sult. Euen as it came vnto my hands, so haue I gi|uen it his pasport, vvithout any addition or alte|ration of mine: onely the Title I confesse is mine ovvne, the rest is my Oxford friends, vvho if he be thought in his pleasant veine anye thing too snap|pish, the reader is to vvey vvith vvhat kind of ad uersary he deales: namely, vvith the snappishest gentleman, and most bitter mouthes, that euer put pen to paper. For the rest, it may be I am partial, and therefore I leaue the iudgement to others. The man (it should seeme) had no purpose to stand vpo~ euery particuler, but rather in a kinde of cursorie deliuery to his friend, but to touch (as it vvere) the general defects &amp; lamenes of M.</HI> Somes <HI>distem|pered discourse: vvhich yet the reader shall see he hath not done it so slightly neither, but that the na|kednesse and pouertie of most of the aduersaries groundes, may easilie be discried by this, if there vvere no more. Neuertheles, for the better satisfi|ing

of all men, I hope he that hath hitherto vnder|taken the cause vvith so happie a hand, vvill not so leaue it if God assist him. I hope I say, not vvith standing the violent &amp; iniurious vvresting of his labours out of his hands, the Lord in his good time vvill bring them forth to the fuller clearing &amp; de|cyding of the vvhole at large. In the mean vvhile M.</HI> Some <HI>may do vvell, hauing gotten his aduer|saries booke (as it is like he hath, if his pen be not stroken vvith a desperate feare) to publishe it vn|mangled as he receiued it, and so to confute it if he can. His aduersarie being so vveake as he takes him to be, he need not to svveate much about it, it vvill be done he knovves, vvith the turning of a hand. And vvhile he is in trauel about such a mi|racle, there be of his friendes, that vvill be so bolde to pray for him for good-vvill, that God vvoulde vouchsafe him an humble spirite in a thorovve feeling of his ovvne vvants, that hovvsoeuer he be puffed vp othervvise, he may tremble and stoope at the scepter of Iuda, and be|vvare he spurne not against the trueth.</HI></P>

<P>_BEe it so, sithence you will needs haue it so, prouided that you be not ouerhastie to communicate it, for that may breed danger to me, and no great good to your selfe. If it be the same M. <HI>Some,</HI> that read somtime a Lecture in my L. of Leicesters house, then is he quite new founded since I saw him, and his spirit it should seeme, strangely vapored vpward into some loftier climate the~ was vsual with him in those daies, you can remember I am sure, when he was taken for an other manner of man of a soft constitution, and a simple harted man, as most of his coate within the land. Albeit that euen then when he gaue this glamse of sinceritie and mildnes, there were some you knowe that stood in contention with vs about him, in that he made no bones (as they then saide) to be adaylie nonresident from his charge, and withal closely and slily to glut downe a pretty prebend or 2. to help his disgestion, which as you and I were then hardly draw|en to beleeue, thinking all this to be but injuriously fathered vppon him, so yet if that should be true as the knight giueth out, that my L. of Leycester shold vse any such speeches of him, <HI>That he feared be would prooue but an ambitious foole when al was don.</HI> Remem|bring what hath fallen out since, I promise you it was shrewdly aymed of my Lord, and we must needs yeld he had a notable eie, that could in so smoth a counte|nance, and so close a carriage of a man, spie out neuer|thelesse the cloude of ambition afar of: it was not for nought it should seem, that he was so long emplojed by her maiestie in affaires of State.</P>
<P>But it is no reason you would say, that euery thing should be measured after the partiall and passionate
<PB N="2" REF="4">
judgment of men howe greate soeuer they be: very true, and therefore to cleare the suspition, and to wipe away al that might seeme through prejudice in any sort to bleamish the man, let your D. hardly speake for himselfe, for <HI>index animi sermo,</HI> or as he him selfe saith, <HI>ex vnguibus leonem,</HI> of th'abundance of the hart the mouth speaketh, and these (if I be not deceiued,) you shal finde to be his owne words, which som think had bin fitter forfytie works against the landing of the Spanyards, then for grounded reasons and argu|me~ts to decide a controuersie by. But I wil not brand them with any cole of mine, let them weigh as they wil in the judgment of the wise, I will neither peize downe the ballance at th'one end, nor lighten it at th'other: only because you presse me to tel you what I thinke, I will first take some paines to drawe you a callender of his owne speeches as I finde them scat|tered in his book, and so leaue the judgment to your selfe: nay as master Doct. telleth the ignorant welch|man, I wil not in this case refuse the judgment of his owne disciples, if they haue any dram of equitie in them, so that they remember to follow their masters rule, and bring with them <HI>iudicium non preiudicium,</HI> harken then I pray you a while, to the sound of this learned trumpet, and tel me your opinion when wee meete.</P>
<P>First in the very title of his booke, he beginneth thus. If the bare outside be so glittered, what may we thinke of the pearles within? <HI>A refutation of many a|nabaptisticall, blasphemous, and popish absurdities tou|ching Magistracie, Ministery, Church, Scripture, and Baptisme:</HI> And then he goeth on very sweetly thus.</P>
<P><HI>M. Penri</HI> (saith he) <HI>is very ignoraunt, and his treatise very sillie &amp; corrupt stuffe: His booke is a fardle of grose errors: none account of it but such as are of the fantasti|call

crue, men extremely both proud and ignorant: his in|constancie proceedes of a vaine humor, which as a whirl|winde doth strangely carye and ouercarie him: his grosse errors: his absurd, anabaptisticall and blasphemous fan|sies. I dare be bold to say, that is the spiders webb be good cloath, and the cockatrice eggs holsome meate, then such points as I resute in this treatise, are very excelent diui|nitie. His speach is very grosse: his reasons are most ab|surd and childish. This is intollerable sawcines:</HI> Inscitia audax: <HI>None so bold as blind bayard. This is a grosse and popish error, a popish collection, a most absurde heresie: your arreast is like Goliabs curse.</HI> M. PENRI <HI>hath trou|bled heuen, church, commonwelth &amp; himself. Heauen, for he is sawcie with God himselfe: Churche, for in steade of treasure, he hath offered it very dangerous poyson. Com|mon wealth, for he hath vndermined the chaire of the Magistrate, I hope such conies will be looked vnto. Him|selfe, for he hath broached many proud, blasphemous, and anabaptisticall fansies. The marke that</HI> M. PENRI <HI>le|uels at, is I feare me, to shake handes with the anabapti|sticall recusants, some part of his writings looke shrewdly that way. I make very mean account as yet of your judg|ment: you haue broached grosse errors: thanke yourself for sowing such giddie fansies: you are too imperiall. If my reasons were sutable to your answers, they were verie wofull: your tongue cannot disgrace me, your tongue is no sclander.</HI> Sus Mineruam: <HI>your dealing with me, is neither honest nor schoolelike: if you see not this, you are starke blind. The wrangling spirits are the more for your absurd writings: They which are so forward in iangling of these points, are either of your humor, which is very bad, or A|nabaptisticall recusants which is somewhat worse.</HI></P>
<P>Will you any more of this? It is you see but a myrie tracke that I tread in, and yet the farther one wades, the more quicke sandes and quauemires he is like to
<PB N="4" REF="5">
finde: for thus your doctor goeth on.</P>
<P><HI>I am sorie for your heauinesse: I detest your anabap|tisticall fancies: your gift in answering is very rare: you make wash way of the weightiest arguments: you bewray intollerable both pride and ignorance: you are one of the strangest diuines that euer I heard of, very ignorant, ve|ry bold, very absurd: your iudgment is not worth a rush: your dealing with me is most absurd: you haue grossely a|bused me: you are neere driuen when you vse such begger|ly shifts to bumbaste your treatise: Honest matrons vse no paintings, but harlots doe: grosse errors haue neede of suche vermiliom: the vaile of mallice did hinder your sight: This odious instance doth best become your spirit: It is sutable to the rest of your writings, most absurde and childish: your absurdities are many and grosse: if you re|cant not your anabaptisticall errors, I will account very basely of you. The name of Maiestie is to costly a garment for so lepprous a bodie as your treatise is: It is the maner of all sectaries to vse lofly &amp; maiestical words, that their ignorant followers may commend them aboue the skies. My answere is, that you are a wicked slanderer: such dea|ling is an argument of a vile nature, and a wrangling spi|ryt: if I were of your humor, I could chase and pursue you hotely for your inconstancie and error. In your treatise you haue sowne grosse errors thicke &amp; threfold. Are not your disciples most vnhappy that depend one you as one an other Pope? This bewraieth your grosse ignorance: if my reasons were as weake as your sensles answers, they were strange stuffe: what meane Scholler, what russet coat in the country would shape such an answere? your wittes I thinke were a woolgathering: this answeere I thinke came out of Barbarie, I hope you are ashamed of it by this time: did euer any student deale so childishly? I see by his answeres what a deepe clark he is, your weightie obiections haue neither</HI> succum <HI>nor</HI> sanguine~: <HI>they haue
<PB N="5" REF="5">
no pith in them, they are lighter then any feather, and be|wray your ignorance: your lusty speches cannot daunt me: it is but a visor. I haue bin long acquainted with the boi|sterous speches of such ignorant and bold companions as you are.</HI> salis pro imperio, <HI>you are by your leaue a litle to Lordly: had I nothing to thinke of but your absurd fan|sies: you imagin very basely of me: I doe but touch this grosse and blasphemous paradox of yours: what base ware you commend vnto vs for excellent diuinitie?</HI></P>
<P>Howe think you? Wil you any more yet? Or are you not halfe weary of reading? Well I hope nowe if my hands doe happen to smell any thing vnsauorly, you wil of curtesie beare with me, because you see I haue bin al this while gathering of weedes. But alasse is this all thinke you? No assure your selfe, there is yet a vile deale of such behinde, for these (I take it) are of the same forge:</P>
<P><HI>He that would saile after your compasse for diuinitie matters, should proue as giddy as a goose (saith your doc|tor:) you haue euil lucke: you are an vnpleasant musition: you haue kept strange coiles: you lay on load, but it is</HI> ful|men non tonitru, <HI>black cloudes but no raine: I praye God to keepe the people of the land, from such blinde guides as the ignorant sorte are, &amp; from such shamelesse &amp; phantastical guides as you master Penry are: if you will deale plainly neuer piddle any longer, goe through stitch with al. Seing you are ouer shooes, aduenture ouer bootes to confute Caluin, giue th'onset, if you faile, you shall loose no credit of learning, for you neuer had any as yet.</HI> Qui semel vericundiae limites, &amp;c. <HI>you knowe the rest &amp;c. M. Peurye is in his ruffe. His pride and igno|rance appeare in their coulers: if you be not void of grace be sory and ashamed of your blasphemous lewdnes: you haue vsed th' Apostle as Cacus did Hercules oxen. Did a|ny student euer broth such sluffe as this? Many Carrmen
<PB N="6" REF="6">
in London can make better arguments: your writing haue nether grace nor salt: your absurd collections are euiden|ces of your spirit: vnskilful preachers are your bulwarks and blockhouses to support your fancies: you haue shotte but many scores wide: you are one of the strangest turners that euer I knewe: you haue turned out such a deale of grosse diuiuitie vppon me and others, that we are weary &amp; you may be ashamed of it: you would neuer I thinke haue vented such motley stuffe as this, if you had thought it would haue bene looked on. Manye learned condemne your treatise for a foolish and santastical bable: you are so sawey with the principal of the religion, in this noble land. I make more accoumpt I tel you of one Caluin then of a thousand Penries: you haue a special guist in varying a phrase, for that you shal bear the bell and the claper to: it is a blinde and beggerly shist: your arguments are</HI> Sco|pae dissolutae, <HI>very loose ware &amp; slenderly trussed toge|ther:</HI> more he tels <HI>master Penry,</HI> that there is no rea|son he should haue such libertie of printing as he, for saith he, <HI>you broach and Print grosse errors &amp; anabap|tisticall fansies: so doe not I: you refused to offer &amp; sub|mit your writings, to the view &amp; alowance of the Magi|strate: so doe not I: you woulde haue me procure your ju|dicial hearing, &amp;c. your request is not equal.</HI> Nec te noui nec vbi sis. <HI>Speake for your selfe in Gods name: so will I. If you will reuoke your error &amp; heresies, otherwise I will not open my lippes for any such as you are.</HI> Likewise in the same place, Master Penty hauing shewed that he did reuerence him for his guifes, is thus cut short, and vncurteously rewarded for his paines. <HI>Be sory saith he for your selfe. Detest your fansies, your reuerence I make verie mean account of: Gods truth is as deare to me as to you. I hope it hath had &amp; shall haue more defence by me then by you, there is som reson it should.</HI> And afterwards he co~meth vppon him thus: <HI>you are not</HI> (saith he) <HI>Ma|ster
<PB N="7" REF="6">
of the sentences as Peter Lambarde was: if you were, the sound diuinitie that is taught in Cambridge &amp; Ox|forde should be cried downe: and your strange fansies should be ruled cases. The refutation of your blasphemus, Anabaptistical, popish, &amp; proud errors by me, is I am sure a performance of a special duty to almighty God, my Prince, and this Church. Greate words shall not fraie me: if your ignorant disciples wil stil magnifie you, it shal not be strange to me, they doe but their kinde: you vse goodly words sometimes, but your proude malice wil appeare, it cannot be hidden: your heretical absurdities in your trea|tise, &amp; your shamelesse dealing with our Magistrates doe crie aloud, &amp;c. I praie God with all my hart, to keepe me &amp; all such as loue religion from such as you and the fan|tastical sort are: you are strange cattell: you hope that I will graunt you the cause, a vain hope, for I think scorne to be one of ignorant Penries disciples, that is a proude and ignorant Anababtist. If you will haue anie thing at my hands you must get it by force of argument. If you thinke I wil come of otherwise, you are in a wrong box, for I entend not to be at your whystle: yea I require and charge you in the name of God, (if you be not voide of grace) that you consesse your ignorance and detest your errors, &amp;c. Thus haue you my resolution, and yet you are no conqueror as Coesar was, nor I ouerthrowne as Pompei was: if your arguments were as tidie, as your speeches are consident, there were no dealing with you: I perceiue the greatest barkers are not the forest byters: Blinde</HI> Barti|meus <HI>could haue espied this: you may command and con|trolle, and deale with others as</HI> Strato <HI>did, that was king ouer beasts, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>How now if a man may aske you, are you not neere cloyed by this? What thinke you nowe of my L. of Leycester his prophesie? Was not the figure well sett that hit so right of the mans constitution? Yet is this
<PB N="8" REF="7">
the man you see, that can for all this tel his aduersary and that ful solemly, that the best conqueast he can haue is, to ouercome his pride by humility, yea and more, tel him plainly that he liketh better <HI>Humile pec|catum, quam superbam innocentiam:</HI> he that wil so of|ten and so peremptorily lay haughtines and pride to an other man, had he not neede thinke you to be a litle clearer from that infection himselfe, then your doctor sheweth him selfe to be? But it may be he will mend the matter in some other places of his booke, and it is odds he wil not alwaies be in this key: like e|nough, and therefore let him speake once againe for himselfe. About his. 77. page as I take it, where M. <HI>Penri</HI> doth seeme to say, that we can hardly haue any sealed assurance in our harts, that we receaue any sa|crament at the dumbe ministers hands, because wee haue no such promise of the Lord, and our assurance must alwaies be grounded vpon the promises of God, marke I pray you howe M. Some refuteth this:</P>
<P><HI>You are at warre</HI> (saith he) <HI>with your selfe: you wordes agree like harpe and harrow: your disciples are sit vessels to receiue anie liquor of you, but men of learning and wis|dome are otherwise affected: your dealing is absurde and dangerous, absurd for it is void of truth, dangerous for it would breed confusion. The Magistrates thanks be to god, neither do nor will suffer this bad course of yours: if they should, sancies would as weedes grow too fast, and this no|ble land should receiue more hurt the~ your head is worth: I doubt not of their godlie wisedome: The miserable e|state of Germanie heretofore by reason of sectaries, may and will awaken them: If you be restrained from your grosse errors, as some are verie iustlye, you must not crie, persecution persecution, your note must be,</HI> Poena persi|diae, <HI>that is, that you are iustly met with, otherwise you sing out of tune.</HI> And not long after this, he payeth him
<PB N="9" REF="7">
againe with a syllogisme or two in the same figure. <HI>I am perswaded, that if you be not well conjured by the ma|gistrate, you will prooue a strange bodie: you are far gone alreadie, strange fansies haue almost consumed you: The Magistrates discipline is the fittest medicine for you: if that will not recouer you, your disease is desperate.</HI> Yea &amp; now he hath said it, he will stand to it, he meanes not you shall see him blush at the matter: For page 155. he addeth: <HI>If either</HI> M. Penrie, <HI>or anie of his santasti|call crue, shall thinke much of my speach, I do not passe: I confesse freelie, that sharpe words are not sufficient plai|sters for such proud sores: I hope the magistrate will con|sider further of him and such as he is.</HI> Duro nodo, durus cuneus, &amp;c. <HI>that is, a wedge of iron is fittest for knottie wood.</HI> Besides al this, he is vp with <HI>blasphemous</HI> against him, I thinke aboue a dozen times, and in that good Christian moode of his, it pleaseth him full sweetly, to call M. <HI>Penri, an hereticall Catabaptist:</HI> and of his charitie, to liken and compare him to <HI>Demetrius</HI> the siluer Smith: to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Copper smith: to the wicked women in the 13. of <HI>Ezekiel:</HI> to the gracelesse people in the time of <HI>Esai, Ieremie</HI> and <HI>Micheas:</HI> To wicked <HI>Amaziah</HI> in <HI>Ieroboams</HI> court: To <HI>Athalia</HI> that wicked trayteresse: To harlots that paint themselues: To <HI>Neuius</HI> the clamorous companion: To <HI>Thrasilaus</HI> the frantike man: To the monstrous sonne, that cud|gelled his father: To <HI>Nestorias</HI> the heretik: To <HI>Pho|tinus</HI> a grosse heretike: To <HI>Aetius</HI> a pestilent heretik: To the <HI>Donatists,</HI> the <HI>Papists,</HI> the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> and the <HI>Anabaptists:</HI> To <HI>Campion:</HI> To <HI>Goliab:</HI> To <HI>Simon Ma|gus:</HI> To <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apostata: To murdering <HI>Ioab:</HI> To that bloody beast <HI>Ismael,</HI> that shedd teares, but they were Crocodiles teares: and last of all, to make vp the mouth of all, to that honest man <HI>Iudas</HI> that betrayed Christ. And like inough, if he could haue founde out

<P>Of al which, what other confutation should a wise man make the~ <HI>vah quam sordide: quis suror que rabia?</HI> Sure if your doctor had conceiled his name, and sett only these 3. letters R. S.

For to goe no farther, shewe me if you can, a Cambridge man that is a match to <HI>M. Reynolds,</HI> I meane not in learning but in mildenesse: or shewe me an Oxforde man that is a match to <HI>M.

<HI>Harte,</HI> that wretched Iesuite, may therein be as a pat|terne and glasse to your whole vniuersitie while the world standeth. I doubt not but you haue reade it, and then you cannot but knowe, against what kinde of person he dealeth in that conference, namely against one alredy atteinted and conuicted of treason, in him against al such as were sworne en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">mies to our religi|on and state, such as had long thirsted for the destruc|tion of her maiestie, and th'ouerthrowe of God his church, and viler men you knowe, there could not lightly be vnder the sunne. If any people in the world shoulde mooue a man to glaunce out into passion, or his pen to impacience, it were like enough to these. And yet I beleeue (prie as narrowly as you can,) you shal hardly pike out any one bitter, evenimed or dis|piteful sentence brought in of purpose, only to wound and disgrace his aduetsarie in the whole booke. See then the difference of spirits: your doctor dealeth not with any such manner of man I trowe: for <HI>M. Penri,</HI> howe vnlearned soeuer he be, (as <HI>M. Some</HI> maketh him worse then a drudge and a turnespit in al maner of knowledg) or howsoeuer he may vary from others in judgment, is thought yet of those that knowe him to be very honest and godly of life, and I haue heard that he is one that vsually haunteth the holy excersi|ses of religion, walking in al peaceable obedience to God and her maiestie, and that he hath bin a meanes to reclaime and cal back some that for want of a prea|ching minnistery, were euen at the brinke to decline to <HI>Brownisme:</HI> this I haue heard, howsoeuer it be, if you haue reade his writings, I appeale to your owne hart, whether you thinke him the childe of God or no, being in the judgment of some, a thing vnpossible that any man should write as he writeth, vnlesse hee were endewed with some good measure of Gods spi|rit,
<PB N="12" REF="9">
if it be so, then that he be the childe of God, and that he be wide in this point, (as for mine owne parte I wil not trust him that neuer held error,) how happy had it bene for him, if he had had M. <HI>Reinolds</HI> his ad|uersarie in liew of M, <HI>Some,</HI> of whome he might hap|pen haue learned more and bene disgraced lesse. For he that dealeth so mildely with an ennemie, howe christianly thinke you would he haue intreated a bro|ther: whie alasse, the question being, <HI>Whether we may be assured to receiue a sacrament at the dumbe ministers hands,</HI> is it not possible for a christian in humblenesse to handle this question, vnlesse he runne to Vulcan the blacksmith for weapons, or bring <HI>Hercules furens</HI> vpon the stage, as M. <HI>Some</HI> doth, setting out his aduer|sarie in the vilest and most deformed features that he can deuise? and yet he knowes him not neither. Nowe where it pleaseth him to saye, that M. PENRI hath just as many learned of his side, as <HI>H. N.</HI> the prince of the <HI>Familie of Loue:</HI> as I woulde not wish M. D. to be therein ouer hastie to sweare, so yet if it were so, he knows that that ouer-worne argument drawne onely from the multitude, can be no stronger for him, then it hath bene heretofore for the papists. But it shoulde fall out nowe (this being a point that hath not beene heretofore greatly looked into) that there should be any more of M. PENRIES minde hereafter, I doe not see but that M. <HI>Some</HI> may in a sort thanke himselfe for it, and that among many other reasons, this may very well be one, that your Doctor hath caried himselfe so loosely and distemperedly in the cause, seeking ra|ther to plague the man, then to cleare the matter. For when men (desirous euen in simplicitie of heart to learne the trueth) shall sensiblye perceaue that so famous and learned aman as M. <HI>Some</HI> reputeth him selfe to bee, litle inferiour in aunciencie, (as some

And yet what wil you say if after al this rage &amp; chol|ler, he be so kind harted to grant M. <HI>Penri</HI> the cause? Surely I am deceaued else, and therefore I pray you tel me your judgment.

<P>Well (howsoeuer in discretion or otherwise, in a kind of conceitednesse, he may happely overshut him selfe) you tel me that questionlesse he is learned: It may be so, neither wil I say against it: I knowe there may be wine enough in the seller, when there is non in the cuppe, and it may bee that M. <HI>Some</HI> in this en|coumpter against M. <HI>Penri,</HI> did chuse rather to look vp his learning against the rising of some billowe or tempest, then to stand powring it out against so weak an aduersarie, whom his conceite might casely en|nough be ouerthrowne with a blast of words: But the thing we stand vpon is this, that howe learned soeuer he be, he hath shewed litle of it in this treatise.

<P>In these, with the <HI>begging of the question,</HI> and the <HI>praising of himselfe,</HI> lieth the sum of his whole booke, I beleeue, I say, you cannot bringe me many thinges out of his treatise, but it may easily be referred to on of these. And these you knowe be noe such fortresses but that they may easily be battered and laide flatt to th'earth by a weker Cannon then euer <HI>M. Penri</HI> shote in his life. By the way I pray you remember, that I doe not in any sorte take exceptions to <HI>M.

And I am verely perswaded, (I beare soe much reuerence to the man) that if it were his doing, he wrote it altogether without studie, as it were vp|on a spleene, or in hast as he was riding to <HI>Lambeth.</HI> Nowe for the first point which is his <HI>bitter &amp; over|passionate speaches,</HI> I thinke you haue heard inough al|ready,

for no longer a treatise then that is, I dare say you thinke it was enough euea of conscience. For the second, vz. his <HI>autos ephe,</HI> that is his bare and peremp|tory assertions, if you finde that in any eight penny booke of some 40. leaues or there abouts, (for I think of it selfe it be not much bigger) your D. hath cloyed our eares with aboue 400. of those speches, without <NOTE PLACE="marg">Master Some hath in his book, aboue 400. naked assertions.</NOTE> either sappe or salt in them, will you not thinke it strange? To tel you the very truth, I haue taken some paines to reckon them lease by leafe, and I finde them as I tel you aboue 400. much after the nature &amp; com|plection of these: <HI>you are not ready: you are to seeke in the principles of diuinity: you knowe not your ignorance: your speaches are very idle: it is noe greate matter what you say: your bolt is soone shotte, your water is very shal|lowe: your eies are not matches, such trisles are toe base for your greate spirits: your conclusion is nothing else but an.

He that wanteth woode must burne turse: your writings are like the winde.

And if I should goe one I thinke I shoulde tyre you: I hope you will witnesse with me, though there may be some little eloquence, yet there is noe greate learninge, Logicke, or diuini|tie in this.

For these be called questi|ons without controuersie. Alasse, that reading doth aedifie, considering what a great auncient M. <HI>Some</HI> is, might very well, for any thing we see, have bene left to one of his <HI>Iunior</HI> pupils to haue declaimed in, be|cause it was neuer yet, our happs to meete with that man (if he were a scholler) that doubted of it. In deed if he had laid downe the question thus, <HI>Whether bare and simple reading be any part of the ministers office,</HI> this peraduenture might haue bred a demur euen among the learned: otherwise, that a minister may read, and by that his reading, some aedification may arise, as al|so that he may sing, or doe some other good thinges joyntly with the congregation, we make no question: But when he hath read or song, and done all this, then the question is: whether he haue done any thing that is peculiarly annexed, or appropriate to his office, more then to another man: For we suppose that the office of a minister, standeth onely in these 3, <HI>Prea|ching,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="13">
<HI>Prayer, Sacraments.</HI> I speake not here of disci|pline, but onely of doctrine. I knowe verye well, that there are many lawfull and commendable preparati|ons or circumstances, before a man come to th'execu|tion of his office, which cannot for all that, rightly be called anye part of the office it self. As for example, a Iudge may ride, may walk, may heare a sermon, may confer with the gentlemen &amp; Iustices, may sit downe on the bench, yea &amp; he ought in wisdom (as occasion serues) to doe al these, yet neuerthelesse the very knot &amp; execution of his office consisteth in non of al these, but only in <HI>hearing and determining,</HI> for al the rest he might aswel haue done before he was a judge. Euen so we doubt not, but that a minister may walke, may sit, may conferre with his parishioners, may distribute to the poore, may sing, may reade the Scriptures, either priuately or publikely (yea and al these in their time &amp; place with a good conscience, but yet al this while (say we) he is not come to the very marowe and exe|cution of his office, til he come, <HI>To deuide the woorde aright:</HI> &amp;c. because all the rest, he might wel enough haue done before he was a minister. For if you should aske me now, by what thing a christian man is singled out from a meere natural man, I cannot well answere you by his speach, because that you know, is incident to al men by nature, therefore I must answere you, by <HI>the holy profession of his religion.</HI> Eue~ so, if you aske me what is the thing that singles out a minister in his o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ce from other christians, if I should answere you, <HI>bare reading,</HI> you wold laugh at me, for it soundeth to harsshe in the eares of the learned: <HI>explosa est senten|cia,</HI> it is hissed out of the Scholes, that vnlesse poore M. <HI>Deane</HI> of Satum take it vp againe, I beleeue it wil lie in the chanel these 20. yeares before any man be so madde to touch it. Therefore I answere you, it is
<PB N="21" REF="13">
not his reading but his <HI>sound preaching in a lawefull function</HI> that seuereth him from other men: Neither if you marke it, doth our Sauiour himselfe in that spe|cial charge of his to his Apostles, couple <HI>reading</HI> with <HI>Baptizing</HI> but preaching, bidding them <HI>goe preach and baptize:</HI> And put case her majestie, should commaund a meere lay man to reade the Scriptures publikely in the Church, should this man sinne in refusing or no? I would gladly knowe. I take it he should, because there is no warraunt to the contrarie in the worde: on the other side, if she sholde enjoine a meere lay man to take vnto him the pastoral office, by deuiding the worde and dealing with the sacraments, this man I suppose should sinne grieuously in obeying, because he ought rather to die, then to vsurp that office with|out the lawful calling of the church, so that the bare and sole authoritie of the Magistrate, is sufficient for th'one but not for the other. But this by the way, is but my poore judgment, whereby it may appeare to you, that <HI>simple reading,</HI> in what account so euer it be amongst men, yet is it not as I conceiue, the thing that doth single out a minister from another christi|an. It must be only (as I tolde you before,) <HI>the sound preaching of the word in a laweful function. &amp;c.</HI> Beare witnesse I pray you, that I speake heere of <HI>sound prea|ching,</HI> that is, of deuiding the worde aright which the Apostle calleth <HI>orthotomein,</HI> I speake not of <HI>babling</HI> or of handeling a text with a Curricombe, in that I joine with M. <HI>Some</HI> with al my hart, and therefore I wish he had bene with me the 10. of Nouember last, at a cer|taine Church by the exchange, I thinke they cal it Bartholmewe church, where it may be his ears would haue glowed, and (if he durst haue bene so bolde,) I doe not thinke but he would haue condemnned the preacher and that worthely for his babling. For there
<PB N="22" REF="14">
he might haue heard him fetch many vagaries, and spend the most of his time in invectiues against good men, telling th'audience to this effect. <HI>That for the pa|pists thanks be to God, we need not so greatly feare them, for they were through the vigilans and wisedome of the magistrate reasonably hampered, god be blessed for it: but now the magistrate was onely to cast his eye on the phan|tasticall crue, such as troubled the peace of the Church, o|therwise there might fall out many mischiefes: For so was it done to the Donatists in S. Augustines time, and so to other heretikes in other times.</HI> And naming another D. of the Church, either Basill or Chrisostome I take it, I knowe not well whether: he tolde them greatly to their comforts, <HI>That he would first tell them his wordes in greeke, &amp; afterward in English,</HI> and so he did, belike because they should know that he was a grecian: what a sweet receipt was that trow ye, to such of the people as were either sicke, or troubled in mind? I heare that <NOTE PLACE="marg">This prea|cher (as I vn|derstoode since, vvas M. Some himselfe.</NOTE> M. <HI>Some</HI> vseth to come to that Church himselfe som|time: I pray you when you see him, be in hande with him to shake vp that snuffing preacher for his babling</P>
<P>Farther I pray you beare witnesse with me, that in singling out his minister from other men, I do ad to, <HI>The sound preaching of the word, A lawful function.</HI> For as I knowe that giftes alone cannot make a minister without a calling, so on th'other side do I thinke, that the bare calling of the Church alone, is not sufficient neither to make a minister, for so might a woman be a minister, whiche <HI>M. Some</HI> himselfe denies: But both these meeting in one man, that is, giftes and calling together, these I take it, do make a full minister to vs ward, though there be a <HI>Nullitie</HI> in regard of some in|ward manne that we know not of. Now whereas some doe tell vs, that <HI>Admissio indignorum ab Ecclesia non tollit naturam &amp; essentiam Ministerij:</HI> that is, <HI>The ad|mission
<PB N="23" REF="14">
of vnworthy ones by the Church, doth not altoge|ther destroy the nature of the ministerie:</HI> As wee were much to blame if we woulde striue against this, so it seemeth they say little or nothing to the matter in question, for th'ambiguitie is in this worde <HI>Indigno|rum, vnworthinesse.</HI> I know that a practizing papist is an vnworthie subject, but yet a subject: So may a man of vicious life be a minister, though an vnworthy mi|nister: But on th'other side, what say you to these? <HI>A dumb man from his cradle is an vnworthy orator: A blind man from his cradle is an vnworthie painter.</HI> These be good sence and good Englishe both, and yet it is vn|possible that any of these should be at all, such as they are named to be: eyther the first an Orator, or the Int|ter a Paynter: And therefore I take it (by their fauor) that this word <HI>vnworthinesse,</HI> is something too gene|rall, and thereby somthing too weake, to expresse suf|ficiently, <HI>Questiones &amp; controuersiae energiam:</HI> because it may as well be applied to that which is, as to that which is not, and as M. <HI>Penri</HI> saith, by a mangled bo|die, that some be so mangled that they haue no life in them at all. So say we by these <HI>vnworthy ones:</HI> some be so vnworthie, as they are not at all that thing whereof they haue their name. And therefore where M. <HI>Some</HI> saieth, <HI>That the Sacramentes are not the better for the worthinesse, nor the worse for th'vnworthinesse of the man:</HI> wee yeeld he saith true, and yet nothing to the matter: yet me thinkes it had bene a great deale nee|rer the point, if in liew of these vnworthie ones, they had incerted these words, <HI>Corum qui non sunt omnino ministerij capaces,</HI> that is, <HI>Which are not at all capable of the ministery:</HI> and then we suppose the assertion had bene sound and to the purpose: For not th'admission of euery <HI>vnworthy one</HI> (in that in deede they say true) but th'admission of such an <HI>vnworthie one,</HI> as is alto|gether
<PB N="24" REF="15">
vncapable of the ministerie (as infants, women fooles, mad men, dumbe men, &amp;c) those we saye, doe wholly ouerthrowe the nature and essence of the mi|nisterie, and is (as the lawyers cal it) <HI>a none est factum</HI> or as a lease that is void assoone as it is made. Where|vpon if they reply, that <HI>Sola Ecclesia vocat, The Church onely calleth</HI> in this age, and that God doeth not now (as in times past by <HI>Paule</HI> and others) call extraordi|narily, or miraculously from heauen, but hath resigned that power solely and whollie to his Churche, wee graunt it is true: But then the question is, what kinde of power this is, whether it be a power without ex|ception, or a limited power? Wee saye it is a limited power &amp; hath his bounds, that it cannot passe (I speak not here <HI>de iure,</HI> but <HI>de posse)</HI> And indeed it must needs be so in dispight of our harts, though we should burst our selues in wrangling about it. For first I am sure they will not denie, that the Churche in this her ad|mission, is limited onely to liuing creatures, for if she should make an image a minister, there were present|ly a <HI>nullitie.</HI> Secondly she is limited onely to the seed of <HI>Adam,</HI> for if she shoulde make an Ape a minister, there were presently a <HI>nullitie.</HI> Thirdly out of the seed of <HI>Adam</HI> she is limited only to the sexe of man, if she should make a woman a minister, there were present|ly a <HI>nullitie.</HI> Out of the sexe of man she is limited on|ly (say we) to those that can speake, and haue the vse of reason: for if shee shoulde make a naturall, a madd man, or a dumbe man a minister, there were present|ly (as we think) a <HI>nullitie.</HI> Now M. <HI>Penri</HI> goeth an ase further, and saith, that of those men that can speake, &amp; haue the vse of reason, shee is limited onely to suche as haue gifts, and are in some measure <HI>Thithacticoi,</HI> or else (as he holdeth) there is also a <HI>nullitie.</HI> And here is that so hainous &amp; blasphemous error of his, that hath
<PB N="25" REF="15">
so distempered M. <HI>Some,</HI> and for the which he would so faine haue the magistrate to conjure him. Whiche, whether it be an error or no, as for mine owne part, I am not able to defyne it, so yet doe I see, that when men haue runne themselues windlesse in wanderinge, yet must they of force in th'ende come to this, to en|quire, <HI>Qualis est potestas Ecclesiae in admissione ministro rum, &amp; quibus circumscripta finibus,</HI> that is, what kind of power the Church hath, and within what boundes to be limited, for therein consisteth the very marowe and sinewes of the whole controuersie, to know how far the Church may stretch her arme in this case. Yet by the way I cannot but muze at one thing, that the popish churches should finde more grace and fauout in this our Metropolitan State, then the reformed churches of other nations. For it is graunted you see, that the popish shauelings and their priests of Baal haue forsooth a calling though afaultie one, but doe you think that this will be granted to those of our mi|nisters that were only ordained by the reformed chur|ches beyond sea? Nay soft, Be judge by M. <HI>Whitting|ham,</HI> whome it is knowne th'Archb. of Yorke called in question for his calling, in that he was made mini|ster at <HI>Geneua:</HI> I haue heard also, that M. <HI>Trauers</HI> when he was thrust out of the Temple, was bidden by my Lord of Cant. to proue his calling, alleaging that he was no minister, (for what authoritie saith he in his choller, hath M. <HI>Cart.</HI> to make a minister?) Therefore you may see the lucke of it, popish wret|ches and Apostates, breathed vppon only by such as themselues are, haue a callinge, but other worthye men (caled to the ministery by worthy churches) must sine a newe for their letters of orders, is not this good stuffe thinke you? Wel sithence it is knowne that M. <HI>Trauers</HI> was in deede ordeined a minister by a refor|med
<PB N="26" REF="16">
church beyond the sea, I woulde your D. durst in his next discourse, be as kinde to that poore ministery of his, as he hath bene hithertoe to the popish priest|hood, that is of curtesie, (in respect of the credit of the <HI>Reformed churches,)</HI> to giue it some allowance of a calling, yea albeit his grace of Cant. should stand against it. For he knowes it can be no more blasphe|mie in M. <HI>Penri,</HI> to say that the popish church can not make a minister, then it is in an other greter man to say that the reformed churches cannot make a mi|nister. But I feare me M. <HI>Some</HI> is not at leasure, he wil pleasure vs in an other matter, for such a dash with a penne as this might happely breede a scabbe, why is it not well that he taketh our parts in the <HI>Nullitie</HI> of womens ministerie: but still men will be regrating more at his hands? Therefore because we will holde him where we haue him, I wil be so bold in that point to recorde his words, lest in time he giue vs the slippe men growe so giddy headed nowe a daies: <HI>They that haue heard my sermons</HI> saith he, <HI>or read my writings doe knowe very wel that I alowe of non to preach the worde,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">81</NOTE> <HI>or administer the sacraments, without a calling, therfore neither woman nor priuate man:</HI> plainly implying that it is vnpossible for a woman to haue any calling: I promise you, I was glad when I reade it with all my hart, for I was halfe a fraide before, I tel you that we should haue some learned paradoxe, or some godly treatise in the defence of the ministery of weomen, with this or the like prety gloze, <HI>Quoad substantiam,</HI> but not <HI>quoad qualitatem:</HI> or else with this. <HI>That they should haue had a calling though a faltie one,</HI> which had bene but <HI>peccatum ecclesiae:</HI> or else with this, <HI>that the sexe had bene but of th'essence of a lawful &amp; good mini|ster, but not of a minister simply,</HI> and that for vs it shold suffice only to muffie our faces, with a setled perswa|sion
<PB N="27" REF="16">
that <HI>Ministerium</HI> is <HI>datum,</HI> and <HI>acceptum,</HI> and so hang wholly vpon th'ordination of the church with|out farther questioning or inquirye. Al this I tel you, I was a fraide of, but nowe sithence we are sure of M. <HI>Some</HI> one our side, we shal feare the lesse the assaults of others, as hauing on string more to our bowe then we looked for. For he is as learned in his conceite as the best of them, and if he take a pitch, I beleue he wil be as hot as the best of them toe for neede. And thus by occasion of your D. worthy position, <HI>that reading doth edisie,</HI> haue I fallen as you see <HI>cursorie</HI> into the question of the ministers office, and so of the calling of the ministerie: It is but my poore verdicte you see, and therefore you neede not make a recorde of it, vn|lesse you list, for you knowe what a deep clarke I am, if you desire farther to be satisfied in the point, I re|ferr you ouer to him, to whome the matter especially appertaineth, who I hope will either answere his ad|uersarie with lesse ven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">me and more modesty then he finds at his hands, or els giue over the cause in silence: For mine owne part, as my skil is not greate, so doe I not hould any thing, but I am apt enough to recall it, if you or a meaner man then you, can bringe me <HI>the word to refute it,</HI> but hithertoe I confesse I see noe far|ther.</P>
<P>Well your D. hath yet an other wipe at th'igno|rant Welchman, which I had like to haue forgotten, the best is, it is with an <HI>if</HI> aswel as the rest: <HI>If you thynk</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">176</NOTE> saith he, <HI>that al the popish sort, that died in the popish Church are damned, you thinke absurdly:</HI> most true they that thinke so, thinke absurdly in deede, and I pro|mise you, therein I must hould with <HI>M.

of his, for as yet I beleeue this monster is vnborne, &amp; vnheard of. And how if <HI>M. Penri</HI> or some of the fan|tastical crewe should nowe in riquitall say thus. <HI>If you thinke M.

But if he doe not soe, then belike he hath his <HI>supersedeas,</HI> and discharge from <HI>errors, absurdities, &amp; blasphemies</HI> and al. This is some comfort yet, and may happen fall out wel in th'issue, for these <HI>isfs, imaginations &amp; supposalls</HI> of men, do weigh so light in the ballance of the wise, that they may as easely with one and the same breath be defaced, as euer they were coyned at the first, for who can let a man to batter in peeces that prety I|mage which he made himselfe. Therefore for a full answere to all these <HI>isss,</HI> if I were as <HI>M. Penri,</HI> I would no more, but faire lappe vp this sentence in some let|ter, and send it <HI>M.

That being th'onely office of God him selfe, it must needs be too much presumption, and be|yond the reache and commission of any mortall man, so to define: But if it had pleased M. <HI>Some</HI> to haue ad|ded but one word more to his sentence, &amp; set it down thus: <HI>All the popish sort that dye papistes in the popishe Church.</HI> If I say, he had added but this word <HI>papist,</HI> the~ do I not see (by his fauor) hat there had bene any ab|surditie in it at al: For we hold, that to him that dieth a papist (let him do neuer so many good workes, and bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">lde if it were possible, ten thousande Colledges or Churches) the verie gates and porteculleses of Gods mercie are quite shutt vp, and all those his glorious work, how sweet soeuer they may be to others, shall be but wrack and misery to himself.

Nay M. <HI>Foxe</HI> saith flatly, he dieth a <HI>Lutheran,</HI> for Iustification by merit and works, is the very heart, life and soule of papistrie.</P>
<P>By these and the rest, it may easily appeare to you, that your D. might very well haue spared the better halfe of his paines, and haue done full as much good as he hath. They say it is an euill bargaine that no bo|die thriues by. Therefore if it should fall out so nowe, that for all these sweete lessons, drawne with such ad|visement into seuerall chapters, neither M. <HI>Some</HI> him|selfe should be the more reuerenced, nor M. <HI>Penri</HI> &amp; his disciples the better instructed: what should a man say to this world? but that <HI>Satione</HI> belike had a frow|ning aspect when the bookes were sent to the presse. Now if you aske me what should be the reason why so many things out of question, shoulde be thus jum|bled &amp; enterlaced as it were, in one rolle, with things of question and controuersie indeede, let this suffize you, that there is a misterie in it, yea and such a miste|rie, as peraduenture euerie one seeth not, &amp; I beleeue I could go neer to gesse where M.

Nowe in this case whoe must be judge? If I shoulde name <HI>Oxforde</HI> men vnto you, it may be you woulde thinke me partial. Therefore seeing <HI>M.

can be noe indifferencie in this at all. <HI>M.

But in this fowle rent of judgment betwixt your 2. D. what will <HI>M. Some</HI> say to this? He that was last B. of Norwitch and is nowe (if I be not deceiued,) ether of Peterborough or of Worcester, calling once before him a godly mi|nister of Suffolke, one M. <HI>Swette,</HI> about some small breach of the booke in the administration of baptisme when the saide M. <HI>Swette</HI> for his just defence, had brought forth the iudgment of M. <HI>Beza,</HI> the good B. in his angrye moode replied thus, what tellest thou me of <HI>Beza?

In like manner my L. of Cant. hauing once before him one <HI>Thomas Settle</HI> a preacher, about some doctrine that he had taught of Christs descending into Hell, when the said M. <HI>Settle</HI> alleaged for himselfe, that the doc|trine

taught by him, had not only the warrant of the holy scriptures, but also the approbation &amp; testimony of the best writers of our age, as namely, of M. <HI>Caluin</HI> and others: <HI>What tellest thou vs of Caluin?</HI> (Quoth the B. in very disdainful sort,) <HI>I tel thee there are here that can teach Caluin.</HI> At which time, there satte in commission, th'Archb. him selfe, the Deane of West|minster, D.

<P>Therefore for that point of relying so wholly and

absolutely vppon the authoritie of men, (which as I haue saide, is an other great piller of your doctors booke,) I doe not see but that M. <HI>Some</HI> (consideringe howe faine he would be thought somebody in the eie of the learned,) hath by this meanes rather disaduan|taged him selfe, by bringing the credite of his owne judgment into baser account, the~ it may be, his srends would haue w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">shed him, who might otherwise perad|venture in some things, haue conceiued as reuerently of him as of <HI>Calvin</HI> himself. I remember I heard once a notable diuine say in pulpit. <HI>That he was not worthye to be a minister of the Gospell, that could not in som mea|sure wring sorth the sence of the holy ghoste, euen by the Scripture it selfe without an interpretor:</HI> So far was he, from resting in any mans judgement, that he did alto|gether condemne those that brought nothing else with them into the pulpit, but what they had gathe|red out of Augustine, Cyprian, Aretius, Caluin, or som such old or new writer. And I put case Caluin &amp; Beza had neuer written, howe woulde M. <HI>Some</HI> haue done? would his breasts trow ye, haue bene so dryed vp, that he should neuer haue giuen milke of his owne? that had bene pitie. I confesse to you I reuerence D. <HI>Fulke,</HI> and no disparagement to any, I thinke him vniuersal|ly as well learned as euer <HI>Caluin</HI> or <HI>Beza</HI> was: But what then? yet were it you know, but a poore judge|ment in matter of controuersie, barely to saye thus, <HI>I rest wholly in his judgement.</HI> I had thought that where <HI>Caluine</HI> and <HI>Beza</HI> had beene wide, as no question but they are wide somtimes (for I dare not trust him I tell you that neuer helde errour) there a man might haue had some resolution at M. <HI>Somes</HI> handes, with reasons alleaged of their seueral slips and ouersights, but now I perceiue he that had made such a journey to master <HI>Some,</HI> should haue but lost his labour, and haue beene
<PB N="38" REF="22">
frustrate of his hope, for it seemeth he woulde neuer haue made him other answer then this: <HI>Irest in their iudgements.</HI> In which regard, there is some reason yet, that M. <HI>Bridges</HI> shoulde be priuiledged aboue others, thogh the good soule do not rest in any of their judg|mentes, because he doth not lightly rest in his owne, for if he chance to set downe any thing in one booke, he is commonly so kinde hearted, to pull it backe a|gain in another, and what reason were it, he should be more tyed to them then to himselfe? Well, for all this jesting, I would you would take some paines to recon|cile me your two Cambridge doctors. I know perad|uenture what you will say, that you are sure M. <HI>Some</HI> is nothing so bleare-eyed as M. <HI>Bridges,</HI> and therefore to a wise man the choyce is soone made which way to encline: wherein as I haue smal reason to dissent from you; (because I do not thinke I tell you, that for that disease, which they call <HI>Th'opolexie of the braine,</HI> the Deane of Sarum hath many fellowes of his standing in Christendome) so do I the rather thinke it strange, that so graue a man as M. <HI>Some</HI> woulde be reputed to be, should be so bewitched, to followe in any sort the sleps and traces of him, whom (in regard of all sounde knowledge and judgement) his owne very heart must needs condemne for a drudge. And why then should your D. so egerly pursue his poore aduersarie, by en|deuoring to make him hateful to the state, as if there were no way to cleare the matter, then by crying out on the Magistrate to conjure the man, sithence Ma|ster <HI>Bridges</HI> vseth it? Why should he so peremptorily condemne him he knowes not, with all the bitter and evenimed speaches he can deuise, sithence M. <HI>Bridges</HI> vseth it? Why should he huddle in a number of <HI>isses,</HI> and strange opinions, that all the worlde knowes his aduersarie disavoweth, sithence M. <HI>Bridges</HI> vseth it?
<PB N="39" REF="22">
In summe, why should he not hate and detest al those bad sleights, that sauor neither of learning nor hone|stie, sithence so brazen a face as <HI>Bridges</HI> doth both vse them, practize them, and can scarce make a good fly|logisme without them.</P>
<P>Now for that point of <HI>Begging the question,</HI> though it please him neuer so much to florish it ouer with the name of <HI>Beza</HI> and others, telling M. <HI>Penri</HI> that <HI>His</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">8<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>answere is beggerly, &amp;c.</HI> Yet by his fauor, he cannot so wipe it away, but that it may justly bee charged and recharged vpon his head with a witnesse. As to begin wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">hal, what cal you this I pray you? <HI>my reason is</HI> (saith he) <HI>The popish Church is a Churche, though an vnsounde</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">163 175</NOTE> <HI>Church:</HI> Twice or thrise at the least, he is at coste to bestow this vpon vs as a reason, and what is this else, but a begging of the question. For howe if a man will not be so kinde hearted, to grant him that it is not a|ny visible Church of God at al, where is he then? The~ you know he must about againe, with a newe voyage into Portingall for more great reasings, for this rea|son will not serue his turne. And that we haue small reason to yeeld him this, shall appeare by Gods grace hereafter, because all the reasons that euer we coulde see hitherto, haue bene in our judgements too weake to prooue it to be anye Churche of God at all. In the meane season, that it is doubtfull &amp; questionable at the least: me thinks a man that so vanteth himselfe of reading &amp; knowledge, as M. <HI>Some</HI> doth, should not be ignoraunt. We see <HI>Anthonie Tyrrell,</HI> one of the Semi|narie priesies that lately recanted at Paules, makes a doubt of it in these wordes, <HI>If that may be called</HI> (saith he) <HI>a Churche, that is infested with so great a contagion,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">4<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> which being aduisedly perused, seene and allowed, &amp; so suffered to passe the presse without a razure, impli|eth that (howsoeuer M. <HI>Some</HI> woulde ouer rule the
<PB N="40" REF="23">
case, as he doth many others with his Censociall rod) there is neither danger nor heresie to holde the con|trarie, sithence our Church doth allow men to make an <HI>if</HI> at it. What means your D. then to plead it in e|vidence, as an vnsuspected testimonie, when the thing is either disputable, or cleane against him. Wherein if he falted but once yet, as it were a crashe and away to recreat himselfe, he were to be borne with: But it see|meth he hath some delight in it, in that he plods vpon it in a maner in euery lease, so that if his last treatise be well examined, it will be found, that he hath proo|ued the question, by the thing in question, &amp; brought in one razed record to prooue another, no lesse then 30. or 40. times at the least. As in this 192. pag. where he gathereth, that M. <HI>Penri</HI> should say that <HI>the dispen|sation of our readers ministerie doth feede none,</HI> therein he chargeth him <HI>To erre grosly:</HI> And what is his reason, for it is like you knowe, to be some reason of waight, that should so apparantly conuince a man of so grosse an error: <HI>My reason is</HI> (saith he) <HI>that the Sacramentes administred by them, doe comfort and feede the soules of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">192</NOTE> <HI>the godly communicantes: for the vertue of the Sacra|ments, dependeth not vpon any minister whatsoeuer, &amp;c.</HI> Here marke I pray you, he takes it for graunted, that both the things deliuered be sacraments, and that the men deliuering them be ministers, which as I co~ceiue is the very maine point in controuersie, betwixt his aduersarie and him, vz. <HI>Whether our readers be mini|sters or no, and thereby whether we can be assured to re|ceiue any Sacrament at their handes.</HI> Notwithstanding all which, your learned D. as if he were strongly be|taken with M. <HI>Bridges</HI> his swimming in the head, will needes pawn vs this for reason, thinking belike, to go smooth away withall, <HI>That they are ministers</HI> forsooth, <HI>and that the Sacraments from their hands, doe both feed
<PB N="41" REF="23">
and comfort, &amp;c.</HI> As if I to prooue vnto you, that our Bb. should haue no superioritie ouer other ministers, should bring in this for a reason, <HI>That their callings are vnlawfull:</HI> Though this were true (as heauen and earth knowes it to be most true, howsoeuer like mise|rable men they striue to avoid it) yet you might justly take exceptio~s to my proof, as a flat <HI>begging of the que|stion.</HI> Euenso look how often it shall please <HI>M. Some</HI> to warble vppon any of these notes, ether <HI>That the popish Church is a church, though an vnsound Church, or that bare readers be ministers, or that the Sacraments from their hands doe both feede and comfort. &amp;c.</HI> So often are we not afraide to tel him and tel him againe, that it is ameere childish <HI>begging of the question,</HI> vnworthie of any ma~ that beareth the face of lerning. And yet in this veine, doth he very nere spend &amp; co~sume himself thorow our his whole booke: Talke of a <HI>sacrament,</HI> why he proues they deliuer it thus, <HI>they haue a calling:</HI> Speake of a <HI>Calling,</HI> he proues it thus, <HI>they deliuer a sa|crament.</HI> And thus backward and foreward, vppe and downe, from one end to another, he werieth both him selfe and the reader, so cloying vs with <HI>A sacrament by a calling,</HI> and <HI>A calling by a sacrament,</HI> as it is able to make a horse to breake his halter, and me thinkes ye Cambridge men should blushe to thinke that euer any mans penne should be driuen to that penury: nei|ther doe I thinke that you can bringe me the like pa|terne in any treatise of that bignesse written since Iur maiesties raigne. And yet this is the man that wil haue vs knowe forsooth, that there is nothing to be had at his hands <HI>in diuinitie matters, but by force of argument, if you thinke</HI> (saith he) <HI>that I will come of otherwise you</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">119</NOTE> <HI>are in a wrong boxe: for I intend not to be at your whisle &amp;c.</HI> The best is if you marke it, he speaks heere onely of diuinitie matters, and nothing els, so that if a man
<PB N="42" REF="24">
should happen to deale with him in <HI>Lawe, Phisicke,</HI> or <HI>Philosophie,</HI> there is some hope yet we should finde him more tractable. But in diuinitie matters there is noe mercy with him, he hath tolde vs what we shall trust vnto, either arguments or nothing, yet I woulde you would aske him in his eare, whether a Deanrye or a Bishopricke, would not preuaile as much with him in mat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">er of Diuinitie, as the best argument in Christendome? For if nothing will doe good of him but arguments, howe shal poore <HI>M. Bridges</HI> and I doe with him, that haue scarse a good argument betwixte vs to throw at a dogs heade? We had best kepe vs out of his way, til the edge of these arguments be some|thing overworne, and that we hope wil not be longe, especially if he light once in one of these swete Dean|ries or Bishopricks. Then I trust a man may speake with him vnder a couple of Capons, then I hope hee wil not be so hasty to fright vs with these forcible ar|guments. For it may be he wil not be at leasure, he wil haue somewhat els to doe: his Chappell and his Or|ganes, with other such implements and impediments moe, will keepe him I trust from doing vs any greate hurt, either in Lodgicke or Diuinitie while he liues. Then we looke rather he should doe as the rest of his comperes are woont to doe, that is, liue of the stocke, and waste of the stoare, till they be within a little of bankerour: as for arguments and matter of controuer|sie, because they growe olde themselues, alasse, they may leaue that to <HI>Watson</HI> or <HI>Walton, Haslop</HI> or <HI>Mun|day,</HI> or some such sweete Chapleine of theirs, whoe haue excelent witts at whipcoard conclusions, to ma|nicle these puritans with.</P>

much And you may tel your Doct. from, me that cer|tainly if they were Courtiers they did but flout him, if they were learned and of judgment in deede, they did but flatter him And therefore for mine owne part I cannot so much condemne him in this case, if in the want of Heraulds and some other good friends, he be forced as it were, to make an emblazure of his owne coate armor himselfe, who can blame him then: if in speaking of the ignorant ministers he tel vs him|selfe, when no man els will tel vs for him, <HI>That his writings and sermons are not</HI> Ajax <HI>shield to couer them,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">150</NOTE> <HI>but the Lords sworde to cut them?</HI> So that if any man be desirons newe to finde out the swoorde of the Lord, where shall he redilier come by it, then about the ex|change or those places where <HI>M.

In deed if he coulde so cut them, that they might be quite cut of the ministerie, it were a happy cuttinge both for them and our church. But that he is not the man that is like to worke this cure, we see by his lookes. For as our Sauiour Christ saith to his disciples, <HI>This kinde of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Deuill is not cast out but by praier and fasting.</HI> So wee say to <HI>M.

it is like he speaketh this altogether in the ouerwee|ning of his owne sufficiencie, to make vs knowe what ods there is betwixt his poore aduersarie and him, o|therwise wee see no reason why the defence of Gods trueth (according to the measure of his talentes and place) should not euerie way be as deare and precious vnto another as to M. <HI>Some.</HI> I perceiue it woulde di|stemper him vnreasonably, if one should tell him that Mast. <HI>Penri</HI> hath discharged a better duetie to Gods Church in one sixe leaues, then euer M. <HI>Some</HI> did in all that euer he wrote, and yet I thinke he that should say so, might haue hands enow to subscribe to it, euen of the godliest and best affected subjects in the lande: but I purpose not to enter into that comparison, let eche man speake as his heart hath felt comfort, and God giue M. <HI>Some</HI> an humbler spirit. Only this much I thinke one may safely and truely say, that in all that euer M. <HI>Penri</HI> hath written (though M. <HI>Some</HI> haue beprouded him I know not how many times) no man shal be able justly to finde any one dashe with a pen, sauoring so palpably the corruption of the heart, tho|row the good liking of himself, as is in a hundred pla|ces of M. <HI>Somes</HI> book.

Why did your D. neuer read <HI>Laus propria sor|descit in ore?</HI> Tush he is at a point you see, and goeth on like a censurer in his impious vaine, telling master <HI>Penri, That as yet he maketh very meane account of his</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">66</NOTE> <HI>iudgement:</HI> And againe in another place to the same effect, he presseth him shrewdly: <HI>You desire pardone of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">82 83</NOTE> <HI>me, if you recant</HI> (saith he) <HI>you shall haue an easie sute, o|therwise I doe and will account very basely of you:</HI> Was not the man in a golden dreame thinke you, when he perswaded himselfe, that the whole poize of the mat|ter lay vpon his account?

When you shew me the like of any learned protestant of our time, I will then yeelde my selfe faltie, and saye I did him wrong.

But is not this foule play thinke you, that M. <HI>Some</HI> wil enforce a question vpon his adueasarie whether he wil or noe, M. <HI>Penri</HI> vtter|ly rejecting it in so expresse terms calling it <HI>an odious &amp; impertinent controuersie,</HI> and telling M. <HI>Some, that he hath therein quickned a dead controuersy, not vnlike to breede stirs through the wrangling spirits of this age. &amp;c.</HI> And why may not he I pray you take the same li|bertie
<PB N="52" REF="29">
in this question as M. <HI>Some</HI> doth in an other or the like? For in this point, <HI>whether infants ought ra|ther to be kept vnbaptized, then to be presented to popish Baptysme,</HI> hatken I pray you to M. <HI>Somes resolution:</HI> After he hath told vs <HI>Caluins</HI> judgment, he shutteth vp the whole with this good loose: <HI>I confesse freely that this is a very waighty question, (but in this our time</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">181</NOTE> <HI>a needelesse question, and that men of great excellencie for learning haue their seueral iudgments: and speake your conscience: If</HI> M. <HI>Penri</HI> should answere euen so to th'other <HI>question, vz. Whether that which is deliuered by popish and vnpreaching ministers, be a sacrament or no,</HI> were it any greate blasphemie; If he should chance to say in effecte as <HI>M.

<P>O but you will say, that though M. <HI>Penri</HI> do denie it to be the question, yet of consequence it must needs be the question whether he will or no: for if the po|pishe and dumbe ministers haue no ministerie at all, then that which either they haue deliuered, or do de|liuer can be no sacrament, and so her majestie and a number of excellent men mo, must be vnbaptized at this day. This beleeue me is a shrewd blowe, and may well be called <HI>a Silogisme in Bocardo,</HI> and yet if her majesties name were left out, it might peraduenture bee avoided with more ease: But I praye you what thinke you of the second point of M. <HI>Somes</HI> first trea|tize, <HI>That a godly prince may not suffer any religion but the true religion, either publikely or priuatly in his domi|nions,</HI> is not that a sound point agreable to the word?

tricke to overthrowe it: namely thus, <HI>Her Maiesty all Christendome knowes to be a godly Prince, and in that regard, through the great mercy of God fewe princes vn|der the Heauen to be compared vnto her, yet hath shee neuertheles suffered the Ambassadors of sorrain nations to haue their Masse, (which shee must needs knowe to be Idolatrie) within her dominions.</HI> Therefore either that proposition of M. <HI>Somes</HI> is false, or els he must be for|ced to yeeld that her maiestie is in that regard <HI>vngod|ly:</HI> And if he doe so, then I haue him where I woulde haue him, &amp; marke I pray you, how I can fetch him a|bout for neede with a proper short declamation (but truly it is a sweet on) of the lerned <HI>Bridges, Secundum ordine Sarum</HI> in this maner: <HI>Yea my learned masters are ye good at that? Is the winde in that dore? Are ye come after so many miraculous blessings, and such an extraordi|narie hand of God vpon her maiestie, after all that great care and indeuour she hath had to aduance the Gospell, and to succor th'afflicted members thereof, (So many thousand of christian soules hauing bin saued vnder her gouernment) are ye become I say, nowe after all this, o|penly to charge &amp; accuse her of vngodlinesse? I knowe brethren, that the best Princes vnder the Heauen, haue their seuerall infirmities: But openly to tollerate so grosse &amp; greuous a sinne against the honor of God, and the light of his trueth, this is more brethren then may well be sha|dowed by infirmitie: Therefore what shal I say?

<P>And euen thus for al the world, and no better then thus doth it seeme to me, that M. <HI>Some</HI> and his assist|ance doe consute the <HI>Nullitie</HI> of our dumbe ministers: For they haue not in the world any other arguments to fright vs with, but only that of her Maiestie, her Maiestie, which they thinke to be a byter: And it puts me in minde of a litle pretty story, that we haue of a scholler of Oxford, and a Clumperton of the Cuntry: The scholler hauing got a litle smattering of Lodge|icke, would needs threat downe the poore man that he could by Lodgicke prooue any thing against him: <HI>Namely, though he had a cudgel in his hand, yet he would prooue he had non:</HI> whereunto the Country man made answere, <HI>by my faieth if you doe so, Ile make your shoul|ders feele that I haue one:</HI> By the way, you must not thinke that this Country man was a B. for all he be|gan with his <HI>Fayth,</HI> for I would you should knowe it, there be others that can sweare besides Bb.

<P>But for the point wherein M. <HI>Some</HI> thinks he hath his aduersarie on the hippe, first wee say for the clea|ring of our selues, and we speak it even in singlenesse of heart, (be thou O God witnesse and reuenge if we lie) that we doe account her maiestie the deare childe of God, so marked from her Cradle, and so chosen from the very foundations of th'earth, whereof wee doubt not but shee hath had assured seales and testi|monies to her owne soule, not only by her outwarde and miraculous desiuerances, but by an inwarde sense and seeling of Gods mercies, she hath bene from her infancie through Gods greate mercie deliuered from the dregs of popery, &amp; thereby from one of the gates that leadeth vnto hell: She hath since that time made noe doubt, some fruteful increase in the knowledge of the truth: She hath bin kept from those soule and enormious sinns, which other great States &amp; princes haue fallen into: She hath not feared to professe and publikely to a vowe the cause, notwithstandinge the frowning threats, and practises of many other migh|tie potentates round about her: yea though her blood haue bene many wayes vnjustly sought for, and onely for the gospell sake, yet hath shee not for any suche earthly respect abandoned the cause, but hath boldly from time to time, euen with joye of heart succoured the afflicted, both at home and abroad, yea and more, it is manifest that vnder that happy and peaceable so|veraigntie of hers, many a thousand haue come to the sound knowledge of the trueth, which were before in palpable darknes. And these be to vs ward, sussicient reasons &amp; motions to put vs out of doubt, that (what|soeuer
<PB N="58" REF="32">
other wants, weaknesses &amp; infirmities she may haue incident to flesh and blood) yet that shee is the deare childe of God and right precious in his eyes: &amp; if that be so, then I hope I shall not need to stand loug about any pretie catechisme (as M. <HI>Some</HI> hath done a|bout the inabillitie of the regenerate) to proue <HI>That whom God loueth, he loueth for euer:</HI> for I do assure my self, meaner m&eacute; th&eacute; M. <HI>Some</HI> are resolued in that.

<P>First though it be very cleare, that M. <HI>Penri</HI> doth not say so, altogether disclaiming the point, as an odi|ous and fruitlesse controuersie, yet because M. <HI>Some</HI> wil stil be hagling at that biting consequent, as a man halfe starued and hungerbit for want of other suste|nance, let vs alowe for once that M. <HI>Penri</HI> did say soe in deede: what then?

<PB N="59" REF="32">
that which shal neuer be taken from her, that is of re|mission of sinns in the death &amp; righteousnes of Christ and that more is, hauing also many times bin comfor|tably fedde and refreshed at the Lords table by those holy seals of her redemption, as a farther pledg of the fauour and mercy of God, I see no reason, nor I know no vse, why after all this, that she should be brought backe againe to the sacrament of her entrance and in|grasting into the body, if it were so that she were not baptized, if there be any other mistery in the matter, I franckly confesse it is more then I see as yet. As for that ineuitable and remedilesse necessitie of the Sa|crament, which the bewitched papists doe so sottish|ly dreame of, I hope al the children of God haue long a goe turned that strange beast a grazing, as hauing bin safficiently taught: <HI>That it is not the want of the sa|crament, but the contempt and neglect of the sacrament that is damnable:</HI> Nowe her maiestie being already perswaded in her hart that shee is baptized, cannot thereby justly be said either to contemne or neglect the sacrament, because she resteth in that perswasion, howsoeuer it be, whether she be baptized or no, (be ing cleare from these 2. sinns of <HI>contempt and neglect)</HI> we are assured it shall noe kinde of waie redound to her hart, because shee is the childe of God, and wee doubte not but shee findeth and feeleth daylie those inward comforts and tokens of Gods loue towardes her, as neither the adding or iterating of th'outward sacrament can by any meanes better or increase. And if that be so, then doe I not see why M. <HI>Penri</HI> or any man els should so greatly feare that blody consequent of M. <HI>Somes,</HI> vz. <HI>If popishe ministers, be no ministers, then her Maiestie is not christened.</HI> For you see when this bugbeare is vnuizarded once, then alas it hath but the face of a sheepe as it were, and his visnomy ap|peares

nothing so terrible as it semed before.</P>
<P>O but you wil aske me peraduenture what I say to this: <HI>None vnbaptized may be admitted to the holy sup|per:</HI> I answere, that it is most true in a sorte with M. <NOTE PLACE="marg">92</NOTE> <HI>Somes</HI> distinction, vz. <HI>which are knowne to be vnbapti|zed,</HI> for those be his very words: In deede if the case be so cleared, without al question and contradiction, that both the minister &amp; the man himselfe that is to com|municate, doth assuredly know himselfe to pe vnbap|tized, then I dare not denie but there is a salt both in the minister that admitteth, and in the person that so presenteth himselfe. But one th'other side, where the man verely perswadeth him selfe that he is baptized, and the minister hath no knowledge of the contrary, (though <HI>reuera</HI> and in truth, there were noe baptisme at all) then the question is howe these doe sinne, for this I take it cannot be that sinfull ignorance that M. <HI>Some</HI> mentioneth in these wordes, <HI>ignorantia excusat non a toto sed a tanto.</HI> And I hope he will not denie <NOTE PLACE="marg">90</NOTE> that it is a sacrament, and may be a comfortable sacra|ment to him that in this perswasion doth present him|selfe at the Lords table, though in truth he had not the outward seale of baptisme besore. For where the Apostle biddeth a man <HI>to examine himselfe. &amp;c.</HI> I sup|pose it is not to be vnderstood as is he would say thus: <HI>I charge thee that among other things thou search and enquire diligintly what was done to thee, 50. 90. yeares a|goe, when thou wast an infant, whether that were true baptisme that thou diddest then receue, and whether that person that did then baptise thee, had a callinge or no: And is thou canst by no meanes bolt out the truth thereof to assure thy hart that thou wast baptised in deed then I charge thee keepe thy selfe from the holy commu|nion,</HI> I take it I say this was noe parte of th'Apostles <NOTE PLACE="marg">92</NOTE> meaning, and M. <HI>Somes</HI> owne words doe seeme in a
<PB N="61" REF="33">
sort to crosse it: <HI>This examination</HI> (saith he) <HI>consisteth in saith and repentance, which are not in them, that ei|ther</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">92</NOTE> <HI>weetingly omit, or wilfully contemne the holy Sacra|ment of baptisme:</HI> So that M. <HI>Some</HI> himselfe restraining it only to one of these 2. <HI>omission of knowledge, or con|tempt of wilfulnesse,</HI> we thinke we may safely say that where these 2. be not, there the man, (whether he be baptised or noe) may be a worthy and fruitful recey|uer. And in this case it semeth that a mans owne very hart and conscience may be a notable light and direc|tion to him, against all the wrangling spirits in the world. For if in communicating at the Lords table, thou didst euer in thy life feele any growth in thy self with a desier to rise from the wretchednesse of the first Adam, to the righteousnes of the second Adam, if I say thou didst euer feele any inward sweetenesse and comfort in thy gratious God to a thorough peace of thy conscience, and a quieting of thy soule, then assure thy selfe (against all that man or Angell can bringe against it) that where thou hast bene once so banketed, there thou hast thy warrant from the holy Ghost without scruple to goe seast againe, and that either thou art baptized, or els that certainly thou hast noe neede of it. For as wee say to the papists tou|ching there <HI>traditions,</HI> that seeing we haue life euer|lasting which is all in al <HI>by the worde written,</HI> let them drawe vs neuer so many embo slements, and tel vs ne|uer so many miracles of their traditions, we valewe them al as olde conceiled records, wherein there is neither strength nor power, and the reason is, because we haue sufficient without them: Euen so in this case, so long as wee are assured of the principal, I meane that excellent frute of a justif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ing faith, which is a per|petual peace of conscience in the sonne of God, if any man shal th&eacute; take in hand to bring vs into <HI>a quandare</HI>

Which when I looke vpon, me thinks I shoulde heare <HI>Eliab</HI> speaking in his high voice to his yonger brother <HI>David,</HI> in this or the like manner: <HI>I know thy pride and mallice of thy heart, &amp;c.</HI> Wel let M. <HI>Penri</HI> look to that himselfe, he knows how grieuously God hath visited that sinne in others, and therefore at his perill be it.

My <HI>minor</HI> you see is manifest by the daily practise of our Church, in admitting such to the Lords table, as haue none other baptism then that of women, and that I am sure M. <HI>Some</HI> will confesse to be none: Neither is there, nor neuer was since her ma|jesties raigne, anye tryall or examination had of the matter, nor any article, injunction, or commandement so to enquire, no nor any Homily, or other private or publike admonition that euer I heard of, to charge men to examine themselues in that point, whether they haue true baptism or no, but as if it were a thing nothing materiall, they are (as wee see) without fur|ther scruple receiued to the Lords table in peace. And the like is of those that are our ministers &amp; preachers of the gospell, as well Bb. as others. For among al the Bb. articles, and vrgings to subscription, was there e|ver any stay made I pray you, in the admission of any to that publike function of the ministerie onely vpon

that point, whether they were baptized by women or no? I thinke not, and yet it may be that manye of them haue had none other baptisme then that: O but you will saye that was not knowne, and at the time of their admission, it was supposed they were sufficiently baptized: But I say againe, if the matter be so mate|riall, as M. <HI>Some</HI> would haue it, that ought especially to haue bene knowne, and no hande giuen to their al|lowance, before it had bene perfectly knowne. And if we should stay till then, I thinke it would go neere to craze the license of some of the graundfathers, and make a foule scoure amongest th'oldest of our prea|chers: And so peraduenture, father Iohn Elmar should <HI>kisse Cate</HI> no more in the pulpit while he liued, and what a shrewd losse were that?

Bridges</HI> his) and that all this while she ne|uer called this matter in question, but admitteth both to the Communion, and to the publik teaching in the Church, such as haue bin onely baptized by women, and neuer stoppeth nor stayeth at it, nor maketh any enquirie after it. I conclude I say (for so it must needs fall out) that M. <HI>Some</HI> was greatly ouerseene, thus in a kinde of singularitie to controlle his betters without cause: What? I beleeue we shall haue one of these pu|ritanes of him shortly, for they are alwayes taking ex|ceptions to something or other in Churche or state. No more of that I woulde advise him if hee loue his health or his wealth either, for those fellowes be so elvish, that they had rather begge then haue two be|nefices.</P>
<P>Now for farther confirmation and authorising of
<PB N="66" REF="36">
this practise of our Church, because M. <HI>Some</HI> seemeth to carrie so reverent a minde to his superiors, that he will submit himselfe and all his writings to their cen|sure, I will here, to cut of al cauils, set down the judg|ment of one of the grauest Prelates of the land, con|cerning that point of womens baptisme: For these (as I am informed) are my L. of Winchesters owne words with his graue preamble and all, and I thinke himselfe will not denie them.</P>
<P><HI>Although I be perswaded that the most obiestions made by some persons against the booke of commen prayer are in trueth of no waight, but rather captious &amp; vnpro|fitable as concerning the Church of England, in publike prayer and the vse of the Sacraments to maintaine those things that be directly against the worde of God, yet for the quieting &amp; better directing of some moderate minds which by occasion haue bin drawn into some scruple about these things, I haue layed downe mine opinion about the true interpretation of the same in this wise: First as tou|ching the baptisme by Midwiues, I can assure you that the Church of England, or any that I knowe in place of gouer|ment therein, doth not maintaine either the baptisme of midwiues as a thing tollerable in the Church, or else the condemnation of those children that depart this worlde vnbaptized, but doth accounte them both eronius &amp; not according to the word of God. For in the Conuocation the matter was debated amongst vs wherin some of those per|sons were present, to whome the drawing of the booke was committed, whoe protested that neither the order of the booke did alowe any such thing, neither that it was any part of their meaning to approue the same: But for soe much as baptizing by women, hath bin a sore time com|monly vsed and nowe also of rashnesse by some is done, the booke only taketh order &amp; prouideth, that if the childe be baptized by the midwife rebaptizing be not admitted.
<PB N="67" REF="36">
For when it is done according to the forme of the questi|ons set downe in the booke, if it shoulde be condemned as</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">My Lord of vvinchesters judgement touching those that are baptized by Mid|vviues.</NOTE> <HI>no baptisme, it would in th'opinion of many learned draw some error of doctrine, and inferre greater inconuenience then in any Church may be borne, that is an infinite num|ber which neuer had other baptisme, should nowe be re|baptized, and all those of yeares of discretion that were dead and were onely so baptised, depart without the seale of Gods promise in the Sacrament. The learned doe right wel knowe, how the primitiue Church and the learned fa|thers that liued therein, shunned rebaptization, though the former baptisme were ministred either by lay persons or children: Therefore the booke prouiding only for the remedy thereof ought not to be condemned.</HI> Thus far my good L. of Winchester: The summe whereof is this: <HI>That the booke of common praier condemneth the baptis|me of midwiues, and yet admitteth no other baptisme for feare of rebaptization:</HI> And why then should her Ma|iestie be brought back againe to baptisme, when such as in our owne judgments, were neuer baptized in deede, are notwithstanding let alone, without any farther addition, or supply of the sacrament, and yet (as I saide before) not barred from the communion for all that?</P>
<P>Therefore presuppose nowe a man should tell M. <HI>Some</HI> plainly, that in the popish Church there is noe true baptisme, what would he inferre vpon that? mar|ry that many thousands are at this day vnbaptised, &amp; what then? Whie then they ought to be brought back againe to baptisme: Nay soft, by his fauor I deny that, for that you see is flatly ouerthrown by the judgment and practise of the Church of England, and therefore it becommeth both M. <HI>Some</HI> and me, to sit downe by it with reuerence. So that if my L. of Cant. shoulde nowe be baptized by a woman, (as being so long agoe
<PB N="68" REF="37">
who dare take his oath to the contary; And my L. of <HI>Winchester</HI> by a popish shaueling, what reason is it that my L. of <HI>Winchester</HI> should be washed a newe, seeing it is a ruled case that my L. of Cant. must not? And yet it may be for the true substance of <HI>Baptisme,</HI> they may well goe together in one ballance, and ne|uer a barrel better hearring.</P>
<P>But it may be you will altogether condemne this poore judgment of the Bishops, as manifestly bewrai|ing very grosse &amp; palpable ignorance, wherin though I should not dissent from you, yet in as much as he is in place of on of the graue Patriarches of our church, there is noe reason, but that his very credite &amp; coun|tenance (if there were nothing els) should in this case be sufficient to crushe in peeces a better mans judge|ment then M. <HI>Somes:</HI> Beside that he is one of our <HI>or|dinaries</HI> you knowe, and the statute saieth (as I take it) that in matter of doubt or scruple, we must alwaies relie vpon the sence and interpretation of our ordina|ry, howsoeuer it be, I hope you wil beare me witnesse, that by this meanes both my propositions are as sub|stantially proued as a man would wish, the deane of <HI>Sarum</HI> being author of th'one, and my L. of <HI>Winche|ster</HI> in a sort confirming th'other. And this I tell you before hand, (therefore looke to it and say you had warning) that if I catche M. <HI>Some</HI> once in that veine, that he wil make no boanes to reiect, and set light by such men as these, (th'one a deane, th'other a Bishop and both pillers of our Church) I will certainly in my next letter giue M. <HI>Penri</HI> leaue to deny <HI>Caluin,</HI> if he haue but the bare trueth on his side, and you cannot say nowe, but you haue had warning, wherein yet by your fauor, your D. case must needs be the harder, in that he cannot wel denie any of these reuerent men, but he must withal be forced <HI>inclusiue</HI> to giue a foule

the record, that the absurdities were neuer worth tal|king of since, therefore the onely shift for your D. is, to get them passe by parliament if he can, for other|wise to take them to be such vppon his bare worde, he must pardon vs for that, for if he were Archb. of Cant.

directed, and peraduenture more toe, by the reason of some distemperature that makes him forget himself, yea and for our better satisfaction, he tels vs and that very often, that <HI>he doth rest in that which he hath writ|ten,</HI> dreaming belike, that because himselfe hath some good liking of his own Image, therefore others must needs haue so to. But howe if this test be a broken rest? or howe if D. <HI>Bridges</HI> and D. <HI>Bancroft</HI> should also tel vs, that they likewise for their parts, <HI>do rest in that which they haue written?</HI> Yet M. <HI>Some</HI> knowes that hee <NOTE PLACE="marg">183</NOTE> must needs be a very restie Iade, that for all this rest|ing of theirs, would rest or relie vpon any such frippe|rie ware as they haue cumbred the Church with. But is it not a shrewd wipe to feareful and ignorant men, when a man of that aunciencie as M. <HI>Some</HI> is, shall reach at vs with a weapon drawn from the experience of his owne learning and judgment? in this manner: <HI>If I haue any learning, you doe</HI> toto caelo errare: It is something I confes, and yet if our <HI>brother Bridges</HI> had <NOTE PLACE="marg">73</NOTE> so come vppon vs, we should haue done well enough with him, we could quickly haue added this <HI>Minor</HI> to his <HI>Maior: But Heuen and earth knoweth brother Brid|ges, that you haue no learning, &amp; are but a sol&punc; ergo,</HI> mary to M. <HI>Some</HI> the case goeth harder with vs, and there|fore he that woulde nowe be resolued in the point, <HI>whether dumbe ministers be ministers or no,</HI> neede noe more but ride to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to know whether M. <HI>Some</HI> be learned, &amp; if he finde him to be so, then to make no question but that they be ministers in deed, <HI>quod sub|stantiam</HI> but not <HI>quoad qualitatem.</HI> Neuerthelesse be|cause learned men haue their slipps somtimes, and are not so priuiledged, but that in their heate or height of spirit, they may nowe and then let fall absurdities as wel as others, therefore we are in noe greate feare of this neither, the rather because your D. leaueth

vs certain pretty outrules (I dare not say absurdities) vncanceled of purpose as I thinke, to try whether his aduersarie be spu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">blinde or noe: For what els shoulde this meane? <HI>If you denie not that it is a Sacrament you affirme it: For not to denie is to affirme: Every childe</HI> (saith M. D.) <HI>can teach you that lesson:</HI> And I promise you then it is a proper lesson, but if a childe can so re|dily <NOTE PLACE="marg">140</NOTE> teach it, I trust an elder man may as readily learn it. See then what a wit I haue, that can at the first dash vpon the sight of one bare paterne, thwite you out an other straight, full as good as that: M. <HI>Some denies not that I am a bastard, Ergo he affirmes it. For not to denie is to affirme. Euery childe can teache him that.</HI> Ye howe nowe? What occasion did I giue M. <HI>Some</HI> to call me bastard? Trust me if he vse me so, ile haue an action of the case against him: For I would he should knowe it, my mother is an honest gentlewoman, &amp; nobly borne: And thus you see, of words may grow blowes. Wel for al that, if I wist your D. were in good earnest, I would certainly get M. <HI>Penri</HI> to wright on his head as an ab|surditie, and a childish absurditie to by his leaue, with out either reson or sense: for what co~seque~ce is there I pray you in these, M. <HI>Some</HI> denies not that his brother <HI>Bridges</HI> is a patch, Ergo he affirmes it: M. <HI>Some</HI> denies not that the calling of an Archb. is vnlawfull, Ergo he affirmes it: For not to denie is to affirme? He that had a good commission to reason thus at his pleasure, might peradventure mooue your D. patience vnrea|sonably, and make the couler come in his face: For so a man might be convinced to affirm a thousand things that he neuer so much as dreamed of, because it can|not be prooued that euer he denied them.</P>
<P>O but you will saye peraduenture, that M. <HI>Some</HI> meanes this onely of those thinges that are in questi|on and debate, and not of euery thing at randome: As
<PB N="73" REF="39">
if there be a controuersy about <HI>Predestination,</HI> he that in handling of this denies it not, may truely in a sort, be said to affirme it: And so now the controuersie be|ing about the Sacrament from popish priests, and M. <HI>Penri</HI> not denying it, may truely in like sort be said to affirm it. And then by that reckoning there is no dou|ting of any thing. For if a man doubt of a thing, and denie it not, he affirmes it straight. And is this trowe you th'evidence that M. <HI>Some</HI> will plead for himselfe in this case? Now sure then hath he firmed faire: And what may the good Deane of <HI>Sarum</HI> saye to this, but that he was borne in an vnfortunate houre, to be by this proper distinction manifestly convinced as a trai|tor, euen by the mouth of my L. of Winchester him|selfe, if it were he that fumbled vs vp that sodden <HI>Ad|monition to the people of England?</HI> For <HI>Martin</HI> (whom he cals the libeller) chargeth D. <HI>Bridges</HI> with flat trea|son, and I take it, he names both the place &amp; the page: Now comes father <HI>Admonitor,</HI> and he worthely de|fends, but what? marie forsoth, for want of other mat|ter. <HI>That ministers liuings should not be take~ from them, and be employed he knowes not howe.</HI> But the principall thing in controversie, namely the treason charged so justly vpon D. <HI>Bridges</HI> his head, he had no leisure to peruse, though he could finde leisure to speake of him twice or thrice and that purposely in his praise. The issue therefore is, that seeing the thing was in contro|versie, yea and the principall and most materiall thing of all the controuersie: and my L. of Winchester ha|uing the matter in hand, doth not nor dare not (it see|meth) denie it. Then out of M. <HI>Somes</HI> Logicke or di|uinitie (chuse you whether) I conclude vn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">oydablie, that he must needs affirme it: <HI>For not to denie, is to af|firme, Euery childe can teach him that.</HI> Ergo M. <HI>Bridges</HI> (I am sory for him good soule) must needes be a tray|tor
<PB N="74" REF="40">
by my L. of Winchesters verdict. And I woulde I might liue to see him, eyther to fall out with M. <HI>Some</HI> for this kinde of reasoning, or els to trie his action of the case against the Bishop.</P>
<P>Likewise where M. <HI>Penri</HI> sayth, that those that re|ceiue the Co~munion at the hands of dumb &amp; vnprea|ching ministers, doe in a sort approue their sinne. will you see how pretily your D. refutes it with an inflance of Iudas in this sort. <HI>The Apostles</HI> (saith he) <HI>receiued the Lordes supper with Iudas, but did not approoue the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">120</NOTE> <HI>theft and treason of Iudas, &amp;c.</HI> How say you? would you not think he were in jest? &amp; speak your co~science, was not this right from the corner of the staffe and to very good purpose, the controversie being of recey|uing the Sacraments at the hands of dumb ministers? Why alasse, we suppose that Christe our Sauiour was no dumb minister, at whose hands the Apostles recei|ued it: What haue we then to doe with Iudas in this case, vnlesse he had bene minister of it? In deed if the question had bene <HI>Whether one may without pollution, communicate in the companie of the wicked,</HI> then this example of Iudas, had bin a just laste for that foote: the speech being of the minister that shoulde deliuer it, we may truely vse M. <HI>Somes</HI> owne wordes against himselfe, and tell him by his patience, that it was euen as neere as Yorke and London.</P>
<P>An other of his pretty outrules is this: <HI>It is consess|ed</HI> (saith he) <HI>of all famous and learned men, that Gods Church is not necessarily tied in al places &amp; times to one sorme in th'external calling of the ministers,</HI> wherein I con him thanke yet, that he hath learned so much dis|cretion as to name non though he speake of all. And therefore if a man should giue them al the <HI>lye,</HI> it were not a point matter, for the disgrace can light one noe man where noe man is named. But for the matter it
<PB N="75" REF="40">
selfe (if he speake it of an established church, we feare not to tel him that th'assertion is manifestly false and vnttue, we graunt in deede that at the first plantinge of a Church, when men are newly transformed (as it were) from paganisme to christianitie the Lord wor|keth extraordinarily, &amp; that in those cases there can|not wel be traced out any certaine prescript rules of direction: But in a settled and established Church it is far otherwise: There we say that the Church is ne|cessarily tied in al places to one essential forme in the external calling of the ministers: I say <HI>essential forme,</HI> to cut of al cauels and wranglings about any circum|stance or ceremontal custome: As if in one Church the calling and election should goe by lifting vp the hand. In an other by throwing vp of capps, in an other by Scrutiny or voices, in an other by one custome, in an other by an other: This seueral guise and fashion of seueral Churches in their elections hindreth noe whit, but that the essential forme remaineth still one, and the same in them al. And if you aske me what that <HI>essential forme</HI> should be, I answere, <HI>The godly and christian fore deliberation, trial, and allowance of the Church &amp; elders, with the assent and approbation of the people:</HI> This I say is that essential forme, whereunto al churches in al ages (speking of an established church) are so necessarilie tied in regarde of Gods ordinance, as it is vtterly vnlawfull by any meanes to violate or infringe the same. And this we suppose a meaner man then M. <HI>Penri</HI> neede not be afraide to defend against 10. D. <HI>Somes,</HI> or any nonresident in Christendome, ne|ther can we be perswaded that among al those <HI>famous learned men</HI> he speaks of, there was euer any godlye sinceare professor of the Gospel that did denie it: And even much after this manner, and ful as learnedly as this doth he handle himselfe within 2. pages of the
<PB N="76" REF="41">
same place, where after he hath gathered his aduer|saries argument thus. <HI>All may be capable of the out|warde allowaunce:</HI> Ergo. <HI>th'outwarde calling of the Church maks not a minister to vs vnlesse he haue the in|warde,</HI> he tels him that <HI>his Antecedent is a speciall one.</HI> And what is his reason? Marke I pray you, and giue care for your learning, and then tell me whether an olde D. may not forgett as fast in London, as euer he learned in Cambridge: <HI>I trust</HI> (saith he) <HI>you doe not condemne a prescript Liturgie in the Church of God. If you doe al the reformed Churches dissent from you.</HI> Howe thinke you was not his head smitten with a <HI>Lethargie</HI> that spied nowe a time to speake of a <HI>Liturgie,</HI> when in a manner he had as just occasion to speake of the Moone. In like sort it is worth marking, what a pro|per construction he makes of this worde <HI>Ministerie, By Ministerie</HI> (saith he) <HI>I vnderstand the reading of the holy scriptures, the deliuering of the publike prayers, th'administration of the sacraments:</HI> That is even as much to say in good english, as by the horse I vnder|stand the saddle, or rather by the tree, I vnderstande the apple of the tree, or <HI>by Ministerie I vnderstande that which is not indeede the Ministerie, but the execu|tion of the Ministerie.</HI> And cannot M. <HI>Some</HI> see a sen|sible difference betwixt these 2.? Or is he nowe to learne, that there may be a tree that neuer had apple, and that a man may haue a lawful <HI>ministerie</HI> commit|ted vnto him, and yet neuer come to anye of these, because he may either dye or by occasion be recalled or depriued by the Church before.</P>
<P>Yet among al his outrules I doe not thinke that his penne hath more squared in any one thing, then in this, that he chargeth his aduersarie to say flatlye, and yet it is but a <HI>Flat lye</HI> Neither: <HI>that the want of a Sermon maketh th'action frustrate, that is, the sacrament
<PB N="77" REF="41">
to be no sacrrment, and that a Sermon is simply of th'es|sence</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">97</NOTE> <HI>of a sacrament. &amp;c.</HI> vppon which Imagination or rather dreame of his owne braine, he keepeth greate a doe after his manner, making it one of his solemne chapters to prooue vnto vs forsooth, that midnight is not high none, but if the words (as he hath set them downe) be not to be found in all that euer M. <HI>Penri</HI> hath published, me thinks <HI>M. Some</HI> should be striken with some remorse, especially when he remembreth that <HI>A lying tongue slaieth the soule,</HI> and a false witnes pulleth shame and confusion vppon himselfe. But it may be you wil say that though the very words be not there, yet the same very sence must of necessitie be ga|thered out of that which M. <HI>Penri</HI> hath written: For doth he not say I pray you, that <HI>the substantial forme of consecration, is conteined in the exposition of the holy institution, and th'inuocation of the name of God, all which are necessarily required in th'administration of the sacrrmente?</HI> Most true he saith so in deed: I se noe danger why he may not say so againe: for what is there here (if it be rightly examined) that is either blasphe|mous or injurious to the holy saith that we professe? First he saith not here (if you marke it) that, <HI>that the substantial forme or essence of the Sacrament</HI> consisteth in th'exposition or inuocation, &amp;c. but that <HI>the substa~|tiall forme of Consecration,</HI> as if he should say, <HI>there is no true consecration, no substantiall forme of blessing and hallowing of the Sacrament, without exposition of the word, and invocation of the name of God:</HI> Which I take to be very sound and inviolable, and therein I referre me to the learned. Nowe whether the elements deli|uered be a sacrament without this Consecration, that is, without the opening of the word, &amp; calling on the name of God, that is another question: Albeit I doe not read in the whole Scripture, that there was euer
<PB N="78" REF="42">
any sacrament administred without one of these. And if a man should tell M. <HI>Some,</HI> that <HI>Where there is ney|ther of these,</HI> that is, <HI>that where there is neyther breaking of the word, nor invocation of the name of God, there is no Sacrament at all:</HI> I thinke this might well inough be just<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">fied. And I would faine knowe of M. <HI>Some</HI> for my lerning, if a minister lawfully called, should rude|ly and abruptly come into the congregation, and step|ping straight to the Communion table, should with|out more adoe, deliuer the elementes to the people, onely with these bare wordes: <HI>Take, eate, this is my bodie, &amp;c.</HI> If he should I saye, so far forget himselfe, as neither to vse prayer nor exposition of the word at al in that action: Whether this were a sacrament or no, I suppose nor. For what is the thing that doth sanctifie the elementes, consecrate and seperate them to that holy vse, but onely <HI>The worde and prayer.</HI> Take away that, and then are they you knowe, but in the case of our common and ordinary sustenaunce. And M. <HI>Some</HI> himselfe saith in one place, that <HI>The very life of the sa|craments dependeth vpon Gods promises expressed in his</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">119</NOTE> <HI>holy worde.</HI> Now if there be no promise, but where the invocation of Gods name is, the~ it is cleare, that with|out it, the thinges deliuered, are but bare and dead e|lements, because they are not consecrated according ro th'institution. But well you see how M. <HI>Some</HI> doth herein bring his <HI>Ergo</HI> about, to prooue out of his ad|versaties owne words, <HI>That the want of a sermon, doth make the action frustrate.</HI> Then thus it must bee whe|ther he will or no, if he will make any thing of it.</P>
<P><HI>The exposition of the holy institution, and th'invoca|tion of the name of God, is necessarily required in th'ad|ministration of Baptisme.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo, without a sermon, there can be no sacrament.</HI> Which (as I co~ceiue) is a co~sequent much like to this:</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="42">
<HI>The examination and ripping vp of a mans own heart, with the arraignement of his conscience, is necessarily re|quired of every one that will present himself at the Lords table:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo without this examination, he receiuce no Sacrament</HI></P>
<P>The lame legge of both the consequents, lyeth in these words, <HI>necessarily required:</HI> Which if it be taken of that inevitable necessitie, that the want thereof should vtterly destroy the very nature and essence of the thing in question, then indeed it were a good con|sequent: But vnderstanding <HI>necessary</HI> in regard of our obedience to the holy ordinaunce and institution of Christ (the breach whereof, is onely a sinne in the do|er, and no overthrow to the thing done) In this sence I thinke M. <HI>Some</HI> will yeelde, that his braue <HI>Ergo</HI> lim|peth and shrinketh in the sinowes vnreasonably. But what will you say, if the man that you reverence so, be taken now and then with a tricke of a false singer? you would be sory for that I am sure: you do not heare me say, that he can iuggle or help a die, I would not haue you to take me so. My meaning is onely, that he can for need if he be not watched, slily wipe out a worde or two out of the text for his advantage: and another time peradventure, glide me in a worde or two more then hee shoulde, to make th'evidence a little more pleadable. This you know is a falt, but yet such a falt, as you shall perceiue by M. <HI>Some,</HI> that a learned man may falt in sometimes if he be not locked vnto: For where M. <HI>Penri</HI> sayth thus: <HI>We are alreadie receiued into the bosome of the Church, and acknowledged to haue the seale of the Covenant, in asmuch as we were once offe|red and received, &amp;c.</HI> See howe your D. controlleth this, in his third page of his rolle of errors. <HI>If: his be true which</HI> M. <HI>Penri saith, th'outward and bare element deliuered by him, which in his owne judgement is no mi|nister,
<PB N="80" REF="43">
is the seale of Gods covenant: which is a most ab|surd heresie.</HI> Marke here I say a false finger, for how els coulde the poore Welshman haue bene an absurd he|reticke? The pithe of the whole matter lying in this word <HI>Acknowledged,</HI> M. Doctor hath quite left it out: For <HI>M. Penri</HI> doth not say absolutely, <HI>That we haue the seale of the covenant, but we are acknowledged to haue it</HI> And is there not a sensible difference betwixte these two? For it is certaine, that Baptisme of women, ney|ther is not can be in trueth, the seale of Gods cove|naunt: but yet you see (as I haue prooued to you be|fore) both by the practize of our Churche, and by the interpretation of my L. of Winchester, that it is plain|ly acknowledged amongest vs for the seale of Gods covenant, otherwise it shoulde neuer passe as it doth amongest vs without any interruption, questioning, controllment, or enquirie. If then there be a plam dif|ference betwixt having, and acknowledged to have, then I pray you do you so much as devise some honest meanes to salue this false finger, for I promise you I cannot.</P>
<P>Furthermore in that point of the <HI>magistracy</HI> (which M. <HI>Penri</HI> is soe charged to haue handled with very foule and bepitched hands) the very words which M. <HI>Doctor</HI> would seeme most to make vantage of. vz. <HI>de|uise of man.</HI> I cannot finde in al M. <HI>Penries</HI> booke, sure I am, they be not to the places quoted, betwixt the pa|ges. 47. and 51. And if they be not in the booke at all (as I beleue they be not) the~ by your leaue we charge him once more with a trick of a false singer, in that he hath thrust in more then was in the text. Nowe if you tell me that though the words be not there, yet they are necessarily gathered out of the sence, then I choke him againe with M. D. owne sentence, <HI>Non scriptura sed sensus scripturae est heresis,</HI> it is not M. <HI>penries</HI> words
<PB N="81" REF="43">
but M. <HI>Somes</HI> glosse and collection vpon the woords, that makes this absurd heresie: But your D. granting that S. <HI>Peter</HI> doth indeede call magistracie <HI>A bnmane ordinance,</HI> doeth withal assure vs that th'Apostle did not thereby meane <HI>that Magistracie was ordeined and deuised by man:</HI> It may be he looks for thanks for this, which though of curtesie we may yeld him, yet you may tel him that our ignorance is noe more releeued by this, then it is by a hundred thinges more in his booke, which we knew before, marry he tels vs with|all: <HI>That it is not th'Apostles words but the sence that</HI> M. <HI>Penry giues them, that is Anabaptistical,</HI> in deede we thanke him for this, it is some more good manner <NOTE PLACE="marg">137</NOTE> yet, then is in olde <HI>Lockwoode of Sarum,</HI> for if he had the matter in handeling, there had bene some danger that th'Apostle woulde haue prooued an <HI>Anabaptist:</HI> Wel nowe th'Apostle hath obteined that fauor to be cleared, howe shal wee doe to cleare M. <HI>Penri,</HI> whose sence vppon the words M. <HI>Some</HI> will needs haue to be <HI>Anabaptistical?</HI> First in that he doth neuer say so, but rather the contrary as M. <HI>Some</HI> himselfe acknoledg|eth in these words, <HI>you confesse in this place that Ma|gistracie</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">136</NOTE> <HI>is th'ordinance of God,</HI> me thinks in equitye this should be a reasonable clearing to him: Nay I say farther that as he he hath noe such words, so there can be no such sence gathered out of his words with|out violence: In deede if your D. had put but one. <HI>A.</HI> before, then I would haue taken his parte that such a sense might very well haue bene gathered of that which M. <HI>Penri</HI> sets downe: As when he speaks of <HI>Cin|cinatus, Tarquinius, Opinius, Candaules, Gracchus</HI> and the rest: A man with halfe an eie may easily see that he speaks not indefinitely of <HI>Magistracie,</HI> but of a <HI>Ma|gistracie</HI> in such an age, and such a time, which his owne very words doe so cleare, as thereby mallice it
<PB N="82" REF="44">
selfe may blush and be silent: <HI>There may</HI> (saith he) <HI>be</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">47 48</NOTE> <HI>a lawful Magistracie according to the word, whose name &amp; office was neuer heard of before in the worlde, so can there not be a Ministery. &amp;c.</HI> here you see plainly hee speaks not of <HI>Magistracie</HI> indefinitely, but of <HI>A Magi|stracie:</HI> As for example, if her Maiestie should erecte nowe a newe kinde of gouerment either at <HI>Windesore</HI> or at <HI>Kingston</HI> vppon Thames, (as by her pretogatiue shee may doe if she list,) and cal th'one of them, <HI>The Tribunes of Windesore,</HI> and th'other <HI>The Consulls of Kingston:</HI> This k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nde of magistracie in that it was ne|uer knowne nor hearde of before, may truly without any blemish to the honor of God, be called <HI>A deuise of man,</HI> and yet <HI>Magistracie</HI> in general and indefinite|ly vnderstood, the very immediate ordinance of God prescribed in the word: and this me thinks is so plaine as I cannot beleeue that olde D. <HI>Stumbler</HI> himselfe, I meane the Prince of all the <HI>Stumblers</HI> in the worlde, vz. Sir Iohn of <HI>Sarum</HI> would euer stumble at it. Ther|fore if in wringing this sence out of his aduersaries words flat contrary to the drift and intent of the wri|ter, he did willingly and of purpose leaue out <HI>A</HI> set|ting downe <HI>Magistracie</HI> indefinitely, in lew of <HI>A Ma|stracie,</HI> wee must be so bolde by his leaue, to charge it vpon his head with the rest, as a tricke of <HI>a false finger</HI> wheresoeuer he learned it.</P>
<P>An other thing there is in this chapter of M. <HI>Somes</HI> that for mine owne part I can conceiue noe sence of, namely this: <HI>That Magistracy is an ecclesiastical consti|tution:</HI> this I confesse is a mistery to me, and soundes more harsh in mine eares a greate deale, then that which M. <HI>Penri</HI> is charged with, vz. <HI>Deuise of man,</HI> which may in a sorte you see be justified, and there|fore I would ride a good way I tell you, to heare this matter soundly and substantially prooued: I heare in|deede
<PB N="83" REF="44">
a heauy sentence, pronounced on all those that shall dare to denie it to be an <HI>Ecclesiastical constitutio~, vz. That is a very grosse &amp; Anbaptistical error,</HI> but this doeth neither fright vs nor satisfie vs: For hauing sene a number of the like thunderclapps before, and little raine falling after them, but onely a bare ratling in the air, we haue certainly determined with our selues that they shall neuer fright vs more if there come a hundreth of them, in the meane time if you aske mee what I thinke of <HI>Magistracie,</HI> I answere freely: <HI>That it is the holy ordinance of God prescribed in the worde, for th'vse and comfort of man, &amp; is therefore called of the Apostle, a humane ordinance, in that his proper obiect &amp; office is to deale in humane things:</HI> And will not all this serue to cleare a man from Anabaptistrie, but he must confesse withal, that it is an Ecclesiasticall constituti|on? This goeth hard, to binde vs to entertaine a stran|ger vpon so small acquaintance: Good intreat your D. to resolue vs and instruct vs first, &amp; then vpon our contumacie if neede be, to proceed to sentence, and so to pronounce vs Anabaptists. In other needles points I reme~ber your D. is but to vnreasonable ful of his au|thorities, <HI>Calvin, Beza, P. Martyr, Famous Churches,</HI> &amp; I know not who, in somuch that sometimes he leaues no roome almost either for grounded reason, or scrip|ture, there is such a presse of them: yea, and in one place he tels M. <HI>Penri</HI> and that aloude, <HI>All the learned agree with me, and dissent from you:</HI> And will all these his learned friends forsake him now trow ye, when he hath most need of them? Surely I beleeue they will if they be well examined: For I do not thinke that he can for his life bring out that man, if he be worth whi|steling, I meane any good, sound, and learned author, either olde or new, that he may honestly muster with himselfe in this point, to call Magistracie (as he doth)
<PB N="84" REF="45">
by the name of Ecclesiasticall constitution: There|fore as he saith by <HI>M. Penri,</HI> so we thinke we may just|ly say by him, that in this case he may worthely walke iole by iole with <HI>H. N.</HI> indeed. But his proofes if you mark them, are even as pregnant as the matter it self. I must needs say they be sure onsal, for they are fetched out of the scripture the most of them, as you may see by these: <HI>By me kings raigne</HI> (saith he) Prouerb. 8. <HI>Thou couldest haue no power at al against mee, vnlesse it were giuen thee from aboue,</HI> saith Christ our Sauiour to Pi|late, <HI>Iohn. 19. There is no power but of God, whosoeuer therefore resisteth power, resisteth the ordinance of God, Rom.</HI> 13. more he laieth downe an other reason drawn from the reuerence that is imprinted by almightye God in the harts of subiects, <HI>At quorsum haec?</HI> matty to prooue vnto vs (as I coniecture that <HI>Douer Castle</HI> stands where it did the last yeare,) or els as M. <HI>Some</HI> saith, that <HI>midnight is not high noone:</HI> By this you may <NOTE PLACE="marg">187</NOTE> see that when a naile is knocked fast in a wheele, turne the wheele neuer so many times about, the naile will be stil where it was: Even so it is in this case with M. <HI>Some,</HI> he turnes and turnes, and it may be sweates in turning, and yet when he hath don, he leaues the naile sticking where it was: For what hath he woon I pray you by al this? Forsooth <HI>That Magistracie is the ordi|nance of God:</HI> And where is that <HI>Muscouite</HI> that doth donie it? <HI>Proude Penri</HI> you see doth grant it, <HI>The Scis|matical Catabaptist</HI> doth graunt it, he that hath bre|ched so mary <HI>popish, blasphemous, &amp; Anabaptisticall fansies,</HI> this man doth graunt it by M. <HI>Somes</HI> owne confession: And could he then be so jellous to suspect any man els? Nowe sure your D. hath a maruelous suspitious head, wel for his farther satisfaction, and to ease him of som paines hereafter, I wil here giue him my fre warrant vnder my hand to cry <HI>Crusisige</HI> against
<PB N="85" REF="45">
him that should denie it, and therefore let him neuer drawe weapon more in the defence of that assertion. <HI>that Magistracie is the ordinance of God prescribed in the worde,</HI> for it yeelded him without blowes: But in the meane season, what is become of <HI>Ecclesiastical con|stitution?</HI> I heare nothing of that gentlewoman al this while: Is shee fled ouer with the Iesuites? If shee be, it were good to fetch her againe by proclamation, lest she die in exile: For I can tell you this proper <HI>Enthi|mem</HI> will neuer fetch her againe while the worlde stands: <HI>It is an ordinance of God prescribed in the word,</HI> Ergo. <HI>it is an ecclesiasticall constitution.</HI> This I say will be founde to weake though all the Doct. of <HI>Sorbona</HI> shoulde set their hands to it: For is there not a flatte opposition betwixt <HI>Ciuill</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastical;</HI> I take it there is, and I am sure I haue heard learned men say so. And is not <HI>Ciuil iurisdiction</HI> an ordinance of God pre|scribed in the word? me thinks it should, why then by this newe founde consequent, we shall haue short lye a newe vniuersitie nosgay, vz. <HI>that ciuil iurisdiction is an Ecclesiastical constitution,</HI> and that were good time but small reason: Euen so <HI>Warre, Phisicke, The inhe|ritance of men,</HI> and a number of things more would be found to be Ecclesiasticall constitutions, because they are all the ordinance of God prescribed in the worde. And if this will not hold water, then I dare avow your D. hath not any thing els, in that his 13. chapter more then his bare word (which we are now glutted with) to warrant that outlandish assertion of his: <HI>That Ma|gistracie is an Ecclesiasticall constitution, &amp;c.</HI> Moreo|uer, if in speaking of the ministery of the New Testa|ment, that be a true proposition, that <HI>Sola ecclesia vo|cat, The Church onely calleth,</HI> as I haue heard it aveared by learned men, that the Lord doth not now call any more extraordinarily from heuen as in times past, but
<PB N="86" REF="46">
hath left that to be done <HI>Per suffragia ecclesiae tantum,</HI> onely by the voyce and allowance of the Church: if I say this be sounde, and will abide the fire (as I verily thinke it will) then marke what I saye to you: if your D. with al his lerning, be not taken in as foule, grosse, and more palpable absurditie then ever th'ignoraunt Welshman was, ile loose my credit, and that were pi|tie you know, that so proper a man as I shoulde loose his credite.

<P>Will you haue it in English now? For ile neuer dis|semble you, I doe by my Latine, as that sweet babe of <HI>Sarum</HI> doth by his greeke and Hebrue, begg and bor|row here a patch, and there a patch, as the Dictiona|ries that come in my way do yeeld me sustenance. And if any thing hapen to be false, then it was either <HI>Chard</HI> my printers fault, or else my Dictionarie was not of the last edition, or els my candle wanted snuffing. But let me not forget my argument I pray you, for it may be I take a pride in it: Then I say,</P>
<P><HI>Where there is no Church, there there is no calling,</HI> for <HI>Sola Ecclesia vocat:</HI> Otherwise, the Churches prero|gative in this case, shoulde not be aboue the heathen and vnbeleeuers, if it were in them to call both alike: (take me I pray you, that I speake still of the ministe|ry of the New Testament or els you offer me wrong) In that case I say, it is the Churches only to call. And therin I appeal to the flowre of your own vniuersitier I do not mean D. <HI>Copquot,</HI> for we count him but of the middle sort, as we set D. <HI>Bridges</HI> and D. <HI>Pearne</HI> in the
<PB N="87" REF="46">
seuenteenth fourme behind him: No I meane the ve|ry ornaments of your Vniversitie in deed, whose very names and liues doe cary with them an estimation to be reverenced: D. <HI>Fulke,</HI> D. <HI>Goad,</HI> D. <HI>Whytaker,</HI> &amp; M. <HI>Chaterton:</HI> To these men I saye I appeale, to speake their consciences herein, euen <HI>Coram tribunali,</HI> whe|ther it be not a firme trueth, <HI>That there is no calling out of the Church:</HI> Speaking of the ministerie of the New Testament. That then being set downe as a brazen wall, I go on in the face of the enemie with my target in my hand in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Where there is no calling, there there can be no mini|sterie,</HI> Ile never stande to prooue that for shame: For he is worthier of a censurer (as M. <HI>Some</HI> sayth) then a refuter that will deny that. And last of all</P>
<P><HI>Where there is no ministerie, there there can be no Sa|crament.</HI> For <HI>Nullum sacramentum sine Ministro.</HI> This M. <HI>Some</HI> himselfe confesseth eyther twice or thrice, &amp; calls it a rule in divinitie.</P>
<P>The conclusion therfore is: <HI>That there can be no Sa|crament out of the Church,</HI> and then say I M. <HI>Some</HI> is be|raied, who houlds <HI>that true baptisme is and may be out of the Church,</HI> wherein it is no more possible for him to escape an absurditie, then it was for <HI>Campion</HI> to e|scape hanging. And howe say you nowe? Had it not bin prety that my Logick should haue died in a ditch? Wel in good sadnesse for al that, alow me but my first proposition to be true (as I hope you wil) <HI>that there is noe calling into the Ministerie but only of the Church,</HI> &amp; then good leaue haue you to bringe vpon me a thou|sand <HI>Augustines, Calvines,</HI> or <HI>Bozaes,</HI> or all the famous churches in the worlde, I say in reuerence to them all, <HI>Instar mille veritatis calculus,</HI> yet M. <HI>Some</HI> yeelds that <HI>Cyprian</HI> was of that judgment, and then wee dare be bolde to say that he was in that point of a true judg|ment
<PB N="88" REF="47">
against them all: For I haue heard baptisme de|fined to be an action of the whole Church, that the whole congregation hath an interest in that Sacra|ment: And if it be so, if it be th'action of the church, howe can it be where there is noe Church? Further|more M. <HI>Some</HI> himselfe calls it <HI>an entrance into the vi|sible Church, an engrasting into the true Christ,</HI> al which howe it may stand, and yet be out of the Church, (I confesse mine owne ignorannce) I see neither sequell nor possibilitie: As to that which is inferred in this case of <HI>Heretikes, of Caiphas, of Iudas,</HI> and such like, I take it vnder correction to be quite beside the cushen, for as I knowe that the wretchednesse and treachery of <HI>Iudas,</HI> coulde not overthrowe his caling and Mi|nistery, being the very same that <HI>Peters</HI> was: So doe I also know, that no holinesse or godlinesse of any man whatsoeuer, (if he be blinde or dumbe) can approoue his caling into the ministery: And therevppon I re|porte me to you, whether this conclusion haue not a wry mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Iudas, Cayphas, heretikes and such vile wretches, may haue (for all their lewdnes) a lawfull ministerie, and so deliuer a sacrament:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo popish priests and dumbe ministers (for all their ignorance and inabillitie to teach) may haue and doe the lyke.</HI></P>
<P>Me thinks this argument smells as if it were shaped at Salisbury, I cannot tel, but I am greatly deceiued if I haue not seene M. D. <HI>Bridges</HI> ride on such a lame Iade in my daies. Therefore aduise your D. to beware of these curtailes and hacknies of <HI>Sarum,</HI> that wil stu~|ble vnreasonably and tyre at every to. miles ryding, wee knowe it right well and wee knewe it before M. <HI>Some</HI> wrote that the case may be so, that an heretike may deliuet true <HI>Baptisme:</HI> And if <HI>Ciprian</HI> were abso|lutely
<PB N="89" REF="47">
of a coutrary judgment to this, wee holde with M. <HI>Some</HI> he was wide. But what is this to those on whome it is not possible to fasten any such callinge into the ministery, because they are as I may say, of an vncapable nature, <HI>as Infants, dumb men, blinde men, &amp;c</HI> And (as Mast. <HI>Penri</HI> will needes haue it) men without gifts? For what a kind of refuting call you this? you holde that men without gifts can haue no calling of the Church: I proue yes, and howe? Marry forsooth, because that Heretikes somtimes may deliuer true baptisme, woulde you not smile at me? And yet this way you shall finde many of your D. mighrie conclu|sions to looke, that is full side West, when the winde would serue him a great deale better into <HI>Flaunders.</HI> Therefore whereas it pleaseth M. <HI>Some,</HI> very perem|ptorily to tell his adversarie, that <HI>He hath prooved al|readie,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">175</NOTE> <HI>that true baptisme hath beene and may be out of the Church:</HI> We feare not to tell him as resolutely a|gaine, and that vpon good assurance, <HI>That neither he, nor all the Doctors of</HI> Sarbona <HI>(if they shold sweat their hearts out) can ever proove it while the worlde standeth.</HI> And therevpon we conclude against him, that <HI>To saye or write, that true baptisme hath bene or may bee out of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">176</NOTE> <HI>the Church, is a flat false proposition in divinitie,</HI> which by Gods assistance, and her Majesties good favor shal (if he dare procure the encounter) be openly mayn|tained against him or any man of his complexio~ with|in the land.</P>
<P>For that which is saide to be among th'Ismaelites and Edomites, I thinke by <HI>M. Somes</HI> fauor, that a man may truely saye it was no sacrament: Circumcison might well be amongst them, that is, the bare cutting of the foreskinne: but not the sacrament of Circum|cision, as laying on of water may be amongest Mid|wiues, but the sacrament of baptisme can neuer come
<PB N="90" REF="48">
from their handes: no more was it possible, that in that place where there was no ministerie, there could be anye sacrament, whatsoeuer man or Angell shall mutter against it. But M. <HI>Some</HI> wil prooue it you shal see, by <HI>M. Penries</HI> owne confession. For M. <HI>Penri</HI> saith thus: <HI>Neyther coulde any of the godly assure themselues, that an Edomitish priest administred true circumcision according to the substance:</HI> Wherevpon M. <HI>Some</HI> cour|seth him thus: <HI>If circumcision were among the Ismae|lites and Edomites (as you write and I affirme) then a</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">162</NOTE> <HI>sacrament was amongst them, I pray you remember this.</HI> In deede he had neede of a good remembraunce that should remember this, for eyther I do not vnderstand English, or els M. <HI>Penri</HI> saith no such thing: For how if a man should venter to say thus: <HI>He is not liuing that can assure himselfe, to finde eyther wit or learning in M. Bridges?</HI> Woulde your D. therevpon face vs downe, that we confesse there is either wit or learning in such a buzzard as he? Naye, he shoulde write 36. volumes more first, and every one shall be as bigge as his other booke, and then peradventure he may win our hearts. And here by the way, your D. is once more laide open to the charge of a false finger, which he cannot avoid: For where M. <HI>Penri</HI> speaking of th'Edomitish circum|cision, calleth it barely a <HI>Cutting of the foreskin and a prophanation of circumcision, &amp;c.</HI> thereby sufficiently expressing his meaning, M. <HI>Some</HI> the better to writhe in something to his advantage, and to make the mat|ter a little more saleable, hath twice at the least, foy|sted me in this worde <HI>true,</HI> which his adversatie hath not at all. As for example, these be M. <HI>Somes</HI> wordes: <HI>Circumcision in Idumea (as you write) was true circum|cision,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">114</NOTE> <HI>and a seale of Gods covenant.</HI> And againe to the same effect, <HI>If th'Edomitish circumcision were true cir|cumcision, and th'Edomitish church no church, then a sa|crament</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">166</NOTE>
<PB N="91" REF="48">
<HI>was out of the church.</HI> Howe like you this M. <HI>Penri?</HI> Wherevnto I doe not see, but that M. <HI>Penri</HI> might justly replie thus: <HI>If in all my writings you can|not finde that ever I gaue that name of true circumcisi|on to th'Edomitish circumcision, then are you taken tar|die M. Doctor, and manifestly convinced of legerdimain, How like you this M. Some.</HI></P>
<P>Now if M. <HI>Some</HI> could abide to be reuerenced, and would not returne it againe vpon vs as he doth to M. <HI>Penri</HI> with vncurteous and reprochful wordes, wee could here tel him, that we are sory, that a man of his estimation and grauitie, should cumber the eares of the learned with such winde shaken stuffe, as is fitter a great deale, for that sory chaplaine of <HI>Sarum,</HI> then for him. The best is he tels vs, <HI>That excellent men haue</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">144</NOTE> <HI>their second thoughts wiser then their first,</HI> &amp; that puts vs in some comfort, that he being (if he deceiue not himselfe) an excellent man, we shal (if it please God) for al his choller, see some printed record of a <HI>Seconde thought</HI> of his, that shal indeed be wiser, and of more pawzed and grounded judgment then the first, or els I promise you we are halfe shamed. And I tell you true, I like not this jeasting: Therefore me thinks it were good in this case, that your D. did set before his eies his noble Auncestor of <HI>Sarum,</HI> whoe by a foolish custome of reasoning thus loosely, and shuffeling in desperatly he cares not what, is so far gone as he seeth with a <HI>Fleuer Lourdaine,</HI> that his braine was neuer in good temper since. And certainly let him looke to it, for if he doe not better bethinke himselfe hereafter, to answere in other sort then hitherto he hath done, It will sure increase the Iealousie and suspition of ma|ny, who begin to distrust some priuy maime in M. <HI>Somes</HI> manhood, that he is not the man he is taken for and that all that greate knowledge which he so boa|steth
<PB N="92" REF="49">
of, wil without some speedy redres, fall ere it be long into some feareful consumption of the reyns, be|cause the veynes that swel so, are commonly fuller of winde then of bloud, yet for mine owne part, I had ra|ther a great deale attribute all these defects, byships &amp; out rules of his, to that extreame passion and vnrulye affection that quite overswareth his judgment, and is able both to mate and to amaze a man, yea and soe to blindefolde and bewitch him, that he may soone breake his face against a walle, if he looke not to it: And this sure was the cause (as I judge) that the ve|rye maine pointe betwixte his aduersatie and him, he had not (it shoulde seeme) any leasure to pervse: Eor the question being <HI>whether we may be assured to receiue a Sacrament at the Dumbe Ministers hands,</HI> the very marrow and life of the whole controuersie lying in this word. <HI>Assured,</HI> your D. hath faier giuen it the slipp, and hath not as far as I see in any on line, clauze or sentence thorough out his whole booke, so much as looked that way: Nay it seemeth to me, he is halse afraied of it when he seeth it. For in the last place that I before mentioned of th'Edomites, where M. <HI>Pemi</HI> saith that <HI>the godly cannot assure themselues, &amp;c.</HI> what saith M. <HI>Some</HI> to this?

For though a man shoulde make no question of the baptisme deliuered in times past by popish sha|uelings, but satisfiing himselfe with those other com|forts that he findeth in the holy excercises of Reli|gion, should neuer trouble himselfe to looke back so farre, though I say a man should make no question of that which is past, yet I se no hurt to desire to be assu|red in that which is to come, which <HI>Assurance</HI> (as M. <HI>Penri</HI> saith) can never be had but by saith, in the pro|mises of God, and that is the point he stands most vp|pon in al his writings, vz. that in the whole scripture of God there is no promise to bare readers, and men without gifts to deliuer, and therefore no warrant for vs to receiue any sacrament at their hands. All which if M. <HI>Some</HI> could overthrowe any otherwise then with some such stale jeasts as this, <HI>why then my grandefather was not christened,</HI> he might happen work more mira|cles then he is like to doe. For he must thinke, that it is neither these consequences nor inconueniences, that smel so much of the flesh, nor yet the authoritie of <HI>Calvin</HI> or <HI>Beza</HI> (though wee shoulde admire their gifts and reuerence them as Angells) that can settle a mans hart in this case, it must be only the word of the living God and nothing els, out of which, whensoeuer we see any sufficient recorde to warrant this promise wherevppon our faith must be grounded, it shall by Gods grace drawe presently from vs a willnig and re|uerent subscription to the truth, with an open revoca|tion of al that ever hath bin written in that pointe to to the contrary: But that there is no such Scripture to be had for money, wee gather as by others, so specialy by this late treatise of M. <HI>Somes,</HI> wherin I dare be bold to say, and I speake it advisedly, for I thinke I haue vewed it meetly wel, there is not to be found any on text of holy scripture to proue this <HI>Assurance,</HI> which

<P>Touching that point, <HI>That the popish Churche is in a sort the Churche of God, though an vnsounde Church:</HI> More then that, he croppeth out of <HI>Caluine, Phillip de Mornay</HI> and others (whiche was not written in suche strange characters neither, but that it might be easily vnderstood before M. <HI>Some</HI> reuealed it vnto vs) there is little I dare warrant you of his owne worth taking vp as they say: and that is the thing that we expect in a learned man, especially in this florishing age of the Gospell, to yeeld vs some sapp and ioyce of his owne, that thereby our judgements might be bettered, and we also occasioned to praise the giftes and graces of Gods spirit as wel in him as in others. Otherwise thus to cloy vs still, and ouercloye vs with other mens say|ings: why alasse, you see Th'alabaster man of <HI>Sarum</HI> can do that for need, and that I warrant you so thicke and in so good order, that if he coulde but handsomly turne to them without helpe, it were euen learning inough for a man of his mediocrity, neither might we well require more at his handes with modestie: as in one of his bookes (the 5. as I remember) you shal find that the good soule hath fumbled together, little lesse then 60. pages of other mens writings, and scarce 4. or 5. whole ones of his owne: and is not that a sweete kinde of bookemaking for a mirror to posteritie?

<P>What good lucke was it then, that the protestant churches should light on the name of reformed chur|ches at the first?

sort <HI>the Church of God,</HI> hauing overthrowne the foun|dation, and therefore must needs (whether M. <HI>Some</HI> will or noe) be the very <HI>Sinagog of Sathan:</HI> And then say I as before, that our magistrates haue done well, &amp; that which they may justifie by good warrant from Gods worde, otherwise they shoulde be apparantlye guiltie of a greuous sin which after my kinde of Lo|gicke I prooue thus.</P>
<P N="1">1 All christian Magistrates are bounde vtterly to divorce themselues from that Church, not only from the corruptions of that Church, but from that very Church and society it selfe, which hath made a diuor|cement from Christ &amp; erreth in the foundation of our faith:</P>
<P N="2">2 But the Romish Church (as is before sufficient|ly prooued) hath made such a divorcement &amp; erreth in the very foundation: <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P>Our Magistrates ought (as thanks be to God they haue done) vtterly to diuorce themselues from that very Church it selfe, &amp; therefore neede not M. <HI>Somes</HI> helpe to cleare them from being <HI>Scismatikes:</HI></P>
<P>Thus you may see M. <HI>Somes</HI> worthy distinction of <HI>our Magistrats, not severing themselues from the Church but from the Idolatrie of the Churche, &amp;c.</HI> Is by this meanes quite quashed in peeces: For if it were indeed in any sort the Church of God, then woulde fall out this strange <HI>paradoxe,</HI> that one and the selfe same bo|die of a Church might in a sort be the church of <HI>Christ</HI> and in a sorte againe the Churche of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> and that might be a peece of <HI>Iohn a Bridges</HI> diuinitie wel enough for the soundnesse of it: Furthermore if it were only but from the staines and corruptions of the popish Church that this our seperation was made (as M. <HI>Some</HI> woulde haue it) then belike they and we are both one body of a Church, though ours be as much

more refined body then theirs: But howe can that be when they holde not the same heade and foundation that we doe? For one body you knowe must haue but one head otherwise it is a monster: They then hauing an other heade, then we haue, we may safely conclude that they are not of the same body with vs, neither doe I see any warrant for a Christian man to seuere himselfe from the bodie of Gods Church (in that sort as we haue seuered our selues from <HI>Rome)</HI> for any ble|mishes or corruptions whatsoeuer: For so might out <HI>Brownists</HI> (if they list) get themselues a pretty plea|dable shelter of defence, and tel vs, <HI>That they doe not forsooth seuere themselues from our congregation as from the City: but from the plague that pestereth the citye.

the worlde that it is not for this or that corruption, or anye patches or peeces of vnsoundenesse, that wee haue thus seuered from the Romish Sinagogue, but only for that the very founteine it selfe is altogether as a poizened puddle, whence nothing can flowe na|turally but continuall streames of corruption? And therefore that it is not, nor neuer was since her gene|ral defection and Apostacie, any more the Church of God, then the very church of the heathen or Infidels. Marke I pray you, that I say noe more the Church of God, for albeit in some regarde it may peraduenture be neerer the Church of God, (in that they haue a|mongst them I knowe not what rubbishes, remnants, and traces of some good things,) yet to speake of a Church indeed as a Church, it may truely be saide to be no more the Church of God then the very church of the heathen or Infidels, I speake not heere of the nation of the Iewes, who in regarde of Gods promise are neerest of al, I speake only of the heathen and In|fidels, and in comparison with them, I say that as a lumpe of Iron or steele is no more an axe heade, then either a peece of wood or stone, though in nature &amp; possibilitie it be neerer: Euen so, if M. <HI>Some</HI> will haue vs say that the <HI>Romish Church</HI> is any thing neerer, or in possibilitie liker to be the Churche of God, then that of the hethen or Infidels, we wil not greatly stick with him: Any farther alowance we may not wel giue to the popish Church without sinne, the reason is be|cause it hath vtterly cast of the foundation of <HI>Iesus Christ crucified,</HI> without whome al the learning &amp; elo|quence of men or Angells can not make a Church, &amp; therefore he that shal either file his pen or straine his witts to prooue it, shall when he hath strugled to the vttermost, but miserably striue like a birde in the lime, and so flutter himselfe windelesse in his owne conceit.</P>

Nowe for those prerogatiues and preheminences that are co~monly giuen to the popish Church aboue other hethen &amp; Idolatrous Churches, if a man should aske M. <HI>Some</HI> what they be, it is like he woulde begin straight with true baptisme, which if M. <HI>Penri</HI> should stande vppon as a slat begging of the question, I doe not thinke that your D. with al his skil coulde trauel much farther that way: But alowe it to be so, that in popery there is baptisme, yet you see by M. <HI>Somes</HI> di|uinitie, we are neuer the neerer for a Church, because he holdes that <HI>true baptisme</HI> may be our of the church Wel what be the other good things that they are sup|posed to haue? If you say the <HI>Trinitie,</HI> I aske where? in their windowes? If you saye the scriptures, I aske where? in their coffers? If you say our sauiour Christ I aske howe many of them they haue, or rather howe many hundred dozen of them? For him alone I am sure, either as mediator, intercessor, or redeemer they haue not. So that a man may truely saye, they haue much good things but the swine eate them vp all. The very trueth is, let the fayth and profession of a christi|an be rightly scanned after the line of Gods word, and it will be found (howsoeuer men like to smothe it, or smother it) that they haue in deede none of all these things, and the more they haue of them, in that maner as they haue them, the greater is their condemnation And I take it, that M. <HI>Beza</HI> himselfe in his <HI>Antithesis</HI> betwixt the fayth of a christian, and the fayth of a pa|pist, doth sufficiently proue that they hold not a sou~d profession in anye one article of the fayth. Howe can that be then the Church of God that venteth &amp; run|neth our euery where, that faileth in euery article, &amp; hath not so much as one sounde sinowe to trust vnto? yea and by your leaue I do not see, but that out of M. <HI>Caluine</HI> himself if he were narrowly loked into (thogh

M. <HI>Some</HI> erect him as a piller against vs, in a manner in euery leafe) there might easily inough be drawne ar|guments to confirme this judgement of ours. I graunt indeed he saith thus: <HI>Whereas we will not simply grant to the papists the tytle of the Church, we do not therefore denie that there be churches among them:</HI> likewise again in another place in the same section he saith thus, <HI>We doe not denie but that vnder the tyrannie of Antichrist remaine Churches, &amp;c.</HI> Which is no more in effect then M. <HI>Some</HI> himselfe hath said before. And I cannot con|ceiue how this shoulde prejudice the cause any whit, for let vs draw it into forme if you please:</P>
<P><HI>Among the papistes there are Churches, or vnder the tyrannie of Antichrist there are Churches:</HI></P>
<P>Ergo <HI>The popish Church is in a sort the church of God</HI></P>
<P>I denie the argument, neither is there any conse|quence in it at all: For it is not inough say I, to be a|mong and vnder, but as I haue prooued before, they must be the~selues thorough papists, euen in the maine grounds of poperie, and so continue vnto th'ende, o|therwise it is not possible to frame th'argument, with out the string hault do what they can. Yet rather this semeth to be much stronger against it, when M. <HI>Caluin</HI> reasoneth to this effect: <HI>Like as a mans life is at an ende</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Institut. lib. 4. cap. 2. sect. 1.</NOTE> <HI>when his throat is thruste thorough, or his heart deadly wounded, So when lying is broken into the chief Tower of religion</HI> (as no man doubts I trow, but it is in poperie) <HI>the destruction of the Church followeth.</HI> Marke here, he saith not the corruption of the Churche (as M. <HI>Some</HI> wold haue it) but the destructio~ of the church, which immediatly after he explaneth thus: <HI>If the true church be the piller and stay of the truth, it is certaine that there is no Church</HI> (he dorh not saye an vnsounde Churche) <HI>where lying and falshood hath vsurped the dominion.</HI> Ye and in the fourth section of the same chapter, hee is
<PB N="113" REF="59">
yet more cleare for vs to this effecte: <HI>Where the do|ctrine of the prophets and Apostles is not, there remai|neth nothing that giues anye true signification of the church:</HI> if nothing, what babble they of baptism, Lords prayer and I know not what? But in poperie say I, the doctrine of the prophets and Apostles is not. <HI>Ergo:</HI> &amp; me thinkes th'argument is vnanswerable, which in the end of the seuenth section he confirmeth thus: <HI>Who dare call that the Church, where the worde of the Lord is openly and freely troaden vnder foote, yea the very soule of the Church is destroyed, &amp;c:</HI> But in poperie this is a|parant, <HI>Ergo.</HI> Lastly, in the tenth section of the same chap. he reasoneth thus: <HI>If they be Churches</HI> (saith he, speaking of popish Churches) <HI>then they haue the power of the keyes: But the keyes are vnseperably knit with the word, which from thence is quite driuen away,</HI> and there vpon he concludes, <HI>That either the promise of Christ is in vaine, or els that in that respect they are no Churches.</HI> Can any thing be spoken more plainely and directly then this? out of which places, howe if a man should now argue with M. <HI>Some</HI> in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Where the power of the keyes is not, and where the word of God is quite driuen away, there it is vnpossible to be any church of God at all:</HI></P>
<P><HI>But in poperie this is so, witnes M. Caluin. Ergo.</HI></P>
<P>I confesse to you it is strange, and strange againe to me, that the vizible Church being (as I take it) al|waies knowne by the Worde, Sacraments and Disci|pline: the speciall and principall marke of the 3. be|ing the worde, in that it giueth life and authoritie to th'other, there shoulde yet be a churche where this worde is not: that where this worde is quite driuen a|way, where the very soule of the church is destroyed, where there cannot be so much as any true significa|tion of the churche, the doctrine of the prophets and
<PB N="114" REF="60">
Apostles being vtterly bannished, wherefore I say, all this is (as Master <HI>Caluine</HI> sufficiently prooueth) there should yet be a Church, this is a wonderfull misterye to me. It had neede be in deede as they saye, a church <HI>secundum quid:</HI> And yet if there bee nor (as Master <HI>Caluine</HI> saith) so much as any <HI>true signification of the Churche)</HI> I doe not see but that they may bee bolde to blot out <HI>secundum quid,</HI> and by good warrant make it none at al: As for that which is saide of the Trinity, I aske whether the Deuil doe not also beleeue the Trinitie, for in the trinitie I am sure non of them both beleeue: I haue heard that <HI>Demones credunt et contre|miscunt:</HI> Then if this be a good argument, <HI>the Papist is better then the Turke because he holdes the Trinytie:</HI> Then say I, <HI>The Diuell is likewise better then the Turke because he holdes the Trinitie:</HI> There is only this diffe|rence, that the papist or the Turke may be a conuert and dye penitent, so can nor the Deuil, but then say I stil he is no longer either Turke or papist: By this you may see that it is not then hauing bare reading or cof|fering vp of the scriptures, Lordes prayer, Articles of the faith, &amp;c. Nor the naming, picturing or spelling of the Trinitie, but the sound profession of these holy things, according to the rule of Gods word that doth make the Church.</P>
<P>And me thinks (if a man consider of it well,) that which is aleaged before of M. <HI>Fulke</HI> against <HI>Stapleton,</HI> shoulde so cut the face of these poore prerogatiues brought in for defence of this <HI>Church Secundun quid,</HI> that they shoulde neuer peepe out of doores againe, in any printed record without blushing, shal I repeat it to you againe? <HI>Ispeeces of truth</HI> (saith he) <HI>might be sufficient to make them the Church of Christ, many here|tikes</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Contra.

What a squinteyed conclusion is this then, to drawe an argu|ment from <HI>Rightly saide, to Barely read?</HI> As if we were so childish to graunt him that which is <HI>Barely reade</HI> of a minister in his place &amp; function, were <HI>Rightly said,</HI> or that the hurrying over the Lords prayer or any o|ther piece of Scripture, either without booke or with|in booke were <HI>rightly saide:</HI> that is to say, that the word prophaned contrary to the holy ordinance and insti|tution of Christ were wholsome doctrine. But howe shal we doe nowe? M. <HI>Some</HI> hath yet spied out an o|ther blasphemie, an other strange pointe of diuinitie, and what is that? Forsooth <HI>The worde of God vttered, is not an edifying worde, vnlesse it be vttered according to th'ordinance, both in regarde of the persons that vttered the same, and the ende wherefore it is vttered:</HI> where|vppon he questioneth with his adversarie in this man|ner: <HI>Is not this</HI> M. Penri <HI>to make the person to giue cre|dite to the holy word of God? which position is very grosso</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">120</NOTE> <HI>&amp; blasphemons.</HI> We answere in M. <HI>Penries</HI> behalfe, no in deede is it not: First it is cleare M. <HI>Penri</HI> speaketh here (as he doth in the whole course of his booke) of that which is ordinary &amp; not extraordinary: For what
<PB N="120" REF="63">
haue we to doe nowe with miracles or extraordinary revelatious: Or (as I saide before) if any man be edifi|ed by a <HI>Play,</HI> by a <HI>Murther,</HI> by <HI>Blaspheming or propha|ning</HI> of the worde of God, what haue wee to doe with that? This being set downe then as a thing cleare and out of question that M. <HI>Penri</HI> speaketh onlye of that which is ordinarie, we answere that his assertion stan|deth firme and inviolable against M. <HI>Some</HI> and all the wrangling spirits in the world, vz. <HI>That the worde vt|tered is not an edefying word, vnlesse it be vttered accor|ding to the ordinance both in regarde of the persons, &amp;c.</HI> neither is this at all <HI>To make the person giue credite to the holy word,</HI> noe more then we say that the bread &amp; wine prepared for the Lords table, can be no sacram&eacute;t vnlesse he be a <HI>minister</HI> that deliuers it. Is this to make the sacrament depend vpon the person, or the person to giue credit to the sacrament? I think not, no more is it of the word. And who seeth not that when he spea|keth here of the <HI>persons,</HI> he meaneth not (as M. <HI>Some</HI> wold seem to enforce) of the dignity or worthines of the <HI>persons,</HI> or barely of the <HI>persons</HI> themselues as they be of men (for that were too childishe) but onely of the <HI>Calling and office of the parsons,</HI> whiche being the holy ordinance of God prescribed in the worde, what incongruitie or absurdity is it, for the Lord to restrane th'ordinarie blessing of edification to his owne ordi|nance, as if he should say, <HI>My word is in deed the worde of life, neuertheles if any man abuse it, or profane it, if a|ny man presume to deale withall, that hath no calling or warrant therevnto, let him neuer looke that I will bloue vpon it with my spirit.</HI> And who dare saye that there is or can be edification, where the Lorde breatheth not with his spirit? Therefore let M. <HI>Some</HI> say what he wil, there can be neither error nor heresy to make not the person, but the holy calling of the person, that is, the
<PB N="121" REF="63">
Lords owne ordinance to giue a majesty &amp; credite to his owne worde, which in trueth is nothing els, but to make the very word giue a credite to the word, and so it is <HI>Autopisos</HI> still. Now for his maner of writing, I rest euen of the same judgment I was, when the book came first into my hands: you know what I then told you vpon the first taste of it, &amp; I dare warrant you, you shall finde it to be true: for he is all in his short cuts &amp; questions like prety apothegs. What say you to 40. ful points in 50. lines, to 30. ful points, in 33. lines, to 6. ful points in 4. lines, to 4. ful points in 3. lines? Nay in one place, about the pa. 76. as I reme~ber, he hath more full points then lines: yen &amp; in that space that <HI>Iohn a Brid|ges</HI> hath one period, I dare be bound M. <HI>Some</HI> hath 50 or vpward. And is not that sententiously written? Nay farther, let his whol book be wel viewed, I meane his last book which of it self, is not much aboue 40. leaues &amp; that in a large letter, such as consumeth a great deal of paper in a little matter, &amp; I dare vndertake you shal finde aboue 1500. full points. So that whereas in one place he telleth his aduersary, that <HI>vnles it be granted him, that vnpreaching ministers haue no calling, he is at a</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">118</NOTE> <HI>ful point:</HI> his aduersary may now justly reply vpo~ him, vnles the contrary be graunted him, he is at a 1000. ful points. And I pray you tel me, are not his lungs in gret danger thinke you, that he is so short winded that he can scarce tie 2. propositio~s togither in mood &amp; figure I promise you for mine owne part I am halfe afraid of him, if he look not to himself in time. Wel, I could tel M. <HI>Some</HI> a notable receipt for this shortnes of breath, if he woulde be ruled by me. Firste he must crosse the Thames no more towards Lambeth, for the moistues of the air so nere the water side is very dangerous: he~ the closenes of London streats is perilous for the stop ping of his pipes: more, the great fare &amp; entertainme~t
<PB N="122" REF="64">
about the court &amp; at Bb. houses, may breede in time a <HI>Lethergie:</HI> therfore his only way (if he loue his helth) must be to get him into the country in th'open aire, &amp; to make his onely residence &amp; ordinary aboade vpon <HI>Gyrton</HI> benefice, shaking of all other appendixes and hangbies whatsoeuer, &amp; euen there in loue and consi|ence to take pains with his poore parishuers, aswel by publike teaching &amp; catechising of them, as by priuate admonishment &amp; familiar conferences, seeking to win them by all other good &amp; godly means that the Lord hath prescribed in his word. And let him ask M. <HI>Gren|ham</HI> whether this be not an excelent medicine for the shortnes of the breath, I warrant you he hath tried it, and hath found good of it, for he hath winde at wil ye see, &amp; as shril pipes as most men. Nowe M. <HI>Some</HI> may chuse he hath my direction for nothing, &amp; if I might see his water I might happen tell him more. I knowe there be other paltry practicioners in Phisike that wil aduise him otherwise, but let him take it of my word, it wil not be so good for him in the end. For it is sure this short windinesse and nothing els that makes him thus in a kinde of kingly maner with so many vncon|trollable periods to debate with vs: <HI>I agree with you in this: I dissent from you in this: strange sansies haue almost consumed you: your reuerence I make very base account of: I thinke great scorne I tell you, to be one of ignorant</HI> Penries <HI>disciples, &amp;c.</HI> Sure your D. perswadeth him|selfe I beleeue, that looke what he saith it is a statute straght, otherwise he woulde neuer come vppon his poore aduersary in this jumping manner. Wel for all that if he can make shift with all the skill he hath to fetch a jump fro~ his benefice at <HI>Girton</HI> to some sweet Deanry or Bishopricke, it wil sure be one of the preti|est jumps that euer he made in his life. There be of his betters that haue made such Alemaine leapes in their
<PB N="123" REF="64">
dayes, and thereby may the better direct him the way if neede be, how thinke you by these jumps. <HI>From Pe|ter house to Penbrooke hall, from thence to Trinitie Col|ledge, from thence to Lincolne, from Lincolne to Worce|ster, from Worcester</HI> you knowe whither. But were not these vengeable steps? Wel let your D. looke to it, for I haue knowne a man bursten in my daies, with fetch|ing such strides. And this I feare me is the blessinge that he so often harpeth vpon as wel in his preface as in his booke: <HI>It pleased God</HI> (saith he) <HI>to assist me gra|ciously</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">preface</NOTE> <HI>in my paines I haue taken: I thanke his maiestie very humbly for it: And I doubt not but he will giue a|blessing vnto it.</HI> And againe in an other place, <HI>I was de|sired</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">177</NOTE> (saith he) <HI>to prouide a plaster, I did so, and God hath giuen a blessing to it.</HI> And yet againe, <HI>I doubt not but that blessing which god hath giuen already to my last tre|tise, &amp; which his maiestie wil giue to this, wil marre your market.</HI> And last of all he closeth vp the mouth of all with this: <HI>My comforte is that almightie God will blesse</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">198</NOTE> <HI>this labor.</HI> But you may tel M. <HI>Some</HI> when you see him that I haue hearde of a man whoe dreaming of golde overnight, had but an ilfauored mishap in the morn|ning: These hasty promises of golden mountaines had neeede wee suppose haue better grounds, then these dreaming conceipts and fansies of men: For vnlesse it be some such blessing as I spake of before, namly some hope or promise of promotion, (which is not so pri|uiledged neither but that it may end in bitternesse) I durst me thinks in this case stand betwixt M. D. and the danger of any other <HI>greate blessing</HI> that may befall him. As to those high wordes of his, <HI>that he thinketh soule scorne to be one of ignorant</HI> Penries <HI>disciples, &amp;c.</HI> Considering howe rightly it sorteth with the rest of his rhetoricke, it can neither bring any grace to him&punc; selfe, nor disgrace to his aduersatie. Alasse it doeth but
<PB N="124" REF="65">
lay open the rottennesse and corruption of his harte, being very far from that spirit that teacheth, <HI>Let the greatest among you be as the least, &amp;c.</HI> It is wel enough knowne that there be M. <HI>Somes</HI> betters, I meane in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 22. 26.</NOTE> learning and judgment, that wil not refuse even in the feare of God to learne somtimes of far meaner men in gifts then ever M. <HI>Penri</HI> was, whome howe the Lord hath blessed in plentiful measure that way, his aduersa|ries themselues haue bin forced to acknowledge: but I woulde you would aske M. <HI>Some</HI> when you see him, where was <HI>Humile peccatum,</HI> when he did thus treade vpon his aduersarie with a disdainfull foote. Well to correct this bad humor of his, you may doe wel to re|ferre him to <HI>Apollos</HI> in the 18. of <HI>th' Act.</HI> who though he were <HI>an eloquent man &amp; mightie in the Scripture, in|formed in the way of the Lord, and seruent in the spirit,</HI> yet saith the text, did he not disdaine to learne of <HI>A|quila &amp; Priscilla,</HI> who expounded vnto him the way of God perfectly, wherevpon our Bb. owne note in the margent is this, which we presume M. <HI>Some</HI> will giue eare vnto with reuerence: <HI>Apollo</HI> (say they) <HI>being a learned man was not ashamed to be taught &amp; instruc|ted in the doctrine of Christ, of a poore crafts man &amp; his wise,</HI> what great disparagement then coulde it be for such a man as M. <HI>Some</HI> is, were he as great as an Archb. or a Cardinal, to learne some small trifling things of of a poorer and meaner student, because he knoweth that the Lord somtimes chooseth the weake thinges of the world to confound the wise. And therefore he that shoulde wish your D. lesse learning &amp; more mo|destie, shoulde I suppose wish him no hurt. Thus haue you my verdicte because you requested it: I confesse I haue bin too longe, but it is my falt, wherein as in any thinge els, I am very wel content you shal censure me as you please.</P>
