<HEAD>To the gentle Gentlewomen Readers.</HEAD>
<P>_GEntle Readers, whom by my will I woulde haue onely Gentlewo|men, and therefore to you I direct my woords. May it please you to vnderstand, that the great desire I haue to procure your delight, hath caused me somwhat to transgresse the boundes of faithfull freindship: for hauinge with great earnestnesse obtained of my very freinde Master <HI>George Pettie</HI> the copie of certaine Histories by himself vpon his owne and certaine of his freinds priuate occasions drawn into discourses, I saw sutch wittie &amp; pithie pleasantnes con|tayned in the~, that I thought I could not any way do greater pleasure or better seruice to your noble sexe, then to pub|lish them in print, to your common profit &amp; pleasure. And though I am sure hereby to incur his displeasure, for that he willed me in any wise to keepe the~ secret: yet if it please you thankfully to accept my goodwill, I force the lesse of his ill wil. For to speake my fancy without feigninge, I care not to displease twentie men, to please one woman: for the freind|ship amongst men, is to be counted but colde kindnesse, in respect of the feruent affection beetweene men and women: and our nature, is rather to doate of women, then to loue men. And yet it lyeth in your powers so to thinke of his do|ings, and to yeeld him sutch courteous consideration for the same, that hee shal haue more cause to thank me, then think ill of my faithles dealing towards him. Which if your cour|tesies shall perfourme, you shall increase my dutie towardes you, and his good will towards mee: you shall make me shew my will and him his skill another time to pleasure you: you shall binde both of vs to remaine ready at your commaun|dements.
<PB REF="3">
For mine owne part, I can chaleng no part of praise or thankes for this woorke, for that I haue taken no paines therein, neither by addinge Argument, Note, or any thinge, but euen haue set them forth as they were sent mee: only I haue christened them with the name of a <HI>Pallace of Pleasure.</HI> I dare not compare this woorke with the former Pallaces of Pleasure, because comparisons are odious, and because they co~taine Histories, translated out of graue authors &amp; learned writers: and this containeth discourses, deuised by a greene youthfull capacitie, and reported in a manner <HI>ex tempore,</HI> as I my selfe for diuers of them am able to testifie. I dare not commende them beecause I am partiall, I dare dedi|cate them to you Gentlewomen, beecause you are curteous. And that you may the better vnderstande the drift of these deuises, I haue caused the letter also which my freinde sent mee with this worke, to be set downe to your sight. Thus commending mine owne faithles enterprise, and my freinds fruitfull labour and learning, to your courteous protection, I wish you all, beuty with bounty, and cumlinesse with curte|sie, from my lodging in Fleetstreete.</P>

<HEAD>The Letter of G. P. to R. B. concerning this woorke.</HEAD>
<P>_FOrced by your ernest importu|nity, and furthered by mine owne idle opor|tunity, I haue set downe in writinge, and ac|cordynge to your request, sent vnto you cer|taine of those Tragicall trifles, whiche you haue heard mee in sundrie companies at sun|drye times report, and so neare as I could I haue written them word for word as I then told them: but if any of them seeme bet|ter vnto you now then they did then, you must attribute it to my lisping lips, which perchaunce did somewhat disgrace the grace of them: and yf any seeme worse now then than, you must impute it to this, that perchaunce there was then some <HI>Pallas</HI> in place which furthered my inuention. For I am in that point of <HI>Ouid</HI> his opinion, that, <HI>Si cupiat sponte disertus erit.</HI> But whether they seeme vnto you good or ill, I trust you will take them as a token of good will, and that is the onely commoditie I looke to reape by them. I pray you only to vse them to your owne priuate pleasure, and not to impart them to other, perchaunce to my pre|iudice, for that diuers discourses touch neerely diuers of my nere freindes: but the best is, they are so darkely figured forth, that only they whom they touch, can vnderstand whom they touch: yet to auoide all captious constructions, I pray you in any wise let them bee an obiect only for your owne eyes. If this mislike you in my discourses, that I make <HI>Camma,</HI> vse the example of the countesse of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> the Dutches of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> and sutch who were of far later yeeres, then the auncient <HI>CAMMA</HI> is, with the like in diuers other of the stories: you must consider that my <HI>Cam|ma</HI> is of fresher memory then any of them, and I thinke in your iudgment, of fresher hew then the fayrest of them. Likewise, if you like not of some wordes and phrases, vsed contrary to their common custome, you must thinke, that seeing wee allowe of new fashions in cutting of beardes, in long wasted doublets, in litle short hose, in great cappes, in low hattes, and almost in al things, it is as mutch reason wee should allow of new fashions in phra|ses

and wordes. But these faultes, or whatsoeuer els, I care not to excuse vnto you, who are the only cause I co~mitted them, by your ernest desire to haue mee set downe these trifles in writing. And as my wordes hytherto haue tended to this end, that you should take these trifles well, so now I am to exhort you that you will vse them well: that with the spider you sucke not out poyson out of them: that by some light example you bee not the sooner inci|ted to lightnesse. For beleeue mee (I speake it freindly, therefore take it freindly) I thinke it more needfull to send you a bridell then a spur that way. And if my example may bee a bridle to restraine you from vanity, doe but imitate mee hereafter, or if my counsayle may containe you in continency, doe but follow this aduise: if you bee free, that you come not into bondes: if you bee bound, <HI>vt te redimas captum quam queas minimo:</HI> for trust me, the broad blasphemy of <HI>Pigmalion,</HI> and the sodain <HI>Aposta|cie,</HI> or rather right conuersion of <HI>Alexius,</HI> haue setled me in this fayth, that I thinke him <HI>Ter&abque; quater&abque; beatum, qui a con|sortio mulierum se cohibere potest.</HI> You meruayle, I am sure to heare these wordes of mee, and that I should so soone turne my tippet and recant, who but yesterday, as it were, entred into heresy.

<HEAD>The Printer to all Readers of this Booke.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HAuing sumtime in my custodie this Booke in written</HI> hande, which by meanes of a special freind of mine was co~mit|ted vnto mee, I was by him eft soones ernestly sollicited to publish the same in printe. Who beeing sutch an one, whose request I would not willinglie denie, I fell to perus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nge the woorke, and perceyued at the first by the Auctours letter, that hee was not wyl|ling to haue it common, as thinkinge certaine poynts in it to bee to wanton to bee wrought by that wit which by this woorke appea|reth to bee in hym: which, as I coniecture, mooued him to write to his freinde to keepe it priuate to his owne vse, as may appeare by his freindes Epistle, and his Letter goyng beefore. Neuer|thelesse, to accomplish the desire of the one, and not to incurre the displeasure of the other, as also to pleasure you, the freindly Rea|ders hereof, I haue put the same in printe, vsing my discretion in omitting sutch matter as in the Aucthours iudgement might seeme offenciue, and yet I trust not leauing imperfection in the discourse, wherof if I haue not gelded to mutch, I thinke I haue deserued the lesse blame. And consideryng that in matters of pleasure, the Prynter may sooner offende in printyng to mutch, then in publi|shyng to litle: I haue applyed my selfe to the contrary, hopynge that how mutch the lesse I haue printed, reseruynge the discourse perfect, so mutch the lesse I shalbe blamed for the deede. As for the Gentleman that wrote this woorke, and his freinde that pro|cured it to bee published: as they are vnknowen to mee both, so had I conference with neither, wherby the lesse I could vse their aduice in abridging any thinge, which may bee some cause of the disgracinge of that, which doubtlesse the Auctour had penned with great excellency, and eloquence. If herein, as I feare, I haue offended, I am willing, beeynge aduertysed therof, to bee refour|med, crauinge pardon of him especyally, and of all other freindly Readers, for the ouersightes whatsoeuer herein committed: for whose pleasure and profite I haue left vndoone, and doone, what soeuer I haue doone in this behalfe. I haue also of my selfe added an argument to euery history, that the effect of the discourse may bee the more easily caryed away.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>SINORIX, cheif gouernour of <HI>Sienna</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> glaun|cynge his eyes vpon the glitteryng bewtie of <HI>Camma,</HI> wife to <HI>Sinnatus,</HI> a Gentilman of the same citie: falleth into extreame loue with her, and assaieth sundry waies to win her goodwill. But perceiulnge his practices to take no wished effect, and supposinge the husbandes life to hinder his loue, causeth him to bee murthered by a russian. <HI>Camma,</HI> to the intent she might bee re|uenged vpon the cheife conspiratour, in grauntinge him marriage, dispatcheth her selfe in drinkinge to him, and him in pledging her in a draught of poyson, which she had prepared for that purpose.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="1" REF="5"><HI>_AS amongest all the bondes of</HI> beneuolence and good wil, there is none more honorable, auncient, or honest then Mariage, so in my fansie there is none that doth more firmely fasten, and inseparably vnite vs to|gether then the same estate doth, or wherein the fruites of true freendship do more plenteously appeare: In the Father is a certayne seuere loue and carefull good will towardes the childe, the childe beareth a fearefull affection and awfull obedience towards the Father: the Master hath an imperi|ous regarde of the seruant, the seruant a seruile care of the master. The frendship amongest men is grounded vppon no law, and dissolued vpon euery light occasion: the good will of kinsfolke is commonly colde, as mutch of custome as of deuotion: but in this stately state of Matrimonie, there is nothing fearefull, nothing fayned, all things are done faith|fully without doubting, truely without doublyng, willingly without constraint, ioyfully without complaint: yea there is sutch a generall consent and mutuall agr&eacute;ement between the man and wife, that they both wish and will, couet and craue one thing. And as a sience grafted in a strange stalke, their natures being vnited by grothe, they b&eacute;ecome one, and together beare one fruite: so the loue of the wife planted in the breast of her husband, their harts by continuance of loue become one, one sence and one soule serueth them both. And as the sience seuered from the stocke withereth away, if it b&eacute;e not grafted in some other: so a louing wife seperated fro~ the societie of her husband, withereth away in woe, and leadeth a life no lesse pleasant then death, as the sequele of this history shall shew, wherin you shall s&eacute;e a meruaylous Mirrour of blessed Matrimony, and a terrible tipe of beast|ly tyrannie.</P>
<P>In the Citie <HI>Sienna</HI> was a married couple, the husbande named <HI>Sinnatus,</HI> the wife called <HI>Camma,</HI> who as they were
<PB N="2" REF="6">
by estate worshipfull, by vertue honorable, and by goodnesse gracious, so were they in ritches fortunate, in children fruitfull, in friends flowrishinge, and in loue so loyall eche to other, that they long time led a louinge and quiet life to|gether: but either fortune enuying their prosperity, or the diuell displeased with their vertuous life, or God disposed to try their truth, and make them patterns to their posterity, conuerted this hapy life to heauy estate, and raysed vp one <HI>Synorix</HI> to raze and beat down the firme foundacion of their faithfull buildinge and bydinge together. For this <HI>Sinorix</HI> glauncing his gazing eyes on the blazinge beuty of <HI>Camma,</HI> receiued so d&eacute;ep an impression, of her perfection in his hart, that immediatly he fixed his fancie vpon her comely corps. And beinge the chiefe ruler of the citie, hee perswaded him self that there was none in the city so stout but would stoup to his lure, nor none so faire but would faine imploy them selues to pleasure him: but on the other side the renow|med vertue of <HI>Camma</HI> came to his minde, which perswaded an impossibility to his purpose: and floting thus betw&eacute;ene hope and dispaire he entred into these termes.</P>
<P>O miserable wretch that I am, to whom shall I addresse my complaintes, is it the heauenly powers and goddes of loue that haue depriued mee of my sences, and shewed their deuine working in m&eacute;e, or is it the hellish Hags and spirites of spight that haue bereeued m&eacute;e of reason, &amp; executed their cruelty on m&eacute;e? is it loue that leadeth me to this lust, or is it hate that haleth mee to this hurt and mischiefe, no no the gods guide vs to goodnesse, the furies of hell it is that force vs to silthynesse: neyther doth it any way deserue the name of loue, which bringeth such torment to my troubled minde, that all the diuels in the world could not do the like. But s&eacute;e my rashnes why am I so blindly bolde beastly to blaspheme against that which proc&eacute;edes altogether of nature, which na|ture hath imparted to all men, and which I ought to follow without repininge or resistinge: for so long as I follow na|ture as my guide I cannot doe amisse, &amp; seing nature hath
<PB N="3" REF="6">
taught vs to loue, why should I not rather prooue her pre|cepts, then reproue that which by natures lore is allowed: and touchinge torment of minde, or either inconuenience that it bringeth, is it all able to impaire the least ioy which I shall inioy in imbracinge my <HI>Camma,</HI> is it not meete that h&eacute;e which would reape should sowe, he that would gather fruite should plant tr&eacute;es, h&eacute;e that would reach the sw&eacute;ete rose should now &amp; then be scratched with the sharpe briers? I meane it is meet if I purpose to possesse so proper a p&eacute;ece, as <HI>Camma</HI> is, that I should sly no labour or refure any peril in the pursute therof. And here vpon he determined to fol|low the fury of his fancy what pangues or perils soeuer h&eacute;e incurred therby: and hauing reuolued many wayes in his minde how h&eacute;e might aspire to his purpose, at length he re|solued vpon this to institute a sumptuous Banquet, wherto h&eacute;e inuited the ch&eacute;eif of the citie, among whom <HI>Synnatus</HI> and his wife <HI>Camma</HI> were not forgotten, to wit the only autors of the feaste. Now for the more royall receiuinge of his guestes he met them at the entry into his Palaice, and gaue them this gr&eacute;eting.</P>
<P>Faire Ladies as I am right ioyfull of your presence, so am I no les sorowfull for the paines which you haue taken in vndertaking so great a iourney this dark and misty eue|ning, for the which I must account my selfe so mutch the more beholdinge to you, by how much greater your labour was in comming, and by how mutch lesse your chere shalbe able to counteruayle it now you are come: &amp; taking <HI>Camma</HI> by the hande, hee sayd softly vnto her, I pity the peines of these gentlewomen the les for that you were in their com|pany, whose piersing eyes as celestiall starres or heauenly lampes might serue for lightes in the darke, whose sw&eacute;ete face might parfume the aier from all noysome smels which might annoy them: and by beholding your louely lookes and perfect shape they might take sutch delight, that the weary|nesse of the way could nothing molest or gr&eacute;eue them.</P>
<P><HI>Camma</HI> hearing her selfe so greatly praysed of so great a
<PB N="4" REF="7">
personages as h&eacute;e was, could not k&eacute;epe the Roseal redde out of her Alablaster ch&eacute;ekes, and thinking no sutch serpentine malice to lie hid vnder these merry and sugred woordes, sh&eacute;e gaue him this courteous answere.</P>
<P>If Sir the company had made no better prouision for lights and other thinges necessary then sutch as you speake of, they might soone haue slipt into the mier, but as I per|ceiue by your woords you are disposed to iest and b&eacute;e m&eacute;ery, so I am content for this once to b&eacute;e made the instrument thereof, thereby to ease some part of the paines which you are like to take in receiuing sutch troublesome guestes as wee are: and for our chere you n&eacute;ede take no thought, for it shalbe so mutch to good for vs, by how mutch lesse w&eacute;e haue deserued any at all at your handes.</P>
<P>After this amarousin counter, he caused the company to sit downe to the banquet, and so disposed the matter, that <HI>Gamma</HI> sat right ouer at the table against him, wherby h&eacute;e fr&eacute;ely fed his eyes on that meat which conuerted rather to nourishment of sicknesse, then to wholesome humours of health. For as the finest meates that b&eacute;e, eaten by one in ex|tremity of sicknesse, resolue not to pure bloud to streng|then the body, but to watrish humors to f&eacute;ede the feuer and disease: so though her face and lookes were fine and sw&eacute;ete, and brought delight to all the beholders els, yet to him they wrought onely torment and trouble of minde: and notwith|standing hee perceiued her beauty to br&eacute;ed his bane, &amp; her lookes to procure the losse of his liberty, and that as the <HI>Co|catrice</HI> by sight only sleath, so sh&eacute;e by courteous countenance onely killed and wounded his hart, yet could he not refrain his eyes from beholding her, but according to the nature of the sickly pacient, which cheifly desireth that which cheiflye is forbidden him, h&eacute;e so incessantly threw his amarous glau~|ces towards her, that his eies were altogether bleared with her beauty, and sh&eacute;e also at the length began to perceiue his louing lookes towards her, which made her looke pale in token of the litle pleasure shee tooke in his toyes, and of the
<PB N="5" REF="7">
great feare shee had least, some other should marke them, wherby her good name might come in question. The ban|quet beeing ended, euery one prepared themselues to heare a stage playe, which was then ready to b&eacute;e presented. But <HI>Synorix</HI> being able to play but one part, which was of a pore passionat louer, determyned to go forward with the tragedy already begun betw&eacute;ene <HI>Camma</HI> and him, and s&eacute;eing her set out of the husbandes sight, placed him self by her, and entred into reasoning with her, to this purpose. If (faier lady) this simple banquet had bene so sw&eacute;ete and pleasant to your s&eacute;emely selfe and the rest, as your sight is delightful to mee, I am perswaded you would not haue changed your chere for <HI>Nector</HI> and <HI>Ambrosia,</HI> which the Poetes faygned to b&eacute;e the foode of the goddes: but seeing there was no cause of de|lighte in the one, and the other contayneth that in it which may content the gods them selues, I shall desier you in good part to accept the one, and courteously to accounte me wor|thy to inioy the other. And though I haue not here tofore by dutifull seruice manifested vnto you the loyalty of my loue, yet if my poore hart could signifie vnto you the assaults it hath suffred for your sake, I doubt not but you would con|fesse, that by force of loue I had woon you, &amp; were worthy to weare you. For albeit by humane lawes your husband only haue interest in you, yet by natures lawes, which beinge more auncient ought to be of more auctority, he ought to in|ioy you which ioyeth most in you, which loueth you best, &amp; indureth most paine for your sake: &amp; for proufe of natures lawes, it may please you to consider the quality of the sh&eacute;e woulfe who alway choseth that woulfe for her make who is made most leane and foule by following her: besides that, my tytle marcheth vnder the ensigne of iustice, which is a vertue giuinge to euery one accordinge to his deserte, and that the desert of loue is onely loue againe, I know you are not to know: for all the goods in the worlde are not able to requite good will, the one belonginge to the minde, the o|thers incident to the body, but from the equitie of my cause
<PB N="6" REF="8">
I appeale to your good grace and fauour, and at the bar of your beauty I humbly holde vp my handes, meaning to be tried by your courtesy and mine owne loyalty, and minding to abide your sentence either of consent vnto life, or of deni|all vnto death. <HI>Camma</HI> hearing this discourse, asso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e loked red for shame, as soone pale for anger, neither would disdain let her make him answere, neither would her greife giue her leaue to holde hir peace, but standing a while in a maze betw&eacute;ene silence and saying, at length shee brake of the one and burst out into the other in this sort.</P>
<P>If (Sir) your banquet had bene no better, then this your talke is pleasant to m&eacute;e, I am perswaded the dishes woulde haue b&eacute;en taken whole from the Table without touchinge, but as the one was far better then the company deserued, so the other for a far worse woman might more fitly haue ser|ued, and if your sw&eacute;ete meate haue sutche sower sauce, the next time you send for m&eacute;e, I will make you sutch answere as was made to <HI>Cratorus</HI> the Emperour by <HI>Diogenes,</HI> when he sent for him to make his abode with him in his courte, who answered he had rather be fed at <HI>Athens</HI> with salt, the~ liue with him in all delicacy: so for my part I promise you, I had rather be fed at home with bread and water then pay so derely for dainty dishes. Touching the paines you haue indured for my sake, I take your wordes to bee as false to|wardes mee, as you would make my faith towards my hus|band, but admit they were true, seeing I haue not willing|ly been the cause of them, I count not my self bound in con|science to counteruayle them, only I am sory they were not bestowed on some more worthy your estate and lesse wor|thy an honest name then my selfe, which beinge the cheife ritches I haue, I meane most diligently to keepe. The in|terest which cauilingly you cleime in me as it consisteth of false premises, so though the premises were true, yet the conclusion which you infer thereof followeth not necessa|rily, for were it so that your loue were greater towardes me then my husbandes (which you can not induce me to be|l&eacute;eue)
<PB N="7" REF="8">
yet s&eacute;eyng my husbande by order of law hath first ta|ken possession of m&eacute;e, your title succ&eacute;eding his, your successe and sute must n&eacute;edes b&eacute;e cold &amp; naught: for as your selfe say of lawes, so of titles the first are euer of most force, and the most ancient of most auctoritie. Your Wolues example, though it shew your Foxely brayne, yet doth it inforce no sutch proofe to your purpose, but that by my former reason it may b&eacute;e refelled, for y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Woulfe is fr&eacute;e from the proper possession of any: but therin truly you obserue decora~ very duly, in vsyng the example of a Beast in so beastly a cause: for like purpose, like proofe: like man, like matter. Your manly marchyng vnder the ensigne of Iustice, if reason b&eacute;e your captayne generall to lead you, I doubt not, but soone to tourne to a retire: for if it b&eacute;e goodwill which you beare m&eacute;e, I must n&eacute;edes graunt you duly deserue the like agayne: but when you are able to prooue it goodwill to deflower my cha|stitie, to b&eacute;er&eacute;eue m&eacute;e of my good name, to despoyle m&eacute;e of mine honour, to cause m&eacute;e to transgresse the boundes of ho|nestie, to infringe my faith towards my husband, to violate the sacred Rytes of Matrimonie, to pollute the Temple of the Lorde, with other innumerable enormities, when I say you are able to prooue these to proc&eacute;ed of good will, then will I willingly y&eacute;elde consent to your request.

If the wicked vanquish the vertuous, who shal set foorth thy honour and glory, or who will so mutche as once call vpon thy name? But what meane I wretched wight to exclayme agaynst God as the aucthour of my euill, wheras it is only I my selfe that am guiltie of my husbandes death? It is I that pampred vp my beutie, to make it glister in the sight of e|uery gazynge eye, in the thriftlesse threade wherof this Tirant was so intangled, that to vnwinde himself there|out hee hath wrought all this mischeif. It is I that would not detect his doynges to my husband, wherby hee might haue preuented the perill which hung ouer his head. And seeyng I haue been the cause of his death, shall I be|yng a murtherer remayne aliue? Did <HI>Alcyone</HI> seeynge the dead carkas of her husbande <HI>Ceix</HI> cast on shore, wil|lingly cast her selfe into the Sea to accompany his death. And shall I see my sweet <HI>Synnatus</HI> slayne, and not drinke of the same cuppe? Did true <HI>Thisbe</HI> goare her gorgious body with the same sworde, wherwith princely <HI>Piramus</HI> had prickt him selfe to the hart: and are not my handes stronge inough to do the like? Did <HI>Iulietta</HI> die vpon the corps of her <HI>Romeo,</HI> and shall my body remayne on earth, <HI>Synnatus</HI> beyng buried? No gentle death come with thy direfull dart, and peirce my paynefull harte, and with one death rid mee out of a thousande deathes at once. For what thought do I thinke on my <HI>Synnatus,</HI> which doth not procure mee double death? What thing do I see belong|yng to him, which is not a treble torment vnto mee? But it is cowardlinesse to wish for death, and couragiousnesse valiantly to take it. Yes I can and will bestow my lyfe for my <HI>Synnatus</HI> sweete sake: but O God shall that Ty|rant remayne aliue to triumphe in his trechery, &amp; vaunt

It is his bloud that wilbe a most sw&eacute;ete sacri|fice to the ghost of <HI>Sinnatus,</HI> not mine: and then can I ende my life contentedly when I haue offred vp this accepta|ble sacrifice: and vntill sutch time as I haue oportunity hereto, I will prolonge my dolefull dayes in direfull greefe, and onely the hope of reuengment, shall heauily holde my lothsome life and sorowfull soule together? For other cause why I should desire life I haue not, for that I am vtterly depriued of all ioyes of life. For as the bird that is bruised with some blow lieth aloofe on the leaues, and heares his felowes singe, and is not able to vtter one warblinge note out of his mournfull voice, but rather hates the harmony which other birdes doo make, so I, my heart beeing broosed and broken, sit solitarily alone and s&eacute;e some hange about their husbandes neckes, some closely clepe them in their armes, some trisle with them, some talke with them, all which sight redoubleth my paine to thinke my self depriued of those pleasures: yea to a wret|ched wounded heart that dwels in dole, euery pleasaunt sight turnes to bitter spight: and the onely obiecte which shall euer content my eyes, shall bee the distruction of that tyraunt, which hath brought mee to this desolation.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Synorix</HI> thinking that time had taken away her teares and sorrow, and supposinge that neither sh&eacute;e, nei|ther any other had suspected him for the murther of her husband, began to enter into the listes of lust againe, and with a new incountry of incontiuency to set vpon her. But sh&eacute;e so mutch abhorred him, that if shee but heard his name it caused her nature to fayle in her, and all her sen|ces to faint: so that when hee saw no posibility to impell her to impiety, hee ment to moue her in the way of ma|riage and caused her nere kinsfolke and friends to solicite his sute vnto her, who partly for feare of his displeasure, partly for that they knew it would b&eacute;e greatly to her ad|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">auncement, laboured very ernestly in the matter, and

And the day of the solemnizing of the mariage b&eacute;einge come, they went together to the temple of <HI>Diana</HI> wher al things according to custome beeing consummated, the bride wife (as the vse was) dranke to her husband in drinke as h&eacute;e thought, but ind&eacute;ede in poyson which sh&eacute;e had prouided of purpose: and when sh&eacute;e saw h&eacute;e had drunke vp his death, sh&eacute;e sayd vnto him goe now and in st&eacute;ed of thy mariage bed get th&eacute;e a graue, for thy mariage is turnd to murther, a punishment most iust for thy outragious lust and cruell tyranny 'for vengeance asketh vengeance, &amp; bloud bloud, and they y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sowe slaughter, shalb&eacute;e sure to reape ruine and destruction.

<P>O goddesse, thou knowest how since the death of my sweete husband, this life hath b&eacute;ene most lothsome and sower vnto m&eacute;e, and that the only offeringe vp of this sa|crifice kept m&eacute;e from him, which now in thy presence I haue perfourmed I thinke my selfe to haue satisfied my duty, and purchased therby a pasport to passe to the place and Paradise where my husband hath his habitation.</P>

But destinies so draue that shortly after this, on a night in his sleape h&eacute;e s&eacute;emed to s&eacute;e her stand apparent|ly before him (only a stronge imagination assurynge him that it was shee) which sight sunke so deeply into his heart and brought him sutch excessiue delight, that hee present|ly awaked, and missyng the partie that procured him such pleasure, his ioy was tournd to anoy: neither coulde hee euer after that finde any contentation in any thought or deed, but only in this determination to goe haue a true sight of her, whose seemyng shadow had so dazeled his eyes: and with all speed repayred his shippes, and prepa|red al thyngs necessary for sutch a voyage, and by the help of good wynde and will, shortly arriued there where his hart had already cast anker: and sent ambassadours to the kyng to certifie him of his commynge, who receyued him with royaltie fit for his regall estate. And at the first incountry of the two princes <HI>Tereus</HI> sayde.</P>
<P>My commyng vnto you O noble prynce is not as an open enemie to inuade you, for you see I am vnarmed, neither as a secret traytour to intrap you, for you know I am your freend: but that you may not meruayle at my sodayne cummyng, you shall vnderstand it is to s&eacute;e your daughter the Lady <HI>Progne,</HI> for you shall soone perceyue I pretende well vnto her. <HI>Pandian</HI> answered.</P>
<P>As (most worthy prince) the cause of your comming is friendly, so can I not but friendly accept it, and how much I thinke my selfe honoured therby so mutch I count my selfe bound vnto you.</P>
<P>And after a litle parlee passed betweene them of the e|states of their realmes and manners of their countreies, <HI>Pandion</HI> preferred him to the sight of his daughter, whom

<P>If faire Lady, I should tell the truth of my comming into this country, I thinke you would take it but for a trifling toy, yea if I should in woords plainly set downe y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> cause of this my interprised iourney, and the case which through your meanes I remaine in, I doubt you would neither beleeue the cause, neither rel&eacute;eue my case: for y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the straungnesse of the one would br&eacute;ed great incredulity &amp; for the other the small acquaintance I haue with you &amp; lesse deserts towards you can craue smal curtesy: yet if it please you to know, neither the desire to see this country, neither the renoume of your vertue &amp; beauty brought me hither, for though the report therof be great, yet now I se I must n&eacute;edes say, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> fame hath rather framed your praise maliciously then reported it truly, for one good part re|ported to b&eacute;e in you, I perceiue by your countenance such confluence of good conditions, that I can not but counte the rumor which run of you, rather sparing speeche then right reporte. But the cause of my hasty comminge and heauy case is this, it pleased the goddes to presente your seemely selfe to my presence, in the same louely likenesse wherin you are at this present, what time I tooke sutch veiwe of your sweete face, that approchinge this daye to your fathers palaice, b&eacute;efore I knew who you were, what you were, or where you were, as you looked if you reme~|ber it, out at your chamber window, I said to my serua~ts, loe yonder standes the p&eacute;ereles peragon princely <HI>Progne:</HI> and since y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sight in my sl&eacute;epe, I take the heauens to wit|nesse I neuer inioyed one quiet sleepe, but continued in co~templation how I might be placed in possession of that personage which draue me into sutch admiration.

And if I haue preferred your loue before all the Ladies of my owne land, if I make you that profer which many princes haue pressed for, if neither wearines of way, nei|ther perils of sea could prohibite mee from pursuing your good will, if I bee content to resigne my kingdome, liber|ty and all that I haue into your handes, I shall desire you not to co~temne my curtesy, but to counteruaile my paine and to returne my goodwill with like loue and affection. This request also resteth to make vnto you that you driue mee not of with trifeling delayes, for neither will the extremity of my perplexity permit longe delay, ney|ther will the estate my kingdome standeth in, suffer mee longe to bee away.</P>
<P><HI>Progne</HI> hearing the ernest sute of this prince, and see|inge nothing in him to be misliked, considering also what haste his request required, stood not vpon the nice termes of her virginity, but with a reuerence of maiesty made him this answere.</P>
<P>Most worthy prince whatsoeuer were the cause of your comming into this countrey, the kinge my father hath to holde himselfe mutch beeholding to your maiestie, that it would please you too do him the honour to visite him: but touching the cause you pretend, I doubt not but your wis|dome knoweth that dreames are doubtfull, and visions are altogether vaine and therfore I must craue pardon if I hardly beleeue, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> vpon so light a cause you would vn|dertake sutch heauy trauayle: and I mutch muse that in your sleepe the goddes had no seemelier sight then my selfe to present vnto you: but whether beefore you came hether, the goddes moued your minde, or whether beeing here your owne fancy forced your affection towards mee, assure your selfe this, if your loue bee as loyall, as your wordes seeme wonderfull in shewing the originall ther|of, you shal not finde mee either so discourteous as to con|temne your goodwill, either so vngratefull as not to re|quite

it, mary as I may, which is for your harty goodwil to giue you my hart, for any benefit of my body it is not in mee to bestow on you: for if you do mee that iniury to exacte any thing at my handes lasciuiously, honesty will not allow it, whose boundes I meane not to transgresse, and if you doe mee that honour to pursue my good will in the way of mariage, perchance my parents will not per|mit it, who onely haue power to place mee at their plea|suer. So that as the one halfe and moytie of mee is not mine, so the other part, if your goodwill bee as greate as you pretend, shalbee yours. Presently vpon this he pre|ferred his sute to her parentes, who were no lesse glad of sutch a sonne in law, then hee of sutch a wife?

<P>Nay, there was neuer blouddy tiger that did so terri|bly teare the litle Lambe, as this tiraunt did furiously fare with faire <HI>Philomela.</HI> For beeing in ship together, hee began filthily to fixe his fancy vpon her, and castinge the feare of god front before his eies, rootinge the loue of his wife out of his heart, contemninge the holy rites of matrimony, and the sacred state of virginity, h&eacute;e fell to fleshly daliance with her, and attempted to win that point of her, which sh&eacute;e held more dere and precious then her life, and which ought to b&eacute;e of curious regard to al women

<P>Ah most tirrannous Traytor, hast thou thus betrayed my father and sister, haddest thou no other to worke thy wickednesse on but m&eacute;e, who was the iewell of my father and the ioy of my sister, and now by thy meanes shalbe the distruction of the one, and the desolation of the other?

<P>THe Astronomers are of this opinion that the Planets haue preheminence ouer vs, and that the Starres stir vs vp to all our enterprises, but I am rather setled into this sentence that not the Planets but our passions haue the cheife place in vs, and that our owne desires not the destines dryue vs to all our doynges: whiche opinion I may iustifie by the example of a Gentleman named <HI>Ger|manicus,</HI> whose fortune, neither the Fates fixed, neither the Planets planted, neither the Starres stirred, neither
<PB N="39" REF="24">
the destines draue, neither the Shies caused, but first his owne fonde fancie framed, and then his owne ambitious desire finished as by the sequele of this Hystorie you shall s&eacute;e. For this Gentleman <HI>Germanicus</HI> frequentynge the court of <HI>Octauian</HI> the Emperour, chaunced to fixe his eyes on the face of a noble Gentlewoman named <HI>Agrippina,</HI> the daughter of <HI>M. Agrippa,</HI> and as the Mouse mumpeth so longe at the bayte, that at length she is taken in trap, so hee bit so longe at the bayte of her beutie, that at length hee was caught in <HI>Cupids</HI> snare: and on a time as sh&eacute;e was at Cardes in the Presence chamber, this youth stoode sta|ryng in her face in a great studdy, which sh&eacute;e perceiuynge to bryng him out of his studdy, prayed him to reache her a boale of Wyne which stoode vppon a Cupboord by: and as h&eacute;e approched therewith to the place of her presence, his sences were so rauished with the sight of her sweete face, that hee let the boale fall foorth of his handes: and reti|ryng backe with seemly shamefastnesse, went for more, and b&eacute;eing come therwith sh&eacute;e thanked him for his paines saying, I pray God that fall of the Wyne hinder not my winnyng and bryng m&eacute;e ill lucke, for I know many that connot away to haue Salt, or Drinke, or any sutch like thynge fall towardes them.</P>
<P>Madame saith <HI>Germanicus</HI> I haue often heard it dis|puted in schooles that sutch as the cause of euery thing is, sutch wilbe the effect, and s&eacute;eyng the cause of this chaunce was good, I doubt not but the effect wil folow accordyng|ly: and if any euill do insue therof I trust it will light on my head through whose negligence it happened. <HI>Agrip.</HI> answered. As I know not the cause, so I feare not the effect greatly, and in deed as you say hethervnto you haue had the worst of it, for that thereby you haue been put to double paynes.</P>
<P>If that b&eacute;e all (saith h&eacute;e) rather then it shalb&eacute;e sayd any euill to haue insued of this chaunce, I will perswade my selfe that euery payne whiche you shall put mee to, shalbe

double delight and treble pleasure vnto mee. You must vse (sayth shee then) great eloquence to your selfe to per|swade you to sutch an impossibility. Oh if it please you (sayth hee) there is an oratour which of late hath taken vp his dwelling within mee, who hath eloquence to per|swade mee to a far greater matter then this.</P>
<P>If (sayth shee) hee perswade you to thinges no more behouseful for your selfe then this, if you follow my coun|sayle, you shall not giue him house roome long. Madame (sayth hee) it is an assured signe of a free and freendly minde to giue good counsayle, but it is harde for one in bondage and out of his owne possession to followe it. For what knoweth your honour whether h&eacute;e haue already ta|ken intire possession of the house wherin h&eacute;e is, which if it bee so, what wit is able to deuise a writ to remoue him from thence? If sir (sayth sh&eacute;e) h&eacute;e entred by order of law and payd you truely for it, it is reason h&eacute;e inioy it, marie your folly was greate to retaine sutch a tenant, but if h&eacute;e intruded himselfe by force you may lawfully extrude him by strength.</P>
<P>In d&eacute;ede (sayth h&eacute;e) h&eacute;e entred <HI>vi et armis</HI> forcibly, but after vpon certaine parlance passed betw&eacute;ene vs, I was content h&eacute;e should remaine in peacible possession: marie hee hath payd mee nothinge yet, but hee promiseth so frankely that if the perfourmance follow, a house with beames of beaten golde, and pillers of precious stones will not counteruaile the price of it: yea if I were placed in quiet possession therof I would thinke my self ritcher, I wil not say then the Emperour, but which is most then god him selfe who possesseth heauen and earth: and as the hope of obtayning the effecte of that promise, heaueth mee vp to heauen, so the doubt to bee deceiued therof dri|ueth mee downe to hell.</P>
<P>And what ioyly fellow (sayth shee) is this that promi|seth so frankely, will h&eacute;e not promise golden hils and per|fourme durty dales? Would to god (sayth hee) your seme|ly
<PB N="41" REF="25">
selfe were so well acquainted with him as I am, then would I make you iudge of the worthynesse of the thinge hee hath promised, for that you know the goodnes thereof none better? The lady smellinge the drift of his deui|ses, and seeinge the ende of his talke seemed to tend to loue and that touching her owne selfe, thought not good to draw on their discourse any longer, but concluded with this answere.</P>
<P>As I am altogether ignorant what your obscure talke meaneth, so care I not to bee acquainted with any sutch companion as your Landlord is, for so methinkes by you I may more fitly call him, then terme him your tenaunt: and so departed away into her lodginge: <HI>Germanicus</HI> like|wise his Misteris beeing gone gat him to his chamber to entertaine his amarous conceites and b&eacute;eing alone brake forth into these wordes.</P>
<P>O friendly fortune if continually hereafter thou furi|ously frowne vpon m&eacute;e, yet shall I all the dayes of my life count my selfe bound vnto thee for the onely pleasure which this day thou hast done mee, in giuinge mee occasi|on of talke with her, whose aungels voice made sutch heauenly harmony to my heauy heart, that where before it was plunged in perplexity, it is now placed in felicity, and where before it was oppressed with care, it is nowe refreshed with comfort. Yea euery louely lookes of her is able to cure mee if I were in most deepe distres of moste daungerous disease, euery sweete woord proceeding from her sugred lips, is of force to fetch mee from death to life. But alas how true do I trie that saying, that euery com|modity hath a discommodity annexed vnto it, how dooth the remembraunce of this ioy, put mee in minde of the annoy which the losse of this delight will procure mee? Yea it maketh all my sences shake to thinke, that some other shall inioy her more woorthy of her then my selfe: and yet who in this court, nay in all Christendome, nay in the whole worlde is worthy of her? No if sh&eacute;e neuer
<PB N="42" REF="26">
haue any vntill sh&eacute;e haue one worthy of her euery way, shee shall neuer haue any. And shall I then beeing but a poore gentleman seeke to insinuate my selfe in place so high? Shall I by my rude attempt purchase at least the displeasure of her friendes and parentes, and perchaunce hers also, whom to displease would be no lesse displeasant vnto m&eacute;e then death? Alas and must loue needes bee re|warded with hate? Must curtesy n&eacute;edes b&eacute;e counteruay|led with crueltie? Must goodwil needes be returned with displeasure? Is it possible y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> bounti should not abide where beuty doth abou~d, &amp; that curtesy should not accompany her comlinesse? Yes I am sure at the least she wil suffer me to loue her, though her younge yeeres &amp; high estate will not suffer her to loue mee: &amp; though sh&eacute;e will not accept me for husband, yet I am sure shee will not reiecte m&eacute;e for ser|uaunt: and though shee will not receiue my seruice, yet I doubt not but shee will courteously take the tendringe therof vnto her. And touchinge her parentes displeasure, what care I to procure the ill will of the whole world, so I may purchase her good will. Yea if I should spend the most precious bloud in my body in the pursuite of so pere|les a p&eacute;ece, I would count it as welbestowed as if it were shed in the quarrell of god my prince or country. For sh&eacute;e is the goddesse whom I wil honour with deuotion, sh&eacute;e is the prince whom I will obey with duty, shee is the coun|try in whose cause and quarrell I will spend life, liuing, and all that I haue. Neither is there mutch cause why her friendes should storme much at the matter, for though my lands &amp; reuenewes are not great, yet am I of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> bloud royall, &amp; nere kinsman to themperour, who wil not suffer me to want any thing pertayning to my estate &amp; degree. Why <HI>Alerane,</HI> a youth like my self, practised the mightie emperour <HI>Otho</HI> his daughter &amp; darling <HI>Adalesia,</HI> stole her away &amp; married her, and do I sticke to attempt the like w^t one of far meaner estate, though of far more worthinesse? And though frowning fortune tossed him for a while in y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="43" REF="26">
tempestious seas of aduersiti, yet at y^e length he arriued at the hauen of happy estate, and was reconciled to the good grace and fauour of the Emperour againe. And though at the first my ship be shaken with angry blastes, yet in time I doubt not but to bee safely landed on the shore, and haue my share of that which the showres of shroad fortune shall keepe mee from. Hee is not worthy to sucke the sweete who hath not first sauored the sower. And as the beauty of a faire woman beeing placed by a foule, blaseth more brightly, so eche ioy is made more pleasant by first tasting some sower sops of sorrow. Did not the perill which <HI>Le|ander</HI> ventred in the sea, and the paine which hee tooke in swimming, make his arriuall to the hauen of his hea|uenly <HI>Hero</HI> more happy and pleasaunt? Yes no doubt of it, for besides the feelinge of the present pleasure, the re|memberance of the perill past delighteth. Beesides that by how mutch more a man hazardeth him selfe for his misteris sake, by so mutch the more hee manifesteth the constancy of his loue, and meriteth m&eacute;ede at her handes the more woorthily. This saying also is no lesse tried then true that fortune euer fauoureth the valiaunt, and things the more hard the more haughty, high, and heauenly: nei|ther is any thing hard to bee accomplished by him which hardily enterpriseth it.</P>
<P>With these and sutch like sayinges incouraginge him self, h&eacute;e purposed to pursue his purpose, and failed not dai|ly to attend vpon his Misteris withal dutie and diligence and sought all occasions hee could to let her vnderstande his loyall loue and great good wyll towardes her, which she perceiuing disdayned not acknowledge by her amia|ble and curtuous countinaunce towards him, wherewith he helde himselfe as well satisfied as if he had bene made Monarche of the whole world. And though he were often determined in woordes to present his sute vnto her, yet when it came to the poynt he shoulde haue spoken, feare of offending her altogether disappointed his purpose, and
<PB N="44" REF="27">
made him mute in the matter he minded to vtter, but at length perceiuing that delay bred danger, for that she had many other suters, and f&eacute;eling by experience, that as fire the more it is kept downe, the more it flameth vp, so loue the more he sought to suppresse him, the more fiery forces he expressed within him, he began to set feare aside and to force a supplye of courage in his faint harte, and seeing his Misteris sit in the presence alone, he entred into rea|soning with her in this manner.</P>
<P>Madame for that I s&eacute;e you without company I am the bolder to presume to preace in place, wherof though I be altogether vnworthy, yet am I altogether willing to sup|plye it, and if my companie may content you as well as your sight satisfieth mee, I doubte not but you will ac|cept it in good part: and so mutch the lesse I hope my com|pany shalbe combersome vnto you, for that you are busied about nothing wherto my presence may be preiudiciall. And verely when I consider the common cource of life which your sweete self, and other maides of your estate leade, methinkes it is altogether like the spendinge of your time at this present, which is with your leaue b&eacute;e it spoken, idly, vnfruitefully without pleasure or profit, and if my credite were sutch with you to craue credite for that which I shall speake, I would not doubt but to perswade you to another trade of life more commendable in the world, more honourable amongest all men, and more acceptable in the sight of god.

<P>God forbid (Madame saith he) you should continue your time in any such trifling trade of lyfe, which indeede is to be counted no lyfe at all, as the Grecian Ladies most truly testyfie, who (as <HI>Homer</HI> reporteth) count their age from the time of their marriage, not from the day of their birth: and if they be demaunded how olde they be, they begin to recken from their mariage and so answer accor|dingly. For then onely (say they) we begin to liue, when we haue a house to gouerne, and may commaunde ouer our children and seruants.</P>
<P>Tush (saith the Lady) this is but the sentence and pro|per opinion of one peculyer people, who perchaunce by the nature of their country, or otherwise are more desie|rus of husbands then other, neither is it any more reason that we should be tied to their example, the~ they be bound to follow our virgin <HI>Vestals</HI> or other, who consume the whole course of their life w^tout contaminating their corps with the company of men.

But to leaue perti|culer opinions, and come to generall constitutions and customes, I meane both naturall, humaine and deuine lawes, and you shall see them all to make agaynst you.

And in that some doe amisse in rebellinge against nature, their owne scrupulous nicenesse is the cause, when they will lay on them selues heauier burdens then they are able to beare, and refuse to beare those burthens whiche nature hath appointed them to beare: which are but light.</P>
<P>What talke you sir (sayth shee) so mutch of nature and of creatures without reason, as though wee ought to fol|low either the instinct of the one, either the example of the other. I haue bene alwayes taught that reason is the rule to direct our dooinges by, and that wee ought to laye b&eacute;efore vs the actions of creatures indued with reason to follow and imitate. For if you sticke so strictly to the ex|ample of reasonles creatures, you should vse the company of women but once or twice at the moste in the yeere, as most of them doo, with their females, whereto I am sure you would b&eacute;e loth to b&eacute;e tied.</P>
<P>Madame (sayth hee) a gentlewoman of this citie hath answerd this obiction alredy for me. Why then (saith she) wil you condemne their dooings in some poinctes, &amp; place

them for paternes to b&eacute;e practised by in othersome?</P>
<P>Yea why not (sayth h&eacute;e) otherwise you might general|ly take exception against the example of men, for that some men in some matters do amisse. The good euer is to bee vsed, and the ill refused. But to come to the dooings of men which you s&eacute;eme to desire, doth not euery man so soone as his daughter is arriued to ripe yeres, trauell to bestow her in mariage, wherby she may inioy the fruits of loue, &amp; participate with the pleasures incident to that estate: wherby they plainly shew that the cause why they begot them with pleasure, and bring them vp with pain, is to haue them enter into that trade of life, wherin not only themselues may liue happily abounding in all plea|sure, but also by the fertill fruite of their body, make their mortall parentes immortall: that when they with age shalb&eacute;e wasted and withered away the s&eacute;ede of their seede may begin gr&eacute;enely to grow and flowrishingly to spring, to the great comfort of both the father and daughter. For what pleasure the graundfather takes in the sportinge pastime of his proper daughters prety children, I thinke you partly vndersta~d, and what delight the mother takes in the toyes of her litle sonne, you soone shall perfectly perceiue, if it please you friendly to followe the friendly counsayle which I frankely preache vnto you. For do you thinke if virginity were of sutch vertue, that parentes would not rather paine them selues to keepe their deare daughters modest maides, then straine them selues and their substance to ioyne them in <HI>Iunos</HI> sacred bond? Yes perswade your sw&eacute;ete selfe if your mother were so per|swaded sh&eacute;e would rather locke you vp close in her closet, then suffer any to inioy the soueraigne sight of your beu|ty, or once aspire to your sp&eacute;eche whereby you might b&eacute;e perswaded to some other kinde of life. But sh&eacute;e experien|ced by y&eacute;eres knoweth best what is best for your behouse and would you should followe her example and make no conscience to loose that which sh&eacute;e her self hath lost, which

except sh&eacute;e had lost w&eacute;e had lost so rare a Iewell as your s&eacute;emely selfe are, with what a losse it had bene to my self I dare not say lest you count verity vanity, and truth trifling and flattery. But to our purpose, you perceiue as I sayd your parentes pleased with the accesse of gentle|men vnto you, wherby you may conceiue their minde is you should accept sutch seruice as they profer, and per|take with those pleasures which they prefer vnto you.</P>
<P>Why sir (sayth sh&eacute;e) you altogether mistake the mea|ning of men in this matter, for when fathers te~der mari|ages to their daughters, it is not for any minde they haue to haue them maried, but onely for feare least they should fall to folly otherwayes, for knowing the fickle frailenesse of youth, and our procliuyty to prauity and wickednesse, they prouide vs mariages to preuent mischiefes: and s&eacute;e|inge of euils the least is to b&eacute;e chosen, they count mariage a lesse euill then lightnesse of our life and b&eacute;ehauiour.</P>

<P>Sir (saith she) I speake it not of my self, but according to the opinion of the most wise and learned Philosophers that euer liued, amongest whom one <HI>Aminius</HI> so mutche misliked of Marriage, that b&eacute;eyng demaunded why hee would not marrie, answered, because there were so ma|nie inconueniences incident to that estate, that the least of them is able to slea a thousande men.</P>

But to leaue naturall &amp; humaine lawes and come to the deuine precepts proceedyng from Gods owne mouth: doth not God say it is not good for man to liue alone, and therefore made <HI>Eue</HI> for an helper and com|forter? Likewise in diuers places of Scripture he doth not only commend Marriage to vs, saying, Marriage and the bed vndefiled are honourable, but also commaundeth vs to it, saying: you shall forsake Father and Mother and follow your wiues.</P>
<P>Why sir (saith shee) and doth not God say it is good for man not to touche a woman, and if thou bee vnmarried remayne so. But why alleadge you not this text, it is better to marrie then to burn, wherby is playnly shewed that Marriage is but a meane to medicine the burnynge in concupiscence and lust, and as I sayd b&eacute;efore of two e|uils the least, and therfore preferred. But because wee bee entred into deuine misteries, I could refer you to a place of scripture, where it is reported that in Heauen Uirgins ch&eacute;eifly serue God and set foorth his glorie. And <HI>Mahamet</HI> the great Turke (who was in heauen) saith he saw there Uirgins, who if they issued foorth of Heauen would lighten the whole worlde with their brightnesse, and if they chaunced to spit into the sea, they would make the whole water as sweet as Honie, but here is no men|tion of married folke.</P>
<P>Belike (saith h&eacute;e) those Uyrgins bee like your self, and then no meruayle though God be delighted with the sight of them, whiche perchaunce is the cause hee hath them in Heauen to attend vpon him, as first <HI>Heue</HI> and after <HI>Ga|nymedes</HI> did vpon Iupiter. But generally of women the scripture sayth that by bringinge forth of children they shalb&eacute;e saued and inioy a place in heauen, which must b&eacute;e by mariage if honestly.

<P>I b&eacute;es&eacute;eche you good father not to thinke mee so grace|lesse a child as once to thinke, mutchlesse to do any thing whiche may heape your heauinesse or hasten your death, the least of whiche two, would bee more bitter vnto mee then death.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe aunciet Ppilosophers are of this mynde, that there is nothyng that doth more argue and shew a base mynde, then couetous desire of coyne &amp; rit|ches, and nothyng more signe of a noble heart, then not to desire wealth if one want it, and liberally to bestow it, if h&eacute;e haue it. But I am of this minde, that nothynge doth more argue a mad minde, then to desire goods which ne|uer did good, but which haue been alwayes the cause of all our calamities. What a world of men hath desire of wealth wasted in war? What huge heapes hath it drow|ned in the Sea? What infinite numbers hath it caused Phisitions to kill? How many hath it mooued Lawiers to vndoe? How many hath it driuen Deuines to sende to the Diuell? Of how many Murthers, thefts, flaugh|ters, parricides, patricides, treasons, rebellions, periu|ries, forgeries, adultries, fornications, hath it been the cause? As Iupiter himselfe abused golde and pelfe to a|buse <HI>Danae</HI> that virgin. But you will say though the desire of goods bee detestable, yet the possession is profita|ble. Wherto I pray you? to maintayne vs in brauery, in gluttony, in venery, in securitie, in impunitie, in pride, in
<PB N="65" REF="37">
prodigalitie, yea to brynge vs to perdition and distruction as kynge <HI>Midas</HI> wished that euery thynge which h&eacute;e tou|ched might bee gold, wherby h&eacute;e was starued to death.</P>
<P><HI>Fabritius</HI> an auncient <HI>Romain</HI> waighed wealth so litle, that though h&eacute;e had b&eacute;en Prince and Consul of <HI>Rome</HI> three or foure times, yet at his death h&eacute;e had not so mutch goods as might suffice to bring him honorably to his graue, but was faine to b&eacute;e buried at the common charge of the citie. But though the immoderate desire of ritches b&eacute;e to b&eacute;e reprehended, yet must I n&eacute;edes say that moderately to account of them is not b&eacute;e misliked, for they are giuen vs by God to passe the pilgrimage of our life withall, and we may vse them and yet not abuse them, w&eacute;e may make of them and yet not make our Goddes of them. And as by duely desiryng and truly vsyng them, they conuert to our commoditie, so by gr&eacute;edy couetinge and naughtie consu|myng them, they turne to our trouble, care, and confu|sion: as partly b&eacute;efore hath b&eacute;en shewed, and plainly here after by the hystorie folowing is prooued, which is this.</P>
<P>In <HI>Greece</HI> amongst the people called <HI>Argiues</HI> dwelt one <HI>Amphiaraus,</HI> who b&eacute;eyng a man of great possessions and wealth, heard of a Widdow in the same country of like liuyng vnto him selfe, her name was <HI>Eriphile,</HI> and her na|ture was sutch, that sh&eacute;e thought gaine sw&eacute;et how so euer sh&eacute;e got it. It fortuned this Gentleman to come to her house to s&eacute;e and assay her in the way of Marriage, and not withstandyng h&eacute;e had more likyng to the liuyng then wil to the woman, yet h&eacute;e laboured his sute as ernestly, as if h&eacute;e had loued vehemently: and at conuenient time com|menced his sute in this sort.</P>
<P>Gentlewoma~ I think it not n&eacute;edful to enter into termes in commendation of mariage therby to perswade you the sooner therto, for that you know the dignity thereof, and haue already tasted the pleasures and commodities b&eacute;e|longinge to the same: but this chiefelye lieth m&eacute;e vpon earnestly to perswade, and humbly to requeste at your
<PB N="66" REF="38">
handes, that when it shalb&eacute;e your good pleasure to enter into that life againe, you will count mee worthy (though altogether vnworthy) to serue you in steede of a steward to order and dispose your thinges as your seemely selfe shall please to appointe, and to ease you of the trouble of trauailinge in your owne affaires: which I am sure for that you haue not beene accustomed thereto, must needes mutch molest you. For it is not m&eacute;ete your young yeres should b&eacute;e tied to any trouble or trauaile, but to passe your time in pleasure according to your bringinge vp and cal|linge, and accordinge to the custome of your kinde, and sexe. And that you may not thinke my sute to proc&eacute;ed of any desire to your goods, your selfe I thinke partly know and by litle inquiry may perfectly vnderstande, that my landes and liuinges are sufficient to maintaine the port and countenance of a Gentleman of worship: all which I willingly yeeld into your handes to b&eacute;e disposed at your pleasure, if it shall please you to y&eacute;eld your body into my armes to b&eacute;e imbraced at my pleasure: so y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in acceptinge my offer you shall not only increase your substance, but also haue a gentleman at your commaundement, who shall make more account of you then of all the goods in the world. His talke ended <HI>Eriphile</HI> smylinge made him this smooth answere.</P>
<P>Sir, by how mutch more I know the inconueniences and infinite troubles mixed with mariage, by so mutch lesse do I like to enter into that estate againe. And as I was once linked with one according to my liking, so looke I not to bee placed againe with any, in whom I can take sutch pleasure: And as by holy oth I firmely bounde my fayth vnto him, so in this minde I am in, only my death shal dissolue that bond: and y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sower remembrance of my sweete husbandes death, shall take away the renewinge of all pleasures of life, and altogether mortifie in m&eacute;e the minde to marry any more. For his loue was so exc&eacute;eding great towardes mee, that I feare to finde the like at your
<PB N="67" REF="38">
handes or any mans els. For where you professe to be my steward and seruant, I am sure if you were once sure of that you seeke for, you would thinke your selfe good i|nough to bee my Lord and maister, and you would dispose my goods neither at my pleasure, neither to my profite, but that which is mine should b&eacute;e yours and yours your owne. And where you pretend to prefer mee before al worldly goods, I take it rather for wordes of course then talke of troth, for as in the fayrest rose is soonest found a kanker, so in fairest sp&eacute;ech is falshood and faigning rifest. For I knowe the fashion of you men is by your subtelty to deceiue our simplicity, and by a fewe filed woordes to bring vs into a fooles paradise. Yea you haue set it down as a setled sentence amongst you, that he which knoweth not how to dissemble, knoweth not how to liue. Therfore I y&eacute;eld no other faith to your wordes then their faygned falshoode deserues, nor no other consent to your requeste, then the smal acquaintance you haue with m&eacute;e, may iust|ly craue. But if hereafter in d&eacute;edes I shall see as playne proufe of perfect goodwill, as your wordes import likely|hood of ernest loue, perchaunce I shal b&eacute;e as zelous to cast liking towardes you, as now I am ielous to cast doubtes of you. By this time dinner was serued in, wherevpon their talke ceased, and presently after dinner the Gentle|man had occasion to depart. Now <HI>Eriphile</HI> beeinge a|lone in her own house, b&eacute;egan to discourse vpon this mat|ter by her selfe, and notwithstandinge shee had no great minde to the man, yet shee felt in her selfe a great lust to his landes, and thought her selfe more then happy if shee might haue them safely assured and made ouer vnto her: and in this thought, vttred wordes to this sence.</P>
<P>Why what though I can not finde in my heart to loue and like him aboue all other. Is it requisite that euery mariage b&eacute;e grounded on loue, as though we see not daily some to marry in respect of ritches, some in respecte of ho|nours, some by constraint of freindes, &amp; some vpon sundri
<PB N="68" REF="39">
other considerations: and for my parte I count it suffici|ent to haue married once of meere loue&punc; and hauinge lost him whom I did loue intirely, I thinke it not lawfull, or at least not possible, euer to loue any againe hartely. For true loue euer decayeth, when the party truly b&eacute;eloued dieth. And as my heart is hardened to take his death paciently, so will it not bee mollified to suffer the loue of any other to sinke therein d&eacute;epely. Like as the potters clay beeing once hardened in the Ouen, will not bee made soft againe to receiue the impression of any o|ther forme. But to speake my fancy freely, I see not how wee women are bound to loue our husbandes so mutch, wee are onely commaunded to honour and obay them, which I count sufficiente, and more then for my part I meane to perfourme. Besides that loue consisteth in the heart, now it is our bodies only that are bound to our hus|bandes as by ioyning of handes b&eacute;efore the congregation is plainely shewed. But if I determine not to loue him, how can I looke for any loue at his handes? Tush that is the least matter amongest a hundred, so long as I may abound in brauery, ruffle in ritches, and participate with his goods, I care not to communicate in loue with him: I am to olde now to liue by loue. And yet wherefore is womens wit counted full of wyles, if I bee not able so to dissemble the matter that hee maye thinke I loue him deepely, though I hate him deadly. But if it should come to the woorst, that hee should perceiue my dissembling to|wardes him, and reward my colde kindenesse, with heate of hate, why I know the worst of it.</P>
<P>So that all things considered I see not how I can doe better then to accept this gentlemans offer, whose large landes and reuenewes are able to supplie al other wants whatsoeuer. For what disease is so desperate which mo|ny may not medicine? what wound so deadly which coine can not cure? What life so lothsome which goods can not make gladsome? Shortly after this there made repayre

vnto her house&punc; a youth more wilfull then wise, named <HI>Infortunio,</HI> who hauinge seene her once or twice beefore, was so bleared with her beauty that it dazeled his sight, and tooke away his foresight in all things: and comming to her presence h&eacute;e proferred sutch lamentable sute, and ghostly resemblances vnto her, that a rigorous repulse s&eacute;emed sufficient to procure him a present death. The Gentlewoman seeing the furious assaultes of this freshe water souldiour, knew how to traine him to the fielde of her falshood, and to make him march vnder the ensigne of a marciles Misteris and cruell captaine: and sometimes fed him with wordes of comfort, to put him in hope, and by and by feared him with doubtes of deniall, to driue him into dispaire. And as the North East winde first gathereth vp the cloudes, and then by puffes putteth them abroade agayne, so shee first by louely lookes allured to bringe him in, and then with frowninge face lowred to driue him away: the only end beeing to sport her selfe in his paine, yea and if sh&eacute;e could of his good will to make some gaine. The poore gentleman perceiuinge these haggard trickes, and that assone sh&eacute;e would be wel com|ming to the lure, and by and by checke at it and soare a|way, was so amazed ther at that h&eacute;e knew not what to re|solue vpon. And as a tr&eacute;e hewen round with axes rea|dy to fall with a blowe or twaine&punc; tottereth euery way, b&eacute;eing vncertaine which way to fall&punc; so his minde distrac|ted with doubtfull deuises, wauered vnconstanly, nowe bending this way, now bowing that way, willing to re|tire his desire, but not able to set his fancy fr&eacute;e. And not with standinge her peruerse dealinge pitifully perplexed and terribly tormented him, yet h&eacute;e perswaded himselfe that as from most sharpe thornes, to wit the Rose tree, spring most sw&eacute;ete flowers, so from bitter annoy would come pleasaunt ioy, and of his heauy sute happy successe. Tush (saith h&eacute;e) y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Merchant often sliceth the seas, though not sure to returne with gaine. The souldiour often

Yes nothing venter nothing haue, I wil pursue my purpose whatsoeuer come of it.</P>
<P>Now the gentlewoman (as I sayd) ceased not to bayte him continually with courtly banquets, as dissembled fa|uour, vncertaine hope, curteous congies, amiable lookes and sutch like: but h&eacute;e on the contrary as one that ment truly, ceased not to feed her with faire words, with faith|full promises, with ernest othes, with many a ritch iewel and costly gifte, which sh&eacute;e willingly receiued without condition, and wilyly kept with out restitution. In this meane while came the other wooer againe to renew his sute a freshe, and s&eacute;einge this younge Gentleman, as h&eacute;e thought in great fauour, began greatly to feare his owne part, and thought the grasse had bene cut from vnder his f&eacute;ete: and as a conning <HI>Pilot</HI> s&eacute;eing the seas rough and the winde contrary to his course, casteth ancker least his ship b&eacute;e driuen against the rockes, or into some coast contrary to his minde: so this Gentleman fearinge least wilfull waues in y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> gentlewoman, should set her fast in the sands of slipper subtelty, and dash his sute against the rockes of repulse, hauld in the maine shete of her minde, and by the anckers of aduise so stayed her course, that no wynde which my wilfull youthe could blow, could cause her any thinge to bow or wauer: and by assuringe her to a large ioynter h&eacute;e was chosen to rule her sterne, wher the other was kept stil vnder the hatches. Who all this while that they were concluding the contracte, was in his chaumber busily deuisinge verses in the praise of his Misteris: but hearing of the sory successe of his sute, by a handmaide of the Gentlewoman, h&eacute;e was so confounded in him selfe, that his inuencion was cleane marred, and his deuise vt|terly dasht: yea h&eacute;e was so far from writinge that h&eacute;e had

not a woord to saye or a thought to thinke. And surely in my iudgment h&eacute;e reaped the right reward of his doatinge desire, for there only grafts of greife must n&eacute;edes grow, where sutch raw conceite doth set, and sutch rashe consent dooth sowe. For neyther was his loue grounded vpon ver|tue, wherwith shee was not indued, neither vpon beauty wherwith shee was not adorned. For neither can cruel|ty be cloaked vnder vertue, neither the treason of vntruth couered vnder beuty (for the disposition of the minde fol|loweth the constitucion of the body) so that it was his own selfe will and fond fancy that drewe him into sutch depth of affection, and therefore with greife was faigne to ga|ther the fruites of his folly. And beeing come to him selfe hee began to rage in this sort.</P>
<P>And is my true loue thus triflyngly accounted of? Shall h&eacute;e with his trash more preuayle then I with my truth? And will sh&eacute;e more respect gayne then good will?

<P>ICILIVS a younge Gentleman of Rome, fallynge in loue with <HI>Virginia,</HI> is refused by her friendes for want of suffi|cient wealth, but priuily contracteth himselfe vnto her, and departeth into the warres. <HI>Appius Claudius</HI> burning with vnchaste lust of the same mayden, the better to ob|tayne her, causeth <HI>Clodius</HI> his client to clayme her for his bondslaue, and giueth wrongfull iudgement on his side. But <HI>Virginius</HI> her father, at her ernest request, slayeth her with his owne handes to preserue her virginitie from the villainie of <HI>Appius,</HI> who for that fact is cast into prison, where desperatly hee doth himself to death.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is a doubt often debated but not yet decided, whether loue discendeth from the heauens, deriueth of our owne nature, proc&eacute;edeth of the similitude of manners, com|meth of acquaintance and familiarity, taketh originall of our education and bringinge vp together, whether it ariseth of beauty or of vertue, whether it entreth in at the eyes, or first b&eacute;e rooted in the hart, whether the cause come from the party that loueth or the party loued, or whether it b&eacute;e in our power to loue or to leaue, I leaue to other to resolue vpon, for for my part (I yeeld god thankes for it) I haue as yet been so litle troubled with loue, that I know not what it is, nor from whence it commeth, and when I muse theron I am as bad troubled as Symonides was to thinke and say what god was: but if an opinion grounded vpon reason without any proper experience on mine owne part may take place, I thinke loue cheifly to bee grounded vpon the similitude of manners shewed and signified by familiarity and abode together. For it is dai|ly seene that those parties who at the first incountry and vew haue rather dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iked then loued ech other, by continu|ance of conuersation and by conferring eche others condi|tions
<PB N="81" REF="45">
and nature together, haue fallen into the fire of most feruent affection. For true loue and faythful freind|ship is to will and to nill one thinge, to haue one obiect of appetite, and to haue like effect of affection. I know there are infinite instances to bee giuen to this assertion, for that some haue beene surprised with loue only vpon a lo|uing looke, some vpon a curteous word, some vpon a sin|gle sight, some vpon a vaine vision, some vpon a doubtful dreame, some vpon an vncertaine report, and some some other way. But as one swallow makes not sommer, so one particularity concludeth no generality. And as an <HI>Aethiopian</HI> is sayd generally to b&eacute;e blacke though his t&eacute;eth b&eacute;e white, for that for the most partes of him hee is black, so I thinke loue may bee sayd generally to proc&eacute;ede of the similitude of manners, for that for the most part it doth so. And besides infinite other examples which I can al|leage for proofe hereof, the historie which you shal present|ly heare shall also confirme it.</P>
<P>In the renowmed citie of <HI>Rome</HI> made his abode one <HI>Icilius,</HI> who though h&eacute;e were a gentleman of a worshipful house, yet by reason that his parentes were yet lyuinge, his patrimony was not great, neither his liuinge more then might suffice to maintaine the porte of the place and countenance h&eacute;e caried in the citie, by reason wherof hee remained vnmaried, as b&eacute;eing not able to maintayne a wife accordinge to the estate of his callinge. It was his chaunce amongest other youthfull company to passe the time for the space of a sennight in feasting and makinge merry at the house of one <HI>L. Virginius,</HI> a worshipful gen|tleman of the same citie, who had to daughter a damsell named <HI>Virginia,</HI> who as sh&eacute;e was of ripe yeres, so was sh&eacute;e of ripe iudgement and discretion in euery point bee|longinge to a vertuous virgin &amp; modest maide. Her shape though it were not precise, yet was it perfecte: her face though it were not blasinge, yet was it beautifull: her corps though it were not curious, yet was it comely: and
<PB N="82" REF="46">
as nature plentifully planted perfection in her, so God super aboundantly bestowed his benefits vpon her, sutch grauity in gesture, sutch modesty in manners, sutch cur|tesy in conuersation, sutch troth in talke, sutch wit in reasoning, that <HI>Minerua</HI> her selfe could not haue mended her: that it was doutfull whether men were more rapte into admiration of her wisdome, or rauished in contem|plation of her beauty, the one contayninge contentment for the body, the other solace and delight for the minde. Now <HI>Icilius</HI> being in the company and society of this saint vsed litle other behauiour towardes her aboue his com|mon regard to all the Gentlewomen of the troupe, but spent his time in dauncinge, dysinge, cardinge, and other sutch pastimes. And notwithstanding this while he often felt a certaine restraint of liberty in his affections, an al|teration of minde and as it were a ciuell assault and dis|cord within him selfe, yet by reason of his younge yeres and small practise in the pangues of loue, hee could not coniecture the cause of his sodaine passions: but this made him most to muse, that when hee was in his most dumps, if shee chaunced to present her selfe to his presence, his heart was presently lightned of that which lay so heauy in his stomake, and as when the sun shineth the cloudes vanish away, so when her beauty blazed in place, the cloudes of care were cleare consumed. Likewise beeinge often desirous to talke with her, &amp; inioy the present plea|sure of her pleasant speeche, his sences were so rauished with the sight of her, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> he could not vtter one word vnto her. Sitting also at the table with her &amp; casting a gazinge glaunce round about him, his sight was neuer satisfied vntill hee had lent her a looke, and s&eacute;emed only to resolue his fancy vpon her face. But notwithstandinge all this hee did not thorowly perceiue the cause of his sodain trou|ble of minde, and thought it as it was a toy lightly taken so would it b&eacute;e lightly left againe, and therfore departed from her fathers house without preferring any sute vnto

But beeinge gone home, and gotten solitarily to his chamber, good god what mountaines of smooke did scaldinge sighes send foorth of his mouth, what drops of bloud did galdinge greife make his heart to bl&eacute;ed, what flouddes of teares did flow from his eyes, what carefull complaints did h&eacute;e send vnto the skies? saying O heauens why heape you my heauinesse?

And may I terme it bondage to liue in the seruice and contemplation of my <HI>Virginia?</HI> Is it slauery to b&eacute;e thrall to vertue? It is her bountie not her beutie that bindeth m&eacute;e, it is her curtesy, not her comlinesse that I care for, it is her perfection not her person that I passe of, it is her condi|ditions not her colour that I acount of: for beuty bideth not, comelinesse continueth not, personage perisheth, coulour fadeth, but bounty, curtesie, perfection, and con|ditions remaine for euer. So that if I liue in bondage, it is to vertue, if I b&eacute;e a slaue I am vertues slaue. But doth vertue vse to torment men thus, b&eacute;elike that is the cause there are so few honest and vertuous? No I ought not to count my trouble a torment, but the fine gold must

O happy was <HI>Endymion,</HI> who longe time inioyed the like sleepe. O ten times happie are the dead, if death b&eacute;e any thynge like this sleepe. But O hundred times vnhappie am I, to whom wakyng is waylefull, wheras to all thynges els it is ioyfull. But was this but a vision which deluded mee? was it but a dreame whiche I doated on? And if it were but a dreame, doth it portend nothyng? and may there be effect in dreames? Yea god wot commonly the contrary: or (as <HI>Cato</HI> saith) w&eacute;e s&eacute;e sleeping that which w&eacute;e wish for wakyng. So that neither in dreaming nor doing, neither in sleepyng nor s&eacute;eyng, neither in thinkyng nor sayinge,
<PB N="86" REF="48">
finde I any cause of comfort or see any signe of solace. This youthe passed his time so longe in these and sutch like passions, that y^e carefull cariage of his eyes bewrayed his carefull minde, and his pale countenance his painfull case. Which a special fr&eacute;end of his perceiuyng, tooke sutch compassion and pitie on his painfull state, that h&eacute;e sought all meanes possible to sift out the cause of his sorrow, to the intent to s&eacute;eke some medicine for his maladie. And hauyng oportunitie of time and place, h&eacute;e brake with him in this sorte.</P>
<P>Good freende, if I should shew you what great sorrow I sustayne by your heauinesse, you would perchaunce iudge my words to proceede rather of flattery and trifling then of truth: but no more but trie how willyng I wilbe to ease your payne, and by that iudge how greatly it gr&eacute;e|ueth mee. But how great so euer my gr&eacute;eif bee, my won|der is more then great to s&eacute;e you transfourmed from the estate of a pleasant Gentleman into sutch solitarie re|gardes, that you s&eacute;eme rather a <HI>Tymon</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> then a courtier of <HI>Italy:</HI> and so mutche the more cause I haue of meruayle, by how mutch lesse I s&eacute;e any apparent cause which should worke any sutch alteration in you. For if want of worldly wealth coulde worke your woe, why you want nothyng: if you would eate golde (as they say) you might haue it. If losse of freendes molest you, why you haue an infinite number whiche loue you intirely. If you bee disposed to trauayle to see straunge countries, your parents wilbee well pleased with your departure. If you bee wearie of your single life, your freendes will foorth|with prouide for your Marriage. If any repulse receyued of any dayntie dame doo daunt you, why the Goddes them selues haue suffred the like: as <HI>Daphne</HI> a seely damsel re|fused the God <HI>Phoebus: Syrinx</HI> a simple mayde reiected the God <HI>Pan,</HI> with infinite other. If you haue fixed your fancie in place you thinke impossible to possesse, why you haue reason to rule your affection, you haue wit to com|passe
<PB N="87" REF="48">
your desire, you haue fr&eacute;ends to further it, you want nothynge to finish it. With this his colour beegan to chaunge, and hee fetcht a deepe sighe or two, whereby his freend perceiued hee had touched the cause of his calami|tie, and sore of his sorrow, praying him very ernestly to vnfolde the secrets of his thoughtes vnto him, sayinge two wittes are better then one, and that which you blin|ded perchaunce by loue can not see, I stirred vp by desire to doo you good, may perceiue. And for secrecy in your af|faires, assure your selfe, that neuer <HI>Pithias</HI> to his <HI>Damon, Pylades</HI> to his <HI>Orestes,</HI> nor <HI>Gys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ppus</HI> to his <HI>Titus</HI> was more true, then I will bee to you. And though your learninge and wit to knowe what is best for your owne behalfe bee far better then mine, yet the simplenesse of my wit shalbee supplied with the sincerenesse of my will, which shalbe alwayes so ready prest to pleasure you, that if my seruice may satisfie you, you shall commaund mee, if my company may content you, I will neuer be out of your sight: if I may any way stand you in any steede, ac|count mee your owne only.</P>
<P><HI>Icilius</HI> hearing this friendly discourse could not but say in his heart, O friend vnfained, O loue most loyall, O curtesy incomparable and imbracinge fast his freend in his armes sayd, if al the miseries in the world did muster in multitudes about mee, yet this thing only is of force to fence mee from their furies, to thinke I inioy so firme a friend as your selfe are, and if I may liue but to requite some part of your good wil, it is the second felicity I loke for in this life. But touching the cause of my perplexity I must craue pardon if I make courtsy to disclose it, for that many euils cary this nature, rather to bee concealed with griefe, then reuealed in hope of releife. And as a greene wound by taking the aire spredeth farther abroad and is the hardlier healed, so I thinke my tormente and greife beeinge once discouered, would not bee so easely cured. If (sayth his frend) the originall of your euil pro|ceede
<PB N="88" REF="49">
of loue as in my fancy it doth, then vndoubtedly the more it is vncouered the sooner is it cured, for as coales of fire couered cloase with ashes keepe their heate longe time, but lying open soone waxe colde and blacke, so the firy flames of loue raked vp in silence, burne furiously within a man, but b&eacute;einge by discourse disclosed they soone conuert from flame to fume and smoake. Wherefore (good freinde) sticke not to imparte vnto m&eacute;e this matter which doth import you so nere, promising you by the in|uiolable bond of freindship to trauaile so ernestly in your affaires, that what wanteth in power, you shall finde in the paines which I will take in your cause. Alas sw&eacute;et freind (saith <HI>Icilius</HI>) rather then you should thinke I haue any diffidence or distrust in you, or thinke you vnwoorthy of credite in any cause whatsoeuer, I will make you pri|uy to the cause of my paine what pange or perill so euer I incur therby. Wherefore you shal vnderstand that since the time I was at the house of <HI>L. Virginius,</HI> as you part|ly know, the conditions of his daughter did so well con|tent m&eacute;e, her nature agr&eacute;ed so well with mine, her affec|tions were so framed to my fancy, that I am constrained to resigne my liberty captiue vnto her, and to make her person the prison of my hart. And the lesse hope I haue of obtayning her, the more doo I loue: and the more d&eacute;epely I doo desire her, the more deadly doo I dispaire of her: which is the cause of all my care and summe of all my so|row: yea this is it which hath made mee an enemie to my selfe, a straunger to my freindes, to abandon all good company, to sit in solitarinesse, and this is it which, if it b&eacute;e not in time prouided for, will preuente by death all other mischeifs. God forbid good freind (sayth his freind) that so light a cause should so d&eacute;epely distres you: what, doo you thinke either so superstitiously of her, either so abiect|ly of your selfe, that you deeme this matter so impossible to bee brought to passe? Why her person is not of sutch perfection, but that yours may match it: her freindes are
<PB N="89" REF="49">
not of sutch state, but that yours may stand by them: her portion is not so greate, but your parentes are able to make yours equall vnto it. No, doubt not but your loue shall sort to lucky ende, and haue sutch successe you seeke for: and I am hartely glad, that seeinge it was your chaunce to loose your liberty, it is lodged in sutch a place, which is rather to b&eacute;e counted a Paradise of pleasure, the~ a prison of paine, of whose worthynes I would somwhat say, but that perchaunce you will thinke mee partiall to the party, and besides that I should rather kindle newe coales in you, then quench olde flames. But bicause I perswade my selfe I may doe somewhat with the partie which putteth you to this paine, doubt not to commit this charge to mee, and I warrant you I will discharge it to your contentation. Ah deare freind (sayth <HI>Icilius</HI>) if I thought you as well able to giue order to my sorrow and redresse my woe, as I see you willing to comfort my care|fulnesse and keepe mee from dispaire, I should thinke my self the happiest wight in the world, and I would account of you as the preseruer of my life, but I can not tell what the matter is, m&eacute;ethinkes the more feruent is my fire, the more faint is my feare. Phy (sayth his freind) you shew your selfe to very a coward, fortune you knowe fa|uoureth not the faint hearted, neither are they woorthy to win the pray you presse for, and therefore for shame take a good heart vnto you, and doe your indeuour, and let mee alone with the rest: there is no hauke soareth so highe but shee will stoupe to some praye, neither any so rammishe and wilde but in time shee may bee reclaimed and made to the lure. And if you follow my aduise, I think good you solicite her by letters vntill sutch time you haue conuenient time to goe thither your selfe. Which coun|sayle hee forthwith put in execution, and indited a letter to his Mistris in this manner.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Good Mistris, to set foorth in woordes the feruency of my affection, &amp; vehemency of my passion, I thinke would
<PB N="90" REF="50">
be both tedious to you, and I am sure greeuous to my self for that the remembraunce of my passions would bee as it were a renewing of my paine, and though I altogether vse silence therein, yet the lothsome life which I leade, may by report aduertise you of my lucklesse loue, and my drousy lookes to all which see them, are signes sufficient of my drouping heart. Therfore may it please you plain|ly to vnderstand, that beeinge at Mayster <HI>Virginius</HI> your fathers house, I receiued sutch contentation in your company and sight, that since I haue bene depriued ther|of, I thinke my selfe depriued of all the pleasures of life: And onlesse your curtesy surmounte my desertes, and that you vouchsafe to pity my painfull estate, I shal haue iust cause to say, that at your fathers I receiued in st&eacute;ede of meate misery, for drinke dolour, yea I may count my fare fire, and my ch&eacute;ere very d&eacute;ere which must cost mee no lesse then the losse of my liberty at least. But if yet at the last course it shall please you to send and serue in to the table of my troubled minde some confectes of comfort with the fruites of freindship, I shall thinke my selfe to haue fared most daintily, wheras otherwise I shall count my selfe intreated disdainfully. Looke not good Mistris to my liuyng but to my loue, way not my wealth but my will, marke not my mony but my meaning in the way of honest and lawfull mariage, and sp&eacute;edily send the messen|ger of present consolation to him, which pineth away in paine and is yours only and euer:  <HI>ICILIVs.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Virginia</HI> hauinge vewed this letter, and likinge it ne|uer the worse for his sake that sent it, replied vnto it in this short and sober sort.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Sir, bicause I knowe in my selfe no sutch due desert any way, to driue you to sutch d&eacute;epe desire, I am the hard|lyer induced to bel&eacute;eue your wordes, and though I adhi|bited full credite vnto them, yet perchaunce as yet my fancy is not fully framed to like so well of you as you ey|ther desire or deserue: and though I coulde finde in my
<PB N="91" REF="50">
heart to like you aboue all other, yet I know not whether my freindes will yeeld their consent therto. So that it is in m&eacute;e only to thanke you for your goodwil, but not to sa|tisfie your request. Yours as shee may: <HI>VIRGINIA.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter bringinge some comforte to his carefull mimde, made him make hast to repaire in person to the place of her presence, where hee presented her his sute with sutch assured signes of perfect loue and loyalty, that shee thought with good conscience sh&eacute;e could not contemne his good will. But her parentes for that hee was not able, his father b&eacute;eing aliue to make her sutch ioynter as they inioyned him to, deferred the consummation of the mari|age from time to time, hopinge that time would mortifie the affection of either the one or the other louer. But as the smith his forge by casting on colde water burneth more fiercely, so their loue by these delayes increased more vehemently, which caused them to betroth them|selues eche to other. But <HI>Icilius</HI> indued with a couragi|ous minde, perceiuinge the lacke of liuinge to hinder his happinesse, determined to goe to the warres and by dint of sworde to win either coine or credite, or to loose life and loue. And b&eacute;einge on point to take his iourney h&eacute;e gaue his Misteris this farewell. If euer woful creature had cause to complayne his carefull case, then vndoubtedly may I duely preace for the formost place. The horse now and then ceaseth from his trauaile, the Asse from bearing the Oxe from drawing, and so of all other creatures, but my poore heart is neuer at rest, but as the wheele conti|nually turneth, so my minde continually tosseth, still de|uising how I may aspire to the ende of my desires, and b&eacute;e placed in full possession of your perfecte person. And hauing reuolued many wayes in my minde, I am now resolued vpon this to goe to the warres and there to win with prowesse and payn, that which god and fortune haue denied mee: where the remembraunce of your s&eacute;emely selfe shall arme m&eacute;e with sutch courage, that I shall count
<PB N="92" REF="51">
nothing daungerous to attempt or hard to attaine. And whatsoeuer woorthy feates you shall heare I shall enter|prise, I shall desire you to perswade your selfe that they are done for your sake. And if in my absence it shal please you to continue constant in goodwill towardes m&eacute;e, it is the onely shield that shall shadowe m&eacute;e in field and fight. Remember <HI>Penelope</HI> passed twenty y&eacute;eres in the absence of her <HI>Vlisses,</HI> and assure your selfe <HI>Vlisses</HI> neuer hazarded him selfe in more perils, then I will put my selfe to for your sake.</P>
<P><HI>Virginia</HI> hauing heard this short and sower discourse, castinge her selfe into his armes, after sh&eacute;e had beedewed his face with the teares which fell from her eyes, replied in this sort.</P>
<P>Ah <HI>(Maister Icilius)</HI> my tounge is not able to tell the hurt which my hart sustayneth by the couetous cruelty of my parentes, who in a gr&eacute;edy desire of goods, go about to stay mee from that wherevpon my life doth stay and de|pende, and were it not that your great curtesie and loue towardes mee did somwhat moderate and mitigate my martirdome, I should neuer bee able to beare the vnsup|portable burthen therof. But now I vnderstande by you I shall lose your companie, which was my only comforte and consolation, what resteth for mee, but notwithstan|dinge I was neuer married, yet to continue and leade a wofull widowes lothsome life, and to spende my golden y&eacute;eres in galdynge greeife. I could rehearse vnto you, and you your selfe can better tell, the infinite and immi|nent perils which alwayes wayte on warre, but that I doubt therby I should rather increase your gr&eacute;eif, then al|ter your determination, but this request at least, yea and perchaunce the last, let m&eacute;e make vnto you, that in warre you be warie, in battaile rather to backward then to bolde in field rather to flying then to forwarde, and if you take no care of your selfe, yet make some spare of mee. For perswade your selfe this, out of euery wound which your
<PB N="93" REF="51">
body shall receiue, will issue as well my bloud as yours.</P>
<P>And for constancie in your absence assure your selfe, <HI>Vir|ginia</HI> will alway b&eacute;e the vowed vassall of <HI>Icilius.</HI> And as the Laurell or Bay tree ceaseth not to b&eacute;e green, notwith|standyng the parchyng Sommer, and pinchyng Winter, so will I neuer cease to bee fresh in freendship, and green in godwill towardes you, nothwithstandyng the sharpe stormes of absence, the distance of place, and difference of time. But here teares stayed the talk of the one, and time tooke away any longer abode of the other, whervpon they were constrained after a few carefull kisses, to giue eche other a faintyng farewell. Neither is it easie to poynte foorth the payne wherwith this partinge pinched bothe these poore louers, but surely in my fancie of al greifes it is most gripyng when freindes are forced to parte eche from other, when one hart is placed in two places, when one member is torne as it were from another, when ownes selfe is separated from him selfe, or at least his se|conde selfe. But their partyng was not so paynfull, but that shortly after their meetyng was as mornefull. For not longe after the departure of <HI>Icilius:</HI> as <HI>Virginia</HI> wal|ked abroade somwhat to recreate and solace her sorrow|full selfe, it was her fortune vnfortunately to b&eacute;e seene by one <HI>Appius Claudius,</HI> one of the <HI>Decemuirs,</HI> who were the cheife rulers of the citie, who by the furies of Hell was so set on fire in libidinous lust towardes that virgin, that he sought all the meanes possible to winne her to his wicked will: but seeyng her to firmely fortified in vertue, to bee by consent vanquished by villany, h&eacute;e determined by force to force her to his filthinesse. And as nothinge is so impos|sible which frantike furie will not enterprise, nothyng so shamefull whiche vnbrideled desire will not vndertake, nothing so false which fleshly filthinesse will not forge, so to brynge his purpose to passe hee coyned this deuise, hee caused one <HI>Marcus Cloudius</HI> a client of his, to lay clayme to the mayde as his bonde slaue: Who partly for awe of
<PB N="94" REF="52">
the tyrant, partly b&eacute;eyng apt of himselfe to vndertake any euill, tooke the matter vpon him, and the next time hee tooke her out of her fathers house, hee layde handes vpon her, commaunding her to folow him home, to the end <HI>Ap|pius</HI> might haue had his pleasure of her. But by the pitiful exclamation of the mayde and her nurse, a greate multi|tude of people began to muster about them, who hearyng whose daughter shee was, and that shee was b&eacute;etrothed to <HI>Icilius,</HI> thought it vnseemly that in the absence of her fa|ther and freind (who were both in the warres) she should bee violently caried into bondage, the title b&eacute;eyng not dis|cussed by the lawes, and therevpon with held <HI>M. Cloudius</HI> from hauynge hir away. Who s&eacute;eynge his might ouer|matcht by the multitude, tolde them hee ment not to deale by force, but his minde was for the playne proufe of his tytle and interest in her, to haue her beefore the cheif ma|gistrate of the citie, and only iudge in ciuil controuersies, who was <HI>Appius Claudius</HI> the only author of this euill.</P>
<P>B&eacute;eyng come b&eacute;efore him, hee tolde a solemne tale for the confirmation of his right in the mayde, saying shee was the daughter of a bond woman of his, that in her infancy shee was stolen from her mother, conueyed to <HI>Virginius,</HI> and from that time brought vp at his house and taken for his naturall childe, and for proufe hereof h&eacute;e brought in two or three knightes of the post to depose. The freindes of the maide not able to refell this forged tale, desired of the <HI>Iudas</HI> iudge that the matter might b&eacute;e adiourned vn|till the comming of her father <HI>Virginius. Apius</HI> answered that hee thought it good the matter should hange in sus|pence vntill the returne of her supposed father, but it was no reason but that hee who pretended, yea and had proo|ued to haue sutch right to her, should haue her in his cus|tody, vntill the matter were more examined: and vpon his honour h&eacute;e promised shee should bee foorth comminge to appeare at the time of her fathers approche. The peo|ple hearinge this iniurious iudgment of <HI>Appius,</HI> rather
<PB N="95" REF="52">
murmured at it, then durst make resistance against it, by reason wherof <HI>Marcus Cloudius</HI> b&eacute;egan to draw the maid to bee defloured, as the tiger in <HI>Hyrcane</HI> wooddes haleth the lambe to b&eacute;e deuoured. But god y^e righter of al wrongs and protector of all pure virgins, preuented the perill which hong ouer her head, &amp; sent home from y^e warres to succour her, her vncle <HI>Numitorius,</HI> and her spouse <HI>Icilius:</HI> who hearinge the haynousnesse of the matter, presently presed to the place where <HI>Appius</HI> sate in iudgement, but hee commaunded his officers to k&eacute;epe <HI>Icilius</HI> backe, wher|vpon <HI>Icilius</HI> inueighed against him in this sort.</P>
<P>Albeit (O <HI>Appius</HI>) by force you keepe mee from keepe|inge mine owne out of your handes, yet shall you not stay my toung from detecting the villany which you indeuour to doe. For the truth is, this virgin is betrothed to m&eacute;e, and my minde is to marrie her a chast maide, therfore as|sure your selfe if it lie in mee to let, shee shal not remaine one minute of an houre out of her fathers house. Is it not sufficiente for you to depriue the people of the cheife pil|lors of their liberty, but that our wiues and children also must liue in slauery to your tirranny? Exercise your cru|elty on our bodies, at least let chastity bee in safety.</P>
<P>Ought princes to giue light of life to their people, and wil you make your selfe a mirrour of mischeife to your poste|rity? But if you minde to take her away from vs by force and from her, her virginity, neuer thinke to doe it while I haue any breath left in my body, for in this iust cause and quarrell of my wife, life shall sooner leaue mee then loyalty. <HI>Appius</HI> thinkinge the power of <HI>Icilius</HI> would preuaile aboue his, for that the multitude meruaylously inclined to his side, sayd h&eacute;e would haue another time to represse the rebellious rage of <HI>Icilius,</HI> and touchinge the maide for her fathers sake hee was content to defer the pronouncinge of sentence against her, vntill the nexte court day that her father might bee present, in the meane while h&eacute;e would intreate <HI>Marcus Cloudius</HI> to forbeare his
<PB N="96" REF="53">
right: but if her father came not by the next court day, hee would defer the execution of iustice for no mans ple|sure. Presently vpon this hee dispatched letters to the captaine generall of the army, that hee should not in any wise dismisse <HI>Virginius</HI> or suffer him to come home: but <HI>Icilius</HI> had sent for him with such sp&eacute;ede that he had leaue to depart beefore those letters came to the captayne, so it pleased god to preuent the pollicy and wicked purpose of <HI>Appius.</HI> Now <HI>Virginius</HI> b&eacute;einge come to <HI>Rome,</HI> went with his daughter to the iudgement place, and did there lamentably implore the helpe of the people, sayinge: while I with the rest of the souldiours haue hazarded our liues in the defence of you and your children, I am in daunger to haue mine owne daughter dispoyled: &amp; wher|as by my helpe our city is preserued from enemies, I my selfe am brought to sutch misery, as if it were taken by our enemies and vtterly razed to the ground. For what greater villany can b&eacute;e done to the vanquished, then to s&eacute;e b&eacute;efore their eyes their wiues and children desloured and defiled? But neighbours and freindes if you suffer m&eacute;e to sustaine this iniury, assure your selues your staffe stan|deth next to the dore, and looke no longer to b&eacute;e husbands ouer your wiues, and parentes ouer your children, then it shall please these tirantes to giue you leaue. Any euill at the first entring in of it may easely b&eacute;e auoyded, but let one or two presidentes passe patiently without resisting, and it will run into a custome, and from thence to a law, and you will neuer b&eacute;e able after to rid your handes of it. And if your owne safety driue you not to succour m&eacute;e, yet let my old yeeres, my hoary heires, the honest port which I haue euer maintained, and the chast life of my daugh|ter moue you to put to your handes to helpe redresse my wronge. By this time <HI>Appius</HI> was come to the iudge|ment place with a great troupe of armed men, and s&eacute;eing <HI>Virginius</HI> there contrary to his expectation, and percey|ning no colour of law could cloud his dooings, h&eacute;e set down
<PB N="97" REF="53">
his owne will for a law, and sayd h&eacute;e would defraud <HI>Mar|cus Cloudius</HI> no longer of his right, and s&eacute;einge the maide was conuicted by proufe and witnes to b&eacute;e his bond maid, he gaue sentence that he should presently haue her away, not suffering her father to alleage any thing for her fr&eacute;e|dome. <HI>Virginius</HI> seeing this extreeme dealing of <HI>Appius</HI> threatningly shooke his hands at him, saying, I haue b&eacute;e|trothed my daughter to <HI>Icilius</HI> not to thee (O <HI>Appius</HI>) &amp; I haue brought her vp to bee an honest maried woman, not thy harlot. What doest thou thinke vnder the pretence of bondage, to make her bound to thy beastlinesse? <HI>Appius</HI> not regarding his rayling caused his officers to make the multitude giue place to <HI>Marcus Cloudius</HI> that hee might quietly cary away his bond mayd, by reason wherof <HI>Vir|ginia</HI> was left voide of helpe and rescue, which her father perceiuing and s&eacute;eing him self not able to deliuer her out of her enemies handes, to defer the time hopinge still for helpe, h&eacute;e vsed this pollicy: h&eacute;e desired <HI>Appius</HI> hee might haue his daughter aside, and betw&eacute;ene her nurce and her examine the matter, that if it were found h&eacute;e were but her fained father, h&eacute;e might the more willingly depart with her. Which b&eacute;eing by <HI>Appius</HI> graunted, they thr&eacute;e went aside together, where <HI>Virginia</HI> fell downe vpon her knees and made this ruthles request vnto her father.</P>
<P>I perceiue (deare father) it is not without great cause that the philosophers were of this opinion, that the grea|test felicity is neuer to b&eacute;e borne, and the second soone to die, now s&eacute;eing by your meanes I am depriued of the first I beseech you by your meanes let mee inioy the second: and to counteruayle the lucklesse and lothsome life which you haue giuen m&eacute;e, vouchsafe to bestow on mee an ho|nourable death. And as by your fatherly care I haue con|tinued a continent virgin hetherto, so by your furthering aide I praye you let mee dye an honest mayde presently: least my life hereafter, contaminate y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> commendation of my life heretofore: and seeing I can bee no longer suffred
<PB N="98" REF="54">
to liue honestly, good father let mee die honourably? For an honourable death is alwayes to bee preferred beefore an infamous life, of euils the least is to bee chosen, and death of body is to bee counted a lesse euill, then distructio~ of body and soule. I thinke I may by more right craue your helpe herein, for that partly by your meanes I am fallen into this extremity, for y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> you would not agree to y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> consummation of the mariage betweene <HI>Icilius</HI> and mee, and howe you can deliuer mee, but by deliuering mee to death I see not, for that your power is to weake to wreak the wrong which is offred mee, and your force is to f&eacute;eble to fence mee from the fury of my foes. Therfore seeing hee will needes haue my body (sweet father) let him haue it dead, that I may not feele the filthinesse which hee pur|poseth to force mee too. Her father melting into teares at her pitifull sute, carefully kissing her, commended her couragious minde, rather confirming her in her constant couragiousnesse, then disswadinge her from her purpose. By this time the tirantes traine beegan to flocke aboute them to haue her away, which <HI>Virginius</HI> seeing snatched a butchers knife from the shambels and thrust therewith his daughter to the heart, saying: O daughter, by this only meane wherby I may doe I make thee free. <HI>Icilius</HI> see|inge his spouse thus spoyled, spent no time in triflinge teares, but by the helpe of his father in lawe <HI>Virginius,</HI> prosecuted the matter so ernestly against <HI>Appius</HI> that hee was throwen into prison, where for shame of his deede and dread of deserued punnishment, hee did him selfe des|perately to death.</P>
<P>You see here Gentlewomen, a most lamentable death of a most vertuous virgin, wherein you may note a no|ble minde in her to desyre it, a stout courage in her father to doe it, and most outragious tyranny in <HI>Appius</HI> to driue them to it: wherby you may learne that vertue and chas|tity is to bee preferred beefore worlde or wealth, beefore freind or father, before loue or liuing, before life or death.

Therfore, if I were either in wit able or otherwise wor|thy to giue you counsayle, I would aduise you to auoyde the traines of sutch tyrauntes, to k&eacute;epe you out of the sight of sutch seedsuckers, and to fly from sutch <HI>Senes fornecato|res:</HI> sutch raueninge wolues in sh&eacute;epes cloathinge are re|diest to deuoure sutch sw&eacute;ete sh&eacute;epe, sutch olde dogs euer bite forest, sutch grauity for the most parte contayneth most incontinency.

<P>And as I would you should auoide these olde youthes in the way of wickednesse, so if my wish might wield your willes, you should neither medle with them in the way of mariage.

The destines graunt him a double date of life if hee can finde one to die for him, which <HI>Alcest</HI> her self perfourmeth: for whose death <HI>Admetus</HI> most woful|ly lamentyng, shee was eftsoones by <HI>Proserpina</HI> restoa|red to her life, and louer agayne.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is a saying no lesse common then commonly proued true, that Marriages are guided by destinie, &amp; amongst all the contractes which concerne the life of man, I think they only bee not in our owne power or pleasure: which may plainly appeare by this, that when the choice of sutch marriages doth chaunce vnto vs as w&eacute;e our selues can wish, when they may by their parents &amp; freindes counte|nance
<PB N="101" REF="55">
vs, by their dowry and portion profit vs, by theyr person and bewtie pleasure vs, by their vertue and per|fection euery way place vs in paradise, yet it is often s&eacute;en that wee set litle by them, neither make any account of sutch profitable profers, but by a contrarie course of the heauens and destinies, are caried, as it were agaynst our willes, some other way, and caused to settle in affection there where heauen and earth s&eacute;eme to withstand our de|sire, where freindes frowne on vs, where wealth wants, where there is neither fecilitie in pursuyng, neither feli|citie in possessing: which the history which you shal heare shall more playnly set forth vnto you.</P>
<P>There raygned in the lande of <HI>Lybia</HI> one <HI>Atys,</HI> who had to his neighbour more neere then was necessary one <HI>Lycabas</HI> kynge of Assur, which princes rather couetynge their neighbours dominions, then co~tentyng themselues with their owne, incroched eche one vpon others right, and continued continuall warre one against the other. But at length <HI>Atys,</HI> whether hee were weried and wa|sted with warre, or whether hee had occasion to bend his force some other way, or whether h&eacute;e were disposed to en|ter into league and amitie with his neighbours I know not, but h&eacute;e sent his one sonne <HI>Admetus</HI> to <HI>Lycabas</HI> to parl&eacute;e of a peace. Now Lycabas either thinkyng h&eacute;e had him at some aduau~tage, either not minding to put vp iniu ries b&eacute;efore receiued, would accept no conditions of peace, but by <HI>Admetus</HI> sent his father flat defiance. So that the warre continued between them in as great rage as it had done the former time of their raygne. But yet hate cau|sed not sutch hoate skirmishes between the parentes, but that loue forced as fierce assaultes between the children. For it was so that <HI>Lycabas</HI> had a daughter named <HI>Alcest,</HI> who what time <HI>Admetus</HI> was in her fathers court to in|treate of peace, chaunced out at her chaumber window to haue a sight of him, and hee at the same time happened to incounter a vewe of her. And as small drops of rayne in|gender
<PB N="102" REF="56">
great flouddes, and as of litle seedes grow greate trees, so of this litle looke and sight grew sutch great loue and delight that death it selfe could not dissolue it. For as women bee of delicate and fine mettall, and therefore soone subiect to loue, so <HI>Alcest</HI> after this first sight was so ouergone in goodwill towardes <HI>Admetus,</HI> that shee fixed her only felicitie in framyng in her fancie the fourme of his face, and printyng in her heart the perfection of his person. And as nothyng breedeth bane to the body sooner then trouble of minde, so shee perseuered so longe in sutch pensiue passyons, and carefull cogitations, that her body was brought so lo for lacke of the vse of sleepe and meate, that shee was fayne to keepe her bed: and by reason that shee couertly concealed her greife, it burned so furiously within her, that it had almost cleane consumed her away. Her father seeinge her in this heauy case, assembled all the learned phisitions hee could learne of in the country, who hauinge seene her were all altogether ignorant of her disease, and were at their wits ende what medicine to apply to her malady. Some thought it a consumption, some a burning feuer, some a melancholy humor, some one thing, some another. And her father examyning her how it held her, and what disease shee thought it to bee, shee answered that it was a sicknesse which it pleased god to sende her, and that it was not in y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> helpe of Phisicke to heale her, but her health was onely to bee had at gods handes. Nowe <HI>Admetus on</HI> the other side hauinge the profer of many princes made him in the way of mariage, made very carelesse account thereof, and seemed in his minde to bee very angry with those offers: and as the sight of meat is very lothsome to him whose stomacke is ill or hath already eaten his fill, so that litle sight which hee had of <HI>Alcest</HI> had fed his fancy so full, that to see, or so mutch as think, of any other woman was most greeuous vnto him. And notwithstandinge the gripinge paine of loue caused some graftes of greife to begin to growe in
<PB N="103" REF="56">
his heart: yet by reason that h&eacute;e had the conducting of the army royall vnder his father, h&eacute;e was so busily occupied that he had no great leasure to lodge any louing thoughts within his breast. But s&eacute;e howe the destinies dealt to driue this bargaine thorow. There aroase a quarrell b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene the two armies touchinge certaine pointes wherin the law of armes was thought to b&eacute;e broken, to decide which controuersy <HI>Admetus</HI> was sent post to <HI>Ly|cabas:</HI> who sitting by his daughters bed side, had woorde brought him that <HI>Admetus</HI> was come to the court to im|part matters of importance vnto him. Nowe at this instant there chaunced one of the Phisitions to hold <HI>Al|cest</HI> by the arme and to f&eacute;ele her pulses, and where before they beate very f&eacute;ebly as if sh&eacute;e had b&eacute;ene ready to y&eacute;elde to the sommance of death, sh&eacute;e no sooner heard that mes|sage brought vp to her father, but that her pulses began to beat with great force and liuelinesse: which the phisition perceiuinge perswaded him selfe h&eacute;e had found the cause of her calamity: but for more assured proufe h&eacute;e whiste|red the king in the eare desiring him that <HI>Admetus</HI> might b&eacute;e sent for thither and there to make relation of his mes|sage vnto him: which the kinge caused to b&eacute;e done accor|dingly. <HI>Admetus</HI> was no sooner admitted into the cham|ber, but her pulses beegan to beate againe with wonder|full swiftnesse, and so continued all the while h&eacute;e was in the chaumber. Who s&eacute;einge his loue in sutch daunger of her life, though h&eacute;e vnderstood not the cause therof, yet h&eacute;e cast sutch a carefull countenance towardes her, that shee easely perceiued h&eacute;e did participate in payne with her: which made her cast sutch glaunces of goodwill to|wardes him, that h&eacute;e easely vnderstood it was for his sake sh&eacute;e sustained sutch sorow and sicknesse. But the feare of her father, who was his mortall foe, and the vrgent ne|cessity of his affaires, forced him to depart without ma|nifesting vnto her the manifolde good will h&eacute;e bare her. And though his departure were litle better then death to
<PB N="104" REF="57">
the damsell, yet for that sh&eacute;e knew her loue to b&eacute;e incoun|tred with like affectio~ (wherof before sh&eacute;e stoode in doubt) shee beegan to driue away the darke cloudes of dispaire and to suffer the bright light of hope to shine vpon her. <HI>Admetus</HI> b&eacute;eing gone, the Phisition tooke the king a syde and tolde him his daughters disease was not deriued of any distemperature of the body but only of the disquiet|nesse of the minde: and to tell you the truth plainely (saith hee) it is only the feruent affection sh&eacute;e beareth to that younge prince <HI>Admetus</HI> your enemy that forceth this f&eacute;e|blenesse and faintnes in her. And told the kinge by what meanes h&eacute;e tried the truth therof. The kinge at these wordes was meruailously disquieted perswading himself that it was so in d&eacute;ede, and that <HI>Admetus</HI> on the other side bare affection to his daughter, for that all the time of his talke with him, h&eacute;e continually turned his eyes to|wards her bed, and wold often times giue him answeres nothinge pertinent to the questions which h&eacute;e proposed vnto him, as hauing his cogitations conuersaunt in other matters. Upon this the king went to his daughter, &amp; as the phisition first ministreth to his patient bitter pilles and purgations to expell grose and ill humours, and then applieth lenitiues and restoratiues to br&eacute;ede and bringe againe good bloud, so h&eacute;e first vsed sharpe threatnings vn|to her to expell the force and fury of her loue, and then v|sed gentle perswasions to restore her to her former helth and quiet of minde. But neither the sowernesse of the one, neither the sw&eacute;etnesse of the other could preuayle, for salues seldome helpe an ouerlong suffred sore, it is to late to shut the stable dore when the st&eacute;ede is stolen, it booteth not to stop the breach when the towne is ouerflo|wen: it is to late to dislodge loue out of ones breast, when it hath infected b&eacute;efore euery parte of the body. For as sowninge mortifieth euery member, as pestilence infec|teth euery part, as poyson pierseth euery vaine, so loue if it b&eacute;e not in time looked too, will bringe both body and
<PB N="105" REF="57">
minde to vtter confusion. For this virgin was so van|quished by loue, that sh&eacute;e neither forced her fathers faire wordes, neither feared his fierce threatninges, but tolde him plainly sh&eacute;e would not deny the loue she bare <HI>Adme|tus,</HI> neither could cast out of her minde the liking sh&eacute;e had conceiued of him: and therfore humbly craued pardon if (sayth shee) it b&eacute;e an offence to loue him honestly, which deserueth it worthily. But her father in a fury flunge from her sayinge, sh&eacute;e should neuer inioy him with ioye, and that shee should neuer finde any more fatherly fur|therance at his handes, then the greatest enemy hee had. The younge princesse perceiuinge her fathers goodwill thus alienated from her, reposed her onely comforte and confidence in <HI>Admetus,</HI> hoping that h&eacute;e would stande her in st&eacute;ede of both a freind, phere, and father. And with as conuenient sp&eacute;ede as shee could, wrought a letter to him to this ende.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>If (most p&eacute;erelesse prince) necessity or loue had law, I might b&eacute;e thought perchaunce to transgresse the law and limyttes of modesty in first giuinge the onset where as I ought not easely to haue yelded b&eacute;eing assaulted. But s&eacute;e|inge necessity and lacke of oportunity, by reason of the rigour of the warres perchaunce causeth you to conceale that which you would discouer, and vehemente loue and feruent desire forceth m&eacute;e to discouer that which I should conceale, I thinke it lesse offence by this meanes to sup|plye your wante and satisfie mine owne desire, then, by standing vpon the nice termes of my maidens estate, to suffer both of vs to pine away in paine for lacke of b&eacute;eing priuy to eche others minde and purpose. Therfore you shall vnderstand the cause of my writing is this. What time your good hap (I hope) was to bee at my fathers court, I did perceiue (if desire to haue it so did not deceiue m&eacute;e) that your affection was great towardes mee, and that you seemed not a litle to bee pinched with my payne, to ease you of which greife I thought it my duty to certify

you, that the certaine hope which I therby conceiued of your loue and good will, did presently restoare m&eacute;e to per|fect health, and further to let you vnderstand, that the on|ly cause of my sicknesse was the first sight which I had of you, and the dispaire that I should neuer bee so fortunate as to obtaine you. Now as the same hand which did hurt mee, did helpe mee, so if I haue any way wounded you, I shalbee ready to make you what playster it please you to heale your hurt? And iudginge the sincerity of your minde by the cl&eacute;erenesse of mine owne conscience, I com|mit my selfe wholy into your handes, presuminge thus far of your perfect loue towardes mee, that you will not any way seeke the disperagement of mine honour (which I hold far more deere then loue or life) but accept mee for your lawfull and louing spouse. And that way you only and at any time shall dispose of mee at your pleasure. My father by ill fortune hath found out our loue, and stormeth greatly therat, so that I thinke his haggard hart is by no meanes to bee reclaimed. But I thinke indirect dea|linge by the daughter may bee vsed, when the father by rage rather then reason is ruled. Therfore if you thinke so good, I will secretly conueigh my selfe to what place you will haue mee, but I commit this matter to your wis|dome, and my selfe to you, remayninge yours onely and euer: <HI>ALCEST.</HI></P>

And as the spider feeleth if her web bee prickt but with the point of a pin, so if our childred bee touched but with the least trouble that is, wee feele the force of it to perce vs to the hart. But how well this tender care is by them considered, alas it maketh my hart bleed to think if wee looke for obedience of them, and that they shoulde follow our counsayle in the conuaighe of their affaires, why they thinke wee doate, and that their owne wits are far better then ours: if w&eacute;e warne them to bee wary and thrifty, they thinke it proceedeth rather of couetous|nesse

then of kindenes: if wee prouide them no mariages, it is bicause wee will departe with no liuinge to them: if w&eacute;e perswade them to mariage, it is bicause w&eacute;e would haue them forsake all good felowship, &amp; liue like clownes in the countrey by the Plowe tayle: If w&eacute;e perswade them to learnynge it is that they might liue by it with|out our charge: if w&eacute;e perswade them to one wife ra|ther then another, it is bicause the one is ritcher then the other: if w&eacute;e looke seuerely on them, w&eacute;e loue them not: if w&eacute;e vse them familiarly, w&eacute;e feede them with flattery bicause w&eacute;e will giue them litle: and so of all our louing dooinges they make these leud deuises: yea when w&eacute;e haue brought them vp with greate care and coste, when w&eacute;e haue trauailed all our time by sea and by land, early and late, in paine and in peril, to heape vp treasure for them, when w&eacute;e haue by continuall toyle shortned our owne liues to lengthen and inlarge their liuinges and possessions, yet if w&eacute;e suffer them not to royst and to riot, to spill and to spoyle, to swashe and to lashe, to lend and to spende, yea and to followe the fury of their owne frantike fancies in all things, this forsooth is our recom|pence, they wish an end of our liues to haue our liuings. Alas a lamentable case, why hath not nature caused loue to ascend as well as discend? Why hath shee indued the Storke with this property to f&eacute;ede his damme, when sh&eacute;e is olde, and men with sutch malice to wish their parents death when they are aged? But I speake perchaunce of mine owne proper greife, god forbid it should b&eacute;e a com|mon case, for my sonne (Ah why doo I call him sonne) hath not only wisht my death but wrought it. H&eacute;e knew h&eacute;e was my onely delight, h&eacute;e knew I coulde not liue h&eacute;e b&eacute;eing out of my sight: h&eacute;e knew his desperate disobedi|ence would driue mee to a desperate death. And could h&eacute;e so mutch doate of a light damsell, to force so litle of his louing father? Alas a wife is to b&eacute;e preferred before fa|ther and freind. But had hee none to sixe his fancy on
<PB N="113" REF="61">
but the daughter of my most furious foe? Alas loue hath no respecte of persons. Yet was not my goodwill and consent to bee craued therin? Alas hee saw no possibility to obtaine it. But now alas I would graunt my goodwil, but now alas it is to late: his feare of my fury is to great euer to bee found, his fault is to great euer to looke mee in the face more, and my sorrowe is to great euer to bee saluted. And therevpon got him to bed and in fiue dayes space his naturall moysture with secret sorrowe was so soken away, that hee could no longer continue his careful life, but yeelded willingly to desired death. So it pleased God to prouide for the poore pilgrimes, who hauing past many a fearful forrest and daungerous desert, were now come to the sea shoare mindinge to take ship and trauell into vnknowen coastes, where they might not by any meanes bee knowne, and b&eacute;eing on ship borde they heard the mayster of the ship make report that <HI>Atys</HI> king of the <HI>Lybians</HI> was dead. Wherevpon <HI>Admetus</HI> desired to b&eacute;e set on shoare againe, and dissemblinge the cause thereof, pretended some other matter and got to the next towne wherwith the mony and iewels h&eacute;e had about him, hee furnished him selfe and his lady with the best apparell could bee prouided in the towne, and with sutch a trayne of men as hee coulde there take vp: whiche done hee made the greatest expedition hee coulde vnto his owne country where hee was royally receiued as prince, and shortly after ioyfully crowned Kinge. And beeing qui|etly, setled in the regall seate, hee presently dispatched Ambassadours to <HI>Lycabas</HI> his fathers foe, and his father in law, whose ambassade contained these two pointes, the one to intreat a peace for his people, the other to craue a pardon for his wife, who willingly graunted both the one and the other. Wherby hee now liued in great quiet and tranquillity. A meruaylous mutabylity of fortune which in the space of a moneth could bring him from hap|py ioy to heauy annoy, and then from annoy againe to
<PB N="114" REF="62">
greater ioy then his former ioy. For as the sunne hauing bene long time ouerwhelmed with darke cloudes, when it hath bannished them from aboute it, seemes to shyne more brightly then at any time beefore, so the state and condition of this prince hauinge bene couered with the cloudes of care, now it was cleared of them, seemed more pleasaunt and happy then at any time before. And ve|rely as sharpe sauce giues a good taste to sweete meate, so trouble and aduersity, makes quiet and prosperity for more pleasaunt. For hee knoweth not the pleasure of plenty, who hath not felt the paine of penury, hee takes no delight in meate, who is neuer hongry: hee careth not for ease who was neuer troubled with any disease.</P>
<P>But notwithstandinge the happy life of this prince, albe|it hee abounded in as great ritches as hee required, albe|it hee had as many kingedomes as hee coueted, albeit h&eacute;e had sutch a wife as hee wished for, yea and inioyed all things which either god could giue him, fortune further him to, or nature bestow vpon him: yet to shew that there is no sunne shineth so bright but that cloudes may ouer cast it, no ground so good but that it bringeth forth weeds as well as flowers, no kinge so surely garded, but that the gamesome goddes fortune will at least checke him, if not mate him, no state so plentifull in pleasure, but that it is mixed with paine, hee had some weedes of wo which began to grow vp amongst his flowers of felicity, &amp; some chippes of sory chaunce did light in the heape of his hap|pynesse. Yea fortune presented her selfe once agayne vpon the stage and ment to haue one flinge more at him. For this prince possessinge sutch a pleasaunte life, tooke great delight in good house keepinge, and gaue sutch good entertainment to straungers that his fame was far spred into forrain countries: yea the rumor thereof reached to the skies, in so mutch that <HI>Apollo</HI> (as the poets report) hauing occasion to discend from heauen to the earth, went to see the entertainement of <HI>Admetus:</HI> who was so roy|ally
<PB N="115" REF="62">
receiued by him, that the god thought good with some great kindnesse to requite his great curtesie. And as <HI>Phi|lemon</HI> and <HI>Laucis,</HI> for their harty house keepinge, were preserued by the goddes from drowning when al the cun|try and people besides were ouerflowen, so the god <HI>A|pollo</HI> ment to preserue his life, when all his countrey and people then lyuing should lie full loe in their graues. And of the destinies of death obtained thus much for him, that if when the time and terme of his naturall life drewe to an end, yf any coulde b&eacute;e found who would willingly die &amp; loose their owne life for him, hee should begin the course of his life againe, and continue on earth another age.</P>
<P>Now when the time of his naturall life drew to an ende, there was diligent inquiry made who would b&eacute;e content to abridge their owne dayes, to prolong their princes life. And first the question was put to his freindes (who were n&eacute;erest to them selues) then to his kinsfolke (whose loue was asmutch of custome as of kindenesse) then to his sub|iectes (whose affection was as mutch for feare as for fa|uour) then to his seruauntes (who thought their life as sw&eacute;ete as their mayster did his) then to his children (who thought it reason that as their father did first enter into this life so hee should first depart out of this life) so that there coulde none b&eacute;e founde so franke of their life to set this prince fr&eacute;e from the force of death. Now <HI>Alcest</HI> see|ing the death of her deare husband draw n&eacute;ere, and know|inge her owne life without his life and loue would b&eacute;e but lothsome vnto her, of her owne accorde offred her selfe to b&eacute;e sacrificed for her husbandes sake, and to hasten her owne death to prolonge his life. O loyall louing wife, O wight good inough for god him selfe. And yet had sh&eacute;e a husband good inough for her selfe, for hee loued her so intirely that though by loosing her h&eacute;e might haue gained life long time, yet would hee not by any meanes consent to her death, sayinge, without her life his life would b&eacute;e more gr&eacute;euous vnto him then a thousand deathes. But
<PB N="116" REF="63">
sh&eacute;e perswaded with him against herself all that sh&eacute;e could saying, I would not (O peerles prince) you should take the matter so kindly at my hands, as though for your sake only I offred vp my life, for it is in d&eacute;ede the commodity of your country and mine owne, b&eacute;einge vnder your domy|nion, which driueth mee hereto, knowinge my selfe vn|able to gouerne them you beeing gone. And considering the dayly warre, the spoylefull wastes, the bloudy blastes, the troublesome strife which your realme is subiect too, I thought you had not loued mee so litle as to leaue mee be|hinde you to beare on my weake backe sutch a heauy bur|then, as I thinke <HI>Atlas</HI> him selfe could scarce sustaine.</P>
<P>Againe, considering that death is but a fleeting from one life into another, and that from a most miserable lif&euml; to a most happy life, yea from bale to blisse, from care to quiet, from Purgatory to Paradise, I thought you had not en|uied mee so mutch, as to thinke mee vnwoorthy of it. Doo you not know that <HI>Cleouis</HI> and <HI>Byton</HI> had death bestowed on them as the best gifte which God could deuise to giue them, and doe you thinke it can doe mee harme, especial|ly seeing I may therby doe you good? Alas sweet wife (sayth <HI>Admetus</HI>) this your piety is vnprofitable which is subiect to so many perils. But if death bee so good (good wife) let m&eacute;e inioy it, who am inioyned to it, and to whom onely it will be good, for death is onely good to m&eacute;e whom it is giuen, not to you who are not appointed to it. For it is not lawfull for any to leaue this life without speciall permission of the goddes. And as in our court it is lawful for none to haue accesse vnto vs vnlesse by vs hee bee sent for, so neither is it lawfull for any to appeare before the heauenly throne, vnlesse by the goddes hee be sommoned. Neither wil death bee so easy to you as to mee, whose na|ture is apt to yeelde vnto it. For you see fruite whiche is not ripe, will scarce with strength bee torne from the tree, wheras that which is ripe falleth easely of it owne accord. Therefore (good wife) giue mee leaue to die to
<PB N="117" REF="63">
whom it wilbee onely good and easy to die. Why sweet husband (sayth shee) the god <HI>Appollo</HI> allowed any that would to die for you, otherwise to what purpose was that which hee obtayned of the destinies for you? And for the vneasines of death, nothing can bee vneasy or hard vnto a willing heart. But bicause your pleasure is so, I am content to continue my carefull life, and with sorrowe to suruiue you. And so left her husbande and went priuily to the Aulter and offred vp her selfe to death to prolonge her husbands life. Which when the king knew, hee would presently haue spoyled him selfe, but his handes had not the power to doe it, for that by the decr&eacute;e of the destinies hee must now of force liue another age on earth. Which when h&eacute;e saw, h&eacute;e filled the court with sutch pitifull way|ling, sutch bitter weeping, sutch hellishe houlinge, that it pearced the heauens and mooued the gods to take remorse on his misery. And <HI>Proserpine</HI> y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> goddes of hell especiallye pitying y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> parting of this louing couple (for y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> she her selfe knew the paine of partinge from freinds, beeing by <HI>Dys</HI> stolen fro~ her mother <HI>Ceres</HI>) put life into his wife againe, and w^t speed sent her vnto him.

<P>This s&eacute;emeth straunge vnto you (Gentlewoman) that a woman should die and then liue againe, but the mea|ninge of it is this, that you should die to your selues and liue to your husbandes, that you should counte their life your life, their death your distruction: that you should not care to disease your selues to please them: that you should in all thinges frame your selues to their fancies: that if you see them disposed to mirth, you should indeuour to bee pleasaunt: if they bee solemne, you should b&eacute;e sad: if they hard, you hauinge: if they delight in haukes, that you

<P>SCILLA, daughter to <HI>Nisus</HI> kynge of <HI>Alcatho&eacute;,</HI> disdayne|fully reiecting the humble sute of <HI>Iphis,</HI> a yonge Gentle|man of her fathers Courte, becommeth vnaduisedly a|morous of kynge <HI>Minos,</HI> her fathers and countries mor|tall foe, lyinge in siege aboute the Citie.

And beeyng imbarked to depart homewards, shee assayeth to swim after him, and is drowned in the Sea.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MAny are of opinion that the vertues of loue are very many, &amp; that it is of force to reduce vs from sauage|nesse to ciuilnesse, from folly to wit, from couetousnesse to liberalitie, from clownishnesse to courtlinesse, yea from al vice to all vertue. But if the effectes therof b&eacute;e rightly co~|sidered, I s&eacute;e not but that w&eacute;e may more iustly say, that the inconueniences of loue b&eacute;e infinite, and that it brin|geth vs from modesty to impudencie, from learnynge to lewdnesse, from stayed firmnes to staggering fickelnesse, from liberalitie to prodigalitie, from warinesse to wilful|nesse, from good b&eacute;ehauiour to dissolute liuinge, from rea|son to rage, yea from all goodnesse to all vanitie. As may b&eacute;e iustified by the goddes themselues, by the godliest men that euer were, by the wisest men that euer were, and by the valiantest men that euer were. Who by loue haue b&eacute;en brought to most outragious impietie, to moste ex|tr&eacute;eme foly, and most vile villany. But Gentlewomen, bicause most of you bee maydes (I meane at least taken so) I will manifest vnto you the mischeif of loue by the example of a mayde, in that estate (though I hope not e|uery way) like vnto your selues, that admonished there|by,
<PB N="120" REF="65">
you may auoyde the like inco~uenience in your selues.</P>
<P>Therfore you shall vnderstande that ouer the towne <HI>Alcatho&eacute;</HI> raigned one <HI>Nysus,</HI> who had to daughter a dam|sell named <HI>Scilla,</HI> a proper sw&eacute;et wenche, in goodlinesse a goddesse, in shape <HI>Venus</HI> her selfe, in shew a saynt, in per|fection of person p&eacute;erelesse: but in d&eacute;edes a dayntie daine, in manners a mercilesse mayde, and in workes a wilfull wenche, as by her life you shall perceyue. For there was attendant vpon her father in his court a proper youth na|med <HI>Iphis,</HI> who, as the freshest colours soonest fade the hue, and as the finest mettals soonest breake, so the more noble bloud hee came of, and the finer wit hee was in|dued withall, the sooner was hee made thrall and subiecte to loue: And the more couragious minde hee had, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> more haughtie conquest did hee indeuour to atchiue. For bee|yng in the dayly sight of <HI>Scilla,</HI> hee b&eacute;egan firmely to fixe his fonde fancie vpon her fine face. And by reason of his younge y&eacute;eres b&eacute;eyng ignorant that vnder moste gr&eacute;ene grasse lie most great snakes, and vnder intisinge baytes intanglyng hookes, h&eacute;e bit so gr&eacute;edely at the bayte of her beutie, that hee swallowed downe the hooke of hatefull hurt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, and hurtful heauinesse to his heart. But like a man hee sought meanes to subdue his sorrow and to vanquish this virgin, and first like a bashfull younge man hee soli|cited his sute by pitiful lookes, thinkyng therby to let her vnderstande his desire. But shee on the other side percei|uyng his intent, cast coy countenances vpon him to driue him to dispayre: so that where b&eacute;efore his owne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ful|nesse kept him from discouerynge his purpose, now her coynesse caused him to couer it. Yet extreme loue draue him to this extr&eacute;eme shift, hee imparted his purpose to an vncle of his, a noble man of great countenance in y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> court, humbly desiryng him either by counsayle, countenance, payne or policie to stande him in some stead to the attay|nyng of his purpose: his vnckel grauely aduised him to a|uoyde sutch vanitie and not to attempt any sutch enter|prise
<PB N="121" REF="65">
whereby he should incur the Kings displeasure, and <HI>per co~sequens</HI> his owne vndoyng. But he tolde this tale to one that had no eares to heare, for the deepenesse of his loue caused deafnesse in him to heare any thinge whiche might help to heale his harebraind head, for forwarde he would with his folly whatsoeuer came of it. The olde Gentleman seeing his vnaduisednes, tolde hym he would so far as he durst f&eacute;ele the fancye of the younge Princesse, and therby he should perceiue how likely he were to pre|vaile in his purpose. And hauinge conuenient time he fel to sifting her thoughts in this sort.</P>
<P>Fayre Lady, we haue letters come to the Court con|tayning this newes, that two or thr&eacute;e younge Princes haue directed their course into this Country to see and assay you in the way of marriage: wherein I doubt not but you will deale to the Kinges maiesties contentation, and to our Countryes commodytie: and to consider that the stay of the whole kingdome standeth vpon your mar|riage, for y^e he whiche marrieth you must after the kings decease succ&eacute;ede as lawfull heire vnto the crowne. Now if you match your selfe with a stranger, it is greatly to be feared that we shall be greatly molested with the fury of forraine force, for that the Kings garde and court for the most part shalbe of his owne Country: and so strangers shal be preferred to offices, and we set besides our liuing, wheras if it shall please you to take to husbande some of your owne country you shalbe as it were King &amp; Qu&eacute;ene your selfe, and he as it were your seruante and subiect. And so shal you raigne in great soueraignitie and we liue in great tranquillytie. His talke beeing ended the Prin|cesse made hym this prowde answer.</P>
<P>My Lord, touching my marriage it toucheth me more n&eacute;erely then you, and my father the Kinges counsell I meane ch&eacute;efely to follow therin: neither will I so respect your co~moditie to neglect mine owne honour, neither wil I haue more consideration of the stay of my Countrie,

And for marryinge any of mine country, I pro|mise you for my part I know neuer a Prince in all this country my father excepted. Meaninge she would matche with none vnder the degr&eacute;e of a Prince. Immediately after this the noble man called his nephew vnto him tel|ling him he thought it as easy a matter to climbe to hea|uen with ladders, as for so meane a man as he to aspyre to the height of her haughtie minde. The younge Gentleman thinking that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">kle for feare of displea|sure durst not deale in so daungerous a matter, neither gaue great credit to his wordes, neither y&eacute;elded him any thankes for his paines, but determined notwithstan|ding of hymselfe to pursue his sute. And knowing that proper Gentlewomen delight in prety Iewels, and that the Goddes them selues are pleased with gifts, he gat the most precious Pearles &amp; dearest Diamonds in the coun|try, and caused them to be presented vnto the Princesse from hym. But disdainfull rigour so ruled her, that she would not so mutch as looke vpon them, saying she had no n&eacute;ede of his giftes, that he might better bestowe them on those who were not his betters, and that she thought it shame a Princes person should be purchased with perles. The Gentleman though greatly dismaide to s&eacute;e both his goodwill neclected, and his giftes reiected, yet lyke a vali|aunt Souldiour he gaue a freshe onset vppon her with friendlye louing Letters whiche hee wrote in this wise.</P>

<P>Ah fond foolish girle, and canst thou finde in thine hart to beare freindly affection to thy fathers feendly foe? Can I loue him kindly, who seekes to spoyle my country cru|elly.

O loue without law, O rage without reason, O will without wit, O fan|sy fraught full of fury and frensy. Good God where are now beecome those lofty lookes I was wonte to vse to lo|uers?

Alas now I am made to stoupe without stale, to come without call or lure, yea to the empty fist. But alas who is priuiledged from the
<PB N="125" REF="67">
force of loue, no there are none so stout but loue maketh them stoupe, none so wise but loue maketh them fooles, none so shamefast but loue maketh them bolde. And though I should first bewray my affection and make loue to kinge <HI>Minos,</HI> the offence is rather to bee pitied then punished. Yea the more frankly I offer him my goodwil, the more freindly no doubt but hee will accept it: and the lesse h&eacute;e hath deserued it, the more will h&eacute;e indeuour him|self to bee thankful for the same. Neither can hee but take it as an vndoubted signe of deepe goodwill if I giue the first onset in this skirmishe: neither can it any way re|dound to my shame, the end b&eacute;einge honest and my mea|ninge in the way of mariage. And if it bee lawfull to fol|low the example of creatures without reason, doth not the Cow loe to the Bull, doth not the Mare neigh to the Horse, doth not the Yeaw blea to the Ramme, doth not the Faulcon call to the tossell gentle, the gerfaulcon to the Gerkin, the sparehauke to the Musket? And so of all other creatures the females are more forward that way then the males. Besides that by how mutch weaker wo|men are then men, by so mutch the more they are to bee borne with all, if they bee lesse able to beare the heauy burthen of loue then men. Againe by how mutch more the loue of women is more feruent then of men, the more fiery flames of force must fry within vs, whiche without great griefe cannot be concealed or couered. And where|of springeth this errour that women may not first make loue but only of a precise and curious custome, nay ra|ther a preiudicall and carefull custome I may tearme it to vs women: for wherof commeth it that so many of vs are so euill matcht in mariage, but only hereof, that w&eacute;e are tyed to the hard chose of those that offer their loue vn|to vs: where as if it were lawfull for vs to make loue where we lyked best, we woulde neuer marry but to our minde and contentation. Lastly I am not the first that haue played the lyke parte, and that whiche is done by
<PB N="126" REF="68">
alowable example is lawfully done. For <HI>Venus</HI> her selfe y&eacute;elded her selfe to her darlinge <HI>Adonis</HI> withoute any sute made on his part: <HI>Phaedra</HI> made sute to <HI>Hippo|litus: Oenone</HI> pleaded her right with <HI>Paris: Dido</HI> dyd <HI>Ae|neas</HI> to vnderstande how d&eacute;epely she desired him: <HI>Bryses</HI> besought the goodwill of <HI>Achilles: Adalesia</HI> by her gouer|nesse made loue to <HI>Alerane:</HI> the Dutchesse of <HI>Sauoy</HI> went on pilgrimage to y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Knight <HI>Mendoza:</HI> infinit lyke exampls I could alleage, and why is it not lawfull for me to do the lyke, and make loue to King <HI>Minos,</HI> who perchance would first haue sued to m&eacute;e, if he had first s&eacute;ene m&eacute;e? yes let the world iudge what they will, I wyll doe what I shal iudge best for my selfe, and with as conuenient sp&eacute;ede as I may I will either by letters or d&eacute;edes do <HI>Minos</HI> to vnderstand what minde I beare him. And as she was busely beating her braines here about, one of her most trusty and louing women came&punc; vnto her, humbly requestinge her to make her priuy to the cause of her perplexitie. Alas good miste|ris (saith she) yf you want any thing, let your friends vn|derstand it, and it shal be prouided. If my poore seruice may any way serue your turne, assure your selfe neither respect of honour, lyuing or lyfe, shall let mee from doing any thing, which may deliuer you out of distresse: if you haue imprisoned your libertie any where, and giued your selfe in the fetters of fansy, I know a Gentlewoman, my familier freind, who can stand you in as much steed for y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> obtaininge of your purpose as any gentlewoman in this Courte.</P>
<P>The princes desirous of aid in her distres, prayed her woman to procure the comminge of that Gentlewoman with all possible sp&eacute;ede. Whervpon the wayting woman caused one of the princesses gentlemen to goe to this ho|nest woman, and in her name to desire her to come to the princesse. You shall vnderstande this gentlewomans name, who was sent for, was <HI>Pandarina,</HI> in her youth a seruinge woman, and one which knewe more fashions
<PB N="127" REF="68">
then was fit for honest women. But nowe married to an honest Gentleman, sh&eacute;e entred into a newe religion seeming to renounce her olde fayth, &amp; setling her selfe in sutch hipocrysy, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> she rather counterfaited cunningly the~ liued co~tine~tly. But to paint her out more plainly she was more coy the~ cumly, more fine the~ wel fauored, more loftly the~ louely, more proud then proper, more precise the~ pure, more superstitious then religious, more of spighte then of the spirit, and yet nothing but honesty would downe w^t her, more Ielous then zelous, either iudging her husband by her selfe, or iudginge her selfe vnworthy the seuerall vse of so co~modious a commen as her husband was. Well sutch as shee was this younge gentleman of the younge princesse was sent for her, &amp; at y^e first comming according to the fashion hee kist her, and hauing done his message, with frowning face shee told him shee could not goe to the princesse, and though shee could yet would shee not goe with him. The Gentleman somwhat abashed hereat, returned to the gentlewoman that sent him, and told her what answere this honest woman made. Who mer|uailing mutch therat went presently her selfe vnto her, desiring that gentleman to accompany her. B&eacute;einge come to her lodging, after a few salutacions, <HI>Pandarina</HI> prayed the gentlewoman either to send vnto her a more modest messenger then the gentleman shee sent, or els to teache him to kisse more continently. The gentlewoman blush|inge for bashfulnes, told her she had not the skill to teache men to kisse, shee thought that cunning concerned co~mon harlots, or at least married women rather then her, but, sayth shee, I will tell him of it, that of him selfe hee may amend his fault, and callinge the gentleman aside vnto her, sh&eacute;e asked him how h&eacute;e had misused him selfe towards Misteris <HI>Pandarina</HI> in kissinge her. No way (sayth hee) that I knowe for, but if I kissed her boldly, I trust shee wil attribute it to young mens bashfulnesse, and if I kis|sed her kindly, I trust she wyll impute it to good will. Yes
<PB N="128" REF="69">
mary (sayth the gentlewoman) it was more hindely then shee cared for or liked of. Uerily (sayth hee) if it were ouer kinde, it is more then I know, or more then I ment for to speake my fancy freely, I know neuer a gentlewo|man in this lande, that I like of worse: and if shee bee a|ferde I bee to far in loue with her, I will bee bound in what bond shee will, to hate her no man more. But gen|tlewoman, if you adhibite any credite to my counsayle, flie her familiarity, eschew her company, sutch sayntes in shewe are Satans in d&eacute;ede, sutch fayned holinesse is double diue lishnesse, sutch counterfayte continencye I count litle better then baudry. For sure this is a most sure marke to knowe dissemblers by, that they will al|wayes far exc&eacute;ede the meane, for feare of b&eacute;eing found in their fayning. As those that fayne to weepe, houle out right: those that fayne to bee freindly, shew them selues plaine <HI>Parasites:</HI> as those that fayne to bee valiant, brag most gloriously: and as shee counterfaytinge continency, sheweth her selfe altogether curious and hipocritiall.</P>
<P>But notwithstandinge I haue had no knowledge of her life and conuersation, yet dare I lay my life on it, that either shee hath bene naught, is naught, or wilbe naught whensoeuer shee can get any foule adultrour fit for so fil|thy an adultresse. The Gentlewoman hearing him so er|nest, prayed him to put vp the matter patiently, sayinge shee thought it was but a shift to excuse her not comminge to the princesse: and so went to <HI>Pandarina</HI> telling her the Gentleman was sory h&eacute;e had offended her, and so away they went together to the princesse. I haue wandred, Gentlewomen, somwhat b&eacute;esides the path of my promi|sed purpose, but yet not cleane out of the way of mine owne will and intent. For though this digressio~ pertaine litle to the history I haue in hande, yet it may serue to ad|monish you that you take not executions of curiosyty a|gainst kisses which are giuen you of curtesy: and if there chaunce to b&eacute;e any fault in them, either modesty to con|ceale
<PB N="129" REF="69">
it, or presently to returne the kisses againe to him, which gaue them. But in excusing my former digression, I shall enter into another digression, therefore to the matter and purpose proposed. <HI>Pandarina</HI> beeinge pre|ferred to the presence of the Princesse, hauinge done dutifull reuerence humblye craued to knowe her plea|sure. Nay rather answered the princesse, it is my payne Gentlewoman which I meane to make you priuy to: and blushing either for giltinesse or for bashfulnesse, sh&eacute;e vn|folded y^t secrets of her thoughts to <HI>Pandarina</HI> in this sorte.</P>
<P>Gentlewoman, but that I know to whom I speake, I shoulde perchaunce b&eacute;e in doubt what to speake in this matter, which is somewhat vnmeete for my maydenly estate. But considering you are a woma~, and one who no doubt in your time haue felt the force of loue, I perswade my selfe I may boldly impart vnto you the panges of my passion, as to one who (I hope) will rather seeke a salue for my sore, then thinke sinisterly of my dooinges. Ther|fore you shall vnderstand that the sight of Kinge <HI>Minos,</HI> who layeth siege to our city, hath made sutch a breach in|to my heart, that I lie altogether open to his assaultes, and am fayne to yeeld my selfe his prisoner and captiue. And though it may seeme straunge vnto you that his for|ces b&eacute;einge not bent against m&eacute;e, should haue sutch force ouer m&eacute;e, yet it is often s&eacute;ene that a dart leueled at one, lightes on another. And though you may meruayle to s&eacute;e m&eacute;e y&eacute;elde beefore any onset bee giuen, yet no doubt that cittie merittes more mercy which y&eacute;eldeth without assault, then that which standeth to the doubtfull euent of battayle, and after mutch effusion of bloud, yeldeth when it is able to stand no longer in defence. For here the losse in the siege, taketh away the gaine in the conquest, the paine in pursuing, taketh away the plesure in possessing, and the hardnesse in winning drowneth the happinesse in wearing. And surely if maides would follow my coun|sayle, I would not wish them to set sutch solemne lookes,
<PB N="130" REF="70">
to vse sutch nice denials and dainty delayes to those, whom they thinke worthy of them, and whom they mean only shall inioy them. For they gaine nothing hereby but deferre their owne releife, and increase their louers greife. B&eacute;esides that when they are so hardly wonne, it is a signe they y&eacute;eld rather by importunity of the wooer, the~ by any inclination of goodwill on their owne part. But what neede I vse this defence, where no body chargeth m&eacute;e with any offence? This rather lieth m&eacute;e vpon, ernest|ly to craue your aide &amp; assistance in this my distresse, and that you will either by counsayle cure my disease, either by paine or pollicy put mee in possession of my desire.</P>
<P>I am thus bolde to commit this matter vnto you, presu|ming of your good wit, and goodwill towardes m&eacute;e. And if you shew sutch faythfull freindlynesse herein, as I ve|rily looke for, assure your selfe I will in sutch freindly manner requite it as you shall very well like of. Miste|ris <HI>Pandarina</HI> hauing attentiuely attended her talke, du|tifully replied in this sorte.</P>
<P>Most excellent Princesse, I am humbly to thanke you that it pleaseth you to repose sutch credite in m&eacute;e as to dis|cloase your secretes to m&eacute;e, and I shall thinke my selfe most happy, if my duty may any way doe you good, or my seruice satisfie your expectation. And touching your loue it is sutch that you n&eacute;ede not b&eacute;e ashamed to shew it, yea in my iudgemente it is rather to b&eacute;e commended euery way, the~ co~demned any way. For first in that your fancy is fixed on a prince, you shew your princely minde in ly|king your like: then in that you seke to ioyne your selfe to him in mariage, you shew your godly disposition, in de|siring to quenche the desires of your harte by that godly meane which god hath made and appointed. Thirdly in louinge your fathers soe, you followe gods commaunde|ment, who willeth you to requite good for euill. Yea and by this meanes you may b&eacute;e a meane to make peace and amity betweene two enemies, and saue your cittie front
<PB N="131" REF="70">
siege and sacke. Lastly in that you yeeld so quickly to the alarms of loue, you shew your fine nature and wit which are soonest subiect to the impression of loue. And for your opinion touching the dealing of dainty damsels, you are no doubt (Madame) in the right. For those which are so coyishe &amp; wilde, or so haggarde like, that searce in seuen yeeres sute they will b&eacute;e reclaimed, they plainely shewe themselues either to b&eacute;e of base mettal, as not to b&eacute;e capa|ble of loue, either of grose wittes as not to vnderstande when loue is made vnto them, either of slender iudgment as not to accept good offers, either of incontinent conuer|sation as beeing loth to bee tied to one diet, either of in|constaunt conditions, as iudging men as light of loue as themselues are lend of life, or els some way imperfecte that they are not meet for the holy state of matrimony.</P>
<P>Now wheras you craue my counsel and helpe to the brin|ging of your good purpose to passe, good Madame would I were as well able as willinge to doe you good: but so far as my simple wits can see in the matter, I thinke this way the best to worke your will: you knowe your father hath on his head a golden haire whereon dependeth the stay of his state and puissance of his power, no more but when your father is a sleepe, pull of the the heire and pre|sent kinge <HI>Minos</HI> therwith and no doubt but hee will im|brace you as the autor of his victory, and receiue you for his lawful and louing wife, so shal you redresse your own distres, and preserue the life of your father and his peo|ple, who perchaunce by the continuance of this warre, may come to confusion. The princesse likinge reasona|bly well of this practise of <HI>Pandarina,</HI> gaue her thankes for her good counsayle, and departed into her chamber by her selfe to thinke more of the matter, where shee entred with her selfe into these contrarieties.</P>
<P>I s&eacute;e there is no disease so desperate, but if it be taken in time phisick may help it: no matter so harde but poly|cie can preuaile in it, nor no policye so good but expery|ence
<PB N="132" REF="71">
will put into our heads: as may be s&eacute;ene by the sound aduice and perfect polycie of <HI>Pandarina.</HI> I warrant I am not the first clyent that this counsellour hath had, I am not the first <HI>Pupill</HI> that she hath practised for, this is not the first sluttish sute that she hath bene Solicyter in, this is not the first honest match that she hath made. But stay, let me not commend her cunning and counsell to mutch, before I consider better of the goodnesse thereof&punc; I must forsooth pull of my fathers golden haire and present <HI>Mi|nos</HI> therwith: a light matter it s&eacute;emeth to pul of a haire, but alas, that haire containeth my fathers helpe, his hope, his hap, his strength, his power, his conquest, and his kingdome. Shall I then so mutch transgresse the lawes of nature to bring him to a miserable plight, who was the cause that I came into this ioyfull lighte? Who from my infancy carefully cherished, and fatherlye foste|red mee vp, whom by humaine and deuine lawes I am bound to obey honor and loue? No, auaunt vnlawful loue, thou art rated at to high a price to be reached: auaunte foule beastly ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">de, thy counsell is withoute conscience, thy aduice without honesty: they which cleaue to thy help shall b&eacute;e serued as he whiche ready to fall from a hedge, catcheth holde of a sharpe bryer to staye himselfe: they y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> follow thy phisick shal do as he which to heale his ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e, slew himself: they which prouide for their fathers peace and preseruation as thou wouldest haue m&eacute;e to doe, shalt with the Daughters of <HI>Pelias</HI> kill their Father to make hym younge agayne: They which loue their Father as thou wouldst haue me to do, shall with <HI>Thais</HI> to her <HI>Phae|dria</HI> shut hym out of the dores, and out of his kingdome for loue. But what, doe floudes drowne fieldes before they finde a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ack? can one be exalted without anothers wracke? Can I be preferred to pleasure without some o|thers paine. But it gr&eacute;eues mee my father shoulde bee pinched for my pleasure. Why it is reason the greife should be theirs, whose is the gaine. But it is perilous for
<PB N="133" REF="71">
mee to enterprise so great a matter. Why is it not reason the perill should be mine in pursuing, when the pleasure shall bee mine in possessing? but alas it nippeth mee nere to lose my father the victory, to winne my selfe my loue. Why alas gr&eacute;euous woundes must haue smarting play|sters, and those medicines euer soonest heale vs whiche most gr&eacute;eue vs. And shall I then preferre mine owne pleasure before my fathers profit? why euery one ought to be nerest to them selues, and their wisdome is nothing worth which are not wise for them selues. Nay rather shall I preferre the commodytie of King <HI>Minos</HI> before the commodytie of King <HI>Nysus?</HI> why <HI>Nysus</HI> is my father: why <HI>Minos</HI> will be my Phere: why <HI>Nysus</HI> gaue me lyfe: Why <HI>Minos</HI> wyll y&eacute;elde mee loue: Why <HI>Nysus</HI> made mee a maide: Why <HI>Minos</HI> wil make m&eacute;e a mother: Why <HI>Ny|sus</HI> cherised mee beeing young: Why <HI>Minos</HI> wyll make mutch of m&eacute;e beeinge olde: why nature bindeth mee to loue my father: why God commaundeth mee to loue my husband: Ah foole, doe I call hym husbande who wyll not haue mee? doe I call him phere who forceth not of mee? Is it lykely hee will receiue a runnagate from her cittie, a beetrayer of her Father? Can hee think to finde mee faithfull towards him, that am faithlesse to mine owne father? Tush hee will attribute all this to loue, and loue m&eacute;e y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> better for it. He will excuse &amp; beare with my doings by the exa~ple of his owne daughter <HI>Ariadne,</HI> who betraied him to her louer <HI>Thesius:</HI> by the exa~ple of <HI>Medea,</HI> who be|traied her father to <HI>Iason:</HI> by the example of <HI>Hyppodam&eacute;,</HI> who procured y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> death of her father by matching w^t <HI>Pelops</HI> And therfore al doubtes done away, I wil without delay put the policie of <HI>Pandar&punc;</HI> in practise. The night following (sutch hast her hot loue required) she shewd her selfe Mi|steris of her word though not of her selfe, and performed that which shee sayde she would. For her father beeing a sleepe, sh&eacute;e got softly to him and cut of his precious haire which had in it sutch vertue. Which done, sh&eacute;e went to
<PB N="134" REF="72">
King <HI>Minos</HI> and presented him therewith, who in most reprochefull wordes reprehended her d&eacute;ede, and in most disdainfull sort reiected her loue. But she not meaning to leaue her loue while shee had lyfe, leapt into the sea to swim after him as hee sayled away. And so quenched her desire in the bottome of the sea.</P>
<P>You see here, Gentlewomen, she y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> would not looke vpo~ her <HI>Iphis,</HI> coulde not be looked vpon by her <HI>Minos.</HI> Shee that would make no account of her inferriour, could not be accounted of by her superiour. For it is a plaine case, (and therfore looke to it) that they which deale rigorously with other, shall b&eacute;e rudely dealt withal themselues. But I am by this story chiefely to admonish you that you pull not of your fathers haire that is, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> you pul not their harts out of their bodies, by vnaduisedly castinge your selues away in matching in marriage with those who are not meet for you. That is to pull of your fathers haire, when you shall cast of the bridle of obedience, rashly run at ran|don, rudely neglect his precepts, and presumptuously place your selues in marriage contrarie to his pleasure: that is to pull of your Fathers haire. But (Soueraigne) now your father is gone, I will giue you more sound ad|vice: I will admonishe you all not to pull of your owne haire, that is not to binde your selues to the froward faust of your politique parents, but to make your choice in mar riage according to your owne mindes: for ouer widowes you s&eacute;e Fathers haue no prehemine~ce of power touching their marriages: and you are not to know that mariage is a contract consisting of the fr&eacute;e consent of both the par|ties, and that onely is required in the consummation of marriages: and the <HI>Rodians</HI> haue this law, that onely the mothers haue rule ouer the Daughters. But mum, <HI>lupus in fabula.</HI> I must (I say) admonish you y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> as your parents gaue you your bodies, so they may dispose of them. That you requight all their loue, care and cost, at least with o|bedience. I must tel you that if you honour not them your

<HEAD>Curiatius and Horatia.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>CVRIATIVS a young Gentleman of the Citie of <HI>Albania</HI> in ITALY, fallinge into extreame loue with <HI>Horatia</HI> a young Gentlewoman of the Cittie of Rome, after longe sute, and many delayes, obtaineth her graunt to bee his wife.

Whose death <HI>Horatia</HI> most pittifully bewaylinge, her brother greatly disdayneth thereat, and cruelly thrusteth her to the harte with his Swoord.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SUrely Gentlewomen, either according to <HI>Ouid</HI> his o|pinion <HI>Forma numen habet,</HI> Beutie hath some diuinity or Godhead in it, or els contrary to the common opinion, loue is some heauenly influence and no earthly accident. For of euery earthly and mortall motion there may some probable reason or naturall cause bee giuen: as euery ly|ving creature desireth that whiche is good and agr&eacute;eable to it nature, bicause euery thinge is d&eacute;ere to it selfe, and desireth the conseruation of it selfe in it kinde. As the earth draweth downward, beecause it is heauy, the fyre flyeth vpward beecause it is light, the water contrarie to it nature oftentimes ascendeth to the top of high hyls to avoyde vacantnesse. The aire for the same cause often times discendeth into the pores of the earth: as cholerike complexions are soonest intensed to anger, beecause they
<PB N="136" REF="73">
abound with heate, as women are not so subiect to anger as men beecause they are more colde of nature. And so of all humaine actions &amp; natural effectes, there may be some probable reason and naturall cause y&eacute;elded. But of loue it is so farre without the compasse of reason and bounds of nature, that there can no reason, no cause, no coniectur bee geuen of it. Neither what it is, working sutch diuers effects, neither whence it is, proc&eacute;edinge of so diuers cau|ses, neither whether it will b&eacute;eing neuer satisfied. Ther|fore no earthly thing but some supernal power sure it is, as your selues (I thinke) will say by that time you haue harde the History of <HI>Curiatius</HI> who was sodenly strocken therewith as if it had b&eacute;ene with some thunder or light|ning from heauen. For you shall vnderstande this gen|tleman dwelling in a towne named <HI>Albania,</HI> situate n&eacute;ere vnto the Cittie of <HI>Rome,</HI> hee made dayly repaire vnto <HI>Rome,</HI> both in respect of profit, as to deale with marchants in matters of waight, and in respect of pleasure, as to fre|quent the felowship of lusty younge Gentlemen whiche flourished in that Cittie. Now it was his chaunce as hee strayed about the str&eacute;etes, to s&eacute;e a proper Gentlewoman named <HI>Horatia,</HI> sittinge at her Fathers dore to take the aire, and to recreate her selfe with the sighte of those that passed by: and notwithstandinge he had neuer s&eacute;ene her before, yet through the deuine power of loue, he was so blasted with her beautie, that he presently procla|med her the soueraigne of his thoughtes, and gouerness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of all his doinges. And hauinge passed by her twise or thrise with lookes shewing his loue, and salutations sig|nifiyng his sute, he could not be so satisfied but banishing bashfulnes, he couragiously incou~tred her in this ma~ner.</P>
<P>Gentlewoman, God saue you, and send you that which you wish, and to wish that which I would. God Miste|ris may it please you to know that though my f&eacute;ete haue force to cary my body from this place, yet my harte will not suffer m&eacute;e to turne my head from beholdinge your
<PB N="137" REF="73">
sw&eacute;et face, whiche is the cause that hath made m&eacute;e thus boldly to intrude my selfe into your company. But set|ting your goodnesse against my rudenesse, I doubte not but you will attribute it rather to abundaunce of good|will, then to want of good behauiour, and rather take it for good meaning then yll manner. But if it please you not thus frindly to interpret it, yet at least I bes&eacute;ech you not to impute it to my boldnesse, but to your owne beau|tie: for as the Larketaker in his day net hath a glasse whereon while the birdes sit and gaze they are taken in the net, so your face hath sutch a glisteringe glasse of good|lynesse in it, that while I gazed thereon I was caught in the snares of <HI>Cupid.</HI> Or as the Spider in her webbe doth fast winde the litle Flie, so your beauty doth so fast binde mee in the beames thereof, that I am faine presently to y&eacute;elde my selfe a pray to your good pleasure: humbly b&eacute;e|seeching you to account of mee, not accordinge to my de|serts which as yet are none, but accordinge to the loyall seruice which I faithfully vow hereafter to do vnto you. Neither meane I to craue other rewarde for my seruice, but onely that it will please you in good parte to accept it. <HI>Horatia</HI> hauinge harkened to this talke with a certaine disdainfull and solemne scilence made him this waspishe answer.</P>
<P>Gentleman, this libertie of sp&eacute;eche in you sheweth the lightnesse of your loue, for as I haue harde those that loue most speak least, as hearing their cogitations conuersant in the contemplation of the Saints whom they serue, but your smooth tale and fine filed words shew that your prac|tise is rather fainedly to pretende loue then faithfully to loue. And for my part I would not you should think me either so simple as to bel&eacute;eue your coloured words, either so ouergone in lykinge of my selfe, but that I take the commendation which you giue mee, rather for triflinge mockinge then true meaninge, and I promise you I had rather you woulde vse some other to exercise your elo|quence

<P>O good Misteris, goe not about to torment hym so ter|ribly whiche loueth you so intirely, depriue mee not of that sight which doth onely work my delight, absent not your selfe from him whom nothinge vnder the Sunne pleaseth but your presence. And whereas you chalenge my lybertie of sp&eacute;eche, may it like you to vnderstand that though this sodaine loue hath made me loose in a maner the remembraunce of my selfe, and caused mee to bee car|lesse and negligent in all other affaires though of neuer so great importance, yet the beeholdinge of your s&eacute;emely selfe doth so reuiue my sences and quicken my spirits that it maketh all my partes to doe their part in praying for pittie and praysing your person: wherein if I should bee speechelesse, I might iustly be thought to spare the trueth and spighte your perfection, And that my loue is modest without mocking, true without triflynge, and ve|hement without vanytie, I take the heauens to witnes: and beesids let this be practised for proofe, that if it please you to imploy m&eacute;e, you shall finde m&eacute;e as sp&eacute;edy to end my lyfe to doe you good, as ready to spende my time to doe you seruice. Mary (saith she) perchaunce so, for I thinke I shall finde you neither sp&eacute;edy in the one, neither ready in the other. But thei that haue once passed the bounds of shamefastnesse, may euer after lawfully bee impudent, and you that haue beegunne to scoffe and gybe, thinke by authorytie you may continue in it: sutch a one I count you to bee and so I account of you.

<P>Ah the brauery of these fine girles, the more they are courted the more they are coy, the more humbly they are sued vnto, the more loftyly they looke. And if a man practise them in the way of marriage, good God what shew of shamefastnesse will they make, what visors of vyrginitie will they put on, what colours of continencie wil they set foorth, what charinesse wil they make of their chastitie? they neuer forsooth meane to marrie, sayinge that single life is the only sw&eacute;et life, that marriage is in|uented rather for necessitie then for any goodnesse that is in it, that their y&eacute;eres yet require no hast of marriage, &amp; that if God would giue them grace, &amp; their freinds would not force them to the contrarie, they would neuer know what man meaneth while they liue. Whereas in very deede they desire nothyng more then marriage, neither couet any thing more then the company of men. Agayne if a man making loue in way of marriage do but so mutch as touche one of these tender p&eacute;eces, they crie phy away, away, but let one that is married, or one that meaneth not marriage dally with them, why they are as lose of their lippes and as fr&eacute;e of their flesh as may bee: For let a man b&eacute;ehaue himselfe towardes them accordyng to the common course of curtesie, h&eacute;e shall obtayne any thyng of them, for they know h&eacute;e is soone lost if h&eacute;e b&eacute;e not soone lo|ued, but let one direct his doynges by the lyne of loue, and b&eacute;e drawne into great depth of affection towardes them, why they will raygne like princes ouer him: yea they will make him glad of one glaunce of goodwill giuen by the eye: for they know a litle thyng pleaseth a foole, and they thinke him to fast hampred in folly to giue them the slip on the sodayne. And bicause they count the number of suters a great testimony to their bentie &amp; proufe of theyr perfection, they vse twentie shiftes to haue if it b&eacute;e possi|ble twentie suters, some they f&eacute;ede with lookes, some with
<PB N="140" REF="75">
loue, some with promises some with practises, some with vowes some with vewes, some with triflinge some with truth, some with woordes, some with workes, some with kisses some with curtesy some with witte some with wyles, some with fayth some with fraude, some one way some another, so that by their willes they will haue as many suters as themselues haue sleightes to entertaine them. And yet these girles on Gods name are to younge to haue a husband, they are loth to leaue suckinge their dame. But ah blasphemous beast that I am to cast sutch diuelish doubtes of her honesty, whose very countenance containeth continency in it, whose vi|sage seemes to bee without vice, and lookes without lust. Is it likely sh&eacute;e will y&eacute;eld her body to b&eacute;e abused by any, who wil not suffer her selfe to b&eacute;e vsed by any? And she y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> will not enter into modest matrimony, is it likely shee will fall into filthy fornication? No I thinke her to b&eacute;e as fr&eacute;e from folly, as I thinke my selfe far from wisdome who seeme to doubt of her honest dealing bicause sh&eacute;e wil not y&eacute;elde consent to my hastie meaning. What know I whether shee be consecrated alreadie to some other saint, which if it b&eacute;e so, with what reason can I looke to reape any thynge at her handes but a repulse? For as gorged Hauks will stoupe to no lure, so a woman vowed already to another man, the sickenesse of other suters will not cure: or it may b&eacute;e thus, that as the Fauconer when hee first draweth his Hauke out of the mew, giueth her washt and vnpleasant meates to make her after like better of better meates, so perchaunce her pollicie b&eacute;e first to f&eacute;ede m&eacute;e with bitter brothes, that hereafter dayntie fare may more delight m&eacute;e: and now to tosse and torment me with the rigorous stormes of repulse, that hereafter the caulme of her consent may the better content mee.

Againe would I haue her so light of loue to y&eacute;elde to the firste onset? No sh&eacute;e deserueth to bee pursued with endlesse paine, yea and I will trauayle in continuall toyle but her good will I will attaine. Now as the good Spaniell hauing sprung the partridge ceaseth not to raunge the fieldes and beate the bushes vntill hee haue retriued it againe to serue the Hauk which flew at it, so hee hauing once s&eacute;ene this saint sought all occasions to come to the sight of her againe, and if it were possible surely to seaze vpon her. Now it pleased fortune to bee thus frindly to further his purpose with this oportunitie.</P>
<P>Ther was in the cittie a very solemne wedding sump|tuously celebrated, where h&eacute;e by inquiry learned that his Misteris was, wherevpon h&eacute;e assembled his company|ons together, and prepared themselues the same night to goe thither in a maske: and b&eacute;eing come to the house, af|ter they had marched vp and downe the great chamber, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> first masker hauing taken the bride, h&eacute;e being the second addressed him selfe to his Misteris with great deuotion, and when the sownd of the instrumentes ceased, hee en|tred into reasoning with her in this sorte.</P>
<P>Good Misteris, you haue allowed to your lot in st&eacute;ed of a masker a mourner, and for one to delight you with ple|saunt discourse you shall haue one to weary you with ru|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ull requestes: for you shall vnderstande I am your care|ful <HI>Curiatius</HI> whom nothing but the consent of your good will can cure, and hauing no other way to aspire to your sp&eacute;eche, I thought beste vnder this disguised sorte to dis|cipher plainly vnto you the constancy of my good will to|wardes you. And if I could in woordes set forth but halfe the heauinesse which since the first sight of you hath sunke into my breast, I hope your hart would not b&eacute;e so hard frozen but that the shininge sun of pity would thaw it againe. For if plaintes may proue my paine, I haue

still continued in carefull cries: if sighes may shewe my sorrow, the smoake of them hath reached to the skies: if teares may trie my truth, the water hath flowen as a sloud from my eyes. And as these thinges haue passed heretofore to my paine, so if hereafter the sheddinge of my bloud may shew my constancy or woorke your conten|tation any way, assure your selfe I will bee so prodigall therof, that your selfe shall haue iust cause to say I liued only to serue you, and died to doe you good. By this time the instrumentes sowned another measure, at the ende wherof shee began to reply in this sorte.</P>
<P>Sir, I am sory you haue taken so great paine for so litle thanke, for if the end of your maske bee to make m&eacute;e marche vnder <HI>Venus</HI> banner, yea or <HI>Iunoes</HI> either, your successe wilbe sutch that you shall haue cause to count this your labour lost, and that you haue cast away so mutch cost. And for my part I promise you I had rather haue bene matcht with a mery masker then a leude louer, for the one might delight mee, whereas the other doth ut spight mee. And if (as you say) you maske without mirth so assure your selfe on the other side I daunce without de|light: neither can it but greatly greiue mee to bee trou|bled with so vnreasonable a sutor, whom no reasonable answere will satisfie. This rigorous replie of his Miste|ris conuerted him from a masker to a Mummer, for hee was strooke so dead herewith that the vse of his tounge vtterly fayled him. But at length b&eacute;eing come to himself againe, hee entred into this vehemency with her.</P>
<P>O Gentlewoman, suffer not the bright sunne of your beauty to bee eclipsed with cruelty: contaminate not your cumlinesse with coynesse: remember beauty and cumlinesse continue not, wheras curtesy and clemency remaine for euer. Consider that vertue is the true beau|ty which carrieth co~mendacion with it at al times, which maketh men loue those whom they haue neuer seene, and which supplieth all other wantes whatsoeuer. Did

Whiche bounty I beseeche you imbrace both to preserue my life and your owne good name. Alas what renowme shall you reape by killinge cruelly him that loued you intirely? What glory shall you get by driuing into dispaire him y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> was drawen into desire towardes you? No, pitty is the onely patheway to prayse, and mercy is the meane to make you immortall. At the ende of the next measure sh&eacute;e replied in this sorte.</P>
<P>Why Gentleman, doe you thinke it cruelty not to condiscend to the requestes of euery one that maketh loue? Doe you count it vice not to y&eacute;eld to the assaultes of euery lasciuious young man? Doe you make so mean a count of mariage that you thinke it meet for a maide so rashly to enter into it, without sufficient knowledge of your selfe, ignorante of your life and conuersation, not knowing your state, parentes, or freindes: againe with|out the consent of my freindes, without their good will and furtherance, and which is most of all, without mine owne loue and likinge? No, I will haue more tryall of him whom I meane to marry then I haue had of you&punc; and I wil f&eacute;ele in my self more feruent affection towards him, then as yet I doe beare you. You must consider it is not for a day or a y&eacute;ere that man and wife must conti|nue together, but euen for the whole terme of their life: and that they may not for any respecte chaunge, beeinge once chayned together: but muste remaine content the one with the other in solace and in sorrowe, in sicknesse and in safenes, in plenty and in penury. Way againe that the happy life of the wife only consisteth in the loyall loue of her husband, and that shee reposeth her selfe only
<PB N="144" REF="77">
in the pleasure shee hath in him. She for the most part sitteth still at home, shee hauketh not, shee hunteth not, shee diseth not, shee in a manner receiueth no other con|tentation but in his company. Hee is the only play which pleaseth her, hee is the only game which gladdeth her, hee is the field shee delighteth to walke in, hee is the forrest shee forceth to hunt in. So that in my iudgement in takinge a husbande, no h&eacute;ede can bee to wary, no choyce to chary. And therefore you must make a count that ma|riage is a matter neither so rashly to bee required as you doe, neither so easely to bee graunted as you would haue mee to doe. And if you adhibite any credite to my coun|sayle, I would wish you to sowe the seede of your sute in a more fertill soyle, for in mee no graftes of grauntes, or flowers of affirming will by any meanes growe, but on|ly double denialles and ragged repulses. His replie here to with diuers other discourses whiche passed bee|tw&eacute;en them, I wil omit, lest I should weary you with the weary toyle whiche h&eacute;e made of it. And besides I would not you should take example by her to hang of so straung|ly, when you are sued to so humbly: and not to faine dis|likinge so deepely, when in deed you loue intirely. For notwithstanding all his ernest su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e hee could not receiue so mutch as one good worde of good will. At length the dauncinge beeinge done, the banquet was beegunne wherevppon their talke ceased, but his loue dayly in|creased: in so mutch that h&eacute;e fully resolued with him|selfe (hopinge thereby somewhat to bee eased of his greife) to forsake country, friendes, lyuinge and all that h&eacute;e had. And there vpon wrote a letter vnto her to this effect.</P>

Therfore I thinke the best way to mitigate my martirdome, is to absente my selfe from both hearing and seeing.

And herevpon the day of the solemnizing of the mariage was

appointed, but many thinges (as the sayinge is) happen betweene the cup and the lip, many thinges chaunce be|tweene the bourd and the bed: man purposeth and God disposeth, and it is the fashion of fortune commonly thus to frame, that when hope and hap, when health and wealth are highest, then woe and wracke, disease and death are nighest. For in this manner it happened this mariage to b&eacute;e marred. There arose a quarrell b&eacute;etw&eacute;en the towne <HI>Albania</HI> and the cittie of <HI>Rome,</HI> which not with wordes but onely with weapons must b&eacute;e decided: great hurly burly there was in either towne, nothing but war, war, war, the Cannons roard, the barbed horse neighed, the glitteringe armour shined, the boystrous billes and pearcing pikes pressed forward, the dartes were dressed, the bowes were bent, the women wept, the children cry|ed, the Trumpets sowned Tan tara, tara the Drummes stroake vp the mournfull marchinge forward, and the souldiours on both sides marched in battayle aray vnto the field. Amongst whom <HI>Curia.</HI> as one of the most coura|gious captaines and boldest blouds of the <HI>Albanes,</HI> was the formost. But to leaue the battayle and come to the con|flicte which <HI>Horatia</HI> had with her selfe when sh&eacute;e hearde that her beloued was in armes against her cittie. Sh&eacute;e fell forsooth to reasoninge with her selfe in this sorte.</P>
<P>O most doubtfull distres that euer poore damsell was driuen to. For whom shall I offer vppe sacrifice, for whom shall I make my vowes? For whom shall I pray for victory, to whom shall I wishe the ouerthrowe? on the one side fighteth my freinde, on the other side my fa|ther: on the one side the cittie wherin I am is in daun|ger to bee sacked, on the other side the towne whither I must goe is in perill to bee spoyled, on the one side I am like to loose my loue, on the other side mine owne life. So that I know not to whether part, I ought to incline in hart. No can? Why a woman ought to forsake father and mother and followe her husbande. But ought any

thinge to b&eacute;e more sw&eacute;ete vnto m&eacute;e, then the cittie to b&eacute;e counted mine, w&eacute;e beeing both one flesh? But life is sweet to euery one: full sower God knoweth to mee without his loue and life. So that if my will might worke ef|fecte, I would rather wish that of the two, <HI>Rome</HI> might run to ruine. But alas, dareth hee lay siege to the cittie wherin I am? Is h&eacute;e not affraide to ouerthrow the house that harboureth m&eacute;e? Doubteth he not least some peece should perce my tender breast? Yes no doubt of it, hee deepely doubteth it: but alas, they that are bound must obey, hee must follow of force his general captayne, vn|lesse hee will incur the suspition of cowardlinesse, or trea|son, or both. Like as <HI>Vlysses</HI> was greatly defamed bicause hee faigned himself to be mad, for that he would not go to the siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> No god sheild my <HI>Curiatius</HI> from shame, god sende him either friendly to enter into the citie, all quarrels beeing ended and truce taken, either valiantly to venture into the cittie, and with triumphant armes to imbrace mee. By this time both the armies were met, and to auoyd the effusion of bloud, the general Captaines entred into this agreement. There were in either army three brothers of great courage and countenaunce, the <HI>Romaines</HI> were named <HI>Horatii,</HI> brothers to the Gentle|woma~ before spoken of, the <HI>Albanes</HI> were called <HI>Curiatii,</HI> wherof one was y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> gentlema~ before me~tioned.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>CEPHALVS a lustye younge gallant, and PROCRIS a bewtifull girle, both of the Duke of VENICE Courte, beecum eche amorous of other, and notwithstandinge delayes procured, at length are matched in marriage. <HI>Ce|phalus</HI> pretending a far iourney and long absence, retur|neth beefore appointed time, to trie his wiues trustinesse. <HI>Procris</HI> falling into the folly of extreme ielousie ouer her Husband, pursueth him priuely into the wooddes a hun|ting, to see his beehauiour: whom <HI>Cephalus</HI> heeringe to russhell in a bushe wherein shee was shrowded, and thinking it had bin some game, slayeth her vnwares, and perceiuinge the deede, consumeth hymselfe to death for sorowe.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is the prouident policy of the deuine power to the in|tent w&eacute;e shoulde not b&eacute;e to proudly puft vp with prospe|ritie, most commonly to mix it with some sower sops of aduersitie, and to appointe the riuer of our happinesse to runge in a streame of heauinesse, as by all his benefites bountifully beestowed on vs, may b&eacute;e plainely perceiued, whereof there is not any one so absolutely good and per|fect, but that there b&eacute;e inconueniences as well as com|modyties incurred thereby. The golden glisteringe sun which gladdeth all earthly wightes, parcheth the Som|mers gr&eacute;ene, and blasteth their bewtie which blaze their face therein: The fire which is a most necessary element vnto vs, consumeth most stately towres and sumptuous Cities: the water which w&eacute;e want in euery thing we do&punc; deuoureth infinit numbers of men and huge heapes of treasure and ritches: the aire wherby we liue, is death to the disceased or wounded man, and b&eacute;einge infected it is y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> cause of all our plagues and pestilences: the earth which y&eacute;eldeth foode to sustaine our bodies, y&eacute;eldeth poison also to
<PB N="152" REF="81">
our bodies: the goodes whiche doe vs good, often times woorke our decay and ruine: children which are our com|forte, are also our care: marriage which is a meane to make vs immortall, and by our renewing ofspring to re|duce our name from death, is accompanied with cares in number so endlesse and in cumber so curelesse, that if the preseruation of mankinde, and the propagation of our selues in our kinde, did not prouoke vs therto, w&eacute;e should hardly be allured to enter into it. And amongest all the miseries that march vnder the ensigne of marriage, in my fancy there is none that more torments vs, then that hatefull helhounde Ielousy, as the history which you shall heare shall shew.</P>
<P>You shal vnderstand in the Dukes Courte of <HI>Venice,</HI> spent his time one <HI>Cephalus,</HI> a Gentleman of great cal|ling and good qualities, who at the first time hee insinua|ted himselfe into the societie of the Ladies and Gentle|women, made no speciall or curious court to any one, but generally vsed a dutifull regarde towards them all, and shewed hymselfe in sport so pleasaunt, in talke so wittie, in maners so modest, and in all his conuersation so cum|lye, that though he were not specially loued of any, yet was h&eacute;e generally lyked of all, and though h&eacute;e himselfe were not specially vowed to any, yet was hee speciallye vewed of one, whose name was <HI>Procris.</HI> a proper Gentle|woman, discended of noble parentage. And though at the first her fancy towardes him were not great, yet shee s&eacute;e|med to receiue more contentation in his company, then in any other Gentleman of the troupe. But as materi|all fyre in shorte time groweth from glowinge coales to flashing flames, so the fyre of loue in her, in shorte time grew from flytting fancy to firme affection, and she bee|gan to settle so surely in goodwil towardes him, that shee resolued with her selfe, h&eacute;e was the onely man she would be matched to, if shee were euer married. And b&eacute;einge a|lone in her lodginge, shee entred with her selfe into this
<PB N="153" REF="81">
reasoning.</P>
<P>How vnequally is it prouided that those which worst may, are driuen to holde the Candle? That we which are in body tender, in wit weake, by reason of our youth vn|skilfull, and in all thinges without experience, should bee constrained to beare the loadsome burthen of loue, wher|as ryper y&eacute;eres who haue wisdome to wyeld it, and reason to represse it, are seldome or neuer oppressed with it? Good God what fiery flames of fancy doe frye within m&eacute;e? what desyre, what lust? what hope, what trust? what care, what dispaire? what feare, what fury? that for m&eacute;e which haue alwaies lyued fr&eacute;e and in pleasure, to be tormented therewith, s&eacute;emeth litle better then the bitter pangues of death. For as the colte the first time he is ridden snuffeth at the snaffle, and thinketh the bit most bitter vnto him: so the yoke of loue s&eacute;emeth heauy vnto me, beecause my neck neuer felte the force thereof b&eacute;efore, and now am I first taught to drawe my daies in dolour and griefe. And so mutch the lesse I lyke this lot, by how mutch the lesse I looked for it, and so mutch the more sower it is, by howe mutch the more soddaine it is. For as the Bird that hops from bough to bough, and vt|treth many a pleasant note, not knowinge how n&eacute;ere her destruction draweth on, is caught in snare before sh&eacute;e b&eacute;e ware: so while I spent my time in pleasure, assoone play|ing, assoone parling, now dawncing, now dallying, some|time laughing, but always loytering and walking in the wide fields of fr&eacute;edome, and large leas of lybertie, I was sodenly inclosed in y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> strait bonds of bondage. But I se &amp; I sigh, and sorow to see, that there is no clothe so fine but moathes will eate it, no yron so harde but rust will fret it, no wood so sounde but wormes will putrifie it, no met|tall so course but fire will purifie it, nor no Maide so free but loue wil bring her into thraldome and bondage. But seeing the Goddes haue so appointed it, why should I re|sist them? s&eacute;eing the destinies haue decreed it, why shuld
<PB N="154" REF="82">
I withstand them? seeing my Fortune hath framed it, why should I frowne at it? seeing my fancy is fast fixed, why should I alter it? seeing my bargaine is good, why should I repent it? seing I lose nothing by it, why should I co~plain of it? seing my choice is right worthy, why should I mislyke it? seeing <HI>Cephalus</HI> is my Saint, why should I not honour him? seeing hee is my ioy, why shoulde I not inioy him? seeing I am his, why should not he be mine? yes <HI>Cephalus</HI> is mine, and <HI>Cephalus</HI> shall be mine, or els I protest by the Heauens, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> neuer ani man shal be mine.</P>
<P>Euer after this shee obserued all oportunities to giue him intelligence, as modestly as shee might, of her goodwill towards him. And as it happened a company of Gentlewomen to sit talkinge together, they entred into commendation of the histories whiche beefore had bene tolde them, some commending this Gentlemans stories, some that, according as their fancy forced them, but <HI>Pro.</HI> seemed to preferre the histories of <HI>Cephalus,</HI> both for that (saith she) his discourses differ from the rest, and beesids, that mee thinkes the man amendeth the matter mutch. <HI>Cephalus</HI> though out of sight yet not out of hearing, repli|ed in this sorte. And surely (Gentlewoman) the man thinketh himselfe much mended by your commendacion, and assure your selfe you shall as readily commaunde him, as you curteously commend him.</P>
<P>The Gentlewoman blushing hereat, saide she thought hee had not bene so n&eacute;ere, but touchinge your answere (saith she) I haue not so good cause to commaunde you, as commend you: for as I thinke you well worthy of the one, so I thinke my selfe farre vnworthy of the other: but bee bolde of this, if at any time I commaunde you, it shall bee to your commodytie. I can not (sayth h&eacute;e) but count your commaundment a co~modytie, only in that you shall thinke m&eacute;e worthy to doe you seruice: neither will I wish any longer to liue, then I may be able, or at least willing, to doe you due and dutifull seruice. If sir (saith
<PB N="155" REF="82">
she softly vnto hym) it were in my power to put you to sutch seruice as I thought you worthy of, you should not continue in the condition of a seruant longe, but your e|state should bee altered, and you should commaunde ano|ther while, and I would obey. It shal b&eacute;e (good misteris saith he) in your powre to dispose of m&eacute;e at your pleasure, for I wholy co~mit my selfe to your curtesy, thinking my estate more fr&eacute;e to serue vnder you, then to raigne ouer any other whatsoeuer: and I should count my selfe most happy, if I might either by seruice, duty, or loue, counter|uaile your continuall goodnesse towards mee. Upon this the companie brake of, and therewith their talke. But <HI>Cephalus</HI> seing her goodwil so great towards him, began as fast to frame his fancy towardes her, so y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> loue remai|ned mutuall beetweene them. Which her father perce|uing, and not lyking very well of the match, for that hee thought his daughter not olde inough for a husbande, nor <HI>Cephalus</HI> ritch inough for sutch a wife, to breake the bond of this amitie went this way to worke. Hee wrought so with the Duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> that this <HI>Cep.</HI> was sent post in ambassade to the Turk, hoping in his absence to alter his daughters affection. Which iourny, as it was nothing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ioyful to <HI>Cephalus,</HI> so was it so painfull to <HI>Procris,</HI> that it had almost procured her death. For beeinge so ware|ly wacht by herwaspish parents, that shee coulde neither see him nor speake with him beefore his departure, shee got to her chaumber window, and there heauily behelde the Ship wherin hee was sorowfully sayling away. Yea shee bent her eyes with such force to beehold it, that shee saw the ship farther by a mile then any els could possibly ken it. But when it was cleane out of her sight&punc; she sayd: Now farewell my sw&eacute;ete cephalus, farewell my ioy, far|well my life, ah if I might haue but geuen th&eacute;e a carefull kisse and a faintinge farewell beefore thy departure, I should haue bene the better able to abide thy aboad from m&eacute;e, and per chaunce thou woul dest the better haue myn|ded
<PB N="156" REF="83">
m&eacute;e in thy absence, but nowe I knowe thy wyll, wyl wauer with the windes, thy faith wil fleete, with the flouds, and thy poore <HI>Procris,</HI> shall bee put cleane out of thy rememberance. Ah why accuse I th&eacute;e of inconstancy? No I knowe the seas will first be drie, beefore thy fayth from mee shall flye. But alas, what shal constancy pre|nayle, if thy lyfe doe faile? m&eacute;e thinkes I s&eacute;e the hoysinge waues lyke a huge army to assaile y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sides of thy Ship: me thinkes I s&eacute;e the proulyng pirats which pursue th&eacute;e: m&eacute;e thinks I heare the roaring Cannons in mine eare, which are shot to sinke thee: m&eacute;e thinkes I see the ragged rocks whiche stande ready to reaue thy Ship in sunder: mee thinkes I see the wilde beastes which rauenously runne with open mouthes to deuoure thee: mee thinkes I see the th&eacute;eues whiche rudely rushe out of the woods to robbe thee: m&eacute;e thinkes I heare the trothlesse <HI>Turke</HI> enter in|to conspiracy to kill thee: mee thinks I feele the furyous force of their wicked weapons, pitiously to spoyle thee. These sights and thoughtes, depriued her both of seeing, and thinkinge, for shee fell herewith downe dead to the grounde: and when her wayting woman could not by a|ny meanes reuiue her, shee cryed out for her mother to come help: who beeing come, and hauinge assayed all the meanes sh&eacute;e could for her daughters recouery, and seeinge no signe of lyfe in her, shee fell to outragious outcries, sai|ing: O vniust Gods, why are you the authours of sutch vnnatural and vntimely death? O furious f&eacute;ende, not god of loue, why dost thou thus diuelishly deale w^t my daugh|ter? O ten times cursed bee the time, that euer <HI>Cephalus</HI> set foote in this Court. At the name of <HI>cephalus</HI> the maide beegan to open her eies, which before had dazeled, which her mother perceiuing, saide, beeholde daughter thy <HI>Ce|phalus</HI> is safely returned and come to see thee. Where|with shee start from the bed whereon they had laied her, and staring wildly about the chamber, when shee coulde not s&eacute;e him, shee sunk downe againe. Now her parents
<PB N="157" REF="83">
perceiuing what possession loue had take~ of her, thought it labour lost, to indeuour to alter her determination, but made her faithful promise shee should haue their further|ance and consent to haue her <HI>cephalus</HI> to husbande at his returne, wherewith shee was at length made stronge to indure the annoy of his absence. It were tedious to tell the prayers, the processions, the pilgrimages, the Sa|crifices, the vowes shee made for his safe returne, let this suffice to declare her rare good will towardes hym, that hearing of his happie comming towards the courte, shee feared least his sodayne sight would bring her sutche excessiue delight, that her sences shoulde not bee able to support it, and therfore got her into the highest place of the house, and beheld him comming a far of, and so by litle and litle, was partaker of his presence, and yet at the m&eacute;etinge, shee was more fr&eacute;e of her teares then of her tounge, for her greetinge was only w&eacute;eping, word shee could say none.</P>
<P><HI>Cephalus</HI> inflamed with this her vnfaigned loue, made all the freindes hee could to hasten the mariage beetweene them. But the olde saying is, hast maketh waste, and bargains made in sp&eacute;ede, are commonly repented at lea|sure. For married they were, to both their inexplicable ioy, which shortly after turned to both their vnspeakable annoy. For the increase is small of seede to timely so|wen, the whelpes are euer blinde that dogs in haste doe get, the fruites full sone doe rot, which gathered are to sone, the mault is neuer swete onlesse the fier bee softe, and hee that leapeth before hee looke, may hap to leape into the brooke. My meaning is this, that <HI>Cephalus</HI> his share must needes b&eacute;e sorow, who would so rashly and vnaduisedly, enter into so intricate an estate as wedlocks is.</P>
<P>The Philosophers will vs to eate a bushell of salte with a man b&eacute;efore w&eacute;e enter into strict familiarity with him, but I thinke a whole quarter litle inoughe to eate
<PB N="158" REF="84">
with her with whom wee enter into sutch a bond that only death must dissolue. Which rule if <HI>Cephalus</HI> had obserued, h&eacute;e had preserued him selfe from most irkesome inconueniences. But hee at all aduentures ventred vp|pon one of whom he had no trial, but of a litle triflynge loue. I like but litle of those mariages which are made in respecte of ritches, lesse of those in respect of honours, but least of al, of those in respecte of hasty, foolish, and fond af|fection. For, soone hot soone colde, nothing violent is per|manent, the cause taken away, the effecte vanisheth, and when beuty once fadeth (whereof this light loue for the most part ariseth) goodwill straight fayleth. Wel, this hot loue she bare him, was the only cause of his hasty and heauy bargaine, for womanlines she had none (her yeres were to young) vertue shee had litle (it was not vsed in the court) modesty shee had not mutch (it belongeth not to louers) good gouernment and stayed wit shee wanted (it is incident to few woomen) to bee shorte, his choyce was grounded rather vpon her goodlinesse then godlinesse&punc; rather vppon her beauty then vertue, rather vppon her affection then discretion. But sutch as hee sowed, hee reapte, sutch as hee sought hee founde, sutch as hee bought, hee had, to wit, a witles wenche to his wife. Therefore I would wishe my freindes, euer to sow that, which is sound, to seeke that which is sure, to buie that which is pure. I meane I would haue them in the choice of sutch choyce ware, cheifly to respect good conditions and vertue: that is the only seed which wil y&eacute;eld good increase, that is the onely thinge worthy to bee sought, that is the only thinge which can not b&eacute;e too derely bought. And who soeuer he bee that, in any other respecte whatsoeuer, en|treth into the holy state of matrimony, let him looke for no better a pennyworth then <HI>Cephalus</HI> had, which was a lothsome life, and desolate death. For within a yeere or two after they had bene maried, his fancy was in a man|ner fully fed, and his disordinate desire of her began to de|cay,
<PB N="159" REF="84">
so that hee beegan plainly to see and rightly to iudge of her nature and disposition, which at first the parciality of his loue, or rather outrage of his lust, would not per|mit him to perceiue. And seeing her retchles regardes and light lookes, which shee nowe vsed towardes al men, rememberinge therewithall howe lightly hee him selfe won her, hee began greatly to doubt of her honest dea|linge towardes him, and hauing occasion of far iourny and longe absence from her, h&eacute;e wrought this practise to try her truth. Hee told her his aboade from her must of necessity bee fourty w&eacute;ekes: but at the halfe yeeres end by that time his haire was wildly growen, hee apparel|led him self altogether contrary to his wonted guise, and by reason of his haire so disguised him selfe that hee was not knowen of any, which done, his necessary affayres dispatched, he returned into his owne country, and came to his owne house in manner of a straunger which tra|uayled the country, where hee founde his wife in more sober sorte then h&eacute;e looked for, and receiued sutch cour|teous entertainment as was conuenient for a guest. Hauing soiourned there a day or two, at conuenie~t time h&eacute;e attempted her chastity in this sorte.</P>
<P>If (faire Gentlewoman) no acquaintance might iust|ly craue any credite, or litle merites great m&eacute;ed, I would reporte vnto you the cause of my repaire, and craue at your handes the cure of my care: but s&eacute;einge there is no likelyhoode that either my wordes shalb&eacute;e bel&eacute;eued, or my woe releeued, I thinke better with paine to conceale my sorrow, then in vaine to reueale my sute. The Gentle|woman somewhat tickled with these triflinge woords, was rather desirous to haue him manifest the mistery of his meaning, then willing h&eacute;e should desist from his pur|pose, and therefore gaue him this answere.</P>
<P>I am (Sir) of opinion, that credite may come diuers wayes besides by acquaintance, &amp; I my self haue knowen mutch good done to many without desert: and therefore

<P>There chaunced not longe since to traueile thorowe the countrie wherein lyeth my liuing, a Knighte named <HI>Cephalus,</HI> and though the report of the porte and house which I mayntaine be not greate, yet it is sutch, that it sendeth me many guestes in the y&eacute;ere: it pleased this <HI>Ce|phalus</HI> to soiourne the space of thr&eacute;e or foure dayes with mee, and in way of talke to pas away the time, h&eacute;e made relation at large vnto mee of his country, of his condition and state, of his speciall place of abode and dwelling, of his landes and liuing, and sutch like. I demaunded of him whether hee were married, saying, all those thinges b&eacute;e|fore rehearsed, were not sufficient to the attaininge of a happy life, without a beutiful, saire, and louing wife. With that h&eacute;e fetcht a deepe sigh, sayinge, I haue (Sir) I would you knew, a wife, whose beuty rese~bleth y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> bright|nesse of the sunne, whose face doth disgrace all the ladies of <HI>Venice,</HI> yea <HI>Venus</HI> herselfe, whose loue was so exc&eacute;e|dinge great towardes mee, that b&eacute;efore I was married vnto her, hauinge occasion to goe in Ambassage to the <HI>Turke,</HI> shee almost died at my departure, and neuer was rightly reuiued till my returne. Good God, sayd I, how canne you b&eacute;e so longe absent from so louinge a wife? How can any meate doe you good, which shee giueth you not? How can you sleepe out of her armes? It is not law|full (sayth hee) for euery man to doe as hee would, I must doe as my businesse bindeth m&eacute;e to doe. Besides that, euery man is not of like minde in like matters. Lastly, it is one thing to haue bene happy, it is another thing to b&eacute;e happy. For your businesse (sayd I) it s&eacute;emeth not to b&eacute;e great, by the good company, whiche I thanke you,

you haue kept m&eacute;e this foure daies. For your minde, I know no man that would willingly b&eacute;e out of the compa|ny of sutch a wife. For your present happinesse, in d&eacute;ed it may bee your wife is dead, or that her loue is transla|ted from you to some other. No (sayth h&eacute;e) sh&eacute;e liueth, and I thinke loueth mee, but what good doth golde to him that careth not for it? And can you (sayd I) not care for sutch a golden girle? Then may I say you haue a wife more faire then fortunate, and sh&eacute;e a husbande more for|tunate then faythfull. Alas (sayth hee) with teares in his eyes, it is my great care that I doe so litle care, but no more hereof I beseech you. But my bloud beeing infla|med with the commendation which h&eacute;e gaue to your beu|ty, and pityinge your case to haue so careles a husbande ouer you, I lay very importunately vpon him to impart the whole matter vnto mee, &amp; with mutch adoe I wrung these wordes from him. Sir (sayth hee) I shall desire you to impute my doings not to my fault, but to the fates, and to thinke that whatsoeuer is done ill, it is done against my wil. It is so, that I remained married with my wife the terme of two whole yeeres, what time I did not on|ly make of her, but I made a goddesse of her, and rather doltishly doated on her, then duely loued her: now whe|ther it were the punishment of the gods for my fonde I|dolatry committed vnto her, or wehther they thought her to good for m&eacute;e, or whether the destinies had otherwise decr&eacute;ed it, or whether loue be lost when fancy is once ful|ly fed, or whether my nature b&eacute;e to like nothing long, I know not, but at the two yeeres ende I beegan sodainly in my harte to hate her as deadly, as beefore I loued her d&eacute;epely: yea her very sight was so lothsome vnto m&eacute;e, that I could not by any meanes indure it. And bicause her freindes are of great countenance, and I had no crime to charge her withal, I durst not s&eacute;eke diuorcement, but pri|uily parted from her, pretendinge vrgent affaires which constrained m&eacute;e therto. Hereafter I meane to b&eacute;estow

Thus crauing your secrecy herein, I haue reuealed vn|to you my carefull case. The straungnesse of this tale made mee stand a while in a maze, at length I greatly began to blame his disloyalty, to conceiue without cause so great disliking, where there was so great cause of good likinge.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF all the ordinary accidentes incident to the lyfe of ma~, there is none of more mome~t to our prosperytie, or misery, then marriage: which estate if wee aduisedly enter into, it maketh vs in happinesse equall to Angels: but if wee rashly run into it, it prolongeth vs in the paines of the furies of hel. And amongst all y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> inconueni|ences, which are to bee fores&eacute;ene in this bargaine, there is none more daungerous, then inequalitie of estates b&eacute;e|tw&eacute;ene the parties: for, what agr&eacute;ement of affections can there bee, when the one shall bee of a meane minde, the other hautie, the one lowly, the other loftie? how can there be one harte in two bodies, when the one wisheth one thinge, the other willeth another? When the one is disposed one way, the other inclined another way, accor|dinge to the secret instinct of their proper and peculier natures? For the nature of nothinge may bee altered: that whiche nature hath geuen, connot bee taken away: and that whiche is bred in the boane, will not out of the flesh. So that for one of meane parentage, to bee marryed with one of princely race, I think as good a match, as b&eacute;e|tweene
<PB N="174" REF="92">
Lions and Lambes. And as well they will a|gr&eacute;e together, as Dogs and Cats, and as the saying is, the Mastiue neuer loueth the Greihounde. Besides, vnequal Oxen draw not wel together in one yoke, Coks vnequal|ly matcht, make no good battaile in the pit, meats of con|trary qualities, digest not well in the stomacke: and par|ties of contrary callinges, agr&eacute;e not well together in the bond of blessed matrimony: as the history I will tel you, shall shew you.</P>
<P>In the Country of <HI>Creete,</HI> raigned one <HI>Minos,</HI> a Kinge and Monarch of great might, to whom the blinde goddes Fortune assigned a wife of far more meanesse, then was meete for the maiestie of his mightinesse. For there chan|ced to bee in his Court attendaunt vpon a noble woman, a proper p&eacute;ece, named <HI>Pasiphae.</HI> Who by birth was but the daughter of a Knight, but by beauty s&eacute;emed to bee a heauenly wight. On her ch&eacute;ekes, the Lilly and the Rose did striue for interchange of hew, her haire cumly curld, glistered lyke golde: her pierceinge eies, twinckled like starres: her alabaster teeth stoode as a ranke of preci|ous pearles: her ruddy lippes, were soft and sweete: her handes fine and white, yea all her partes so perfectly pro|portioned, that nature sought to winne great commenda|tion in caruing so cunningly so curious a carkas. But as a rusty Rapier is no trusty Rampier to defende a man, though the Scabbord bee of fine veluet: so a woman with foule conditions is coursly to bee accounted of, though her face bee faire, and body bewtifull. But destinies so draue, that this King by chaunce cast a glaunce vpon this gorgious goddes, and at the first view was so vanquished by vanitie, that hee thought his life no longer pleasaunt vnto hym, then hee was in her sight: And fayled not day|ly familierly to frequent the misteris company, for the maides cause. And hauing attempted her chastitie by shewing her his great goodwyll, by beestowinge on her great giftes, by large promises of preferment, and many
<PB N="175" REF="92">
other meanes, and neuerthelesse fayling of his purpose, in pensiue perplexitie fell to parley with himselfe, to this purpose.</P>
<P>I euer heretofore thought a Princes life to bee voyde of strife, and that they had alwaies passed their time in pleasure without paine: but now I s&eacute;e wee are subiect to sorow, so soone as the meanest subiect we haue. Lykewise beefore this I was of opinion, that number of frindes, a|boundinge in wealth, abidinge in health, and sutch lyke things which pertaine to the body, were sufficient to at|taine to a happy life in this lyfe: but now I see, it is the minde whiche maketh mirth, and stirreth strife, yea the contented minde is the onely ritches, the onely quietnes, the onely happinesse. Good God, how vnsauery seeme those sweete meats vnto mee, wherein I was woont to delight? how vnpleasa~t are y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sports, wherin I was woont to take pleasure? how cu~bersome is y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> co~pany, which was woont to content mee? no game glads mee, no daunsing delights mee, no iusting ioyes m&eacute;e, no playes please me, no triumphes, no shewes, no hauking, no hunting, no no|thing vnder the Sunne doth solace mee. And would I know the cause? why, I haue not a contented minde: the perfect parts of <HI>Pasiphae</HI> do so diuersly distract my minde that only her sight is sw&eacute;ete, onely her company is com|fortable, onely her presence is pleasaunt vnto mee. And would I know the cause? why, in her y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> fates haue fixed my felicitie, in her the heauens haue heaped my happi|nesse, with her must I liue, and without her must I die. Why, I haue pursued her goodwil with praiers and with presentes, with loue and with liberalitie, with gifts and with goodwill, and yet am neuer the n&eacute;ere. And would I know the cause why? I sought not her goodwill in the way of marriage. Only marriage is the meane, only wedlock must locke, and lincke vs together. And shal I so much debase the height of my estate, as to match in mariage w^t so meane a mate? as though many princes
<PB N="176" REF="93">
haue not as meanely matcht themselues: as though the Gods the~selues haue not maried with earthly creatures. And for my <HI>Pasiphae,</HI> though shee bee inferriour to me in parentage, yet in personage, shee is good inough for God himselfe. And for her dowry or wealth, what neede I way it, who haue the most part of the world vnder my domi|nion? no, there shall no regard of honour, or respecte of ritches, detaine mee from that which doth only containe the contentment of my minde. And in this minde ment to attempt her in the way of marriage: but runninge fro~ <HI>Charibdis,</HI> hee rusht vppon <HI>Scilla:</HI> flying from one rocke, hee fell vppon another: thinkinge to quench the coales of his desyre, hee fell into hot flames of burninge fier: as hereafter you shall heare.</P>
<P>Now so soone as hee had oportunitie offered him, hee made <HI>Pasiphae</HI> partaker of his purpose in these termes.</P>
<P>S&eacute;eing the onely touchstone to trie true and loyall loue from lothsome lust, is marriage, I meane, if you bee con|tent, to consent therto, to seale the sincere affectio~ I beare you, with the sacred ceremonyes and holly rites of ma|trimony: and as I haue preferred your loue beefore all worldli respects, so I trust you wil return my loue w^t such loyalty, that I shall haue cause to count my selfe as well matcht, as if I had married with the greatest princesse in the world. <HI>Pasiphae</HI> hearing these wordes, was so rauished with ioy, that sh&eacute;e could not on the sodaine make the kinge an answere, but hauing chaunged colour twice or thrise, from red to white, and from white to red, in to|ken of a minde mooued with hope, assayled with feare, and passioned with pleasure, at length sh&eacute;e sayd vnto him. As (most worthy prince) I euer thought my selfe far vn|worthy of any sutch honour, so if it please your highnes plainly to heare the truth, I euer thought my selfe far to worthy, to y&eacute;eld to your desire in the way of wickednesse: which was the cause I made so course account of your curtesy heretofore.

Neither would I you should thinke, that it is the name of a queene, or estate of a prince, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> winneth mee thus willingly to your will, for I know that name to bee vaine, and that estate full of paine: but it is your exceedinge loue towardes mee (O noble prince) that linketh my lykinge with yours, it is your incomparable curtesy which forceth mee to yeelde the forte of my fayth and virginity into your handes.</P>
<P>For as the sunne the higher it doth ascende in the firma|ment, the more heate it doth extend to the earth, so ver|tue and curtesy, in the more high and princely person it is placed, the more force it hath to win the wils, &amp; binde the heartes of people to imbrace it. And as my loue is grounded vpon your vertue, so I trust so to behaue my selfe, that hereafter you shall haue as great lyking to my conditions and vertue, as now you haue loue to my co|lour and beuty: that when y&eacute;eres shal take away the plea|sure of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> one, you may take delight &amp; solace in the other. The king was so d&eacute;epely delighted with this dutifull dis|course, that hee had not a woorde to reply, but satisfiyng him selfe for the time with a few sw&eacute;ete kisses, presently gaue commaundement to his officers, to make prepara|tion for the sumptuous celebrating of his mariage, which shortly after was consummated with sutch royalty, as is requisite in a matter of sutch maiesty. So this married couple, consumed two or three yeres in the highest degr&eacute;e of happinesse. But the sunne b&eacute;eing at the highest, decli|neth: and the Sea beeinge at full tide, ebbeth: caulme continueth not longe without a storme, neither is hap|pinesse had longe without heauinesse, as by this couple may b&eacute;e s&eacute;ene. For when the kinges fancy had bene once
<PB N="178" REF="94">
fully fed, the vehemency of his desire beegan to vanish a|way, and hee began to loue his new married wife rather with reason then with rage: by reason whereof with in|differency of iudgement, hee could now note her naughty nature, which at first partialyty of loue, would not per|mit him to perceiue. For what Gentleman soeuer shee saw in the court, indued with a vertuous disposition and noble minde, shee would with the kinge hinder his pre|ferment by all meanes possible, still aduaunsing the vy|lest, to tipe of dignity. If any Gentlewoman were fa|mous for her honesty and chastity, by some sluttish slights or other, sh&eacute;e sought to slaunder them. So that those in whom the kinge did only delight, sh&eacute;e indeuoured with all dilygence to molest and spight. Which the king per|ceiuinge, and consideringe how from low estate, hee had brought her to heighth of honour, thought h&eacute;e might more boldly refourme her faultes, and began (with se|uerity sufficient, and in d&eacute;ede, more then was m&eacute;ete b&eacute;e|tw&eacute;ene man and wife,) to admonish her of her malitious disposition, towardes those which were of vertuous in|clination: and made no curiosity though without curtesy, to tell her, that shee b&eacute;einge ignoble her selfe, could not like of those which were noble. But to mutch familia|rity had bred so mutch contempt in her, that shee beegan impaciently to pout, to loure, to snuffe, to chase, to thinke her self mutch iniuried by those wordes, and sayd plainly shee would like of whom shee lyst, shewinge her rude bringing vp, her want of wit and gouernment, her cur|rishe nature, her curst conditions, and howe vnfitte sh&eacute;e was for the place sh&eacute;e was in. Well, the kinge was fayn to make a vertue of necessity, and to take paciently, that which h&eacute;e could not take away easily. For sh&eacute;e still perse|uered in her peruersenesse, and hated those chiefely, whom her husband loued especially. And amongest all o|ther, there was one proper yong gentlema~ named <HI>Vere|cundus,</HI> attendant vpon the kinge, and in great fauour
<PB N="179" REF="94">
and credit with him, whom when sh&eacute;e could by no means bring into displeasure or dislikinge, shee went about to intrap by this traine of treason: shee began to cast glaun|ces of good will towardes him, and by alluringe lookes to thrall him in the thread of her beuty. The young gentle|man beeing made of fine mettall, and therfore very apt to receiue the impression of loue, in short time was so fra|med to her fancy, that hee yeelded fayth to her fraud, and requited her fayned lookes with vnfayned loue. And as a pleasaunte praye soone intiseth a simple theife: so hee thought her beuty sutch a booty, that in his opinion, no younge man in the world but would hazarde hanginge to haue it. And herevpon fell to debatinge the matter with him selfe in this sorte.</P>
<P>It is a common opinion amongest men, that h&eacute;e which is once chayned in the linkes of loue, is foorthwith re|strayned of his liberty and freedome, but if true lyberty bee to liue as one list, I cannot but thinke my self to liue in most large and licentious liberty, for that I lust not, or desire to lead any other life then that which I doe: which is, in the secret seruice and continuall contemplation of my princely <HI>Pasiphae.</HI> Yea I thinke euery sorrow sweet, and euery paine pleasure, which any passion proceeding of her beuty procureth mee: and I thinke my selfe more then happy, that the heauens thinke mee meete to suffer any martirdome for her sweet sake. And if I might ende my dayes in dooing her seruice, I should thinke it the on|ly beginning of ioy, the way to life, and the readie and perfect path wherby to passe to the pleasures of Paradise. Oh that fortune would minister some occasion wherby I might manifeste vnto her the manifolde goodwill I beare her: and if without preiudice to her person it might bee done, would to god she were drowned in some sutch depth of daunger, that nothinge but the hazardinge of my life could preserue her from perill: then should shee see the seruice which I haue sworne to doe her, then should shee
<PB N="180" REF="95">
see the duty which I haue vowed to owe her, then should shee plainly perceiue, that neither the pleasures of the world, neither the solace of freindes, neither the sweet|nesse of life, neither the sowernesse of death should with|draw mee from sheadynge the d&eacute;erest drop of bloud in mee to doe her good. And then woulde shee say (if any curtesy bee contained in her) that my loue is most loyal, and my friendship most faythfull, then would shee paye (if any gratefulnesse bee grafted in her) my daunger and perill with the price of her person. But alas, how can she pay me with that which is not in her own power? There is another only who hath interest therin, she hath already payd her person as a price of a prince &amp; his whole kingdome: so that I plough the barrein rockes, and set my share into the shoare of the Sea: I till with toyle sutch a kinde of soyle, whereof another by right must crop the corne. But admit she were disposed to incroche somwhat vpon her husbandes right, yet is it likely shee will looke so low, as let so meane a man as my selfe growe into so great acquaintaunce with her? No, fortune denieth m&eacute;e any sutch fauour, my good will as yet hath deserued no sutch gwerdon, my desire is far aboue my desertes, my ambition aboue my condition. Why, my birth is better then hers, why should shee then neglecte mee? But her calling is better then mine, why should shee then respect mee? My desire proc&eacute;edes of loue, why should shee not then accept it? But alas, it is contrary to law, why should sh&eacute;e not then reiecte it? I am of noble bloud, why should shee refuse mee? But shee hath a noble prince to her hus|band, why should shee misuse him? Yea if I my self were not a villaine, altogether deuoyd of vertue, I would not suffer it so mutch as enter into my thought to abuse him, who hath alwayes vsed mee honourably, who hath sought my prefermente by all meanes possyble, who from my childhood hath brought m&eacute;e vp like a louing lord &amp; Maister. Shall I requite his liberalytie towards mee with sutch
<PB N="181" REF="95">
disloyaltie? shall I deceiue the opinion whiche hee doeth conceiue of mee, with sutche destable villany? shall I returne the trust which he reposeth in me, with sutch tre|son? shal I defile my faith towards him, by s&eacute;eking to de|file his bridly bed? But (alas) loue is aboue lord or laws, aboue Prince or priuiledge, aboue friend or faith. Where loue leadeth no maister is made account of, no Kinge ca|red for, no friend forced of, no duty respected, no honestie regarded, but all thinges done accordinge to the passion which preuaileth ouer vs. And s&eacute;einge it is not in our power to preuent that passion, for it is either deriued of our owne nature, or discended from the heauens, there is no reason I shoulde requier any proper or peculiar fortune to my selfe, and s&eacute;eke to be dispensed withal from that which is common to all: and so mutche the rather I am induced to yeelde to the instinct of loue, and to pursue my purpose, for that I perceiue by the wanton lookes of the Qu&eacute;ene, that she is determined to entertaine some secret friend, b&eacute;esides the King her husband, and if I flat|ter not my selfe, her very countinance towardes me im|ports some lykelyhood of loue shee beares m&eacute;e: therefore I think it wisdome to strike while the iron is hot, and if it b&eacute;e posible to ease my hart of the greif, which her beuty hath bred mee. And if shee be disposed to arme her hus|band with horned harnesse, as good I be the instrument therof, as some other of meaner calling and countenance. After this, hee sought all meanes possible to insinuate himselfe into her familiaritie, &amp; courted her continually with dutiful seruice and secret signes of sincere affection: hee so bribed her maides with benefits, &amp; corrupted them with coyne, that they made him a God vnto their miste|ris: she could not looke out at her chamber window, but that she saw him walke solitarily vnderneath, casting vp countenances which s&eacute;emed to containe humble praiers for pitie and compassion, and throwing vp sutch sighes as might plainly signifie the sorrow of his thoughtes. If she
<PB N="182" REF="96">
chaunced to walk abroade, hee woulde m&eacute;ete her lyke a ghost in such ghastly maner, w^t such a pale countenance, and pined carkas, that it woulde haue moued the stoany rocks to ruth. But the Qu&eacute;ene s&eacute;eing him so fast fettered in folly, had that she desired, and now she left her louinge lookes towardes him, and the more painfully shee percei|ted him tormented, the more disdainfully shee lokt vpon hym, and would not by any signes which hee did shew of his affection, s&eacute;eme to know it, to the intent hee should by writing make manifest his meaninge vnto her. The yong Gentlema~, s&eacute;eing the hope which at the first he con|ceiued of her goodwill, altogether without hap, and in a manner dispairing of his purpose, hee coulde take no lon|ger dayes with his desire, but that hee must know a final resolution one way or other: And beeing driuen to care|lesse desperatnesse, hee feared not to commit his life to a tell tale p&eacute;ece of paper, and beewrayed his miserie to his misteris in this manner.</P>

<P>Beecause (most soueraigne Lady) my duty and ser|uice heretofore hath b&eacute;ene nothinge acceptable to you, I haue deuised a new way to woorke your contentation, which is by writing to doe you to wit, that since it liketh you not to geue mee lyfe, I meane to beestowe vppon my selfe a desperate death, the only thing I thinke which may procure you pleasure: and so long as it may delight you, I way not how mutch it spight mee.

<P>This Letter besprinckled with teares, he gaue to one of her maides of honour to geue her. But true the pro|uerbe is, that fish bred vp in durtie pooles wil tast of mud, one discended of meane race, cannot b&eacute;e endued with ver|tue fit for princely place: set a begger on horsback and h&eacute;e will neuer alight, extoll one of base stock to degr&eacute;e of dig|nitie, and who is so haughtie? who is so proude? for this crafty coy Qu&eacute;ene hauing red his letter, though she were right glad thereof, for that thereby shee ment to purchase his vtter discredit with the Kinge, yet shee seemed to bee in a great chafe, calling him traytor, that durst iniury her eyes with sutch leude letters, with diuers other imputa|tions of reproche, and went presently to the Kinge and shewed him this letter: who in a great rage se~t his guard to apprehende him, but hee hauing intelligence thereof, was faine to flye the country. See the force of fraude and the ende of lawles loue, but marke moreouer the re|ward of her trechery and tiranny. Her husbande euer af|ter this, was so ielous ouer her, that hee woulde neuer suffer her to bee out of his sight, and doatinge somewhat of her beauty, but doubting more of her honesty, he neuer rode forth any iourny, but that hee set wary watche and

warde ouer her at home, yea this furious f&eacute;ende of hel did so torment him, that hee could take no rest day nor night, but his fancy still ran either vppon the~ Gentleman that would haue done him that iniurie, either vppon some o|ther that shoulde be lyke to serue him in like sorte: so that the pleasure which her proper person procured him, was drowned with y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> doubt, lest she would not remaine proper vnto him, and that she would bee as common in possessi|on, as she was proper in personage. Alas, (saith hee) now my ioy is at an end, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> clouds of care haue quight couered my sun and light, of solace &amp; delight: yea the greater plea|sure I take in practising w^t my <HI>Pasiphae,</HI> y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> greater feare I haue y^t others d&eacute;epely desyre to participate with y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea|sure. And the more free she is in sutch fr&eacute;endship towards me, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> more franck I doubt she will be towards other. Ah, would to God I had neuer bene married, rather then to bee thus martired, or els would I had matcht with some sutch, whose princely nature woulde haue participated only with Princes, and whose royall bloude and birthe might haue feared the baser sorte to presume to practise her to their purposes: but my chaunce was to chuse one, who if (as the sayinge is) like, like best of their likes, is like to like better of any other then of my selfe, for that in nature and conditions there is sutche difference bee|tw&eacute;ene vs. But repentaunce now commeth to late, this only resteth to bee fores&eacute;ene, that vnto the greate greife which mine owne conceite procureth me, her abuse adde not infamy and dishonour. And if the heauens haue assig|ned mee sutch heauy fate, as due to my doatinge desyre, yet this at least let m&eacute;e take heede, that with the losse of her owne honour, shee procure not the losse of my lyfe. And herevpon appointed certaine of his assured friends, to haue the custody and k&eacute;eping of the queene: who see|inge her selfe thus disloyally without cause abridged of her liberty, b&eacute;egan to curse the time that euer sh&eacute;e came to bee qu&eacute;ene, wishing shee had continued in meaner cal|linge
<PB N="185" REF="97">
with fruition of liberty, rather then to sit in chayre of dignity, with suspicion of dishonesty. What pleasure, sayth shee, doth my princely estate procure mee, whiche must liue as a prisoner? Who wil honour mee for queen, which am suspected for a queane and harlot? How shall I dare to shew my face in the Courte, when the kinge doubteth of my dealinge towardes him? My lookes haue not bene so light, my curtesie hath not bene so common, my glaunces haue not bene so garish, wherby hee shoulde enter into this sinister suspicion of mee. But loue (they say) is light of beeleefe, and ielousy is grounded vpon loue. Auant fond foolish loue, God send my husbande rather to hate me, then to beare m&eacute;e any such loue, which bereueth him of rest, and mee of renowme, which breaketh the bond of faythfull freindship and intire amity betw&eacute;en vs, which causeth him to doubt mee, and mee to dread him, which maketh both our liues so lothsome, that I wishe death to dispatch ether the one of vs or the other. But this froward fate, I must ascribe only to mine owne fault, and fraud towardes <HI>Verecundus,</HI> who hath now iust cause to triumph that I my selfe am fallen into the pit I digged for him. Wel, I must retire to patience perforce, and hange in hope of some good hap to redresse my woe and misery.</P>
<P>But you shall vnderstand (Gentlewomen) this was not all her punnishment, nay this was but a trifle in re|specte of that which after followed, a matter in haynous|nesse so horrible, in desire so detestable, and in lust so lothsome, that it is no lesse strange to b&eacute;e tolde, then hard to b&eacute;e bel&eacute;eued: so that I thinke my wordes will rather carry wonder then credite with you. For, whether it were gods plague for y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> husbands ielousy, or for her iolity, pride, and subtelty, I know not, but thus it pleased him to suffer the diuell to deale with her.

ioyned to her palaice, where vsed to feed a heard of beasts, amongest which was a goodly white bull. I dare not say shee fell in loue with the bull, least I should driue you rather to laughinge at my story then listninge to it, but surely so it was. Yea shee was not only in loue with the beast, and went euery morninge and with her owne hands brake downe boughes for him to brouse vpon, but, which was more, shee was ielous ouer him: for what cow in all the herd shee saw hee liked best, shee caused to b&eacute;e had from the heard and killed, as she pretended for sa|crifice, but in deed for fatisfiyng her ielous minde. And as the beast was opening, shee would take the inwardes in her hand, saying, now goe thy way and please my loue if thou canst. And taking delight a while in this daliance, at length her lust grew to sutch outrage, that shee felt in her selfe an impossibility to continue her cursed life, with|out the carnall company of the bull. And notwithstan|dinge shee assayed the assistaunce of reason, the pollicy of perswations, the helpe of herbes, and the meane of medi|cines, to mortyfy her beastly desire to the beast, yet no|thinge would preuayle, yea beeinge often in minde to make her selfe away, her hart would not suffer her hands to doe it: not that death feared her, but that desyre forced her first to fulfil her filthy lust. But Gentlewome~, because you shal not enter into colorick conceites against me, for publishing in this presence, a hystorie whiche seemeth so mutch to sounde to the shame of your sexe, I meane not to iustifie the truth of it, but rather will proue it false by the opinio~ of one <HI>Seruius,</HI> who writeth, that <HI>Pasiphae</HI> ind&eacute;ede played false with one <HI>Taurus</HI> (which signifieth a Bul) se|cretary to her husband in the house of <HI>Dedalus,</HI> and after being delyuered, had two sonnes, the one lyke <HI>Minos,</HI> the other lyke <HI>Taurus,</HI> and therevpon the Poets faigned the fable aforesaide: but whether b&eacute;eing a woman shee vsed the carnall company of a beast, or whether lyke a lewde wife shee gaue her husbande the badge of a beast, her of|fence

was sutch, that I cannot (though gladly I woulde) excuse it. Yet must I n&eacute;edes say that in my fancy her hus|bande deserued some blame: for no doubt his suspicion without cause, caused her in sutche sorte to transgresse marriage lawes. For seeing her honestie doubted of, and her good name as good as los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e, shee thought as good to bee naught for somewhat as to bee thought naught for nothing. And surely the experience is to common, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sus|picion and slaunder maketh many to bee that which they neuer ment to bee. But some are of this foolish opinion, that it is simple and sottishe folly, for a woman to deale truly with him, whiche dealeth ielously and cruelly with her: some againe lewdly thinke, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> if a woman cannot co~|ceiue by her husband y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> she may lawfully enter into co~uer sation with some other: some wickedly w&eacute;ene, that if the husbande bee not able to satisfie the insatiable desyre of his wife, that to auoyde concupiscence, shee may commu|nicate with some other: but surely (Gentlewomen) I am setled in this opinion, that no suspicion or ielousie ought to cause a woman to transgresse the boundes of honesty: that rhastitie is the only Iewell which women ought to bee chary of, that women hauinge lost their chastitie, are like broken glasses which are good for nothing, that they make shipwrack of all, if the cabels of constancie be once crakt, &amp; the anchors of honestie slipt: y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is better for the~ to be fooles then false, to be simple then subtil, to be doues then diuels, to be abused then abuse: y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is better for the~ to be barren then beastly, to b&eacute;e without fruite then faith, children then chastitie: that concupisence is only to desire other besides their husbandes, that they which burne in sutch desire, shall burne in hell fire, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> no adultresse shall inherite the kingdome of heauen: that all women ought to bee like y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> matronesse of <HI>Rome,</HI> which knew y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sauour of no mans breath but of her husbandes, like the wife of <HI>Fuluius Torquatus,</HI> who died with longinge, rather then sh&eacute;e would goe forth of her chaumber in her husbandes

</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO make the reckoning without the host, is the way soone to bee&punc; ouershot in the shot: to resolue certenly vpon incertenty, is the way neuer to be in any certenty: to looke for constancy, of those y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> lyke of inconstancy, or to determine of those things which are not in our powers to perfourme, is nothing els but to bee deceiued of our ex|pectation, and to be driuen to alter our determination: as the History whiche you shall heare, shal y&eacute;elde example of both the one and the other.</P>
<P>In the country of <HI>Piemount</HI> had his beeinge one <HI>Pig|malion,</HI> a gentleman discended of noble birth, indued with perfection of person, &amp; perfectly pourtraied forth with y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> li|neame~ts of learning, so that it was dooubtful whether he
<PB N="189" REF="99">
were more indebted to fortune for his birth, to nature for his beauty, or to his parentes for his learninge. But as beautie, birth, ritches, and the rest must n&eacute;edes geue place to learninge, so no doubt but his parentes deserued the preheminence of prayse. For the other are but dim starres, where learninge giueth light. And as when the sunne shineth, the light of the stars is not s&eacute;ene: so where learning appeareth, all other giftes are nothing to be ac|counted of. Besides that, beeside his learning, he was indued with a great dexteritie in all thinges, in so mutch as nothing came amisse vnto him, whiche was m&eacute;ete for a Gentleman: in feates of armes no man more couragi|ous, in exercises of the body none more actiue, in game or play none more politike, amongst the auncient who more graue? amongst the youthfull, who more merrie? so that there was no time, no person, no place, wherto hee aptly applyed not him self. By reson wherof, he was acceptable to all good companies, &amp; wel was he that might entertaine him in his hous. But most of al he freque~ted y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hous of one Luciano a noble Gentleman of the same countri, &amp; in con|tinuaunce of time grew so farre in familiaritie with his wife, that he reposed his onely pleasure in her presence. Yea shee had made sutch a stealth of his harts, that nei|ther Father nor Mother, Sister nor Brother, nor all the friends he had in the country beside, could keepe him one w&eacute;eke together out of her compani. Yea this faithful loue h&eacute;e bare her, s&eacute;emed in a manner to extinguish all natu|rall loue towards his allies, and kinsfolke: Who beeinge (as they were wont) desirous of his company at hauking, hunting, and sutche like pastimes, coulde not by any era|uing or importunity obtayne it: but being ignorant of the cause, they thought it had proceded of this, that his minde vpon some occasion had been alienated from them, which caused them on the contrarie, somewhat to withdrawe their goodwils from him. But hee forced litle thereof, he cared not whom hee displeased, so he might worke her

contentation: shee was the starre by whose aspect he did direct his doynges, she was the hauen wherein he sought to harborough, sh&eacute;e was the heauen whyther he coueted to come, shee was the saint to whom h&eacute;e did lend sutch de|uotion, that hee could finde in his heart to bend no liking to any other whatsoeuer. In so mutch, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> hauing the pro|fer of many ritch maryages, hee alway refused them, as hauing his hart so replenished w^t the loue of her, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> there was no roomth for the loue of any other to remayn with|in him. Now shee, on the other side, whose name was <HI>Penthea,</HI> b&eacute;einge a curteous courtly wenche, gaue him sutch freindly entertaynment, and vsed him so well in all respectes, that, her husband excepted, shee s&eacute;emed to holde him most dere vnto her of any wight in the whole world. Sh&eacute;e neuer made feast, but h&eacute;e must bee her guest: shee neuer rode iourney, but he must be her companion: shee neuer daunced, but hee must direct her: shee neuer dised, but hee must bee her partner: shee, in a manner, dyd no|thing, wherin hee did not something. Her Husbande all this while beeinge fully assured of her vertue, and very well perswaded of the honesty of the Gentleman, sus|spected no euill beetweene them, but lyked very well of their loue and familiarity together, neither in deede had hee any cause to the contrary. For <HI>Pigmalion</HI> knew her to bee indued with sutch constant vertue, that he thought it impossible to allure her to any folly: and besides that, his loue was so exceedinge great towardes her, that hee would not by any meanes bee the cause to make her com|mit any thinge, which might make her lesse worthy of loue then shee was. And if at any time (as the fleshe is frayle) the vehemency of his affection forced him to per|swade her to folly, he did it so faintly, that it might plain|ly bee perceiued hee was not willing to ouercome. For hee deepely doubted, that if by the force of her loue towardes him, or of his perswasions towardes her, shee should haue yeelded the forte of her fayth and chastity in
<PB N="191" REF="100">
to his handes, his loue towards her (with the sun beinge at the highest) would haue declined and decreased, which would haue bene the greatest greife to him in the world. No, hee liued with sutch delight in the contemplation of her chastity and vertue, that hee was voyde not only of <HI>Libidinous</HI> lust towardes her, but also towardes all other women whatsoeuer. Yea, hee receiued more pleasure of her by imagination, then of any other woman by y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> acte of generation. So that betweene these friends was no cause of suspicion, no cause of iarre, no cause of ielousie: but they liued together the space of three or foure yeares in most heauenly hauen of most happie lyfe. The floud of their felicity flowed from the fountaine of most faithful friend|ship, the building of their bidinge together was raised on the rock of vertu, so y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> it was to be thought, no seas of sub|tiltie, or floudes of fickelnesse coulde haue vndermined it. But what perpetuitie is to bee looked for in mortall pre|tences? What constancy is to b&eacute;e hoped for in kytes of <HI>Cressids</HI> kinde? may one gather Grapes of thornes, Su|ger of Thistels, or constancy of women? Nay if a man sift the whole sexe thorowly, h&eacute;e shall finde their wordes to bee but winde, their fayth forgery, and their d&eacute;edes dissemblinge. You must not (Gentlewomen) take these words to come from m&eacute;e, who dare not so mutch as thinke so mutch, mutch lesse say so mutch, for that truth getteth hatred, I meane sutch as tell not the truth, as h&eacute;e in no wise should not doe, which should blowe foorth any sutch blast of the most faythfull and constant feminine kinde. But you must take these sp&eacute;eches to proc&eacute;ede from <HI>Pigma|lion,</HI> who, to speake vprightly, had some cause to discom|mend some in particuler, though not to condemne all in generall, as you shall foorthwith heare. For it fell so out that an Ambassadour came out of a straunge country in|to <HI>Piemount,</HI> and was appointed to lye at the house of <HI>Luciano</HI> the time of his aboade in the country. Now a|mongest the company which came with him, there was
<PB N="192" REF="101">
vne young Gentleman, in whom though there were no|thing worthy of commendation any way, yet whether it proc&eacute;eded of the daintinesse of women, who (as <HI>Pigmalion</HI> thought) wilb&eacute;e soone wery of one diet, or of their wa|uering (who are constant in nothing) or of their imperfect nature (which tendeth alway to the worst) I knowe not, but this lady began to conceaue a very good opinion of him, and in short tyme in affection far to prefer hym bee|fore her old faithful freind. Which <HI>Pigmalion</HI> perceiuing, being in their presence, drunke vp his sorowe in scilence, but hauing withdrawen hym self out of theyr companye, into his solitarie chamber, he entred with hym self into this raging rayling.</P>
<P>O faigned fawning, O counterfayt curtesy, O d&eacute;epe dis|sembling, O hony mixt with gall, O heauen turned to hell. Now doe I perceiue thy frendshyp heretofore was nothing but flattery, thy loue, leude thy curtesy of course, nowe am I assured thou madest of me a vertue of necessy|tye, to serue thy turne for lacke of other company. Dyd I prefer thee before father and freend, and canst thou pre|ferre before me a straunger, whom thou neuer sawest be|fore, of no countenance, credite, or constansy, but waue|reth with the wynd? Dyd I beare thee faythfull and in|tire affection, and canst thou beare greater goodwill to hym, who careth not for thee? who beareth stedfast affec|tion to none, in whom is nothing but flitting fantasy, and meere vanity? &amp; canst thou thus prefer leudnesse before learning, tryfling before truth, clownishnes before court|lynesse, vanitie before vertue? then farewel reason, thou restest not in womans head: then farewel wyt, thou wieldest not womens doinges: then farewel fayth, thou art no womans pheare: then farewel women, you are no mates for me. And hereuppon verily determined with hym self vtterly to abandon her company for euer: but re|prehending his owne rashnesse, he ment to haue a further troyall of her triflinge towardes him, and also to looke
<PB N="193" REF="101">
more narrowly into the dooinges and behauiour of that other Gentleman, that if h&eacute;e could see any thinge in him wherby h&eacute;e worthily deserued to b&eacute;e preferred before him selfe, hee might more patiently indure it. Whervpon dis|sembling his greife so well as h&eacute;e could, hee made repaire againe vnto her house, and there noting her loue by her lookes, her fancy by her face, and her conceites by her countenance, hee easily perceiued to whom sh&eacute;e bent her best deuotion, and who was her holiest Idol. Likewise, diligently considering the conuersation of the gentleman, hee perswaded himselfe that in indifferent iudgment, where affection did not make blinde, the best guiftes ey|ther of body or minde which were in him, were not to be compared to the worst which were in him self: the one being not perfect any way, the other imperfect noway. So that seeing neither his owne worthynes, neither the others vnworthynes, could settle her affection as it should be, he vtterly apealed from her vnworthy &amp; vnequal iudg|me~t, and geuing her the <HI>bezolas manos,</HI> hee altogether e|straunged hymself from her societie. See the meruaylous power of his loue, who notwithsta~ding he neuer inioyed y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> vse of her body, and certaynly knewe that the other had not won that poynt of her neither, yet he tooke it so gree|uously, that she should seeme to beare greater goodwyll towardes the other then hym, that he fully resolued with him selfe, to esche we the company of all other women for her sake, and neuer to suffer the loue of any to sinke again so d&eacute;epely into his harte. And surely (Gentlewomen) this <HI>Pigmalion</HI> may bee a presedent and proofe to confute the errour of those, who thinke there can bee no hot and feruent loue betw&eacute;ene a man &amp; a woman, vnlesse it&punc; pro|c&eacute;ede of some pleasant practise betw&eacute;en them. And if they s&eacute;e any freindly familiarity betweene a younge Gentle|man and Gentlewoman, they forthwith conceiue an euil opinion of their honest affection. Which errour, as it is most grose, so may it b&eacute;e defaced by sundry reasons. For
<PB N="194" REF="102">
how it is possible that of an il cause, can come a good effect? That firme freindship can flow from fading fancy? That the heauenly consent of mindes, should proceed of the bru|tall coniunction of bodies? Which, if it were so, those men (if I may call them men) which dayly deale with com|mon women, should bee very faythfully and freindly af|fectioned towardes them: but it is so far of, that in my fancy after the fact, they rather loth them, then loue them. Both for that a lothsome repentaunce followeth it, and also (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith) men therby are made lesse perfect. So that I thinke the coniunction of bodies, rather a dis|iunction of minde then otherwise. And true freindship b&eacute;etweene man and man, or man &amp; woman, is grounded only on that which is good and honest. Yea, I am per|swaded, that the wanton louer himselfe, is as well satis|fied with the good countenaunce, louing lookes, and per|fecte agr&eacute;ement of his misteris minde with his, as with the vse of her body. Which, although h&eacute;e oftentimes er|nestly desire, yet I thinke it b&eacute;e as mutch to know therby her vnfayned goodwill towardes him, to confirme it with a naturall bonde, and to procure her contentment, as for that h&eacute;e reposeth the fulnesse of his felicitie therein. So, if then a lewd louer altogether vowed to vanitie, can loue without lust, how mutch more easily may a faithful freind b&eacute;e feruent in affection, and yet colde in desire? And as <HI>Pigmalion</HI> may b&eacute;e a playne president, that a man may loue loyally, and yet not desire laciuiously: so may <HI>Florinda</HI> b&eacute;e a fruitfull example to the feminine sorte, to doe the like, who bearyng sutch feruent affection to her freinde <HI>Amadour,</HI> that shee helde him more dere then her owne life, that sh&eacute;e receiued more contentacion in the companie of him, then of husband, father, mother, freinde or whoso|euer: yet shee was so far of from filthy affection towards him, that shee auoyded, so neare as shee could, all occasi|ons which might draw him into any disordinate desire to|wardes her. In so mutch, that hauyng occasion of priuie
<PB N="195" REF="102">
conference with him in a priuie place, beefore shee came, shee fouly defaced her face, and bruised it with a stoane, that hee might not b&eacute;e inflamed with the feature thereof, and diuers other wayes at diuers other times, valiantly withstoode all alarms of lust. Therfore they are no doubt deceiued, which thinke that loue cannot b&eacute;e without lust, neither feruent affection without fleshly fancie. And I would not wish any to iudge so iniuriously of the familia|ritie of freindes, sutch light iudgements, proue but a light iudge: sutch suspicious opinions, for the most part proc&eacute;ede from suspected persons: and they are commonly sutche themselues as they thinke other to bee: for <HI>mala mens, ma|lus animus:</HI> an euil disposition br&eacute;edeth an euill suspition. But to returne to <HI>Pigmalion,</HI> who, for al his feruent loue, beyng frustrate of the fruites therof, and not incountred with the like, got from the house of his fickle freinde, and beeing alone in his owne lodginge, h&eacute;e entred with him selfe into this discourse. Notwithstandynge my loue hath been alway guided rather by reason then rage, and my fancie neuer at any time turned to furie, by reason wherof I haue not been greatly pinched with the panges therof, yet when I consider the common course of louers, and of loue, surely of all punishments inflicted on man|kynde, there is none that doth more afflict vs, then the Iewde lots therof, and the firie dartes of <HI>Cupid.</HI> For all other euils by nature we flie from, by reason we redresse, by pollicie wee preuent, by pleasure wee mitigate, by pa|tience w&eacute;e moderate, by labour wee lighten, by payne we appease, by counsayle wee cure, by time w&eacute;e take away, or by some meanes or other set our selues free from. But this hatefull loue by nature wee follow, it ber&eacute;eneth vs of reason, pollicie hath no place in it, pleasure doubleth our dolour, patience purchaseth no ease, labour is lost, payne preuayleth not, counsayle conduceth not, time tieth and intangleth vs, no, nothyng is able to leade vs out of this intricate Labyrinth: And though&punc; y^e pleasures pertayuing

to loue, s&eacute;eme great: yet who so euer purposeth to pur|chase them, let him assure him selfe to buy them at an vn|reasonable rate. Euery pecke of pleasure shall cost him a quarter of care, for euery pinte of hony hee shall taste a gallon of gall. Yea though the entry which leadeth to the lodginge of loue s&eacute;eme easy, &amp; the porche paradise vn|to him, yet shall hee finde the hall a hell, and the whole house a hateful priso~ and place of bondage. For as Marri|ners y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> vnder a shew of calme wether, co~mit them selues to the sea, are oftentimes with tempestes so tossed, that rushinge against the rockes, their ships are shaken to p&eacute;eces, and they deuoured in the depth of the sea: so hee that vnder the curteous countenance of a wauering wo|man y&eacute;eldeth himself to loue, is commonly so wrapped in the waues of wiles, that h&eacute;e is altogether drowned in the depth of deceit, and hardly escapeth with the losse of his liberty and lyuinge. Wee s&eacute;e the flie playeth so long with the flame, that hee is scourched therwith, and the expe|rience is no lesse common then lamentable, that men dally so longe with dainty dames, that at length they are scorched in the flames of fancy, and the winges of their fr&eacute;e will quight burned away. And then, good God it is strange to consider their case, how carelesly they deale in all thinges, how leudly they spend their time, how pro|digally they consume their gooddes, how negligently they regard their freindes, how lothsomely they like good coun|sayle, how resolute they are in their owne fonde deter|minations, how dissolute in their b&eacute;ehauiour, howe soly|taryly they sit in scilence, how secretly they conceale their greife, how sorowfully they spend their daies, how fanta|stically their mindes are troubled, how feebly their bodies are weakned, what broken sleepes, what doubtful dreame, what vaine visions they haue. And touching their beelo|ued, how curiously they commend them, howe partially they prayse them, how doltishly they doate on them, how wilfully they are blinded in the~, how supersticiously they

thinke of them, how idolatroucly they worship them, how zelously they loue them, how ielously they looke to them, how warely they wach the~, how willingly they serue the~, how painfully they imploy themselues to pleasure them, how readily they run vnder their co~maundements, how obediently they bowe at their beck &amp; cum at their cal, how deadly thei hate their enemies, how deeply thei loue their freindes, how charily they seeke their goodwill, how chil|dishly they feare their ill will, how gladly they take a good looke, how sadly they receiue a sower countenance, how foolishly they fulfil their desires, how fondly thei frame the~ selues to their fancies, how with lookes they shew their loue, &amp; with signes signifie their goodwil, how it greeueth them to haue any other looked vpon or spoken to, how in y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> presence of their ladies they frie as hotly as Mount <HI>Aetna,</HI> how in their absence they frize as coldly as the Hill <HI>Cau|casus,</HI> how present they prefer sutes, how absent they send salutations, how present they flourish, how absent they fade: to co~clude, how present they liue, how absent thei dy. But on the other side, to waigh the dealings of their dar|lings towards them, it makes my hart sore to think, that any man shoulde bee so mad, as not vtterly to abhorre them. For, first while they s&eacute;e a man fr&eacute;e from folly and without the compasse of their cozenage, they fetch many a windlas to driue him into the nets of naughtinesse, &amp; to intrap him in their trechery: and if they perceiue him so strongly armed with wisdome, that their bolstred beuty cannot bleare his eyes, then foorth with they goe about to compasse him with their counterfeit courtesye, then, for|sooth, they frame sutch friendly countenaunces towards him, and pretend to beare him so great goodwill, that hee cannot (vnlesse hee will shewe himselfe altogether vn|gratefull and discourteous) but frame his fancy towards them againe. Now, so soone as they s&eacute;e him reasonably well reclaimed to the lure of their alluring looks, they by and by stop the lure vpon him, and cause him to houer in
<PB N="198" REF="104">
hope and teach him to flie a high pitche, for a pray of litle profit or pleasure. For then they cast very coy counte|nances towards him, yea they will not so mutch as with a glaunce giue any signe of goodwil: but when they haue made him lie so long in the aire, that he is redy either to take a stande, or soare away, they flinge forth a traine of treason, and cast some slattringe hope, and faigned faw|ning for him to feed on, lest his kindnes by their coldnesse should quaile, and so he retire his desyre. But if they see him to be so sharpe set, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> he will stoupe at euery stale, or know him to be an eyesse which wil neuer away, the~ they make him flye and neuer serue him, they bangle him out and bob him as they list, then they keepe themselues out of his sight to make him more sharp, then in his presence they lend louing lookes to other, then they make the mat|ter so strange, that hee is driuen to beegin agayne, and to renew his sute afresh. And the ende of all this is, to sport themselues in his paine, to glory in his griefe, and to tri|umph in his tormentes. Sutch mallice they beare him that beareth them great goodwill. Yea hee whiche loueth them best is sure to be handled y^e worst, for they know he is armed with loue to indure the force of their fraude, &amp; like an Asse to beare any burthen whiche they shal lay on his back. Yea they will not stick to yeelde their bodies to some course <HI>quidem</HI> in a corner, rather then they will bestow on him one courteous countinance, sutch is their ill nature to cleue to the worst, and proudly to disdaine him that humbly desireth them, and openly to reiect all men though neuer so noble, and secretly to refuse no man though neuer so base. And as the Humble b&eacute;e flieth all the day in the pleasaunt aire, and thinketh mutch to light euen vppon the sw&eacute;ete flowers, but at night taketh no skorne to lodge in a Cowes foule sharde: so these dainty dames, in company think skorne to yeelde loue to any, but in corners they care not to practise with some lothsome skullion, or horse boy. But if they think this louer, whom
<PB N="199" REF="104">
they haue so daintily dealte withall, haue oyle to coale their furious flames, and bee euery way fit for theyr fol|lye, he shall perchaunce, after this tedyous toyle, and long sute in the court of curtesy and conscience, be aduised and admitted for a more speedy dispatch of his lyuing, to en|ter his action in the common place: I meane, he shalbe receued into their good grace and fauour, and be now and then feasted with the best banquets in their bodyes. But by that tyme the reckonnyng be payed, he shall finde his chere&punc; so chargable, that all thinges consydered, he might haue fared better far better cheape, at the most cutthrote Inne in a country. Then must the Chaines, the Brace|lets, the Iewels, the Kings, the Diamonds, the Pearls, bee prouided: then must hee buie for euery part a peece, for euery finger a fangle, for euery toe a toy: then must their maides bee monied, their bauds bribed, their scouts considered, their seruaunts satisfied, and euer as they lye open to him so his purse must lie open to them and theirs. And hereof co~meth the spoyle of a nu~ber of noble &amp; lustie younge Gentlemen: yea and the nobler bloude and the franker hart they are of, the sooner &amp; sorer is their decay &amp; confusion. For lyke as the fire hauing stones cast into it doth onely alter their colour and make them black, but cannot consume them, but hauing wood thrown into it, it wasteth it cleane away: so these cousoning Curtizanes, if some hard mettald louer light vnto their lot, they onely alter his estate, and bringe him from very wealthy to somewhat n&eacute;edy, but if a fr&eacute;e and franke childe chaunce vppon them, they wholy consume him body and goodes. A thing surely on our parte rather to bee punnished then pittied, who being by God endued w^t greater wits, should suffer our selues so villanously to bee vanquished by the weaknesse of women. But verely as Spiders conuert to poison whatsoeuer they touche, so women infect with fol|ly whom so euer they deale withall. And I think them made of God only for a plague and wo vnto men, as their

But yet h&eacute;e himselfe was so fully confirmed in this fayth and beleife, touching the fraylty and fraud of women, that I thinke no torment, no not the fury of fire could haue forced him to recant his opinion.

For continuing (as I said before) his solitarily life, sepe|rated fro~ y^r society of wome~, he co~sumed y^e most part of his time in caruing &amp; grauing Images, &amp; amongest all other his workes, he made out of Marble y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> likenesse of a proper wench (as by like) notwithsta~ding y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> new religion he was entred into, hauing most fancy to a feminine forme, &amp; ha|uing fashioned and finished it in the finest maner, he fel to looking on it: and as loue first entreth in at the eyes, and from thence discendeth to the hart, so hee looked so longe theron, that at length hee fel in loue with it, yea he was so wonderfully bewitched with it, that hee fell to imbra|sing, kissinge, and dallyinge with it. A monstrous mi|racle no doubt, and rather to be wondred at then credited: And yet I haue heard of some that haue beene so possest with melancholy passions, that they haue thought them|selues to bee made of glasse, and if they had gone in any streete, they would not come neere any wall or house, for feare of breaking them selues: and so it may bee that this <HI>Pigmalion</HI> thought him selfe some stoane, and knowinge that like agree best with their like, hee thought he could

And that if it seemed good to her godhead to giue him a wife, that shee might bee (hee durst not say his image) but like vnto his image. <HI>Venus</HI> very wel knowing what he ment by this request, remembring also the wrong which <HI>Penthea</HI> beefore had profred him, for that hee loued her loyally the space of three or foure yeres with out any rewarde, except it were double disse~bling for his singuler affection, &amp; therfore had some reason to rage against women as he did, she thought her self bound in conscience to cure his calamity, and see|inge how Idolatrously hee was addicted to his Image, sh&eacute;e

For all is not golde which glistereth, counterfayte coine sheweth more goodly then the good: and it is most easy to deceiue vnder the name of a freind. The common saying is, the chaunge is seldome made for the better, and your owne sayinge is, that of your seruauntes you had rather k&eacute;epe those whom you know, though with some faultes, then take those whom you knowe not, perchaunce with moe faultes. How mutch more then ought faythfull freindes to bee kept and accounted of, whom you know to bee perfectly good? They are not surely for any chance to be&egrave; chaunged, they are not for any respect to bee reiec|ted, they are the only Iewels to bee ioyed in, the onely
<PB N="204" REF="107">
perles to bee preserued, the only pillers to bee trusted to. Wee like a picture made in marble, better then in waxe, bicause it will last longer: wee like the ritch Diamonde chiefly bicause it lasteth longe, and will not lightly lose it bright hew: so likewise, you ought to like those freindes best which last longest, &amp; haue liued longest with you. For you must co~sider, true freinds are not like new garme~ts, which will be the worse for wearing: they are rather like the stoane of <HI>Scilicia,</HI> which the more it is beaten the har|der it is: or like spices, which the more they are pounded, the sw&eacute;eter they are, or like many wines, whiche the ol|der they are the better they are. But to leaue true friend|ship, and come to trifling friendship, consisting in pleasant priuie practises, I would wish those women which deale that way (although they be&eacute; no sheepe of my flocke, yet for their sexe sake, I wish them wel) I mould, I say, aduise them to vse wary h&eacute;ed in ridding away those freinds they are weary of. It is a daungerous peece of worke, and importeth as mutch as their good name commeth to, for if they shall, without discretion and great cause, disclaime a mans freindship, it is the next way (onlesse his gouern|ment of himselfe b&eacute;e very great) to make him proclayme what freindship hee hath had of them in times past. This was it whiche made <HI>Fausline</HI> so famous as shee was: thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> is it which blazed the bruite of <HI>Blanch maria</HI> thorowe out the world. And surely I know not well what counsayle to giue in this case, it is a matter of harde digestion to a man to see her become straunge to him, who was wonte to bee most familier with him, to haue her his enemy, who was wont to be his freind. Therfore I would aduise them to sticke to their old freindes still, but if they cannot frame their fickle nature to sutch firmenes, the best way is, by litle and litle to estraunge them selues from their freindes, to pretend some ernest or honest cause, to pro|fesse that neuer any other shall possesse that place with the~, to promise that in hart they wilbe theirs during life.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>ALEXIVs giuen ernestly to follow the studie of his booke, and the knowledge of the liberall Sciences, is diligently exhorted by his father to take a wife, whereunto though vnwillinge, hee applyeth himselfe, and is matched with sutch a one that in respect of her good graces, he vttereth great commendation of woman kinde. But shortly after, fallinge into lothinge of that which beefore hee most lo|ued, hee repenteth himselfe of his bargaine, and forsa|king both house, &amp; wife, and all worldly pleasures, consu|meth the remainder of his life in Pilgrimage, and tra|ueile.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CIcero was of this opinion, that the greatest doubt which doth most d&eacute;epely distresse a younge man, is to determine with himselfe, what life in this life it bee best to enter into: wherein no doubt hee had reason, for bee|sides the diuersitie of liues which are to bee chosen, there is sutch a confused <HI>Chaos</HI> of conceits in yong mens heads, that our wits are confounded with them, are lost as it were in a <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> not findinge any way out: so that if we chaunce to enter into this deliberation, we are asson<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in one vaine, as soone in another, and so many vaines so many vanities: if vertue draweth vs one way, vice dri|ueth vs another way: if profite perswade one way, pleasure prouoketh vs another way: if wit way one way, will wresteth another way: if friends counsel one way, fancy forceth vs another way: yea some lyke <HI>Horace</HI> his guestes are so daintily disposed, that no lyfe at al wil like them. Kingdomes (they say) are but cares, in honour is enuie, no maiestie in meane estate, penury in pouertie, in single lyfe solitarinesse, in marriage troubles, and tou|ching studies and faculties, diuinitie is contemptuous,
<PB N="206" REF="108">
Phisick filthy, law laboursome, touchinge other trades of life, marchandise is but base, the country life is clownish, warfare is dangerous, in trauaile is perrill, liuinge at home is obscure, yea what life so euer it bee they count it lothsome: so that it is hard sor them to resolue vpon any one, who can frame them selues to fancy none. But for sutch as cou&eacute;t to bee of the corporation of the common wealth, and to bee profitable members thereof, I thinke these two points in this choice of our life chiefly to be co~|sidered. First, that we apply ourselues to that life wher|to by nature we are chiefely inclined, for it is not possi|ble well to goe forward in any thing, <HI>Inuita Minerua,</HI> na|ture not consenting therto. Then, not so to addict our selues to any one lyfe, but that wee may adopt our selues to another, if n&eacute;ede shall require. For no man is so su|rely setled in any estate, but that fortune may frame al|teration: like as no ship sayleth so directly to the wisshed hauen, but that some contrary winde may conuert her course against the wrackfull rocks. Which may bee ius|tified by the example of a younge Gentleman named <HI>A|lexius,</HI> who b&eacute;eing setled in a stedfast state of lyfe, as was to bee thought, yet was hee driuen to change, and change againe. For first b&eacute;eing desirous to passe the pilgrimage of this short life in pleasure, hee auoyded (so n&eacute;ere as he&eacute; could) al worldly vanities, reposing his chiefe pleasure in serching out the sacred skill of learned books, so that stu|die was his only pleasure in prosperitie, his onely solaco in aduersitie, his only exercise beeing freshe, his only re|freshing beeing wery, his only sport, his only play. And notwithstanding hee had good skill in hauking, huntinge, diceing, carding, with sutch lyke, and somtime for recroa|tion sake vsed them, yet hee counted all those pastimes a paine, in the respect of the pleasure whiche study procu|red hym. His Father s&eacute;einge him setled in this so|litary life, s&eacute;emed to mislyke thereof, and disswaded hym from it, in this sorte.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="108">I s&eacute;e, sonne, there is nothinge so good, but by il vsing may b&eacute;e made naught, and true, that sayinge is, that euery ex|cesse is turned into vice.

For you must know, al the praise of ver|tue consisteth in doing, from the which to be withdrawn with the doubt of daunger or trouble, is a signe of one which preferreth his owne priuate safetie, beefore the common societie.

Therefore I thinke good, you leaue this labourlesse life, and to enter into the worlde, and take a wife, whereby you may beecome a profitable and fruitfull member of your country. You knowe the law maker <HI>Lycurgus</HI> valued in a maner with man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e|ars, those which would of set purpose abide barren, say|ing, that hee did in a maner depriue a man of lyfe, which did not helpe to bringe a man into this life, when hee might: and the difference is litle, beetw&eacute;ene doynge an iniury, and sufferinge an iniurie to bee done, when one may prohibite it.

<P><HI>Alexius</HI> hauinge diligently giuen eare to his fathers wordes, dutifully made answere in this sort.</P>
<P>Sir, if it please you, I am of this opinion, that a good thinge, can not b&eacute;e to mutch vsed, and that the more com|mon it is, the more commendable it is, neither is it possi|ble to s&eacute;eke learning to mutch, whereof there was neuer any man yet but had to litle: and I thinke it shame to cease from s&eacute;eking, when the thinge sought, is the onely thing worthy to b&eacute;e thought. For what toyle can s&eacute;eme te|dious to finde the way to wit, and path to prudency, the line of life and vaine of vertue? And for the commodity of my country. I doubt not, but you know, that the studious standithe common wealth in as great steed, as the indus|trious otherwise. Yea who first brought men within the compasse of a common wealth but only the learned? Who brought them from sauagenes to ciuilnes, was it not the learned? Who reduced them from rage to reason, was it not the learned? Who brought them into the society of a cittie, who prescribed them lawes, who taught them re|ligion, who inuented mariage it selfe, which you are so ernest to haue mee enter into, was it not the learned? Yes no doubt, learning is the life of the common wealth, the maker and mayntainer of it. I must confes that those
<PB N="209" REF="109">
which vse trades of trauaile in the common wealth, doe mutch good to the common wealth, but I must say, the learned doe more good. I must confesse that souldiours often defend the common wealth: but I must say that ler|ning must lead them, otherwise they will sooner offend it, then defend it. I must confesse that souldiours often win wealth to their country: but I must say that <HI>Senatours</HI> must keepe it, and the cunning to k&eacute;epe, is no lesse commen dable then the courage to get, and courage god knoweth is litle worth abroade, vnlesse there b&eacute;e good counsayle at home. For what worthy exploytes did any captaine euer atchiue abroad, but by the aduise of counsaylors at home? As the valiant victory which <HI>Themistocles</HI> had ouer <HI>Sala|mis,</HI> was atchiued by the counsayle of the <HI>Senate</HI> which <HI>Solon</HI> had constituted. The ouerthrow of <HI>Carthage</HI> was wrought by the aduise of <HI>Cato</HI> a counsailour. The distruc|tion of <HI>Troy</HI> was wrought not by lusty prowesse, but by learned pollicie.

to study and learninge. For they very well knewe h&eacute;e could not b&eacute;e a perfect captaine, which was not perfectly s&eacute;ene in al sciences and learning. In <HI>Grammer,</HI> to attayn to the lattin tounge, and by it to the knowledge of other tounges, wherby hee may not b&eacute;e deafe and dum amongst those with whome hee shall haue to deale in warre. In <HI>Rethoricke,</HI> cherefully to perswade his souldiours to such enterprises as hee would haue them attempt. In <HI>Logike,</HI> probably to reason with his souldiours in doubtfull mat|ters, which are to be discussed amo~gst the~. In <HI>Arithmetick</HI> to number his souldiours, to deuide them into bands, as best may serue for the battell. In <HI>Geometrie,</HI> to measure the ground, to iudge of the distance of places, wherby hee may cast his trenches, raise his bulwarks, &amp; place his or|dinance and munition to most aduantage.

In <HI>Mu|sicke,</HI> to recreat himselfe b&eacute;eing weary, to sing Psalmes prayses to God for the victory. And as these seuen liberal sciences are shewed to be most necessary for a captaine: so is ther no art or knowledge but ought to be knowe~ vnto him.

to auoyd infamy, with infinite other commodities, wher|with philosophy doth furnish vs. <HI>Cosmography,</HI> to know the situation of citties and countries, to take the oportu|nity of mountaines, woods, and waters. <HI>Surgery,</HI> to beale his wounds.

So that counsayle, learning and knowledge ought to b&eacute;e the cheife weapons and complete harnesse of a captaine, yea knowledge is the armour of proofe which neither Cannon, Hargabus, nor Pistol can p&eacute;erce. And what commodity is in courage without counsayle, may be s&eacute;ene by many rash coustictes of many rawe captaines. And not to touch any of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">esh memory, it may please you onely to call to your remembraunce one <HI>Callicratides,</HI> who b&eacute;einge captaine of the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> in an expedition agaynst the <HI>Athenians,</HI> was aduised by the <HI>Senate</HI> not to incounter with them, but to remoue his nauy from them, till more conuenient oportunity might b&eacute;e taken: but h&eacute;e thinking it would haue bene some derogation to his manhood sum|what to haue retired, at al adue~ture ventred vpon them, to his owne vtter ouerthrow, and to the great weakning of the wealth of his common weale and country. If then learninge b&eacute;e so necessary to warre (whereto many thinke it rather a hinderance, as the french nobility for|sooth at this day scarce dareth deale with it, for feare of marring their martiall feates) howe needfull must wee thinke it to other partes of the common wealth? Can the Prince set forth Gods glory, and s&eacute;e to the realmes safe|ty? can the nobility prouide for the preseruation of their prince and countries co~modity? can diuines truly preach the gospel? can iudges duely minister iustice, can lawiers defend the innocent, can Phisitions heale the sicke, yea in
<PB N="212" REF="111">
warre can the surgions cure the wounded without lear|ning? Can Merchaunts safely passe the daungerous seas without skilfull Pilotes? Can they mutually trafique and bring in necessaries into the realme without skilfull in|terpreters? To bee short, there is nothinge done to the countries commodity, wherto there is not had the help of skill and learning. So that learning and wit is the only wealth of ech country, the only conquerour in warre, the only preseruer of peace. Litigiousnes without learninge can doe no good, <HI>Mars</HI> without <HI>Minerua</HI> can make no good mart. Therfore (sir) well you may restraine m&eacute;e from studye, but you shall neuer diswade m&eacute;e from it. And wheras you perswade mee to enter into the state of ma|trimony, I can not but thinke that the great desire you haue to do me good, doth so dim your vnderstanding, that you perfectly know not what will doe me good, otherwise you would not goe about to bringe mee (as they say) out of Gods blessing into a warme sunne.

<P>The people called <HI>Massagetes</HI> liuinge in mountaines without houses, enacted this law amongst them, that eue|rie inhabitant should haue two tunnes, or fats, in the one should lie the husband, sonnes, and men seruants, in the other the wiues, daughters, and maide seruants, they ne|uer eate together but on holy daies, and may not lawfully

<P>May it please you then to knowe, that <HI>Alexius</HI> s&eacute;einge howe desirous his Father was to haue him marrie, thought it the part of an obedient child, to apply himself to the plesure of his parents, and to enter into that trade of lyfe wherein his father beefore him had troden: where|vpon h&eacute;e somwhat intermitted his earnest study, and b&eacute;e|gan to peruse those bookes, which treated but of litle lear|ning, &amp; in st&eacute;ed of schooles, frequented those places where

<P>As it somewhat easeth the afflicted to vtter their an|noy, so no doubt, it greatly increaseth our happinesse to expresse our ioy. And I am perswaded that al the delight|full things we s&eacute;e, all the ioyfull things we heare, and all the pleasaunt thinges we feele, woulde procure vs litle pleasure, if we had no meanes to manifest the~, or freinds to impart them to. Therefore I will vnfolde my ioyes to my ioy, my pleasures to my <HI>Peragon,</HI> my mirth to my mistris. For who euer swamme in sutch seas of delight? who euer bathed in more perfect blis? for first, what could I haue wished more of God then to haue mine owne Fa|ther the author, the b&eacute;eginner, the perswader, the practi|ser, the furtherer, and the finisher of my felicitie? to im|part vnto m&eacute;e his counsayle, to depart with his coyne, to geue m&eacute;e his goods, to leaue me his lands, &amp; to do more for me then I had ether reaso~ to require, or so mutch as durst to desire? O Father, thou only knowest how to blesse thy children? then what more happines could happe~ vnto me then to haue a wife, whose countenance coueteth only to content m&eacute;e, whose lookes are framed only to my lykinge, whose wordes are only wrested to my wyll, whose deedes are only directed to my delight, whose beautie then the sun beames is more bright, whose bounty, wit and vertue is more rare then to be comprehended in a mortal wight, who in shape <HI>Venus,</HI> in wit passeth <HI>Pallas</HI> her selfe, who is the only starre which giueth right light, who is the on|ly worship of the worlde, the only honour of her age, the only <HI>Phaenix</HI> of the earth, whose gouernment is sutch, that she can guide her selfe wisely in all companies, in all causes, whose discretion is sutch, that shee can applie her|selfe fitly to all times, to all places, to all persons, who lo|ueth m&eacute;e so loyally, that I cannot but like it, who honou|reth mee so dutifully, that I cannot looke for more, who at all times entertaineth m&eacute;e so curteously, that I cannot
<PB N="217" REF="113">
but bee content with it, who dayly filleth my eares with sutch sugred words, that they can not but delight m&eacute;e, who at borde feedeth m&eacute;e so daintily that a prince would b&eacute;e pleased with it, who at bed feasteth mee so delicately that <HI>Cupid</HI> him selfe would b&eacute;e glad of it? O Misteris, thou only knowest how to make thy husband happy. But what meruayle is it to s&eacute;e a good tr&eacute;e bring forth good fruit? what wonder is it to s&eacute;e one woman good, when there are none ill? And how is it possible there should b&eacute;e any ill, when y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> matter wherof they are made, &amp; causes wherof they come are right good? For first they are made of the purified met|tall of man, wheras man was made of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> grosse earth: And as in stils out of herbs is gotten pure water: so out of man was gotten y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> pure mettall of women, as may b&eacute;e plainly perceiued by the finenesse of their fourme, by the softnesse of their flesh, by the clerenesse of their colour &amp; sutch like. The~ for the constitution of their bodies, they are most co~|monly colde, by reason wherof they are most patient, mo|dest, milde, and mercifull, most constant without light|nesse, most continent without leudnesse, neither offende, either in excesse of meate, either in fleshly heate, so often as men of firy and hot complexions doe. Besides that, the purity of their bodies may b&eacute;e perceiued by this, that no corruption comminge by the grosenesse of meat or other|wise, can continue long within them, but that they haue continually euacuation of all yll humours: sutch force hath that which is fine, to expel that which is filthy. And as their bodies are most perfecte, so also their soules are most pure. For wheras men receiue from <HI>Adam</HI> origy|nall sinne, women are altogether voide of that infection, which may be partly coniectured by the excellency of ma|ny of their complexions, &amp; cleerenes of their skins: so that no man almost would think y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> there could lurke any loth|somnes to be misliked of, vnder so cumly a couert as their faire faces are, but only they y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> haue proued the contrarie. But notwithsta~ding this perfectio~ wherw^t they are indu|ed, yet (as things most excelle~t are euer most enuied) their

want not those which want so mutch gouernmente, that they will not sticke ernestly to inueigh against the noble feminine sexe, and amongest the rest (as who is so bold as blind bayard.) <HI>Mantuan</HI> like a mad man, most rudely and rashly raueth and rayleth against them. But his wordes are so voyde of wit, and his railing so without reason, that if hee were aliue, I thinke him rather with tormentes to bee confounded, then with argumentes to bee confu|ted. Before him <HI>Aristotle,</HI> as an Asse sotted with ouer mutch studdy maketh a great speake, sayinge: women are monsters in nature, and he alleageth a profound rea|son to proue it, for that nature, forsooth, alwayes inten|deth to bringe forth that which is most perfect, and ther|fore would bring forth only men if shee might. Apythy argumente, hee reasoneth as though it were graunted him, that men were more perfecte then women, which with all his philosophy, hee shall neuer bee able to proue. And if hee make this reason, that the male is euer more perfect then the female, nature her selfe will quickly con|fute him, who in most of her creatures hath made the fe|male far more perfect then the male. And not to vse many instances, what need wee goe any farther then consider the kinde of Hawkes, where wee shall see the Goshauke far better then the Tossell, the Gerfaulcon then the Ger|kin, the Lanar then the Lanaret, the Spar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hauke then the Musket, and so of all the rest. But <HI>Aristotle</HI> can make a better reason, for that women by mutuall coniunctions receiue their perfection from men, a reason truely with|out all reason. What woman was euer more perfecte then the virgin Mary, who neuer knew man? Then the <HI>Romaine</HI> vestall virgins? Then our vowed virgins, who continued the whole course of their life without the com|pany of men? But <HI>Ceny</HI> forsooth beeinge a mayd desired to bee made a man. But will you know the cause? Not for that shee coueted to bee of the kinde of man, but that shee might bee free from the filthinesse whiche men did force her to (for before she had bene rauished by <HI>Neptune</HI>)
<PB N="219" REF="114">
like as y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> litle chicke being caught by the kyte, would wish with all his heart h&eacute;e were a Kite, and yet the kind of Kites is not to be thought better then of the chicken. But to leaue <HI>Aristotle</HI> his railyng reasons, and to reason indifferently of the matter, what one perfection any way are men indued withall, that women want? Do men (I say) either in na|tural wit, either in politike gouernment, either in valiant courage, either in skill and learnyng, either in vertue and liuyng, any thyng excell them? And first for wit, <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe proueth them to bee more apt in wit, for that they are more soft in fleshe, and we our selues haue a common sayinge amongst vs, that women are neuer without an ex|cuse, which is a sure signe of a most sharpe and readie wit. And if I were driuen to alledge exa~ples of witty women, I coulde recite whole countries, to wit, <HI>Flaunders, Holland, Zeland,</HI> and most of the lowe countries, where the women wittily deale in al thinges, discreetly order their housholds, courteously entertayne straungers, and wisely wield most waightie affayres, wheras the men deale only with drinke, and like drunken doltes lie vnder the bourde. In <HI>Fraunce</HI> also, the Gentlewome~ generally are more wittie in words, and eloquent in talke the~ the men. The like no doubt may bee truly reported of diuers other nations. Then for politik gouernment, is it likely that they, who can gouerne them selues and their affections discr&eacute;etely, their families and housholdes orderly, are to s&eacute;eke in the polytike gouerment of publike matters? For (no doubt) it is far more easy to see wittily into other mens affaires then into our owne: and <HI>Solon</HI> sayth, that they only are fit to gouerne other, who can well guide them selues, neither is the difference so great betweene a priuate family and publike society, but that they which can gouerne the one, may wyeld the other. A|gaine, seeinge in matters of loue (which blinde the wisest men that are) women can deale so politikely, that though they themselues beare great affection to a man, yet they will so handle the matter that they shall humbly make sute vnto them, and ernestly desire them to it, which thei of them
<PB N="220" REF="115">
selues most ernestly desire, seeinge in priuy stealthes they can practise so politikely y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> their husbands, though neuer so wary, shal neuer be ware of it, but rather the more they are deceiued, doate y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> more of them. Is it to be thought they are to learne of men, or any way inferiour to them, in the con|uaigh of ordinary accidents, and matters of common mo|ment? But women are not admitted to the administration of the common wealth: but what forsooth is the cause? For sooth the malicious spite of men: and I may saye it to my self, it standeth vs vpon so to do, for if they should be allowed to execute publike offices, whereby their discreet and good gouernment might be generally known, it were greatly to b&eacute;e feared that wee should be set to the clout and kitchin an|other while, and they placed in those offices, whiche wee now, not so worthy of them, wrongfully vsurpe. And yet to the intent all sutch bright lights should not bee put vnder a bush<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, it hath pleased god to set some of them on the hils of high estate, to giue light of life and good gouernment to the whole world: as namely the wife of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> named <HI>Laui|nia,</HI> after his death gouerned the most turbulent state of <HI>I|taly,</HI> with sutch policy and wisdome, that though the title of her husband to the kingdom were very tickle, beeinge a <HI>Troian</HI> &amp; straunger, though her neighbours on euery side were giuen to spoylyng, incroching, oppressyng, and vsur|pynge, yet shee kept her people in peace, and her kingdome quiet, vntill her sonne <HI>Ascanius</HI> came to ripe yeeres, &amp; then safely set him in the regall seate and royall dignity of his father. As <HI>Debora</HI> for her wit and policy was appointed iudge ouer the Israelits, by whose counsayle and courage that couragious captayne &amp; capital enemy to the Israelits, named <HI>Sysara</HI> was subdued. But what should I rehearse examples of the politique gouernment of women, whereas lawes (the only ground of all good gouernment) were first inuented and made by <HI>Ceres,</HI> a woman?</P>
<P>Therfore to the third point, which is valiaunt courage: wherin we our selues confesse them to be nothing inferri|our vnto vs, in that wee say women are alwayes destrous
<PB N="221" REF="115">
of soueraintie, which euidently argueth a noble and haugh|ty minde. B&eacute;esides that, howe mutch weaker their bodies are then mens, so mutch the more strength and vertue is contained in their mindes. For it is the iustice of God com|monly, to supply the debilitie of the body, with the might of the minde. Againe, how mutch shorter lyued are they then men, according to <HI>Aristotle</HI> his opinion, so mutch the more vertue of body and minde they are endued withall. Like as by dayly experience, w&eacute;e s&eacute;e that those children which are destined to death in the prime time of their lyfe, are farre more wittie, discr&eacute;ete, &amp; perfect euery way, then those who haue longe time graunted them to liue on earth. Lastly, if particularyties might proue a generality, what man was euer more couragious then <HI>Semiramis,</HI> who in the habite &amp; apparell of a man gouerned y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Assirians,</HI> most couragiously? then <HI>Tomiris,</HI> who slue the mighty Kinge <HI>Cyrus</HI> most vali|ently? then the wiues of the citie of <HI>Scio,</HI> who repulsed their enimies most reprochefully? with infinite other, who in stoutnes of stomack, and couragiousnes of minde, haue ben equall to any man, that euer had any praise for his prowes and vertue. The fourth poynt is learninge, which to bee proper as it were to women may bee proued by this, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Muses</HI> the authors of all lerning were wome~. It may be said that the people called the <HI>Latines</HI> lent vs mutch learninge, but it must b&eacute;e saide that a woman named <HI>Nicostrata</HI> first taught them their letters. It may be said that <HI>Athens</HI> hath bene the author of many arts, but it must be sayd y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; <HI>Aspasia</HI> instructed <HI>Pericles</HI> the Duke thereof in learning. <HI>Solomon</HI> was most wise and learned, yet <HI>Saba</HI> was able to dispute with him. <HI>Zenobia</HI> had learned sonnes, but shee her selfe taught them. So that it is euident that women are rather the author of learninge, then any way inferiour to men in learning. The last poynt is vertuous life. Alas it gr&eacute;eueth m&eacute;e to thinke how far we come behinde in this comparison. How straunge is it to heare a woman to b&eacute;e a swearer, a stealer, a murtherer, a traytor, a rebel, an extorcioner, a per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">urer, a cosener, or any sutch like&punc; To our shame I speake

it, we wallow in those wickednesses. How hard againe is it to finde a man of co~tinent co~uersation, of modest manners, of milde minde, of gentle disposition, of curteous inclinatio~, of pitifull hart? To their praise I speake it, women abound in those vertues. So that to speake indifferently, b&eacute;etw&eacute;ene the life of men and women, is as mutch difference as bee|tweene light and darknesse, beetween vertue and vice, bee|tweene God and the diuell. Therfore, s&eacute;eing women excell men in perfection of body &amp; soule, in wit and gouernment, in courage, in learning, in life &amp; conuersation, what mer|ueile is it if my misteris make mee happie? what wonder is it if she winne mee to her wil? what m&eacute;ede do I deserue, if I serue her all the daies of my life? For duty no doubte is due vnto her, and I thinke my seruice not sufficient to shew the goodwil which I am bounde to beare her.</P>
<P>You haue harde (Gentlewomen) what praise <HI>Alexius</HI> for his misteris sake hath bestowed vppon you all, whiche I doubt wil driue you into so good an opinio~ of your selues, that you will thinke so meane a man as my selfe not wor|thy of your company: but I would wish you to take h&eacute;ede, for in so doyng you might shew your selues to want that wit and curtesie whiche <HI>Alexius</HI> hath attributed vnto you, and if you prooue him false in one poynte, it is as likely he hath lyed in all the rest. But to speake my fancie fr&eacute;ely of the praise which hee hath geuen you, though some particu|ler examples b&eacute;e so manifestly true, that all the world doth acknowledge them, yet his general reasons are altogether sophisticall and full of fallacies, set forth without any liue|ly colour, only with fayning &amp; painting: and the fine Mar|ble you know needeth no painting, that is n&eacute;edfull only for ragged walles. I meane not that h&eacute;e ment women were ragged walles, and therfore painted them out in sutch sort, but surely the sequele of his dooings was sutch, that it eui|dently appeared hee thought not so well of women in d&eacute;ede as h&eacute;e set foorth in wordes. For hauing (as I sayd b&eacute;efore) often saide his lesson of the coniunction of cases &amp; genders together vpon the booke, and either s&eacute;eing it impossible to

attaine it without the booke, either b&eacute;einge wery with the often repetition of it, either seing there was no end in it, or els b&eacute;eing desirous to learne farther and take foorth a new lesson, he left this lesson with dispaire, and proc&eacute;eded to the declensons, hee beganne now to decline, which lesson hee sayde to himselfe in this sort.</P>
<P>Good God I s&eacute;e there is satietie of all thinges, &amp; Hony it selfe, if one haue to mutch of it, s&eacute;emeth nothing sw&eacute;ete vnto him.

How is my lust turned to lothsomenesse? but what shoulde be the cause of this sodaine alteration? The beauty of my misteris blazeth as brightly as euer it did, her affec|tion towards me is as feruent as euer it was, and my flesh as apt to follow folly as euer it was.

<P>Euer after this, this Gentleman gaue himself to sutch godlynesse, that he gaue ouer all vaine delights of the flesh, reposing his cheifest pleasure in diuine contemplations: and seeing the sight of his sweet Misteris to be a great hin|derance to his heauenly cogitations, h&eacute;e altogether separa|ted himself from her companie, left freindes and country, and spent the remaindour of his life in pilgrimage &amp; trauel.</P>
