<HEAD>To the Christian Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is some time since (good Chri|stian Reader) that lying in London, and preaching at Paules Crosse, as the feast of Easter drawing neer did admonish mee, I made choice to speake of the redemption of man|kinde by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus. And because that Citie then had, and yet hath, as manie learned and religious preachers; so some conceited and too much addicted to nouelties, who spared not in their Catechisings and readings, to vrge the suffering of the <HI>verie paines of hell</HI> in the soul of Christ on the crosse, as the chiefest part, and maine ground of our Redemption by Christ: I, finding how fast that opinion had increased, since it was first deui|sed, and doubting where it would end, thought it my dutie publikelie to warne them that were forward in defending this fansie, to take heed how farre they wa|ded in that late sprong speculation: For as these words of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psa. 18. &amp; 116</NOTE> <HI>Dauid, The sorrowes of hell besieged me,</HI> and these of<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ionas. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Ionas, Out of the belly of hel I cried, &amp; thou heardest my voice,</HI> may be tolerablie applied to Christ, if they be metaphorically interpreted of Christ, as the scriptures meane them in <HI>Dauid</HI> and <HI>Ionas</HI>; so if wee grow from the figuratiue vse of the worde HELL, to the proper signification thereof, and rise from the degrees of sor|rowes
<PB REF="3">
and feares, which pursue the Saints in this life, to the highest sense and suffering of ALL, and THE VE|RIE SAME paines and punishments which the dam|ned do and shall endure for euer; freeing Christ from nothing but from the place and continuance of hell: vve make not a curious and superfluous, but an erro|neous and daungerous addition to the mysterie of our Saluation.</P>
<P>The better to slacke their inconsiderate heate, I laboured to prooue these foure pointes vnto them. First that it was no where recorded in the holie Scriptures, nor iustlie to bee con|cluded by the Scriptures, that Christ suffe|red the true paines of hell; and so the Con|sciences of the faythfull coulde not iustlie bee for|ced to the necessarie beleeuing of anie such strange assertion. Secondlie, that as the Scriptures describe to vs the paines of the damned and of hell; there are manie terrors and torments, which, without euident impietie, cannot be ascribed to the Sonne of God, as namely <HI>extreame Darkenesse, Desperation, Confu|sion, vtter separation, reiection and exclusion</HI> from the grace, fauour, and kingdome of God; <HI>remem|brance</HI> of sinne <HI>gnawing</HI> the conscience, <HI>horrour</HI> of Diuels tormented and tormenting, and <HI>flame</HI> of <HI>fire</HI> intolerablie burning both bodie and soule. Thirdlie, that the death and bloud of Christ Iesus were eui|dentlie, frequentlie, constantlie set downe in the writinges of the Apostles as the sufficient price of our Redemption, and true meane of our reconcili|ation to God; and the verie same proposed in the
<PB REF="3">
<HI>figures,</HI> resembled in the <HI>sacrifices</HI> of the Lawe, and sealed with the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of the new Testament as the verie grounde worke of our saluation by Christ; and so haue beene receaued and beleeued in the Church of God fourteene hundred yeares, before anie man euer made mention of hell paines to bee suffered in the soule of Christ. Lastlie, where the Scriptures are plaine and pregnant, that Christ <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1. Corin. 13.</NOTE> DIED: <HI>for our sinnes,</HI> and by his <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Hebre. 2</NOTE> DEATH, <HI>destroi|ed him that had power of death, euen the Diuell, and reconciled vs, when we were strangers and enemies,</HI> IN THE<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Colos. 1.</NOTE> BODIE OF HIS FLESH THROVGH DEATH, (for wee are <HI>reconciled to God, by the</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Rom 5.</NOTE> DEATH <HI>of his sonne, and sanctified by</HI> THE OFFERING OF THE <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Hebr. 10.</NOTE> BO|DIE <HI>of Iesus Christ</HI> once, who <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">1. Pet. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>himselfe bare our sinnes in his</HI> BODIE <HI>on the Tree</HI>: where hee <HI>was put to death concerning the</HI> FLESH;) Besides that the holie Ghost in these places by expresse wordes nameth the bodilie death of Christ as the meane of our redemp|tion and reconciliation to God: no considerate di|uine might affirme or imagine Christ suffered the Death of the soule; for so much as the Death of the soule must exclude Christ from the <HI>grace, spirit,</HI> and <HI>life</HI> of God; and leaue in him neither <HI>faith, hope,</HI> nor <HI>loue, sanctitie,</HI> nor <HI>innocencie</HI>; which God forbid anie Christian man shoulde so much as dreame. Wee shoulde therefore do well to reuerence the ma|nifest wordes of Gods Spirit in so high a pointe of Religion, and suffer our selues as schollers to bee taught by the leader into all trueth, what to beleeue and confesse in the mystery of our redemp|tion, and not to controle or correct the doctrine so
<PB REF="4">
cleerelie deliuered in the Scriptures, so consonantlie retained of all learned and vnlearned in the Church of Christ, for so many hundred yeares. And if anie man to maintaine his deuise woulde inuent a newe hell and another death of the soule, then either scrip|tures or fathers euer heard or spake of, they shoulde keepe their inuentions to themselues; it sufficed me to beleeue what I read, and consequently not to be|leeue what I did not read in the word of God, which is and ought to be the foundation of our faith.</P>
<P>Thus farre I purposed, when I first entered, by Gods grace to proceede in this cause, according to y^e simple vnderstanding wherwith god hath endued me for the good of his Church. The article of the Creed, Christ DESCENDED INTO HELL I meant not to meddle with; choosing rather to leaue y^t vntouched, then to presse any sense as a point of faith, for vvhich I had not so full and faire warrant, as for the redemption of man by the death and blood of Christ Iesus; but the vehe|mencie of some contradicting that I taught, and the importunitie of others requesting to knowe what they might safelie beleeue of that article, made mee to alter my minde. For whe~ some vrged, others doub|ted, that if Christ did not suffer the paines of hell whiles he hung on the Crosse, that part of the Creed was added in vaine; and the wordes of <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Psal. 16.</NOTE><HI>Dauid, Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell,</HI> applied by <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Acts 2.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> vnto Christ in the second of the <HI>Acts,</HI> could hardly haue any good construction: (because it seemed farre fet, and altogither repugnant to the proper signification of the wordes, to take the <HI>soule</HI> for the <HI>bodie,</HI> and <HI>hell</HI> for the <HI>graue</HI>; and as for the locall descent of Christ
<PB REF="4">
to hell after death, they counted that but a fable:) I was forced to promise that I would openlie deliuer, which I thought was the likeliest and safest sense, as well of that article in the Creede, as of those wordes of <HI>Dauid,</HI> fulfilled in the person of our Sauiour. This occasion drew mee to the next question of Christes descent to hell. Wherin I resolued as by perusing the later part of this treatise will better appeare, that Christs descent to the verie place of hell after his death, did best concord both with the Creede, and with the truth of Christian religion, so we tooke care not to swarue fro~ the Scriptures, in setting downe the cause why he went thither: which was to ouerthrow &amp; destroy the kingdom &amp; might of Satan in the place of his greatest strength, euen in hel, and as our head to free all his members from daunger and feare of com|ming thither: the sorrowes and terrors whereof hee loosed vvith his presence, treading them vnder his feete, and rose againe into a blessed and immortall life, leading captiuitie captiue, and taking from hell and Satan all povver to preuaile against his elect.</P>
<P>Both these resolutions that Christ suffered <HI>not the true paines of hell in his soule on the crosse</HI>; and that hee <HI>personallie conquered</HI> and disarmed the <HI>powers</HI> and terrours <HI>thereof before his resurrection</HI>; some (as in such cases is common) misremembred, some miscon|strued, and some misliked: vvhereupon I vvas both aduised and intreated by men of greater place then I vvill name, to put the effect of that vvhich I had deliuered in vvriting, that by mine ovvne vvords, and not by other mens conceits or reports, the learned might iudge of the doctrine. Which I did that verie
<PB REF="5">
Summer, and had it readie for the presse before Bartle|mewtide, but that the Parliament of States appro|ching, wherein men shoulde be otherwise imploied; and a great hurle raised against it by certaine popular preachers in that citie, through whose mouthes the contrarie had often passed to the people as currant, I was desired by the same persons againe to staie, till that time of businesse were ouer past, that heat of con|tradiction somewhat alaied, and respite giuen that it might be tra~slated into Latin, which also is now per|formed, as wel as published in English. To whole cou~|sell I yeelded, referring the time wholy to their iudge|ments, notwithstanding I were by many traduced in many places as a teacher of strange and false doctrine. But I haue beene and am the more willing to beare the reproches of maligners, because I seeke not my selfe heerein, but that the church of Christ heere in Englande should hold fast that ancient and sure foun|dation of faith which hitherto it hath kept; and pro|fesse that doctrine touching our Redemption by Christ, which as wel the publike lawes of this realme, as all the catholike fathers do vphold and allow.</P>
<P>In setting downe the summe of that which I prea|ched, I neither do, nor can promise thee (gentle Rea|der) the same words which I then spake; I wrote them not; but I assure thee before him that knoweth all things, that I haue not swarued nor altered anie ma|teriall point from the methode, propositions, proofes and conclusions, which I then vsed, nor from the wordes as farre as either my notes, or my memory vpon the fresh foote coulde direct mee; which I haue yet to shew. Manie proofes and authorities I omitted
<PB REF="5">
in the pulpit, which the time shut me from; and some obiections I haue answered here more largelie, then the course of Sermons would permit: but here is the selfe same in effect, which then I vttered and purpo|sed, if the time woulde haue suffered. The manner of handling this question, I alwaies wished might bee temperate and sober, as best became christian profes|sours and teachers; least by catching aduantages be|sides the cause, wee increased quarrels, and so much regarded our credits that wee neglected the truth. I haue therfore in the Treatise it selfe touched no mans name, oppugned no mans wordes, traduced no mans iudgement; but admitting and retaining as much as I thought might stande with the truth, I haue pared off certaine extremities, and reiected certaine addi|tions, which the first inuentors did refraine; for that Christ suffered the death of the soule, or all the same tormentes, which the damned do and shall, are posi|tions lately coined, and deriued from the proportion of Gods iustice as they call it, but as I thinke from pre|sumption of mans reason intruding into Gods secrets. The doctrine which I defend, that we are sufficientlie redeemed by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus, (without adding of hell paines to bee suffered in the soule of Christ) hath the constant, full, and expresse warrant of the Scriptures, and the like approbation from al the fathers without exception. And therefore howsoeuer some men may despise all ancient writers, and frustrate the scriptures with their figures; al sober and wise christians will, I doubt not, beware how they admit this strange and late found nouelty into their Creede or consciences. The second point I presse nor
<PB REF="6">
with like vehemencie, because it hath not like certain|tie. So long as we confesse (which the Scriptures do confirme) that Christs humane nature after his ex|treame humiliation on the Crosse, &amp; before his resur|rection, conquered &amp; spoyled not death only, but hell &amp; Satan also, of al their power &amp; right ouer y^e faithful, &amp; ascending on hie <HI>lead captiuitie captiue,</HI> &amp; tooke the <HI>keyes of death and of hell</HI> into his owne hands; with the precise maner and hower I will not burden anie mans conscience, that cannot be perswaded by reading the latter part of this treatise; though I my selfe, after long &amp; diligent search, find no sense so agreeable to y^e words of the Creede, so answerable to the rules of the sacred Scriptures, and so fullie followed by all the Fathers, as Christs descent to the verie place of hell for the purposes aforesaid.</P>
<P>Hauing premonished thee (Christian reader) of thus much, I am not willing to detayne thee anie longer from vewing and examining the booke it selfe, but onelie to tell thee that whiles I stayed the printing hereof, till others did like it, as wel as my self, one more hastie then either aduised or learned, calling himselfe H. I. would needes traduce it and confute it before he saw it, resting belike on such notes, as his angry mind and brickle memorie tooke at the time when I preached of these points. Wherein though others condemne his follie, yet I commend his pollicie, that least hee should trouble himselfe with more the~ he could answere, he thought it y^e best way to come into the field alone, and like a stout Champion fighting with his owne shadow, to say no more the~ he would be sure to deny or decline with one
<PB REF="6">
shift or other. To make the easier conquest of that I preached, hee cleane changeth the state of the first Question, hee offereth to prooue that which I neuer denied, hee confuteth that which I ne|uer affirmed, hee runneth at Random no man can tell whither, hee peruerteth my wordes, hee may|meth my reasons, hee skippeth all my authori|ties; hee scornefullie reiecteth the iudgement of the Fathers when I alleage them, the Scriptures hee turneth and windeth at his pleasure, he wadeth desperately through thicke and thinne in matters of most importance, his best reason is euerie where his own opinion, outfacing the world with his ignorance; in summe, he sheweth vs by his example what it is for a man in matters of faith to despise both authoritie and antiquity, and trust onely to his own fancie. Such an opponent the wiser sort will thinke I were better neglect then encounter, which resolution I my selfe do retayne; onely lest my silence should augment his boldnes, I thought it not amisse in the conclusion se|uered from the treatise, to giue thee a tast of the rash|nes and weaknes of his enterprise, intreating thee in the meane time to reade aduisedly and iudge indiffe|rently, for that the cause is weighty and toucheth thee as neere as mee. For if we suffer the mayne foundation of our faith and hope in Christ to be wrenched neuer so little awrie; the whole building is more endangered then wee are ware of. In Gods causes, let Gods booke teach vs what to beleeue, and what to professe. If thou thinke it thy duetie in matters of faith to be|ware of vnwritten verities, in the greatest point of all, which is our redemption by Christ; take heede
<PB REF="7">
thou easilie admit not vnwritten absurdities. This matter began in more generall and more tolerable tearmes, if they might bee rather soberly mitigated, then too vehemently pressed; but as when we runne downe an hill we can hardly staie; so in matters of re|ligion when we fal to inuenting beyond the scriptures we quickly misse and seldome recouer the truth. Fare|well (gentle Reader) and pray that our thoughts and wits may be subiected to the truth of Gods word, and that wee loath not the simplicitie which is in Christ.</P>

they tooke the Apostles to be. The Iewes hauing their eares full of those excellent promises, which God made by his pro|phets, concerning the kingdome of the Messias, and refer|ring them to an earthlie king, that should sit on the throne of <HI>Dauid,</HI> brusing his enemies with a rod of Iron, and ru|ling the world with iustice and equitie: when they sawe the weake and base condition of our Sauiour, in outward shew promising nothing but reproch and penurie; they so disdai|ned and detested him, that they could not bee quiet, till they had crucified him; being then, and euer since ashamed, and gr&eacute;eued that anie should saie, or thinke, he was the Messias, so much spoken of in the prophets. Thus the Iewes looking for <HI>wonders,</HI> and the Grecians for <HI>Wisedome,</HI> did both con|demne the crosse of Christ: the one of weakenesse, the other of foolishnesse: and for that cause fell at the <HI>stone of offence</HI>: but such as were called both Iewes and Gentiles to bee heires of the promise, did plainelie perceaue, and fullie con|fesse Christ crucified to be the mightie power, and manifold wisedome of God for their euerlasting ioie and blisse; and were so far from being ashamed of Christs sufferings,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What it is to the beleeuers.</HI></NOTE> that they were willing partakers and open reioicers in the crosse of Christ, as the Apostle here saieth of himselfe. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Galath.</HI> 6</NOTE> <HI>Be it farre from mee to reioice, but in the Crosse of Christ, by which the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</HI> And ind&eacute;ede if we beholde Christ crucified with carnall eies, as did the Iewes, wee shall see nothing in him but earthlie weakenesse, and deadlie woundes, as they sawe: but if we bende the eies of our faith to the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th of his person, and to the force and fruite of his death, as must all his saints; we shall finde the power and wisedome, iustice and mercie of God so tempered in the crosse of Christ for our good; that by his paines we are eased, by his stripes we are healed, his weakenesse is our strength, his shame is our glorie, and his death our life: worthely there|fore doth the Apostle professe, that he did, and we should not reioice but in the crosse of Christ.</P>

to fasten on him, and howsoeuer beholding the terror of Gods vengeance prouoked by our sinnes, he did somtimes <HI>tremble,</HI> yet by <HI>firme faith alwaies fixed on God,</HI> he repelled and repressed those assaults of Satan, and so saued not him|selfe onely, but vs also. This might be indured if men could stay here; &amp; it were to be wished, that in matters of so great weight and danger, we would rather try where we are, then hasten to go onward. But as water breaking her bankes still runneth and neuer stayeth; so some lighting on other mens inuentions neuer leaue adding till they marre all. In the case which we haue in hand, the name of Hell paines be|ing once admitted into the worke of our redemption, some in our daies will no nay, but that Christ on the crosse suffe|red the <HI>selfe same paines</HI> in soule, which the <HI>damned do in hell,</HI> and endured euen the <HI>death of the soule</HI>; yea others auouc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that hee sustained farre greater torments then anie are in hell, to wit, as much paine in 15. houres, as all the faithfull should haue suffered euerlastinglie, and that as well in body as in soule. To these dangerous deuises are some men slipt in our time. And because I knowe not when or where they will make an ende, I thinke it n&eacute;edfull for discharge of my dutie, and direction of your faith, as well to set downe certaine limits beyond which you may not go, as also to re|iect such extremities as by no meanes may be closed in the crosse of Christ, without apparant impietie.</P>
<P>The paines of hell (if I be not deceiued) make a fourefold impression in the soules of men;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How many im|pressions the paines of hell make in the soule of man.</HI></NOTE> a <HI>carefull feare,</HI> which decli|neth them; <HI>a doubtfull feare,</HI> which conflicteth with them; <HI>a desperate feare</HI> which sinketh vnder them, and <HI>a damned feare</HI> which suffereth them. The first is and must be in all the god|lie; and chieflie in Christ himselfe: For the more we loue God, the more wee detest and shunne all separation from God. Hell therefore which is an vtter exclusion from the kingdome of God, is most iustlie abhorred of all his saints, and speciallie of his owne Son: who not onelie by will, but by nature is one with his Father. A conflict with Hell
<PB N="10" REF="12">
if it come not from the inward motion of the mind, is but a temptation to trie the heart, or shew the strength of the god|lie. So was <HI>Adam</HI> tempted in Paradise by <HI>Eue,</HI> and <HI>Eue</HI> by the Serpent, to prooue howe mindfull they were, and thank|full they would be for the blessings of God bestowed vpon them. So was Christ tempted in the wildernesse by Sa|tan, and all his life long by the wicked, which were to him but occasions to declare the innocencie and integritie of his humane nature. But the inwarde temptation of the heart and conscience, though it bee in all the children of <HI>A|dam,</HI> (the elect themselues not excepted,) by reason of their flesh lusting agaynst the spirite, their conscience accu|sing them for sinne, and their fayth sometimes fainting; yet in Christ wee must graunt no such thing, because in him there was neither corruption of flesh, nor remorse of sinne, nor weakenesse of faith, that shoulde anie kinde of waie br&eacute;ede or yeelde to the worme, that gnaw|eth at our consciences. <HI>A desperate feare</HI> is when the wrath of God awaketh the wicked to knowe and ac|knowledge, what vengeance is prepared for them, in the life to come, and so hauing lost both fayth and hope, they fall to an horrible expectation of iudgement, and fla|ming fyre, which shall deuoure the aduersarie. But yet euen these men, whose case is most despaired, are not while they liue heere on earth, in the true paines of Hell, but are as farre from that, as expecting is from suffering. The last I knowe not howe to call, but by the name of a damned, rather paine, then feare; which the wicked departed this life doe presentlie feele. For paine that is present, inflicteth rather torment, then feare; since feare is properlie the trembling at euill, be|fore it come, and not the grieuing at it, when it is come. Of these foure impressions, yee see which I attribute vnto Christ, and which not. Despairing, or so much as doubting of his saluation, we cannot ascribe to him with|out euident impietie. And as for Christes suffering the
<PB N="11" REF="12">
same paines which the damned soules in Hell doe, to my simple vnderstanding, it is rather a dreame then a doc|trine to bee taught in the Church of Christ. Did they de|fende <HI>as great</HI> sense and anguish of paine to haue beene in Christes bodie or soule, as <HI>hell</HI> fire doth inflict to the dam|ned, though that were a verie presumptuous and audacious position, yet is it not so impious, as when they affirme he suf|red <HI>the self same</HI> which the damned do. For the damned haue many sorts of paines in hel, which by no means could fasten on Christs person; and since there be degr&eacute;es of paine in hell euen for the damned; these curious teachers must shewe vs which of these degrees Christ suffered, &amp; by what warrant of gods word, they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iunge the very paines of hell to the crosse of Christ.</P>

The <HI>causes</HI> why he must suffer them are en|larged by some into many branches, but may bee contracted into these two; <HI>THE PART</HI> that chiefly sinned in man; &amp; the <HI>VVAGES</HI> due to man for sin. The <HI>WORKE</HI> of sin appeared first &amp; most in the soul of <HI>Adam,</HI> &amp; therfore in y^e satisfaction for sin, the soul of Christ, as they say, must properly &amp; principally
<PB N="12" REF="13">
suffer. The <HI>VVAGES</HI> of sin is expressely <HI>death</HI> both of <HI>soule and bodie,</HI> and therfore Christ, as our suretie and for our sinnes, must taste of both, (as they affirm) before he can discharge vs from both. <HI>Signes</HI> that he did suffer, were his <HI>AGONIE</HI> in the garden, when he sweat blood; which for a corporall death he would neuer haue don: &amp; his <HI>COMPLAINT</HI> on the crosse, that he was forsaken of God, which (as they thinke) proouesh he felt in soule a most fearefull iudgement of God, pronoun|ced against our sinnes. To euerie of these I will speake in order, that finding the weaknesse of their foundation, we maie the sooner see the lamenesse of their conclusion.</P>
<P>To the first I might answere with Saint <HI>Austen</HI>; these words of <HI>Dauid</HI> specifie not anie suffering of hell paines on the crosse, but rather a descent to the place of hell. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Predictions that Christ should suffer y^e paines of hel. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gust. epi.</HI> 99</NOTE> <HI>That the Lord after his bodie was dead came to hell is certaine enough: for neither can the prophecie be contradicted, which said.

That this saying of <HI>Dauid</HI> doth not import anie paines suffered while Christ liued, but some honour done to his soule after his death, maie thr&eacute;e waies be prooued; by the <HI>wordes next praecedent,</HI> by the <HI>words next adioyned,</HI> and by <HI>the application</HI> which <HI>Peter</HI> maketh, when he citeth this place. The wordes next before, (which are these, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 16.</NOTE> <HI>My flesh shall rest in hope</HI>) note Christs buriall: and this is brought as a reason why Christes bodie should rest in hope, not on the crosse where it had no rest, but in the graue after he was dead; <HI>because thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell.</HI> If this respected any thing endured on the crosse, the holy ghost must haue saide in the person of Christ, because <HI>THOV HAST NOT LEFT MY SOVLE IN HEL</HI>: the paines, and
<PB N="13" REF="13">
time were both past; but he speaketh in the future tence, &amp; of future things, <HI>Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell.</HI> And this was the hope in which Christ died. Now hope neuer tendeth to things past and known, but to that which is to come. This therefore toucheth somthing consequent after Christs death, which he hoped for when he died, and not anie paines suffered on the crosse, or in the garden, whiles he liued.

But if death bee not fearefull to the seruants of Christ, as ind&eacute;ede it is not, they are the more bound to their Lord and master, who in his owne per|son to make the waie easie for them, with the losse of his life disarmed death for euer, and brake the chaines in sunder wherewith death and hell were coupled together. For Christ was the first that by seuering death from the terror and pow|er of hell, made the stroke of death contemptible to all the godlie; which otherwise was and would haue b&eacute;ene the <HI>har|binger</HI> of hell. So that when death presented it selfe to the sight of our sauiour purposing to redeeme the world, it came so fast clasped with hell; that none but the sonne of God could dissolue the band, wherewith they were linked.

<P>When the godlie complaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How the godly are forsaken.</HI></NOTE> as often they do in the scrip|tures, that they were forsaken of God, it is not onlie a plaine absurditie, but a grosse impietie to conclude of their words, that they then suffered the verie paines of the damned in hell. For example, <HI>Sion,</HI> which is the whole church of God, saith in the prophet <HI>Esay,</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Esay</HI> 49.</NOTE> <HI>the Lorde hath forsaken me:</HI> and God himselfe assureth her words to bee true, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Esay.</HI> 54</NOTE> <HI>For a while I forsooke thee, for a moment in mine anger, I hid my face from thee:</HI> Was the whole church for that time in the true paines of hell? <HI>Dauid</HI> saith of himselfe, <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psalm.</HI> 89</NOTE> <HI>Thou hast reiected and ab|horred, thou hast beene angrie with thine annointed.</HI> Was <HI>Dauid</HI> then in the verie paines of the damned? of his whole realme he saith; <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psalm.</HI> 60</NOTE> <HI>O God thou hast cast vs off, and beene angry with vs.</HI> Did all the people then suffer the torments of hell? <HI>reiecting</HI> and <HI>abhorring</HI> are wordes of greater dislike, and more detestation, then <HI>forsaking</HI>; and yet they infer not the paines of hell. Whie then doe wee so fondlie misconster the one, when we well inough vnderstande the other? why stumble we at a strawe, when we canne step ouer a blocke? To be forsaken of God as the wicked are, is to bee depriued of his fauour, grace, and spirit: and yet they are not forth|with in hell. To be forsaken, as the godlie complaine they are, is to be voide of comfort, or destitute of helpe, when their enemies assault or afflict them, which is nothing n&eacute;ere the state of the damned. For as God is said to be present by his gifts and graces: so he hideth his face, or forsaketh vs, when he refraineth his eie from watching, his eare from hearing, or his hand from helping vs in the miseries and aduersities of this life.</P>

<P>What was the true propitiatorie sacrifice which God ac|cepted for the sinnes of the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The true sacri|fice for sinne was shadowed in the figures and sacrifices of the former testament.</HI></NOTE> if the new testament did not plainelie declare, the olde testament would sufficientlie witnesse vnto vs. For as well Patriarks as Prophets, yea all the godlie from <HI>Abel</HI> to Christ did by their sacrifices and seruice of God professe and confirme their faith to be this, that they looked for the Seede of the woman, who by his death and bloud should purge their sinnes, and make peace betw&eacute;ene God and them. This was the promise of grace which God made in Paradise to our first parents, threatning the serpent with the s&eacute;ede of the woman in these words; <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Genes.</HI> 32</NOTE> <HI>He shall crush thine heade, and thou shalt bruise his heele.</HI> As the heele of man is the basest part of his bodie, and nearest the earth; so the Serpent shoulde bruise the weakest and earthliest part of Christ; but euen that bruized heele should bee of force enough to crush the Serpentes head.

brothers. This faith did all the Patriarkes testifie by their bloudie sacrifices, that they expected the bodie of the Messi|as to be bruized, and his bloud to be shed for the remission of their sinnes. And as they receiued it from their fathers, so they deliuered it to their children for the shoot anchor of all their hope. This God did ratifie by his lawe written, suffe|ring his people to haue no sacrifices for sinne, but such as represented the bloudie offering of Christ on the crosse. So that <HI>all the sacrifices</HI> and <HI>sacraments</HI> of <HI>Moses</HI> lawe were no|thing else but figures and <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hebre</HI> 9</NOTE> <HI>examples of better thinges,</HI> as the Apostle calleth them, namelie of Christes bodie once to bee offered, and his bloud once to bee shed for the abolishing of sinne. The <HI>FIGVRES</HI> of Christ before and vnder the lawe, what else doe they point, but to the death, bloud, and crosse of Christ to be the redemption and saluation of all mankinde? <HI>Abrahams</HI> readinesse to offer vp <HI>Isaac,</HI> for which the blessing was annexed to him with an othe, what doth it import but the loue of God <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 8</NOTE> <HI>Not sparing his owne sonne, but giuing him for vs all?</HI> The bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d of the passeouer sprinkled on the postes of the Israelites f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uert the destroier; doth it not represent the bloud of that immaculate lambe, which saueth vs from the fiercenesse of Gods wrath?

But which of these two was <HI>beleeued</HI> of the Patriarks, <HI>wit|nessed</HI> by the sacrifices, <HI>shadowed</HI> in the figures of the law, <HI>expected</HI> of the faithfull from the foundation of the worlde? The bloudie sacrifice of Christes bodie is so plainelie pro|claimed by them all, that there can bee no question of their faith and expectation. And were they deceiued in the obiect of their faith, and hope? Did they all mistake the true sa|crifice for their sinnes? and did God by his lawe confirme them in that errour? And doeth the Apostle falselie con|clude from the sacrifices of the lawe, that Christes offe|ring before it coulde take awaie sinne, must of force bee bloudie? These were verie strange positions in Christian religion, and yet I s&eacute;e not howe wee shall auoide them, if we strictlie maintaine the suffering of hell paines to bee the <HI>chiefer</HI> and <HI>principaller</HI> part of our redemption, without which the rest is nothing. If their faith fastened on the death and bloud of Christ for the remission of their sinnes did saue them, then was the death of Christ of force e|nough, without the paines of Hell to release them from their sinnes; and bring them vnto God. And if it wrought that effect in them, it is still of the same power and strength to worke the like in vs. If it were insufficient to re|lease them from the rigour of GODS wrath, then are the Patriarkes perished in their sinnes, by mista|king the true price of their redemption. For that they knewe anie thing of Christs suffering Hell paynes, I thinke will hardlie bee prooued. But out of question their faith was right which was settled on the bloud of Christ to bee shedde for the red&eacute;eming of their sinnes; and themselues are Saintes in Gods kingdome: Wee must therefore take heede that wee doe not rashlie varie from the foundation of their faith and hope; which must like|wise be ours, with this onelie difference, that they bel&eacute;eued in him, which should take away the sins of the worlde by his death and crosse, and we in him that hath taken them away.

<P>God might reueale, and the soule of Christ in this life be|holde, as all ours shall when we appeare before the face of God after this life, what cup was prepared for the wicked to drinke, and the <HI>sight</HI> thereof as it is <HI>most fearefull,</HI> so might it make him <HI>tremble,</HI> though he were neuer so fr&eacute;e from it; but more then the <HI>VISION</HI> of Gods wrath, and <HI>COMMISE|RATION</HI> of mans danger, if wee attribute to the soule of Christ; we must either grant he was <HI>tempted</HI> as well <HI>with our iniquities,</HI> through lacke of grace, as with our <HI>infirmi|ties</HI> through want of strength; or else cast him into a <HI>traunce</HI> at the time of his passion, as some doe, to excuse him from sinne.

The proofe I leaue to them that like the position; which if anie man affirme, he were best bee sure of his footing. It is no small arrogancie, and blas|phemie to sit Iudge in Gods place, and to <HI>condemne Christs soule to hell fire,</HI> without a sounde and cleare commission, to warrant that assertion. Besides hell fire in the Scrip|tures being <HI>ETERNALL</HI>; by what authoritie will they quench it at their pleasure, and make it temporarie? And if Christes soule beeing personallie ioyned to the Deitie, notwithstanding might feele the furie of hell fire, when shall the Saints of God, that can neuer bee so <HI>vnited</HI> vnto his glorie, nor <HI>assured of</HI> his societie, nor so endued with his sanctitie, bee free from the flames of hell? If that vnion and communion which Christ had with God, coulde not

exclude hell fire; what shall hinder but that the Angels in heauen maie for the time likewise feele the flames there|of? Can they haue <HI>faster coherence,</HI> or <HI>fuller presence</HI> of God, then hee which was ioyned with God in vnitie of per|son? They come not neere the <HI>fauour</HI> and <HI>grace, know|ledge</HI> and <HI>truth, power</HI> &amp; <HI>stedfastnes</HI> of the manhoode of Christ, which here on earth they did <HI>serue</HI> and <HI>adore.</HI> But none of these things can be intended in the Creede; for there the ar|ticles are placed in <HI>ORDER</HI> and <HI>TIME,</HI> as they were perfor|med. And therfore when Christ was <HI>DEAD AND BVRIED,</HI> he then <HI>DESCENDED INTO HELL.</HI></P>
<P>The second opinion is, that Christs descent to hell is all one with his buriall,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This opinion is not false, but impertinent and idle.</HI></NOTE> for that <HI>SHEOL</HI> in the olde testament doth most commonlie, if not continuallie signifie the graue. But this is nothing to the Creede, whose <HI>authoritie</HI> and <HI>antiquitie</HI> if wee reuerence, it is soone concluded, that hell there doth not signifie the graue. For first it is absurde, that in <HI>a short rehearsall</HI> of the faith made for the simplest to conceiue, one article shoulde bee <HI>twice repeated</HI>; and after a plaine and knowne worde, <HI>hee was buried</HI> which no man could doubt of; a darke and enigmaticall phrase of sp&eacute;ech, <HI>HE DES|CENDED INTO HELL,</HI> which fewe men did vnderstande, should bee added, rather to obscure then to expound the for|mer. Againe, <HI>HE DESCENDED,</HI> signifieth a <HI>voluntarie mo|tion,</HI> where as the bodie dead hath neither <HI>VVILL</HI> nor <HI>MO|TION.</HI> Thirdlie, <HI>HELL</HI> in the new testament, is so vnusuall for the graue; that I thinke no example can be shewed there|of. Though therefore this exposition cannot be charged with falsitie, for Christ was trulie buried; yet may it not bee en|dured by reason of the <HI>idle repetition,</HI> and <HI>strange circumlo|quution,</HI> which troubleth and confoundeth the hearer; besides the improprietie and incoherence of the worde, that a <HI>deade corps</HI> should <HI>descend,</HI> and speciallie <HI>vnto hell.</HI></P>
<P>The third opinion doth neither mistake the <HI>TIME</HI> nor the <HI>PART</HI> which descended: for they referre the words of the
<PB N="146" REF="80">
Creede to Christes <HI>SOVLE</HI> after <HI>DEATH,</HI> but they change the name of hell into the state of the deade; and so con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esse that Christes soule after separation from the bodie endured <HI>THE STATE OF THE DEAD.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The third opi|nion can hard|ly auoid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI></NOTE> To this a number of learned men incline, because they would auoyde <HI>Limbus patrum</HI>; disliking by all meanes that the soules of the righteous and faithfull before Christes suffering shoulde be kept in a region or part of hell; and thence deliuered by his descent. I see well enough what they woulde faine decline; but what if by their farre fet exposition they fall into that errour which they seeke to flie? Doe they not fairelie profer, and quite besides the marke? Let vs looke a little into their conceite. Christ <HI>descended into hell,</HI> that is, saie they, his soule after death, conuersed among the soules of the iust, that were dead before him. But where were the soules of the iust? In a place, or no? Without a place can nothing be, but onelie God. All creatures be they soules or angels are desined with place, though they doe not reple|nish their places as bodies do; yea what soeuer is <HI>not circum|scribed</HI> within a place, is <HI>infinite</HI>; which no creature can bee. The soules then of the righteous must of necesstie bee in a place. And what call you that place by your opinion? For|sooth euen <HI>HELL.</HI> For Christs descending into hell, as you expound it, was his conuersing among the soules of the dead. Those soules then were <HI>in a place,</HI> and <HI>that place</HI> by your construction the Creed calleth <HI>Hell.</HI> Their state you will say, is called hell, but not their place. A wittie difference I as|sure you. The place for soules after this life, is answerable to their state. If their state bee hell, their place can nei|ther bee Heauen, nor Paradise. As is their <HI>receptacle,</HI> so is their <HI>rest</HI>; the place doth bring either <HI>ioy</HI> or <HI>paine,</HI> which is their state. So that if Christ descending into hell conuersed with the soules of the righteous; of force the soules of the righteous were in hell, which is the selfe same errour, that you woulde seeme by your newe founde

And albeit some of these sp&eacute;e|ches may perchance admit an allegoricall sense, and so signi|fie the greatest and extreamest dangers that might be; yet the ground of the allegorie dependeth on the nature of hell, and not of the graue, because of the two sortes of pittes,

<P>The wordes then of the Cr&eacute;ede, <HI>hee descended into hell,</HI> since the defenders of this thirde opinion doe not referre to the bodie of Christ buried, but to the soule of Christ after death; it is euident by their position, that not onelie Christs soule after this life descended to hell, but all the soules of the iust and righteous leauing this worlde before Christes com|ming, descended likewise into hell. And this euasion of theirs, that <HI>Sheol</HI> in Hebrew signifieth the <HI>state of the deade</HI> after this life, be it good or bad, standeth them in little st&eacute;ed.

Quod si nusquam in diuinis authoritatibus legitur, non vtique sinus ille Abrahae, idest, secretae cuiusdam quietis habitatio ALIQVA PARS INFERORVM esse credenda est: quanquam in ijs ipsis tanti magistri verbis, vbi ait dixisse Abraham, Inter nos &amp; vos chaos magnum firmatum est; SATIS VT OPINOR APPA|RET, NON ESSE QVANDAM PARTEM, ET QVASI MEMBRVM INFERORVM, tantae illius felicitatis sinum: Chaos enim magnum, quid est nisi quidam hiatus multum ea se|parans, inter quae non solum est, verum etiam firmatus est? The name of Inferi I could no where finde in anie place of scripture vsed IN ANY GOOD SENSE: which if wee doe no where reade in the authorities of the scripture, surelie Abrahams bo|some, which is an habitation of secret rest, may not be thought to bee ANY PEECE OF THE LOVVER PARTS albeit in the words of so sufficient a maister</HI> (as our Sauiour) <HI>where he maketh Abraham say, betwixt vs and you there is a GREATE GVLFE ESTABLISHED, it is EVIDENT ENOVGH, as I take it; that the bosome of so great felicitie, is NO PART NOR MEMBER of hell. For what is a great gulfe, but a great distance separating those places, betweene which it lieth? Inferi</HI> are the lower parts where the deade remaine, which the He|brew calleth <HI>She&ocirc;l</HI>; and touching <HI>Inferi,</HI> which are the <HI>pla|ces,</HI> or <HI>spirits beneath,</HI> we maie with <HI>S.

First that <HI>Abrahams</HI> bosome is <HI>VPVVARD</HI> towards heauen, and therfore the soules of the righteous before the death of Christ
<PB N="153" REF="83">
<HI>ascended</HI> rather, then <HI>descended.</HI> Next, that neither paradise, nor <HI>Abrahams</HI> bosome, (which was the receptacle for y^e soules of all the sonnes of <HI>Abraham,</HI> that held the faith, and did the works of <HI>Abraham,</HI>) was anie part or member of hell. So that <HI>CHRISTS DESCENDING INTO HELL</HI> cannot be expounded of his conuersing with the <HI>spirites of the iust and perfect men</HI> after his death; nor of his enduring the <HI>state of the deade</HI>; since the place, where their soules doe rest after death, is no where in the scriptures called <HI>HELL</HI> or <HI>SHEOL,</HI> or, as <HI>S. Austen</HI> speaketh, <HI>INFERI.</HI> And this I take to be so cleere, that neither Iewish <HI>Rabbines</HI> with their grammati|call obseruations, nor Gr&eacute;eke <HI>poets</HI> with their fantasticall imaginations may be suffered to contradict it. Howe easie it is to wrangle with the words, <HI>NEPHESH, SHEOL,</HI> and <HI>HADES</HI> a meane scholar maie soon perceiue; but I hold it no sound course to fetch the explication of the mysteries of chri|stian religion, either from such impudent impugners of it, as were the <HI>Rabbines,</HI> or from such ignorant deluders of it, as were the prophane <HI>poets,</HI> who talke euerie where of hea|uen and hell, according to the false and lewde perswasion of their own hearts. And therfore they may spare their paines, that promise vs so manie thousand deponentes both Iewish and heathen, that <HI>Sheol</HI> and <HI>Hades</HI> do not signifie hell. It wil trouble them more then they thinke, to bring vs but one good proofe out of the scripture, that the soules of the righteous be|fore Christs comming, were in <HI>Sheol</HI> or <HI>Hades</HI>; and till they doe, I rest on <HI>Saint Austens</HI> collection out of the wordes of Christ; that <HI>Abrahams</HI> bosome is no p&eacute;ece nor part of <HI>Ha|des,</HI> or <HI>Inferi,</HI> which the hebrew calleth <HI>Sheol,</HI> as being deui|ded from it with a mightie distance; and that the soules of the iust departing this life before Christs death, were <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke.</HI> 16.</NOTE> <HI>CA|RIED VP BY THE ANGELS, INTO ABRAHAMS BO|SOME.</HI></P>

This is brieflie the victorie, that Christ obtained against sinne and death, by his dying and rising from the dead. His conquest ouer hell, as it is more questioned, and more expected, so will I not re|fuse to shew you, what I thinke maie be safelie beleeued, and must not rashlie be reiected of any christian.</P>

It remained for the full effecting of our redemp|tion, that man assumed of God without sinne, shoulde thither descend, whither man seuered from God fell by desert of sinne: that is, vnto hell, where the soule of the sinner was woont to bee tormented, and to the graue, where the flesh of the sinner was woont to bee corrupted; yet so, that neither Christes flesh shoulde bee corrupted in the graue, nor his soule bee tormented with the paines of hell; because the soule free from sinne was not to be subiected to that punishment, nor flesh cleane from the contagion of sinne shoulde suffer corruption. In so much as man sinning deserued by punish|ment to bee seuered from himselfe, who by his transgression woulde needes bee seuered from God, therefore it was appoin|ted that the death of the sinner should bring his sinfull flesh to the graue, there to rotte; and presentlie should send his soule to hell, there to be tormented. But when the sinner by the gift of (Gods) grace, was to bee deliuered; it was proui|ded, that the sonne of God should vniustlie suffer at the hands of sinners the death of the bodie, which sinfull man had iustlie beene wrapped in by the iustice of God, and the flesh of the iust should come to the graue, whither sinfull flesh was tum|bled: and that the SOVLE OF OVR SAVIOVR SHOVLD DESCEND TO HELL, VVHERE THE SINFVLL SOVL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> VVAS TORMENTED FOR THE REVVARD OF SINNE.

<P>Out of <HI>Fulgentius</HI> I obserue two things; which if it please men to marke, they shall cleare themselues from all absur|dities touching Christs descent to hell. The first is, <HI>THE PLACE, VVHITHER</HI> he desended; the next is, <HI>THE CAVSE, VVHY</HI> he descended. The <HI>place</HI> whither hee descended was <HI>hell</HI>; whither the soule of man sinning against God was adiudged for the wages of his transg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ession. The <HI>cause</HI> of his descent, was to free all the faithfull from the begin|ning of the world to the ende thereof from comming thi|ther. And in both these, the Scriptures and fathers doe ful|lie concurre; though some auncient writers doe swarue, and striue about Christes deliuering some from hell, that were there at the time of his descent, as they suppose. Which varietie and vncertaintie of opinions concerning the state of the deade before Christes comming hath verie much en|tangled this question, and induced manie men of learning and iudgement otherwise, to reiect. Christs descent to hell as a fable, or to wrest it to an other sense, with newe founde expositions. Howbeit I see no cause, but the doctrine of the Scriptures confessed by all the fathers may stande verie cleare, whatsoeuer we resolue of this other assertion, tou|ching the state of the righteous departed this life before Christs death. I will therefore shortly discusse both the place and the cause, and so draw to an end.</P>
<P>As for the place whither Christ descended, the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> gr&eacute;edily hunteth after it, to heare of her Purgatorie; hoping, whence the soules of the righteous were by Christ deliuered, there to make a stand for soules, not perfectlie con|fessed and absolued in this life; that she maie set to sale her praiers and pardons. But if shee follow Christ descen|ding,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Christ descen|ded to y^e place of the damned.</HI></NOTE> her deuotion must reach to the place and paines of the damned, for thither Christ descended.

His first ob|iection is answered in the text it selfe. For the saints did <HI>not</HI> rise <HI>before</HI> Christ, but <HI>after</HI> Christ; and so still Christ was the first borne from the dead.

In the effectes of Christes crosse I noted out of the Apostle to the <HI>Hebrues</HI> three properties of the true propitiatorie sacri|fice which tooke awaie the sinne of the world;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide page.</HI> 18</NOTE> It was a <HI>bodi|lie,</HI> a <HI>bloudie,</HI> and a <HI>deadlie</HI> sacrifice, and amongst manie reasons to confirme the same, I brought these two, which the conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter after his forgetfull maner roueth at. The first in ef|fect was this. The true sacrifice for sinne, which the Redee|mer should offer, was shadowed and foreshewed by the sa|crifices which God commanded and accepted in the old testa|ment: but the sacrifices of the Patriarches and of the faith|full appointed by <HI>Moses</HI> foreshewed and figured a bodilie, bloudie, and deadlie sacrifice, and no paines of hell; therfore the true sacrifice for sinne was made by the bodie, bloud and death of the Red&eacute;emer, and not by the paines of hell suffe|red in his soule. The second this; As the sacrifices of the law prefigured what the Sauiour of the world should do for the abolishing of sinne; so the sacraments of the newe testa|ment confirme and scale that performed in the person of Christ Iesus, which was the true propitiation for our sinnes, and price of our redemption: but the sacraments of the new testament, and speciallie the Lordes supper, declare and con|firme vnto vs the bodie of Christ giuen for vs vnto death, and his bloud shed for the remission of our sinnes; therefore this was the true propitiation for our sinnes, and price of our redemption, and not the paines of hell suffered in the soule of Christ, as some imagine. To the first the Confuter answereth; <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Page.</HI> 11.</NOTE>
<Q>The proposition is false taking it generally. The carnall sacrifices of the Iewes signified that which they were apt to signifie, but not anie further. The sacrifices of beastes coulde not prefigure the personall vnion of God and man, nor the rea|sonable and immortall soule of Christ, nor his resurrection, all which were necessarie pointes in the meritorious sacrifice. <HI>Se|condlie he denieth the assumption.</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Page. <HI>12.</HI></NOTE> For certaine of the Iewes sacrifices set foorth the sufferinges of the soule of Christ also.</Q>
As the scape Gote in the 16. of <HI>Leuiticus,</HI> which was a sin offe|ring,
<PB N="233" REF="123">
though it were sent awaie free and vntouched. To the reason drawne from the Sacraments, hee saieth, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 14.</NOTE> <HI>Wee are to answere as we did before.</HI>
<Q>These are bodilie and earthlie Ele|ments, and therefore fitte to set soorth bodilie and apparant ef|fects in Christ; they can not set out the spirituall and inuisible effects in him. And yet the ceremonie of breaking the bread, which is to shewe that Christes bodie was broken for vs, can not belong properlie to the bodie, but to the soule.</Q>
These I trust are your words; now heare my replie. I had no such proposition as you frame to your selfe, that either the sacrifices of the lawe, or Sacraments of the Gospel, were figures of our whole and absolute redemption, which is (as you expound it) of all the fruits and causes of our redemption. This is your eua|sion, not my proposition; I tolde you that as God had pro|mised, so the faithfull bel&eacute;eued, that his owne sonne should be the Seede of the woman, and by his death and bloud should purge their sinnes. To continue this promise and con|firme the faith of all before and vnder the lawe, God ap|pointed bloudie sacrifices, as continuall remembrances and figures, not of the person, nor of the function of Christ; but of the Sacrifice, by which hee shoulde abolish sinne; to wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te, by his bodie slaine, and his bloud shedde, which the carnall sacrifices were fittest to resemble, since God would not haue the bloud of anie man, but of his owne sonne shedde for remission of sinnes. My propo|sition then speaketh of the true sacrifice for sinne, and a|uoucheth that to bee the true sacrifice for sinne, which was shadowed and figured by the death and bloud of those beasts, that God comma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded to bee offered vnto him. This pro|position you doe not denie, for you graunt, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.52</NOTE> <HI>The Iewes sacrifices signified what they were apt to teach, and signifie</HI>: but they were apt and ordained of GOD to teach the Iewes, that, by the death and bloud of the Messias, they shoulde bee redeemed and saued from their sinnes; <HI>ergo</HI> they were apt and ordained of God to figure and shadowe

the true propitiatorie sacrifice. And so the patriarkes and Prophetes bel&eacute;eued and expected, whose faith and hope could neither be vaine nor frustrate, since they were thereto directed by Gods owne appointment.</P>
<P>This proposition, be you Christian or Iewe, you may not denie; and therefore you doe well to denie the assumption, and to affirme that certaine sacrifices of the Iewes, as namelie the scape Goate in the <HI>16.</HI> of <HI>Leuiticus</HI> did signi|fie the immortall soule of Christ, which was<Q> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Page.</HI> 12:</NOTE> <HI>a sacrifice for sinne, and did properlie beare our sinnes, and suffer for our sinnes.</HI></Q>But Sir, if a man aske you howe you proue that the scape Goate signified the soule of Christ, what haue you to saie? <Q><HI>Because both Goates</HI> (saie you) <HI>are a sacrifice for sinne, as the Text speaketh.</HI></Q>
You abuse the Text, and de|ceiue your selfe. The wordes are. <HI>Aaron</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Leuit.</HI> 16 <HI>vers.</HI> 5.</NOTE> <HI>shall take of the assemblie of the children of Israel two hee Goates f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r a sinne offering,</HI> that is to make a sinne offering of one of them, on which the Lordes lotte shall fall; So followe the wordes in the 8. <HI>verse</HI> of that chapter. <HI>Aaron shall cast lottes ouer the two hee Goates, one lotte for the Lorde&punc; and another lotte for the scape Goate.</HI> And <HI>Aaron shall offer the Goate on which the Lords lot shall fall, and MAKE HIM A SINNE OFFERING.</HI> The taking of the Goates from the people doth not make them sacrifices for sinne, but the of|fering them vnto the Lord by the Priest: so that though two were taken, yet lots were cast which of them should hee the sinne offering, and which of them the scape Goat, which con|sequentlie was no sinne offering, because that was made a sinne offering, on which the Lords lot fell. And so if the scape Goate did signifie the soule of Christ, as you affirme more boldlie then wiselie, then was not the soule of Christ a sinne offering, neither did it suffer for sinne, if your owne ex|ample maie bee trusted. Howbeit what the scape Goate signified, I am not so forwarde to pronounce as you bee, though I haue better warrant so to doe then you haue.

But nowe where in the number of them that come to the Lord, some belong to the Lord, some deserue to bee cast awaie, and seuered from the Lordes offering; therefore part of the sacrifice which the people bring, to wit one of the Goates, is offered to the Lorde, the other is cast off, and sent into the Desart.

But did it signifie the soule of Christ; what gaine you by that? The scape Goate was neither done to death, nor made anie sinne offering, as you falslie suppose, but was separated from the Lords offering, and let go free and vntou|ched. Then by your owne similitude the soule of Christ neither died anie death, as you after falselie and absurd|lie conclude, that the soule of Christ died, and was cru|cified; neither was it anie part of the offering for sinne to GOD, which you so much endeuour to proue. Such is
<PB N="236" REF="125">
your vnderstanding, that by your owne examples, you ouer|throw your owne positions, whiles you labour to establish them with faint conceits of your owne deuising.</P>
<P>[But in the burnt offering or holocaust prescribed, <HI>Leui.</HI> 6 you find more helpe then in the scape Goate, to proue that Christ soule suffered for our sins as wel as his body.] If you meane that Christs soule suffered the paines of hel, I would faine s&eacute;e how you proue that out of the holocaust or burnt of|fering. If you thinke the name of fire doth somewhat relieue you, remember, Sir, besides the sundrie references that fire hath in the scripture, the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Leuit.</HI> 7. <HI>ver.</HI> 2.</NOTE> holocaust was first slaine, and after burnt; and therefore vnlesse you will fasten the <HI>fire of afflictio~</HI> as you call it, to Christs body or soule after his death, the bur|ning of the dead sacrifice by fire will little further your pur|pose. Again, in one and the same fire was the holocaust con|sumed. If this therefore touch the death and passion of Christ, his bodie and soule must iointly suffer one and the same kind of affliction; which is the thing you so much impugne. And since by your owne position the bodies of beasts <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> 11</NOTE> <HI>could not "prefigure the immortall and reasonable soule of Christ,</HI> how com|meth it now to passe that y^e body of the holocaust after death shall signifie as well the soule as the bodie of Christ? Can you thus plant and plucke vp with a touch? It is no waie denied or doubted by mee, that the soule of Christ was af|flicted and tormented with sorrow and paine all the time of his passion; which this Trister so much laboureth to proue; and therefore if the holocaust did signifie the whole manhood of Christ suffering for our sinnes, it could not preiudice anie thing, that I did or doe teach, as anon thou shalt (gentle Reader) more plainlie perceiue; but yet whie the burning of the holocaust should signifie Christes affliction on the Crosse, either in bodie or soule, I see no proofe made by this Confuter; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd why it should not resemble Christes af|flictions before death, these two reasons mooue me. First it was burnt after it was dead; next it was wholie consumed
<PB N="237" REF="125">
by fire; neither of which can accord with Christes sufferings or the crosse: but by the burning of that sacrifice, I take ra|ther the <HI>acceptation</HI> of Christs death, or his <HI>incorruption</HI> af|ter death to be signified. For that part of each sacrifice which God reserued for himselfe, and receiued to himselfe, was al|wayes burnt with fyre; and the Hebrue word, <HI>HOLAH,</HI> which the Scripture vseth for the holocaust, signifieth <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 8. <HI>Exod.</HI> 29. <HI>Leuit.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>that which ascendeth vp to God (by fire;)</HI> whence God is often saide in the scriptures, when hee accepteth an holocaust, to smel a sw&eacute;ete sauour. Which words saint <HI>Paul</HI> applieth to the death of Christ in saying, <HI>Christ gaue himselfe for vs to be a sacrifice vnto God of a sweet smelling sauour,</HI> that is well pleasing and acceptable vnto God. So likewise because the fire consu|med in the holocaust all that was subiect to corruption, the holocaust may signifie Christs incorruption after death. This sense S. <HI>Austen</HI> approoueth, when he saith. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>August. in. psal.</HI> 50.</NOTE> <HI>Sic leuetur holocau|stum vt absorbeatur mors in victoriam; Let the holocaust so as|cend that death bee swallowed vp in victorie.</HI> And againe, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>August. in psal.</HI> 65.</NOTE><HI>Quando totum consumitur igne diuino, holocaustum dicitur.

No man euer burned with this fire comparable to Christ Iesus; whose loue towardes God and man flamed, as vnto death, so after death, most feruentlie.

<P>In the power of Christs death to proue the bloud of our sa|uiour to be the true price of our redemption, and that as wel of our soules as of our bodies; I alledged the words of <HI>Peter</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>You were redeemed with the precious bloud of Christ</HI>; and of the souls in heauen saying vnto Christ, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Reuel.</HI> 5.</NOTE> <HI>Thou wast killed, &amp; hast redeemed vs to God by thy bloud</HI>; when their bodies were rotten in y^e earth. Hence I reasoned, if our soules be not re|deemed fro~ death by the blood of christ, our bodies haue in this life no benefite of redemption, I meane from death; for wee die as doe infidels, and our bodies rot in the graue as theirs doe till the daie of resurrection. But S. <HI>Peter</HI> saieth, <HI>wee are</HI> redeemed, not we shall bee; and the saints say to Christ when their bodies lie in the dust, <HI>Thou hast redeemed vs by thy bloud; ergo</HI> that redemption which we haue in this life, must be referred to our soules; and our bodies must expect the ge|nerall daie of redemption in the ende of the world.

<Q><HI>What a paradox, yea what impietie is this? Haue our bodies no good at all by Christes death,

And therefore if our Soules be not redeemed by the blood of Christ from Sinne &amp; death, we haue presentlie no redempti|on by the bloud of Christ, but must staie for the time of our resurrection before we shall haue it. Which is contrarie to the words both of Peter and of the Soules in heauen, that saie to Christ when their bodies bee rotten in earth, <HI>Thou hast re|deemed vs by thy blood.</HI> Here y^u tell vs of the iustification, mortification, and sanctification of our bodies, as also of the expectation of glorie, which our bodies shall haue, and thinke to make a great conquest of the words, <HI>NO GOOD AT ALL</HI>; but pull in your hornes. Besides that my meaning is verie plaine, whatsoeuer the wordes were, which I might vse, which I do not acknowledge to be these that you bring, but that our bodies haue no benefitte of Redemption from death; marke well the condition annexed to the proposition, <HI>If our soules bee not redeemed by the death and bloud of Christ</HI>; and then all these absurdities which you thought to fasten on mee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all full on your owne head.

Haue our bodies these things of themselues, or from our soules first iustified, mortified; sanctified and as|sured of life?

<P>In proposing the question, and pursuing the proofes; there is some hope (christian Reader) the holines of the confuters cause wil lead him to go plainly &amp; sou~dlie to work. Thus ther|fore he beginneth.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 1.</NOTE> 
<Q><HI>The whole controuersy hath in it two points.</HI><LIST>

</LIST>
Now then for the former, thus we saie and constantly auow: Christ Iesus did suffer in his whole manhoode for the redemption and sa|tisfaction of our sinnes: yea he suffered properly and immediatelie in his soule and not in his flesh only. Therefore he suffered for vs the wrath of God. This consequent is manifest and cannot be de|nied. The antecedent or first part of the former generall reason is denied and confidentlie reiected yet how falselie by Gods helpe shal
<PB N="243" REF="128">
easily appeare.</Q>
Touching the first part of this controuersie; were you awaked or a sl&eacute;epe (Sir refuter) when I preached of these thinges, that you so constantlie auowe this was the question, whether Christ suffered for vs th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wrath of God or no? if you were present and not a sleepe, it is too much bold|nes to outface the world in print, that this was the position which I impugned. There were too manie witnesses there, for mee to denie, or you to belie, the question; you knowe it well enough, but you cannot tell how to proue that which I then reproued, and therefore you shrink from that, and dallie with generall and doubtfull termes, which according as they are expounded, may either make with you, or against you. The question proposed by me, was, <HI>whether it could be pro|ued by the scriptures, or by necessary consequent from them, that Christ in his soule suffered the true paines of hell such as the damned doe suffer, and wee shoulde haue suffered, had we not beene redeemed by him</HI>? I added, if we tooke the paines of hell metaphoricallie for great and extreame sorrowes and paines, as <HI>Dauid</HI> and <HI>Ionas</HI> did, she speach might be to|lerated; but if wee tooke them properlie for the verie same which the damned doe and shall suffer in hell, as there is no proofe for it, so there is no truth in it. To this you saie no|thing, and so to all wise men make a confession that you cannot iustifie that, which I then disallowed. Ye bee come since to tell vs that certainelie Christ suffered the wrath of God for vs; which if it be granted you, I doe not see what it canne helpe your cause, or hurt mine. For the wrath of God extendeth to all paines and punishmentes as well cor|porall as spirituall, in this life and the next, be they tem|porall or eternall. So that no paine or punishment small or great coulde befall the bodie or soule of Christ, but it must n&eacute;edes proc&eacute;ed from the wrath of God. Wherefore your idle discourse of 32. leaues, in which you labor to proue that Christ suffered the wrath of God for sinne, might wel haue bin spa|red. Thr&eacute;e lines directlie to the purpose had bin more worth
<PB N="244" REF="129">
then so many leaues thus wastfullie spent.
But in the ende you conclude like a Clark, Christ suffered the wrath of God, <Q><NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 33.</NOTE> <HI>which we affirme is equall to hell it selfe, and all the tormentes thereof.</HI></Q>
What you affirme I little regarde; what you can proue is that I intend. And out of this proposition Christ suf|fered for vs the wrath of God for sinne, you shall neuer con|clude; <HI>Ergo</HI> hee suffered the true paines of hel. Were your proposition generall shal Christ suffered all the wrath of God for sinne, that is the whole wrath of God and euery part thereof due to sinne, you might well conclude; <HI>Ergo</HI> he suffe|red the true paines of hell; for hell ind&eacute;ede as it is the last, so is it the greatest effect of Gods wrath against sin; but from an indefinite proposition as yours is, which maie signifie the <HI>VVHOLE</HI> or <HI>SOME PART</HI> of <HI>GODS VVRATH</HI> due to sinne, you shall neuer inferre what part you list, as here you doe.</P>
<P>Will you, to make your consequent good, amend your an|tecedent and make it generall; that Christ suffered the whole wrath of God, &amp; euery part thereof due to sinne? Then heare good Sir, mine answere. That proposition, besides that it no waie followeth vpon your first antecede~t; Christ suffered properlie and immediatlie in his soule, therefore he suffered the whole wrath of God and euery part thereof due to sinne: besides I saie that there is no coherence, no consequence be|twixt these two propositions; the later of them, that Christ suffered the whole wrath of God due to sinne, and euery part thereof, is most <HI>impious</HI> and <HI>blasphemous.</HI> For so neither <HI>vtter desperation,</HI> nor <HI>finall reiection,</HI> nor <HI>eternal damnation</HI> are ex|cepted, but Christ did and must suffer them all; since they are partes, yea the chiefest partes and effectes of Gods wrath against sinne. This is far from your meaning, as you often protest. Trulie I bel&eacute;eue it; charitie leades me to thinke, though you be somewhat foolish in this cause, that yet you are not so diuelish as to fasten these things on the sonne of God. But you must also be so wise as to s&eacute;e, that if your antecedent
<PB N="245" REF="129">
be general these wil follow, whether you mean them or no: if your antecedent be not general, but indefinite, as, Christ suf|fered the wrath of God due to sinne, that is some partes and effectes of Gods wrath due to sinne, you shall neuer make choise in your conclusion which parts he suffered, as namelie the true paines of hel &amp; of the damned. Now choose which you will, either the inualiditie of your argument, or the impietie of your antecedent; the one will proue you to lack learning, that you s&eacute;e not the difference; the other that you want chri|stianity, if you should not with mouth disclaim, and with hart detest that horrible blasphemie.</P>
<P>You wil pretend I know, your conclusion is not general: no more indeed is it; your words are, <Q><HI>therfore Christ suffered for vs the wrath of God</HI>;</Q>but this conclusion beeing indefinite, and verie doubtfull, will do you no good in the fortifieng of your cause.
For Christ may suffer the wrath of God in his bodie, yea in his soule hee maie suffer it, and yet not the paines of the damned, or of hell: but because you make this the maine foundation of your whole matter, let vs looke somewhat better into it. You labour to proue by a long pro|cesse that Christ suffered the wrath of God for sinne. First then what meane you by the wrath of God? I hope you doe not meane anie inwarde affection or perturbation in God, but as you expo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nde your selfe <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 37.</NOTE> <HI>the verie effectes of his iust wrath</HI>; you shoulde saie, of his iustice and power punishing" sinne.

Nowe what particu|lar punishmentes God hath prouided for sinne as well in this life, as the next, to chastise and reuenge both the bo|dies and soules of sinners, woulde aske long time to re|hearse. The greatest and foarest are these iudgementes, which are executed on the wicked, in the worlde to come; to witte, reiection from the kingdome of God, and condem|nation to hell fire, where not onelie darkenesse amazeth the eies, and remembrance of sinne committed afflicteth the conscience, but an intolerable flame of fire tormenteth both soule and bodie for euer. These terrible iudgementes of GOD against sinne the Scriptures publish and de|nounce to men in this life, that if the loue of heauen doe not winne them to obedience, the feare of hell shoulde hold them from resisting and contemning God. The greatest torment that in this life canne befall a sinner is desperati|on; when the soule of man, conuinced in her selfe by the number of her hainous ofsences, loseth all hope of life to come, and casteth her eies wholie on the fearefull tormentes of hell prepared for her; the continuall thought and fright whereof doe so amaze and afflict the comfortlesse soule, that shee sinking vnder the burden feeleth in her selfe the horrour of hell before shee come to it. So that the losse of heauen, and feare of hell maie torment wicked and desperate persons in this life; but the execution thereof,
<PB N="247" REF="130">
after this life, shall breede an other manner of astonishment and torment, then they canne yet conceaue. If the thought of these iudgementes and punishmentes, ordayned by Gods power and iustice for sinners, so afflict men, what shall the sight doe? If the feare of hell bee so intolerable, what shall the flame bee? when therefore you saie (Sir Re|futer) Christ suffered for vs <HI>the wrath of God</HI>; wee must not content our selues with that generall worde, you must tell vs in particular what partes and effectes of GODS wrath Christ endured, before you canne auouch that which hee suffered, to bee equall to hell and all the tormentes thereof. Did hee suffer hell fire either in soule, or in bodie? the damned shall suffer it in both. Did hee finde or feare himselfe to be excluded from the kingdome of God? the dam|ned doe see themselues shut out for euer. If hee neither felt nor feared the <HI>MYST,</HI> the <HI>VVORME,</HI> the <HI>FIRE</HI> of hell, nor so much as <HI>DOVBTED</HI> the <HI>LOSSE</HI> of Gods kingdome, what tormentes equall to hell canne you name vs? [The wrath of God you will saie, is equall to hell and all the tor|ments thereof]. The wrath of God is hell, and so are all the tormentes of hell; yea they are the sharpest effectes of Gods wrath against sinne. And therefore neuer plaie with gene|ralities and ambiguities, but expresse plainly what other ef|fectes of Gods wrath you meane. For since the <HI>losse</HI> of hea|uen, the <HI>darkenesse, worme,</HI> and <HI>fire</HI> of hell, and the <HI>feare</HI> of both bee the greatest and sorest iudgementes of God a|gainst sinne, that are <HI>decreed</HI> by his <HI>iustice, reuealed</HI> by his <HI>word,</HI> and <HI>executed</HI> by his <HI>power,</HI> in this life or the nexte: wee plainelie and truelie saie you can name vs none other effectes of Gods wrath equall to these.
If then it be hay|nous impietie to saie, Christ suffered these, and none other are equall to these, take backe your lauishing vntruth, that Christ suffered the effects of Gods wrath, <Q><HI>equal to hel and all the tormentes thereof</HI>; </Q>for my part I see neither sense nor rea|son in it.</P>

This Antecedent as you vtter it, (your meaning is secret to your selfe) doth neither good nor hurt to the Question.

And when I gaue sixe causes that might bee of Christs agonie in y^e garden, did I so much as pretend that anie of them then touched his bodie, when he was affected with this passion of mind?

<HI>How prooue you your first proposition,</HI><Q> In which part <HI>Adam</HI> did first Sinne, by that part Christ must satisfy for sinne?</Q>
Satisfaction for Sinne the Scripture acknowledgeth none but by death; because y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Iudge in prohibiting <HI>Adam</HI> to trans|gresse threatned death:<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gene.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>In the day that thou eatest therof thou shalt die the death</HI>: and the Apostle saith plainlie; <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hebrue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 9.</NOTE> <HI>Christ is the mediator of the new testament, that THROVGH DEATH, which was for the REDEMPTION of the transgressions in the former Testament, they which were called might receiue the promise of eternall inheritance.</HI> If nothing might satisfie for sinne but death; then consequently the Soule of Christ which could not die, could not paie the satisfaction for our Sinnes, howsoeuer Adam did, and we still doe sinne, most properlie with our Soules. This is but a straw in your waie; for you stiflie, but absurdly, if not impiously defend, that Christ died the death of the Soule;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide page</HI> 79.</NOTE> yet because the Scriptures and Fa|thers with one consent auouch the contrarie, yea S. Austen is so peremptorie therein that he asketh, <HI>QVIS AVDEAT DICERE, VVHO DARE AFFIRME IT?</HI> you shall giue mee leaue to tell you that the Apostle denieth your <HI>Maior,</HI> till you can make it good, not by your own vnlearned frensie, but by good testimonie of Scripture, that Christ did die the death of the Soule.
Now by your assumption, that Adam <Q><HI>most proper|lie committed sinne in his soule</HI>; </Q>If you mean that Adams soule was the agent, his body the Instrument which the soule vsed as in all sins, so in this; that ind&eacute;ed is most true, but directly repugnant to your conclusion.
Put that for your <HI>Minor,</HI> that
<PB N="254" REF="134">
<HI>Adams soule transgressed the commaundement with hir bodie and by hir bodie</HI>; the conclusion then followeth in spite of your hart; <HI>ergo</HI> in satisfying for sinne the Soule of Christ must be punished with hir bodie &amp; by hir bodie; which is the thing you labour to ouerthrowe with all the wits you haue. Meane you otherwise that <HI>Adam</HI> brake the Commaunde|ment of God, not by his bodie properlie, but by his soule? Then is your assumption a manifest contradiction to the fact of <HI>Adam.</HI> For with his eares he heard the perswasion of the woman, with his eies he liked the forbidden fruit, with his hand he tooke it, with his mouth he did eat it, which was the fact that God preciselie did prohibit. God did not saie to <HI>A|dam</HI> thou shalt not <HI>like</HI> it, or <HI>desire</HI> it, which the soule of <HI>Adam</HI> did, but <HI>THOV SHALT NOT EATE THEREOF,</HI> which could not bee performed but by the hand and mouth of <HI>A|dam:</HI> and therefore <HI>Adam</HI> transgressed the commandement not by his soule, but by his bodie, euen as in murder, theft, &amp; adulterie, these facts men commit by their bodies and not by their soules.</P>
<P>[But in that and all other sinnes brought to effect, the soule, you will saie, is the principall agent, the bodie is but the Instrument.] I grant it willinglie; and thence I conclude, <HI>ergo</HI> in the satisfaction for sinne, the soule must be the principall patient and dolent, and the bodie by Gods iustice must be the instrument of her paine. And here marke I praie th&eacute;e (Christian Reader) whether this one ar|gument doe not vtterlie ouerthrow all that this idle discour|ser hath doone, and would doe in this whole pamphlet. For nothing is more proportionable to Gods iustice, then to ioine them in paine, that were ioyned in sinne; and to re|taine the same order in punishing, which they kept in offen|ding. But all prouocations and pleasures of sinnes the soule <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aketh from her bodie, all acts of sinne she committeth by her bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e: therefore the iustice of God both temporallie and
<PB N="255" REF="134">
eternallie punisheth the soule by the bodie; that as it hath beene the Instrument of her pleasure, so it shall bee of her paine.
And if GOD obserue this course as well in his temporall as eternall vengeance on the sinnes of men, whie then shoulde not the sufferinges of Christes soule by his bodie bee truelie and properlie a satisfaction for sinne, which this great Doctor a little before said,<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 18.</NOTE> <HI>made not properlie to our Redemption?</HI></Q></P>

and doe you nowe for an aduantage vrge that the ene|mie must haue a price for his captiue? Secondlie the price that wee shoulde haue paide was eternall condemnation of bodie and soule into hell fire.

If you aske to learne, you may bee soone taught. If you aske to brag, you maie be soone cooled. The curse of God vpon the sinne of man proceedeth from the wrath of God against the sinne of man; howbeit God curseth not onelie sinners, but other his creatures, with whom he is not angrie, but only because they shoulde not serue the pride and lustes of the wicked.

Gods spirituall curse, by which he depriueth the wicked of his <HI>trueth,</HI> of his <HI>grace</HI> and other <HI>giftes</HI> of his spirite, you must likewise cleare the sonne of GOD from. Hee cannot be subiected to that parte of Gods curse without apparant impietie. Take from him trueth, you make him a lyar; take from him grace you charge him with a reprobate minde; take from him the Spirit of GOD, you giue place to Satan to worke in him as in the children of vnbeliefe. I trust (Sir Refuter) you bee neither so wicked as to thinke, neither so desperate as to defend, that the sonne of God might suffer any of these curses.

Are you so well ac|quainted with <HI>Saint Paules</HI> minde, that of your owne heade, to vphold your humorous fansie, you will vrge his meaning without his wordes, to support a manifest falsitie?

But that I thinke (Sir Refuter,) you sinne of ignorance, not meaning to maintaine these blasphemies, and yet including them within the largenesse of your words, through the weaknesse of your wit, I must by the duty which I owe to God, and his truth, haue giuen you other termes, then now I do; but I had rather fatherly warne you to take

<P>I hope, though I vaunt not, as he doth, there can bee no doubt, but the curse of God for sinne containeth these partes which I propose; to wit, the <HI>externall, corporall, spirituall,</HI> &amp; <HI>eter|nall plagues</HI> and punishments, wherewith God pursueth the wicked that rebell against him.

With these impieties and blasphemies, I trust no Christian will burthen the soule of our Sauiour; and yet these are the true spirituall curses of God against sinne.

receauing a <HI>Iudiciall,</HI> and <HI>corporall</HI> punishment of death for our sinne, not onlie therein <HI>suffered</HI> the curse, but <HI>satisfied</HI> the force of the law, &amp; by that curse of his suffering red&eacute;emed vs from the curse of our transgressing. The place cited out of <HI>Moses</HI> is this; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deuter.</HI> 21</NOTE> <HI>if a man haue committed an offence worthy of death, and is</HI> (by the lawe) <HI>to die, and thou hang him on a tree: his body shall not remaine all night on the tree, but thou shalt bury him the same day; for the curse of God is</HI> (alreadie laid or executed) <HI>on him that is hanged.</HI> This most apparantly was a <HI>publike</HI> punishment <HI>executed</HI> by the <HI>magistrate</HI> vpon the <HI>body</HI> of the offender; and because by his open and shamefull death, which <HI>Moses</HI> rightlie calleth <HI>the curse of God,</HI> hee had <HI>satisfied</HI> the sentence of the Iudiciall lawe, God commandeth no far|ther reproch to be offered his bodie, in suffering it to hang in all mens eies any longer, but to bee buried the same daie; For that <HI>by</HI> his <HI>death</HI> the <HI>curse</HI> of God <HI>ceased.</HI> The difference betw&eacute;ene these two curses is soone perceiued. Euerie sinne receaued the first curse, whereof <HI>Paul</HI> spake before; fewe crimes receaued the iudgement of this seconde kinde of curse which was to bee hanged. The first was inflicted by God himselfe: the second was executed by the magistrate. The first touched bodie and soule, in this life and the next; the second ended with the death of the bodie. The first was committing of sinne, the seconde was suffering for sinne. And therefore <HI>Chrysostomes</HI> exposition is verie true, when hee saieth; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chrysost. in ca.</HI> 3. <HI>ad Galat.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The people were obnoxious to another curse,</HI> which was this; <HI>Cursed is euerie one, that continueth not in that which is written in the booke of the lawe, for there was not one of them that had fulfilled the whole Lawe; but Christ in|steede of that, tooke vpon him another curse, which said, cursed is euery one that hangeth on the tree.

<P><Q>[Before a man can be accursed by his death, hee must, you saie, be iustlie hanged; for manie <HI>Innocents and martyrs are hanged who are most blessed.</HI>] </Q>Innocentes and martyrs, bee their soules neuer so blessed, maie beare in their bodies a shamefull death, as Christ did in his&punc; and that is a kinde of corporall curse, though by men vniustlie inflicted, e|uen as death in the godlie is a remnant of Gods curse vp|on sinne, though their soules bee blessed before and after death.
Yea the worde <HI>KALAL</HI> whence the Hebrewes de|riue that which with them signifieth a curse, noteth also to <HI>make vilde and contemptible,</HI> as if shame, reproch, and contempt were the greatest outwarde curse, that coulde befall anie man in this life. The cause why wee suffer it, shall make it iust or vniust; but wee must call thinges by those names, which GOD first allotted them. Nowe death, shame, wrong, reproch, and such like, God orday|ned at first to bee punishmentes of sinne, and so partes of the curse due to sinne. If wee suffer at mens handes for piety, that which God appointed to be the wages of iniquity, so wee bee patient and willing to abide the triall, which is righteous with God, though iniurious from men, the name is not altered, but the reward increased. Yea God it is, that causeth iudgement to beginne at his own house oftentimes, by the handes of persecutors; hee doth vs right, when men doe vs wrong; and dealeth not with vs according to our sinnes in the greatest wrongs that can be done vs. Therfore martyrs and innocents may do well to remember, that God hath cause enough, though man haue none; and so submit themselues as worthie of worse from Gods handes. But none of these thinges may be saide of our Sauiour, who a|lone among all the children of men wanted sinne, and suf|fered wrong; and therefore his punishments with God were

<HI>iust, not</HI> by his <HI>deseruing,</HI> but by his <HI>desiring</HI> to suffer for man.

You mistake, Sir Confuter, as well the <HI>sentence of</HI> the lawe, as the <HI>suertiship</HI> of Christ.

Remorse of sinne committed, vexing and gnawing the conscience, is the first of their paines, which suffereth them night nor daie to take anie test. Secondlie, the feare that God, whome they haue despised, hath likewise reiected them and is become their enemie, and therefore from him they looke for nothing, but the iust vengeance of their sinnes both in this life and the nexte, so pursueth them, that they tremble and slie when no man followeth them. Thirdlie the griefe to forsee themselues excluded from the fellowship of that ioie and blisse, which is prouided for the saintes of GOD, which <HI>Chrysostom</HI> saieth is far <HI>more bitter</HI> then the <HI>paine of hel,</HI> doth make them sinke for sorrowe. Lastlie the continuall terrour of that dreadfull iudgement which shall be pronounced, of that horrible confusion which then shall o|uerwhelme them; and of those eternall and intollerable flames of fire in which they shall burne; the verie terrour I saie and horrour thereof doeth so afflict and torment them, as if they presentlie felt it. More wordes may bee vsed, and perhaps more vehement to amplifie their paine; but these are the partes and causes of that feare and horrour, which pursueth the wicked for their haynous offences. Can anie of these, (Sir Refuter,) bee applied to Christ? Dare you but offer so much as the mention of the least of them to bee founde in the sonne of GOD? I thinke you bare not; I hope you will not.

The horrour and paine, which the Reprobate heere feele, riseth from the remorse of their owne conscience, and from the distrust and feare of their owne hearts; which pursueth them euen in this life before iudge|ment. The execution of his terrible vengeance ind&eacute;ede God hath reserued to the next life.

And therefore if I conceaue anie thing, you misse the truth verie much, Sir Confuter, when you saie that Christ was touched in horrour and paine as d&eacute;epelie as the Reprobates are; and yet your conceite reacheth farther.

But Sir, how proue you this you saie? as in feares and sorrowes there bee di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers degr&eacute;es; so are there likewise in astonishme~ts. To be astonished is to ioine feare with admiration, which draweth the minde so wholie to think on some speciall thing aboue our reach, that during the time we turne not our selues to anie other cogitation. Euen as the eie, if it be bent intentiuelie to behold anie thing, for that present it discerneth nothing else: So fareth it with y^e soule, if she wholie addict her selfe to thinke on anie matter, she is a|mused; if it bee more then she conceaueth, or more fearefull then she well indureth, she is amazed, or astonished; but not of necessitie so, that she looseth either sense or memorie; one|lie for that time she conuerteth neither to anie other obiect. The present beholding of the diuine maiestie sitting in iudgement; and of his iustice armed with infinite power to reuenge the sinnes of men, might iustlie astonish the hu|mane soule of Christ; seeing the rewithal how mightilie God was prouoked by the manifold and wilfull transgressions of men; but this religious astonishment, though it might for a season suspend all other thoughtes in our Sauiour, yet is there no neede it shoulde depriue him of vnderstanding, sense or memorie.

Sir Refuter, if your vnderstanding and memorie be not lost, I tolde you that the humane nature of Christ pre|sented it selfe before the maiestie of God in iudgement, there to suffer man euerlastinglie to perish, whome hee deerelie loued, or to vndertake in his owne person that burthen, which the iustice of God, displeased with our sinnes, should laie vpon him. And if you doe not thinke this a cause sufficient for the manhoode of Christ to feare and tremble, yea for the time to bee astonished at the number of our sinnes, and terrour of Gods vengeance, prouided for our eternall destruction both of bodie and soule, you bee so d&eacute;epe in your hellish paines, that your wits and senses are con|founded.

is sinne.

So that when you make Christ to triple his praiers with vehement teares and cries, &amp; still repugnant to the will of God, you chalenge the sonne of God with open sinne, from which you would seeme to excuse him. And as for your double relapse into the same astonish|ment still, when Christ was twice cl&eacute;ere from it, it is a foolish deuice of your idle braines, as if the Lorde no sooner retur|ned to his praiers, but your hellish confusion did waite at his heeles, to interrupt and ouerwhelm him; and within sixe wordes againe to leaue him. If your cause be holie, iest not thus prophanelie with the sonne of God, nor bereaue him of his wits, when you thinke good. If it were a ne|cessarie effect of Gods wrath, then after it lighted on our Sauiour in the garden, it must continue till man was re|d&eacute;emed, and Gods wrath appeased, which was not done but by the death of Christ. And therefore make your choise: ei|ther let the wrath of God cease in the garden, when Christ ended his praiers; or if that still continued to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he death, let also this astonishment still continue, or at least bee no ne|cessarie effect of Gods wrath.

<P>[I doe you wrong, you will saie, to call your opinion the tower of Confusion;] you do your selfe wrong (Sir Re|futer) in the chiefest point of Christian religion to leaue the faith confessed by the whole Church of Christ for these 1500. yeares, and to walke in such ambiguities, and ab|surdities as your selfe doe not vnderstande.

that the reprobate and desperate, feeling the sense of GODS wrath vpon them, doe not loose their wits, and senses as Christ by your assertion did?
will you affirme they are astonished and all confounded as Christ was? then if you excuse Christ from sinne, in dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iking and declining his Fathers knowne will, because hee was astonished; you must likewise excuse all the wicked and Reprobate from their sinnes, after they once feele the sense of Gods wrath, because they cannot but bee astonished and con|founded vnder that burden?

<Q>[<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Page <HI>.57.</HI></NOTE> If a man in distresse fall a sleepe, <HI>saie you,</HI> or be astonished with some violent blowe on the heade, in such an one there is no decaie of faith, nor of obedience, nor of patience, nor of loue; euen so in Christ there was no defect of grace, but an infirmitie of nature.] </Q><HI>Was Christ a sl&eacute;epe or in a swoune? astonished you thinke, he was.</HI>
Was hee so astonished that his senses were taken from him? did hee not walke? did he not speake? did hee not pray? whie then compare you this to a sl&eacute;ep or a swoune; wheras in Christ was neither? and though you plainelie faile in your comparison; yet, were it so, as you would haue it, for your life you cannot auoide my conclusion. For a man in a sleepe or a swoune, though he loose not the habite of faith and pati|ence, obedience and loue, yet hath hee no vse of them for that time; much lesse doth hee serue God with them. But Christ <HI>Iesus by all his sufferinges must merite,</HI> which a

man a sleepe or amazed cannot doe, And therefore remem|ber, (Sir Refuter) this reason amongst the rest is yet vn|answerd; and I thinke wil somwhat trouble your braines before it bee answered. <HI>All that Christ suffered for our Re|demption was, and must bee, meritorious with God. But the suffering of hell paynes, which astonish and confounde all the powers of the soule, and senses of the bodie, neither was, nor coulde bee meritorious with God; Christ therefore did not suffer such hellish paynes as did confounde and astonish all the powers of his soule and senses of his bodie.</HI> And thus, by your amazed position, you haue wholie confounded your owne opinion.</P>
<P>Thou hast heard (good Reader) a number of the Refu|ters speciall follies; I haue some fewe more to trouble thee with, and so I will leaue him to his holie cause, and thee to the mercies of God. To shewe himselfe learned as well in the Gr&eacute;eke tongue, as in philosophie, hee vndertaketh an o|ther reason that I made, and sporteth himselfe somewhat handsomlie with it. Out of the fift to the Hebrewes where the Apostle saieth, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hebre.</HI> 5</NOTE> <HI>Christ in the daies of his flesh did offer vp prayers and supplications with strong cryes and teares vnto him that was able to saue him from death, and was heard in that he feared,</HI> or deliuered from his feare; I collected two things. First that Christ in his praiers made in y^e garden (for to those the Apostle pointeth) did but feare, and not as then suffer that he feared. The nexte, he was deliuered from his feare; and consequentlie neuer came to suffer that from which hee was deliuered. This Confuter replieth, as hee thinketh, verie soundlie, and verie sufficientlie. Thou shalt heare the whole. My reason hee maketh to bee this. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 74.</NOTE>
<Q>That wherein Christ was hearde and deliuered from by praier, he feared but felt not. But Christ was heard and deliuered by prayer from the wrath which he feared, therefore he felt it not. <HI>His answere is.</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> Nay euen therefore he felt it. Wee deny therefore the first proposition. For hee was in some sense of it, when hee praied against it, and was

heard. He had then some foretast but the extremity came after, which hee before feared. And finallie hee being in all this was heard (as the verie word (<GAP DESC="foreign">) seemeth to im|port) and delyuered from it, that is at least, not before hee had felt it. Againe very the fearing of Gods wrath is a true feeling, I saie not a ful feeling, but a true feeling: but it is gran|ted that now in this Agonie hee feared the wrath of God: Therefore hee truelie felt it. Therefore the Question is gran|ted.</Q>
You wrote this in the morning, Sir Refuter, when you were fresh and fasting, it is so short and sharpe; but be like it was darke, or your eies were dull you could not s&eacute;e neither what I said, nor what your selfe saie.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Pag.</HI> 29.</NOTE> The force of my reason consisted in this, that where feare goeth before suffering, and is no longer called feare when suffering com|meth; if Christ at the time of his praiers in the garden were deliuered from his feare, much more from anie suffe|ring of that hee feared. And since by your owne positions you affirme hee feared in his agonie the paines of hell; I concluded hee suffered them not. Let vs now s&eacute;e howe you impugne this reason. You first change suffering into s&eacute;e|ling, and because the soule in all hir affections hath a kind of feeling, you inferre, <HI>naie therefore Christ felt it.</HI> Your manner is too shrowde your selfe with generall and am|biguous words that maie signifie anie thing, and then you shew your learning in speaking you knowe not what. But vse the word suffering which I did, or take feeling for suffe|ring, in which sence it maie stand; and then s&eacute;e how absurd|lie and falslie you take my reason at this rebound. For then you must saie. <HI>Fearing is a kind of feeling, Christ fea|red the paines of hell,</HI> ergo <HI>Christ suffered them</HI>; and so by your logicke whosoeuer feareth captiuitie or death, is a captiue, and dead; and hee that feareth to loose his purse, hath lost it; yea hee that feareth to offend God, doth offend him; and hee that feareth to bee an hereticke, is an here|ticke.

Now is a man deliuered from his feare by suffering that he feared? So wee iest with men, when we will giue them their deserts, and let them stand no longer in suspence; but God so iested not with his sonne, as to rid him from his feare, by present punishment. God there|fore heard Christs prayer and deliuered him from his feare, when as yet he did not suffer it; and being deliuered from it in the garden, how came he to suffer it more extremely on the Crosse?

<PB N="303" REF="159">
Christ to be deliuered, from that he feared, was (by your con|struction) to suffer the extremitie of that he feared.

[H&eacute;e was deliuered you will say, from the continuance of it?] No (good Syr) Christ neuer feared the paines of hell should con|tinue on him after death; it is horrible blasphemy so to think; &amp; vnto death you say they continued.

<Q>For fearing is a true feeling, and if Christ feared the wrath of God, <HI>ergo</HI> he felt it.</Q>
You recken a pace when you recken alone, but when you come for allowance you will lacke a faire deale of your reckning. If fearing wore suffering, which is most ab|surd; if there were no kind of feare, but your amazed and all confounded feare, as there be more other kinds of feares; if there were noe more parts of the wrath of God, but hell paines, as there be sundrie more; if no man might feare but for himselfe, as in charitie wee may, and in duty we ought to feare for others, and Christ in loue might and did for vs; then had you some hope, that he which granteth the one, would admit the other: but if this be all you can saie, that feare is a kind of feeling, I am as farre from granting the Question, as I was in the first beginning. For though you dallie with doubtfull words, and thinke it enough to catch here and there at a likelihood, my course is not so. In|d&eacute;ede out of these words I reasoned vppon your owne prin|ciples: and supposing it for the time to be true which on this place some auouch, that Christ feared the paines of hell, I concluded, if Christ were deliuered from fearing, he was certainlie deliuered from suffering the paines of hell. And before you answere the argument, you triumph as if the Question were granted. But Syr remember it
<PB N="305" REF="160">
is the suffering of hell paines that we talke of, and not of a Metaphoricall kinde of f&eacute;eling; which you substitute in st&eacute;ed thereof. Againe all the effects of Gods wrath Christ did not feele, nor feare, as namelie, neither reprobation, nor desperation, nor eternall damnation, which is the chiefest and sharpest effect of Gods iust wrath against sinne. Some partes thereof if hee did feare, and so in affection feele, howe doth it followe hee felt or feared hell paines? Thirdlie, hee did sustaine as well our person, as our cause; hee had not onelie compassion on vs, but coniunction with vs; and in that respect as our head hee might worthilie feare the euerlasting destruction of his bodie, if he did not interpose himselfe, and auert Gods wrath from them, by healing them with his owne stripes, and bearing their sinnes in his owne bodie. Fourthlie he might feare the power of Gods wrath, able to punish euen the bodie of Christ with farre more smart, then his humane flesh was able to endure. Last|lie, hee might carefullie shunne and decline both our sinne and the wages of our sinne, which is eternall death with a re|ligious feare, as content to redeeme vs, but not to destroie both himselfe and vs.</P>
<P>And this commeth n&eacute;erest the signification of the Gr&eacute;ek worde there vsed, which is no confused or amazed feare, such as you woulde cunninglie conuey vnder the name of <HI>a</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag</HI> 74.</NOTE> <HI>perplexed feare,</HI> but a carefull and diligent regarde to be|ware and decline that, which wee mislike or doubt. And therefore <GAP DESC="foreign"> is not onelie one that feareth God by taking good care not to displease him, but a circumspect and warie man in other thinges; and <GAP DESC="foreign"> is circum|spection and warinesse in priuate or publique affaires, as well as Religion to GOD. Nowe because the bol|der men are, the sooner they aduenture on anie thing, and the more fearefull, the more h&eacute;ede they take what they do; <GAP DESC="foreign"> by consequent signifieth an inclination rather to feare, then presumption; but it is lesse then <GAP DESC="foreign">, which

<P>For a farewell to his speciall reasons, the Confuter hath reserued matters of most speciall moment to the last: and because they are weightie and neede good proofe, hee hath searched the bottome of his studie, and sheweth vs here

the depth as well of his reading, as vnderstanding. Out of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrues</HI> he citeth these wordes; <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>Christ through death abolished him that had the power of death, that is the Diuell.</HI>

I haue onelie sette them togither, that thou maiest with one view behold both the deepnes and soundnesse of this vpstart writer; and in thy secrete and vp|right iudgement, is it not patience enough to heare and en|dure a two legged creature to talke in this sort without all learning, religion or discretion, controlling all the fathers as fooles, for thinking otherwise then hee doth, commaun|ding the Scriptures <HI>pretor-like,</HI> to serue his ignorant and lewd assertions, and est&eacute;eming none to be sober or conside|rate, except they confesse his shamefull absurdities to bee most true and euident? But I haue not learned nor vsed to giue reuiling sp&eacute;eches, the Lorde reprooue his follie. Though it bee not worth the answering, yet for their sakes that bee simple, I will not refuse to speake to it, and to let them see what difference there is betwixt truth and errour.</P>
<P><HI>Your maine reason (Sir Refuter) is this, in these wordes of the Apostle,</HI><Q>Christ through death abolished the diuell that had power of death. This worde <HI>DEATH (say you)</HI> hath the same meaning in both places, <HI>the proofe you make for it is this,</HI> verie fond it were to take it here otherwise. <HI>Your assumption is,</HI> but death in the latter place questionlesse signifieth the death of the soule; Therefore Christ died the death of the soule.</Q>
It were as easie for mee to saie, it is not so; as for you to saie, it is so; but that course which you holde is but prating of euerie thing, it is no proouing of anie thing. Howe manie kinds of death there are, wee shall better learne by the graue father Saint <HI>Austen,</HI> then by the young louers in <HI>Terence</HI>: <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>August. serm.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">29.</NOTE> <HI>Dicitur mors prima, dicitur &amp; secunda.

<PB N="309" REF="162">
the sinfull soule by offending departed from her Creator; the o|ther whereby the soule for her punishment was excluded from her bodie by Gods iustice. The second death is the euerlasting torment of bodie and soule.</HI> The same partes and kindes of death are often repeated by him in his 13. booke <HI>de ciuitate Dei</HI>; as namelie,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>August. de ciuitate dei. lib.</HI> 13. <HI>cap.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>Mors animae fit cum eam deserit Deus, sicut corporis cum id deserit anima.

The death of the soule is, when God forsaketh her, as the death of the bodie is, when the soule forsaketh the bodie. So y^e death of both, that is of the whole man is when the soule forsaken of God forsaketh her bodie. For so neither she liueth by God, nor the bodie by her. This death of the whole man, that other death followeth; which the diuine scriptures call the second death, for that last and euerlasting pu|nishment is rightlie called the death of the soule.</HI> Here are thr&eacute;e kinds of death; sinne which separateth vs from God, bodilie death, which separateth the soule from the body, and eternall damnation which tormenteth body and soule for euer. In the Apostles words to the <HI>Hebrues,</HI> that <HI>Christ through death abo+lished y^e diuell that had power of death</HI>; you wil by no meanes haue the death of the bodie intended; that is a benefite and gaine to the godlie. Then of sinne and eternall damnation the diuell must be said to haue power, and indeede so he hath. For hee is the perswader and leader to sinne, and the ex|ecutioner and tormentor in damnation. And so by your di|uinitie Christ must sinne, and be euerlastinglie condemned to hell fire, before he can abolish the Diuell that hath power of both these. For he must abolish him, by the same kind of death, whereof hee hath power. Looke, Sir Refu|ter, what an wholsome exposition of the Apostles words you haue made vs, which the diuell himselfe durst not aduenture,
<PB N="310" REF="163">
it is so blasphemous. God forbid you will say, this should be anie part of your meaning.

What the death of the soule is, what consequentes it hath, and what maine and moste sufficient reasons there are, why Christ neither did, nor might die the death of the soule, thou hast (good Rea|der) before in the Treatise it selfe: if this fumbler either will skippe them, or can not answere them, I must not repeate them as often as hee will neglect them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide pag.</HI> 73.</NOTE> Yet to ease thee of going backe, I will here giue thee the effect thereof.</P>

For thy bodie to die, is to loose his life; and for thy soule to die, is to loose her life. The life of thy bodie is thy soule. The life of thy soule is thy God.

But awake, Sir Refuter, and you shall s&eacute;e great difference betwixt the doctrine taught in the booke of <HI>Homi|lies,</HI> and publikely approoued by the lawes of this Realme, your frenzies; that Christ <HI>DIED</HI> the <HI>DEATH</HI> of the <HI>SOVLE</HI>; that the <HI>VVHOLE CVRSE</HI> of God was executed on Christ; that he was by our sins <Q><HI>defiled, sinful, hateful, &amp; accursed; that al the powers of his soule &amp; senses of his body were ouerwhelmed, distrac|ted, and all confounded, that he felt the verie Diuels to be instru|ments, executing the wrath of God vpon him, that the sufferings of Christs soule,</HI> by <HI>Sympathie</HI> as you call it, (that is from and by the body) <HI>make not to our redemption; that Christs soule died and was crucified, where it is absurd and most false to say Christ was made aliue ether in his humane soule, or by the same</HI>; </Q>these and an hundred such absurdities and impieties haue no al|lowance in the bookes of <HI>Homilies,</HI> nor any thing sounding towards your hellish paines of the damned.
The doctrine there taught is sound, true and plaine, that we are redeemed by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus; that such was the iust displeasure of God against our sinnes, that though he were his owne son, that vndertooke the cause for vs, the iustice of God pursued him with most painfull smart and anguish e|uen vnto death; and forced the weaknesse of his humane flesh to crie, <HI>my God, my God why hast thou forsaken mee.</HI> But you content not your selfe with this; you must haue him suffer the verie paines of the damned in Hell, or nothing.

<P>Thou hast heard christian Reader, what things I haue mis|liked in the first part of this opponents pamphlet; but no|thing more then this, that he wasteth so manie wordes, and neither expresseth what hee meaneth, nor proueth what hee pretendeth.

The wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to come by a trueth, is to specifie the partes of Gods wrath and curse, which they suppose Christ suffered, and then shall wee in fewe wordes trie whether those suffe|rings accord with the rules and groundes of the scriptures, or no.

bring a sacke full of words for so waightie matters; but plainlie and particularlie declaring what he holdeth, and proouing what he affirmeth, go directly to the point, and then by Gods grace we shall soone trie where trueth standeth.

<P>In the second Question of Christs descent to hell, I shall not hold thee long (gentle reader) because this babler forgetting what I sayd, concerning the proofe and purpose of Christs descent to hell, runneth a new course to <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Poets</HI> for help, to expound that article of our Creede; and there presumeth&punc; himselfe to be so strong, that of the rest he doth prate without reason or remembrance. The end of Christs descent to hell, I noted out of <HI>Athanasius, Fulgen|tius</HI> and others, and prooued their speach conformable to the Scriptures; the places thou hast in the latter part of the trea|tise, I meane not to increase this close with n&eacute;edlesse repeti|tions. The Co~futer, belike distracted and distempered with the cogitation and confusion of his hell paines, vtterly mis|taketh or forgetteth the whole.
He supposeth Christs descent to hell had none other purpose, but <Q><NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 64.</NOTE> <HI>to triumph and insult vp|on the thrice miserable and wofull wretches in their present vn|speakeable damnation, infinitely confounded alreadie, &amp; inferreth; Sure a verie sorie triumph this were for the sonne of God which e|uen among men were nothing but dishonorable</HI>; </Q>but if his braines be so bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kle, that he can neither conceaue, nor carrie a|waie what I sayd; I must not beate it into his head: that I then preached, is here now printed, let him refell it if hee can.
Soe when I made the subduing of hell and treading on Satan with all the power of darknesse, a chiefe part of the glorie of Chrits resurrection, this scor|ner in his foolish conceite mocketh at it, and saith <Q><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 54.</NOTE> <HI>a worthie

In sadnes (Syr refuter) if these be your best exceptions against Christs triumphing ouer hell, <HI>all the world</HI> will know, that you are a worthie man, to weare a woodden dagger. The Apostle made it a part of Christs <HI>high exaltation,</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Philip.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>that euerie knee, as well of things vnder the earth, as of things in heauen, should bow vnto him, and euerie toong confesse that Iesus Christ is the Lord</HI>; and do you thinke it a m&eacute;ete matter to be mocked and derided?
<HI>Paul saith; Christ spoyled principalities and powers (of hell &amp; darknes) and made a shew of them openlie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coloss. 2.</HI></NOTE> <HI>and triumphed ouer them in his owne person, (for so I must reade till you shew me better authoritie against it, then I haue brought for it;) &amp; your selfe both s&eacute;e and sate, that</HI><Q> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Pag. <HI>156.</HI></NOTE> whyles Christ suffered and whyles he died, it was a mi|serable triumph, yea <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Pag. <HI>159.</HI></NOTE> a piteous triumph it was indeede, where himselfe remayned in such woful torme~ts, where appeared no shew of conquest, but rather of being conquered; &amp; <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">pag. <HI>156.</HI></NOTE> stil he suffered til he gaue vp the ghost.</Q>
What letteth them I praie you, since these words were not verified on the Crosse, but they did take place in his resurrection, as I teach; and therein as by the effects it was most euident and apparant to the eies of all men, he did spoyle powers and principalities, &amp; made a shew of them openly, and triumphed ouer them in his owne per|son?

Is the subduing of

hell powers, and the treading on all their force, and the re|straining of all their furie, so small a matter with you, that it doth no good to the godlie?

<Q>[<HI>The redemption of Gods elect, was</HI> (you say) <HI>fully finished on the Crosse.</HI>]</Q> Deserued and obtained it was on the Crosse, and by the crosse, but not there executed.
There were our sinnes pardoned, and our selues reconciled to God; but as Christ died for our sinnes, so he rose for our ius<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ification. His resurrectio~ in that glorious manner, which I haue mentioned in the treatise, &amp; his ascension are necessa|ry parts of our Saluation; and therefore vse not the force of Christs crosse to exclude, but to induce the rest.

Wherfore</HI> (that is euen for that his humility &amp; obedience) <HI>God hath highly exalted him &amp; giuen him a name aboue euerie name; that at the name of Ie|sus should euery knee bow of things in heauen, in earth, &amp; vnder the earth.</HI> So that his <HI>descending, rising,</HI> and <HI>ascending</HI> added nothing to the force of his death, but shewed the fruite there|of; and tend all to our good, since wee are presentlie secured from the power of hell and Satan, and shall be certainelie raysed and receaued to glorie. Christes death without his resurrection and ascension had beene our confusion&punc; and no redemption; for if sinne had slaine him with|out rising, it must needes haue damned vs without hoping: now in his Resurrection as euery Enemie was most mighty, so was there most n&eacute;ed he should be subdued.

very excellent tale which you will thinke a fable, but I a good lesson. That which I will saie, I will speake to you for a trueth. As Homer reporteth, Iupiter, Neptune, and Pluto deuided the gouernement, after they receaued it of their father. There was a lawe touching men vnder Saturnus, and euer was and still is with the gods, that such men as led a iust and holie life, when they departed hence shoulde goe to the Iles of the blessed, and there liue in all happinesse without any euill; and they that had beene wicked and vngodlie should goe to the prison of punish|ment and vengeance which is called Tartarus. The iudges of these matters, in Saturnes time, and in the beginning of Iupiters raigne were the liuing of such as yet liued, and gaue iudgement the same daie that each man should die, wherefore their iudge|ment was corrupt. PLVTO the~ and the Gardians of the blessed Ilands going to Iupiter tolde him, that there came vnto them men to either place vnmeete for that condition. To whome Iu|piter aunswered, I will see it redressed. The iudgementes are therefore now amisse, because they that are iudged are couered round, for they are iudged aliue, and so many that haue wicked soules are compassed with beauty, nobility, &amp; riches, and manie come to the place of iudgement, &amp; depose they liued honestlie, and so the iudges are astonished; as also the iudges the~selues are clogged, hauing their soules wrapped with their eies, and eares, and the rest of their bodie. First therfore men must be kept from foreseeing the time of their death. The~ they must be iudged whe~ they are naked from all these thinges, that is after death, and the Iudge likewise must be deade also, that he may be free fro~ these lets, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h his soule he must view the soule of euery man new|ly dead, forsaken of all his kind, &amp; stripped of al worldly pompe, that the iudgement may be sincere. And I foreseeing this before you, haue appointed Iudges, two of my sons Minos &amp; Rhada|manthus out of Asia, and a third which is Aeacus out of Europe. These when they are dead shall iudge in an open meade in the meeting of three waies, whereof two shall leade, one to the Iles of the blessed, another to Tartarus. The soules of Asia shall be

How much more did he condemne them, that thought all the deceased soules were beneath, vnder, or in the earth? The blessed hee thought rather, as Plato did, to ascend vp to heauen. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Pag. <HI>108.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Secondly, you note,</HI> That although hee reiected the opinion of the former Latines, yet hee retayned the La|tine phrase, as being now common and familiar euery where; which rose of olde from that opinion, thinking all the dead af|ter this life to be <HI>infra,</HI> beneath. He had learned to thinke wise|lier, but yet he spake so, as the vulgar phrase had preuailed, ac|cording to Aristotles rule; we must thinke as the wise doe, but speake as the people doe. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Tullie saith of this opinion followed great errors.</Q>
If a man would hire you to speake against your selfe, you cannot doe it in playner manner than here you doe. You confesse that <HI>Cicero</HI> was the first (for before him you bring none) that misliked the opi|nion of the olde Latines (whose seate and tongue in <HI>Ita|lie</HI> was then 1200. yeares olde) <HI>that the world of the dead was vnder the earth,</HI> and to signifie so much, they vsed the worde <HI>Inferi</HI>; which had continued in the mouthes of all men learned and vnlearned, till <HI>Ciceroes</HI> time, to expresse the state of the dead.
Secondly, you say the phrase was so <Q><HI>common and familiar euery where for the worlde of the dead,</HI> that <HI>Cicero</HI> himselfe, though hee thought
<PB N="387" REF="201">
otherwise durst not depart from <HI>the vulgare phrase which had so generally preuayled.</HI> </Q>Then by your owne confessi|on w&eacute;e haue thus much, that <HI>Inferi</HI> for twelue hun|dred yeares in the mouthes of all men ignorant, and learned among the <HI>Latines</HI> and <HI>Romanes</HI> did signifie the state of such soules as were vnder the earth.
Now let <HI>Ci|cero</HI> say what he can to the contrarie; his authoritie is no waie so great that it should ouerwaigh so long and setled a consent. <HI>Great errors followed hereof Tullie saith.</HI> And you affirme the like, but not so great as <HI>Tullie</HI> himselfe mayn|tayned in reiecting that opinion. For he in some pride of his tongue and conceite of his wit brought&punc; heauen and hell to be vtterly nothing.</P>
<P>That the old Latines thought all men after death to go vnder the earth I s&eacute;e no proofe; I find rather the contra|rie confessed by your owne author.

Hercules is gone to the Gods. These things are ancient and sea|led with the religious consent of all men.</HI> So that <HI>Ciceroes</HI> words which you alleage, cannot import that they thought so of all men, for then they must so haue thought of <HI>Romu|lus</HI> and <HI>Hercules,</HI> which <HI>Cicero</HI> confesseth all men acknow|ledge to be in heauen; but they supposed so of most men; which amongst Pagans, as they were, was no such great error, as you would make it, nor any way so great as that which <HI>Cicero</HI> laboured to establish in place thereof.

<P>[They mistooke, you will saie, the word <HI>Infernum</HI> in the old testament, and thence grew their opinio~, that the Patriarks and prophets before Christes comming went to hell; but the scriptures had no such meaning; for neither the worde <HI>Sheol</HI> with the <HI>Hebrues,</HI> nor the worde <HI>Hades</HI> with the Septuagint had any such sense, to signifie hell. And this a notable argu|ment, y^t <HI>Hades</HI> signifieth the world of soules, or generall state of the dead, were they in hel or in heauen.] Wee are all this while out of our proper element to sift heathen philosophers &amp; Poets for the meaning of the cr&eacute;ede, &amp; a little smattering in the Greeke tongue made the Refuter so arrogant, that hee bid defiance to all the fathers both gr&eacute;eke and Latin, as vn|able to vnderstande one poore word in the Cr&eacute;ede, which the church of Christ proposed to euerie childe to learne, and to e|uerie catechist to knowe. But nowe wee are returned to the scriptures againe, (for Fathers they leaue as corrupters of the olde both faith and phrase) wee shall goe through with more ease, and ende with more speede. That <HI>Sheol</HI> or <HI>Ha|des</HI> doe signifie heauen, either in the Scriptures of the

olde or newe Testament, or with the Septuagint which are the translators of the Hebrue into Gr&eacute;ek, I vtterlie denie; and no man liuing shall euer bee able to make anie proofe thereof; on which issue I am content to ioyne with any man that is learned and sober, for the hazard of either of our cre|dits. If <HI>Sheol,</HI> and <HI>Hades</HI> in the scriptures neuer signifie hea|uen, then can they not signifie <HI>THE VVORLD OF SOVLES</HI>: for so much as there is no one place common to all soules de|parted this life, but some are in hell, and some in heauen; and for one word to signifie both hell and heauen so farre dis|tant one from the other, and so much repugnant one to the o|ther, is somwhat strange, except it could be strongly proued. <HI>Chaos</HI> did import the whole masse of heauen and earth be|fore they were distinguished, but since they were seuered, and setled by the wonderful wisedome and mighty power of God so far apart one from the other, and so much vnlike one to the other, there are wordes in the scripture which note all that God made, but none that comprise heauen and hell, ex|cluding the rest. <HI>S.

For where wordes are common, some thinges must also be common, as n&eacute;edefull to bee expressed by those wordes; but to soules in heauen and hell no positiue thing is common; all things are rather contrarie. Their bodies they want in both places, because they are soules; otherwise their states be as repugnant in all points, as light and darknesse, Christ and Belial, yea as heauen and hell in which they are; &amp; therefore as light and darknes, faith and infidelitie, truth and errour haue no common worde to comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ise them being contraries each to other; no more haue heauen and hell as they are she rewardes of the iust and vniust; for so much as all things in either are directlie repugnant each to other.
<PB N="397" REF="206">
Again that <HI>SHEOL</HI> or <HI>HADES</HI> may possiblie signifie heauen I vtterly deny, because in heauen besides the soules of men, there are the elect angels of God, to whom if anie man dare applie <HI>SHEOL</HI> or <HI>HADES,</HI> he must giue me leaue to thinke his iudgement to be weake, and his faith vnsound.</P>
<P>[<HI>Sheol</HI> and <HI>Hades,</HI> you will saie signifie all that are deade in either place.] But you must remember, that both these wordes in the Scriptures doe properlie signifie places and not pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sons. For though the ancient Gr&eacute;ekes vsed the word <HI>HADES,</HI> first for a person, and then for the place which that person gouerned; yet the holie ghost (knowing that the per|son which the Pagans meant was in d&eacute;ede the Diuell) v|seth the worde for the place, and not for the person, except the texte bee figuratiue. In <HI>Sheol</HI> it was neuer doubted but that it alwaies signified a place, and neuer anie per|son. Nowe if neither <HI>Sheol</HI> nor <HI>Hades</HI> canne signifie both places, I meane heauen and hell, then canne they not sig|nifie the worlde of soules; for they bee dispersed in both those places.</P>
<P>[It cannot be denied, you wil saie, but the olde testament referreth <HI>She&ocirc;l,</HI> as the Septuagint doe <HI>Hades,</HI> both to the godlie and to the wicked after death.] It is most true that <HI>She&ocirc;l</HI> in Hebrew, and <HI>Hades</HI> in Greeke are applied in the olde Testament both to the good and bad; The Question is not to what men, but to which parts of men, good or bad, <HI>Sheol</HI> and <HI>Hades</HI> are referred. To the bodies of men, good and bad, lying deade in the graue they are sometimes applied; to the soules of the godlie, as detained in either, they are neuer applied. <HI>Sheol</HI> and consequentlie <HI>HADES</HI> with the Septuagint, importeth the whole death that is due to sinne, and euerie part thereof; but by no meanes heauen, where the soules of the saintes are, nor anie part of that blisse, which they possesse. Since then as well the death of the bodie in this worlde, as the death of the soule in the next worlde were the wages of sinne; <HI>Sheol</HI> and <HI>Hades</HI>
<PB N="398" REF="207">
doe sometimes signifie the generall state of deade bodies, as when the Scripture describeth <HI>rottennesse, silence, for|getfulnesse, senselessenesse, contempt, dishonour,</HI> and such like to bee in <HI>Sheol.</HI> And the same worde when it is referred to the soules of the wicked as there detained, or of the god|lie as thence deliuered; for so much as the soule cannot be inclosed in the graue; of necessitie the pit prepared for the soules of sinners must bee, by all such textes of Scrip|tures, intended. But that <HI>Sheol</HI> or <HI>Hades</HI> shoulde sig|nifie the worlde of Soules, as well in heauen as in Hell, neither hath this Refuter brought anie Texte or reason for it, neither will hee euer bee able to prooue it. And howsoeuer one of late hath taken vppon him to talke of those thinges, like one of the <HI>Titanes</HI> with bigge and bombasted tearmes; I, seeing nothing in that fardell of his but Riddles and raylinges, meane not to al|ter my course.</P>
<P>Then touching the sense of <HI>Sheol</HI> in the olde Testa|ment, I take it to bee cleare, that it sometimes signifieth the graue or the state of deade bodies; but neuer the world of soules, which phrase the Refuter hath caught by the ende, hoping at length to conueie it into the Creede. But hee must first shewe vs where hee findeth anie such thing in the Scriptures, before wee maie suffer him to make it an Article of our faith. Against it euerie place is a proofe; but for it none that I reade, or they haue yet alleaged. They shifte handes, and in steede of the worlde of soules they bring in the graue, or the state of deade bodies; which is but a vaine flourish, to propose one thing, and to prooue an other.
And though you (Sir Refuter) goe to varying of phrases which I thinke is your best skill; as, <Q><NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 97.</NOTE> <HI>The state of the deade, the worlde of the deade, the worlde of soules departed</HI>;</Q> yet I must let you vnderstande there is great difference be|twixt these speeches.

euerie point without exception: And that maketh me who|lie to skippe the handling of <HI>HADES</HI> in the Septuagint; and to referre the discussing thereof till I come to the pla|ces of the newe Testament. Now the consequent of that I haue alleaged either heere or before, is this; that by <HI>SHEOL</HI> and <HI>HADES</HI> in the olde Testament must n&eacute;edes be meante either <HI>HELL,</HI> the <HI>GRAVE,</HI> or their <HI>VVORLDE OF SOVLES,</HI> which they so much talke of; if no place in the olde Testament doe necessarilie enforce their worlde of soules to bee vnderstoode by either of these wordes, then it remaineth, that in what textes the graue maie not bee endured to bee the meaning of either of these wordes, there wee conceaue the place of the damned must bee in|tended in either of them.

All these places serue fitlie for hell, and the most of them neces|sarilie; since either is expressed as a diuerse thing from <HI>HADES,</HI> or not to bee comprised in the name of <HI>HADES.</HI>
<PB N="409" REF="212">
But your <HI>world of soules</HI> is most absurd and false in euery one of these, and can not stand with the circumstance of the text, the first of the <HI>Reuelation</HI> onelie excepted, where though there be no wordes to impugne it, yet are there none to approue it. For is it anie curse for <HI>Capernaum,</HI> to bee brought to the worlde of soules, except you meane hell?

It therefore remaineth that though <HI>HADES</HI> with the Septuagint signifie either <HI>BODILIE DEATH</HI> or <HI>HELL</HI>; yet in the new Testament where <HI>HADES</HI> is described as a diffe|rent thing from <HI>DEATH,</HI> and following <HI>AFTER DEATH, HADES</HI> of necessitie, being <HI>NOT DEATH,</HI> must needes im|port <HI>HELL.</HI> Of the place in question, <HI>Thou wilt not leaue my soule in HADES,</HI> I will yet saie nothing, but will come to the words of the Creede, <HI>Christ descended to HADES,</HI> and search what must be the meaning of <HI>HADES</HI> in that article.</P>
<P>What I take to be the meaning of <HI>Hades</HI> in the Creede, where it is said, <HI>Christ descended to HADES,</HI> as also what rea|sons lead me thereunto, thou hast, Christan Reader, in the for|mer <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Pa.</HI> 171.</NOTE> treatise, thou shalt with more ease finde it there, then I repeat it here; howe much this Confuter confesseth or resisteth, that must I now examine. When I obiect that in a short sum of the Christian faith made for the simple and common people, to repeate one thing twice were n&eacute;edlesse, and against the nature of the Creede: and to vse a darke and hard phrase after a plaine and easie, is vnreasonable and absurde; he answereth, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 126.</NOTE>
<Q>It is true. I hold it vnreasonable altogither in the short and vulgar Creed, appointed euen for the common Christians, to vse words darke and difficult. And when the same thing is by diuers words expres|sed, the later ought to be the lighter and cleerer. Therefore I fullie grant, in the Creede speciallie, the phrase must be familiar, triuiall, easie and plaine.</Q><HI>I vrged thr&eacute;e things to be obserued in the ex|pounding
<PB N="410" REF="213">
the Creede, the words to be proper and euident with|out figuratiue obscuritie, the things to be different without idle repetition, and the order to be consequent without anie confu|sion.</HI>
The Confuter agreeth with me in all these; and he doub|teth not but his exposition is such. Since then there be three expositions of that article, Christ descended to <HI>HADES</HI>; that is either to the <HI>GRAVE,</HI> or to <HI>HELL,</HI> or to the <HI>VVORLDE OF SOVLES,</HI> which in Christes case (you saie) was <HI>HEAVEN</HI>; which of these thr&eacute;e, Sir Refuter, commeth neerest to the na|ture of a short, easie, and orderlie summe of a Creede? The first you like not, because it expresseth that in darke and hard cir|cumloquution, which was familiarly and plainely said before, <HI>he was dead and buried.</HI>
The question then resteth betweene the two last, which of the twaine best expresseth the proper sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag. 125.</HI></NOTE> and vulgar vse of the worde <HI>HADES.</HI> <Q><HI>For the Apostles and Apostolike men</HI> (you confesse) <HI>did so write and speake, as the people then might best vnderstand.</HI></Q>
If it bee so, then your expo|sition, (Sir Refuter) is cleane thrust out of doores. For nei|ther with the auncient Maisters of the Gr&eacute;eke tongue, which were the Poets, nor with the Septuagint, nor with the writers of the newe Testament, nor with the people of that time, in their vnderstanding, did <HI>HADES</HI> euer signifie the worlde of soules without anie limitation of state, or place. Againe that generall and indefinite worlde of soules, without respect of hell or heauen, is no point nor part of the Christian faith. For faith touching Christ must not be generall or am|biguous, but particular and certaine. It is no faith, much lesse an article of the faith, to saie, Christes soule after death went <HI>some whither</HI>; the Creede muste specifie the place whither it went before it can bee a matter of faith, that must bee beleeued. And therefore <HI>HADES</HI> doeth point out the particular place, as hell or heauen whither Christes soule went after death, before any man may chalenge it to be the true meaning of that article.</P>
<P><HI>If anie doe aske particularlie whither is this? You aun|swer,</HI> <Q><NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Pag: <HI>128:</HI></NOTE>namely into heauen: for whither should the Saints go else?</Q>

You like a tyrant ouer the Scriptures, will haue what sense pleaseth you in euerie place; and then you saie it is plaine and common. In d&eacute;ede your ignorance and insolencie is verie plaine and common; but the interpretations which you make of Scripture, be absurde and more then foolish. A man liuing maie well be said to descend into his graue; liuing hee standeth, dying he lieth downe; and the face of the earth on which we are, is higher then the bowels of the earth where wee lie buried; but of a soule ascending vp to heauen, to say it de|scendeth to hell, is a phrase of your making, and fit for your faith; which is guided more by will then by truth. When you proue these two points, that <HI>HADES</HI> is <HI>HEAVEN</HI> in the Scrip|tures, and that <HI>DESCENDING IS ASCENDING,</HI> we will hearken to your exposition; till then wee will leaue it as a dis|temper of your vnsetled braine.</P>

Is this all you haue to saie (Sir Refuter,) then when pro|uender is deuided you shall haue a part for your good collectio~. You collect that y^e later Synode by leauing out certain words of the former <HI>renounceth</HI> that <HI>CHRIST AFTER DEATH VVENT TO HELL</HI>; and that which it retaineth of the former Synode in expresse wordes is this; <HI>IT I TO BE BELEE|VED THAT CHRIST VVENT DOVVN INTO HELL.</HI> So in your iudgement by <HI>beleeuing that Christ wente downe into Hell, they renounce, that Christ went to hell.</HI> If it were a matter of sight I shoulde aske whether you had anie eies or no; nowe it is a matter of reason I must more doubte whe|ther you haue your fiue wittes or no. Set your inference to the viewe of all men. The Synode in her Maiesties time a|greeth, <HI>It is to be beleeued that Christ vvent downe into hell. Ergo they appara~tly renounce that Christ went to hel.</HI> This is your conclusion; shew it to any tapster or tinker in Englande and s&eacute;e whether he will reward you with a mocke or no.</P>
<P>[But they leaue out the latter part of the Article which the former Synode concluded.] So they leaue out <HI>that Christs bodie vvas in his graue vntill his resurrection,</HI> which are the wordes of the former Synode. Is the omitting of this a ma|nifest renouncing and abrogating of it? God forbid [But the first Synode in king Edwardes time added farther, you saie, <HI>that Christs spirit vvas vvith the spirits detained in Prison or in
<PB N="419" REF="217">
hel; and preached vnto them.</HI>] First then tell your <HI>abettor,</HI> that al the Realme wil take him not only for a <HI>Railor</HI> against al <HI>ho|nesty,</HI> but for a <HI>lier</HI> against al <HI>duty,</HI> that voucheth so confidently <HI>king Edward the sixt and his subiects held that Christ his soule neuer vvent to Gehenna; &amp; the realme knoweth the Q. othe; as also the Q. aduentureth her eternal state.</HI> These be no states to come within the compasse of his vncleane mouth: He may doe well to remember who they be, of whom it is written:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iudae epistola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI></NOTE> <HI>They despise gouernment, &amp; speak euil of those that are in authori|tie, as raging vvaues of the Sea, foming out their owne shame</HI>; And to take h&eacute;ed, that he proue not too true a prophet against himselfe in paying the price of misusing his liege and Soue|raigne Ladie, and her whole Realme. But I wish him re|pentance and so I leaue him. Secondlie, (Sir Refuter) you maie see three thinges in the latter wordes of that Article in king Edwardes Synode, which are verie wiselie with si|lence ouerskipped by the Synode in her Maiesties time; and wherein for my part I thinke they did verie well not to adde to this Article, anie time, purpose, or prisoners, when, why, or to whome Christ descended. But therein to imitate the wisedome of the best ages, who kept this Article as they founde it without enterlacing it with anie newe additions. For in the later wordes of that former Synode nowe left out are three thinges that cannot bee iustified by the Scriptures. 1. that the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the <HI>iust vvere in hell.</HI> 2. that <HI>Christ there preached</HI> vnto them. 3. that he <HI>staied</HI> there <HI>till</HI> his <HI>resurrecti|on.</HI> These three pointes contained in the Article of that Sy|node; were aduisedlie and profitablie suppressed by the Synode kept in her maiesties time; and these are the pointes which I my selfe impugne in this Treatise, as hauing no iust nor tolerable grounde in the Scriptures. But these thinges be|ing drowned by omission, what is that to the rest of the article, which the later Synode imbraceth as a matter necessarie to be beleeued? for thus they resolue;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Articul.</HI> 3</NOTE> <HI>As Christ died for vs &amp; vvas bu|ried; so also it is to be beleeued y^t HE VVENT DOVVN INTO HELL,</HI> And though you woulde weaken their resolution with a false translation, as your maner is, by making them saie, <HI>vve are to beleeeue that Christ vvent vnto the dead,</HI> yet may you gain no thing by that, for we haue publike assurance &amp; allowance that
<PB N="420" REF="218">
their words were and are <HI>IT IS TO BE BELEEVED THAT CHRIST VVENT DOVVNE INTO HELL.</HI> Their words in Latin were, you will say, <HI>Cre|dendus est ad inferos descendisse</HI>? But the same Bishops &amp; the same Clergie that were at the first Synode in the 5 of her Ma|iesty, assembling again in the 13 yeare of her highnes raign, did themselues english it as I report it, and offered it to the Prince &amp; Parliament in those words to be co~firmed, which according|ly that high Court did. So y^t now not these words, Christ de|scended into <HI>HADES,</HI> though they be true as being the originall words, much lesse yours Christ <HI>went to the dead,</HI> but preciselie these, <HI>Christ went downe into hell,</HI> are the faith &amp; doctrine which the Church &amp; Realme of England professeth, or which the lawe establisheth; and what they meane, were it not for your addle quirckes, is soone perceaued euen of the simplest.</P>
<P><HI>You conclude that the</HI><Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Page <HI>173</HI></NOTE> publike sentence of our Church, yea the publike law of our land is against this opinio~ of Christs descen|ding into hell.</Q>
And I conclude likewise that which is in the bone will neuer out of the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh; with arrogance and ignorance you began, and so you will end. If <HI>HELL</HI> in english be <HI>HELL,</HI> &amp; <HI>GOING DOVVNE</HI> be <HI>DESCENDING, the~ both the Church &amp; the law of Eng|land directly, expressely, precisely mayntayneth CHRISTS DE|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">CENDING INTO HELL,</HI> If <HI>HELL</HI> in english be <HI>HEAVEN</HI>; &amp; <HI>GOING DOVVN</HI> be <HI>GOING VP,</HI> then the Church and lawe of England fauoureth your fansie. And hereof I am wel content thou shalt be Iudge (Christian Reader) that vnderstandest best thine owne toong. For the latine <HI>INFE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">NVM</HI> and the Gr&eacute;eke <HI>HADES</HI> I am content to be tried by all Fathers, Greeke &amp; Latine that euer wrate in the Church of Christ. If these men ca~not keepe their quarter cl&eacute;ere nor vpholde their conceite, but they must exclude all <HI>Greeke, Latine,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> diuines since Christs time from vnderstanding euerie man his owne naturall toong; I will see their braines better settled, and their mouthes b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter tem|pred, before their philosophicall follies and Rabbinicall fancies the one sorte being strangers, the other enimies to the faith of Christ, shall draw mee from my Creede. And so I wish thee (Christian Reader) as my selfe, mercie and grace from the Lord Iesus, and commit thee to God.</P>
