<HEAD>THE
Preface.</HEAD>
<P>ABout six and twenty years ago, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<HI>Design for the Recording of illustri|ous
Providences,</HI> was under serious consi|deration
among some eminent Ministers
in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Ireland.</HI> That mo|tion
was principally set on foot by the
Learned Mr. <HI>Matthew Pool,</HI> whose <HI>Synop|sis
Criticorum,</HI> and other Books by him e|mitted,
have made him famous in the
World. But before any thing was
brought to effect, the Persons to have
been imployed, had their thoughts di|verted
another way. Nevertheless, there
was a M. SS. (the Composer whereof is
to me unknown) then written, wherein
<PB REF="3">
the Subjects proper for this <HI>Record,</HI> and
some Rules for the better managing a
design of this nature, are described. In
that <HI>M. SS.</HI> I find notable Stories related
and attested, which elsewhere I never
met with. Particularly, the Sory of Mr.
<HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Colchester,</HI> and another mention|ed
in our <HI>subseqnent Essay.</HI> And besides
those, there are some very memorable
Passages written, which have not as yet
been published, so far as I understand.
There are in that <HI>M. SS.</HI> several <HI>Remarka|bles</HI>
about <HI>Apparitions,</HI> e. g. It is there
said, that Dr. <HI>Frith,</HI> (who was one of the
Prebends belonging to <HI>Windsor)</HI> lying
on his Bed, the Chamber Doors were
thrown open, and a Corps with attend|ing
Torches brought to his Bed-side
upon a Bier; The Corps representing
one of his own Family: After some
pause, there was such another shew, till
he, the said Dr. his Wife and all his Fa|mily
were brought in on the Bier in
such order as they all soon after died.
The Dr. was not then sick, but quickly
<PB REF="3">
Melancholly, and would rising at Mid|night
repair to the Graves and monu|ments
at <HI>Eaton Colledge;</HI> saying, that he
and his must shortly take up their habi|tation
among the Dead. The Relater
of this Story (a Person of great inte|grity)
had it from Dr. <HI>Frith</HI>'s Son, who
also added, <HI>My Fathers Vision is already
Executed upon all the Family but my self,
my time is next, and near at hand.</HI></P>
<P>In the mentioned <HI>M. SS.</HI> there is also
a marvelous Relation concerning a
young Scholar in <HI>France:</HI> For, it is there
affirmed, that this prophane Student,
having by extravagant courses outrun his
means; in his discontent walking soli|tarily,
a Man came to him, and enquired
the cause of his sadness. Which he own|ing
to be want of Money, had presently
a supply given him by the other. That
being quickly consumed upon his Lusts;
as soon as his Money was gone his Dis|content
returned; and in his former
Walk, he met with his former Reliever,
who again offered to supply him; but
<PB REF="4">
askt him to contract with him to be
his, and to sign the contract with his
Blood. The woful wretch consented:
but not long after, considering that this
contract was made with the Devil; the
terrors of his Conscience became insup|portable;
so as that he endeavoured to
kill himself to get out of them. Some
Ministers, and other Christians being in|formed
how matters were circumstanced,
kept dayes of Prayer for him and with
him: and he was carefully watched that
so he might be kept from self-Murder.
Still he continued under Terror, and said
he should do so, as long as the Covenant
which he had signed, remained in the
hands of the Devil. Hereupon, the Mi|nisters
resolve to keep a day of Fasting
and Prayer in that very place of the
Field where the distressed creature had
made the woful Bargain, setting him in
the midst of them. Thus they did, and
being with special actings of Faith much
enlarged to pray earnestly to the Lord
to make known his power over Satan,
<PB REF="4">
in constraining him to give up that con|tract,
after some hours continuance in
Prayer, a Cloud was seen to spread it self
over them, and out of it the very con|tract
signed with the poor crearures
Blood was dropped down amongst them;
which being taken up and viewed, the
party concerned took it, and tore it in
pieces. The Relator had this from the
mouth of Mr. <HI>Beaumond,</HI> a Minister of
Note at <HI>Caon</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> who assured
him that he had it from one of the Mi|nisters
that did assist in carrying on the
Day of prayer when this memorable
providence hapned. Nor is the Rela|tion
impossible to be true, for <HI>Luther</HI>
speaks of a providence not unlike unto
this, which hapned in his Congregation.</P>
<P>This <HI>M. SS.</HI> doth also mention some
most <HI>Remarkable Iudgments</HI> of God upon
Sinners, as worthy to be Recorded for
Posterity to take notice of. It is there
said, that when Mr. <HI>Richard Iuxon</HI> was a
Fellow of <HI>Kings Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI>
he led a most vicious life: and whereas&punc;
<PB REF="5">
such of the Students as were serious in
matters of Religion, did endeavour by
solemn Fasting and Prayer to prepare
themselves for the Communion which
was then (this was about the year 1636)
on <HI>Easter-Day.</HI> This <HI>Iuxon</HI> spent all the
time of preparation in Drunken wild
Meetings, and was up late and Drunk
on the Saturday night. Nevertheless,
on the Lords day, he came with others
to the Communion, and sat next to the
Relator, who knowing his Disorder the
night before, was much troubled: but
had no remedy; Church-Discipline not
being then so practised as ought to have
been. The Communion being ended,
such of the Scholars as had the fear of
God in their hearts, repaired to their
Closets. But this <HI>Iuxon</HI> went immedi|ately
to a Drunken-meeting, and there
to a Cockfight, where he fell to his ac|customed
madness, and pouring out a
volley of Oaths and Curses; while these
were between his Lips, God smote him
dead in the twinkle of an eye. And though
<PB REF="5">
<HI>Iuxon</HI> were but young, and of a comely
person, his Carcase was immediately so
corrupted as that the stench of it was in|sufferable,
insomuch that no house would
receive it; and his Friends were forced
to hire some base Fellows to watch the
Carcase till night; and then with Pitch
and such like Gums covered him in a
Coffin, and so made a shift to endure his
Interment. There stood by a Scholar,
whose name was <HI>George Hall,</HI> and who
acted his part with <HI>Iuxon</HI> in his prophane|ness:
but he was so astonished with this
amazing Providence of God, as that he
fell down upon his knees, begging par|doning
mercy from Heaven, and vowing
a Reformation; which vow the Lord en|abled
him to keep, so as that afterwards
he became an able and famous Minister
of the Gospel.</P>
<P>One strange passage more I shall here
relate out of the <HI>M. SS.</HI> which we have
thus far made mention of. Therein I
find part of a Letter transcribed; which
is as followeth:</P>
<Q><P><PB REF="6">
<HI>Lismore,</HI> Octob. 2. 1658. In ano|ther
part of this Countrey, a poor man
being suspected to have stollen a Sheep
was questioned for it; he forswore
the thing, and wished that if he had
stollen it, God would cause the
Horns of the Sheep to grow upon him.
This man was seen within these few
dayes by a Minister of great repute for
Piety, who saith, that the Man has
an Horn growing out of one corner of
his Mouth, just like that of a sheep:
from which he hath cut seventeen In|ches,
and is forced to keep it tyed by
a string to his Ear, to prevent its grow|ing
up to his eye: This Minister not
only saw but felt this Horn, and re|ported
it in this Family this week, as
also a Gentleman formerly did, who
was himself an eye-witness thereof.
Surely such passages are a Demonstra|tive
evidence that there is a God, who
judgeth in the Earth, and who though
he stay long, will not be mocked al|wayes.</P></Q>
<P><PB REF="6">
I shall say no more concerning the
<HI>M. SS.</HI> only that it was sent over to Re|verend
Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> by (as I suppose)
Mr. <HI>Hartlib.</HI> How it came to lie dor|mient
in his hands I know not: though
I had the happiness of special Intimacy
with that worthy Man, I do not remem|ber
that ever I heard him speak any thing
of it. But since his Death, looking o|ver
his <HI>M. SS's</HI> I met with this, and com|municated
it to other Ministers, who
highly approved of the noble design
aimed at therein. Soon after which, some
Proposals in order to the reviving of this
work were drawn up, and presented at a
general Meeting of the Ministers in this
Colony, <HI>May</HI> 12. 1681. which it may not
be unsuitable here to recite.</P>
<LIST>
<HEAD>Some PROPOSALS concerning the RE|CORDING
of Illustrious
PROVIDENCES.</HEAD>
<ITEM>I. IN Order to the promoving of a design
of this Nature, so as shall be indeed
for Gods Glory, and the good of Posterity,
<PB REF="7">
it is necessary that utmost care shall be ta|ken
that All, and Only <HI>Remarkable Pro|vidences</HI>
be Recorded and Published.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Such Divine Iudgements, Tempests,
Floods, Earth-quakes, Thunders as are unusu|al,
strange Apparitions or what ever else
shall happen that is Prodigious, Witchcrafts,
Diabolical Possessions, Remarkable Iudge|ments
upon noted Sinners: eminent Deli|verances,
and Answers of Prayer, are to be
reckoned among Illustrious Providences.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Inasmuch as we find in Scripture,
as well as in Ecclesiastical History, that
the Ministers of God have been improved
in the <HI>Recording</HI> and <HI>Declaring</HI> the works
of the Lord; and since they are in divers
respects under peculiar Advantages there un|to:
It is proposed, that each one in that ca|pacity
may diligently enquire into, and Re|cord
such <HI>Illustrious Providences</HI> as have
hapned, or from time to time shall happen,
in the places whereunto they do belong: and
that the Witnesses of such notable Occur|rents
<PB REF="7">
be likewise set down in Writing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Although it be true, that this De|sign
cannot be brought unto Perfection in
one or two years, yet it is much to be de|sired
that something may be done therein
out of hand, as a <HI>Specimen</HI> of a more
large Volumn, that so this work may be set
on foot, and Posterity may be encouraged to
go on therewith.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. It is therefore Proposed that the
Elders may concurre in desiring some one
that hath Leisure and Ability for the ma|nagement
of such an undertaking, with
all convenient speed to begin therewith.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. And that therefore other Elders do
without delay make Enquiry concerning the
<HI>Remarkable Occurrents</HI> that have formerly
<PB REF="8">
fallen out, or may fall out hereafter, where
they are concerned, and transmit them unto
the aforesaid person, according to the Di|rections
above specified, in order to a spee|dy
Publication.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. That Notice be given of these Pro|posals
unto our Brethren, the Elders of the
Neighbour Colonies, that so we may enjoy
their Concurrence, and Assistance herein.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. When any thing of this Nature
shall be ready for the Presse, it appears on
sundry Grounds very expedient, that it
should be read, and approved of at some
Meeting of the Elders, before Publication.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These things being Read and Conside|red;
the Author of this <HI>Essay,</HI> was de|sired
to begin the work which is here
done; and I am Engaged to many for
the Materials, and Informations which
the following Collections do consist of.
It is not easie to give an Account of
things, and yet no circumstantial mi|stakes
<PB REF="8">
attend what shall be related. Nor
dare I averr, that there are none such in
what follows. Only I have been care|ful
to prevent them; and as to the sub|stance
of each passage, I am well assured
it is according to Truth. That rare ac|cident
about the Lightning which cau|sed
a wonderful change in the Compas|ses
of a Vessel then at Sea, was as is in
the Book expressed <HI>Page</HI> 91. 92. Only it
is uncertain whether they were then
exactly in the Latitude of 38. For they
had not taken an Observation for seve|ral
dayes, but the Master of the Vessel
affirms that to be the Latitude so near
as they could conjecture. Since the
Needle was changed by the Lightning,
if a lesser Compass be set over it, the
Needle therein (or any other touched
with the Load-stone) will alter its pola|rity,
turn about to the South, as I have di|vers
times to my great admiration expe|rimented.
There is near the North-point
a dark spot, like as if it were burnt
with a drop of Brimstone, supposed to
<PB REF="9">
be caused by the Lightning. Whether
the <HI>Magnetic</HI> impressions on that part of
the Needle being dissipated by the heat
of the Lightning, and the <HI>effluvia</HI> on the
South end of the Needle only remaining
untouched thereby, be the true natural
reason of the marvelous alteration; or
whither it ought to be ascribed to some
other cause, the Ingenious may consider.</P>
<P>There is another Remarkable Passage
about Lightning which hapned at <HI>Dux|borough</HI>
in <HI>New-England,</HI> concerning
which I have lately received this follow|ing
Account.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 11. 1653. (being the Lords
Day) There were small drizling Showers,
attended with some seldome and scarce per|ceivable
rumbling Thunders until towards the
Evening; at what time Mr. <HI>Constant South|worth</HI>
of <HI>Duxbury</HI> returning home after e|vening
Exercise, in company with some
Neighbours, Discoursing of some extraordi|nary
Thunder-claps with Lightning, and the
awful effects and consequents thereof,) be|ing
come into his own House (there were
present in one room, himself, his Wife, two
<PB REF="9">
Children, <HI>viz. Thomas</HI> (he was afterwards
drowned) and <HI>Benjamin,</HI> (he was long after
this killed by the <HI>Indians)</HI> with <HI>Philip Delano</HI>
a Servant,) there broke perpendicularly o|ver
the said House and Room a most awful
and amazing clap of Thunder, attended with
a violent flash, or rather flame of Lightning;
which brake and shivered one of the Nee|dles
of the Katted or Wooden Chimney, car|rying
divers Splinters seven or eight Rods di|stance
from the House: it filled the Room
with Smoke and Flame. Set fire in the
Thatch of a Leanto which was on the back|side
of a Room adjoyning to the former, in
which the five persons abovementioned were.
It melted some Pewter, so that it ran into
drops on the out-side, as is often seen on Tin
ware; melted round holes in the top of a Fire|shovel
proportionable in quantity to a small
Goose-shot; struck Mrs. <HI>Southworths</HI> Arm
so that it was for a time benummed; smote
the young Child <HI>Benjamin</HI> in his Mothers'
Arms, deprived it of Breath for a space, and
to the Mothers apprehension squeased it as
flat as a Planck; smote a Dog stone-dead
which lay within two foot of <HI>Philip Delano,</HI>
the Dog never moved out of his place or po|tsture,
in which he was when smitten, but
giving a small yelp, and quivering with his
<PB REF="10">
toes, lay still, blood issuing from his Nose or
Mouth. It smote the said <HI>Philip,</HI> made his
right Arm senseless for a time, together with
the middle finger in special (of his right
hand) which was benummed, and turned as
white as Chalk or Lime, yet attended with
little pain. After some few hours that finger
began to recover its proper colour at the
Knuckle, and so did gradually whiten unto
its extremity; And although the said <HI>Delano</HI>
felt a most vioilent heat upon his Body, as if
he had been scorched in the midst of a vio|lent
burning fire, yet his Clothes were not
singed, neither had the smell of fire passed
thereon.</P>
<P>I could not insert this Story in its proper
place, because I received it after that Cha|pter
about Thunder and Lightning was Prin|ted.
Some credible persons who have been
Eye-witnesses of it, inform me, that the
Lightning in that House at <HI>Duxborough,</HI> did
with the vehemency of its flame, cause the
Bricks in the Chimney to melt like molten
lead: which particular was as Remarkable
as any of the other mentioned in the Narra|tive,
and therefore I thought good here to
add it.</P>
<P><PB REF="10">
In this <HI>ESSAY,</HI> I design no more
than a <HI>Specimen;</HI> And having (by the
good hand of God upon me) set this
Wheel a going, I shall leave it unto o|thers,
whom God has fitted, and shall
incline thereto, to go on with the under|taking.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Digressions</HI> I have made in di|stinct
Chapters, handling several consi|derable
<HI>Cases of Conscience,</HI> supposing it
not unprofitable, or improper so to do;
since the things related gave the occasi|on:
both Leisure and Exercise of Judge|ment
are required in the due perfor|mance
of a Service of this Nature:
There are some that have more leisure,
and many that have greater Abilities
than I have: I expect not that they
should make my <HI>Method</HI> their Standard;
but they may follow a better of their
own, as they shall see cause. The Addi|tion
of <HI>Parallel Stories</HI> is both pleasing
and edifying: Had my reading and re|membrance
of things been greater, I
might have done more that way, as I
<PB REF="11">
hope others will in the next <HI>Essay.</HI></P>
<P>I could have mentioned some very me|morable
Passages of Divine Providence,
wherein the Countrey in general hath
been concerned. Some <HI>Remarkables</HI> of
that kind are to be seen in my former
Relations of the Troubles occasioned by
the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI> There are
other particulars no less worthy to be
Recorded, but in my judgement, this is
not so proper a season for us to divulge
them. It has been in my thoughts to
publish a Discourse of <HI>Miscellaneous obser|vations,
concerning things rare and wonder|ful;
both as to the works of Creation and
Providence;</HI> which in my small Readings
I have met with in many Authors: But
this must suffice for the present. I have
often wished, that the <HI>Natural History</HI> of
<HI>New-England,</HI> might be written and pub|lished
to the World; the Rules and me|thod
described by that Learned and ex|cellent
person <HI>Robert Boyle</HI> Esq. being
duely observed therein. It would best
become some Scholar that has been born
<PB REF="11">
in this Land, to do such a service for his
Countrey. Nor would I my self decline
to put my hand (so far as my small ca|pacity
will reach) to so noble an under|taking,
did not manifold diversions and
employments prevent me from atten|ding
that which I should account a pro|fitable
Recreation. I have other work up|on
me, which I would gladly finish be|fore
I leave the World, and but a very
little time to do it in: Moreover, not ma|ny
years ago, I <HI>lost</HI> (and that's an affli|ctive
<HI>loss</HI> indeed!) several Moneths from
study by sickness. Let every God-fearing
Reader, joyn with me in Prayer,
that I may be enabled to redeem the
time, and (in all wayes wherein I am
capable) to serve my Generation.</P>

THe Royal Pen of the Prophet <HI>Da|vid</HI>
hath most truly affirmed, that
they who go down to the Sea in
Ships, that do business in great
waters, see the works of the Lord, and his
wonders in the deep. And in special, they
see wonders of Divine goodness in respect of
eminent Deliverances wrought by the hand
of the most High, who stills the noise of the
Seas, the noise of their waves. It is meet
that such Providences should be ever had in
remembrance, as most of all by the persons
concerned in them, so by others, that the God
of Salvation, who is the confidence of them
that are afar off upon the Sea, may have eter|nal
praise. Many remarkable Stories of this
kind, are to be seen in Books already publi|shed.

Mr. <HI>Anthony Thacher</HI> did Experience at his
first coming to <HI>New-England.</HI> A full and
<PB N="3" REF="13">
true Relation whereof, I find in a Letter di|rected
to his Brother Mr. <HI>Peter Thacher,</HI> then
a Faithful Minister of Christ in <HI>Sarum</HI> in
<HI>England</HI> (he was Father to my worthy dear
Friend Mr. <HI>Thomas Thacher</HI> late Pastor of one
of the Churches in this <HI>Boston.)</HI> This Letter
of Mr. <HI>Anthony Thacher</HI>'s to his Brother be|ing
written within a few dayes after that
eminent Providence hapned unto him, mat|ters
were then fresh in his memory; I shall
therefore here insert his Narrative in his own
words; who expresseth himself as followeth&punc;</P>
<Q><P>I must turn my drowned Pen and shaking
Hand to Indite the Story of such sad News
as never before this hapned in <HI>New-England.</HI>
There was a League of perpetual Friend|ship
between my Cousin <HI>Avery</HI> (note
that this Mr. <HI>Avery</HI> was a precious holy Mi|nister
who came out of <HI>England</HI> with Mr.
<HI>Anthony Thacher)</HI> and my self never to for|sake
each other to the Death, but to be par|takers
of each others misery or welfare,
as also of habitation in the same place.
Now upon our Arrival in <HI>New-England,</HI>
there was an offer made unto us. My cousin
<HI>Avery</HI> was invited to <HI>Marble-head</HI> to be their
Pastor in due time; there being no Church
planted there as yet, but a Town appointed
<PB N="4" REF="14">
to set up the Trade of Fishing. Because
many there (the most being Fishermen)
were something loose and remiss in their be|haviour;
my Cousin <HI>Avery</HI> was unwilling
to go thither, and so refusing we went to
<HI>Newbery,</HI> intending there to sit down. But
being solicited so often both by the Men of
the place, and by the Magistrates, and by
Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> and most of the Ministers, who
alledged what a benefit we might be to the
People there, and also to the Countrey and
Common-wealth; at length we embraced it,
and thither consented to go. They of
<HI>Marble-head</HI> forthwith sent a Pinnace for us
and our Goods. We Embarqued at <HI>Ipswich,
August</HI> 11. 1635. with our Families and Sub|stance,
bound for <HI>Marble-head,</HI> we being in
all twenty three Souls, <HI>viz.</HI> eleven in my
Cousin's Family, seven in mine, and one
Mr. <HI>William Eliot</HI> sometimes of <HI>New Sarum,</HI>
and four Mariners. The next morning ha|ving
commended our selves to God, with
chearful hearts, we hoised Sail; but the
Lord suddenly turned our chearfulness into
mourning and lamentations. For on the
fourteenth of this <HI>August</HI> 1635. about ten
at night, having a fresh Gale of wind, our
Sails being old and done were split. The
Mariners because that it was night, would
<PB N="5" REF="14">
not put to new Sails, but resolved to cast
Anchor till the Morning. But before day-light,
it pleased the Lord to send so mighty
a Storm, as the like was never known in
<HI>New-England</HI> since the <HI>English</HI> came, nor in
the memory of any of the <HI>Indians.</HI> It was
so furious that our Anchor came home.
Whereupon the Mariners let out more Ca|ble,
which at last slipt away. Then our
Sailers knew not what to do, but we were
driven before the wind and waves. My
Cousin and I perceived our danger, solemn|ly
recommended our selves to God the
Lord both of Earth and Seas, expecting
with every wave to be swallowed up and
drenched in the Deeps. And as my Cousin,
his Wife, and my tender Babes sat comfort|ing
and chearing one the other in the Lord
against ghastly Death, which every moment
stared us in the face, and sat triumphing
upon each ones Forehead, we were by the
violence of the Waves and fury of the winds,
(by the Lords permission) lifted up upon a
Rock between two high Rocks, yet all was
one Rock, but it raged with the stroke
which came into the Pinnace, so as we were
presently up to our middles in water as we
sat. The Waves came furiously and violent|ly
over us, and against us, but by reason of
<PB N="6" REF="15">
the Rocks proportion could not lift us off,
but beat her all to pieces. Now look with
me upon our distress, and consider of my
misery, who beheld the Ship broken, the wa|ter
in her, and violently overwhelming us,
my Goods, and Provisions swimming in the
Seas, my Friends almost drowned, and mine
own poor Children so untimely (if I may
so term it without offence) before mine
eyes drowned, and ready to be swallowed up
and dashed to pieces against the Rocks by
the merciless waves, and my self ready to ac|company
them. But I must go on to an
end of this woful Relation. In the same
room whereas he sat, the Master of the Pin|nace
not knowing what to do, our fore-Mast
was cut down, our main-Mast broken
in three pieces, the fore part of the Pinnace
beat away, our Goods swimming about the
Seas, my Children bewailing me, as not pit|tying
themselves, and my self bemoaning
them; poor Souls, whom I had occasioned
to such an end in their tender years, whenas
they could scarce be sensible of death. And
so likewise my Cousin, his Wife, and his,
Children, and both of us bewailing each o|ther,
in our Lord and only Saviour Jesus
Christ, in whom only we had comfort and
cheerfulness, insomuch that from the greatest
<PB N="7" REF="15">
to the least of us, there was not one scri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
or out-cry made, but all as silent sheep were
contentedly resolved to die together loving|ly,
as since our acquaintance we had lived
together friendly. Now as I was sitting in
the Cabbin room-door with my body in the
room, when lo one of the Sailers by a wave
being washed out of the Pinnace was got|ten
in again, and coming into the Cabbin
room over my back, cried out, we are all
cast away, the Lord have mercy upon us, I
have been washed over-board into the Sea,
and am gotten in again. His speeches made
me look forth. And looking towards the
Sea, and seeing how we were, I turned my
self to my Cousin and the rest, and spake
these words, Oh Cousin, it hath pleased God
to cast us here between two Rocks, the
shoar not far off from us, for I saw the tops
of Trees when I looked forth. Whereupon
the Master of the Pinnace looking up at the
Scuttle hole of the quarter Deck, went out
at it, but I never saw him afterwards. Then
he that had been in the Sea, went out again
by me, and leapt overboard towards the
Rocks, whom afterwards also I could not
see. Now none were left in the Barque
that I knew or saw, but my Cousin, his Wife
and Children, my self and mine, and his
<PB N="8" REF="16">
maid-servant. But my Cousin thought I
would have fled from him, and said unto
me, Oh Cousin leave us not, let us die to|together,
and reached forth his hand unto
me. Then I letting go my Son <HI>Peter</HI>'s hand
took him by the hand, and said, Cousin, I
purpose it not, whithe shall I go? I am wil|ling
and ready here to die with you and my
poor Children. God be merciful to us, and
receive us to himself, adding these words,
the Lord is able to help and deliver us. He
replied, saying, truth Cousin, but what his
pleasure is we know not; I fear we have
been too unthankful for former deliveran|ces,
but he hath promised to deliver us from
sin and condemnation, and to bring us safe
to heaven through the alsufficient satisfaction
of Jesus Christ, <HI>this therefore we may challenge
of him.</HI> To which I replying said, that is all
the deliverance I now desire and expect.
Which words I had no sooner spoken, but
by a mighty wave I was with the piece of the
Barque washed out upon part of the Rock,
where the wave left me almost drowned, but
recovering my feet I saw above me on the
Rock my Daughter <HI>Mary,</HI> to whom I had
no sooner gotten, but my Cousin <HI>Avery,</HI> and
his eldest Son came to us, being all four of
us washed out by one and the same Wave, we
<PB N="9" REF="16">
went all into a small hole on the top of the
Rock, whence we called to those in the Pin|nace
to come unto us, supposing we had been
in more safety than they were in. My Wife
seeing us there was crept up into the scuttle
of the Quarter Deck to come unto us, but
presently came another wave and dashing
the Pinnace all to pieces, carried my
Wife away in the Scuttle, as she was, with the
greater part of the quarter Deck unto the
Shoar; where she was cast safely, but her
Legs were something bruised, and much
Timber of the Vessel being there also cast,
she was sometime before she could get away
being washed by the Waves. All the rest
that were in the Barque were drowned in
the merciless Seas. We four by that wave
were clean swept away from off the Rock
also, into the Sea; the Lord in one instant
of time disposing of fifteen Souls of us, ac|cording
to his good pleasure and will, His
pleasure and wonderful great mercy to
me was thus. Standing on the Rock as be|fore
you heard, with my eldest Daughter,
my Cousin and his eldest Son, looking upon,
and talking to them in the Barque, whenas
we were by that merciless wave washed off
the Rock, as before you heard. God in his
mercy caused me to fall by the stroke of the
<PB N="10" REF="17">
wave flat on my face, for my face was to|ward
the Sea, insomuch that as I was sli|ding
off the Rock into the Sea, the Lord
directed my toes into a joynt in the Rocks
side, as also the tops of some of my fingers
with my right hand, by means whereof,
the wave leaving me, I remained so, ha|ving
in the Rock only my head above the
water. When on the left hand I espied a
Board or Plank of the Pinnace. And as I
was reaching out my left hand to lay hold on
it, by another coming over the top of the
Rock, I was washed away from the Rock,
and by the violence of the waves was dri|ven
hither and thither in the Seas a great
while, and had many dashes against the
Rocks. At length past hopes of Life, and
wearied in body and spirits, I even gave over
to nature, and being ready to receive in
the waters of Death, I lifted up both my
heart and hands to the God of Heaven.
For note, I had my senses remaining per|fect
with me all the time that I was under
and in water, who at that instant lifted my
head above the top of the water, that so I
might breathe without any hindrance by
the waters. I stood bolt upright as if I had
stood upon my feet, but I felt no bottom,
nor had any footing for to stand upon, but
<PB N="11" REF="17">
the waters. While I was thus above the wa|ter,
I saw by me a piece of the Mast, as I
suppose about three foot long, which I la|boured
to catch into my arms. But sudden|ly
I was overwhelmed with water, and dri|ven
to and fro again, and at last I felt the
ground with my right foot. When imme|diately
whilest I was thus groveling on my
face, I presently recovering my feet, was in
the water up to my Breast, and through
Gods great mercy had my face unto the
shoar, and not to the Sea. I made hast to
get out, but was thrown down on my hands
with the waves, and so with safety crept to
the dry shoar. Where blessing God, I turned
about to look for my Children and Friends,
but saw neither, nor any part of the Pin|nace,
where I left them as I supposed. But
I saw my Wife about a Butt length from me
getting her self forth from amongst the
Timber of the broken Barque: but before
I could get unto her, she was gotten to the
shoar: I was in the water after I was wash|ed
from the Rock, before I came to the
shoar a quarter of an hour at least. When
we were come each to other, we went and
sat under the Bank. But fear of the Seas
roaring and our coldness would not suffer
us there to remain. But we went up into
<PB N="12" REF="18">
the Land and sat us down under a Cedar
Tree which the wind had thrown down,
where we sat about an hour almost dead
with cold. But now the Storm was broken
up, and the wind was calm, but the Sea re|mained
rough and fearful to us. My Legs
were much bruised, and so was my head, o|ther
hurt had I none, neither had I taken in
much quantity of water: but my heart
would not let me sit still any longer, but I
vvould go to see if any more were gotten to
the Land in safety, especially hoping to
have met with some of my own poor Chil|dren,
but I could find none, neither dead
nor yet living. You condole with me my
miseries, who now began to consider of my
losses. Now came to my remembrance the
time and manner, how and when I last saw
and left my Children and Friends. One
was severed from me sitting on the Rock at
my feet, the other three in the Pinnace: my
little Babe (Ah poor <HI>Peter)</HI> sitting in his
Sister <HI>Ediths</HI> arms, who to the uttermost of
her power sheltred him from the waters,
my poor <HI>William</HI> standing close unto them,
all three of them lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">king ruefully on me on
the Rock; their very Countenances calling
unto me to help them, whom I could not go
unto, neither could they come at me, nei|ther
<PB N="13" REF="18">
would the merciless waves afford me
space or time to use any means at all, either
to help them or my self. Oh I yet see their
cheeks, poor silent Lambs, pleading pity
and help at my hands. Then on the other
side to consider the loss of my dear Friends,
with the spoiling and loss of all our Goods
and Provisions, my self cast upon an un|known
Land, in a Wilderness, I knew not
where, nor how to get thence. Then it
came to my mind how I had occasioned the
Death of my Children, who caused them
to leave their native Land, who might have
left them there, yea, and might have sent
some of them back again and cost me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o|thing:
these and such like thoughts do press
down my heavy heart very much. But I
must let this pass, and will proceed on in the
Relation of Gods goodness unto me in that
desolate Island, on which I was cast. I and
my Wife were almost naked both of us, and
wet and cold even unto death,. I found a
Snapsack cast on the shoar, in which I had
a Steel and Flint and Powder-horn. Going
further I found a drowned Goat, then I
found a Hat, and my Son <HI>William</HI>'s Coat,
both which I put on. My Wife found one
of her Petticoats which she put on. I found
also two Cheeses and some Butter driven
<PB N="14" REF="19">
ashoar. Thus the Lord sent us some clothes
to put on, and food to sustain our new lives
which we had lately given unto us; and
means also to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, for in an Horn I
had some Gun-powder, which to mine ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
(and since to other mens) admiration was
dry. So taking a piece of my Wives Neck|cloth,
which I dried in the Sun, I struck fire,
and so dried and warmed our wet Bodies,
and then skinned the Goat, and having
found a small Brass-pot, we boyled some of
her. Our Drink was brackish water; Bread
we had none. There we remained until
the Monday following, When about three
of the Clock in the afternoon, in a Boat
that came that way, we went off that deso|late
Island; which I named after my name,
<HI>Thachers Woe,</HI> and the Rock <HI>Avery his fall:</HI>
to the end that their fall and loss, and mine
own might be had in perpetual remem|brance.
In the Isle lieth buried the body of
my Cousins eldest Daughter, whom I found
dead on the shoar. On the Tuesday follow|ing
in the afternoon we arrived at <HI>Marble-Head.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Thus far is Mr. <HI>Thachers</HI> Relation
of this memorable Providence.</P>
<P>We proceed to some other:</P>
<P>Remarkable was that deliverance menti|oned
<PB N="15" REF="19">
both by Mr. <HI>Ianeway,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burton,</HI>
wherein that gallant Commander Major <HI>Ed|ward
Gibbons</HI> of <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and
others were concerned. The substance of
the Story is this. A <HI>New-England</HI> Vessel go|ing
from <HI>Boston</HI> to some other parts of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>
was through the continuance of contra|ry
winds, kept long at Sea, so that they were
in very great straits for want of Provision,
and seeing they could not hope for any re|lief
from Earth or Sea, they apply themselves
to Heaven in humble and hearty Prayers, but
no Calm ensuing, one of them made this
sorrowful motion, that they should cast Lots,
which of them should die first, to satisfie th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
ravenous Hunger of the rest. After many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
sad Debate, they come to a result, the Lot is
cast, and one of the company is taken, but
where is the Executioner to be found to act
this Office upon a poor Innocent? It is death
now to think who shall act this bloody part
in the Tragedy: But before they fall upon
this in-voluntary Execution, they once more
went unto their Prayers, and while they were
calling upon God, he answered them, for
there leapt a mighty Fish into the Boat, which
was a double joy to them, not only in re|lieving
their miserable hunger, which no
doubt made them quick Cooks, but because
<PB N="16" REF="20">
they looked upon it to be sent from God, and
to be a token of their Deliverance. But
Alas! the Fish is soon eaten, and their for|mer
Exigencies come upon them, which sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
their spirits into despair; for they know no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of another Morsel. To Lot they go again
the second time, which falleth upon another
person; but still none can be found to Sacri|fice
him; they again send their Prayers to
Heaven with all manner of fervency, when
behold a second Answer from above! a great
Bird lights, and fixes it self upon the Mast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
which one of the Company espies, and he
goes, and there she stands, till he took her
with his hand by the wing. This was life
from the dead the second time, and they feast|ed
themselves herewith, as hoping that se|cond
Providence was a fore-runner of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r
compleat Deliverance. But they have still
the same Disappointments, they can see no
Land, they know not where they are. Hun|ger
encreaseth again upon them, and they
have no hopes to be saved but by a third Mi|racle.
They are reduced to the former course
of casting Lots, when they were going to
the heart-breaking work, to put him to death
whom the Lot fell upon, they go to God
their former Friend in adversity, by humbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
and hearty Prayers; and now they look an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="17" REF="20">
look again; but there is nothing: Their
prayers are concluded, and nothing appears,
yet still they hoped and stayed; till at last
one of them espies a Ship, which put new
life into all their spirits. They bear up with
their Vessel, they Man their Boat, and desire
and beg like perishing, humble Supplicants to
Board them, which they are admitted. The
Vessel proves a <HI>French</HI> Vessel, yea, a <HI>French
Pirate.</HI> Major <HI>Gibbons</HI> petitions them for a
little Bread, and offers Ship and Cargo for it.
But the Commander knows the Major, (from
whom he had received some signal kindnesses
formerly at <HI>Boston)</HI> and replied readily,
and chearfully, Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> not a hair of
you or your Company shall perish, if it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in
my power to preserve you. And according|ly
he relieveth them, and sets them safe on
shoar.</P>
<P>Memorable also is that which Mr. <HI>Iane|way</HI>
in his Remarkable Sea-Deliverances, <HI>P.</HI>
35. hath published. He there relates that in
the Year 1668. a Ketch whereof <HI>Thomas
Woodbery</HI> was Master, Sailing from <HI>New-En|gland</HI>
for <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> when they came in the
Latitude of 35. <HI>gr.</HI> because there was some
appearance of foul-weather, they lowred
their Sails, sending up one to the top of the
<PB N="18" REF="21">
Mast, he thought he saw something like a
Boat floating upon the Sea, and calling to the
Men below, they made towards it, and when
they came near, it appeared to be a Long-Boat
with eleven Men in it, who had been
bound for <HI>Virginia;</HI> but their Ship proved
leaky, and Foundred in the Sea; so that they
were forced suddenly to betake themselves to
their Long-Boat; in the which they had a
Capstone Bar, which they made use of for a
Mast, and a piece of Canvas for a Sail, so
did they Sail before the Wind. But they ha|ving
no Victuals with them, were soon in mi|serable
distress. Thus they continued five
dayes, so that all despaired of Life. Upon
the sixth day they concluded to cast Lots for
their lives, <HI>viz.</HI> who should die that the rest
might eat him, and have their lives preserved.
He that the Lot fell upon, begged for his
Life a little longer; and being in their extre|mity,
the Wonder-working Providence of
God was seen: for they meet with this <HI>New-England</HI>
Vessel, which took them in, and sa|ved
their lives. An hour after this a terrible
Storm arose, continuing forty hours, so that
if they had not met the Vessel that saved the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
in the nick of opportunity, they had all pe|rished:
and if the <HI>New-England</HI> Men ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
not taken down some of their Sails, or ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="19" REF="21">
not chanced to send one up to Tallow the
Mast, this Boat and Men had never been seen
by them. Thus admirable are the workings
of divine providence in the World.</P>
<P>Yet further;</P>
<P>That Worthy and now blessed Minister of
God Mr. <HI>Iames Ianeway,</HI> hath published se|veral
other Remarkable Sea-Deliverances;
of which some belonging to <HI>New-England</HI>
were the Subjects. He relates (and I am
informed that it was really so) that a small
Vessel (the Masters Name <HI>Philip Hungare)</HI>
coming upon the Coast of <HI>New-England</HI>
suddenly sprang a Leak, and so Foundered.
In the Vessel there were eighteen Souls,
twelve of which got into the Long Boat.
They threw into the Boat some small mat|ters
of Provision, but were wholly without
fire. These twelve Men sailed five hundred
Leagues in this small Boat, being by almost
miraculous Providences preserved therein for
five weeks together. God sent relief to them
by causing some flying Fish to fall into the
Boat, which they eat raw, and were well
pleased therewith. They also caught a Shark
and opening his belly, sucked his blood for
drink. At the last the divine providence
brought them to the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> Some of
them were so weak as that they soon died&punc;
<PB N="20" REF="22">
but most of them lived to declare the Works
of the Lord.</P>
<P>Again he Relates that Mr. <HI>Ionas Clark</HI> of
<HI>New-England</HI> going for <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Vessel
was cast ashoar in the night. They hoped
to get their Ship off again; to which end the
Master with some others going in the Boat,
when they were about sixty Fathom from the
Shoar, there arose a great Sea which broke in
upon them, and at last turned the Boat over.
Four Men were drowned. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> was
held under water till his Breath was gone, yet
(through the good hand of a gracious God)
he was set at liberty, and was enabled to swim
to the shoar, where the providence of God
did so over-rule the hearts of <HI>Barbarians,</HI> as
that they did them no hurt, until at last they
were brought safe unto the <HI>English Plantati|ons.</HI>
These things have (as was said) been
related by Mr. <HI>Ianeway.</HI> I proceed there|fore
to mention some other Sea-Deliverances.
And that notable preservation deserves to be
here Inserted and Recorded; Wherein Mr.
<HI>Iohn Grafton</HI> and some others of his Ships
Company were concerned; who as they were
bound in a Voyage from <HI>Salem</HI> in <HI>New-En|gland,</HI>
for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> in a Ketch called
the <HI>Providence;</HI> (on <HI>September</HI> 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1669.)
<PB N="21" REF="22">
their Vessel suddenly struck upon a Rock; at
the which they were amazed, it being then a
dark and rainy night; the force of the wind
and Sea broke their Vessel in a moment.
Their Company was ten Men in number,
whereof six were drowned. The Master
and the Mate were left upon the Rock. As
they sat there, the Sea came up to their wasts.
There did they embrace each other, looking
for Death every moment; and if the Tide
had risen higher it would have carried them
off. By the same Rock was one of the Sea-men,
being much wounded and grievously
groaning. In the Morning they saw an
Island about half a mile off from them. The
Rocks were so sharp and cragged that they
could not tread upon them with their bare
feet, nor had they Shoes or Stockins. But
they found a piece of Tarpoling, which they
wrapped about their feet, making it fast with
Rope-yarns; so getting each of them a stick,
they sometimes went on their feet, and some|times
crept, until at last they came to the
Island, where they found another of their
Company ashoar, being carried thither by a
piece of the Vessel. Upon the Island they
continued eight dayes, four of which they
had no fire. Their Provision was salt Fish
and Rain Water, which they found in the
<PB N="22" REF="23">
holes of the Rocks. After four dayes they
found a piece of Touch-wood, which the
Mate had formerly in his Chest, and a piece
of Flint, with which having a small Knife
they struck fire. A Barrel of Flower being
cast on shoar they made Cakes thereof. Now
their care was how to get off from the Island,
there being no Inhabitants there. Finding a
piece of the Main-sail, and some hoops of
Cask they framed a Boat therewith. Yet
had they no Tools to build it with. But pro|vidence
so ordered, that they found a Board
twelve foot long, and some Nails; also a Box
was cast ashoar wherein was a Bolt-rope
Needle; they likewise found a Tar-Barrel,
wherewith they Tarred their Canvas. Thus
did they patch up a Boat in fashion like a
Birchen Canoo; and meeting with some thin
Boards of Sieling which came out of the
Cabbin, they made Paddles therewith, so did
they venture in this dangerous Vessel ten
Leagues, until they came to <HI>Anguilla,</HI> and
St. <HI>Martins,</HI> where they were courteously en|tertained,
the People admiring how they
could come so many Leagues in such a
strange kind of Boat. Besides all these par|ticulars,
which have been declared, Informa|tion
is brought to me concerning some Sea-preservations
which have hapned more lately.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">
There was a small Vessel set Sail from
<HI>Bristol</HI> to <HI>New-England,</HI> Sept. 22. 1681. The
Masters Name <HI>William Dutten.</HI> There were
seven Men in the Vessel, having on Board
Provision for three Moneths, but by reason
of contrary Winds, they were twenty Weeks
before they could make any Land; and some
unhappy Accidents fell out which occasioned
their being put to miserable straits for victu|als,
but most of all for Drink. The Winds
were fair and prosperous until <HI>October</HI> 28.
when they supposed themselves to be gotten
600 Leagues Westward. But after that the
No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> west Winds blew so fiercely, that they
were driven off from the Coast of <HI>New-En|gland,</HI>
so that <HI>December</HI> 12. they concluded to
bear away for <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> But before this,
one of their Barrels of Beer had the head
broken out, and the Liquor in it lost. They
had but seven Barrels of Water, three of
which proved leaky, so that the Water in
them was lost. When their Victuals failed,
the Providence of God sent them a supply
by causing <HI>Dolphins</HI> to come near to the Ves|sel,
and that still as their wants were greatest,
nor could they catch more than would serve
their present turn. But still their misery upon
them was great, through their want of Wa|ter.
Sometimes they would expose their Ves|sels
<PB N="24" REF="24">
to take the Rain-water, but oft when it
Rained the Winds were so furious, that they
could save little or no Rain, yet so it fell out
that when they came near to the Latitude of
<HI>Barmudas</HI> they saved two Barrels of Rain-Water,
which caused no little joy amongst
them. But the Rats did unexpectedly, eat
holes through the Barrels, so that their water
was lost again. Once when a shower of
Rain fell they could save but a pint, which
though it was made bitter by the Tar, it
seemed very sweet to them. They divided
this pint of Rain-Water amongst seven, drink|ing
a thimble full at a time, which went five
times about and was a great refreshing to
them. On <HI>Ianuary</HI> 27. a good shower of
Rain fell; that so they might be sure to save
some Water, and not be again deprived there|of
by the Rats; they layed their Shirts open
to the Rain, and wringing them dry, they ob|tained
seven Gallons of Water, which they
put into Bottles, and were for a time much
refreshed thereby. But new straits come
upon them. They endeavoured to catch the
Rats in the Vessel, and could take but three
or four, which they did eat, and it seemed de|licate
meat to their hungry Souls. But the
Torment of their Drought was insufferable.
Sometimes for a Week together they had not
<PB N="25" REF="24">
one drop of fresh water. When they killed
a <HI>Dolphin</HI> they would open his Belly and suck
his blood a little to relieve their thirst. Yea,
their thirst was so great that they fell to drink|ing
of salt-water. Some drank several Gal|lons,
but they found that it did not allay their
thirst. They greedily drank their own
Urine when they could make any. They
would go over-board with a Rope fastned to
their bodies, and put themselves into the wa|ter,
hoping to find some refreshment thereby.
When any of them stood to steer the Vessel&punc;
he would think a little to refresh himself by
having his feet in a pail of Sea-Water. In
this misery some of the Sea-men confessed
that it was just with God thus to afflict them&punc;
in that they had been guilty of wasting good
drink, and of abusing themselves therewith
before they came to Sea. The divine Pro|vidence
so ordered, that on <HI>February</HI> 7, they
met with a Vessel at Sea, which hapned to be
a <HI>Guiny</HI> Man <HI>(Samuel Ricard</HI> Master) their
Boat was become leaky, that they could not
go aboard, if it had been to save their lives.
But the Master of the other Vessel under|standing
how it was with them, very courte|ously
sent his own Boat to them, with ten
pieces of <HI>Guiny</HI> Beef, two ankors of fresh wa|ter,
and four bushels of <HI>Guiny</HI> Corn, whereby
<PB N="26" REF="25">
they were sustained until they arrived at <HI>Bar|badoes;</HI>
being weak and spent with their hard|ships,
but within a fortnight they were all re|covered,
and came the next Summer to <HI>New-England.</HI>
This Account I received from the
Mate of the Vessel, whose Name is <HI>Ioseph
Butcher.</HI></P>
<P>Remarkable also, is the preservation of
which some belonging to <HI>Dublin</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI>
had Experience; whom a <HI>New-England</HI> Vessel
providentially met, in an open Boat, in the
wide Sea, and saved them from perishing.
Concerning which memorable Providence, I
have received the following Narrative: A
Ship of <HI>Dublin</HI> burdened about seventy Tuns
<HI>Andrew Bennet</HI> Master, being bound from
<HI>Dublin</HI> to <HI>Virginia;</HI> this Vessel having been
some Weeks at Sea, onward of their Voyage,
and being in the Latitude of 39. about 150
Leagues distant from Cape Cod in <HI>New-En|gland,</HI>
on <HI>April</HI> 18. 1681. a day of very stor|my
Weather, and a great Sea, suddenly there
sprang a Plank in the fore part of the Ship,
about six a Clock in the morning: where|upon
the Water increased so fast in the Ship,
that all their endeavours could not keep her
from sinking above half an hour: so when
the Ship was just sinking, some of the Com|pany
<PB N="27" REF="25">
resolved to lanch out the Boat, which
was a small one. They did accordingly, and
the Master, the Mate, the Boat-swain, the
Cook, two Fore-mast-men and a Boy, kept
such hold of it, when a Cast of the Sea sud|denly
helped them off with it, that they got
into it. The heaving of the Sea now sudden|ly
thrust them from the Ship, in which there
were left nineteen Souls, <HI>viz.</HI> 16 Men and
three Women; who all perished in the migh|ty
Waters, while they were trying to make
Rafters by cutting down the Masts, for the
preservation of their lives, as long as might
be. The seven in the Boat apprehended
themselves to be in a condition little better
then that of them in the Ship, having neither
Sails nor Oars, neither Bread nor Water, and
no Instrument of any sort, except a Knife
and a piece of Deal-board, with which they
made sticks, and set them up in the sides of
the Boat, and covered them with some <HI>Irish-Cloth</HI>
of their own Garments, to keep off the
spray of the Sea, as much as could be by so
poor a matter. In this condition they drave
with an hard Wind and high Sea all that day,
and the night following. But in the next
morning about six a Clock, they saw a Ketch
(the Master whereof was Mr. <HI>Edmund Hen|field</HI>
of <HI>Salem</HI> in <HI>New-England)</HI> under Sail&punc;
<PB N="28" REF="26">
which Ketch coming right with them, took
them up and brought them safe to <HI>New-En|gland.</HI>
And it is yet further remarkable, that
when the Ship Foundred, the Ketch which
saved these persons was many Leagues to the
Westward of her, but was by a contrary
Wind caused to stand back again to the East|ward
where these distressed persons were (as
hath been said) met with, and relieved.</P>
<P>Another Remarkable Sea-Deliverance,
like unto this last mentioned, hapned this pre|sent
year; the Relation whereof take as fol|loweth.
A Ship called the <HI>Swallow, Thomas
Welden</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Master; on their Voyage
from St. <HI>Christophers</HI> towards <HI>London,</HI> did on
<HI>March</HI> 23. last (being then about the Latitude
of 42.) meet with a violent Storm. That
Storm somewhat allayed, the Ship lying in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rough of the Sea, her Rudder broke away.
Whereupon the Mariners veered out a Cable,
and part of a Mast to steer by; but that not
answering their expectation, they took an
Hogs-head of Water, and fastned it to the
Cable to steer the Ship; that also failing, they
laid the Ship by: (as the Sea-mens phrase is)
And on <HI>March</HI> 25. an exceeding great Storm
arose, which made the Vessel ly down with
her Hatches under Water, in which conditi|on
<PB N="29" REF="26">
she continued about two hours, and having
much Water in the Hold, they found no o|ther
way to make her rise again, but by cutting
down her Masts, and accordingly her Main|mast
and her Mizen-mast being cut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">down,
the Ship righted again. The Storm continu|ing,
on <HI>March</HI> 28. the Ship made very bad
Steeridge, by reason of the loss of her Rudder
and Masts, The Sea had continual passage
over her, and one Sea did then carry away
the Larbord quarter of the Ship, and brake
the side from the Deck, so that there was an
open passage for the Sea to come in at that
Breach; and notwithstanding their endea|vours
to stop it with their Bedding, Cloathes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> so much Water ran in by the sides of the
Ship, that it was ready to sink. Now all hopes
of saving their lives being gone; the Divine
Providence so ordered, that there appeared a
Vessel within sight, which hapned to be a
<HI>French</HI> Ship bound from St. <HI>Iohn de luce</HI> to
Grand <HI>Placentia</HI> in <HI>New-found Land;</HI> this
Vessel took in the distressed <HI>English-men,</HI> car|ried
them to Grand <HI>Placentia,</HI> from whence
the Master and sundry of the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">iners pro|cured
passage in a Ketch bound for <HI>Boston</HI> in
<HI>New-England.</HI> There did they arrive <HI>Iune</HI>
21. 1683. declaring how they had seen the
wonders of God in the deep&punc; as hath been ex|pressed.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="27">
There was another memorable Sea-Deli|verance
like unto these two last. The per|sons
concerned in it being now gone out of
the World, I have not met with any who per|fectly
remember the particular year wherein
that remarkable Providence hapned; only
that it was about twenty two years ago: when
a Ship <HI>(William Laiton</HI> Master) bound from
<HI>Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">taqua</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> be|ing
250 Leagues off from the Coast, sprang
a leak. They endeavoured what they could
to clear her with their Pump for fourteen
hours. But the Vessel filling with Water,
they were forced (being eight persons) to be|take
themselves to their Boat, taking with
them a good supply of Bread, and a pot of
Butter. The Master declaring that he was
perswaded they should meet with a Ship at
Sea that would relieve them: but they had
little Water, so that their allowance was at last
a spoonful in a Day to each man. In this
Boat did they continue thus distressed for 19
dayes together. After they had been twelve
dayes from the Vessel, they met with a Storm
which did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ery much endanger their lives, yet
God preserved them. At the end of eigh|teen
dayes a flying Fish fell into their Boat,
and having with them an Hook and Line,
they made use of that Fish for Bait, whereby
<PB N="31" REF="27">
they caught two Dolphins. A Ship then at
Sea, whereof Mr. <HI>Samuel Scarlet</HI> was Com|mander,
apprehending a Storm to be near,
that so they might fit their Rigging in order
to entertain the approaching Storm, suffered
their Vessel to drive right before the Wind;
and by that means they hapned to meet with
this Boat full of distressed Sea-men. Cap|tain
<HI>Scarlet</HI>'s Vessel was then destitute of Pro|vision;
only they had on board Water e|nough
and to spare. When the Mariners
first saw the Boat, they desired the Master not
to take the Men in, because they had no Bread
nor other Victuals for them; so that by re|ceiving
eight more into their Company, they
should all die with Famine. Captain <HI>Scarlet</HI>
who as after he left using the Sea, he gave ma|ny
demonstrations both living and dying of
his designing the good of others, and not his
own particular Advantage only, did at this
time manifest the same Spirit to be in him;
and therefore would by no means hearken to
the selfish suggestions of his Men, but repli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
to them, (as vet not knowing who they were)
It may be these distressed Creatures are our
own Countrey-men, or if no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, they are Men
in misery, and therefore what ever come of it,
I am resolved to take them in, and to trust in
God who is able to deliver us all. Nor did
<PB N="32" REF="28">
God suffer him to lose any thing by this No|ble
Resolution. For as in Captain <HI>Scarlet</HI>'s
Ship there was Water which the Men in the
Boat wanted, so they in the Boat had Bread
and the two <HI>Dolphins</HI> lately caught, whereby
all the Ships Company were refreshed. And
within few dayes they all arrived safe in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEsides those notable <HI>Sea-Deliverances</HI>
which have been in the former Chapter
Related, many other memorable Providences
and Preservations have hapned. A multi|tude
of Instances to this purpose are now lost
in the Grave of Oblivion, because they were
not <HI>Recorded</HI> in the season of them. But
<PB N="33" REF="28">
such Observables as I have been by good hands
acquainted with, I shall here further Relate.</P>
<P>Remarkable was the Preservation and Re|storation
which the gracious providence of
God vouchsafed to <HI>Abigail Eliot,</HI> the Daugh|ter
of Elder <HI>Eliot</HI> of <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI>
concerning whom a near and precious Rela|tion
of hers, informs me, that when she was
a Child about five years old, playing with o|ther
Children under a Cart an iron hinge be|ing
sharp at the lower end hapned to strike
her head between the right Ear and the
Crown of her Head, and pierced into the
skull and Brain. The Child making an out|cry,
the Mother came; and immediately
drew out the Iron, and thereupon some of
the Brains of her Child which stuck to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Iron, and other bits were scattered on her
Forehead. Able Chyrurgeons were sent for;
in special Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> and Mr. <HI>Prat.</HI> The
Head being uncovered, there appeared just
upon the place where the Iron pierced the
Skull, a bunch as big as a small Egg. A que|stion
arose, whether the skin should not be
cut and dilated from the Orifice of the Wound
to the Swelling, and so take it away. This
Mr. <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> inclined unto, but Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> op|posed,
pleading that then the Air would get
to the Brain, and the Child would presently
<PB N="34" REF="29">
die. Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> was desired to undertake the
Cure. And thus was his operation. He
gently drove the soft matter of the bunch in|to
the Wound, and pressed so much out as
well he could; there came forth about a
spoonful, the matter which came forth was
Brains and Blood (some curdles of Brain
were white and not stained with Blood) so
did he apply a Plaister. The Skull wasted
where it was pierced to the bigness of an half
Crown piece of Silver or more. The skin
was exceeding tender, so that a Silver Plate
like the skull was alwayes kept in the place to
defend it from any touch or injury. The
Brains of the Child did swell and swage ac|cording
to the Tides. When it was Spring
Tide, her Brain would heave up the tender
skin, and fill the place sometimes. When i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
it was Nip Tide, they would be sunk and
fallen within the skull. This Child lived to
be the Mother of two Children. And
(which is marvelous) she was not by this
Wound made defective in her Memory or
Understanding.</P>
<P>In the next place, we shall take notice o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
some Remarkable Preservations which sundry
in <HI>Windsor</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> have experience<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
the Persons concerned therein being desiro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="35" REF="29">
that the Lords goodness towards them may
be ever had in Remembrance: wherefore a
faithful hand has given me the following ac|count.
<HI>Ianuary</HI> 13. 1670, Three Women,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Wives of Lieut. <HI>Filer,</HI> and of <HI>Ioh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Drake,</HI> and of <HI>Nathaniel Lomas&punc;</HI> having cros|sed
<HI>Connecticut</HI> River upon a necessary and
neighbourly account, and having done the
work they went for, were desirous to return
to their own Families; the River being at
that time partly shut up with Ice old and new&punc;
and partly open. There being some pains
taken aforehand to cut a way through the
Ice, the three Women abovesaid got into a
Canoo, with whom also there was <HI>Nathaniel
Bissel,</HI> and an <HI>Indian.</HI> There was likewise
another Canoo with two men in it, that went
before them to help them in case they should
meet with any distress, which indeed quickly
came upon them; for just as they were get|ting
out of the narrow passage between the
Ice, being near the middle of the River, a
great part of the upper Ice came down upon
them, and struck the end of their Canoo,
and broke it to pieces; so that it quickly sunk
under them: the <HI>Indian</HI> speedily got upon the
Ice, but <HI>Nathaniel Bissel,</HI> and the abovesaid
Women were left floating in the Middle of
the River, being cut off from all manner of
<PB N="36" REF="30">
humane help besides what did arise from
themselves, and the two men in the little
Canoo, which was so small that three persons
durst seldom, if ever, venture in it, they were
indeed discerned from one shore, but the dan|gerous
Ice would not admit from either
shore, one to come near them. All things
thus circumstanced, the suddenness of the
stroke and distress (which is apt to amaze
men, especially when no less then life is con|cerned)
the extream coldness of the weather,
it being a sharp season, that persons out of the
water were in danger of freezing, the unapt|ness
of the persons to help themselves, being
mostly Women, one big with Child, and near
the time of her Travel (who was also carried
away under the Ice) the other as unskill'd
and unactive to do any thing for self-preser|vation
as almost any could be, the Waters deep,
that there was no hope of footing, no passage
to either shore, in any eye of reason, neither
with their little Canoo, by reason of the Ice,
nor without it, the Ice being thin and rotten,
and full of holes. Now, that all should be
brought off safely without the loss of life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
wrong to health, was counted in the day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
it a <HI>Remarkable Providence.</HI> To say, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
was done, is difficult, yet something of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
manner of the Deliverance may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="37" REF="30">
the abovesaid <HI>Nathaniel Bissel</HI> perceiving
their danger, and being active in swimming,
endeavoured what might be, the preservation
of himself, and some others, he strove to
have swum to the upper Ice, but the Stream
being too hard, he was forced downwards to
the lower Ice, where by reason of the slippe|riness
of the Ice, and disadvantage of the
Stream, he found it difficult getting up; at
length by the good hand of providence, being
gotten upon the Ice, he saw one of the Wo|men
swimming down under the Ice, and per|ceiving
an hole, or open place, some few
Rods below, there he waited, and took her
up as she swum along. The other two Wo|men
were in the River, till the two Men in
the little Canoo came for their relief; at
length all of them got their heads above the
Water, and had a little time to pause, though
a long, and difficult, and dangerous way to
any shore, but by getting their little Canoo
upon the Ice, and carrying one at a time o|ver
hazardous Places, they did (though in a
long while) get all safe to the shore, from
whence they came.</P>
<P>Remarkable also, was the Deliverance
which <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Thomas Bissel</HI> of <HI>Windsor</HI> a|foresaid,
did at another time receive. <HI>Iohn
<PB N="38" REF="31">
Bissel</HI> on a Morning about break of day ta|king
Nails out of a great Barrel wherein was
a considerable quantity of Gun-Powder, and
Bullets, having a Candle in his hand, the
Powder took fire, <HI>Thomas Bissel</HI> was then put|ting
on his clothes, standing by a Window,
which though well fastened, was by the force
of the Powder carried away at least four
Rods; the Partition-wall from another Room
was broken in pieces; The roof of the House
opened and slipt of the Plates about
five foot down; also the great Girt of the
House at one end broke out so far, that it
drew from the Summer to the end, most of
its Tenant: the Woman of the House was ly|ing
sick, and another Woman under it in bed,
yet did the divine Providence so order things
as that no one received any hurt, excepting
<HI>Iohn Bissel,</HI> who fell through two Floors into
a Cellar his shoes being taken from his feet,
and found at twenty foot distance, his hands
and his face very much scorched, without any
other wound in his body.</P>
<P>It would fill a Volume to give an account
of all the memorable Preservations in the
time of the late War with the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Remarkable was that which hapned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
<HI>Iabez Musgrove</HI> of <HI>Newbery,</HI> who being sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

by an <HI>Indian,</HI> the Bullet entred in at his Ear
and went out at his Eye, on the other side of
his Head, yet the Man was preserved from
Death, yea, and is still in the Land of the
living.</P>
<P>Likewise several of those that were taken
Captive by the <HI>Indians</HI> are able to relate af|fecting
Stories concerning the gracious Provi|dence
of God, in carrying them through
many Dangers and Deaths, and at last setting
their feet in a large place again. A Worthy
Person hath sent me the Account which one
lately belonging to <HI>Deerfield,</HI> (his name
is <HI>Quintin Stockwell,)</HI> hath drawn up re|specting
his own Captivity and Redempti|on,
with the more notable Occurrences of
Divine Providence attending him in his di|stress,
which I shall therefore here insert in
the Words by himself expressed: He Relateth
as followes;</P>
<Q><P> In the year 1677. <HI>September</HI> 19. between
Sun-set and dark, the <HI>Indians</HI> came upon us;
I and another Man, being together, we ran
away at the out-cry the <HI>Indians</HI> made, shout|ing
and shooting at some other of the <HI>En|glish</HI>
that were hard by. We took a <HI>Swamp</HI>
that was at hand for our refuge; the Enemy
espying us so near them, ran after us, and
shot many Guns at us, three Guns were
<PB N="40" REF="32">
discharged upon me, the Enemy being with|in
three Rod of me, besides many other,
before that. Being in this Swamp that was
miry, I slumpt in, and fell down, where|upon
one of the Enemy stept to me, with
his Hatchet lift upto knock me on the head,
supposing that I had been wounded, and so
unfit for any other travel. I (as it hapned)
had a Pistol by me, which though unchar|ged,
I presented to the <HI>Indian,</HI> who present|ly
stept back; and told me, if I would yield,
I should have no hurt, he said (which was
not true) that they had destroyed all <HI>Hat|field,</HI>
and that the Woods were full of <HI>Indi|ans,</HI>
whereupon I yielded my self, and so
fell into the Enemies hands, and by three of
them was led away unto the place, whence
first I began to make my flight, where two
other <HI>Indians</HI> came running to us, and the
one lifting up the Butt end of his Gun, to
knock me on the head, the other with his
hand put by the blow, and said, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
Friend. I was now by my own House which
the <HI>Indians</HI> burnt the last year, and I was a|bout
to build up again, and there I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
some hopes to escape from them; there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
an Horse just by, which they bid me take, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
did so, but made no attempt to escape ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
by, because the Enemy was near, and the
<PB N="41" REF="32">
Beast was slow and dull, then was I in hopes
they would send me to take my own Hor|ses,
which they did, but they were so frighted
that I could not come near to them, and so
fell still into the Enemies hands, who now
took me, and bound me, and led me away,
and soon was I brought into the Company
of Captives, that were that day brought a|way
from <HI>Hatfield,</HI> which were about a mile
off; and here methoughts was matter of joy
and sorrow both, to see the Company: some
Company in this condition being some re|freshing,
though little help any wayes; then
were we pinioned and led away in the night
over the Mountains, in dark and hideous
wayes, about four miles further, before we
took up our place for rest, which was in a
dismal place of Wood on the East side of
that Mountain. We were kept bound all
that night. The <HI>Indians</HI> kept waking and
we had little mind to sleep in this nights
travel, the <HI>Indians</HI> dispersed, and as they
went made strange noises, as of Wolves
and Owles, and other Wild Beasts, to the
end that they might not lose one another;
and if followed they might not be discover|ed
by the <HI>English.</HI></P><P>About the break of Day, we Marched a|gain
and got over the great River at <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|comptuck</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="33">
River mouth, and there rested a|bout
two hours. There the <HI>Indians</HI> marked
out upon Trays the number of their Cap|tives
and Slain as their manner is. Here was
I again in great danger; A quarrel arose
about me, whose Captive I was, for three
took me. I thought I must be killed to end
the controversie, so when they put it to me,
whose I was, I said three <HI>Indians</HI> took me,
so they agreed to have all a share in me: and
I had now three Masters, and he was my
chief Master who laid hands on me first,
and thus was I fallen into the hands of the
very worst of all the Company; as <HI>Ashpe|lon</HI>
the <HI>Indian</HI> Captain told me; which Ca|ptain
was all along very kind to me, and a
great comfort to the <HI>English.</HI> In this place
they gave us some Victuals, which they had
brought from the <HI>English.</HI> This morning
also they sent ten Men forth to Town to
bring away what they could find, some
Provision, some Corn out of the Meadow
they brought to us upon Horses which they
had there taken. From hence we went up
about the Falls, where we crost that River
again; and whilst I was going, I fell right
down lame of my old Wounds that I had
in the War, and whilest I was thinking I
should therefore be killed by the <HI>Indians,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="33">
and what Death I should die, my pain was
suddenly gone, and I was much encouraged
again. We had about eleven Horses in that
Company, which the <HI>Indians</HI> made to carry
Burthens, and to carry Women. It was af|ternoon
when we now crossed that River,
We travelled up that River till night, and
then took up our Lodging in a dismal place,
and were staked down and spread out on
our backs; and so we lay all night, yea so
we lay many nights. They told me their
Law was, that we should lie so nine nights,
and by that time, it was thought we should
be out of our knowledge. The manner of
staking down was thus; our Arms and Legs
stretched out were staked fast down, and a
Cord about our necks, so that we could
stir no wayes. The first night of staking
down, being much tired, I slept as comfor|tably
as ever; the next day we went up the
River, and crossed it, and at night lay in
<HI>Squakheag Meadows;</HI> our Provision was
soon spent; and while we lay in those <HI>Mea|dows</HI>
the <HI>Indians</HI> went an Hunting, and the
<HI>English Army</HI> came out after us: then the
<HI>Indians</HI> moved again, dividing themselves
and the Captives into many Companies,
that the <HI>English</HI> might not follow their tract.
At night having crossed the River, we met
<PB N="44" REF="34">
again at the place appointed. The next day
we crost the River again on <HI>Squakheag</HI> side,
and there we took up our quarters for a
long time, I suppose this might be about
thirty miles above <HI>Squakheag,</HI> and here were
the <HI>Indians</HI> quite out of all fear of the <HI>En|glish;</HI>
but in great fear of the <HI>Mohawks;</HI>
here they built a long <HI>Wigwam.</HI> Here they
had a great Dance (as they call it) and
concluded to burn three of us, and had got
Bark to do it with, and as I understood
afterwards, I was one that was to be burnt.
Sergeant <HI>Plimpton</HI> an other, and <HI>Benjamin
Wait</HI> his Wife the third: though I knew
not which was to be burnt, yet I perceived
some were designed thereunto, so much I
understood of their Language: that night I
could not sleep for fear of next dayes work,
the <HI>Indians</HI> being weary with that Dance,
lay down to sleep, and slept soundly. The
<HI>English</HI> were all loose, then I went out and
brought in Wood, and mended the fire,
and made a noise on purpose, but none a|waked,
I thought if any of the <HI>English</HI>
would wake, we might kill them all sleeping,
I removed out of the way all the Guns and
Hatchets: but my heart failing me, I put
all things where they were again. The
next day when we were to be burnt, our
<PB N="45" REF="34">
Master and some others spake for us, and
the Evil was prevented in this place: And
hereabouts we lay three Weeks together.
Here I had a Shirt brought to me, to make,
and one <HI>Indian</HI> said it should be made this
way, a second another way, a third his way.
I told them I would make it that way that
my chief Master said; Whereupon one <HI>In|dian</HI>
struck me on the face with his Fist.
I suddenly rose up in anger ready to strike
again, upon this hapned a great Hubbub,
and the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English</HI> came about me;
I was fain to humble my self to my Master,
so that matter was put up. Before I came
to this place, my three Masters were gone
a hunting, I was left with an other <HI>Indian,</HI>
all the Company being upon a March, I
was left with this <HI>Indian,</HI> who fell sick, so
that I was fain to carry his Gun and Hat|chet,
and had opportunity, and had thought
to have dispatched him, and run away; but
did not, for that the <HI>English</HI> Captives had
promised the contrary to one another, be|cause
if one should run away, that would
provoke the <HI>Indians,</HI> and indanger the rest
that could not run away. Whilest we
were here, <HI>Benjamin Stebbins</HI> going with
some <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>Wachuset Hills,</HI> made his
<PB N="46" REF="35">
escape from them, and when the news of
his escape came; we were all presently cal|led
in and Bound; one of the <HI>Indians</HI> a
Captain among them, and alwayes our
great Friend, met me coming in, and told
me <HI>Stebbins</HI> was run away; and the <HI>Indians</HI>
spake of burning us; some of only burn|ing
and biting off our Fingers by and by.
He said there would be a Court, and all
would speak their minds, but he would speak
last, and would say, that the <HI>Indian</HI> that let
<HI>Stebbins</HI> run away was only in fault, and so
no hurt should be done us, fear not: so it
proved accordingly. Whilest we lingered
hereabout, Provision grew scarce, one Bears
Foot must serve five of us a whole day; we
began to eat Horse-flesh, and eat up seven
in all: three were left alive and were not
killed. Whilest we had been here, some of
the <HI>Indians</HI> had been down and fallen upon
<HI>Hadley,</HI> and were taken by the <HI>English,</HI> a|greed
with, and let go again; and were to
meet the <HI>English</HI> upon such a Plain, there
to make further Terms. <HI>Ashpalon</HI> was much
for it, but <HI>Wachuset</HI> Sachims when they came
were much against it: and were for this,
that we should meet the <HI>English</HI> indeed, but
there fall upon them and fight them, and
take them. Then <HI>Ashpalon</HI> spake to us <HI>En|glish,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="35">
not to speak a word more to further
that matter, for mischief would come of it.
When those <HI>Indians</HI> came from <HI>Wachuset,</HI>
there came with them <HI>Squaws,</HI> and <HI>Children</HI>
about four-score, who reported that the <HI>En|glish</HI>
had taken <HI>Uncas,</HI> and all his Men, and
sent them beyond Seas, they were much
enraged at this, and asked us if it were true;
we said no, then was <HI>Ashpalon</HI> angry, and
said, he would no more believe <HI>English-men.</HI>
For they examined us every one apart; then
they dealt worse by us for a season than be|fore:
Still Provision was fearce. We
came at length to a place called <HI>Squaw-Maug
River,</HI> there we hoped for <HI>Sammon,</HI>
but we came too late. This place I account
to be above two hundred Miles above <HI>Deer|field:</HI>
then we parted into two Companies;
some went one way and some went ano|ther
way; and we went over a mighty
Mountain, we were eight dayes a going over
it, and travelled very hard, and every day
we had either Snow or Rain: We noted
that on this Mountain all the Water run
<HI>Northward.</HI> Here also we wanted Provision;
but at length met again on the other side of
the Mountain, <HI>viz.</HI> on the <HI>North side</HI> of this
Mountain at a River, that run into the
Lake, and we were then half a dayes jour|ney
<PB N="48" REF="36">
off the Lake, we stayed here a great
while to make Canoos to go over the Lake;
here I was frozen, &amp; here again we were like
to starve: All the <HI>Indians</HI> went a Hunting but
could get nothing: divers dayes they <HI>Po|wow'd</HI>
but got nothing, then they desired
the <HI>English</HI> to Pray, and confessed they
could do nothing; they would have us Pray,
and see what the <HI>English-man's God</HI> could do.
I Prayed, so did Serjeant <HI>Plimpton,</HI> in ano|ther
place. The <HI>Indians</HI> reverently attend|ed,
Morning and Night; next day they got
Bears: then they would needs have us de|sire
a Blessing, return Thanks at Meals: af|ter
a while they grew weary of it, and the
<HI>Sachim</HI> did forbid us: When I was frozen
they were very cruel towards me, because I
could not do as at other times. When we
came to the Lake we were again sadly put to
it for Provision; we were fain to eat Touch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">wood
fryed in Bears Greace, at last we
found a company of <HI>Raccoons,</HI> and then we
made a Feast; and the manner was, that
we must eat all. I perceived there would be
too much for one time, so one <HI>Indian</HI> that
sat next to me, bid me slip away some to
him under his Coat, and he would hid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
it for me till another time; this <HI>Indian</HI> as
soon as he had got my Meat, stood up and
<PB N="49" REF="36">
made a Speech to the rest, and discovered
me; so that the <HI>Indians</HI> were very angry, and
cut me another piece, and gave me <HI>Raccoon
Grease</HI> to drink, which made me sick and
Vomit. I told them I had enough; so that
ever after that they would give me none<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
but still tell me, I had <HI>Raccoon</HI> enough: so
I suffered much, and being frozen was full
of Pain, and could sleep but a little, yet
must do my work. When they went upon
the Lake, and as they came to the Lake,
they light of a <HI>Moose</HI> and killed it, and staid
there till they had eaten it all up; and en|tring
upon the Lake there arose a great
Storm, we thought we should all be cast a|way,
but at last we got to an Island, and
there they went to <HI>Powawing.</HI> The <HI>Powa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
said that <HI>Benjamin Wait,</HI> and another Man&punc;
was coming, and that Storm was raised to
cast them away: This afterward appeared
to be true, though then I believed them not.
Upon this Island we lay still several dayes,
and then set out again, but a Storm took us,
so that we lay to and fro upon certain
Islands about three Weeks: we had no pro|vision
but <HI>Raccoons,</HI> so that the <HI>Indians</HI> them|selves
thought they should be starved. They
gave me nothing, so that I was sundry dayes
without any Provision: We went on upon
<PB N="50" REF="37">
the Lake upon that Isle about a dayes jour|ney:
we had a little Sled upon which we
drew our Load; before Noon, I tired, and
just then the <HI>Indians</HI> met with some <HI>French-men;</HI>
then one of the <HI>Indians</HI> that took me
came to me, and called me all manner of
bad Names; and threw me down upon my
back: I told him I could not do any more,
then he said he must kill me, I thought he
was about it, for he pulled out his Knife, and
cut out my Pockets, and wrapt them about
my Face, helped me up, and took my Sled
and went away, and gave me a bit of Bis|cake,
as big as a Walnut, which he had of
the <HI>French-man,</HI> and told me he would give
me a Pipe of Tobacco; when my Sled was
gone, I could run after him, but at last I
could not run, but went a foot-pace, then
the <HI>Indians</HI> were soon out of sight, I follow|ed
as well as I could; I had many Falls upon
the Ice; at last I was so spent, I had not
strength enough to rise again, but I crept to
a Tree that lay along, and got upon it, and
there I lay; it was now night, and very
sharp Weather: I counted no other but that
I must die there; whilest I was thinking of
Death, an <HI>Indian</HI> Hallowed, and I answer|ed
him; he came to me, and called me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
names, and told me if I could not go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="51" REF="37">
must knock me on the head; I told him he
must then so do; he saw how I had Wal|lowed
in that Snow, but could not rise: then&punc;
he took his Coat, and wrapt me in it, and
went back, and sent two <HI>Indians</HI> with a Sled,
one said he must knock me on the Head,
the other said No, they would carry me a|way
and burn me; then they bid me stir
my Instep to see if that were frozen, I did
so, when they saw that, they said that vvas
<HI>Wurregen;</HI> there vvas a Chirurgeon at the
<HI>French</HI> that could cure me; then they took
me upon the Sled, and carried me to the
fire, and they then made much of me; pul|led
off my vvet, and vvrapped me in dry
Clothes, made me a good Bed. They had
killed an Otter, and gave me some of the
Broth, and a bit of the Flesh: here I slept
till tovvards day, and then vvas able to get
up, and put on my clothes; one of the <HI>In|dians</HI>
awaked, and seeing me go, shouted, as
rejoycing at it: as soon as it vvas light I
and <HI>Samuel Russel</HI> vvent before on the Ice,
upon a River, they said I must go vvhere I
could on foot, else I should frieze. <HI>Samuel
Russel</HI> slipt into the River vvith one Foot,
the <HI>Indians</HI> called him back and dried his
Stockins, and then sent us avvay; and an
<HI>Indian</HI> vvith us to Pilot us: and vve vvent

four or five miles before they overtook us: I
was then pretty well spent; <HI>Samuel Russel</HI>
was (he said) faint, and wondred how I
could live, for he had (he said) ten meals
to my one: then I was laid on the Sled,
and they ran away with me on the Ice, the
rest and <HI>Samuel Russel</HI> came softly after.
<HI>Samuel Russel</HI> I never saw more, nor know
what became of him: they got but half
way, and we got through to <HI>Shamblee</HI> about
midnight. Six miles of <HI>Shamblee</HI> (a <HI>French</HI>
Town) the River was open, and when I
came to travail in that part of the Ice, I
soon tired; and two <HI>Indians</HI> run away to
Town, and one only was left: he would
carry me a few rods, and then I would go
as many, and that trade we drave, and so
were long a going six miles. This <HI>Indian</HI>
now was kind, and told me that if he did not
carry me I would die, and so I should have
done sure enough: And he said, I must tell
the <HI>English</HI> how he helped me. When we
came to the first House there was no Inha|bitant:
the <HI>Indian</HI> spent, both discouraged;
he said we must now both die, at last he left
me alone, and got to another House, and
thence came some <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> and
brought me in: the <HI>French</HI> were kind, and
put my hands and feet in cold Water, and
<PB N="53" REF="40">
gave me a Dram of Brandey, and a little
hasty pudding and Milk; when I tasted
Victuals I was hungry, and could not have
forborn it, but that I could not get it; now
and then they would give me a little as they
thought best for me; I lay by the fire with
the <HI>Indians</HI> that night, but could not sleep
for pain: next morning the <HI>Indians</HI> and
<HI>French</HI> fell out about me, because the <HI>French</HI>
as the <HI>Indian</HI> said, loved the <HI>English</HI> better
than the <HI>Indians.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> presently
turned the <HI>Indians</HI> out of doors, and kept me,
they were very kind and careful, and gave
me a little something now and then; while
I was here all the Men in that Town came
to see me: At this House I was three or
four dayes, and then invited to another, and
after that to another; at this place I was a|bout
thirteen dayes, and received much ci|vility
from a young man, a Batchelour, who
invited me to his House, with whom I was
for the most part, he was so kind as to lodge
me in the Bed with himself, he gave me a
Shirt, and would have bought me, but could
not, for the <HI>Indians</HI> asked a hundred pounds
for me. We were then to go to a place
called <HI>Surril,</HI> and that young-man would go
with me, because the <HI>Indians</HI> should not hurt
me: this Man carried me on the Ice one

dayes Journey: for I could not now go at
all: then there was so much Water on the
Ice, we could go no further: so the <HI>French|man</HI>
left me, and Provision for me; here we
stayed two nights, and then travailed again,
for then the Ice was strong; and in two
dayes more I came to <HI>Surril;</HI> the first house
we came to was late in the night, here a|gain
the People were kind. Next day be|ing
in much pain, I asked the <HI>Indians</HI> to car|ry
me to the Chirurgeons, as they had pro|mised,
at which they were wroth, and one
of them took up his Gun to knock me;
but the <HI>French-men</HI> would not suffer it, but
set upon him, and kicked him out of doors;
then we went away from thence to a place
two or three miles off, where the <HI>Indians</HI>
had <HI>Wigwams;</HI> when I came to these <HI>Wig|wams</HI>
some of the <HI>Indians</HI> knew me, and
seemed to pity me. While I was here,
which was three or four dayes, the <HI>French</HI>
came to see me, and it being <HI>Christmas</HI>
time, they brought Cakes and other Provi|sions
with them, and gave to me, so that I
had no want: the <HI>Indians</HI> tried to cure me,
but could not, then I asked for the Chirur|geon,
at which one of the <HI>Indians</HI> in anger,
struck me on the face with his Fist, a <HI>French<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> being by, the <HI>French-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> spake to him,
<PB N="55" REF="41">
I knew not what he said, and went his way
By and by came the Captain of the place
into the <HI>Wigwam</HI> with about twelve armed
Men, and asked where the <HI>Indian</HI> was that
struck the <HI>English-man,</HI> and took him and
told him he should go to the Bilboes, and
then be hanged: the <HI>Indians</HI> were much te|rified
at this, as appeared by their Counte|nances
and Trembling. I would have gone
too, but the <HI>French-man</HI> bid me not fear, the
<HI>Indians</HI> durst not hurt me. When that <HI>In|dian</HI>
was gone, I had two Masters still, I
asked them to carry me to that Captain that
I might speak for the <HI>Indian,</HI> they answered,
I was a Fool, did I think the <HI>French-men</HI> were
like to the <HI>English,</HI> to say one thing and do
another? they were men of their words,
but I prevailed with them to help me thither,
and I spake to the Captain by an Interpre|ter,
and told him I desired him to set the <HI>In|dian</HI>
free, and told him what he had done
for me, he told me he was a Rogue, and
should be hanged; then I spake more pri|vately,
alledging this Reason, because all the
<HI>English Captives</HI> were not come in, if he
were hanged, it might fare the worse with
them; then the Captain said, that was to be
considered: then he set him at liberty, upon
this condition, that he should never strike
<PB N="56" REF="42">
me more, and every day bring me to his
House to eat Victuals. I perceived that the
common People did not like what the <HI>In|dians</HI>
had done and did to the <HI>English.</HI> When
the <HI>Indian</HI> was set free, he came to me, and
took me about the middle, and said I was his
Brother, I had saved his life once, and he
had saved mine (he said) thrice. Then
he called for Brandy and made me drink,
and had me away to the <HI>Wigwams</HI> again,
When I came there, the <HI>Indians</HI> came to me
one by one, to shake hands with me, saying
<HI>Wurregen Netop;</HI> and were very kind, think|ing
no other, but that I had saved the <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
Life. The next day he carried me to
that Captains house, and set me down;
they gave me my Victuals and Wine, and
being left there a while by the <HI>Indians, I</HI>
shewed the Captain my Fingers, which when
he and his Wife saw, he and his Wife run
away from the sight, and bid me lap it up
again, and sent for the Chirurgeon, who
when he came, said he could cure me, and
took it in hand, and dressed it; the <HI>Indian</HI>
towards night came for me, I told them I
could not go with them, they were displea|sed,
called me Rogue, and went away; that
night I was full of pain, the <HI>French</HI> did fear
that I would die, five Men did Watch with
<PB N="57" REF="42">
me, and strove to keep me chearly: for I
was sometimes ready to faint: Often times
they gave me a little Brandy. The next day
the Chirurgion came again, and dressed me;
and so he did all the while I was among the
<HI>French. I</HI> came in at <HI>Christmass,</HI> and went
thence <HI>May</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> Being thus in the Cap|tain's
house, <HI>I</HI> was kept there till <HI>Ben. Wait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
came: &amp; my <HI>Indian</HI> Master being in want of
Money, pawned me to the Captain for 14.
<HI>Beavers,</HI> or the worth of them, at such a
day; if he did not pay he must lose his Pawn,
or else sell me for twenty one Beavers, but he
could not get Beaver, and so <HI>I</HI> was sold. </P></Q>
<P>But by
being thus sold he was in Gods good time set
at liberty, and returned to his Friends in <HI>New-England</HI>
again.</P>
<P>Thus far is this poor Captives Relation
concerning the changes of Providence which
passed over him.</P>
<P>There is one Remarkable passage more,
affirmed by him: For he saith, that in their
Travails they came to a place where was a
great <HI>Wigwam</HI> (i. e. <HI>Indian House)</HI> at both
ends was an <HI>Image;</HI> here the <HI>Indians</HI> in the
War time were wont to <HI>Powaw</HI> (i. e. invo|cate
the Devil) and so did they come down
to <HI>Hatfield,</HI> one of the <HI>Images</HI> told them they
should destroy a Town; the other said no,
<PB N="58" REF="43">
half a Town. This god (said that <HI>Indian)</HI>
speaks true, the other was not good, he told
them lies. No doubt but others are capable
of declaring many passages of Divine Pro|vidence
no less worthy to be Recorded than
these last recited; but inasmuch as they have
not been brought to my hands, <HI>I</HI> proceed to
another Relation.</P>
<P>Very Memorable was the Providence of
God towards Mr. <HI>Ephraim How</HI> of <HI>New-Ha|ven</HI>
in <HI>New-England,</HI> who was for an whole
twelve Moneth given up by his Friends as a
dead Man, but God preserved him alive in a
desolate <HI>Island</HI> where he had suffered Ship|wrack,
and at last returned him home to his
Family.</P>
<P>The History of this Providence might
have been mentioned amongst <HI>Sea-Delive|rances,</HI>
yet considering it was not only so, <HI>I</HI>
shall here <HI>Record</HI> what himself (being a god|ly
man) did relate of the Lords marvelous
dispensations towards him, that so others
might be incouraged to put their trust in
God, in the times of their greatest straits and
difficulties.</P>
<P>On the 25. of <HI>August,</HI> in the year 1676.
the said Skipper <HI>How</HI> with his two eldest Sons
set sail from <HI>New-Haven</HI> for <HI>Boston</HI> in a small
<PB N="59" REF="43">
Ketch, Burden 17 Tun or thereabout: Af|ter
the Dispatch of their Business there, they
set Sail from thence for <HI>New-Haven</HI> again, on
the 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> following: but contra|ry
Winds forced them back to <HI>Boston,</HI> where
the said <HI>How</HI> was taken ill with a violent flux,
which Distemper continued near a Moneth,
many being at that time sick of the same
Disease, which proved mortal to some. The
merciful Providence of God having spared
his life, and restored him to some measure of
health; he again set Sail from <HI>Boston,</HI> Octo|ber
10. By a fair Wind they went forward
so as to make <HI>Cape Cod;</HI> but suddenly the
Weather became very Tempestuous, so as
that they could not seize the <HI>Cape,</HI> but were
forced off to Sea; where they were endan|gered
in a small Vessel by very fearful Storms
and outragious Winds and Seas. Also, his
Eldest Son fell sick and died in about eleven
dayes after they set out to Sea. He was no
sooner dead, but his other Son fell sick and
died too. This was a bitter Cup to the good
Father. It is noted in 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 7. 22. that when
the Sons of <HI>Ephraim</HI> were dead, <HI>Ephraim their
Father mourned many dayes, and his Brethren
came to comfort him.</HI> This <HI>Ephraim</HI> when his
Sons were Dead his Friends on Shore knew
it not, nor could they come to comfort him.
<PB N="60" REF="44">
But when his Friends and Relations could
not, the Lord himself did: for they died af|ter
so sweet, gracious and comfortable a man|ner,
as that their Father professed he had joy
in parting with them. Yet now their out|ward
distress and danger was become greater,
since the <HI>Skipper</HI>'s two Sons were the only
help he had in working the Vessel. Not long
after, another of the Company, <HI>viz. Caleb
Iones,</HI> (Son to Mr. <HI>William Iones</HI> one of the
Worthy Magistrates in <HI>New-Haven</HI>) fell sick
and died also, leaving the World with com|fortable
manifestations of true Repentance
towards God, and Faith in Jesus Christ. Thus
the one half of their Company was taken a|way,
none remaining but the Skipper him|self,
one Mr. <HI>Augur,</HI> and a Boy. He him|self
was still sickly, and in a very weak estate,
yet was fain to stand at the Helm 36 hours,
and 24 hours at a time; in the mean time
the boisterous Sea overwhelming the Vessel,
so as that if he had not been lasht fast, he
had certainly been washed over-board. In
this Extremity, he was at a loss in his own
thoughts, whether they should persist in stri|ving
for the <HI>New-England</HI> Shore, or bear a|way
for the Southern Islands. He proposed
that Question to Mr. <HI>Augur,</HI> they resolved
that they would first seek to God by Prayer
<PB N="61" REF="44">
about it, and then put this difficult case to an
issue, by casting a Lot. So they did; and the
Lot fell on <HI>New-England.</HI> By that time a
Moneth was expired, they lost the Rudder
of their Vessel, so that now they had nothing
but God alone to rely upon. In this deplo|rable
state were they for a fortnight. The
<HI>Skipper</HI> (though infirm (as has been expres|sed)
yet for six weeks together, was hardly
ever dry; nor had they the benefit of warm
Food for more then thrice or thereabouts.
At the end of six weeks, in the Morning
betimes, the Vessel was driven on the Tail|ings
of a ledge of Rocks, where the Sea
broke violently; looking out they espied a
dismal Rocky Island to the Leeward, upon
which if the Providence of God had not by
the Breakers given them timely warning,
they had been dashed in pieces. And this
extremity was the Lords opportunity to ap|pear
for their deliverance; they immediately
let go an Anchor, and get out the Boat; and
God made the Sea calm. The Boat proved
leaky; and being in the midst of fears and
amazements they took little out of the Ves|sel.
After they came ashoar they found
themselves in a rocky desolate Island (near
<HI>Cape Sables</HI>) where was neither Man not
Beast to be seen, so that now they were in
<PB N="62" REF="45">
extream danger of being starved to Death.
But a Storm arose which beat violently upon
the Vessel at Anchor, so as that it was staved
in pieces; and a Cask of Powder was brought
ashore, (receiving no damage by its being
washed in the Water) also a Barrel of Wine,
and half a Barrel of Molosses, together with
many things useful for a Tent to preserve
them from cold. This notwithstanding, new
and great distresses attended them. For
though they had Powder and Shot, there
were seldom any Fowls to be seen in that
Dismal and Desolate place, excepting a few
<HI>Crows, Ravens</HI> and <HI>Gulls.</HI> These were so few
as that for the most part, the <HI>Skipper</HI> shot at
one at a time. Many times half of one of
these Fowls with the Liquor made a Meal
for three. Once they lived five dayes with|out
any Sustenance, at which time they did
not feel themselves pincht with hunger as at
other times; the Lord in mercy taking away
their appetites, when their Food did utterly
fail them. After they had been about twelve
Weeks in this miserable Island, Mr. <HI>How's</HI>
dear Friend and Consort Mr, <HI>Augur</HI> Died;
so that he had no living creature but the Lad
before mentioned to converse with: And
on <HI>April</HI> 2. 1677. that Lad Died also, so that
the Master was now left alone upon the
<PB N="63" REF="45">
Island, and continued so to be above a quar|ter
of a year, not having any living Soul to
converse with. In this time he saw several
Fishing Vessels Sailing by, and some came
nearer the Island than that which at last took
him in; but though he used what means he
could that they might be acquainted with his
Distress, none came to him, being afraid: for
they supposed him to be one of those <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
who were then in Hostility against the
<HI>English.</HI> The good Man whilest he was in
his Desolate Estate, kept many dayes of Fast|ing
and Prayer, wherein he did confess and
bewail his Sins, the least of which deserved
greater Evils than any in this World ever
were or can be subject unto; and begged of
God that he would find out a way for his
Deliverance. At last it came into his mind,
that he ought very solemnly to praise God
(as well as pray unto him) for the great
mercies and signal preservations which he
had thus far experienced. Accordingly he
set apart a day for that end, spending the
time in giving thanks to God for all the mer|cies
of his Life, so far as he could call them
to mind, and in special for those Divine Fa|vours
which had been mingled with his af|flictions;
humbly blessing God for his
<PB N="64" REF="46">
wonderful goodness in preserving him alive
by a Miracle of Mercy. Immediately after
this, a Vessel belonging to <HI>Salem</HI> in <HI>New-En|gland</HI>
providentially passing by that Island,
sent their Boat on shore, and took in <HI>Skipper
How,</HI> who arrived at <HI>Salem,</HI> July 18. 1677.
and was at last returned to his Family in
<HI>New-Haven.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this occasion it may not be amiss
to commemorate a Providence not altoge|ther
unlike unto the but now related preser|vation
of Skipper <HI>How.</HI> The Story which I
intend is mentioned by <HI>Mandelsloe</HI> in his
Travails, <HI>Page</HI> 280. and more fully by Mr.
<HI>Clark</HI> in his <HI>Examples,</HI> Vol. 2. <HI>Page</HI> 618. Mr.
<HI>Burton</HI> in his Prodigies of Mercies, <HI>Page</HI> 209.
Yet inasmuch as but few in this Countrey
have the Authors mentioned, I shall here in|sert
what has been by them already pub|lished.</P>
<P>The Story is in brief as followeth:</P>
<Q><P>In the Year 1616. A <HI>Fleming</HI> whose name
was <HI>Pickman,</HI> coming from <HI>Norway</HI> in a
Vessel loaden with Boards, was overtaken
by a Calm, during which the Current car|ried
him upon a Rock or little Island
towards the extremities of <HI>Scotland.</HI>
To avoid a Wreck he commanded some of
his Men to go into the Shallop, and to
<PB N="65" REF="46">
Tow the Ship. They having done so,
would needs go up into a certain Rock to
look for Birds Eggs: But as soon as they
were got up into it, they at some distance
perceived a Man, whence they imagined
that there were others lurking thereabouts,
and that this man had made his escape
thither from some Pyrates, who, if not pre|vented,
might surprize their Ship: and
therefore they made all the hast they could
to their Shallop, and so returned to their
Ship. But the Calm continuing, and the
Current of the Sea still driving them upon
the Island, they were forced to get into the
Long-boat, and to Tow her off again. The
Man whom they had seen before was in
the mean time come to the brink of the
Island, and made signs with his hands lifted
up, and sometimes falling on his knees, and
joyning his hands together, begging and
crying to them for relief. At first they made
some difficulty to get to him, but at last, be|ing
overcome by his lamentable signs, they
went nearer the Island, where they saw
something that was more like a Ghost than
a living Person; a Body stark naked, black
and hairy, a meagre and deformed Counte|nance,
with hollow and distorted eyes;
which raised such compassion in them, that
<PB N="66" REF="47">
they essayed to take him into the Boat:
but the Rock was so steepy thereabouts,
that it was impossible for them to land:
whereupon they went about the Island, and
came at last to a flat shore, where they took
the Man aboard. They found nothing at
all in the Island, neither Grass nor Tree,
nor ought else from which a man could pro|cure
any subsistence, nor any shelter, but
the ruins of a Boat, wherewith he had made
a kind of a Hutt, under which he might
lie down and shelter himself, against the
injuries of Wind and Weather. No sooner
were they gotten to the Ship, but there a|rose
a Wind, that drave them off from the
Island: observing this Providence, they
were the more inquisitive to know of this
Man, what he was, and by what means he
came unto that uninhabitable place?</P></Q>
<P>Hereunto the Man Answered;</P>
<Q><P>I am an <HI>English Man,</HI> that about a Year
ago, was to pass in the Ordinary Passage-Boat
from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Dublin</HI> in <HI>Ireland;</HI> but
by the way we were taken by a <HI>French Pi|rate,</HI>
who being immediately forced by a
Tempest, which presently arose, to let our
Boat go; we were three of us in it, left
to the mercy of the Wind and Waves,
which carried us between <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scot|land</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="47">
into the main Sea: In the mean time
we had neither Food nor Drink, but only
some Sugar in the Boat; upon this we li|ved,
and drank our own Urine, till our bo|dies
were so dried up, that we could make
no more: whereupon one of our Company
being quite spent, died; whom we heaved
overboard: and a while after a second was
grown so feeble, that he had laid himself a|long
in the Boat, ready to give up the
Ghost: But in this extremity it pleased God
that I kenned this Island afar off, and
thereupon encouraged the dying man to
rouse up himself, with hopes of life: and
accordingly, upon this good news, he raised
himself up, and by and by our Boat was cast
upon this Island, and split against a Rock.</P><P>Now we were in a more wretched con|dition
than if we had been swallowed up
by the Sea, for then we had been delivered
out of the Extremities we were now in for
want of Meat and Drink; yet the Lord
was pleased to make some provision for us:
for on the Island we took some <HI>Sea-mews,</HI>
which we did eat raw: We found also in
the holes of the Rocks, upon the Sea-side,
some Eggs; and thus had we through Gods
good Providence wherewithal to subsist, as
much as would keep us from starving: but
<PB N="68" REF="48">
what we thought most unsupportable, was
thirst, in regard that the place afforded no
fresh Water but what fell from the Clouds,
and was left in certain Pits, which time had
made in the Rock. Neither could we have
this at all seasons, by reason that the Rock
being small, and lying low, in stormy Wea|ther
the Waves dashed over it, and filled
the Pits with Salt Water.</P><P>When they came first upon the Island a|bout
the midst of it, they found two long
Stones pitched in the Ground, and a third
laid upon them, like a Table; which they
judged to have been so placed by some
Fishermen to dry their Fish upon; and un|der
this they lay in the nights, till with some
Boards of their Boat, they made a kind of
an Hutt to be a shelter for them. In this
condition they lived together, for the space
of about six Weeks, comforting one ano|ther,
and finding some ease in their com|mon
calamity: till at last one of them be|ing
left alone, the burden became almost
insupportable: For one day, awaking in the
Morning he missed his Fellow, and getting
up, he went calling and seeking all the
Island about for him, but when he could
by no means find him, he fell into such de|spair,
that he often resolved to have cast
<PB N="69" REF="48">
himself down into the Sea, and so to put a
final Period to that affliction, whereof he
had endured but the one half, whilst he had
a Friend that divided it with him. What
became of his Comrade he could not guess,
whether despair forced him to that extre|mity,
or whether getting up in the night,
not fully awake, he fell from the Rock, as
he was looking for Birds Eggs: for he had
discovered no distraction in him, neither
could imagine that he could on a sudden
fall into that despair, against which he had
so fortified himself by frequent and fervent
Prayer. And his loss did so affect the Sur|viver,
that he often took his beer, with a
purpose to have leaped from the Rocks in|to
the Sea, yet still his Conscience stopped
him, suggesting to him, that if he did it, he
would be utterly damned for his self-Mur|ther.</P><P>Another Affliction also befel him, which
was this; his only Knife wherewith he cut
up the <HI>Sea-Dogs</HI> and <HI>Sea-Mews,</HI> having a
bloody cloth about it, was carried away (as
he thought) by some fowl of Prey; so
that, not being able to kill any more, he
was reduced to this extremity, with much
difficulty to get out of the Boards of his
Hutt, a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> which he made shift so
<PB N="70" REF="49">
to sharpen upon the Stones, that it served
him instead of a Knife. When Winter
came on, he endured the greatest misery
imaginable: for many times the Rock and
his Hutt were so covered with Snow, that
it was not possible for him to go abroad to
provide his Food; which extremity put him
upon this Invention: he put out a little
stick at the crevice of his Hutt, and bait|ing
it with a little <HI>Sea-Dogs</HI> fat, by that
means he got some <HI>Sea-Mews,</HI> which he
took with his hand from under the Snow,
and so kept himself from starving. In this
sad and solitary condition, he lived for a|bout
eleven Moneths, expecting therein to
end his dayes, when Gods gracious provi|dence
sent this Ship thither, which delivered
him out of the greatest misery that ever
man was in. The Master of the Ship
commiserating his deplorable condition,
treated him so well, that within a few dayes
he was quite another creature; and after|wards
he set him a shore at <HI>Derry</HI> in <HI>Ire|land;</HI>
and sometimes after he saw him at
<HI>Dublin:</HI> where such as heard what had hap|ned
unto him, gave him Money, where|withal
to return into his Native Countrey
of <HI>England.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Thus far is that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ation.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="49">
I have seen a Manuscript, wherein many
memorable Passages of Divine Providence
are Recorded. And this which I shall now
mention amongst others.</P>
<P>About the Year 1638. A Ship fell foul
upon the Rocks and Sands, called the <HI>Ran|cadories,</HI>
sixty Leagues distant from the <HI>Isle of
Providence.</HI> Ten of the floating Passengers
got to a spot of Land, where having breathed
awhile, and expecting to perish by Famine,
eight of them chose rather to commit them|selves
to the mercy of the waters; two only
stood upon the spot of Land, one whereof
soon died, and was in the Sands buried by his
now desolate Companion. This solitary
Person in the midst of the roaring Waters
was encompassed with the goodness of Divine
Providence. Within three dayes God was
pleased to send this single person (who now
alone, was Lord and Subject in this his little
Common-wealth) good store of Fowl, and
to render them so tame, that the forlorn man
could pick and chuse where he list. Fish also
were now and then cast up within his reach,
and somewhat that served for Fewel, enkind|led
by Flint to dress them. Thus lived that
<HI>Insulary Anchorite</HI> for about two years, till at
last having espied a <HI>Dutch Vessel,</HI> he held a rag
of his Shirt upon the top of a stick towards
<PB N="72" REF="50">
them, which being come within view of, they
used means to fetch him off the Said-spot
of Sand, and brought him to the <HI>Isle of Pro|vidence.</HI>
The Man having in so long a time
conversed only with Heaven, lookt at first
very strangely, and was not able at first Con|ference
promptly to speak and answer.</P>

<P>THere are who affirm that although ter|rible

ever been frequent in this Land, yet none
were hurt thereby (neither Man nor Beast)
for many years after the <HI>English</HI> did first settle
in these <HI>American Desarts.</HI> But that of later
years fatal and fearful slaughters have in that
<PB N="73" REF="50">
way been made amongst us, is most certain.
And there are many who have in this respect
been as Brands plucked out of the burning,
when the Lord hath overthrown others as
God overthrew <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI> Such
solemn works of Providence ought not to be
forgotten. I shall now therefore proceed in
giving an account of <HI>Remarkables</HI> respecting
Thunder and Lightning, so far as I have re|ceived
credible Information concerning them;
The Particulars whereof are these which
follow:</P>
<P>In <HI>Iuly</HI> 1654. A Man whose Name was
<HI>Partridge</HI> (esteemed a very godly person) at
<HI>Salisbury</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> was killed with
Thunder and Lightning, his House being
first set on fire thereby, and himself with o|thers
endeavouring the quenching of it, by a
second crack of Thunder with Lightning (he
being at the door of his House) was struck
dead, and never spake more. There were
ten other persons also that were struck and
lay for dead at the present, but they all re|vived,
excepting <HI>Partridge.</HI> Some that view|ed
him, report that there were holes (like
such as are made with shot) found in his
Clothes, and Skin. One side of his Shirt and
Body was scorched, and not the other. His
House, though (as was said) set on fire by
<PB N="74" REF="51">
the Lightning in divers places, was not burnt
down, but preserved by an abundance of
Rain falling upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Iuly</HI> 31. 1658. There hapned a Storm of
Thunder and Lightning with Rain, in the
Town of <HI>Marshfield</HI> in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony in
<HI>New-England:</HI> Mr. <HI>Nathaneel Thomas, Iohn
Philips,</HI> and another belonging to that Town,
being in the Field, as they perceived the
Storm a coming, betook themselves to the
next House for Shelter: <HI>Iohn Philips</HI> sat down
near the Chimney, his Face towards the inner
Door. A black Cloud flying very low, out
of it there came a great Ball of Fire, with a
terrible crack of Thunder; the Fire-ball fell
down just before the said <HI>Philips,</HI> he seemed
to give a start on his Seat, and so fell back|ward,
being struck dead, not the least moti|on
of life appearing in him afterwards. Cap|tain
<HI>Thomas</HI> who sat directly opposite to <HI>Iohn
Philips,</HI> about six foot distance from him, and
a young Child that was then within three
foot of him, through the Providence of God
received no hurt, Yet many Bricks in the
Chimney were beaten down, the principal
Rafters split, the Battens next the Chimney
in the Chamber were broken, one of the
main Posts of the House into which the
<PB N="75" REF="51">
Summer was framed rent into shivers, and a
great part of it was carried several Rod from
the House, the Door before <HI>Philips,</HI> where
the fire came down, was broken.</P>
<P>On the 28 of <HI>April A. D.</HI> 1664. A Com|pany
of the Neighbours being met together
at the House of <HI>Henry Condliff</HI> in <HI>North-Ham|pton</HI>
in <HI>New-England,</HI> to spend a few hours in
Christian Conferences, and in Prayer; there
hapned a Storm of Thunder and Rain; and
as the good Man of the House was at Prayer,
there came a Ball of Lightning in at the
roof of the House which set the Thatch on
fire, grated on the Timber, pierced through
the Chamber-floor, no breach being made on
the Boards; only one of the jouyces some|what
rased; <HI>Matthew Cole</HI> (who was Son in
Law to the said <HI>Condliff)</HI> was struck stone
dead as he was leaning over a Table, and
joyning with the rest in Prayer. He did not
stir nor groan after he was smitten, but con|tinued
standing as before, bearing upon the
Table. There was no visible impression on
his body or clothes, only the sole of one of his
Shoes was rent from the upper Leather.
There were about twelve persons in the
Room; none else received any harm, only
one Woman (who is still living) was struck
upon the Head, which occasioned some deaf|ness
<PB N="76" REF="52">
ever since. The Fire on the House was
quenched by the seasonable help of Neigh|bours.</P>
<P><HI>Iuly</HI> 15. 1665. There were terrible cracks
of Thunder. An House in <HI>Boston</HI> was
struck by it, and the Dishes therein melted
as they stood on the Shelves, but no other
hurt done in the Town. Only Captain
<HI>Davenport</HI> (a Worthy Man, and one that had
in the <HI>Pequot</HI> War, ventured his life, and did
great service for the Countrey) then resi|ding
in the Castle where he commanded:
having that day wrought himself weary, and
thinking to refresh himself with sleep, was
killed with Lightning, as he lay upon his Bed
asleep. Several of the Souldiers in the
Castle were struck at the same time; but
God spared their lives. It has been an old
Opinion mentioned by <HI>Plutarch (sympos. lib.
4. q.</HI> 2.) that Men asleep are never smitten
with Lightning; to confirm which it has
been alledged, that one lying asleep, the
Lightning melted the Money in his Purse
without doing him any further harm: And
that a Cradle, wherein a Child lay sleeping,
was broken with the Lightning, and the
Child not hurt; And that the Arrows of
King <HI>Mithridates</HI> being near his Bed, were
burnt with Lightning, and yet himself being
<PB N="77" REF="52">
asleep received no hurt; but as much of all
this, may be affirmed of persons awake. And
this sad Example <HI>(Triste jaces lucis evitan|dumque
Bidental)</HI> of Captain <HI>Davenport,</HI>
whom the Lightning found and left asleep,
does confute the vulgar error mentioned.
And no doubt but that many the like Instan|ces
to this have been known in the World,
the Records whereof we have not. But
I proceed:</P>
<P><HI>Iune</HI> 23. 1666. In <HI>Marshfield,</HI> another
dismal Storm of Rain with Thunder and
Lightning hapned. There were then in the
house of <HI>Iohn Philips</HI> (he was Father of that
<HI>Iohn Philips</HI> who was slain by Lightning in
the year 1658.) fourteen persons; the Wo|man
of the house calling earnestly to shut
the Door, that was no sooner done, but an
astonishing Thunder-clap fell upon the house
rent the Chimney, and split the Door. All
in the house were struck. One of them
(who is still living) saith, that when he
came to himself, he saw the house full of
Smoke, and perceived a grievous smell of
Brimstone, and saw the fire ly scattered;
though whether that fire came from Heaven
or was violently hurled out of the Hearth, he
can give no account. At first he thought
<PB N="78" REF="53">
all the people present, except himself, had
been killed. But it pleased God to revive
most of them. Only three of them were
mortally wounded with Heavens Arrows,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Wife of <HI>Iohn Philips,</HI> and another
of his Sons a young Man about twenty
years old, and <HI>William Shertly,</HI> who had a
Child in his Arms, that received no hurt by
the Lightning when himself was slain. This
<HI>Shertly</HI> was at that time a sojourner in <HI>Iohn
Philips</HI> his house; having been a little before
burnt out of his own house. The Wife of
this <HI>Shertly</HI> was with Child and near her full
time, and struck down for dead at present,
but God recovered her, so that she received
no hurt, neither by fright nor stroke. Two
little Children sitting upon the edge of a Ta|ble,
had their lives preserved, though a Dog
which lay behind them under the Table was
killed.</P>
<P>In the same year (in the latter end of
<HI>May) Samuel Ruggles</HI> of <HI>Rocksborough</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI>
going with a loaden Cart, was
struck with Lightning. He did not hear the
Thunder-clap, but was by the force of the
Lightning e're he was aware, carried over his
Cattle about ten foot distance from them.
Attempting to rise up he found that he was
not able to stand upon his right Leg, for his
<PB N="79" REF="53">
right foot was become limber, and would
bend any way, feeling as if it had no bone in
it, nevertheless, he made a shift with the use
of one leg to get to his Cattle (being an
Horse and two Oxen) which were all killed
by the Lightning. He endeavoured to take
off the Yoak from the neck of one of the
Oxen, but then he perceived that his thumb
and two fingers in one hand were stupified
that he could not stir them; they looked like
cold clay, the blood clear gone out of that
part of his hand. But by rubbing his woun|ded
leg and hand, blood and life came into
them again. As he came home pulling off
his Stocking, he found that on the inside of
his right Leg (which smarted much) the
hair was quite burnt off, and it looked red.
Just over his Ankle his Stocking was singed
on the inside, but not on the outside, and
there were near upon twenty marks about as
big as pins heads, which the Lightning had
left thereon. Likewise the Shoe on his left
foot, was by the Lightning struck off his
foot, and carried above two Rods from him.
On the upper leather at the heel of the Shoe,
there were five holes burnt through it, bigger
than those which are made with Duck Shot.
As for the Beasts that were slain, the hair
upon their skins was singed, so that one might
<PB N="80" REF="54">
perceive that the Lightning had run winding
and turning strangely upon their bodies, lea|ving
little marks no bigger then Corns of
Gun-powder behind it. There was in the
Cart a Chest which the Lightning pierced
through, as also through a quire of Paper and
twelve Napkins, melting some pewter dishes
that were under them.</P>
<P>At another time in <HI>Rocksborough,</HI> a Thunder
Storm hapning, broke into the house of <HI>Tho|mas
Bishop,</HI> striking off some Clapboards, split|ting
two Studs of the end Spar, and running
down by each side of the Window, where
stood a Bed with three Children in it. Over
the head of the Bed were three Guns and a
Sword, which were so melted with the Light|ning
that they began to run. It made a
hole through the floor, and coming into a
lower room it beat down the shutter of the
Window, and running on a shelf of Pewter,
it melted several Dishes there; and descend|ing
lower, it melted a Brass Morter, and a
Brass Kettle. The Children in the Bed
were wonderfully preserved: for a Lath at
the corner of it was burnt, and Splinters flew
about their Clothes and Faces, and there was
not an hands breadth between them and the
fire, yet received they no hurt.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="54">
On the 18 of <HI>May</HI> (being the Lords day)
<HI>A. D.</HI> 1673. The People at <HI>Wenham</HI> (their
worthy Pastor Mr. <HI>Antipas Newman</HI> being
lately dead) prevailed with the Reverend
Mr. <HI>Higginson</HI> of <HI>Salem,</HI> to spend that Sab|bath
amongst them. The afternoon Sermon
being ended, he with several of the Town
went to Mr. <HI>Newman</HI> his House; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">lest
they were in discourse there, about the word
and works of God, a Thunder storm arose.
After a while a smart Clap of Thunder broke
upon the House, and especially into the Room
where they were sitting, and discoursing to|gether;
It did for the present deafen them
all, filling the Room with smoke, and a
strong smell as of Brimstone. With
the Thunder-clap, came in a Ball of Fire
as big as the Bullet of a great Gun, which
suddenly went up the Chimney, as also the
Smoke did. This Ball of Fire was seen at the
feet of <HI>Richard Goldsmith,</HI> who sat on a
Leather Chair, next the Chimney, at which
instant he fell off the Chair on the Ground.
As soon as the Smoke was gone, some in the
room endeavoured to hold him up, but found
him dead; also the Dog that lay under the
Chair was found stone dead, but not the least
hurt done to the Chair. All that could be
perceived by the Man, was, that the hair of
<PB N="82" REF="55">
head near one of his Ears was a little singed.
There were seven or eight in that room, and
more in the next; yet (through the merciful
providence of God) none else had the least
harm. This <HI>Richard Goldsmith,</HI> who
was thus slain, was a Shoemaker by Trade, be|ing
reputed a good Man for the main; but
had blemished his Christian Profession by
frequent breaking of his promise, it being
too common with him (as with too many
Professors amongst us) to be free and for|ward
in engaging but backward in perform|ing.
Yet this must further be added, that
half a year before his Death, God gave him
a deep sence of his Evils, that he made it his
business not only that his peace might be
made with God, but with Men also, unto
whom he had given just offence. He went
up and down bewailing his great sin in pro|mise-breaking;
and was become a very con|scientious
and lively Christian, promoting
holy and edifying Discourses, as he had occa|sion.
At that very time when he was struck
dead, he was speaking of some passages in
the Sermon he had newly heard, and his last
words were, <HI>blessed be the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>In the same year, on the 21. of <HI>Iune,</HI> be|ing
Saturday in the afternoon; another
<PB N="83" REF="55">
Thunder-storm arose; during which Storm
<HI>Iosiah Walton</HI> (the youngest Son of Mr.
<HI>William Walton</HI> late Minister of <HI>Marble-head)</HI>
was in a Ketch coming in from Sea, and be|ing
before the Harbours mouth, the Wind
suddenly shifted to the <HI>Northward;</HI> a violent
Gust of Wind coming down on the Vessel,
the Seamen concluded to hand their Sails,
<HI>Iosiah Walton</HI> got upon the Main-yard to ex|pedite
the matter, and foot down the Sail;
when there hapned a terrible flash of Light|ning,
which breaking forth out of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d,
struck down three Men who were on the
Deck, without doing them any hurt; but
<HI>Iosiah Walton</HI> being (as was said) on the
Main-yard, the Lightning shattered his Thigh|bone
all in pieces, and did split and shiver the
Main-mast of the Vessel, and scorcht the
Rigging. <HI>Iosiah Walton</HI> falling down upon
the Deck, his Leg was broken short off. His
Brother being on the Deck, did (with o|thers)
take him up, and found him alive,
but sorely scorched and wounded. They
brought him on shore to his Mothers House.
At first he was very sensible of his case; and
took leave of his Friends, giving himself to
a serious preparation for another World. His
Relations used all means possible for his re|covery;
though he himself told them he was a

dead man, and the use of means would but
put him to more misery. His Bones were so
shattered, that it was not possible for the Art
of Man to reduce them; Also, the violent
heat of the weather occasioned a Gangrene.
In this misery he continued until the next
Wednesday morning; and then departed this
life; he was an hopeful young-man.</P>
<P>In the Year 1678. on the 29<HI>^t^h.</HI> of <HI>Iune,</HI>
at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI> A Thunder-clap
with Lightning broke into the next house
to the Colledge. It tore away and shattered
into pieces a considerable quantity of the
Tyle on the Roof thereof. In one Room
there then hapned to be the Wife of <HI>Iohn
Benjamin</HI> (Daughter to <HI>Thomas Swetman,</HI> the
Owner of the House) who then had an In|fant
about two Moneths old in her Arms;
also another Woman. They were all of them
struck; the Child being by the force of the
Lightning carried out of the Mothers Arms,
and thrown upon the Floor some distance
from her. The Mother was at first thought
to be dead, but God restored her, though she
lost the use of her Limbs for some considera|ble
time. Her feet were singed with the
Lightning, and yet no sign thereof appearing
on her Shoes. Also the Child and the other
<PB N="85" REF="58">
Woman recovered. In the next room were
seven or eight persons who received no hurt.
It was above a quarter of an hour before
they could help the persons thus smitten, for
the room was so full of Smoke (smelling like
Brimstone) that they could not see them.
Some Swine being near the Door as the
Lightning fell, were thrown into the House,
and seemed dead awhile, but afterwards came
to life again. A Cat was killed therewith.
A Pewter Candlestick standing upon a joynt-stool;
some part of it was melted and carried
away before the Lightning, and stuck in the
Chamber floor over head, like Swan shot, and
yet the Candlestick it self was not so much as
shaken off from the Stool whereon it stood.</P>
<P><HI>Iune</HI> 12. 1680. There was an amazing
Thunder-storm at <HI>Hampton</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI>
The Lightning fell upon the House of Mr.
<HI>Ioseph Smith,</HI> strangely shattering it in divers
places. His Wife (the Grand-Daughter of that
Eminent Man of God, Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> who was
the famous Teacher of the Church of Christ,
first in Old, and then in New <HI>Boston)</HI> lay as
dead for the present; being struck down with
the Lightning, near the Chimney, yet God
mercifully spared and restored her. But the
said <HI>Smith</HI> his Mother (a gracious Woman)
<PB N="86" REF="59">
was strvck dead and never recovered again.</P>
<P>Besides all these which have been menti|oned,
one or two in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony, and
four Persons dwelling in the Northern parts
of this Countrey, were smitten with the fire
of God, about sixteen years ago; the cir|cumstances
of which Providences (though
very Remarkable) I have not as yet recei|ved
from those that were acquainted there|with;
and therefore cannot here publish
them. Also, some Remarkables about Thun|der
hapned the last year.</P>
<P>A Reverend Friend in a Neighbour Colo|ny,
in a Letter bearing <HI>August</HI> 3. 1682. Wri|teth
thus;</P>
<P>We have had of late great Storms of Rain
and Wind, and some of Thunder and Lightning,
whereby Execution has been done, though with
sparing mercy to Men: Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> his House in
<HI>New-Haven,</HI> was broken into by the Light|ning,
and strange work made in one Room espe|cially,
in which one of his Children had been but
a little before. This was done <HI>June</HI> 8. 1682.
A little after which at <HI>Norwalk,</HI> there were nine
working Oxen smitten dead at once, within a
small compass of Ground. The next Moneth at
<HI>Greenwich,</HI> there were seven Swine and a Dog
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">illed with the Lightning, very near a dwelling
<PB N="87" REF="59">
House, where a Family of Children (their Pa|rents
not at home when Lightning hapned) were
much frighted, but received no other hurt: what
are these but warning pieces, shewing that Mens
lives may go next? <HI>Thus he,</HI></P>
<P>I proceed now to give an account of some
late Remarkables about Thunder and Light|ning,
wherein several Vessels at Sea were
concerned.</P>
<P><HI>Iuly</HI> 17. 1677. A Vessel whereof Mr. <HI>Tho|mas
Berry</HI> was Master, set Sail from <HI>Boston</HI> in
<HI>New-England,</HI> Bound for the Island of <HI>Ma|dera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI>
About 3. <HI>h. P. M.</HI> being half way be|tween
<HI>Cape Cod</HI> and <HI>Brewsters Islands,</HI> they were
becalmed; and they perceived a Thunder-shower
arising in the <HI>North-Northwest.</HI> The
Master ordered all their Sails (except their
two Courses) to be furled. When the shower
drew near to them, they had only the fore|sail
abroad; all the Men were busie in lash|ing
fast the Long-boat; The Master was
walking upon the Deck, and as he came near
the Main-mast, he beheld something very
black fly before him, about the bigness of a
small Mast, at the Larboard side; and imme|diately
he heard a dreadful and amazing
noise, not like a single Canon, but as if great
<PB N="88" REF="60">
Armies of Men had been firing one against
another; presently upon which the Master
was struck clear round, and fell down for
dead upon the Deck, continuing so for about
seven minutes; but then he revived, having
his hands much burnt with the Lightning.
The Ship seemed to be on fire; and a very
great Smoke having a Sulphurous smell came
from between the Decks; so that no man
was able to stay there, for more than half an
hour after this surprizing Accident hapned.
The Main-mast was split from the Top-gal|lant-mast
head to the lower Deck. The
Partners of the Pump were struck up at the
Star-board side, and one end of two Cabbins
staved down betwixt Decks. Two holes
were made in one of the Pumps about the
bigness of two Musquet Bullets. They were
forced to return to <HI>Boston</HI> again, in order to
the fitting of the Vessel with a new Mast.
Through the mercy of the most high, no
person in the Vessel received any hurt, be|sides
what hath been expressed. Yet it is <HI>Re|markable</HI>
that the same day, about the same
time, two Men in or near <HI>Wenham</HI> were kil|led
with Lightning, as they sat under a tree
in the Woods.</P>
<P>On <HI>Iune</HI> the sixth <HI>A. D.</HI> 1682. A Ship cal|led
<PB N="89" REF="60">
the <HI>Iamaica Merchant,</HI> Captain <HI>Ioseph
Wild</HI> Commander, being then in the Gulph
of <HI>Florida,</HI> Lat. 27. <HI>gr.</HI> about 1 <HI>h. P. M.</HI> was
surprized with an amazing Thunder shower;
the Lightning split the Main-mast, and
knocked down one of the Sea-men, and set
the Ship on fire between Decks, in several
places. They used utmost endeavour to ex|tinguish
the fire, but could not do it; seeing
they were unable to overcome those Flames,
they betook themselves to their Boat. The
fire was so furious between the Cabbin and the
Deck in the Steeridge, that they could not go
to the relief of each other, insomuch that a
Man and his Wife were parted. The Man
leaped over-board into the Sea, and so swam
to the Boat: his Wife and a Child were taken
out of a Gallery Window into the Boat.
Three Men more were saved by leaping out
of the Cabbin Window. There were aboard
this Vessel which Heaven thus set on fire,
thirty four persons; yet all escaped with their
lives: For the gracious providence of God
so ordered, as that Captain <HI>Iohn Bennet</HI> was
then in company, who received these distres|sed
and astonished Creatures into his Ship:
so did they behold the Vessel burning, until
about 8 <HI>h. P. M.</HI> when that which remained
sunk to the bottom of the Sea. The Master
<PB N="90" REF="61">
with several of the Seamen were by Captain
<HI>Bennet</HI> brought safe to <HI>New-England,</HI> where
they declared how wonderfully they had been
delivered from Death which God both by fire
and water had threatned them with.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 16. 1682, 3. A ship whereof <HI>Robert
Luist</HI> is Master being then at Sea (bound for
<HI>New-England)</HI> in <HI>Lat. 27. gr.</HI> about 2. <HI>h. A. M&punc;</HI>
it began to Thunder and Lighten. They be|h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ld
three <HI>Corpusants</HI> (as Mariners call them)
on the Yards: The Thunder grew fiercer,
and thicker than before. Suddenly their Ves|sel
was filled with Smoke, and the smell of
Brimstone, that the poor men were terrified
with the apprehension of their Ships be|ing
on fire. There came down from the
Clouds a stream or flame of Fire as big as the
Ships Mast, which fell on the middle of the
Deck, where the Mate was standing, but
then was thrown flat upon his back with
three Men more that were but a little distance
from him. They that were yet untouched,
thought, not only that their fellow Mariners
had been struck dead, but their Deck broken
in pieces by that blow, whose sound seemed
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o them to exceed the report of many great
Guns fired off at once. Some that were less
dangerously hurt, made an Out-cry that their
<PB N="91" REF="61">
legs were scalded; but the Mate lay speech|less
and senseless. When he began to come
to himself, he made sad complaints of a bur|den
lying upon his back. When Day came,
they perceived their Main-top-mast was split&punc;
and the Top-sail burnt. The Lightning
seemed like small coals of fire blown over|board.</P>
<P>There is one <HI>Remarkable</HI> more about <HI>Thun|der</HI>
and <HI>Lightning,</HI> which I am lately informed
of by persons concerned therein; some cir|cumstances
in the Relation being as wonder|full,
as any of the preceding particulars&punc;
Thus it was: On <HI>Iuly</HI> 24. in the Year 1681&punc;
The Ship called <HI>Albemarl</HI> (whereof Mr. <HI>Ed|ward
Lad</HI> was then Master) being an hun|dred
leagues from <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> in <HI>Lat.</HI> 48. about
3 <HI>h. P. M.</HI> met with a Thunder Storm. The
<HI>Lightning</HI> burnt the Main-top-sail, split the
Main-cap in pieces, rent the Mast all along.
There was in special one dreadful Clap of
Thunder, the report bigger than of a great
Gun, at which all the Ships Company were
amazed; then did there fall something from
the Clouds upon the stern of the Boat, which
broke into many small parts; split one of the
Pumps, the other Pump much hurt also. It
was a Bituminous matter, smelling much like
<PB N="92" REF="62">
fired Gun-powder. It continued burning in
the stern of the Boat, they did with Sticks
dissipate it, and poured much Water on it,
and yet they were not able by all that
they could do to extinguish it, until such time
as all the matter was consumed. But the
strangest thing of all, is yet to be mentioned.
When night came, observing the Stars, they
perceived that their Compasses were changed.
As for the Compass in the <HI>Biddikil,</HI> the North
point was turned clear South. There were
two other Compasses unhung in the <HI>Locker,</HI>
in the Cabbin. In one of which the North
point stood South, like that in the <HI>Biddikil;</HI>
as for the other, the North point stood West.
So that they Sailed by a Needle whose Pola|rity
was quite changed. The Seamen were
at first puzled how to work their Vessel right,
considering that the South point of their
Compass was now become North, but after a
little use, it was easie to them. Thus did they
Sail a thousand Leagues. As for the Compass
wherein the Lightning had made the Needle
to point Westward, since it was brought to
<HI>New-England</HI> the Glass being broke, it has by
means of the Air coming to it, wholly lost
its virtue. One of those Compasses which
had quite changed the Polarity from North
to South, is still extant in <HI>Boston;</HI> and at pre|sent
<PB N="93" REF="62">
in my custody. The North point of the
Needle doth remain fixed to this day, as it
did immediately after the Lightning caused an
alteration. The natural reason of which
may be enquired into in the next Chapter:
But before I pass to that, it may be, it will be
grateful to the Reader, for me here to com|memorate
some parallel Instances, which
have lately hapned in other parts of the
World, unto which I proceed, contenting my
self with one or two Examples, reserving o|thers
for the subsequent Chapter; where we
shall have further occasion to take notice of
them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Authors Ephemeridum Medico-Physica|rum
Germanicarum,</HI> have informed the World,
that on <HI>August</HI> 14. 1669. it Thundred and
Lightned as if Heaven and Earth would come
together. And at the house of a Gentleman
who lived near <HI>Bergen,</HI> the fiery Lightning
flashed through four inner rooms at once,
entring into a Beer Cellar, with its force it
threw down the Earthen Vessels, with the
Windows and Doors where it came: but the
Tin and Iron Vessels were partly melted, and
partly burnt with black spots remaining on
them. Where it entred the Cellar, the Bar|rels
were removed out of their right places;
where it went out, it left the Taps shaking.
<PB N="94" REF="63">
In one room the binding was taken off from
the back of a Bible, and the Margin was ac|curately
cut by the Lightning without hurt|ing
the Letters, as if it had been done by the
hands of some Artists: beginning at the <HI>Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">elation,</HI>
and (which is wonderful) ending
with the twelfth Chapter of 1 Epistle to the
<HI>Corinthians,</HI> which Chapter fell in course to
be expounded in publick the next Lords day.
Six Women sitting in the same Chimney
filled with a Sulphurous and choaking Mist,
that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> could scarce breathe; not far from
the Bed of a Woman that was then lying in,
were struck down, the hangings of the room
burnt, and the Mother of the Woman in
Child-bed lay for dead at present; but after
a while, the other recovering their sences,
examined what hurt was done to the Woman
thought to be dead: her Kerchief was burnt
as if it had been done with Gun-powder;
she had about her a silver Chain, which was
melted and broke into five parts: her under
Garments were not so much as singed; but
just under her Paps she was very much burnt.
After she came to her self, she was very sen|sible
of pain in the place where the Light|ning
had caused that wound. To lenifie
which Womens Milk was made use of. But
Blisters arising, the dolour was increased,
<PB N="95" REF="63">
until a skilful <HI>Physician</HI> prescribed this Un|guent.

<P>By the same Authors, it is also Related,
that in <HI>Iune A. D.</HI> 1671. an house was struck
with Lightning in four places, in some places
the Timber was split, and in other places had
holes made in it, as if bored through with an
Awger, but no impression of fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> any
where to be seen. A Girl fifteen years old,
sitting in the Chimney, was struck down and
lay for dead, the space of half an hour. And
it is probable, that she had never recovered,
had not an able Physician been sent for, who
viewing her, perceived that the Clothes a|bout
her Breast were made to look blewish
by the Lightning: It had also caused her
Paps to look fiery and blackish, as if they had
been scorched with Gun-powder. Under
her Breast the Lightning had left creases, a
cross her body, of a brownish colour. Also
some creases made by the Lightning as broad
as ones finger run along her left Leg reach|ing
to her Foot. The Physician caused two
spoonfuls of <HI>Apoplectick Water</HI> to be poured
down her throat, upon which she instantly
<PB N="96" REF="64">
revived, complaining of a great heat in her
Jaws and much pain, in the places hurt by the
Lightning. Half a drachm of <HI>Pulvis Bezo|articus
Anglicus,</HI> in the water of sweet Cher|vil
was given to her, which caused a plenti|ful
sweat, whereby the pain in her Jaws was
dimi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ished. Being still feave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ish, an emul|sion
made with Poppy seed, Millet, Carduus
Benedictus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was made use of, upon
which the Patient had ease and recovered. It
appears by this as well as other instances, that
great care should be had of those that are
Thunde-struck, that they be not given up
for quite dead, before all means be used in
order to their being revived. <HI>Paulus Zac|chias
in Questionibus Medicis</HI> giveth Rules
whereby it may be known whether per|sons
smitten with Lightning be dead, past all
recovery or no. And the History put forth
by <HI>Iaccbus Iavellus</HI> in an Epistle emitted
with his <HI>Medicinae Compendium,</HI> describes the
cure of persons struck with Lightning. I
have not my self seen those Books; but who|so
shall see cause to obtain and consult them,
will I suppose find therein things worth their
reading and consideration. Something to
this purpose I find in the <HI>Scholion</HI> on the <HI>Germ.

none more awful (to my Remembrance)
than that which hapned <HI>A. D.</HI> 1546. when
<HI>Meckelen</HI> (a principal City in <HI>Brabant)</HI> was
set on fire, and suffered a fearful Conflagra|tion
by Lightning: So it was, that at the ve|ry
time. when this Thunder-Storm hapned,
an Inn-keeper (whose Name was <HI>Croes)</HI> had
in his house some Guests, who were playing
at Cards. The Inn-keeper going into his
Wine-Celler to fetch Drink for his merry
Guests, at that moment the furious Tempest
plucked up the house and carried it a good
way off. Every one of the Men that were
playing at Cards were found dead with their
Cards in their hands; only the Inn-keeper
himself, being in the Wine-Cellar (which
was arched) escaped with his Life.</P>
<P>This brings to mind a strange passage re|lated
by <HI>Cardan (de variet Lib.</HI> 8. C. 43.) who
saith, that eight men sitting down together
under an Oak, as they were at Supper, a flash

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Some Philosophical Meditations. Concerning

Of the Nature and Wonderful Effects of Light|ning.
That Thunder-Storms are often caused by
Satan; and sometimes by good Angels. Thun|der
is the Voice of God, and therefore to be
dreaded. All Places in the habitable World are
subject to it more or less. No Amulets can pre|serve
men from being hurt thereby. The misera|ble
estate of Wicked Men upon this account,
and the happiness of the Righteous, who may be
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">ve all disquieting fears, with respect unto such
terrible Accidents.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving thus far Related many <HI>Remarka|ble
Providences,</HI> which have hapned in
these goings down of the Sun; and some of
the particulars, (especially in the last Cha|pter)
being Tragical Stories: The Reader
must give me leave upon this occasion a little
to divert and recreate my mind, with some
Philosophical Meditations; and to conclude
with a Theological Improvement thereof.
There are Wonders in the Works of Crea|tion
as well as Providence, the reason where|of
the most knowing amongst Mortals, are
<PB N="100" REF="66">
not able to comprehend. <HI>Dost thou know the
ballancings of the Clouds, the wondrous works of
him who is perfect in knowledge?</HI> I have not
yet seen any who give a satisfactory reason
of those strange Fountains in <HI>New Spain,</HI>
which Ebb and Flow with the Sea, though
far from it; and which fall in Rainy Wea|ther,
and rise in dry; or concerning that Pit
near St. <HI>Bartholmew's</HI> into which if one cast a
stone though never so small, it makes a noise
as great and terrible as a clap of Thunder.
It is no difficult thing to produce a World of
Instances, concerning which the usual An|swer
is, an <HI>occult Quality</HI> is the cause of this
strange operation, which is only a Fig-lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
whereby our common Philosophers seek to
hide their own ignorance. Nor may we
(with <HI>Erastus)</HI> deny that there are marvelous
<HI>Sympathies</HI> and <HI>Antipathies</HI> in the natures of
things. We know that the Horse does abo|minate
the Camel; the mighty Elephant is
afraid of a Mouse: And they say that the
Lion, who scorneth to turn his back upon the
stoutest Animal, will tremble at the Crowing
of a Cock. Some Men also have strange
<HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tipathies</HI> in their natures against that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ort
of Food which others love and live upon.
I have read of one that could not endure to
eat either Bread or Flesh. Of another that
<PB N="101" REF="66">
fell into a Swoonding fit at the smell of a
Rose. Others would do the like at the smell
of Vineger, or at the sight of an Eel or a
Frog. There was a Man that if he did hear
the sound of a Bell, he would immediately
die away. Another if he did happen to hear
any one sweeping a Room, an inexpressible
horror would sieze upon him. Another if
he heard one whetting a Knife his Gumms
would fall a bleeding. Another was not able
to behold a Knife that had a sharp point,
without being in a strange agony. <HI>Quercetus</HI>
speaketh of one that died as he was sitting
at the Table, only because an Apple was
brought into his sight. There are some who
if a Cat accidentally come into the Room,
though they neither see it, nor are told of it,
will presently be in a Sweat and ready to die
away. There was lately one living in <HI>Stow-Market,</HI>
that when ever it Thundred would
fall into a violent Vomiting, and so continue
until the Thunder-storm was over. A
Woman had such an <HI>Antipathy</HI> against Cheese
that if she did but eat a piece of Bread, cut
with a Knife, which a little before had cut
Cheese, it would cause a <HI>Deliquium,</HI> yet the
same Woman when she was with Child de|lighted
in no meat so much as in Cheese.
There was la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ely (I know not but that he
<PB N="102" REF="67">
may be living still) a Man that if Pork, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
any thing made of Swines flesh were brought
into the room, he would fall into a convul|sive
<HI>Sardonian Laughter;</HI> nor can he for his
heart leave as long as that object is before
him, so that if it should not be removed, he
would certainly laugh himself to death. It
is evident that the peculiar <HI>Antipathies</HI> of some
persons are caused by the imaginations of
their Parents. There was one that would
fall into a <HI>Syncope</HI> if either a Calves-head or a
Cabbage were brought near him. There
were <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">vi materni</HI> upon the <HI>Hypocondria</HI> of
this person, on his right side there was the
form of a Calves head, on his left side a
Cabbage imprinted there by the Imagi|nation
of his Longing Mother. Most
Wonderful is that which <HI>Libavius</HI> and others
report, concerning a Man that would be sur|prized
with a <HI>Lipothymy</HI> at the sight of his own
Son; nay, upon his approaching near unto
him, though he saw him not, for which some
assigned this reason, that the Mother when
she was with Child, used to feed upon such
Meats as were abominable to the Father
(concerning the rationality of this conjecture
see Sr. <HI>Kenelm Digby</HI>'s disco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">e of Bodies, <HI>P.</HI>
409, 410.) but others said that the Midwife
who b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ought him into the World was a
<PB N="103" REF="67">
Witch. Nor are the <HI>Sympathies</HI> in Nature
less Wonderful than the <HI>Antipathies.</HI> There
is a mutual Friendship between the <HI>Olive tree</HI>
and the <HI>Myrtle.</HI> There is a certain Stone
called <HI>Pantarbe</HI> which draws Gold unto it. So
does the <HI>Adamas</HI> hairs and twigs. The <HI>Sym|pathy</HI>
between the <HI>Load-stone</HI> and <HI>Iron,</HI> which
do mutually attract each other, is admirable.
There is no Philosopher but speaketh of this.
Some have published whole Treatises (both
profitable and pleasant) upon this Argument;
In special <HI>Gilbert, Ward, Cabeus, Kepler,</HI> and of
late <HI>Kircherus.</HI> I know many Fabulous things
have been related concerning the Load-stone
by inexperienced Philosophers, and so belie|ved
by many others, <HI>E. G.</HI> that <HI>Onions,</HI> or
<HI>Garlick,</HI> or <HI>Ointments</HI> will cause it to lose its
vertue. <HI>Iohnston,</HI> (and from him Dr. <HI>Brown</HI>
in his vulgar Errors) hath truly asserted the
contrary. Every one knoweth that the head
of a Needle touched therewith will continue
pointing towards the North Pole: so that
the <HI>Magnet</HI> leaveth an impression of its own
nature and vertue upon the Needle, causing
it to stand pointed as the <HI>Magnet</HI> it self doth:
The Loadstone it self is the hardest Iron;
and it is a thing known that such Mines are
naturally so (notwithstanding the Report of
one who saith, that lately in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> Load-stones
<PB N="104" REF="68">
were found otherwise) posited in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Earth. Just under the Line the Needle lieth
Parallel with the Horizon, but Sailing North
or South it begins to incline and increase ac|cording
as it approacheth to either Pole, and
would at last endeavour to erect it self,
whence some ascribe these strange effects to
the North Star, which they suppose to be ve|ry
magnetical. There is reason to believe
that the Earth is the great <HI>Magnet.</HI> Hence
(as Mr. <HI>Seller</HI> observes) when a Bar of Iron
has stood long in a Window, that end of it
which is next to the Earth will have the same
vertue which the Load-stone it self has. Some
place the first Meridian at the <HI>Azores,</HI> be|cause
there the Needle varies not: but the
like is to be said of some other parts of the
World; yea under the very same Meridian
in divers Latitudes there is a great variation as
to the pointing of the Needle. <HI>It is affirmed,
that between the shore of</HI> Ireland, France, Spain,
Guiny, <HI>and the</HI> Azores, <HI>the North point varies
towards the East, as some part of the</HI> Azores <HI>it
deflecteth not. On the other side of the</HI> Azores,
<HI>and this side of the</HI> Aequator, <HI>the North point of
the Needle wheeleth to the West; so that in the</HI>
Lat. 36. <HI>near the shore, the variation is about</HI> 11
gr. <HI>but on the other side of the</HI> Aequator <HI>it is
quite otherwise, for in</HI> Brasilia <HI>the South point
<PB N="105" REF="68">
varies</HI> 12 gr. <HI>unto the West, but Elongating from
the Coast of</HI> Brasilia <HI>toward the Shore of</HI> Africa
<HI>it varies Eastward, and arriving at the</HI> Cape
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">las Aquilas, <HI>it rests in the Meridian and
looketh neither way. Dr.</HI> Brown <HI>in he</HI> Psudo|doxia
Epidemica <HI>P. 63. does rationally suppose
that the cause of this variation may be the ine|quality
of the Earth variously disposed, and in|differently
mixed with the Sea. The Needle
driveth that way where the greater and most
powerful part of the Earth is placed. For
whereas on this side the Isles of</HI> Azores <HI>the
Needle varies Eastward, it may be occasioned by
that vast Tract,</HI> viz. Europe, Asia <HI>and</HI> Africa,
<HI>seated towards the East, and disposing the Needle
that way. Sailing further it</HI> veers <HI>its lilly to
the West, and regards that quarter wherein the
Land is nearer or greater; and in the same La|titude,
as it approacheth the shore augmenteth its
variation. Hence at</HI> Rome <HI>there is a less va|riation</HI>
(viz. <HI>but five degrees) than at</HI> London,
<HI>for on the west side of</HI> Rome <HI>are seated the great
Continents of</HI> France, Spain, Germany; <HI>but
unto</HI> England <HI>there is almost no Earth West,
but the whole extent of</HI> Europe <HI>and</HI> Asia <HI>lies
Eastward, and therefore at</HI> London <HI>the varia|tion
is</HI> 11 Degrees. <HI>Thus also, by reason of the
great Continent of</HI> Brasilia, <HI>the Needle deflects
towards the Land</HI> 12 Degrees&punc; <HI>but at the Straits
<PB N="106" REF="69">
of</HI> Magellan, <HI>where the Land is narrowed, and
the Sea on the other side, it varies but 5 or 6. So
because the Cape of</HI> De las Agullas <HI>hath Sea on
both sides near it, and other Land remote, and as
it were aequidistant from it, the Needle conforms
to the Meridian. In certain Creeks and Vallies
it proveth irregular; the reason whereof may be
some vigorous part of the Earth not far distant.</HI>
Thus D. <HI>Brown,</HI> whose arguings seem rati|onal.
Some have truly observed of <HI>Crocus
Martis</HI> or Steel corroded with Vineger, Sul|phur,
or otherwise, and after reverberated by
Fire, that the Load-stone will not at all at|tract
it: nor will it adhere, but ly therein
like Sand. It is likewise certain, that the fire
will cause the Load-stone to lose its vertue;
inasmuch as its Bituminous Spirits are there|by
evaporated. <HI>Porta</HI> (Lib. 7. Cap. 7.) saith
that he did to his great admiration see a Sul|phurous
flame brake out of the Load-stone
which being dissipated, the Stone lost it's at|tractive
vertue. Moreover, the Load-stone
by being put into the fire may be caused quite
to change its polarity. The truly Noble and
Honourable <HI>Robert Boyle</HI> Esq, many of whose
excellent Observations and experiments have
been advantagious, not only to the <HI>English</HI>
Nation but to the Learned World; in his
Book of the Usefulness of Experimental;
<PB N="107" REF="69">
Natural Philosophy, <HI>Page</HI> 15. hath these
words; <HI>Taking an Oblong Load-stone, and

but I could by refrigerating the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">me end, some|times

and on the contrary, the formerly southern Pole
become the northern. And this change was
wrought on the Load-stone, not only by cooling it
directly North and South, but by cooling it per|pendicularly:
that end of it which was conti|guous
to the Ground growing the Northern Pole
and so</HI> (according to the Laws Magnetical)
<HI>drawing to it the South end; and that which was
remotest from the contrary one: As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f indeed the

<HI>since its</HI> effluvium's <HI>are able in some cases to im|part

Thus far Mr. <HI>Boyle;</HI></P>
<P>Also D. <HI>Brown</HI> shews, that if we erect a
red hot Wire until it cool, then hang it up
with Wax and untwisted Silk where the low|er
end and that which cooled next the Earth
does rest, that is the Northern point. And if
a Wire be heated only at one end, according
as the end is cooled upwards or downwards,
it respectively requires a verticity. He also
observes, if a Load-stone be made red hot in
the fire, it amits the magnetical vigor it had
before, and acquireth another from the Earth,
in its refrigeration, for that part which cool|eth
next the Earth will acquire the respect of
the North; the experiment whereof he made
in a Load-stone of parallelogram or long
square figure, wherein only inverting the ex|treams
as it came out of the fire, he altered
the Poles or faces thereof at pleasure. Unto
some such reason as this, must the wonderful
change occasioned by the Lightning in the
Compasses of Mr. <HI>Lad</HI>'s Vessel be ascribed:
probably the heat of the Lightning caused
the Needle to lose its vertue, and the Com|pass
in the Bidikle might stand pointed to the
South, and that unhung in the Locker to the
West, when they grew cold again, and ac|cordingly
<PB N="109" REF="70">
continue pointing so ever after.</P>
<P>There is also that which is very mysterious
and beyond humane Capacity to compre|hend,
in Thunder and Lightning. <HI>The Thun|der
of his Power, who can understand?</HI> Also,
<HI>Can any understand the spreadings of the Clouds,
or the noise of his Tabernacle?</HI> Hence <HI>Elihu</HI>
said (some Interpreters think there was a
Thunder-storm at the very instant when
those words were spoken) in <HI>Iob</HI> 37. 5.
<GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>He Thundreth marveils.</HI> It
is indeed manifest that these wonderful Me|teors
are generated out of a Nitrous and Sul|phurous
Matter. Hence it is commonly out
of dark and thick Clouds that Hail and coals
of Fire break forth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 18. 11, 12. The
Scent which the Lightning useth to leave be|hind
it, in places where it falls, is a suf|ficient
evidence of its being of a Sulphurous
nature. Nay the persons (as well as places) smit|ten
there with have sometimes smelt strong of
Brimstone. Two years ago there was a Ship
riding at Anchor in a place in <HI>France;</HI> and a
furious Tempest suddenly arising, the Main-Mast
wes split in pieces with a Clap of Thun|der;
the Pendant on the top of the Main-Top-Mast
was burnt to Ashes, twelve Men
were beat upon the Deck, five of which lay
<PB N="110" REF="71">
for dead a considerable time, no Pulse or
Breath being perceived, their Eyes and Teeth
immovable, yet had they no visible wound,
only an intolerable smell of Brimstone; a|bout
half an hour after by rubbing and force|ing
open their Mouths, and pouring down
some Cordials, they recovered. At the same
time six others were miserably burnt, their
flesh being scorched, yet their Garments not
so much as singed; their skin much disco|loured.
See Mr. <HI>Burton</HI>'s Miracles of Na|ture,
<HI>Page</HI> 181.</P>
<P>Likewise, <HI>August</HI> 23. 1682. A Man walk|ing
in the Field near <HI>Darkin</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> was
struck with a Clap of Thunder. One
who was near him, ran to take him up, but
found him dead, and his body exceeding hot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
and withal smelling so strong of Sulphur that
he was forced to let him ly a considerable
time ere he could be removed. It is report|ed,
that sometimes Thunder and Lightning
has been generated out of the Sulphurous and
Bituminous matter which the fiery Mountain
<HI>Aetna</HI> hath cast forth, We know that when
there is a mixture of Nitre, Sulphur, and un|slaked
Lime, Water will cause fire to break
out. And when unto Nitre Brimstone is
added, a Report is caused thereby. And un|questionably,
<PB N="111" REF="71">
<HI>Nitre</HI> is a special ingredient in
the matter of Thunder and Lightning; This
we may gather from the descension of the
flame, which descends not only obliquely but
perpendicularly, and that argues it does so
not from any external force, but naturally<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Mr. <HI>William Clark</HI> in his natural History of
Nitre, observes that if the quantity of an ounce
be put in a fire-shovel, and a live coal put upon
it, the fire-shovel in the bottom will be red
hot, and burn through whatever is under it;
which demonstrates that this sort of fire does
naturally burn downwards, when as all other
fires do naturally ascend. For this cause
<HI>Stella cadens</HI> is rationally concluded to be a
Nitrous Substance; the like is to be affirmed
of the Lightning. Hence also is its terrible
and irresistable force. The Nitre in Gun|powder
is as the aforesaid Author expresseth
it <HI>Anima Pyrii Pulveris,</HI> Sulphur without <HI>Salt
Peter</HI> has no powerful expulsion with it. The
discharging great pieces of Ordnance is f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tly
called <HI>Artificial Thundring and Lightning,</HI> since
thereby Men do in a moment blow up Hou|ses,
beat down Castles, batter Mountains in
pieces. So that there is nothing in nature
does so admirably and Artificially resemble
the Thunder and Lightning, both in respect
of the Report, and the terrible, and sudden
<PB N="112" REF="72">
and amazing execution done thereby:
<HI>Flammas Iovis &amp; sonitus imitatu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Olympi:</HI>
Hence as those that are shot with a Bullet do
not hear the Gun, being struck before the
report cometh to their Ears; so is it usually
with them that are Thunder-struck, the light|ning
is upon them before the noise is heard.
Men commonly tremble at the dreadful crack
when as, if they hear any thing, the danger
useth to be past as to that particular Thun|der-clap;
though another may come and kill
them before they hear it. The Nitre in the
Lightning may likewise be esteemed the na|tural
cause of its being of so penetrating
and burning a nature. For there is not the
like fiery substance in the World again as
Nitre is. Many have been of the Opinion
that there is a Bolt or Stone de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cending with
the Thunder, but that's a vulgar Error, The
<HI>Fulmen</HI> or <HI>Thunder-bolt</HI> is the same with the
Lightning, being a Nitro-sulphurious Spirit.
It must needs be a more subtile and spiritual
body than any Stone is of, that shall penetrate
so as these Meteors do. Its true that our

It is possible that not only Sulphurous and Bi|tuminous
but stony substances may be gene|rated
in the Clouds with the Lightning. <HI>George
Agricola</HI> writeth that near <HI>Lurgea,</HI> a mass of
Iron being fifty pound in weight, fell from
the Clouds, which some attempted to make
Swords of, but the fire could not melt it, nor
hammers bring it into form.</P>
<P>In the Year 1492. At <HI>Ensishemium,</HI> a stone
of three hundred pound weight fell from the
Clouds, which is kept as a Monument in the
Temple there. And in 1581, A Stone came
out of the Clouds in <HI>Thuringia,</HI> which was
so hot that it could not be touched, with
which one might strike fire as with a Flint.
There is now to be seen at <HI>Dresden</HI> a Stone
which descended out of a Cloud; and is re|served
amongst the <HI>Admiranda</HI> belonging to
the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Saxony:</HI> some lately living were

therewith, and a considerable mass of Mineral
matter, in tast like <HI>Vitriol,</HI> being pondrous and
friable, having also metallick sparks like Gold
intermixed. That which is by some called
the <HI>Rain-stone</HI> or <HI>Thunder-bolt,</HI> was by the An|tients
termed <HI>Ceraunia,</HI> because of the smell
like that of an Horn when put into the fire,
which does attend it. Learned <HI>Gesner.</HI> (who
in respect of his vast Knowledge in the
works of God, may be called the <HI>Solomon</HI> of
the former age) saith that a Gentleman
gave him one of those Stones, supposing it to
be a Thunder-bolt, and that it was five digits
in length, and three in breadth. This sort o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Stone is usually in form like unto an Iron
Wedge, and has an hole quite through it.
<HI>Ioh. de Laet</HI> in his Treatise <HI>de Gemmis Lib.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

reports that many persons worthy of credit,

<P>The Effects produced by the Lightning
<PB N="115" REF="73">
are exceeding marvelous, sometimes Gold,
Silver, Brass, Iron has been melted thereby,
when the things wherein they have been
kept, received no hurt; yea, when the Wax
on the Bags which contained them, has not
been so much as melted. Liquors have been
thereby exhausted out of Vessels, when the
Vessels themselves remained untouched: And
(which is more wonderful) when the Cask has
been broken by the Lightning, the Wine has
remained as it were included in a skin, with|out
being spilt; the reason whereof <HI>Sennertus</HI>
supposeth to be, in that the heat of the Light|ning
did condense the exterior parts of the
Wine. It is also a very strange thing, which
Histories report concerning <HI>Marcia</HI> (a <HI>Ro|man
Princess)</HI> that the Child in her body was
smitten and killed with Lightning, and yet
the Mother received no hurt in her own Bo|dy.
It is hard to give a clear and satisfactory
Reason why if a piece of Iron be laid upon
the Cask it prevents the Thunder from mar|ring
the Wine contained therein, and also
keeps Milk from turning. The <HI>Virtuosi</HI> of
<HI>France</HI> in their Philosophical Conferences
<HI>(vol. 2. P.</HI> 427.) suppose a Sympathy between
Iron and the gross vapors of Thunder and
Lightning. They say that which is com|monly
called the <HI>Thunder-bolt</HI> does sometimes
<PB N="116" REF="74">
resemble Steel, as it were to shew the corre|spondence
that there is between Iron and
Thunder: So that the Air being impregna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
by those noisome vapours which are of the
same nature with Iron, meeting with some
piece of it laid on a Vessel, is joyned to the
Iron by Sympathy, the Iron by its attractive
vertue receives them, and by its retentive re|tains
them, and by that means prevents the
effects. This conjecture is ingenious
Nor is it easie to give a solid Reason why the
Lightning should hurt one creature rather
than another. Naturalists observe that it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
<HI>Feles canes &amp; capras magis illorum obnoxios <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">

upon. When fire is set to a train of Gun|powder;
it will run accordingly straight or
crooked, upwards or downwards as the mat|ter
it feeds upon is disposed: So proportion|ably
here: but this is a Subject for ingenious
minds further to inquire into. It is moreover
difficult to determine how Men are killed
therewith, when no visible impression is made
upon their Bodies. Some think it is by
meer instantaneous suffocation of their A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|mal
spirits. That poysonful vapours do some|times<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="117" REF="74">
attend the Lightning is manifest. <HI>Se|neca</HI>
saith, that Wine which has been con|gealed
with the Lightning, after it is dissol|ved,
and in appearance returned to its pristine
state, it causeth the persons that shall drink
of it, either to die or become mad. Natu|ralists
observe, that venemous Creatures be|ing
struck with Lightning lose their poyson;
the reason of which may be, not only the
heat but the venome of those Vapours attra|cting
the poyson to themselves. And that
Vapors will kill in a moment is past doubt.
In the Philosophical transactions for the year
1665. <HI>(P.</HI> 44.) It is related that seven or eight
persons going down Stairs into a Coal-pit,
they fell down dead as if they had been shot:
There being one of them whose Wife was
informed that her Husband was stifled, she
went near to him without any inconvenience;
but when she went a little further, the Vapors
caused her instantly to fall down dead. And
it is famously known, concerning the Lake
<HI>Avernus</HI> in <HI>Campania,</HI> that if Birds attempt to
fly over it, the deadly vapors thereof kill them
in a moment. But the Lightning doth more
than meerly suffocate with mortiferous va|pors.
It sometimes penetrates the Brain, and
shrivels the Heart and Liver when nothing
does appear outwardly. And it does (as Dr.
<PB N="118" REF="75">
<HI>Goodwin</HI> in his lately published judicious Di|scourse
about the punishment of Sinners in
the other World <HI>(P.</HI> 44.) aptly expresseth)
<HI>lick up. the vital and animal spirits that run in
the Body, when yet the body it self remains un|burnt.</HI>
Those spirits are the <HI>Vinculum,</HI> the
tye of Union between the Soul and Body,
which the Lightning may consume without
so much as singing the body or cloaths there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Nevertheless, upon some it leaveth direful
marks, and breaketh their very bones in
pieces, and sometimes tears away the flesh
from the Bones. There are some Remarka|ble
Instances confirming this, published in the
Philosophical Transactions. Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI> in a
Letter written at <HI>Oxford, May.</HI> 12. 1666. gi|ving
an account of a very sad accident which
had then newly hapned there. </P>
<Q><P>He saith,
that two Schollars of <HI>Wadham</HI> Colledge,
being alone in a Boat (without a Water|man)
having newly thrust off from shore,
at <HI>Medley</HI> to come homewards, standing near
the head of the Boat, were presently with a
stroke of Thunder or Lightning, both struck
off out of the Boat into the Water, the one of
them stark dead, in whom though presently
taken out of the water (having been by relati|on
scarce a minute in it) there was not dis|cerned
any appearance of Life, sense or mo|tion:
<PB N="119" REF="75">
the other was stuck fast in the Mud
(with his feet downwards, and his upper
parts above water) like a Post not able to
help himself out; but besides a present asto|nying
or numness had no other hurt: but
was for the present so disturbed in his Senses
that he knew not how he came out of the
Boat, nor could remember either Thunder
or Lightning that did effect it: and was ve|ry
feeble and faint upon it (which though
presently put into a warm Bed) he had not
throughly recovered by the next night; and
whither since he have or no, I know not.
Others in another Boat, about ten or twen|ty
yards from these (as by their description
I estimate) felt a disturbance and shaking
in their Boat, and one of them had his
Chair struck from under him, and thrown
upon him, but had no hurt. These imme|diately
made up to the others, and (some
leaping into the Water to them) presently
drew them into the Boat or on shore; yet
none of them saw these two fall into the wa|ter
(not looking that way) but heard one
of them cry for help pesently upon the
stroke, and smelt a very strong stinking
smell in the Air; which, when I asked him
that told it me, what kind of stink? he said,
like such a smell, as is perceived upon the
<PB N="120" REF="76">
striking of Flints together.</P><P>He that was dead (when by putting into
(a warm Bed, and rubbing, and putting
strong Waters into his month, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> no Life
could be brought into him) was the next
morning brought to Town; where among
multitudes of others, who came to see; Dr.
<HI>Willis.</HI> Dr. <HI>Mellington,</HI> Dr. <HI>Lower,</HI> and myself,
with some others, went to view the
Corps, where we found no wound at all in
the skin; the face and neck swart and black,
but not more than might be ordinary, by
the setling of the blood: on the right side of
the Neck was a little blackish spott about an
inch long, and about a quarter of an inch
broad at the broadest, and was as if it had
been seared with a hot Iron: and as I re|member,
one somewhat bigger on the left
side of the neck below the ear. Streight
down the Breast, but towards the left side of
it, was a large place, about three quarters
of a foot in length, and about two inches in
breadth; in some places more, in some less
which was burnt and hard, like Leather
burnt with the fire, of a deep blackish red
colour, not much unlike the scorched skin
of a rosted Pig: and on the forepart of
the left Shoulder such another spot about as
big as a shilling; but that in the neck was
<PB N="121" REF="76">
blacker and seemed more seared. From
the top of the right shoulder, sloping down|wards
towards that place in his Breast, was a
narrow line of the like scorched skin; as
if somewhat had come in there at the neck,
and had run down to the breast and there
spread broader.</P><P>The Buttons of his Dublet were most of
them off, which some thought might have
been torn off with the blast, getting in at
the neck, and then bursting its way out, for
which the greatest presumption was (to me)
that besides four or five Buttons wanting
towards the bottom of the breast, there
were about half a dozen together clear off
from the bottom of the Collar downwards,
and I do not remember that the rest of the
buttons did seem to be near worn out, but
almost new. The Collar of his Doublet
just over the fore-part of the right Shoul|der
was quite broken asunder, cloth and

it: some part of it being quite struck
away, and from thence divers gashes every

some of them of a good length, almost
quite to the edges of the brim. And be|sides
these, one or two gashes more, which
did not communicate with that hole in the

inwards; not so much from the view of the
edges of those Gashes (from which there
was scarce any judgement to be made either
way) but because the lining was not torn, on|ly

1665, 6. When one Mr. <HI>Brooks</HI> of <HI>Hamp|shire</HI>
going from <HI>Winchester</HI> towards his
House near <HI>Andover,</HI> in very bad weather,
was himself slain by Lightning, and the
Horse he rode on under him. For about a
Mile from <HI>Winchester</HI> he was found with

his face beaten into the Ground, one Leg

his Cloathes all burnt off his back, not a
piece as big as an Hankerchief left intire,
and his Hair and all his body singed. With
the force that struck him down, his nose
was beaten into his face, and his Chin in|to
his Breast; where was a Wound cut al|most
as low as to his Navil; and his clothes
being as aforesaid torn, the pieces were so
scattered and consumed, that not enough to
fill the crown of a Hat could be found.
His Gloves were whole, but his hands in
them singed to the Bone. The Hip-bone
and Shoulder of his Horse burnt and brui|sed,
and his Saddle torn in little pieces.</P></Q>
<P>Very Remarkable also was that which hap|ned
forty five years ago at another place in
<HI>England,</HI> viz. <HI>Withycomb</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> where
on <HI>October 21. A. D.</HI> 1638. being Sabbath
day, whilest the People were attending the
publick Worship of God, a black Cloud
coming over the Church, there was suddenly
an amazing Clap of Thunder, and with it a
Ball of fire came in at the Window, where|by
the House was very much damnified, and
the People many of them struck down.
Some of the Seats in the body of the Church
<PB N="124" REF="78">
were turned upside down, yet they that sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
in them received no hurt. A Gentleman
of note there (one Mr. <HI>Hill)</HI> sitting in his
Seat by the Chancil, had his head suddenly
smitten against the Wall, by which blow he
died that night. Another had his Head clo|ven,
his Skull rent in three pieces, and his
Brains thrown upon the Ground whole. The
hair of his head through the violence
of the blow stuck fast to the Pillar
that was near him. A Woman attempting
to run out of the Church, had her clothes
set on fire; and her flesh on her back torn
almost to the very bone. See Mr. <HI>Clarks</HI>
Examples <HI>Vol. 1. Chap. 104. P,</HI> 501.</P>
<P>It is not Heresie to believe that <HI>Satan</HI> has
sometimes a great operation in causing Thun|der-storms.
I know this is vehemently de|nied
by some. The late Witch-Advocates
call it Blasphemy. And an old Council did
<HI>Anathematize</HI> the men that are thus perswa|ded:
but by their Favour; An orthodox &amp; rati|onal
Man may be of the Opinion, that when
the Devil has before him the Vapors and Ma|terials
out of which the Thunder and Light|ning
are generated, his Art is such as that he
can bring them into form. If Chymists can
make their <HI>aurumfulminans,</HI> what strange thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
may this <HI>Infernal Chymist</HI> effect? The Holy
<PB N="125" REF="78">
ptures intimate as much as this cometh to
In the sacred Story concerning <HI>Iob,</HI> we find
that Satan did raise a great Wind which blew
down the House where <HI>Iob</HI>'s Children were
Feasting. And it is said, <HI>Chap. 1. ver. 16. That
the fire of God fell from Heaven, and burnt up
the Sheep and the Servants; This <GAP DESC="foreign">
Fire of God</HI> was no doubt Thunder and Light|ning;
and such as was extraordinary, and is
therefore expressed with the Name of God,
as is usual amongst the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> Satan had
a deep policy in going that way to work,
thereby hoping to make <HI>Iob</HI> believe God was
his Enemy. Mr. <HI>Caryl</HI> (according to his
wonted manner) does both wittily and judi|ciously
paraphrase upon the place; <HI>The fire
of God</HI> (saith he) <HI>here is conceived to have
been some terrible flash of Lightning; and it is
the more probable because it is said to fall down
from Heaven,</HI> that is, <HI>cut of the Air. There Sa|tan
can do mighty things,</HI> command much of the
Magazine of Heaven, where that dreadful Ar|tillery
which makes men tremble, those fiery
Meteors, Thunder and Lightning are stored and
lodged. Satan let loose by God can do wonders in
the Air; He can raise Storms, He can discharge
the great Ordnance of Heaven, Thunder and
Lightning; and by his Art can make them more
terrible and dreadful than they are in their own
<PB N="126" REF="79">
nature. Satan is said to be <HI>the Prince of the
Power of the Air,</HI> Eph. 2. 2. And we read of
the working of Satan with all power and
signs, and lying words, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2. 9. It is
moreover predicted in the Revelation, that
Antichrist should <HI>cause fire to come down from
Heaven,</HI> Rev. 13. 13. Accordingly we read in
History, that some of the Popes have by
their skill in the black Art, caused Balls of
fire to be seen in the Air. So then it is not
beyond Satans power to effect such things, if
the great God give him leave, without whose
leave he cannot blow a Feather: much less
raise a Thunder-storm. And as the Scri|ptures
intimate Satan's Power in the Air to be
great, so Histories do abundantly confirm it
by remarkable Instances. One of the Scho|lars
of <HI>Empedocles</HI> has testified, that he saw
his Master raising Winds and laying them a|gain;
and there were once many Witnesses
of it, whence they called <HI>Empedocles
<GAP DESC="foreign"> Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> men|tions
this as unquestionably true. Our great
<HI>Rainold (de libris Apoeryphis</HI> Lect. 202.) saith,
that we may from <HI>Iob</HI> conclude, it was not
impossible for <HI>Empedocles</HI> by the Devils aid, to
do as has been reported of him. <HI>Dio</HI> relates
that when the <HI>Roman</HI> Army in the dayes of
the Emperour <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">udius,</HI> pursuing the <HI>Africa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="79">
was in extream danger of perishing by
Drought: a Magician undertook to procure
water for them, and presently upon his Incan|tations,
an astonishing shower fell. <HI>Iovianus
Pontanus</HI> reports, that when King <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
besieged the City <HI>Suella,</HI> all the waters in the
Cisterns being dried up, the Citizens had
like to have lost their lives by the prevailing
Drought. The Popish Priests undertook by
Conjuration to obtain Water. The Magical
Ceremonies by them observed were most hor|rid
and ridiculous. For they took an Asse,
and put the Sacrament of the <HI>Eucharist</HI> into
his Mouth, sang Funeral Verses over him,
and then buried him alive before the Church
doors; as soon as these rites, so pleasing to
the Devil were finished, the Heavens began
to look black, and the Sea to be agitated with
Winds, and anon it rained, and lightned, af|ter
a most horrendous manner. <HI>Smetius</HI> in
his <HI>Miscellanies,</HI> Lib. 5. Relates that a Girl
foolishly imitating the Ceremonies of her
Nurse, whom she had sometimes seen raising
Tempests, immediately a prodigious Storm of
Thunder and Lightning hapned, so as that a
Village near <HI>Lipsia</HI> was thereby set on fire&punc;
This Relation is mentioned by <HI>Sennertus,</HI> as
a thing really true. At some places in <HI>Den|mark,</HI>

to cause Winds, he may cause Storms also

between <HI>Lipsia</HI> and <HI>Torga,</HI> was suddenly car|ried
out of sight by a Thunder-storm, and
never seen more. And the truth of our as|sertion,
seems to be confirmed by one of
those sad effects of Lightning mentioned in
the precedeing Chapter. For I am informed
that when <HI>Matthew Cole</HI> was killed with the
Lightning at <HI>North-hampton,</HI> the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>

When the Law was given at Mount <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">

not only their Work, but all their
Tools and Instruments wherewith that cur|sed
Enterprize was to have been carried on,
so was their design utterly frustrate. Why
might not holy Angels have an hand in that
Lightning? There occurs to my mind, a
Remarkable Passage mentioned by Dr. <HI>Beard</HI>
in his Chapter about the Protection of Holy
Angels over them that fear God (P. 443.) he
saith, that a certain Man travelling between
two Woods in a great Tempest of Thunder
<PB N="130" REF="81">
and Lightning, rode under an Oak to shel|ter
himself, but his Horse would by no means
stay under that Oak, but whither his Master
would or no, went from that Tree and stayed
very quietly under another Tree not far off;
he had not been there many Minutes before
the first Oak was torn all to fitters with a
fearful Clap of Thunder and Lightning.
Surely there was the invisible Guardianship of
an Holy Angel in that Providence.</P>
<P>But though it be true, that both natural
Causes and Angels do many times concurre
when Thunder and Lightning, with the aw|ful
effects thereof, happen; nevertheless, the
supream cause must not be disackno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ledged.
The Eternal himself has a mighty hand of pro|vidence
in such works. He thundreth with the
voice of His Excellency. Among the <HI>Greeks</HI>
Thunder was stiled <GAP DESC="foreign"> And the Scri|pture
calls it <HI>the Voice of the Lord. The God of
Glory Thundereth. The Voice of the Lord is ve|ry
powerful, the Voice of the Lord is full of Ma|jesty,
the Voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars,
the Voice of the Lord divideth the Flames of

Mountains in <HI>Africa,</HI> on which the Cracks of
Thunder are so loud and vehement, as that
they are heard fifty Miles off at Sea. In
some parts of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> it will both Snow and
Thunder at the same time. In the Northern
Climates, there use to be vehement Thun|ders,
and Men are often struck dead thereby;
In the Province of <HI>Terravara</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> grows
the Wood for the Cross, to which Supersti|ous
Papists attribute a power to preserve Men

vainly think to secure themselves from Hea|vens
Gun-shot, by carrying those things a|bout
them, which they supposed would be as
<HI>Amulets</HI> to defend them from all harm. The
Tents of the old <HI>Emperors</HI> were made of <HI>Seal-Leather,</HI>
because they imagined that the Sea-Calf
could not be Thunder-struck. <HI>Tyberius</HI>
wore a Crown of Lawrel upon his Head,

so much afraid? to whom he replied; are
not you afraid to hear these dreadful Thunder

it is the voice of my Heavenly Father; and

</ARGUMENT>
<P>INasmuch as things which are praeternatu|ral,
and not accomplished without diabo|lical
operation, do more rarely happen, it is
pity but that they should be observed. Seve|ral
Accidents of that kind have hapned in
<HI>New-England;</HI> which I shall here faithfully
Relate so far as I have been able to come un|to
the knowledge of them.</P>
<P>Very Remarkable was that Providence
wherein <HI>Ann Cole</HI> of <HI>Hartford</HI> in <HI>New-En|gland</HI>
was concerned. She was, and is ac|counted
a person of real Piety and Integrity.
<PB N="136" REF="84">
Nevertheless, in the Year 1662. then living
in her Fathers House (who has like|wise
been esteemed a godly Man) She was
taken with very strange Fits, wherein her
Tongue was improved by a <HI>Daemon</HI> to ex|press
things which she her self knew nothing
of. Sometimes the Discourse would hold for
a considerable time. The general purpose of
which was, that such and such persons (who
were named in the Discourse which passed
from her) were consulting how they might
carry on mischievous designs against her and
several others, mentioning sundry wayes
they should take for that end, particularly that
they would afflict her Body, spoil her Name,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The general answer made amongst
the <HI>Daemons,</HI> was, <HI>She runs to the Rock.</HI> This
having been continued some hours, the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|mons</HI>
said, <HI>Let us confound her Language, that
she may tell n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> more tales.</HI> She uttered matters
unintel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">igible. And then the Discourse pas|sed
into a <HI>Dutch-tone</HI> (a <HI>Dutch</HI> Family then
lived in the Town) and therein an account
was given of some afflictions that had befallen
divers; amongst others, what had befallen a
Woman that lived next Neighbour to the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Family, whose Arms had been strange|ly
pinched in the night, declaring by whom&punc;
and for what cause that course had been ta|ken
<PB N="137" REF="84">
with her. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Stone</HI>
(then Teacher of the Church in <HI>Hartford)</HI>
being by, when the Discourse hapned, decla|red,
that he thought it impossible for one not
familiarly acquainted with the <HI>Dutch</HI> (which
<HI>Ann Cole</HI> had not in the least been) should so
exactly imitate the <HI>Dutch-tone</HI> in the pronun|ciation
of <HI>English.</HI> Several Worthy Persons,
<HI>(viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Iohn Whiting,</HI> Mr. <HI>Samuel Hooker,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Ioseph Hains)</HI> wrote the intelligible
sayings expressed by <HI>Ann Cole,</HI> whilest she
was thus amazingly handled. The event was
that one of the persons (whose Name was
<HI>Greensmith)</HI> being a lewd and ignorant Wo|man,
and then in Prison on suspicion for
Witch-craft) mentioned in the Discourse as
active in the mischiefs done and designed,
was by the Magistrate sent for; Mr. <HI>Whiting</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Haines</HI> read what they had written;
and the Woman being astonished thereat,
confessed those tings to be true, and that she
and other persons named in this preternatu|ral
Discourse, had had familiarity with the
Devil: Being asked whether she had made
an express Covenant with him; she answe|red,
she had not, only as she promised to go
with him when he called, which accordingly
she had sundry times done; and that the
Devil told her that at <HI>Christmass</HI> they would
<PB N="138" REF="85">
have a merry Meeting, and then the Cove|nant
between them should be subscribed. The
next day she was more particularly enquired
of concerning her Guil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">especting the Crime
she was accused with. She then acknow|ledged,
that though when Mr. <HI>Hains</HI> be|gan
to read what he had taken down in
Writing, her rage was such that she could
have torn him in pieces, and was as resolved
as might be to deny her guilt (as she had done
before) yet after he had read awhile, she was
(to use her own expression) as if her flesh
had been pulled from her bones, and so
could not deny any longer: She likewise de|clared,
that the Devil first appeared to her in
the form of a Deer or Fawn, skipping about
her, where with she was not much affrighted,
and that by degrees he became very familiar,
and at last would talk with her. Moreover,
she said that the Devil had frequently the car|nal
knowledge of her Body. And that the
Witches had Meetings at a place not far from
her House; and that some appeared in one
shape, and others in another; and one came
flying amongst them in the shape of a Crow.
Upon this Confession, with other concurrent
Evidence, the Woman was Executed; so
likewise was her Husband, though he did not
acknowledge himself guilty. Other persons
<PB N="139" REF="85">
accused in the Discourse made their escape.
Thus doth the Devil use to serve his Clients.
After the suspected Witches were either exe|cuted
or fled, <HI>Ann Cole</HI> was restored to health,
and has continued well for many years, ap|proving
her self a serious Christian.</P>
<P>There were some that had a mind to try
whither the Stories of Witches not being
able to sink under water, were true; and ac|cordingly
a Man and Woman mentioned in
<HI>An Cole's Dutch</HI>-toned discourse, had their
hands and feet tyed, and so were cast into
the water, and they both apparently swam
after the manner of a Buoy, part under, part
above the Water. A by-stander imagining
that any person bound in that posture would
be so born up, offered himself for trial, but
being in the like maner gently laid on the
the Water, he immediately sunk right down.
This was no legal Evidence against the su|spected
persons; nor were they proceeded a|gainst
on any such account; However doubt|ing
that an Halter would choak them, though
the Water would not; they very fairly took
their flight, not having been seen in that
part of the World since. Whether this ex|periment
were lawful, or rather Superstitious
and Magical, we shall (<GAP DESC="foreign">) enquire
afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="86">
Another thing which caused a noise in the
Countrey, and wherein Satan had undoubted|ly
a great influence, was, that which hapned
at <HI>Groton.</HI> There was a Maid in that Town
(one <HI>Elizabeth Knap)</HI> who in the Moneth
of <HI>October,</HI> Anno. 1671. was taken after a
very strange manner, sometimes weeping,
sometimes laughing, sometimes roaring hide|ously,
with violent motions and agitations of
her body, crying out <HI>Money, Money,</HI> &amp;c. In
<HI>November</HI> following, her Tongue for many
hours together was drawn like a semicircle up
to the roof of her Mouth, not to be remo|ved,
though some tried with their fingers to
do it. Six Men were scarce able to hold her
in some of her fits, but she would skip about
the House yelling and looking with a most
frightful Aspect. <HI>December</HI> 17. Her Tongue
was drawn out of her mouth to an extraordi|nary
length; and now a <HI>Daemon</HI> began ma|nifestly
to speak in her. Many words were
uttered wherein are the <HI>Labial Letters,</HI> with|out
any motion of her Lips, which was a
clear demonstration that the voice was not
her own. Sometimes Words were spoken
seeming to proceed out of her throat, when
her Mouth was shut. Sometimes with her
Mouth wide open, without the use of any of
the Organs of speech. The things then ut|tered
<PB N="141" REF="86">
by the Devil were chiefly Railings and
Revilings of Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> (who was at that
time a Worthy and Faithful Pastor to the
Church in <HI>Groton.)</HI> Also the <HI>Daemon</HI> bel|ched
forth most horrid and nefandous Blas|phemies,
exalting himself above the most High.
After this she was taken speechless for some
time. One thing more is worthy of <HI>Remark</HI>
concerning this miserable creature. She cri|ed
out in some of her Fits, that a Woman,
(one of her Neighbours) appeared to her,
and was the cause of her Affliction. The
Person thus accused was a very sincere, holy
Woman, who did hereupon with the Advice
of Friends visit the poor Wretch; and though
she was in one of her Fits, having her Eyes
shut, when the innocent person impeached
by her came in; yet could she (so powerful
were Satans Operations upon her) declare
who was there, and could tell the touch of
that Woman from any ones else. But the
gracious Party thus accused and abused by a
malicious Devil, Prayed earnestly with and
for the Possessed creature; after which she
confessed that Satan had deluded her; ma|king
her believe evil of her good Neighbour
without any cause. Nor did she after that
complain of any Apparition or Disturbance
from such an one. Yea, she said, that the
<PB REF="87">
Devil had himself in the likeness and shape
of divers tormented her, and then told her
it was not he but they that did it.</P>
<P>As there have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">veral Persons vexed
with evil Spirits, so divers Houses have been
wofully Haunted by them. In the Year
1679, the House of <HI>William Morse</HI> in <HI>New|berry</HI>
in <HI>New-England,</HI> was strangely disqui|eted
by a <HI>Daemon.</HI> After those troubles be|gan,
he did by the Advice of Friends write
down the particulars of those unusual Acci|dents.
And the Account which he giveth
thereof is as followeth;</P>
<P>On <HI>December</HI> 3. in the night time, he and
his Wife heard a noise upon the roof of
their House, as if Sticks and Stones had been
thrown against it with great violence; where|upon
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e rose out of his Bed, but could see
nothing. Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the Doors fast, he re|turned
to Bed again. About midnight they
heard an Hog making a great noise in the
House, so that the Man rose again, and found
a great Hog in the house, the door being shut,
but upon the opening of the door it ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">out.</P>
<P>On <HI>December</HI> 8. in the Morning, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
were five great Stones and Bricks by an <HI>invi|sible
hand</HI> thrown in at the west end of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB REF="87">
house while the Mans Wife was making the
Bed, the Bedstead was lifted up from the
floor, and the Bedstaff flung out of the Win+dow,
and a Cat was hurled at her; a long
Staff danced up and down in the Chimney;
a burnt Brick, and a piece of a weather|board
were thrown in at the Window: The
Man at his going to Bed put out his Lamp,
but in the Morning found that the Saveall of
it was taken away, and yet it was unaccounta|bly
brought into its former place. On the same
day, the long Staff but now spoken of, was
hang'd up by a line, and swung to and fro,
the Man's Wife laid it in the fire, but she
could not hold it there, inasmuch as it would
forcibly fly out; yet after much ado with
joynt strength they made it to burn. A shin|gle
flew from the Window, though no body
near it, many sticks came in at the same
place, only one of these was so scragged that
it could enter the hole but a little way, where|upon
the Man pusht it out, a great Rail like|wise
was thrust in at the Window, so as to
break the Glass.</P>
<P>At another time an Iron Crook that was
hanged on a Nail, violently flew up and down&punc;
also a Chair flew about, and at last lighted
on the Table where Victuals stood ready for
them to eat, and was likely to spoil all, only
<PB N="144" REF="88">
by a nimble catching they saved some of their
Meal with the loss of the rest, and the
overturning of their Table.</P>
<P>People were sometimes Barricado'd out of
doors, when as yet there was no body to do
it: and a Chest was removed from place to
place, no hand touching it. Their Keys being
tied together, one was taken from the rest, &amp;
the remaining two would fly about making a
loud noise by knocking against each other.
But the greatest part of this <HI>Devils</HI> feats were
his mischievous ones, wherein indeed he was
sometimes Antick enough too, and therein
the chief sufferers were, the Man and his
Wife, and his Grand-Son. The Man espe|cially
had his share in these <HI>Diabolical</HI> Mole|stations.
For one vvhile they could not eat
their Suppers quietly, but had the Ashes on the
Hearth before their eyes thrown into their
Victuals; yea, and upon their heads and
Clothes, insomuch that they were forced up
into their Chamber, and yet they had no rest
there; for one of the Man's Shoes being
left below, 'twas filled vvith Ashes and Coals,
and throvvn up after them. Their Light was
beaten out, and they being laid in their Bed
with their little Boy betvveen them, a great
stone (from the Floor-of the Loft) vveighing
above three pounds vvas throvvn upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="145" REF="88">
mans stomach, and he turning it down upon
the floor, it was once more thrown upon
him. A Box, and a Board were likewise
thrown upon them all. And a Bag of Hops
was taken out of their Chest, wherewith
they were beaten, till some of the Hops were
scattered on the floor, where the Bag was
then laid, and left.</P>
<P>In another Evening, when they sat by the
fire, the Ashes were so whirled at them, that
they could neither eat their Meat, nor endure
the House. A Peel struck the Man in the
face. An Apron hanging by the fire, was
flung upon it, and singed before they could
snatch it off. The Man being at Prayer
with his Family, a Beesom gave him a blow
on his head behind, and fell down before his
face.</P>
<P>On another day, when they were Win|nowing
of Barley, some hard dirt was
thrown in, hitting the Man on the Head,
and both the Man and his Wife on the back;
and when they had made themselves clean,
they essayed to fill their half Bushel but the
foul Corn was in spite of them often cast in
amongst the clean, and the Man being di|vers
times thus abused was forced to give o|ver
what he was about.</P>
<P>On <HI>Ianuary</HI> 23 (in particular) the Man
<PB N="146" REF="89">
had an iron Pin twice thrown at him, and his
Inkhorn was taken away from him while he
was writing, and when by all his seeking it
he could not find it, at last he saw it drop
out of the Air, down by the fire: a piece of
Leather was twice thrown at him; and a shoe
was laid upon his shoulder, which he catching
at, was suddenly rapt from him. An hand|ful
of Ashes was thrown at his face, and up|on
his clothes: and the shoe was then clapt
upon his head, and upon it he clapt his hand,
holding it so fast, that somewhat unseen pul|led
him with it backward on the floor.</P>
<P>On the next day at night, as they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
going to Bed, a lost Ladder was thrown a|gainst
the Door, and their Light put out;
and when the Man was a bed, he was beaten
with an heavy pair of Leather Breeches, and
pull'd by the Hair of his Head and Beard,
Pinched and Scratched, and his Bed-board
was taken away from him; yet more in the
next night, when the Man was likewise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
Bed; his Bed-board did rise out of its place,
notwithstanding his putting forth all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
strength to keep it in; one of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
brought out of the next room into his Bed&punc;
and did prick him; the clothes wherewith
he hoped to save his head from blows we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
violently pluckt from thence. Within a nig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">
<PB N="147" REF="89">
or two after, the Man and his Wife received
both of them a blow upon their heads, but it
was so dark that they could not see the stone
which gave it; the Man had his Cap pulled
off from his head while he sat by the fire.</P>
<P>The night following, they went to bed un|dressed,
because of their late disturbances,
and the Man, Wife, Boy, presently felt them|selves
pricked, and upon search found in the
Bed a Bodkin, a knitting Needle, and two
sticks picked at both ends. He received also
a great blow, as on his Thigh, so on his Face,
which fetched blood: and while he was wri|ting
a Candlestick was twice thrown at him,
and a great piece of Bark fiercely smote him,
and a pail of Water turned up without hands.
On the 28 of the mentioned Moneth, fro|zen
clods of Cow-dung were divers times
thrown at the man out of the house in which
they were; his Wife went to milk the Cow,
and received a blow on her head, and sitting
down at her Milking-work had Cow-dung
divers times thrown into her Pail, the Man
tried to save the Milk, by holding a Piggin
side-wayes under the Cowes belly, but the
Dung would in for all, and the Milk was only
made fit for Hogs. On that night ashes were
thrown into the porridge which they had
made ready for their Supper, so as that they
<PB N="148" REF="90">
could not eat it; Ashes were likewise often
thrown into the Man's Eyes, as he sat by the
fire. And an iron Hammer flying at him, gave
him a great blow on his back; the Man's Wife
going into the Cellar for Beer, a great iron
Peel flew and fell after her through the trap-door
of the Cellar; and going afterwards on
the same Errand to the same place, the door
shut down upon her, and the Table came and
lay upon the door, and the man was forced to
remove it e're his Wife could be released from
where she was; on the following day while he
was Writing, a dish went out of its place,
leapt into the pale, and cast Water upon the
Man, his Paper, his Table, and disappointed
his procedure in what he was about; his Cap
jumpt off from his head, and on again, and
the Pot-lid leapt off from the Pot into the
Kettle on the fire.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 2. While he and his Boy were eat|ing
of Cheese, the pieces which he cut were
wrested from them, but they were afterwards
found upon the Table under an Apron, and
a pair of Breeches: And also from the fire a|rose
little sticks and Ashes, which flying upon
the Man and his Boy, brought them into an
uncomfortable pickle; But as for the Boy
which the last passage spoke of, there re+mains
much to be said concerning him, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="149" REF="90">
a principal sufferer in these afflictions: For
on the 18. of <HI>December,</HI> he sitting by his
Grandfather, was hurried into great motions
and the Man thereupon took him, and made
him stand between his Legs, but the Chair
danced up and down, and had like to have
cast both Man and Boy into the fire: and
the Child was afterwards flung about in such
a manner, as that they feared that his Brains
would have been beaten out; and in the e|vening
he was tossed as afore, and the Man
tried the project of holding him, but ineffe|ctually.
The Lad was soon put to Bed, and
they presently heard an huge noise, and de|manded
what was the matter? and he an|swered
that his Bed-stead leaped up and
down: and they (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Man and his Wife)
went up, and at first found all quiet, but be|fore
they had been there long, they saw the
Board by his Bed trembling by him, and the
Bed-clothes flying off him, the latter they
laid on immediately, but they were no sooner
on than off; so they took him out of his
Bed for quietness.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 29. The Boy was violently
thrown to and fro, only they carried him to
the house of a Doctor in the Town, and
there he was free from disturbances, but re|turning
home at night, his former trouble be|gan
<PB N="150" REF="91">
and the Man taking him by the hand&punc;
they were both of them almost tript into the
fire. They put him to bed, and he was atten|ded
with the same iterated loss of his clothes.
shaking off his Bed-board, and Noises, that he
had in his last conflict; they took him
up, designing to sit by the fire, but the doors
clattered, and the Chair was thrown at him,
wherefore they carried him to the Doctors
house, and so for that night all was well. The
next morning he came home quiet, but as
they were doing somewhat, he cried out that
he was prickt on the back, they looked, and
found a three-tin'd Fork sticking strangely
there; which being carried to the Doctors
house, not only the Doctor himself said that
it was his, but also the Doctors Servant affirm|ed
it was seen at home after the Boy was gone.
The Boys vexations continuing, they left
him at the Doctors, where he remained well
till awhile after, and then he complained he
was pricked, they looked and found an iron
Spindle sticking below his back; he com|plained
he was pricked still, they looked, and
found Pins in a Paper sticking to his skin;
he once more complained of his Back, they
looked, and found there a long Iron, a bowl
of a Spoon, and a piece of a Pansheard.
They lay down by him on the Bed, with the
<PB N="151" REF="91">
Light burni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g, but he was twice thrown
from them, and the second time thrown quite
under the Bed; in the Morning the Bed was
tossed about with such a creaking noise, as
was heard to the Neighbours; in the after|noon
their knives were one after another
brought, and put into his back, but pulled out
by the Spectators; only one knife which was
missing seemed to the standers by to come
out of his Mouth: he was bidden to read
his Book, was taken and thrown about seve|ral
times, at last hitting the Boys Grandmo|ther
on the head. Another time he was
thrust out of his Chair and rolled up and
down with out cries, that all things were on
fire; yea, he was three times very dangerous|ly
thrown into the fire, and preserved by his
Friends with much ado. The Boy also made
for a long time together a noise like a Dog,
and like an Hen with her Chickens, and
could not speak rationally.</P>
<P>Particularly, on <HI>December</HI> 26. He barked
like a Dog, and clock't like an Hen, and af|ter
long distraining to speak, said, there's
<HI>Powel,</HI> I am pinched; his Tongue likewise
hung out of his mouth, so as that it could by
no means be forced in till his Fit was over,
and then he said 'twas forced out by <HI>Powel.</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="92">
He &amp; the house also after this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">d rest till the
ninth of <HI>Ianuary:</HI> at which time because of
his intolerable ravings, and because the Child
lying between the Man and his Wife, was
pulled out of Bed, and knockt so vehement|ly
against the Bed-stead Boards, in a manner
very perillous and amazing. In the Day
time he was carried away beyond all possibi|lity
of their finding him. His Grandmo|ther
at last saw him creeping on one side, and
drag'd him in, where he lay miserable lame,
but recovering his speech, he said, that he was
carried above the Doctors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">house, and that
<HI>Powel</HI> carried him, and that the said <HI>Powel</HI>
had him into the Barn, throwing him against
the Cart-wheel there, and then thrusting him
out at an hole; and accordingly they found
some of the Remainders of the Threshed
Barley which was on the Barn-floor hanging
to his Clothes.</P>
<P>At another time he fell into a Swoon,
they forced somewhat Refreshing into his
mouth, and it was turned out as fast as they
put it in; e're long he came to himself, and
expressed some willingness to eat, but the
Meat would forcibly fly out of his mouth;
and when he was able to speak, he said <HI>Powel</HI>
would not let him eat: Having found the
Boy to be best at a Neighbours house, the
<PB N="153" REF="92">
Man carried him to his Daughters, three
miles from his own. The Boy was growing
antick as he was on the Journey, but before
the end of it he made a grievous hollowing,
and when he lighted, he threw a great stone
at a Maid in the house, and fell on eating of
Ashes. Being at home afterwards, they had
rest awhile, but on the 19 of <HI>Ianuary</HI> in the
Morning he swooned, and coming to him|self,
he roared terribly, and did eat Ashes,
Sticks, Rug-yarn. The Morning following,
there was such a racket with the Boy, that the
Man and his Wife took him to Bed to
them. A Bed-staff was thereupon thrown at
them, and a Chamber pot with its Contents
was thrown upon them, and they were se|verely
pinched. The Man being about to
rise, his Clothes were divers times pulled from
them, himself thrust out of his Bed, and his
Pillow thrown after him. The Lad also
would have his clothes plucked off from him
in these Winter Nights, and was wofully
dogg'd with such fruits of Devilish spite, till
it pleased God to shorten the Chain of the
wicked <HI>Daemon.</HI></P>
<P>All this while the Devil did not use to ap|pear
in any visible shape, only they would
think they had hold of&punc; the Hand that some|times
scratched them; but it would give them
<PB N="154" REF="93">
the slip. And once the Man was discerna|bly
beaten by a Fist, and an Hand got hold
of his Wrist which he saw, but could not
catch; and the likeness of a <HI>Blackmore</HI>
Child did appear from under the Rugg and
Blanket, where the Man lay, and it would
rise up, fall down, nod &amp; slip under the clothes
when they endeavoured to clasp it, never
speaking any thing.</P>
<P>Neither were there many Words spoken
by Satan all this time, only once having put
out their Light, they heard a scraping on the
Boards, and then a Piping and Drumming
on them, which was followed with a Voice,
singing <HI>Revenge! Revenge! Sweet is Revenge!</HI>
And they being well terrified with it, called
upon God; the issue of which was, that sud|denly
with a mournful Note, there were six
times over uttered such expressions as <HI>Alas!
Alas! me knock no more! me knock no more!</HI>
and now all ceased.</P>
<P>The Man does moreover affirm, that a
Seaman (being a Mate of a Ship) coming
often to visit him, told him that they wron|ged
his Wife who suspected her to be guilty
of Witchraft; and that the Boy (his Grand|child)
was the cause of this trouble; and
that if he would let him have the Boy one
day, he would warrant him his house should
<PB N="155" REF="93">
be no more troubled as it had been; to which
motion he consented. The Mate came the
next day betimes, and the Boy was with him
until night; after which his house he saith
was not for some time molested with evil Spi|rits.</P>
<P>Thus far is the Relation concerning the
<HI>Daemon</HI> at <HI>William Morse</HI> his House in <HI>Newbery.</HI>
The true Reason of these strange disturban|ces
is as yet not certainly known: some (as
has been hinted) did suspect <HI>Morse</HI>'s Wife to
be guilty of Witchcraft.</P>
<P>One of the Neighbours took Apples which
were brought out of that house and put them
into the fire; upon which they say, their hou|ses
were much disturbed. Another of the
Neighbours, caused an Horse-shoe to be nail|ed
before the doors, &amp; as long as it remained
so, they could not perswade the suspected
person to go into the house; but when the
Horse-shoe was gone, she presently visited
them. I shall not here inlarge upon the va|nity
and superstition of those Experiments,
reserving that for another place: All that I
shall say at present is, that the <HI>Daemons</HI> whom
the blind Gentiles of old worshipped, told
their Servants, that such things as these
would very much affect them; yea, and that
certain Characters, Signs and Charms would
<PB N="156" REF="94">
render their power ineffectual; and accor|dingly
they would become subject, when their
own directions were obeyed. It is sport to
the Devils when they see silly Men thus de|luded
and made fools of by them. Others
were apt to think that a Seaman by some su|spected
to be a Conjurer, set the Devil on
work thus to disquiet <HI>Morse</HI>'s Family. Or it
may be some other thing as yet kept hid in the
secrets of providence might be the true origi|nal
of all this Trouble.</P>
<P>A Disturbance not much unlike to this
hapned above twenty years ago, at an house
in <HI>Tedworth,</HI> in the County of <HI>Wilts</HI> in <HI>En|gland,</HI>
which was by wise men judged to pro|ceed
from Conjuration.</P>
<Q><P>Mr. <HI>Mompesson</HI> of <HI>Tedworth</HI> being in
<HI>March</HI> 1661. at <HI>Lungershall,</HI> and hearing a
Drum beat there, he demanded of the Bai|liff
of the Town what it meant, who told
him, they had for some dayes been troubled
with an idle Drummer, pretending Autho|rity,
and a Pass under the hands of some
Gentlemen. Mr. <HI>Mompesson</HI> reading his
Pass, and knowing the hands of those Gen|tlemen,
whose Names were pretended to be
subscribed, discovered the Cheat, and com|manded
the Vagrant to put off his Drum,
and ordered a Constable to secure him: but
not long after he got clear of the Consta|ble.
<PB N="157" REF="94">
In <HI>April</HI> following, Mr. <HI>Momposson</HI>'s
house was much disturbed with Knockings,
and with Drummings; for an hour toge|ther
a <HI>Daemon</HI> would beat <HI>Round-heads and
Cuckolds,</HI> the <HI>Tattoo</HI> and several other points
of War as well as any Drummer. On <HI>No|vember</HI>
5. The <HI>Daemon</HI> made a great noise
in the House, and caused some Boards there|in
to move to and fro in the day time when
there was an whole room full of Peo|ple
present. At his departure, he left be|hind
him a Sulphurous smell, which was ve|ry
offensive. The next night, Chairs wal|ked
up and down the Room; the Childrens
Shoes were hurled over their heads. The
Minister of the Town being there, a Bed|staff
was thrown at him, and hit him on
the Leg, but without the least hurt. In the
latter end of <HI>December,</HI> 1662. They heard a
noise like the jingling of Money, the occa|sion
of which was thought to be, some
words spoken the night before, by one in the
Family; who said that <HI>Faires</HI> used to leave
money behind them, and they wished it
might be so now. In <HI>Ianuary</HI> Lights were
seen in the House, which seemed blue and
glimmering, and caused a great stiffness in
the eyes of them that saw them. One in
the room (by what Authority I cannot tell)
said, <HI>Satan,</HI> if the Drummer set thee a work
<PB N="158" REF="95">
give three knocks and no more, which was
done accordingly. Once when it was ve|ry
sharp severe Weather, the room was sud|denly
filled with a Noisome smell, and was
very hot though without fire. This <HI>Daemon</HI>
would play some nasty and many ludicrous
foolish tricks. It would empty Chamber|pots
into the Beds; and fill Porringers with
Ashes. Sometimes it would not suffer any
light to be in the room, but would carry
them away up the Chimney. Mr. <HI>Mompes|son</HI>
coming one morning into his Stable,
found his Horse on the ground, having one
of his hinder legs in his mouth, and so fa|stened
there, that it was difficult for several
men with a Leaver to get it out. A Smith
lodging in the House, heard a noise in the
room, as if one had been shoeing an Horse,
and somewhat come as it were with a Pin|cers
snipping at the Smith's Nose, most part
of the night. The Drummer was under ve|hement
suspicion for a Conjurer. He was
condemned to Transportation. All the
time of his restraint and absence, the House
was quiet. See Mr. <HI>Glanvil's</HI> Collection of
<HI>Modern Relations,</HI> P. 71. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P>But I proceed to give an account of some
other things lately hapning in <HI>New-England,</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="95">
which were undoubtedly praeternatural, and
not without Diabolical operation. The last
year did afford several Instances, not unlike
unto those which have been mentioned. For
then <HI>Nicholas Desborough</HI> of <HI>Hartford</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI>
was strangely molested by stones,
pieces of earth, cobs of Indian Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
falling upon and about him, which sometimes
came in through the door, sometimes through
the Window, sometimes down the Chimney,
at other times they seemed to fall from the
floor of the Chamber, which yet was very
close; sometimes he met with them in his
Shop, the Yard, the Barn, and in the Field at
work. In the House, such things hapned
frequently, not only in the night but in the
day time, if the Man himself was at home,
but never when his Wife was at home alone.
There was no great violence in the motion,
though several persons of the Family, and o|thers
also were struck with the things that were
thrown by an invisible hand, yet they were
not hurt thereby. Only the Man himself
had once his Arm somewhat pained by a blow
given him; and at another time, blood was
drawn from one of his Legs by a scratch gi|ven
it. This molestation began soon after a
Controversie arose between <HI>Desborough</HI> and
another person, about a Chest of Clothes
<PB N="160" REF="96">
which the other said that <HI>Desberough</HI> did un|righteously
retain: and so it continued for
some Moneths (though with several inter|missions.)
In the latter end of the last year,
when also the Man's Barn was burned with
the Corn in it; but by what means it came to
pass is not known. Not long after, some to
whom the matter was referred, ordered <HI>Des|berough</HI>
to restore the Clothes to the Person
who complained of wrong; since which
he hath not been troubled as before. Some
of the stones hurled were of considerable
bigness; one of them weighed four pounds,
but generally the stones were not great, but
very small ones. One time a piece of Clay
came down the Chimney, falling on the Ta|ble
which stood at some distance from the
Chimney. The People of the House threw
it on the Hearth, where it lay a considerable
time: they went to their Supper, and whilest
at their Supper, the piece of Clay was lifted
up by an invisible hand, and fell upon the
Table; taking it up, they found it hot, having
lain so long before the fire, as to cause it to
be hot.</P>
<P>Another Providence no less Remarkable
than this last mentioned, hapned at <HI>Portsmouth</HI>
in <HI>New-England,</HI> about the same time: con|cerning

which I have received the following
account from a Worthy hand.</P>
<Q><P>On <HI>Iune</HI> 11. 1682. Being the Lords Day,
at night showers of stones were thrown
both against the sides and roof of the house
of <HI>George Walton:</HI> some of the People went
abroad, found the Gate at some distance
from the house, wrung off the Hinges, and
stones came thick about them: sometimes
falling down by them, sometimes touching
them without any hurt done to them, though
they seemed to come with great force, yet
did no more but softly touch them; Stones
flying about the room the Doors being shut.
The Glass-Windows shattered to pieces by
stones that seemed to come not from with|out
but within; the Lead of the Glass
Casements, Window-Bars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being dri|ven
forcibly outwards, and so standing bent.
While the Secretary was walking in the
room a great Hammer came brusling along
against the Chamber floor that was over his
head, and fell down by him. A Candle|stick
beaten off the Table. They took up
nine of the stones and marked them, and
laid them on the Table, some of them being
as hot as if they came out of the fire; but
some of those mark't stones were found
flying about again. In this manner, abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

four hours space that night: The Secretary
then went to bed, but a stone came and
broke up his Chamber-door, being put to
(not lockt) a Brick was sent upon the like
Errand. The abovesaid Stone the Secreta|ry
lockt up in his Chamber, but it was fet|ched
out, and carried with great noise into
the next Chamber. The Spit was carried
up Chimney, and came down with the point
forward, and stuck in the Back-log, and be|ing
removed by one of the Company to
one side of the Chimney, was by an
unseen hand thrown out at Window. This
trade was driven on the next day, and so
from Day to Day, novv and then there
would be some intermission, and then to it
again. The stones vvere most frequent
vvhere the Master of the house vvas, vvhe|ther
in the Field or Barn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A black
Cat vvas seen once vvhile the Stones came,
and vvas shot at, but she vvas too nimble for
them. Some of the Family say, that they
once savv the appearance of an hand put
forth at the Hall Windovv, throvving stones
tovvards the Entry, though there vvas no
body in the Hall the vvhile: sometimes a
dismal hollovv vvhistling vvould be heard;
sometimes the noise of the trotting of an
horse, and snorting, but nothing seen. The
<PB N="163" REF="97">
Man went up the great Bay in his Boat to
a Farm he had there, and while haling
Wood or Timber to the Boat he was di|sturbed
by the Stones as before at home. He
carried a stirrup iron from the house down
to the Boat, and there left it; but while he
was going up to the house, the iron came
jingling after him through the Woods, and
returned to the house, and so again, and at
last went away, and was heard of no more.
Their Anchor leapt over-board several times
as they were going home and stopt the boat.
A Cheese hath been taken out of the Press
and crumbled all over the floor. A piece
of Iron with which they weighed up the
Cheese-press stuck into the Wall, and a
Kittle hung up thereon. Several Cocks of
English-hay mowed near the house, were ta|ken
and hung upon Trees; and some made
into small whisps, and put all up and down
the Kitchin, <HI>Cum multis aliis,</HI> &amp;c. After
this manner, have they been treated ever
since at times; it were endless to particu|larize.
Of late they thought the bitterness
of Death had been past, being quiet for
sundry dayes and nights: but last week we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
some Returnings again; and this week
<HI>(Aug.</HI> 2. 1682.) as bad or worse than ever.
The Man is sorely hurt with some of the
<PB N="164" REF="98">
Stones that came on him, and like to feel
the effects of them for many dayes. Thus
far is that Relation.</P></Q>
<P>I am moreover informed, that the <HI>Daemon</HI>
was quiet all the last Winter, but in the Spring
he began to play some ludicrous tricks, car|rying
away some Axes that were locked up
safe. This last Summer he has not made
such disturbances as formerly. But of this no
more at present.</P>
<P>There have been strange and true Reports
concerning a Woman now living near the
<HI>Salmon Falls</HI> in <HI>Barwick</HI> (formerly called
<HI>Kittery)</HI> unto whom Evil Spirits have some|times
visibly appeared; and she has some|times
been sorely tormented by invisible
hands: Concerning all which, an Intelli|gent
Person has sent me the following Nar|rative.</P>
<P>A Brief Narrative of sundry Apparitions of
Satan unto and Assaults at sundry times
and places upon the Person of <HI>Mary</HI> the
Wife of <HI>Antonio Hortado,</HI> dwelling near
the <HI>Salmon Falls:</HI> Taken from her own
mouth, <HI>Aug.</HI> 13. 1683.</P>
<Q><P>In <HI>Iune</HI> 1682. (the day forgotten) at
Evening, the said <HI>Mary</HI> heard a voice at the
<PB N="165" REF="98">
door of her Dwelling, saying, <HI>What do you
here?</HI> about an hour after, standing at the
Door of her House, she had a blow on her
Eye that settled her head near to the Door|post,
and two or three dayes after, a Stone,
as she judged about half a pound or a pound
weight was thrown along the house within
into the Chimney, and going to take it up
it was gone; all the Family was in the house,
and no hand appearing which might be in|strumental
in throwing the stone. About
two hours after, a Frying-pan then hang|ing
in the Chimney was heard to ring so
loud, that not only those in the house heard
it, but others also that lived on the other
side of the River near an hundred Rods
distant or more. Whereupon the said <HI>Ma|ry</HI>
and her Husband going in a <HI>Cannoo</HI> over
the River, they saw like the head of a man
new-shorn, and the tail of a white Cat a|bout
two or three foot distance from each o|ther,
swimming over before the <HI>Cannoo,</HI> but
no body appeared to joyn head and tail to|gether;
and they returning over the River
in less than an hours time, the said <HI>Appari|tion</HI>
followed their <HI>Cannoo</HI> back again, but
disappeared at Landing. A day or two
after, the said <HI>Mary</HI> was stricken on her
head (as she judged) with a stone, which
<PB N="166" REF="99">
caused a Swelling and much soreness on her
head, being then in the yard by her house,
and she presentl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> entring into her house
was bitten on both Arms black and blue, and
one of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">easts scratched; the impressi|ons
of the Teeth being like Mans Teeth,
were plainly seen by many: Whereupon
deserting their House to sojourn at a Neigh|bours
on the other side of the River, there
appeared to said <HI>Mary</HI> in the house of her
sojourning, a Woman clothed with a green
Safeguard, a short blue Cloak, and a white
Cap, making a profer to strike her with a
Fire-brand, but struck her not. The Day
following the same shape appeared again to
her, but now arrayed with a gray Gown,
white Apron, and white Head-clothes, in
appearance laughing several times, but no
voice heard. Since when said <HI>Mary</HI> has
been freed from those Satanical Molesta|tions.</P><P>But the said <HI>Antonio</HI> being returned in
<HI>March</HI> last with his Family, to dwell again
in his own house, and on his entrance there,
hearing the noise of a Man walking in his
Chamber, and seeing the boards buckle un|der
his feet as he walked, though no man
to be seen in the Chamber (for they went
on purpose to look) he returned with his
<PB N="167" REF="99">
Family to dwell on the other side of the Ri|ver;
yet planting his Ground though he
forsook his House, he hath had five Rods of
good Log-fence thrown down at once,
the feeting of Neat Cattle plainly to be
seen almost between every Row of Corn
in the Field yet no Cattle seen there, nor
any damage done to his Corn, not so much
as any of the Leaves of the Corn cropt.</P></Q>
<P>Thus far is that Narrative.</P>
<P>I am further informed, that some (who
should have been wiser) advised the poor
Woman to stick the House round with Bayes,
as an effectual preservative against the power
of Evil Spirits. This Counsel was followed.
And as long as the Bayes continued green, she
had quiet; but when they began to wither,
they were all by an unseen hand carried away,
and the Woman again tormented.</P>
<P>It is observable, that at the same time three
Houses in three several Towns should be mo|lested
by <HI>Daemons,</HI> as has now been related.</P>

<PB N="168" REF="100">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That there are <HI>Daemons.</HI> And Possessed Per|sons.
Signs of such. Some Mad Men are re|ally
Possessed. Notwithstanding many Fabulous
Stories about Witchcrafts. That there are Wit|ches
proved by three Arguments. That Houses
are sometimes troubled by Evil Spirits. Witch|craft
often the cause of it. Sometimes by the
Devil without Witchcraft; ordered by providence
as punishment for Sin. The disturbance in <HI>Wal|tons</HI>
House further considered, with a parallel
Story. That the things related in the preceding
Chapter were undoubtedly Praeternatural and
Diabolical.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Sadduces</HI> of those dayes being like
unto <HI>Avic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nna,</HI> and <HI>Averroes,</HI> and other
Atheistical Philosophers in former times; say
that there are no Spirits, and that all Stories
concerning them are either Fabulous or to be
ascribed unto natural causes. Amongst ma|ny
others, the Learned <HI>Voetius (in disp. de
operationibus Daemonum)</HI> has sufficiently refu|ted
them. And as the experience of other
ages and places of the World; so the things
which divine providence hath permitted and
ordered to come to pass amongst our selves
<PB N="169" REF="100">
(if the Scriptures were silent) make it ma|nifest
beyond all contradiction, that there are
Devils infesting this lower World. Most
true it is, that Satan and all his wicked An|gels
are limited by the providence of God:
so as that they cannot hurt any Man or Crea|ture,
much less any Servant of his, without a
Commission from him, whose Kingdom is o|ver
all. It is a memorable Passage, which
<HI>Chytraeus</HI> relateth concerning <HI>Luther,</HI> that
when he was sought after by his Popish and
Implacable Enemies (being then hid by the
Duke of <HI>Saxony)</HI> they consulted with Magi|cians
that so they might find where <HI>Luther</HI>
absconded, but the Wizzards confessed they
could not discover him. Undoubtedly the
Devils knew where <HI>Luther</HI> hid himself; only
God would not suffer them to reveal it. Ne|vertheless,
the Lord doth for wise and holy
ends, sometimes lengthen the Chain which
the infernal Lions are bound fast in. And as
there are many tremendous Instances con|firming
the Truth hereof, so that of Satan's
taking bodily possession of Men, is none of
the least. Sometimes indeed it is very hard
to discern between natural Diseases and Sa|tanical
Possessions; so as that persons really
possessed have been thought to be only mo|lested
with some natural Disease, without any
<PB N="170" REF="101">
special finger of the Evil Spirit therein. <HI>Fer|nelius
(de abditis rerum causis,</HI> Lib. 2. Cap. 16.)
speaketh of a certain young Gentleman, that
was taken with strange Convulsions, which
did surprize him at least ten times in a day.
In his Fits he had the use of his Speech and
Reason free. Otherwise his Disease would
have been judged no other than an ordinary
<HI>Epilepsy.</HI> Much means was used by skil|ful
Physitians for his relief, but without success
for three Moneths together; when all on a
sudden, a <HI>Daemon</HI> began to speak out of the
miserable Patient; and that with not only
Latin but Greek Sentences, which the affli|cted
party himself had no knowledge of;
and the <HI>Daemon</HI> discovered many secrets both
of the Physitians and of other persons that
attended, deriding them for their vain at|tempts
to cure a Man whom he had the pos|session
of. There are sundry Authors (in
special <HI>Balduinus</HI> in his Cases of Conscience,
and <HI>Darrel</HI> in his History of the seven posses|sed
persons in <HI>Lancashire)</HI> who have endea|voured
to describe and characterise possessed
persons. And such particulars as these fol|lowing
are by them mentioned as signs of
Possession.</P>
<P>1. If the party concerned shall reveal secret
things, either past or future, which without
<PB N="171" REF="101">
supernatural Assistance could not be known,
it argueth Possession.</P>
<P>2. If he does speak with strange Langua|ges,
or discover skill in Arts and Sciences ne|ver
learned by him.</P>
<P>3. If he can bear burthens, and do things
which are beyond humane strength.</P>
<P>4. Uttering words without making use of
the Organs of speech, when persons shall be
heard speaking, and yet neither their Lips nor
Tongues have any motion, tis a sign that an
evil spirit speaketh in them.</P>
<P>5. When the Body is become inflexible.</P>
<P>6. When the Belly is on a sudden puft up,
and instantly flat again.</P>
<P>These are thought to be certain Arguments
of an <HI>Energumenical</HI> person. Some other
signs are mentioned by <HI>Thyraeus (de obsessis</HI>
Part 2. Cap. 25, 26.)</P>
<P>There are who conceive (and that as they
suppose upon Scripture grounds:) that Men
may possibly be <HI>Daemoniacal,</HI> when none of
those mentioned particulars can be affirmed
of them. The Excellently learned and judi|cious
Mr. <HI>Mede,</HI> is of Opinion, that the <HI>Dae|moniacks</HI>
whom we read so frequently of in
the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> were the same with <HI>Epi|lepticks,
Lunaticks,</HI> and <HI>Mad Men.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI>
at this day have their <HI>Mad men</HI> in great vene|ration,
<PB N="172" REF="102">
supposing them to be acted by a spirit,
but they (in that being themselves mad) take
it to be a good when as 'tis an evil spirit that
does operate in such persons. And that the
<HI>Iews</HI> of old did look upon <HI>Maniacks</HI> to be
possessed with an evil Spirit, is evident from
that expression of theirs, <HI>Ioh. 10. 20. He hath
a Devil and is Mad.</HI> Moreover, we read of
one, <HI>Mat. 17. 15. that was Lunatick, and did
oft fall into the fire, and oft into the water.</HI> Now
that this <HI>Lunatick</HI> person was a <HI>Daemoniack</HI>
is clear from <HI>ver.</HI> 18. where tis said, that <HI>Ie|sus
rebuked the Devil and he departed out of him.</HI>
And of the same person tis said, in <HI>Luk. 9. 39
A Spirit taketh him and teareth him.</HI> So <HI>Beza</HI>
and <HI>Heinsius,</HI> in <HI>Mat.</HI> 8. 16. &amp; 17. 15. It has
been commonly said that in Christs time more
persons were possessed with evil Spirits than
ever was known before or since; but if that
were so, the <HI>Iews,</HI> and probably some <HI>Histori|ans</HI>
would have noted it as a thing strange
and extraordinary; whenas we read of no
such observation to be made on those times.
And saith Mr. <HI>Mede,</HI> (in his Discourse on
<HI>Iohn</HI> 10. 20.) <HI>If those possessed Persons were not
such as we now adayes conceive to be no other than
Mad men, the World must be supposed to be well
rid of Devils, which for my part I believe it is
not.</HI> There is in special, a sort of Melancholy
<PB N="173" REF="102">
madness, which is called <HI>Lycanthropia,</HI> or <HI>Lu|pina
Insania,</HI> h. e. When Men imagine them|selves
to be turned into Wolves or other
Beasts. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> relates concerning the
Daughters of King <HI>Praetus,</HI> that they thought
themselves Kine. <HI>Wierus (de praestigiis Dae|monum,</HI>
L. 3. C. 21.) speaketh of one in <HI>Pa|dua,</HI>
that would not believe to the contrary
but that he was a Wolf: and of a <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
who thought himself a Bear. <HI>Euwichius</HI> (and
from him <HI>Horestus)</HI> writeth of a Man that
was found in a Barn under the Hay, howling
and saying he was a Wolf. The foolish
Rusticks, who surprized him, began to flay
him, that so they might see if he had not
hair growing on the inside of his skin.. <HI>Fo|restus</HI>
has many instances to this purpose.
<HI>Heurnius</HI> saith, that it is a Disease frequent in
<HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hungaria.</HI> No doubt but this
Disease gave occasion to <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Assertion, that
some Men in his time were turned into
Wolves, and from Wolves into Men again.
Hence was <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Fable of <HI>Lycaon,</HI> and the
Tale of <HI>Pausanias,</HI> being ten years a Wolf,
and then a Man again. He that would see
more instances, may read <HI>Austin de civ. Dei.</HI>
L. 18. C. 5. <HI>Burton</HI> of Melancholly. <HI>Pag.</HI> 9.
They that are subject unto this Malady, for
the most partly hid all the day, and go abroad
<PB N="174" REF="103">
In the night, barking and howling at Graves
and in Desarts. We may suppose that <HI>Nebu|chadnezzar</HI>
was troubled with this Disease.
And that such persons are molested with a
<HI>Daemon</HI> is evident from <HI>Luk</HI> 8. 27. with <HI>Mark.</HI>
5. 3, 4. The possessed person there spoken of
was <HI>Lycanthropos.</HI></P>
<P>There are that acknowledge the existence
of Spirits, and that the Bodies of men are
sometimes really possessed thereby; who ne|vertheless
will not believe there are any such
woful creatures <HI>in rerum natur&acirc;,</HI> as Witches,
or persons confoederate with the Devil. I
have read of a famous Wizard, whose Name
was <HI>William de Lure,</HI> that after he had la|boured
much in opposing their Opinion,
who think that there are Men on Earth joyn|ed
in an explicit confoederacy with the fiends
of Hell, was himself convicted and condem|ned
for that crime which he designed to
make the World believe that no Man was
or could be guilty of. I shall not suspect all
those as guilty of Witchcraft, nor yet of He|resie,
who call the received Opinion about
Witches into question. There are four or
five <HI>English</HI> Writers, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Scot, Ady,</HI> and
of late <HI>Wagstaff</HI> and <HI>Webster,</HI> and another
Anonymous Author; who do with great
<PB N="175" REF="103">
vehemence affirm that never any did main|tain
that familiarity with the evil Spirits,
which is commonly believed. <HI>Wierus</HI> (other|wise
a judicious Author) conceiveth that all
those things supposed to be done by Witches
are done by the evil Spirits themselves, with|out
any confoederates. But he is sufficiently
refuted by <HI>Binsfieldius, Bodinus, Sennertus,</HI> and
others. True it is, that many things have
been looked upon as proceding from Witch|craft,
when it has not been so. The Sym|pathies
and Antipathies of Nature have some|times
been esteemed the effects of Witch|craft.
A Sympathetical Powder, made with|out
any Magical Ceremonies has done
strange things, so as that the Artist which
used it, has upon that account been suspected
of Witchcraft. A Man may easily by such
natural Magick, as is described by <HI>Porta,</HI> and
by <HI>Weckerus de secretis</HI> make the ignorant be|heve
he is a Wizard. It is also true, that the
World is full of Fabulous Stories concerning
some kind of Familiarities with the Devil,
and things done by his help, which are be|yond
the power of Creatures to accomplish.
What Fables are there concerning <HI>Incubi</HI> and
<HI>Succubae,</HI> and of Men begotten by <HI>Daemons?</HI>
No doubt but the Devil may delude the fancy
that one of his Vassals shall think (as the
<PB N="176" REF="104">
Witch at <HI>Hartford</HI> did) that he has carnal
and cursed Communion with them, beyond
what is real. Nor is it impossible for him to
assume a dead Body, or to form a lifeless one
out of the Elements, and therewith to make
his Witches become guilty of <HI>Sodomy. Austin</HI>
saith, they are impudent who deny this. But
to imagine that Spirits shall really generate
Bodies, is irrational. I am not ignorant, that
that there have been Men in the World (more
than one or two) pretended to be thus
begotten and born. Thus doth <HI>Niderius</HI> af|firm
concerning all the old Inhabitants of the
Isle of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> The like has been reported
concerning <HI>Arcturus,</HI> and concerning our
<HI>British Merlin.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Gentiles</HI> believed that
<HI>Homer, Aeneas, Hercules,</HI> and others were be|gotten
by <HI>Daemons;</HI> whom thereupon they
esteemed as <HI>Semidei.</HI> And <HI>Olympias</HI> the Mo|ther
of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, supposed her
self to be with Child by <HI>Iupiter Hammon.</HI>
When her Husband King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon</HI>
was absent from her, <HI>Nectanebus</HI> (an <HI>E|gyptian</HI>
Prince and a great <HI>Magician)</HI> sent
her word that <HI>Iupiter</HI> would embrace her, and
that he would come to her such a night in
the form of a Dragon; at the time appoin|ted
<HI>Nectanebus</HI> himself by his Magical impo|stures
made <HI>Olympias</HI> believe that a Dragon
<PB N="177" REF="104">
was in the room, and so did himself do that
which the deluded Queen thought <HI>Iupiter</HI>
had done. I doubt not but that <HI>Merlin</HI> and
others imagined to come into the World not
in the usual way, were the Sons of <HI>Daemons</HI>
just as <HI>Alexander</HI> was. It has been a received
maxim, that though the Devil may by his
Art produce Insects and Vermin (to the ge|neration
whereof a seminal vertue is not al|wayes
necessary) yet he cannot bring forth
a <HI>perfect animal.</HI> How then is it consistent
with reason, that he should produce a real
Man, who is of all <HI>Animals</HI> the most perfect,
and noble? It is also extreamly Fabulous,
that Witches can transform themselves or o|thers
into another sort of Creatures, <HI>e. g.</HI> in|to
Horses, Wolves, Cats, Mice, <HI>&amp;c. Carmini|bus
Circe socios mutavit Ulyssis.</HI> A blind Hea|thenish
phansie: And yet Stories of this
nature have been generally believed; and I
have not without wonderment seen grave
Authors relating them, as if the things had
been really so. But it is beyond the power
of all the Devils in Hell to cause such a trans|formation;
they can no more do it than they
can be the Authors of a true Miracle (see
<HI>Horstius</HI> Inst. Med. Disp. 3. Exercit. 9. Quest. 9.)
Though I deny not but that the Devil may
so impose upon the imagination of Witches
<PB N="178" REF="105">
as to make them believe that they are trans|muted
into Beasts. <HI>Sennertus</HI> (in <HI>Pract.
Med. L. 6. Part 9. Cap.</HI> 5.) reports that a No|ble
Person, and one worthy of credit, gave
him an account of a strange passage to this
purpose, which himself was particularly ac|quainted
with. The Story is this;</P>
<P>A certain Woman, being in Prison on suspi|cion
for Witchcraft; pretneding to be able
to turn her self into a Wolf, the Magistrate
before whom she was brought promised her,
that she should not be put to death, in case
she would then in his presence so transform
her self. Which she readily consented unto.
Accordingly she anointed her head, neck and
arm-pits; immediately upon which she fell
into a most profound sleep, for three hours;
after which she suddenly rose up, declaring
that she had been turned into a Wolf, and
been at a place some miles distant, and there
killed first a Sheep, and then a Cow; the
Magistrate presently sent to the place; and
found that first a sheep and then a Cow had
there been killed. <HI>Wierus</HI> and <HI>Baptista Porta</HI>
have divers Stories to the same purpose. It
is then evident, that the Devil himself did
that mischief, and in the mean time the Wit|ches
who were cast into so profound a sleep
by him, as that they could not by any noises
<PB N="179" REF="105">
or blows be awakened, had their Phansies
imposed upon by Dreams and Delusions ac|cording
to the pleasure of their Master Satan.
It must moreover, be sadly confessed, that
many innocent persons have been put to
death under the notion of Witch-craft, where|by
much innocent blood hath been shed.
Especially it hath been so in Popish times and
places. Superstitious and Magical wayes of
trying Wtiches have been a bloody cause
of those Murders. Sometimes Per|sons
have been tried for Witch-craft by
hot, sometimes by cold water (of which
more in the eighth Chapter of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s Essay)
sometimes by pricking them; sometimes by
sticking Awls under their Seats, sometimes
by their ability, or otherwise to repeat the
<HI>Lords Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Irish</HI> Witch which was tried at
<HI>Youghall, Sept.</HI> 11. 1661. being by the Court
put upon repeating the fifth Petition, alwayes
left out the words <HI>Forgive us our Trespasses.</HI>
Another Witch tried at <HI>Taunton</HI> 1663. could
not repeat the last Petition, but though she
was directed to say it after one that repeated
it distinctly, would say <HI>Lead us into Temptation,</HI>
and could never repeat it right, though she
tried to do it half a score times. But Judge
<PB N="180" REF="106">
<HI>Archer</HI> did wisely admonish the Jury, that
they were not in the least measure to guid
their Verdict by that, since it was no legal e|vidence.
The Author of the Advertisement
to Mr. <HI>Glanvil</HI>'s Relations (<HI>P.</HI> 171.) saith that
his curiosity led him to examine certain Wit|ches
at the Castle in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and that the
most notorious Witch of them all pleaded
that she was no Witch, because she was able
to say the <HI>Lords Prayer and the Creed,</HI> and
though she was out in repeating the <HI>Creed,</HI> and
said the <HI>Lords Prayer</HI> right. But from such
considerations as those which have been men|tioned,
<HI>Wierus</HI> and some others not Atheists
but persons of worth, have <GAP DESC="foreign">
run into an extream on the other hand, so as
to question whether there were any persons
really confoederate with the infernal spirits.
Nevertheless, that there have been such, the
following Arguments do manifest.</P>
<P>1. The Argument by many insisted on
from the Scriptures is irrefragable. Therein
Witch-crafts are forbidden. And we often
read in the Scripture of Metaphorical Be|witchings,
<HI>Nahum 3. 4. Gal.</HI> 3. 1. which Simi|litudes
are undoubtedly taken from things
that have a real existence <HI>in rerum natura.</HI>
Yea, the Scripture makes particular mention
of many that used those cursed Arts and Fa|miliarities
<PB N="181" REF="106">
with the Devil, <HI>e. g. Iannes,</HI> and
<HI>Iambres, Balaam, Manasseh, Simon, Elymas.</HI>
Nor is the Relation which the Scripture gi|veth
of <HI>the Witch of Endor,</HI> and the reasons
from thence deduced, to prove the being of
Witches, sufficiently confuted by any of our
late Witch-Advocate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. Though (as one speak|eth)
some men to elude the Argument from
that instance, <HI>play more Hocus-Pocus tricks in
the Explication of that passage than the Witch
her self did in the raising deceased Samuel.</HI> It
is a poor evasion in those who think to e|scape
the dint of this Argument, by pretend|ing
that the Witches and Familiar Spirits spo|ken
of in the Scripture, were only <HI>Iuglers,</HI>
or men that by <HI>Legerdemain</HI> would do strange
feats of activity. The Divine Law requires
that such Witches should be cut off by the
Sword of Justice; which may not be affirm|ed
of every one that shall without any con|foederacy
with the Devil play tricks of <HI>Le|gerdemain.</HI></P>
<P>2. Experience has too often made it ma|nifest
that there are such in the World as hold
a co respondence with Hell. There have bin
known Wizards; yea such as have taught o|thers
what Ceremonies they are to use in
maintaining communion with Devils. <HI>Tri|themius</HI>
his Book <HI>de septem Intelligentiis,</HI> and
<PB N="182" REF="107">
<HI>Cornelius Agrippa</HI>'s Books of occult Philoso|phy,
wherein too much of these nefandous
abominations is described, are frequently in
the hands of men. Several other Books there
are extant, which do professedly teach the
way of Familiarity with <HI>Daemons.</HI> The
Titles whereof, as also the Names of the Au|thors
that have published them, I designedly
forbear to mention, lest haply any one into
whose hands this Discourse may come, should
out of wicked curiosity seek after them to
the ruine of his soul. There are famous Hi|stories
of several, who had their <HI>Paredri</HI> or
Familiar Spirits, some in one likeness, some in
another, constantly attending them. Thus
had <HI>Apollonius Thyanaeus</HI> of old. And of
later times <HI>Mich. Scot,</HI> and <HI>Iosephus Niger.</HI>
Likewise <HI>Cardanus (de subtilitate,</HI> Lib. 19. <HI>P.</HI>
963.) writeth, that his own Father had such
a Familiar for thirty years together. So had
<HI>Christopher Waganeer</HI> a Familiar in the form of
an Ape for seven years attending him; so
had <HI>Folpardus,</HI> which two were at last carried
away Body and Soul by the Devil; unto
whose service they had devoted their lives.
There is also a true (as well as a Romantick)
Story of <HI>Faustus.</HI> The excellent <HI>Camera|rius</HI>
in his <HI>Horae subs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">civae</HI> Cent. 1. Cap. 70. re|lateth
strange things of him, which he recei|ved
<PB N="183" REF="107">
from those who knew <HI>Faustus,</HI> and were
Ey-witnesses of his Magical and Diabolical
Impostures: He also had a familiar Devil
in form of a Monk accompanying of him
for the space of twenty four years. <HI>Housdor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ius,</HI>
and <HI>Lonicer</HI> ad 2 Praec. P. 167. speak of
<HI>Faustus. Melancthon</HI> declares that he knew the
Man: so that <HI>Naudeus</HI> is to be convinced of va|nity,
in denying that ever there was such a
Person in the World. In a word, it is a thing
known, that there have been Men who
would discourse in Languages, and reason no|tably
about Sciences which they never learn|ed;
who have revealed Secrets, discovered
hidden Treasures, told whither stolen Goods
have been conveyed, and by whom; and that
have caused Bruit Creatures, nay Statues or
Images to speak, and give rational Answers.
The <HI>Iews Teraphims</HI> oftentimes did so: <HI>vide
R. Sol. Iarchi in</HI> Hos. 3. 4. <HI>Selden de diis syriis.
Part 1. Cap. 2. Thom. contra gentes Lib. 3. Cap.</HI>
104. Such things as these cannot be done
by the help of meer natural causes. It must
needs be then, that the practisers of them are
in confoederacy with Satan.</P>
<P>3. There have been many in the World,
who have upon conviction confessed them|selves
guilty of Familiarity with the Devil.
A multitude of Instances this way are men|tioned
<PB N="184" REF="108">
by <HI>Bodinus, Codron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hus, Delrio, Iac|querius,
Remigius,</HI> and others. Some in this
Countrey have affirmed, that they knew a
Man in another part of the World, above
fifty years ago, who having an ambitious de|sire
to be thought a wise man; whilest he was
tormented with the Itch of his wicked Ambi|tion,
the Devil came to him, with promises
that he should quickly be in great reputation
for his wisdom, in case he would make a cove|nant
with him; the conditions whereof were,
that when Men came to him for his counsel,
he should labour to perswade them that there
is no God, nor Devil, nor Heaven, nor Hell;
and that such a term of years being expired,
the Devil should have his Soul. The Articles
were consen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to. The Man continuing
after this to be of a very civil Conversation,
doing hurt to none, but good to many; and
by degrees began to have a Name to be a
person of extraordinary sagacity, and was
sought unto far and near for counsel, his
Words being esteemed Oracles by the vulgar.
And he did according to his Covenant upon
all occasions secretly disseminate Principles
of Athe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sm, not being suspected for a Wi|zard.
But a few weeks before the time in|dented
with the Devil was fulfilled; inex|pressible
horror of Conscience surprized him,
<PB N="185" REF="108">
so that he revealed the secret transactions
which had passed betwixt himself and the
Devil. He would sometimes, with hideous
roarings tell those that came to visit him, that
now he knew that there was a God and a
Devil, and an Heaven, and an Hell. So did
he die a miserable spectacle of the righteous
and fearful judgement of God. And every
Age does produce new Examples of those
that have by their own confession made the
like cursed Covenants with the Prince of
Darkness.</P>
<P>In the Year 1664, Several who were In|dicted
at the Assizes held at <HI>Taunton</HI> in <HI>So|mersetshire,</HI>
confessed that they had made an
Explicit League with the Devil, and that he
did Baptise Pictures of Wax with Oyl, gi|ving
them the Names of those persons they
did intend mischief unto.</P>
<P><HI>Anno.</HI> 1678. One <HI>Iohn Stuart,</HI> and his
Sister <HI>Annabil Stuart,</HI> at the Assizes held at
<HI>Paysley</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> confessed that they had
been in confoederacy with the Devil; and
that they had made an Image of Wax, cal|ling
it by the name of Sr. <HI>George Maxwel,</HI>
sticking Pins in the sides and on the breast of
it. Such an Image with pins in it, was re|ally
found in the Witches Houses; and upon
the removal of it, the pins being taken out,
<PB N="186" REF="109">
Sir <HI>George</HI> had immediate ease, and recovered
his health.</P>
<P>There is lately published (by Dr. <HI>Horneck</HI>)
the History of the Witches in <HI>Sweden,</HI> by
whose means that Kingdom was fearfully pla|gued:
upon Examination they confessed
their crime, &amp; were executed in the year 1670.</P>
<P>And no longer since than the last year, <HI>viz.</HI>
on <HI>Aug.</HI> 25. 1682. three women who were exe|cuted
at <HI>Exon</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> all of them con|fessed
that they had had converses and fami|liarities
with the Devil.</P>
<P>But the Instance of the Witch Executed
in <HI>Hartford,</HI> here in <HI>New-England</HI> (of which
the preceding Chapter giveth an account)
considering the circumstances of that Con|fession,
is as convictive a proof as most single
examples that I have met with. It is a vain
thing, for the Patrons of Witches to think
that they can <HI>Sham</HI> off this Argument, by
suggesting that these Confessions did pro|ceed
from the deluded imaginations of Mad
and Melancholly persons. Some of them
were as free from distemperature in their
Brains, as their Neighbours. That divers
Executed for Witches have acknowledged
things against themselves which were never
so, I neither doubt or deny. And that a de|luded
Phansie may cause persons verily to
<PB N="187" REF="109">
think they have seen and done these things
which never had any Existence, except in
their own Imaginations is indisputable. I
fully concur with a passage which I find, in
Worthy Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>'s late excellent Discourse
about the work of the Spirit in Prayer (<HI>Page</HI>
202.) where he has these words: <HI>We find
by experience that some have had their Imagina|tions
so fixed on things evil and noxious by sata|nical
Delusions, that they have confessed against
themselves things and crimes that have rendred
them obnoxious to Capital Punishment, whereof
they were never really and actually guilty.</HI>
This notwithstanding, that Persons whose
Judgement and Reason has been free from
disturbance by any Disease, should not only
voluntarily acknowledge their being in cur|sed
Familiarities with Satan, but mention the
particular circumstances of those Transacti|ons,
and give ocular demonstration of the
truth of what they say, by discovering the
<HI>Stigmata</HI> made upon their bodies, by the De|vils
hand: and that when more than one or
two have been examined apart, they should
agree in the circumstances of their Relations,
and yet that all this should be the meer effect
of Melancholly or Phrensie, cannot without
offering violence to Reason and common
Sense be imagined. And as there are Witches
<PB N="188" REF="110">
so many times they are the causes of those
strange disturbances which are in houses
haunted by Evil Spirits, such as those menti|oned
in the former Chapter. Instances con|cerning
this may be seen in Mr. <HI>Glanvils Col|lections,</HI>
together with the continuation there|of;
published the last year by the Learned
Dr. <HI>Henry More.</HI> Sometimes providence per|mits
the Devil himself (without the use of In|struments)
to molest the houses of some as
a punishment for sin committed. Most com|monly
either for the sin of Murder. <HI>Plutarch</HI>
writes that the House of <HI>Pusanias</HI> was haun|ted
by an evil spirit after he had Murdered
his Wife. Many like Instances, have been
reported and recorded by credible Authors.
Or else for the sin of Theft. As for <HI>Walton</HI>
the Quaker of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> whose House has
been so strangely troubled, he suspects that
one of his Neighbours has caused it by witch|craft,
she (being a Widow-woman) chargeth
him with injustice in detaining some Land
from her. It is none of my work to reflect
upon the Man, nor will I do it; only if there
be any late or old guilt upon his Conscience
it concerns him by Confession and Repen|tance
to give Glory to that God, who is able
in strange wayes to discover the sins of Men.
I shall here take occasion to commemorate
<PB N="189" REF="110">
an alike notable scene of Providence, which
was taken notice of in another part of the
World <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">il.</HI> at <HI>Brightling</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> in <HI>England:</HI>
The Minister in that Town (<HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Io|seph
Bennet</HI>) has given a faithful account of
that strange Providence, which is published
by Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in his Examples, <HI>Vol. 2. Page
593, &amp;c.</HI> I shall relate it in his Words, thus
he writeth concerning it:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1659. There was at <HI>Bright|ling</HI>
an amazing Providence, containing ma|ny
strange passages. A wonderful hand of
God, by what Instrument or Instruments
soever; which was, a fire strangely kindled,
which burnt down a Mans house, and after|wards
kindled in another, to which the mans
Goods were carried, and to which, himself,
and his Wife, and his Servant Girl were re|moved;
and several things were thrown by
an invisible hand, powerfully convincing,
and thereby discovering the Hypocrisie and
Theft of the Man, and for a warning to o|thers
to take heed of the like.</P><P><HI>November</HI> 7. In the Evening. The fire
first kindled in this Man's Milk-house, and
<HI>November</HI> 9. there was dust thrown upon
this Man and his Wife, as they lay in Bed
together, and there was knocking several
<PB N="190" REF="111">
times and the same morning divers things
were thrown about, and the Fire again
kindled in the Milk-house, which was yet
put out by the Woman her self; then it
kindled in the Eves of the house, in the
Thatch, which was put out by a Man which
was their next Neighbour. That night as
the Man had a pot of Beer in his hand, a
stone fell into the Pot: then did he set
down the pot upon the Table. When some
Men came to be with them that night, they
were speaking how convenient it would be
to have a Tub filled with Water, to stand
ready, in case they should have occasion to
use it, and as they were going out of the
door to prepare it, the fire again kindled in
the Milk-house, and suddenly the whole
house was on fire, but most of the Goods
and Household-stuff were carried out and
preserved: The fire was a strange fire, ve|ry
white, and not singing their hands when
they pulled the things out of it.</P><P>The next day the Houshold-stuff was
carried to another house, wherein was a
Family: but those were to be in one
end of the House, and the other, in the o|ther
end. But before the Man and his
Wife went to Bed, there was dust thrown
upon them, which so troubled them, that
<PB N="191" REF="111">
the Man having another Man with them,
and a Candle and Lanthorn in his hand,
came up to me (saith my Author) who
was in Bed, and asleep, but when I was a|wakened,
I heard him say, <HI>The hand of God
still pursues me,</HI> and so he intreated me to go
down with him, and accordingly I and my
Brother went down, where we found them
in the house, greatly troubled by reason of
things that were thrown about, and some
things were thrown presently after we came
in. Hereupon we went to Prayer, and as
I was kneeling down, dust was thrown up|on
me, but afterwards all was quiet, so long
as we were at Prayer. When we arose
from Prayer, I applied my self to the read|ing
of a portion of Scripture, which was
<HI>Psal.</HI> 91. The Man standing by me, and
holding the Candle, but presently some|thing
did beat out the Light; whereupon
the Man said, <HI>That some body else must hold it.</HI>
Presently a Knife was thrown at me, which
fell behind me; my Brother said, he saw it
come. Then a chopping Knife was thrown
(I think at the Man's Wife) whereupon
the Man said, <HI>Things are thrown at others for
my sake.</HI> At length he fell upon his knees,
and confessed that he had been an Hypo|crite,
and a Pilfering Fellow, and that he
<PB N="192" REF="112">
had robbed his Master, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he was
willing to separate the things which he had
taken wrongfully from the rest, which he
did accordingly; laying forth several things
which he said, were none of his, naming
the persons from whom he had taken them:
And as a great Chest was carrying forth,
Trenchers, Platters, and other things were
thrown about in so dreadful a manner, that
one not much noted for Religion, said,
<HI>pray you let us go to Prayer;</HI> and indeed that
was our only Refuge, so to go to God; and
so we spent our time as well as we could, in
Prayer, reading some portions of Scripture,
and singing of Psalms: And though di|vers
things
were thrown, as a Dish several
times, so that once I had a smart blow on
the Cheek with a Dish, and the Man that
lived in the House had his Boots thrown
at him, and a chopping Knife twice,
Crabs out of a Tub standing in the midst of
the room, a fire Brand though without fire,
and an hammer thrown twice, and a Bible.
The Man's Wife who lived in the house,
usually took up the things thus thrown; yet
still in time of Prayer, all was quiet. In the
morning after I had prayed (before which
Prayer I was hit with a Dish) my Brother
and I came away, and as we were coming
<PB N="193" REF="112">
near home, we turned aside to speak with a
Friend, but before we got home, we heard
that the house was on fire: hereupon they
sent for me again, and in the mean time,
they carried out their Goods, pulled off the
Thatch, and quenched the fire; yet <HI>(as I
heard)</HI> it kindled again, and again, till all
the Man's Goods were carried out: and
when these People whose House was burnt
down to the ground, together with all their
Goods, were removed into the Field, all was
quiet in this second house; But somethings
were thrown in the Field; and in the after|noon,
when another Minister and I went
to them, some assured us that some things
had been thrown. This was <HI>November</HI> 11.
the night following some noise was heard
among the Houshold-stuff, as was testified
to me.</P><P><HI>Thus these poor Creatures were distressed,
their House was burned down, that to
which they were removed several times fi|red,
so that neither they nor their Goods
might stay any longer there, nor durst any
other receive them: but they, with their
Goods were forced to lie in the open Field
for divers dayes and nights together; being
made a sad spectacle to all sorts of people
that came far and near, to see and hear of
<PB N="194" REF="113">
the Business. Hereupon I sent to some
neighbouring Ministers, to joyn with us in
keeping a Fast on</HI> November 15. <HI>and four
spent the time in Prayer and Preaching.
The Sermons were upon these Texts,</HI> Iob
11. 13. If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch
out thine hands towards him: if Iniquity be
in thine hand, put it far away, and let not
wickedness dwell in thy Tabernacles. For then
shalt thou lift up thy Face without spot; yea,
thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not be afraid,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Amos 3. 6. Shall a Trumpet be blown in
the City, and the People not be afraid? shall
there be evil in a City and the LORD hath not
done it? <HI>Luk.</HI> 13. 2, 3. &amp;c. Suppose ye that
these Galileans were sinners above all the Ga|lileans,
because they suffered such things? I tell
you nay: But except ye Repent, ye shall all like|wise
perish: or those eighteen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Isai. 33.
14, 15, 16. The Sinners in Sien are afraid,
fearfulness hath surprized the Hypocrites. Who
among us shall dwell with devouring fire?
Who among us shall dwell with everlasting
burnings? He that walketh righteously and
speaketh uprightly: he that despiseth the gain
of Oppression, that shaketh his hand from hold|ing
Bribes, that stoppeth his Ears from hearing
of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing of
evil: He shall dwell on high. His place of
<PB N="195" REF="113">
desire shall be the munitions of Rocks: Bread
shall be given him, his Water shall be sure.</P><P>The distressed persons attended diligently,
and a great Congregation was assembled.
These providential dispensations were not
ordinary; yet there was a seeming blur cast,
though not on the whole yet upon some
part of it; for their Servant Girl was at
last found throwing some things: and she
afterwards confessed that an old Woman
came to her, <HI>November</HI> 7. a little before these
things come to pass, and told her that her
Master and Dame were bewitched, and
that they should hear a great fluttering a|bout
their house for the space of two dayes;
she said also, that the old Woman told her,
that she must hurl things at her Master and
Dame, and withal bad her not to tell, for
if she did the Devil would have her: and
she confessed that she hurled the Fire-brand,
an Hammer, and an iron Tack; and said,
that she did it because the old Woman bad
her, and said to her, that if she hurled things
about the House it would be the better. But
besides the throwing of the things about,
there were other passages of providence ve|ry
observable an remarkable. One House
was at several times strangely fired, and not|withstanding
the warning they had, at last
<PB N="196" REF="114">
quite burned down: and another house to
whom they removed, greatly molested, and
at length fired. Besides the efficacy of
Prayer is most observable, for the encou|ragement
of the Duty, and God's Omnisci|ent
and Omnipotent providence wonder|fully
magnified, thus to discover the Hypo|crisie
and Theft of the Man, and yet with|all,
graciously and mercifully delivering
them. For though they were not wholly
delivered when the Fast was first appointed,
yet after the Fast they were fully freed, and
not at all any more troubled in that man|ner.
Thus far is Mr. <HI>Bennets</HI> Rela|tion.</P></Q>
<P>That the things which have been related
in the Chapter immediately praeceding, came
not to pass without the operation of <HI>Daemons</HI>
is so manifest, as that I shall not spend many
words concerning it. Though whether the
afflicted persons were only possessed, or be|witched,
or both, may be disputed. As for
the Maid at <HI>Groton,</HI> she was then thought to
be under bodily possession: Her uttering ma|ny
things (some of which were Diabolical
Railings) without using the Organs of
speech, and being able sometimes to act above
humane strength, argued an extraordinary &amp;
Satanical operation. Concerning the Woman
<PB N="197" REF="114">
in <HI>Berwick.</HI> Evil Spirits without being set on
work by Instruments, have sometimes caused
the like Molestation; but commonly such
things are occasioned by Witchcraft. Dr.
<HI>Balthasar Han</HI> (who was chief Physitian to
the Prince Elector of <HI>Saxony)</HI> relates con|cerning
one of his Patients: that in <HI>Novem|ber</HI>
1634. She was to the amazement of all
Spectators, pricked and miserably beaten by
an invisible hand; so as that her body from
head to foot was wounded, as if she had been
whipped with Thorns. Sometimes a perfect
sign of the Cross was imprinted on her skin;
Sometimes the usual configurations whereby
Astronomers denote the Caelestial Bodies,
such as <GAP DESC="foreign"> and their Conjunctions, and op|positions
by <GAP DESC="foreign"> and the Characters used by
Chymists <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (in which Sciences,
though that be not usual for those of her Sex,
she was versed) These Characters would re|main
for several Weeks after the invisible
hand had violently impressed them on her
body; also a Needle was thrust into her foot,
which caused it to bleed. Once she took the
Needle &amp; put it into the fire; &amp; then an Old
Woman to whom she had given some of her
wearing Linnen, appeared to her with a staff
in her hand, striking her with a cruel blow, &amp;
saying <HI>Give me my Needle.</HI> At last the mise|rable
<PB N="198" REF="115">
Patient by constant attendance to pray|er
and other Religious Exercises was delive|red
from her affliction. Many Instances of
an alike nature to this, are to be seen in the
Writings of those that Treat upon Subjects
of this kind. Sometimes (as <HI>Voetius</HI> and o|thers
observe) bodily possessions by evil Spi|rits
are an effect of Witch-craft. Examples
confirming this, are mentioned by <HI>Hierom,</HI>
in the life of <HI>Hilarion; Theodoret</HI> in his Histo|ry
of the Fathers, and by <HI>Anastasius.</HI> And
there are more Instances in <HI>Sprenger,</HI> and in
<HI>Tyraeus de Daemoniacis.</HI> It may be <HI>Ann
Cole</HI> of <HI>Hartford</HI> might be subject to both of
these miseries at the same time. Though she
be (and then was) esteemed a truly pious
Christian; such amazing Afflictions may be|fall
the Righteous as well as the Wicked in
this World. The holy Body of <HI>Iob,</HI> that so
his patience might be tried; was sorely hand|led
by Satan. We read in the Gospel of a
Daughter of <HI>Abraham,</HI> whom Satan had
bound for eighteen years, <HI>Luk. 13. 16. Mary
Magdalen,</HI> and several others who had been
molested and possessed by Evil Spirits, yet be|longed
to God, and are now in Heaven. So
might <HI>Ann Cole</HI> be a true Christian, and yet
be for a time under Satan's power as hath been
related. And that her Malady was not a
<PB N="199" REF="115">
meer natural Disease, is past all doubt, inas|much
as in those strange <HI>Paroxysmes</HI> where|with
she was at times surprized, the tone of
her Discourse would sometimes be after a
Language unknown to her. <HI>Lemnius</HI> indeed
supposeth that Melancholly Humors may
cause persons not only to divine, but to speak
with strange Tongues; And <HI>Forestus Lib. 10.
observat</HI> 19.) does not contradict his Opinion.
But the unreasonableness of that Phansie has
been sufficiently evinced by sundry Learned
Men. <HI>Vide Iohnston, Thaumatograph,</HI> Sect. 10.
<HI>Chap. 7. Art. 1. La Torr, Disp.</HI> 27. How shall
that be in the Mouth which never was in the
mind; and how should that be in the mind,
which never came there through the outward
senses? This cannot be without some super|natural
influence. As when things destitute
of Reason, have given rational Answers un|to
what hath been demanded of them; it
must needs have proceded from the opera|tion
of a supernatural Agent. It is reported
that one of the Popes in way of pleasancy,
saying to a Parrat, <HI>what art thou thinking of?</HI>
the Parrat immediately replied, <HI>I have consi|dered
the dayes of old, the years of antient times&punc;</HI>
at the which, Consternation fell upon the
Pope and others that heard the Words, con|cluding
that the Devil spake in the <HI>Parrat&punc;</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="116">
abusing Scripture Expressions; whereupon
they caused it to be killed. <HI>De La Cerda</HI>
speaketh of a Crow, that did discourse rati|onally;
undoubtedly, it was acted by a <HI>Caco-Daemon:</HI>
Some write of <HI>Achilles</HI> his Horse,
and that <HI>Simon Magus</HI> had a Dog that would
Discourse with him; yea, it is storied con|cerning
the River <HI>Causus,</HI> and the Keel of
Ship <HI>Argus;</HI> and of many Statues, that they
have been heard speaking. The Image of
<HI>Memnon</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> as the rising Sun shined
upon its Mouth began to speak. The Image
of <HI>Iuno Moneta,</HI> being asked if she would be
removed to <HI>Rome:</HI> Replied, <HI>that she would.</HI>
The Image of <HI>Fortune</HI> being set up, said <HI>rite
me consacrastis. Valer. Maxim. Lib.</HI> 1 Capult.
A <HI>Gymnosophist</HI> in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> caused an Elm with
a low and soft voice to salute <HI>Apollonius.</HI> Such
things must needs be the operation of <HI>Caco-Daemons.</HI>
The like is to be concluded, when
any shall utter themselves in Languages which
they were never learned. It is not they but
a Spirit which speaketh in them. The No|ble
Man whom <HI>Fernelius</HI> writeth of, was first
known to be possessed by a <HI>Daemon,</HI> inasmuch
as many Sentences uttered by him were
<HI>Greek,</HI> in which Language the Diseased per|son
had no knowledge. A Maid in <HI>Frank|ford</HI>
was concluded to be possessed, it that
<PB N="201" REF="116">
when in her Fits, she could speak the <HI>High
Dutch</HI> Language perfectly, though she never
learned it. <HI>Manlius</HI> writeth of a possessed
Woman, who used to speak <HI>Latin,</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI>
to the admiration of all that heard it.</P>
<P>I remember an Honourable Gentleman
told me, that when he was at <HI>Somers</HI> in <HI>France</HI>
a Woman there was possessed with a Devil;
many Learned Divines, both Protestants and
Papists discoursing with her; she would rea|dily
answer them, not only in the <HI>French</HI>
Tongue, but in <HI>Latin, Greek</HI> or <HI>Hebrew.</HI> But
when one Mr. <HI>Duncan,</HI> after he had Discour|sed
and received Answers in more learned
Languages, spake to her in the <HI>British</HI> tongue,
the <HI>Daemon</HI> made no Reply; which occasi|oned
great wonderment, and too much sport|ing
about a sad and serious matter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Concerning <HI>Apparitions.</HI> That they are not
so frequent in places where the Gospel prevaileth
as in dark corners of the Earth. That good An|gels
do sometimes visibly appear. Confirmed by
several Histories. That <HI>Caco-daemons</HI> often|times
pretend to be good Angels. That Satan
may appear in the likeness of Holy men; proved
by notable Instances. Concerning the appearance
of Persons Deceased. The procuring cause there|of
is usually some sin committed. Some late re|markable
Examples. Of Mens Covenanting to
appear after their Death. It is an heavy judge|ment
when places are infested with such doleful
<HI>Spectres.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS yet no place, nor any person in <HI>New-England</HI>
(excepting the Instances be|fore
mentioned) have been troubled with
<HI>Aparitions:</HI> Some indeed have given
out, that I know not what <HI>Spectres</HI> were seen
by them; but upon enquiry, I cannot find
that there was any thing therein, more than
Phansie, and frightful Apprehensions with|out
sufficient ground. Nevertheless, that
Spirits have sometimes really (as well as ima|ginarily)
appeared to Mortals in the World,
<PB N="203" REF="117">
is amongst sober Men beyond controversie.
And that such things were of old taken no|tice
of, we may rationally conclude from
that Scripture, <HI>Luk.</HI> 24. 37. where it is said,
that the Disciples <HI>were terrified and affrighted,
and supposed that they had seen a Spirit.</HI> It is
observable, that such frightful <HI>Spectres</HI> do most
frequently shew themselves in places where
the light of the Gospel hath not prevailed.
Some have propounded it as a question wor|thy
the inquiring into; What should be the
reason that <HI>Daemons</HI> did ordinarily infest the
Gentiles of old, as also the East and West <HI>In|dians</HI>
of later times, and that Popish Coun|tries
are still commonly and grievously mo|lested
by them; but in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and in the <HI>united Provinces,</HI> and in all Lands
where the Reformed Religion hath taken
place, such things are more rare. <HI>Popish Au|thors</HI>
do acknowledge that as to matter of
fact it is really thus; and the reason which
some of them assign for it, is, that the Devils
are so sure of their Interest in <HI>Heretical Na|tions,</HI>
as that they pass over them, and come
&amp; molest <HI>Papists,</HI> whom they are most afraid
of losing. But they should rather have at|tributed
it to the Light of the Gospel, and the
power of Christ going along therewith.
<HI>Iustin Martyr, Tertullian,</HI> and others observe
<PB N="204" REF="118">
that upon the first promulgation of the Go|spel,
those Diabolical Oracles, whereby Satan
had miserably deceived the Nations, were si|lenced;
in which respect the Word of Christ
<HI>Luk.</HI> 10. 17. was wonderfully fulfilled. The
like may be said as to <HI>Protestant</HI> being less im|posed
upon then <HI>Popish</HI> Nations, by deceitful
<HI>Daemons.</HI> It is moreover, sometimes very
difficult to pass a true judgement of the
<HI>Spectres</HI> which do appear, whether they are
good or evil Angels, or the Spirits of decea|sed
men. That Holy Angels were frequent|ly
seen in old times, we are from the Scri|ptures
of truth assured. And that the Ange|lical
ministration doth still continue is past
doubt, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 14. But their visible appearance
is less frequent than formerly. They do in|visibly
perform many a good Office for the
Heirs of Salvation continually. Nor is it to
be questioned, but they may still appear visi|bly,
when the work which they are sent about
cannot otherwise be performed. I would
not reject as fabulous all those passages which
are related by Judicious Authors referring to
this subject.</P>
<P>At a time when <HI>Grynaeus, Melancthon,</HI> and
several other learned Men were discoursing
together at an House in <HI>Spyres,</HI> there came a
Man of very grave and godly countenance
<PB N="205" REF="118">
into the House, desiring to speak with <HI>Me|lancthon;</HI>
who going forth to him, he told
him that within one hour some Officers
would be at that house to apprehend <HI>Grynaeus,</HI>
and therefore required <HI>Melancthon</HI> to advise
<HI>Grynaeus</HI> to flee out of that City; and having
so spoken, he vanished out of sight. <HI>Me|lancthon</HI>
returning into the room, recounted
the words of this strange Monitor; where|upon
<HI>Grynaeus</HI> instantly departed; and he had
no sooner Boated himself upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> but
Officers came to lay hold of him. This Sto|ry
is mentioned by <HI>Melancthon</HI> in his Com|mentary
upon <HI>Dani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</HI> And he concludeth
that the Man who had appeared to him was
indeed an Angel, sent in order to <HI>Grynaeus</HI> his
being delivered from the bloody hands of
them that sought his life. Many Instances like
to this I could mention. But I shall only take
notice of a strange providence which came to
pass of late years; the particulars whereof
are known to some who I suppose may be
still living.</P>
<P>I find the History of the matter I intend
in Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s Examples, <HI>Vol. 2. Page</HI> 18, 19.
It is in brief as followeth;</P>
<P>One <HI>Samuel Wallas</HI> of <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lincoln|shire,</HI>
having been in a Consumption for thir|teen
years, was worn away to a very skeleton
<PB N="206" REF="119">
and lay bed-rid for four years. But <HI>April</HI> 7.
1659. being the Lords Day, about 6 <HI>h. P. M.</HI>
Finding himself somewhat revived, he got
out of the Bed, and as he was reading a Book
Entituled, <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <HI>suit for Sodom,</HI> he heard
some body knock at the Door. Whereupon
(there being none then in the house but him|self)
he took a staff in the one hand, and
leaning to the wall with the other, came to
the door, and opening it, a comely and grave
old Man of a fresh complexion, with white
curled Hair, entred; and after walking seve|ral
times about the room, said to him, <HI>Friend,
I perceive you are not well.</HI> To whom <HI>Wallas</HI>
replied, he had been ill many years, and that
the Doctors said his Disease was a Consum|ption,
and past cure, and that he was a poor
Man, and not able to follow their costly pre|scriptions,
only he committed himself and
life into the hands of God, to dispose of as he
pleased. To whom the Man replied, <HI>Thou
sayest very well, be sure to fear God, and serve
him; and remember to observe what now I say
to thee;</HI> Tomorrow morning go into the Gar|den,
and there take two leaves of red Sage&punc;
and one of Blood-wort; and put those three
Leaves into a cup of small Beer, and drink
thereof as oft as need requires; the fourth
Morning cast away those Leaves, and put in
<PB N="207" REF="119">
fresh ones, thus do for twelve dayes together;
and thou shalt find e're these twelve dayes be
expired, through the help of God thy Disease
will be cured, and the frame of thy body al|tered.
Also he told him that after his strength
was somewhat recovered, he should change
the Air, and go three or four Miles off; and
that within a Moneth he should find that the
Clothes which he had on his Back would
then be too strait for him: Having spoken
these things, he again charged <HI>Samuel Wallas</HI>
to remember the Directions given to him, but
above all things to fear God, and serve him.
<HI>Wallas</HI> asked him, if he would eat anything?
unto whom he answered, <HI>No Friend,</HI> the Lord
Christ is sufficient for me. Seldom do I
drink any thing but what cometh from the
Rock. So wishing the Lord of Heaven to
be with him, he departed. <HI>Samuel Wallas</HI>
saw him go out of the door, and went to shut
the door after him, at which he returned half
way into the Entry again, saying Friend, <HI>Re|member
what I have said to you, and do it, but
above all fear God, and serve him. Wallas</HI> be|held
the Man passing in the Street, but none
else observed him, though some were then
standing in the doors opposite to <HI>Wallas</HI> his
House. And although it Rained when this
Grave Person came into the House, and had
<PB N="208" REF="120">
done so all that day, yet he had not one spot
of wet or dirt upon him. <HI>Wallas</HI> followed
the Directions prescribed, and was restored to
his Health within the dayes mentioned. The
Fame of this strange Providence being noi|sed
abroad, sundry Ministers met at <HI>Stam|ford,</HI>
to consider and consult about it, who
concluded that this cure was wrought by a
good Angel, sent from Heaven upon that Er|rand.
However it is not impossible, but that
Holy Angels may appear, and visibly converse
with some. Yet for any to desire such a thing
is unwarrantable, and exceeding dangerous.
For thereby some have been imposed upon
by wicked <HI>Daemens,</HI> who know how to trans|form
themselves into Angels of Light.</P>
<P><HI>Bodinus</HI> hath a strange Relation of a Man
that prayed much for the assistance of an An|gel;
and after that for above thirty years to|gether,
he thought his prayer was heard; be|ing
often admonished of his Errors by a Cae|lestial
Monitor, as he apprehended, who once
appeared visibly in the form of a Child; o|therwhile
in an orb of Light. Would some|times
speak to him when he saw nothing.
Yet some fear that this Spirit which he took
to be his good <HI>Genius</HI> was a subtle <HI>Cacodaemon.
Plato</HI> writeth concerning <HI>Socrates,</HI> that he
had a good <HI>Genius</HI> attending him, which
<PB N="209" REF="120">
would still admonish him if he were about
to do any thing that would prove ill or un|happy.</P>
<P>The Story of the Familiarity which was
between Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Kellet,</HI> with the Spirits
which used to appear to them, is famously
known. Those <HI>Daemons</HI> would pretend to
discover rare Mysteries to them, and at times
would give them good Advices in many things,
so that they verily thought they had had ex|traordinary
communion with Holy Angels,
when as it is certain they were deceived by
subtile and unclean Devils, since the Spirits
they conversed with, did at last advise them
to break the seventh Commandment of the
Moral Law. Satan to insinuate himself and
carry on a wicked design, will sometimes
seem to perswade Men unto great Acts of
Piety.</P>
<P><HI>Remigius</HI> (and from him others) write
of a young Man whose Name was <HI>Theodore
Maillot,</HI> unto whom a <HI>Daemon</HI> appearing, ad|vised
him to reform his life, to abstain from
Drunkenness, Thefts, Uncleanness, and the
like evils; and to Fast twice a Week, to be
constant in attendance upon publick Wor|ship,
and to be very charitable to the Poor.</P>
<P>The like pious Advice did another <HI>Daemon</HI>
follow a certain Woman with, unto whom he
<PB N="210" REF="121">
appeared. Could a good Angel have given
better Counsel? but this was Satans policy,
hoping that thereby he should have gained an
advantage to take silly Souls alive in his cruel
Snare. Like as Thieves upon the Road will
sometimes enter into Religious Discourse,
that so their fellow-Travellers may have good
thoughts of them, and be the more easily
dispoyled by them. And as the evil Spirit
will speak good Words, so doth he sometimes
appear in the likeness of good Men, to the
end that he may the more effectually deceive
and delude all such as shall be so unhappy as
to entertain converses with him. No doubt
but that he knows how to transform himself
into the shape of not only an ordinary Saint,
but of an Apostle, or holy Prophet of God,
2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 13, 14. This we may gather from
the sacred History of dead <HI>Samuel</HI>'s appear|ing
to <HI>Saul.</HI> Some are of Opinion that real
<HI>Samuel</HI> spake to <HI>Saul,</HI> his Soul being by Ma|gical
incantations returned into his Body, so
divers of the Fathers and School-men; also
<HI>Mendoza, Delrio,</HI> and other Popish Authors.
Of late M. <HI>Glanvil</HI> and Dr. <HI>Windet,</HI> do in
part favour that notion. But <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and
the Author of the <HI>Quest.</HI> and <HI>Respons.</HI> which
pass under the Name of <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> are
of the judgement, that a lying <HI>Daemon</HI> ap|peared
<PB N="211" REF="121">
to <HI>Saul</HI> in <HI>Samuel</HI>'s likeness. Our Pro|testant
Divines generally are of this judgment.
It was customary amongst the Gentiles for
Magicians and <HI>Necromancers</HI> to cause dead
persons to appear, and they would bring
whomsoever they were desired to call for.
Thus did a Wizard by <HI>Pompeys</HI> command, call
a dead Souldier, of whom he enquired of the
event of the <HI>Pharsalic War,</HI> vide <HI>Lucan Lib.</HI> 6.
Many Examples to this purpose, are Recor|ded
in the Histories of former times; and
mentioned by the old Poets. Those <HI>Appari|tions</HI>
were <HI>Cacodaemons,</HI> which feigned them|selves
to be the Spirits of Men departed. I
see no cogent reason why we should not con|clude
the like with respect unto <HI>Samuel</HI>'s ap|pearing
unto <HI>Saul.</HI> Most certain it is, that
the Souls of holy Men departed, are not un|der
the power of Devils, much less of Ma|gicians
to bring them hither when they please.
As for those that are gone into the other
World, there is a Gulf fixed, that if men
would they cannot pass into this World again
without leave, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16. 26. If <HI>Dives</HI> could not
bring <HI>Lazarus</HI> his Soul out of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bo|some,
how the Witch of <HI>Endor</HI> should be a|ble
to bring <HI>Samuel</HI>'s Soul from thence I know
not. <HI>Lyra</HI> (and from him others) pretends
that God then interposed and sent real <HI>Samuel</HI>
<PB N="212" REF="122">
as he unexpectedly appeared to <HI>Baalam,</HI> when
imployed about his Magical impostures. But I
dare not believe that the Holy God, or the
true <HI>Samuel</HI> would seem so far to countenance
<HI>Necromancie</HI> or <HI>Psycomancy</HI> as this would be,
should the Soul of <HI>Samuel</HI> really return into
the World, when a Witch called for him,
<HI>Saul</HI> desiring that it might be so. This Opi|nion
establisheth <HI>Necromancy,</HI> the main Prin|cipal
upon which that cursed and lying Art is
built, being this, that it is possible for men to
cause the Souls of dead persons to be brought
back again. This seeming <HI>Samuel</HI> did not at
all ascribe his appearance to the extraordinary
providence of God, but rather to the Devil,
since he complained that <HI>Saul</HI> had by the
Witch disquieted him. The appearing <HI>Sam|uel</HI>
was seen <HI>ascending</HI> out of the Earth, when|as
the true <HI>Samuel</HI> would rather have appear|ed
as <HI>descending</HI> from Heaven. Moreover the
words of the Witches, <HI>Samuel,</HI> when he said,
<HI>tomorrow thou and thy Sons shall be with me,
1 Sam.</HI> 29. 18. are hardly consistent with truth.
Nor is it likely, that the true <HI>Samuel</HI> would
Preach nothing but Desperation to <HI>Saul,</HI>
without so much as once exhorting him in a
way of Repentance, to endeavour that his
peace might be made with that God whom he
had provoked by his sins, <HI>V. P. Martyr.</HI> in 1
<PB N="213" REF="122">
<HI>Sam. 28. P.</HI> 161, 162. and <HI>Voet. de spectris Page</HI>
1006. This Instance then, doth suffic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ently
prove that Satan may appear in the shape of
an holy Man. Some acknowledge that he
may do so as to persons that are dead, but that
he cannot personate good and innocent Men
who are still living. It is by some reported,
that Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> did once deliver such a notion.
Nothing is more frequent, then for the judg|ment
of worthy Men to be misrepresented
after they are gone, and not capable of clear|ing
themselves. I know Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was a
Man of great reading, and of deep Judg|ment.
I shall therefore rather suppose that
they who relate Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s Opinion, did
themselves mistake him, then believe that a
Man so learned and wise, would express him|self,
as some say he did. Sure I am, that Au|thentick
Historians mention Examples to the
contrary.</P>
<P>Memorable is that which <HI>Lavater (de spe|ctris</HI>
Part. 1 Cap. 19. <HI>P. mihi</HI> 86.) hath testi|fied,
<HI>sc.</HI> That the <HI>Praefect</HI> of <HI>Zurick</HI> travelling
abroad with his Servant betimes in the Morn|ing,
they saw an honest Citizen committing
nefandous villany, at the which being a|stonished,
they returned back, and knocking
at the Citizens door, they found him in his
own House, nor had he been abroad that
<PB N="214" REF="123">
Morning, so that what the <HI>Praefect</HI> and his
Servant beheld, appeared to be nothing else
but a Diabolical illusion; a spiteful <HI>Daemon</HI>
designing to blast the credit, and take away
the life of an innocent man. It is also
reported by <HI>Albertus Granzius (Lib. 4.
Cap.</HI> 5.) that <HI>Kunegund</HI> the <HI>Empress,</HI> was
for some time thought to be guilty of A|dultery,
by reason that a Noble person was
frequently seen going out of her Chamber;
but it after appeared that the suspected Noble
person had not been there, only a <HI>Daemon</HI> in his
shape. I concern not my self, with the Au|thentickness
of that Relation. The matter
in hand is sufficiently confirmed by a thing
that hapned more lately, and nearer home:
For if any of the old Puritans, who lived in
<HI>Colchester</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> fifty years ago, be yet
surviving, they can doubtless remember the
strange things which hapned to one Mr.
<HI>Earl,</HI> a young man in those dayes. The De|vil
did then frequently appear to him in the
shape of some of his acquaintance, and
would perswade him to three things. 1. That
he should abstain from Praying. 2. That he
should not frequent Church-Meetings.
3. That he should never Marry. But he did
not hearken to these suggestions. The night
wherein he was Married, soon after he and
<PB N="215" REF="123">
his Wife were Bedded, the Devil came into
the room, and pulled two of his Teeth out of
his head, which put him to great pain; where|upon
he cried out, and when his Friends
came in, they found his Mouth bloody, and
used means to ease his pain. This Mr. <HI>Earl</HI>
was afterwards for the space of ten years e|ver
and anon assaulted by the Devil, who un|der
many appearances of his Friends, did en|deavour
to seduce him. There were then
two famous Men Ministers of those parts,
<HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> of <HI>Dedham,</HI> (who was
Father to the late eminent Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Ro|gers</HI>
of <HI>Ipswich</HI> in <HI>New-England)</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Liddal</HI> of <HI>Colchester.</HI> With these Mr. <HI>Earl</HI>
did converse for comfort and instruction; but
chiefly with Mr. <HI>Liddal,</HI> then whom there was
not a man more eminent for Godliness. It fell
out once that the Devil came to Mr. <HI>Earl</HI> in
Mr. <HI>Liddal</HI>'s shape, and as Mr. <HI>Earl</HI>'s custom
was, he did propose to the seeming Mr. <HI>Lid|dal</HI>
his cases of Conscience, but found that
Mr. <HI>Liddal</HI> did not Discourse after his ordi|nary
rate, which made him suspect whether
he was not imposed upon by a deceitful <HI>Dae|mon.</HI>
The next Day going to Mr. <HI>Liddal</HI>'s
House, he enquired whether he was with him
the Day before, Mr. <HI>Liddal</HI> told him that he
was not; then said Mr. <HI>Earl</HI> it was my Ene|my
<PB N="216" REF="124">
in your shape. What a miserable Man
am I, that know not when I speak with my
Enemy or with my Friend? To which Mr.
<HI>Liddal</HI> replied, if you would know when you
speak with a Spirit or with a Man, remember
and follow the advice of Christ; who when
he appeared to his Disciples after his Resurre|ction,
and they thought he had been a Spirit,
and were therefore troubled; he said to them,
<HI>handle me and see, for a Spirit hath not Flesh
and Bones as you see me have,</HI> Luk. 24. 39. This
Advice Mr. <HI>Earl</HI> followed. For not long af|ter
the Devil coming to him in Mr. <HI>Liddal</HI>'s
shape, he went to take hold on his Arms, but
could feel no substance, only a vanishing sha|dow.
It seems that this Mr. <HI>Earl</HI> was once
an <HI>Athiest,</HI> that did not believe that there was
either <HI>God</HI> or <HI>Devil,</HI> &amp; would often walk in
solitary and dismal places, wishing for the
sight of a Spirit; and that he was first assaul|ted
by a Devil in a Church-yard. And
though God mercifully gave him Repentance
yet he was miserably haunted with an evil
Spirit all his dayes. I find that Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in
his first <HI>Vol.</HI> of Examples, <HI>Chap. 104. P.</HI> 510.
hath some part of this strange Providence,
but he mentions not Mr. <HI>Earl</HI>'s Name. A
Gentleman worthy of credit affirmed this Re|lation
to be most certainly true, according to
<PB N="217" REF="124">
the particulars which have been declared. I
have thought it therefore not unworthy the
Publication.</P>
<P>There is another Remarkable Passage to
this purpose, which hapned of later years,
wherein the <HI>Turkish Chaous</HI> Baptized at <HI>Lon|don,
Ianuary 30. A. D.</HI> 1658. was concerned.
This <HI>Chaous</HI> being alone in his Chamber, 3. <HI>h.
P. M.</HI> a person in the likeness of Mr. <HI>Dury,</HI>
the Minister with whom he did most ordina|rily
converse, came and sat by him. This
seeming Mr. <HI>Dury</HI> told him, that he had wait|ed
with a great deal of patience as to the
matter of his Baptism; and that himself had
endeavoured by all means possible to procure
it, to be performed with publick Counte|nance;
and to that effect, had dealt with
<HI>Richard,</HI> and several of his Counsel, but
that now he perceived that it was in vain to
strive or wait longer. And therefore advised
him not to be much troubled at it, but setting
his mind at rest, to leave these thoughts, and
take up his resolution another way. When
the <HI>Chaous</HI> heard this Discourse, being much
perplexed in his Spirit, he lifted up his hands
and eyes to Heaven, uttering Words to this
effect. <HI>O my Lord Iesus Christ, what a mise|rable
thing is this, that a true Christian cannot
be owned by other Christians; that one who be|lieveth
<PB N="218" REF="125">
on thee cannot be Baptized into thy Name.</HI>
When he had so spoken, looking down, he
saw no body, the appearance of Mr. <HI>Dury</HI>
being vanished, which was at first an amaze|ment
to him; but recollecting himself, he
began to rejoyce, as hoping that Satan would
be disappointed of his Plot. About 8 <HI>h.</HI> at
night, the true Mr. <HI>Dury</HI> met with the <HI>Chaous</HI>
who acquainted him with what hapned to
him, so did he more fully understand how he
had been imposed upon by Satan. The men|tioned
Instances, are enough to prove that
the Devil may possibly appear in the shape of
good Men, and that not only of such as are
dead, but of the still living. It might as a
further confirmation of the truth we assert,
have been here noted, that the Devil doth
frequently amongst the <HI>Papists</HI> visibly appear,
pretending to be Christ himself, as their own
Authors do acknowledge. They affirm, that
he came in the shape of Christ to <HI>Pachomius</HI>
and to St. <HI>Martin.</HI> So hath he often appear|ed
in the Form of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> whereby
miserable Souls have been seduced into gross I|dolatries.
It is likewise reported, that when <HI>Lu|ther</HI>
had spent a Day in Fasting and Prayer,
there appeared to him one seeming to be
Christ; but <HI>Luther</HI> said to him, <HI>away thou confoun|ded
<PB N="219" REF="125">
Devil, I will have no Christ but what is in my
Bible,</HI> whereupon the Apparition vanished.
As for the Spirits of Men deceased, it is cer|tain
they cannot reassume their Bodies, nor
yet come to Men in this World when they
will, or without a permission from him, in
whose hand they are. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> in his se|cond
Sermon concerning <HI>Lazarus,</HI> saith that
<HI>Daemons</HI> would oftentimes appear, falsly pre|tending
themselves to be the Souls of some
lately dead. He saith, that he himself knew
many <HI>Daemoniacks,</HI> that the Spirits in them
would feign the voices of men lately killed,
and would discover the secrets of such Per|sons,
professing that they were the Souls of
those very men. But those were no other
then devilish lies. Upon which account men
had need be exceeding wary what credit they
give unto, or how they entertain communi|on
with such <HI>Spectres.</HI> I do not say that all
such Apparitions are Diabolical. Only that
many of them are so. And as yet I have not
met with any <GAP DESC="foreign"> whereby the certain
<HI>appearance</HI> of a Person Deceased, may be infal|libly
discerned from a meer Diabolical illu|sion.
The Rules of judging in this case de|scribed
by <HI>Malderus</HI> are very fallible.</P>
<P>As for the moving and procuring cause of
<PB N="220" REF="126">
such <HI>Apparitions,</HI> commonly it is by reason of
some sin not discoverable in any other way.
Either some act of injustice done, or it may
be some Murder committed. <HI>Platina, Nau|clerus,</HI>
and others relate, that Pope <HI>Benedict.</HI> 8.
did after his death appear sitting upon a black
Horse before a Bishop of his acquaintance,
declaring the reason to be, in that he had in
his life time nefariously consumed a great sum
of Money, which belonged to the Poor.
And there are fresh Examples to this purpose
lately published in the second Edition
of Mr. <HI>Glanvils Sadducismus Triumphatus.</HI>
He there speaks of a Man in <HI>Guilford,</HI>
unto whom belonged some Copy-hold
Land, which was to descend to his Children,
he dying, leaving no Child born, his Brother
took possession of the Estate. So it hapned
that the deceased Man's Wife conceived with
Child but a little before her Husbands death,
which after she perceived, by the Advice of
her Neighbours, she told her Brother in Law
how matters were circumstanced; he railed
upon her, calling her Whore, and said he
would not be fooled out of his Estate so.
The poor Woman went home troubled, that
not only her Child should lose the Land, but
which was worse, that she should be thought
an Whore. In due time she was Delivered
<PB N="221" REF="126">
of a Son. Some time after which, as her
Brother in Law was going out of the Field,
his dead Brother (the Father of the injured
Child) appeared to him at the Stile, and bid
him give up the Land to the Child, for it was
his Right. The Brother being greatly af|frighted
at this <HI>Spectre,</HI> ran away, and not
long after came to his Sister, saying, she had
sent the Devil to him, and bid her take the
Land; and her Son is now possessed of it.</P>
<P>The same Author relates, that the Wife of
Dr. <HI>Bretton</HI> of <HI>Deptford</HI> (being a person of
extraordinary Piety) did appear after her
Death. A Maid of hers, whose name was
<HI>Alice</HI> (for whom in her life time she had a
great kindness) Married a near Neighbour.
As this <HI>Alice</HI> was rocking her Infant in the
night, some one knocking at the door, she a|rose
and opened it, and was surprized by the
sight of a Gentlewoman, not to be distin|guished
from her late Mistriss. At the first
sight she expressed great amazement, and said
were not my Mistress dead I should conclude
you are she. The Apparition replied, I am
she which was your Mistriss; and withal ad|ded,
that she had a business of great impor|tance
to imploy her in, and that she must im|mediately
go a little way with her. <HI>Alice</HI>
trembled, and entreated her to go to her Ma|ster,
<PB N="222" REF="127">
who was fitter to be employed than she.
The seeming Mistriss replied, that she had
been in the Chamber of him who was once
her Husband, but he was asleep; nor had she
any Commission to awake him. <HI>Alice</HI> then
objected that her Child was apt to cry vehe|mently,
and should she leave it, some hurt
might come to him. The Apparition repli|ed,
the Child shall sleep until you return. See|ing
there was no avoiding it; <HI>Alice</HI> followed
her over the Style into a large Field, who
said, observe how much of this Field I mea|sure
with my feet, and when she had took a
good large leisurly compass, she said, <HI>all this
belongs to the Poor;</HI> it being gotten from them
by wrongful means, and charged her to go
and tell her Brother, whose it was at that time,
that he should give it up to the poor again
forthwith as he loved her and his Deceased
Mother. This Brother was not the person
that did this unjust act, but his Father. She
added, that she was the more concerned, be|cause
her Name was made use of in some
Writing that related to this Land. <HI>Alice</HI>
asked her how she should satisfie her Brother
that this was no Cheat or Delusion of her
Phansie? She replied, tell him this Secret
which he knows that only himself and I am
privy to, and he will believe you. <HI>Alice</HI> pro|mised
<PB N="223" REF="127">
her to go on this Errand. She enter|tained
her the rest of the night with divine
Discourse, and Heavenly Exhortations. But
when the twilight appeared, the <HI>Spectre</HI> said,
<HI>I must be seen by none but your self,</HI> and so Dis|appeared.
Immediately <HI>Alice</HI> makes hast
home, being thoughtful for her Child, but
found it as the <HI>Spectre</HI> said, fast asleep in the
Cradle. That Day she went to her Master,
the <HI>Doctor,</HI> who amazed at the account she
gave, sent her to his Brother in Law. He at
the first hearing of <HI>Alice</HI>'s Story, laughed at
it heartily; supposing her to be troubled with
strange whimsies. But then she told him of
the Secret, which her appearing Mistriss the
Gentleman's Sister, had revealed; upon
which he presently changed his countenance,
and told her he would give the Poor their
own, which accordingly he did, and they
now enjoy it. D. <HI>Bretton</HI> himself (being a
Person of great sincerity) gave a large Nar|rative
of his Wives Apparition, to several;
and amongst others to Dr. <HI>Whichcot.</HI> And
this Narrative was attested unto by Mr. <HI>Ed|ward
Fowler,</HI> Feb. 16. 1680. See Mr. <HI>Glan|vil</HI>'s
Collection of Relations, <HI>P.</HI> 197. In
the same Book, <HI>P.</HI> 243. He relates concern|ing
one <HI>Francis Taverner,</HI> that in <HI>September</HI>
1662. riding late at night from <HI>Hilbrough</HI> in
<PB N="224" REF="128">
<HI>Ireland</HI> there appeared to him one in the like|ness
of <HI>Iames Haddock,</HI> formerly an Inha|bitant
in <HI>Malone,</HI> where he Died five years
before. <HI>Taverner</HI> asked him who he was?
the <HI>Spectre</HI> replied, <HI>I am Iames Haddock;</HI> you
may call me to mind by this Token, that a|bout
five years ago, I and two other Friends
were at your Fathers house, and you by your
Fathers appointment brought us some Nuts,
therefore be not afraid. And told him if he
would ride along with him he would acquaint
him with a business he had to deliver to him.
Which <HI>Taverner</HI> refused to do; upon his go|ing
from the <HI>Spectre,</HI> he heard hideous scrie|ches
and noises, to his great amazement. The
night after there appeared again to him, the
likeness of <HI>Iames Haddock;</HI> telling him,
that the Woman, who had been his Wife,
when living; was now Married unto one
<HI>Davis</HI> in <HI>Malone;</HI> and that the said <HI>Davis</HI>
and his Wife wronged the Son of <HI>Iames
Haddock;</HI> and that the Will of <HI>Haddock,</HI> who
had given a Lease to his Son, was not fulfilled;
and therefore he desired <HI>Taverner</HI> to acquaint
them therewith, and to see his Son righted.
<HI>Taverner</HI> neglected to deliver his message,
whereupon the <HI>Spectre</HI> appeared again unto
him in divers formidable shapes, threatning
to tear him in pieces, if he did not do as he
<PB N="225" REF="128">
was required. This made him leave his
House where he dwelt in the Mountains and
remove to the Town of <HI>Belfast,</HI> where it
appeared to him again in the house of one
<HI>Pierce,</HI> severely threatning of him. Upon
which <HI>Taverner</HI> being much troubled in his
Spirit, acquainted some of his Friends with
his perplexity. They take Advice from Dr.
<HI>Downs,</HI> then Minister in <HI>Belfast.</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Iames South,</HI> Chaplain to the Lord <HI>Chichester,</HI>
who went with <HI>Taverner</HI> to the house of <HI>Da|vis,</HI>
and in their presence he declared to her,
that he could not be quiet for the Ghost of
her former Husband <HI>Iames Haddock,</HI> who
threatned to tear him in pieces, if he did not
tell her she must right <HI>Iohn Haddock</HI> her Son
by him, in a Lease wherein she and <HI>Davis</HI>
her now Husband had wronged him. Two
nights after the <HI>Spectre</HI> came to him again,
looking pleasantly upon him, asking if he
had done the message? He answered, he
had. Then he was told, he must do the
like to the Executors. The Day following
Dr. <HI>Ieremie Taylor</HI> Bishop of <HI>Down, Conner,</HI>
and <HI>Dromore,</HI> being to keep Court at <HI>Dro|more;</HI>
ordered his Secretary <HI>(Thomas Alcock)</HI>
to send for <HI>Taverner,</HI> who accordingly came,
and was strictly examined. The Bishop ad|vised
him, the next time the <HI>Spectre</HI> appeared
<PB N="226" REF="129">
to him, to ask him these Questions: <HI>When<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
are you? Are you a good or a bad Spirit? where
is your abode? what station do you hold? How
are you Regimented in the other World? And
what is the reason that you appear for the relief
of your Son in so small a matter, when so many
Widows and Orphans are oppressed in the World,
and none of their Relations appear as you do to
right them?</HI> That night <HI>Taverner</HI> lodged at
my Lord <HI>Conways,</HI> where he saw the <HI>Spectre</HI>
coming over a Wall; and approaching near
to him, asked if he had done his Message
to the Executor also? He replied, he had,
and wondred that he should be still troubled.
The Apparition bid him not be afraid, for it
would not hurt him, nor appear to him any
more, but to the Executor, if the Orphan
were not righted. <HI>Taverners</HI> Brother being
by, put him in mind to propound the Bishops
Questions to the Spirit. Which he did; but
the <HI>Spectre</HI> gave no answer to them; only
seemed to crawl on his hands and feet
over the Wall again, and vanished with a
melodious Harmony. The pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sons concern|ed
about the Lease (much against their wills)
disposed of it for the use of <HI>Haddock</HI>'s Son,
only for fear lest the <HI>Apparition</HI> should molest
them also. Thus concerning this. Before
I pass to the next Relation, I cannot but
<PB N="227" REF="129">
Animadvert upon what is here expressed,
concerning the Questions which the Bishop
would needs have propounded to, and resol|ved
by this <HI>Spectre.</HI> I am perswaded, that the
Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> who speaks of a Mans <HI>intru|ding
into those things which he hath not seen,
Col.</HI> 2. 18. would hardly have given such
counsel as the Bishop did. One of his Que|stions,
(viz. <HI>Are you a good or a bad Spirit?)</HI>
seems to be a needless and impertinent enqui|ry.
For good Angels never appear in the
shape of dead Men; but evil and wicked
Spirits have oftentimes done so. His other
<HI>Queries</HI> favour too much of vain curiosity.
They bring to mind what is by that great Hi|storian
<HI>Thuanus (Lib. 130. Page</HI> 1136.) re|ported
concerning <HI>Peter Cotten</HI> the Jesuit, who
having a great desire to be satisfied about
some Questions which no Man living could
resolve him in; he applied himself to a Maid
who was possessed with a Devil, charging
the Spirit in her to resolve his Proposals.
Some of which were relating to this World,
<HI>e. g.</HI> He desired the Devil, if he could, to tell
him when <HI>Calvinism</HI> would be extinguished;
And what would be the most effectual means
to turn the Kingdome of <HI>England</HI> from the
Protestant to the Popish Religion. What
would be the issue of the Wars and great
<PB N="228" REF="130">
designs then on foot in the World? Other
of his Enquiries respected the <HI>Old World, e. g.</HI>
How <HI>Noah</HI> could take the living Creatures
that were brought into the Ark? Who those
Sons of God were that loved the Daughters
of Men? Whether Serpents went upon feet
before <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some of his Que|stions
respected <HI>the other World;</HI> He would
have the Spirit to resolve him, How long the
fallen Angels were in Heaven before they
were cast down from thence? And what is
the most evident place in the Scripture to
prove that there is a Purgatory? Who are the
seven Spirits that stand before the Throne of
God? Who is the King of the Arch-An|gels?
Where Paradise is? Now let the Rea|der
judge whether D. <HI>Taylors</HI> Questions, when
he would have the <HI>Spectre</HI> resolve him, <HI>Where
is your abode? What station do you hold? How
are you Regimented in the other World?</HI> &amp;c. be
not as curious as some of these of the Jesuits.
Wise men thought it tended much to the dis|reputation
of <HI>Peter Cotton</HI> when through his
incogitant leaving the Book wherein his en|quiries
of the <HI>Daemon</HI> were written with a
Friend; the matter came to be divulged. I
cannot think that Dr. <HI>Taylors</HI> Secretary his
publishing these curiosities of his Lord, hath
added much to his credit amongst sober and
<PB N="229" REF="130">
judicious Persons. There is a Tragical pas|sage
related in the Story of the <HI>Daemon</HI> which
for three Moneths molested the House of Mr.
<HI>Perreaud</HI> a Protestant Minister in <HI>Matiscon.</HI>
One in the Room would needs be propound|ing
needless Questions for the Devil to An|swer,
though Mr. <HI>Perreaud</HI> told him of the
danger in it. After a deal of discourse; the
Devil said to him, <HI>You should have hearkened
to the Ministers good counsel, who told you that
you ought not to ask curious Questions of the De|vil,
yet you would do it, and now I must school,
you for your pains.</HI> Presently upon which, the
Man was by an invisible hand plucked up by
his Thumb, and twirled round, and thrown
down upon the floor, and so continued in
most grievous misery. I hope then, that
none will be emboldened from the Bishops
Advice, to enquire at the mouth of <HI>Devils</HI> or
of Apparitions, until such time as they know
whether they are <HI>Devils</HI> or no. But to pass
on. That the Ghosts of dead persons have
sometimes appeared that so the sin of Mur|der
(as well as that of Theft) might be dis|covered,
is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">hing notoriously known. I
shall only mention two or three Examples for
this; and the rather because some who are
very unapt to believe things of this nature,
yet have given credit to those Relations. Two
<PB N="230" REF="131">
of the Stories are recited by Mr. <HI>Webster</HI> in
his Book of Witchcraft.</P>
<Q><P>He saith, <HI>(P.</HI> 298.) that about the Year
1623. one <HI>Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Rascal,</HI> a Town in
the North-Riding of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> a Yeoman of
a good Estate married a Woman from <HI>Thorn|ton
Brigs,</HI> who had formerly been naught
with one <HI>Ralph Raynard,</HI> who kept an Inn,
within half a mile from <HI>Rascal,</HI> in the high
Road betwixt <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Thuske,</HI> his Sister li|ving
with him; this <HI>Raynard</HI> continuing in
unlawful Lust with <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Wife, and not
being content therewith, conspired the
death of <HI>Fletcher;</HI> one <HI>Mark Dunn</HI> being
made privy, and hired to assist in the Mur|ther;
which <HI>Raynard</HI> and <HI>Dunn</HI> accompli|shed
upon <HI>May Day,</HI> by drowning him, as
they were Travelling all three together,
from a Town called <HI>Huby,</HI> and acquainted
the Wife with the deed, she gave them a
Sack, therein to convey his Body, which
they did, and buried it in <HI>Raynard</HI>'s back
side, or <HI>Croft,</HI> where an old Oak had been
stubbed up, and sowed Mustard-seed in the
place, thereby to hide it; they then conti|nued
their wicked course of Lust and
Drunkenness; and the Neighbours did
much wonder at <HI>Fletchers</HI> absence, but his
Wife excused it, and said, <HI>he was only gone
<PB N="231" REF="131">
aside for fear of some Writs being served upon
him,</HI> and so it continued till about <HI>Iuly</HI> 7<HI>th.</HI>
after, when <HI>Raynard</HI> going to <HI>Topcliff-Fair,</HI>
and setting up his Horse in the Stable, the
Spirit of <HI>Fletcher</HI> in his usual shape and ha|bit,
did appear unto him, and said, O <HI>Ralph,
Repent, Repent, for my Revenge is at hand;</HI>
and ever after, until he was put in the Goal
the Spirit seemed continually to stand be|fore
him, whereby he became sad and rest|less,
and his own Sister over-hearing his
Confession and Relation of it to another
person, did through fear of losing her own
life, immediately reveal it to Sr. <HI>William
Sheffield,</HI> who lived in <HI>Rascal;</HI> whereupon
<HI>Raynard, Dunn,</HI> and the Wife, were all three
apprehended, and sent to the Goal at <HI>York,</HI>
where they were Condemned and Execu|ted,
near the place where <HI>Raynard</HI> lived; and
<HI>Fletcher</HI> was buried; the two Men being
hung up in Chains, and the Woman burn|ed
under the Gallows. I have recited this
Story punctually, as a thing that hath been
very much fixed on my Memory (being
then but young) and a certain Truth, I
being (with many more) an Ear-witness
of their Confessions, and eye-witness of
their Executions, and likewise saw <HI>Fletcher</HI>
when he was taken up, where they had
<PB N="232" REF="132">
buried him in his Clothes, which were a
green Fustian Doublet pinckt upon white,
and his walking Boots, and brass Spurs,
without Rowels. Thus Mr. <HI>Webster.</HI></P><P>Again, the same Author <HI>(P.</HI> 308.) relates
that about the Year 1632. there lived one
<HI>Walker,</HI> near <HI>Chester,</HI> who was a Yeoman of
a good Estate, and a Widower; he had a
young Kins-woman to keep his House, who
was by the Neighbours suspected to be with
Child, and was sent away one Evening in
the dark, with one <HI>Mark Sharp</HI> a Collier,
and was not heard of, nor little notice ta|ken
of her, till a long time after one <HI>Iames
Grayham</HI> a Miller, who lived two Miles
from <HI>Walker</HI>'s House, being one night a|lone
very late in his Mill, grinding Corn, a|bout
twelve a Clock at night, the Doors
being shut, there stood a Woman in the
midst of the Floor, with her hair hanging
down all bloody, and five large Wounds in
her head; he was very much frighted, yet
had the courage to ask her who she was, and
what she wanted? to whom she answered,
<HI>I am the Spirit of such a Woman, who lived
with</HI> Walker, <HI>and being got with Child by
him, he promised to send me to a private place,
where I should be well lookt to, till I was brought
<PB N="233" REF="132">
a Bed, and well, and then I should come again
and keep his House, and accordingly</HI> (said the
Apparition) <HI>I was one night late sent away
with one</HI> Mark Sharp, <HI>who upon a Moor,</HI> (na|ming
a place which the Miller knew) <HI>slew
me with a Pick</HI> (such as Men dig Coals
withal) <HI>and gave me these five Wounds, and
after threw my Body into a Coal-pit hard by,
and hid the Pick under the Bank, and his shoes
and stockins being bloody, he endeavoured to
wash them, but seeing the blood would not wash
off, he left them there;</HI> And the Apparition
further told the Miller, <HI>That he must be the
Man to reveal it, or else she must still appear
and haunt him.</HI> The Miller returned home
very sad, and heavy, but spake not one word
of what he had seen, yet eschewed as much
as he could to stay in the Mill in the night
without company, thinking thereby to e|scape
the seeing this dreadful Apparition;
But notwithstanding, one night when it
began to be dark, the Apparition met him
again, and seemed very fierce and cruel,
threatning him, that if he did not reveal the
Murder, she would continually pursue and
haunt him; yet for all this, he still concea|led
it, until St. <HI>Thomas</HI> Eve before <HI>Christmas,</HI>
when being soon after Sun-set walking in
his Garden, she appeared again, and then so
<PB N="234" REF="133">
threatned and affrighted him, that he pro|mised
faithfully to reveal it the next morn|ing:
In the morning he went unto a Ma|gistrate,
and discovered the whole matter,
with all the circumstances, and diligent
search being made, the Body was found in
a Cole-pit, with five wounds in the head,
and the Pick, and Shoes, and Stockins yet
bloody, and in every circumstance as the
Apparition had related to the Miller<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;
Whereupon <HI>Walker</HI> and <HI>Mark Sharp</HI> were
both apprehended, but would confess no|thing.
At the Assizes following, (I think
it was at <HI>Durham)</HI> they were arraigned,
found guilty, and Hanged; but I could ne|ver
hear that they confessed the Fact. It
was reported that the <HI>Apparition</HI> did appear
to the Judge, or the Fore-man of the Jury,
but of that I know no certainty. There
are many persons yet alive that can remem|ber
this strange Murder, and I saw and
read the Letter which was sent to Serjeant
<HI>Hutton</HI> about it, from the Judge before
whom they were tried, which maketh me
relate it with greater <HI>confidence.</HI> Thus far
we have Mr. <HI>Webster</HI>'s Relations.</P></Q>
<P>It is also credibly Attested that a thing no
less Remarkable than either of the former,
hapned but nine years ago at another place
<PB N="235" REF="133">
in <HI>England.</HI> The sum of the Story as it is
published in Mr. <HI>Glanvil</HI>'s Collection of Re|lations,
<HI>P.</HI> 172. is this: On the ninth of
<HI>November 1674. Thomas Goddard</HI> of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI>
in the Country of <HI>Wilts,</HI> as he was go|ing
to <HI>Ogborn,</HI> about 9. <HI>h. A. M.</HI> he met the
Apparition of his Father in Law <HI>Edward
Avon,</HI> who had beed dead about half a year.
He seemed to stand by the Stile, which <HI>God|dard</HI>
was to go over. When he came near,
the <HI>Spectre</HI> spake to him with an audible
voice, saying, <HI>Are you afraid?</HI> to whom he
answered, I am, thinking of one who is
dead and buried, whom you are like. To
which the Apparition replied, <HI>I am be;</HI> come
near me I will do you no harm; to which
<HI>Goddard</HI> replied, I trust in him who hath
bought my Soul with his precious blood, you
shall do me no harm. Then the <HI>Spectre</HI> said,
how stand cases at home? <HI>Goddard</HI> askt what
cases? Then it asked him, how doth <HI>William</HI>
and <HI>Mary?</HI> meaning belike, his Son <HI>William</HI>
and his Daughter <HI>Mary,</HI> whom this <HI>Goddard</HI>
had married. And it said, What? <HI>Taylor</HI> is
Dead; meaning as <HI>Goddard</HI> thought, one of
that Name in <HI>London,</HI> who had married ano|ther
of <HI>Avon</HI>'s Daughters, and died in <HI>Sep|tember</HI>
before this. The <HI>Spectre</HI> offered him
some Money, desiring it might be sent to
<PB N="236" REF="134">
his Daughter that was lately become a Wi|dow;
but <HI>Goddard</HI> answered, <HI>In the Name of
Iesus Christ I refuse all such Money.</HI> Then the
Apparition said, I perceive you are afraid, I
will meet you some other time: so it went
away. The next night about 7 <HI>h.</HI> it came
and opened his Shop-Window, and looked
him in the face, but said nothing. And the
next night after as <HI>Goddard</HI> went into his
back-side with a Candle light in his hand, but
he being affrighted ran into his House, and
saw it no more at that time. But on Thurs|day
<HI>November</HI> 12. as he came from <HI>Chilton,</HI>
the Apparition met him again, and stood (a|bout
eight foot) directly before him, and
said with a loud voice, <HI>Thomas,</HI> bid <HI>William
Avon</HI> take the Sword which he had of me,
which is now in his House, and carry to the
wood as we goe to <HI>Alton</HI> to the upper end of
the wood by the wayes side, for with that
sword I did wrong above thirty years ago,
&amp; he never prospered since twas his. And do
you speak with <HI>Edward Lawrence,</HI> and I desire
you to pay him twenty shillings out of the
Money which you received of <HI>Iames Eliot</HI>
at two payments; for I borrowed so much
Money of <HI>Edward Lawrence,</HI> and said that I
had paid him, but I did not pay it him. This
Money was received of <HI>Iames Eliot</HI> on a
<PB N="237" REF="134">
Bond due to <HI>Avon</HI> and <HI>Goddard</HI> had it at two
Payments after <HI>Avon</HI> had been Dead several
Moneths. <HI>Lawrence</HI> saith that he lent <HI>Avon</HI>
twenty shillings in Money about twenty years
ago, which was never paid him again. <HI>No|vember
23. Goddard</HI> did by Order from
the Mayor of the Town, go with his Bro|ther
in Law <HI>William Avon,</HI> with the Sword
to the place where the Apparition said it
should be carried. And coming away thence
<HI>Goddard</HI> looking back saw the same Appari|tion,
whereupon he called to his Brother in
Law, and said, Here is the Apparition of your
Father; <HI>William</HI> replied, I see nothing, then
<HI>Goddard</HI> fell on his Knees, and said, Lord,
open his eyes that he may see. But <HI>William</HI>
said, Lord grant I may not see it, if it be thy
blessed Will. Then the Ghost did to <HI>God|dard</HI>'s
apprehension becken with his hand.
To whom <HI>Goddard</HI> said, what would you have
me to do? the Apparition replied, take up
the Sword and follow me. To which he
said, should both of us come? or but one of
us? The <HI>Spectre</HI> replied, <HI>Thomas</HI> do you take
up the Sword. So he took it up and followed
the Apparition about ten poles into the wood.
Then the <HI>Spectre</HI> coming towards <HI>Goddard</HI> he
stept back two steps; but it said to him, <HI>I
have a permission to you, and a commission not to
<PB N="238" REF="135">
touch you.</HI> Then it took the Sword, and wen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
to the place at which before it stood, and
pointed the top of the Sword into the ground
and said, In this place was buried the Body
of him whom I Murdered in the Year 1635.
but it is now rotten and turned to Dust.
Whereupon <HI>Goddard</HI> said, For what cause did
you Murder him? The seeming <HI>Avon</HI> replied
I took Money from the Man, and he con|tended
with me, and so I Murdered him.
Then <HI>Goddard</HI> said, who was confederate
with you in the Murder? the <HI>Spectre</HI> Answe|red,
none but my self. What (said <HI>Goddard)</HI>
would you have me do in this thing? The
Apparition replied, Only to let the World
know that I Murdered a Man, and buried
him in this place, in the year 1635. Then
the <HI>Spectre</HI> laid down the Sword on the bare
ground there, whereupon grew nothing, but
seemed to <HI>Goddard</HI> to be as a Grave sunk in.
All this while <HI>William Avon</HI> remained where
<HI>Goddard</HI> left him, and said he saw no Appa|rition,
only heard <HI>Goddard</HI> speak to the
<HI>Spectre,</HI> and discerned another voice also, ma|king
Reply to <HI>Goddard's</HI> enquiries, but could
not understand the words uttered by that
voice. The next day the Mayor caused
men to dig in the place where the <HI>Spectre</HI>
said the Body was buried, but nothing could
<PB N="239" REF="135">
be found. These examples then, shew that
the Ghosts of Dead men do sometimes ap|pear,
and that for such causes as those men|tioned.
There have been some in the world
so desperate as to make solemn Covenants
with their living Friends, to appear unto them
after their Death; and sometimes (though
not alwayes) it hath so come to pass. It is
a Remarkable passage which <HI>Baronius</HI> relates
concerning <HI>Marsilius Ficinus,</HI> and his great
Intimate <HI>Michael Mercatus.</HI> These two ha|ving
been warmly Disputing about the im|mortality
of the Soul, entred into a solemn
Vow, that if there were truth in those No|tions
about a future State in another World,
he which died first should appear to his sur|viving
Friend. Not long after this, <HI>Ficinus</HI>
Died. On a morning when <HI>Mercatus</HI> was
intent upon his Studies, he heard the voice of
<HI>Ficinus</HI> his Friend at his Window with a loud
cry, saying, O <HI>Michael, Michael, Vera, vera
sunt illa:</HI> O my Friend <HI>Michael,</HI> those noti|ons
about the Souls of Men being immortal
they are true, they are true. Whereupon,
<HI>Mercatus</HI> opened his Window, and saw his
Friend <HI>Marsilius Ficinus,</HI> whom he called un|to,
but he vanished away. He presently sent
to <HI>Florence</HI> to know how <HI>Ficinus</HI> did, and was
informed that he Died about the hour when
<PB N="240" REF="136">
his Ghost appeared at <HI>Mercatus</HI> his Window.
There are also later Instances, and nearer
home, not altogether unlike to this. For in
Mr. <HI>Glanvil</HI>'s late Collection of Relations,
(which we have had occasion more than once
to mention.) It is said, that Dr. <HI>Farrar</HI> and
his Daughter, made a compact, that the first
of them which Died, if happy, should after
Death appear to the surviver if possible; his
Daughter with some difficulty consenting to
the agreement. Some time after, the Daugh|ter
living then near <HI>Salisbury,</HI> fell in Labour,
and having by an unhappy mistake a noxious
Potion given to her, instead of another pre|pared,
suddenly Died. That very night she
appeared in the room where her Father then
Lodged in <HI>London,</HI> and opening the Curtains
looked upon him. He had before heard no|thing
of her illness, but upon this Apparition
confidently told his Servant that his Daughter
was Dead, and two Dayes after received the
News. Likewise one Mr. <HI>Watkinson,</HI> who
lived in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> told his Daughter (taking
her leave of him, and expressing her fears that
she should never see him more) that should
he Die, if ever God did permit the Dead to
to see the living, he would see her again. Now
after he had been Dead about half a Year;
on a night when she was in <HI>Bed</HI> but could
<PB N="241" REF="136">
not sleep, she heard Musick, and the Cham|ber
grew lighter and lighter, she then saw her
Father by the Bed-side. Who said <HI>Mall,</HI> did
not I tell thee that I would see thee again?
He exhorted her to be patient under her af|flictions,
and to carry it dutiful towards her
Mother; and told her that her Child that
was born since his departure should not trou|ble
her long. And bid her speak what
she would speak to him now, for he must go
and she should see him no more upon Earth,
<HI>Vid. Glanvil</HI>'s Collections, <HI>P.</HI> 189, 192. Some|times
the Great and Holy God, hath permit|ted,
and by his Providence ordered such <HI>Ap|paritions</HI>
to the end that <HI>Atheists</HI> might there|by
be astonished and affrighted out of their
Infidelity.</P>
<Q>Nam primus timor fecit in orbe Deos.</Q>
<P>Remarkable and very solemn is the Rela|on
of the Appearance of Major <HI>Sydenbam</HI>'s
Ghost, mentioned in the Book but now cited
<HI>(P.</HI> 181.) It is in brief this. Major <HI>George
Sydenham</HI> of <HI>Delverton</HI> in <HI>Somerset,</HI> and Cap|tain
<HI>William Dyke</HI> of <HI>Skillgate</HI> in that County;
used to have many Disputes about the Being
of God, and the Immortality of the Soul:
in which point they continued unresolved.
<PB N="242" REF="137">
To issue their controversies, they agreed that
he that died first should the third night after
his Funeral, between the hours of twelve and
one, appear at a little House in the Garden.
After <HI>Sydenham</HI> was dead, Captain <HI>Dyke</HI> re|pairs
to the place appointed between them
two. He acquainted a near Kinsman, Dr.
<HI>Thomas Dyke</HI> with his design, by whom he
was earnestly disswaded from going to that
place at that time; and was told, that the
Devil might meet him and be his ruine, if he
would venture on in such rash attempts. The
Captain Replied, that he had solemnly en|gaged,
and nothing should discourage him;
accordingly betwixt twelve and one he went
into the Garden-house, and there tarried two
or three hours, without seeing or hearing any
thing more than what was usual. About six
weeks after, Captain <HI>Dyke</HI> rides to <HI>Eaton,</HI> to
place his Son a Scholar there. The morn|ing
before he returned from thence, after it
was light, one came to his Bed-side, and sud|denly
drawing back the Curtains, calls <HI>Cap.
Cap.</HI> (which was the term of familiarity which
the <HI>Major</HI> when living used to call the <HI>Captain</HI>
by) He presently perceived it was his <HI>Major,</HI>
and replieth, <HI>What my Major!</HI> On the Table
in the Room there lay a Sword which the
<HI>Major</HI> had formerly given to the <HI>Captain.</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="137">
After the seeming <HI>Major</HI> had walked a turn
or two about the Room, he took up the
Sword, and drew it out, and not finding it
so bright and clean as it ought, <HI>Cap. Cap.</HI> (said
he) <HI>This Sword did not use to be kept after this
manner, when it was mine.</HI> He also said to
the Captain, <HI>I could not come to you at the time
appointed, but I am now come to tell you, That
there is a God, and that he is a very just and a
terrible God, and if you do not turn over a new
leaf, you will find it so.</HI> So did he suddenly
disappear. The Captain arose, and came in|to
another Chamber (where his Kinsman
Dr. <HI>Dyke</HI> lodged) but in a visage and form
much differing from himself, his Hair stand|ing,
his Eyes staring, and his whole Body
trembling, telling with much affection what
he had seen. The Captain lived about two
years after this, but was much altered in his
Conversation, the Words uttered by his <HI>Ma|jors</HI>
Ghost, ever sounding in his Ears. Thus
of that remarkable Providence.</P>
<P>I have not mentioned these things, as any
way approving of such desperate Covenants.
There is great hazard attending them. It
may be after Men have made such agree|ments,
Devils may appear to them, pretend|ing
to be their Deceased Friends, and thereby
their Souls may be drawn into woful Snares&punc;
<PB N="244" REF="138">
Who knoweth whether God will permit the
persons, who have thus confederated, to ap|pear
in this World again after their Death,
and if not then the Surviver will be under
great temptation unto Atheism; As it fell
out with the late <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Rochester,</HI> who (as
is reported in his life, <HI>P.</HI> 16. by Dr. <HI>Burn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t)</HI>
did in the Year 1665. enter into a formal
ingagement with another Gentleman, not
without Ceremonies of Religion, that if
either of them Died, he should appear and
give the other notice of the future state, if
there were any. After this the other Gen|tleman
was killed, but did never appear after
his Death to the Earl of <HI>Rochester,</HI> which was
a great snare to him, during the rest of his
Life. Though when God awakened the
<HI>Earl</HI>'s Conscience upon his Death-bed, he
could not but acknowledge, that one who had
so corrupted the natural Principles of Truth
as he had, had no reason to expect that such
an extraordinary thing should be done for his
Conviction. Or if such agreement should
necessitate an Apparition, how would the
World be confounded with <HI>Spectres?</HI> How
many would probably be scared out of their
Wits? or what curious Questions would vain
Men be proposing about things which are
(and it is meet they should be) hid from Mor|tals.
<PB N="245" REF="138">
I cannot think that Men who make
such Covenants (except it be with very
much caution, as I have heard that Mr.
<HI>Knewstubs</HI> and another eminent Person did)
are duely mindful of that Scripture, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.
29. <HI>The secret things belong to the Lord; but
those things which are revealed belong to us.</HI>
Moreover, such sights are not desirable. For
many times they appear as forerunners of no|table
Judgements at hand. I could instance
out of approved History, how particular Fa|milies
have found that things of this nature,
have come to them as the Messengers of
Death. <HI>Lavater</HI> in his Book <HI>De Spectris,</HI>
and <HI>Goulartius</HI> in his Select History, say, that
<HI>Spectres</HI> are the Harbingers of publick Mu|tations,
Wars, and Calamitous times. <HI>Voetius</HI>
in his Disputation <HI>De Peste,</HI> sheweth that
sometimes the Plague or strange Diseases
follow after such Appearances. There was
lately a very formidable <HI>Apparition</HI> at <HI>Meenen&punc;</HI>
We are advised, that there did appear in that
place, a person all in white, with a Mitre on
his head, being followed with two more in
black; after him came four or five Squadrons,
who drew up as if they intended to storm
the Town. The Souldiers there refused to
stand their Centry, having been so affrighted
as that some of them fell down in their posts.
<PB N="246" REF="139">
These <HI>Spectres</HI> appeared every night in <HI>Iune,</HI>
1682. How it is there since that, or what e|vents
have followed in that place, I know not&punc;
But I find in credible Authors, that often|times
Mischief and Destruction unto some
or other hath been the effect of Apparitions.
<HI>Luther</HI> tells us of a Shepherd (of whom also
he speaketh charitably) that being haunted
with a Spirit; the <HI>Apparition</HI> told him, that
after eight dayes he would appear to him a|gain,
and carry him away, and kill him; and
so it came to pass: the Ministers whom the
poor man acquainted with his sorrowful e|state,
advised him not to despair of the Sal|vation
of his Soul, though God should suffer
the Devil to kill his Body. I have read of
threescore Persons all killed at once by an
<HI>Apparition. George Agricola</HI> giveth an ac|count
of twelve Men, that as they were dig|ging
in the Mines, a <HI>Spectre</HI> slew them.
Some have been filled with such Anxiety at
the appearance of a Spectre, that in one
nights time the Hair of their heads has
turned white. <HI>Lavater</HI> speaketh of a Man,
who one night meeting with an Apparition,
the terror of it caused such a sudden change
in him, as that when he came home, his own
Children did not know him. We may then
conclude that the <HI>Witlings</HI> of this <HI>Drolling
<PB N="247" REF="139">
age</HI> know not what they do, when they make
themselves sport with subjects of this nature.
I shall only add this further here, that from
the things which have been related, it is evi|dent
that they are mistaken who suppose De|vils
cannot appear to Men except with some
deformities whereby they are easily discove|red.
The <HI>Nymphs</HI> which deluded many of

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Several <HI>Cases</HI> of <HI>Conscience</HI> considered. That
it is not lawful to make use of Herbs or Plants
to drive away evil Spirits. Nor of Words or
Characters. An Objection answered. Whether
it be lawful for Persons bewitched, to burn things
or to nail Horse-shoes before their doors, or to stop
Urin in Bottles, or the like, in order to the reco|very
of Health. The Negative proved by seve|ral
Arguments. Whether it be lawful to try
Witches by casting them into the Water. Seve|ral
reasons evincing the vanity of that way of
<HI>Probation.</HI> Some other <HI>Superstitions</HI> witnes|sed
against.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe preceding Relations about <HI>witchcrafts</HI>
and <HI>Diabolical Impostures</HI> give us too
just occasion to make enquiry into some
<HI>Cases of Conscience,</HI> respecting things of this
Nature. And in the first place the <HI>Quaere</HI>
may be;</P>
<P><HI>Whither it is lawful to make use of any sort
of Herbs or Plants to preserve from Witchcrafts,
or from the power of Evil Spirits?</HI> The An|swer
unto which is; That it is in no wise
lawful, but that all attempts of that nature
are Magical, and Diabolical, and therefore
<PB N="249" REF="140">
detestable Superstition. As appears 1. In
that if the <HI>Devils</HI> do either operate or cease
to do mischief upon the use of such things it
must needs be in that they are signs which
give notice to the Evil Spirits what they are
to do; Now for Men to submit to any of the
<HI>Devils</HI> Sacraments is implicitly to make a co|venant
with him. Many who practise these
ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">arious Vanities little think what they do.
They would not for the World (they say)
make a Covenant with the <HI>Devil,</HI> yet by im|proving
the <HI>Devils signals,</HI> with an opinion
of receiving benefit thereby, they do the
thing which they pretend to abhor. For,
2. Angels (bad as well as good) are by na|ture
incorporeal Substances. There are some
Authors who by a <HI>corporal substance</HI> intend
no more but a <HI>real being;</HI> so that the term is
by them used in opposition to <HI>meer Phantasms</HI>
in that sence, none but <HI>Sadduces</HI> will deny
Angels to be Corporeal. And in that re|spect
the Antient <HI>Doctors, Tertullian</HI> and o|thers
call them <HI>Corpora.</HI> But commonly a
Body is set in opposition to a meer Spiritual
Substance, <HI>Mat. 10. 28. Heb.</HI> 12. 13. And thus
it is certain that <HI>Daemons</HI> are <HI>incorporeal,</HI> Eph.
6. 12. they are frequently, not only by Au|thors,
but in the Holy Scripture stiled <HI>Spirits,</HI>
because of their being incorporeal. And
<PB N="250" REF="141">
thence it is that they are not visible or palpa|ble
or any way incurring the outward sences,
<HI>Luk. 24. 39. Homer</HI> saith that when the Ghost
of <HI>Anticlea</HI> appeared to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> he attempted
three times to embrace that Image, but could
feel nothing; for it had not <GAP DESC="foreign">,
but as <HI>Virgil</HI> expresseth it, <HI>Tenues sine corporevi|tas.
Cajetan</HI> &amp; <HI>Vasquez</HI> affirm, that Apparitions
can at no time be felt. It is not to be doubt|ed
but that Spirits may make use of <HI>vehicles,</HI>
that are subject to the outward senses; never|theless,
a meer Spirit cannot be touched by
humane hands. Moreover, we read of a Le|gion
of <HI>Daemons</HI> possessing one miserable Bo|dy,
<HI>Luk.</HI> 8. 30. A Legion is at least 6000;
now if they were corporeal Substances, it
could not be that so many of them, should be
in the same person at the same time. And if
they are incorporeal Substances, then it is
not possible that Herbs or any sensible ob|jects
should have a natural influence upon
them, as they have upon Elementary Bodies.
This Argument is of such weight, as that <HI>Por|phyrius,</HI>
&amp; other heathenish Authors who affirm
that <HI>Daemons</HI> are affected with smells, &amp; with
blood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Suppose them to have aereal bodies.
So do some <HI>Talmudical</HI> &amp; <HI>Cabalistical</HI> Writers;
they hold that there are a middle sort of De|vils,
made of Fire and Air, who live upon
<PB N="251" REF="141">
the Liquidity of the Air, and the smoke of
fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These they call <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Munster</HI> in
his Notes on <HI>Lev.</HI> 17. does out of <HI>R. Abraham,</HI>
cite many passages to this purpose. But such
<HI>Iewish Fables</HI> are so foolish, as that they need
no confutation. And as the Argument we
have mentioned is a sufficient refutation of
them that imagine a natural vertue to be in
Herbs, whereby Evil Spirits are driven away;
so may it be improved against their Supersti|tion,
who suppose that Fumes are of force to
expel <HI>Daemons.</HI> The Author of the Book
of <HI>Tobit</HI> Chap. 6. tells a Tale, that the heart
and Liver of a Fish, if a smoke be made
therewith, the Devil will smell it, and then be
forced to flee away <HI>from any one</HI> that shall be
troubled with an Evil Spirit; and that <HI>Tobit</HI>
following the counsel which <HI>Raphael</HI> gave him
about these matters, the Devil was fain to
run for it, as far as to the utmost parts of <HI>Ae|gypt,
Chap. 8, ver.</HI> 2, 3. This passage, is so far
from being divine, as that indeed it is Pro|phane
and Magical. Whereas the <HI>Author</HI> saith,
that <HI>whoever</HI> is troubled with an Evil Spirit,
shall by that means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ind relief, he does expresly
contradict the Son of God, who has taught
otherwise, <HI>Mat. 17. 21. Mark</HI> 9. 28. And his
ascribing such vertue to the heart of a Fish, is
as true as what <HI>Cornelius Agrippa</HI> saith, who
<PB N="252" REF="142">
affirms that the Gall of a black Dog will
drive away Evil Spirits, and free from Witch|crafts.
And there is as much credit to be gi|ven
to these things as to another <HI>Iewish Fable,
viz.</HI> that the clapping of a Cocks Wings will
make the power of <HI>Daemons</HI> to become in|effectual;
yet that this Fable hath obtained
too much credit in the World is evident by
words of <HI>Prudentius,</HI> who saith,
<Q><L>Ferunt vagantes Daemonas</L>
<L>Laetos tenebres noctium</L>
<L>Gallo canente exterritos</L>
<L>Sparsim timere &amp; cedere.</L></Q></P>
<P>3. God in his Holy Word has forbidden
his People to imitate the Heathen Nations.
He requires, that those who profess his Name
should not learn the way of the Heathen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
nor do after their manners, <HI>Lev. 20. 23. Ier.</HI>
10. 2. But to attempt the driving away of
Evil Spirits by the use of Herbs, Fumes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
is an Heathenish Custom. Whoso shall read
<HI>Proclus</HI> his Book <HI>De sacrificio &amp; Magia,</HI> will
see how the <HI>Ethnicks</HI> taught, that Smells and
Smokes would cause <HI>Daemons</HI> to depart. And
the like they believed (and practised accor|dingly)
with respect unto several sorts of
Herbs. See <HI>Sennertus Med. Pract. L. 6. Part.</HI> 9.
<PB N="253" REF="142">
<HI>Cap. 7. Dioscorides</HI> being deceived with the
Doctrine of that great Magician <HI>Pythagoras,</HI>
saith, that the Sea-Onion being hung in the
Porch of an House, will keep Evil Spirits
from entring therein. In that Book which
passeth under the name of <HI>Albertus Magnus
de mirabilibus Mundi,</HI> (though <HI>Picus Miran|dula</HI>
in his Disputation about Magick is so
favourable as to think <HI>Albertus</HI> was not the
Author of it) but that the true Author has
abusively prefixed <HI>Albertus</HI> his Name) There
are many Superstitious Vanities of this na|ture;
which in times of Popish darkness
were received from the <HI>Arabians</HI> and other
Heathenish Worshippers of the Devil. It is
true, that the <HI>Iews</HI> did some of them pra|ctise
this kind of Magick. <HI>Iosephus (Antiq.
Lib. 8. Cap.</HI> 2.) confesseth that those of their
Nation (in special one whose name was <HI>Ele|azar</HI>)
did by holding an Herb (<HI>viz.</HI> that
called <HI>Solomons Seal</HI>) to the Noses of <HI>Daemo|niacks,</HI>
draw the Devils out of them. He
speaketh untruly, in saying, that they learned
such nefarious Arts from <HI>Solomon,</HI> for they
had them from the Heathen, who received
them from the Devil himself; as is evident
from another passage in the mentioned <HI>Io|sephus.</HI>
In his History of the Wars with the
<HI>Iews, Lib. 7. Cap.</HI> 25. He says, that there is a
<PB N="254" REF="143">
Root by the <HI>Iews,</HI> called <HI>Baaras,</HI> which if a
Man pluck it up, he dieth presently; but to
prevent that they make bare the Root, and
then tye it with a string to a Dog, who go|ing
away to follow his Master, easily
plucks up the Root, whereupon the Dog di|eth,
but his Master may then without dan|ger
handle the Root, and thereby fright the
Devils out of persons possessed with Infernal
Spirits: whom he (in that also following the
Heathen) supposes to be the Spirits of wicked
men deceased. And that the <HI>Iews</HI> received
these curious or rather cursed Arts from <HI>Eth|nicks,</HI>
is manifest, inasmuch as <HI>Pliny</HI> taught
that the Herb called <HI>Aglaophotis</HI> had power
to raise the Gods, (so did they call the <HI>Devils</HI>
whom they served.) Now that was the same
Herb with <HI>Baaras;</HI> For as <HI>Delacampius, Rai|nold,</HI>
and others have observed, both name<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
have the same signification. So then the ma|king
use of Herbs to fright away <HI>Devils,</HI> or
to preserve from the power of Witches, is
originally an Heathenish custome, and there|fore
that which ought to be avoided and ab|horred
by those that call themselves Christi|ans.</P>
<P>It is no less Superstitious, when Men En|deavour
by Characters, Words or Spells, to
charm any <HI>Witches, Devils</HI> or <HI>Diseases.</HI> Such
<PB N="255" REF="143">
Persons do (as <HI>Fuller</HI> speaks) fence them
selves with the devils Shield against the devils
Sword, <HI>Agrippa</HI> in his Books <HI>De occulta Phi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">osophia</HI>
has many of these impious curiosities.
But in his Book of <HI>the vanity of Sciences,
Chap.</HI> 48. he acknowledgeth that he wrote his
other Book of <HI>Occult Philosophy,</HI> when he was
a young Man, and bewails his iniquity there|in,
confessing that he had sinfully mispent
precious time in those unprofitable Studies.
There is also an horrid Book full of Conju|rations
and <HI>Magical Incantations,</HI> which the
prophane Author hath ventured to publish
under the name of <HI>King Solomon:</HI> There can|not
be a greater vanity than to imagine that
devils are really frighted with Words and Syl|lables:
such practices are likewise of diaboli|cal
and heathenish original. They that have
read Subjects of this nature, are not ignorant
of what is related concerning the strange
things done by the <HI>Incantations</HI> of that famous
Wizard <HI>Apollonius.</HI> The like has been also
noted of the <HI>Brackmanes</HI> of old, who were
much given to such unlawful Arts. It is still
customary amongst the Heathenish <HI>Africans,</HI>
by <HI>Incantations</HI> to charm Serpents; Which
when they are in that way brought to them
by the devil, they use with the blood of such
Serpents to anoint their Weapons, that so
<PB N="256" REF="144">
they may become the more mortiferous. And
that the like <HI>Incantations</HI> were practised a|mongst
the Gentiles of old is evident from
that verse of <HI>Virgil,</HI> in his 8 <HI>Eclog.</HI>
<Q>Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpiter anguis.</Q>
As also by that of <HI>Ovid</HI> in <HI>Metam.</HI> Lib. 7.</P>
<Q>Viperias rumpi verbis &amp; carmina fauces.</Q>
<P>Yea, the Holy Scriptures intimate, that
such diabolical practices were used by some in
the dayes of old, Those words of <HI>David,
Psal.</HI> 58. 4, 5. imply no less, as our Excellent
<HI>Rainold</HI> has with great Learning and Judge|ment
evinced. It must be acknowledged
that the notion which many have from <HI>Au|stin</HI>
taken up, as if Serpents to avoid the po|wer
of Charms, would lay one Ear to the
ground, and with their tails stop the other
ear, is to be reckoned amongst vulgar errors;
nevertheless, that there were then Charmers
in the World, the mentioned (as well as o|ther)
Scriptures notifie. Moreover, those
Inchanters had their <HI>formulae,</HI> whereby they
did imprecate the persons whom they de|signed
hurt unto; and the <HI>Devil</HI> (when the
Great and Holy God saw meet to permit him)
<PB N="257" REF="144">
would upon the using of those words go to
work, and do strange things. Hence <HI>Livy</HI>
speaks of the <HI>Devotaria Carmina</HI> used by Wi|zards.
The truth of this is also manifest
from some passages in <HI>Aeschines</HI> his Oration
against <HI>Ctesiphon.</HI> And of this nature were
<HI>Balaams Curses,</HI> desired by <HI>Baalak,</HI> as <HI>En|chantments</HI>
against <HI>Iacob,</HI> Numb. 22. 6. &amp;
23. 23. If it had not been a thing famously
known, that <HI>Baalam</HI> (a black Wizard) did
mischief others by his <HI>Incantations,</HI> the King

were frequent among the Gentiles who kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">w
not God; so in a more especial manner
amongst the <HI>Ephesians</HI> before they
were enlightened by the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. Upon their Conversion to the Chri|stian
Faith, as many as had used <HI>curious</HI> (i. e.

<HI>Magical</HI>) Arts, brought their Books toge|ther
and burned them before all men, <HI>Acts</HI>

abound with these Heathenish Superstitions.
They pretended that they could by certain

some of those Charms being obscure &amp;
barbarous words; such as <GAP DESC="foreign">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> These words they would sometimes car|ry
about with them, fairly written; and then
they were a Sacrament for the Devil to ope|rate
by. That insignificant word <HI>Abr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dacara,</HI>
is by <HI>Sammonious</HI> mentioned as a Magical
Spell; which hobgoblin word the late mi|racle
Monger or <HI>Mirabilarian</HI> stroaker, in
<HI>Ireland, Valentin Greatrix</HI> attempted to cure
an Ague by. <HI>Porphyrius</HI> saith, that the <HI>Egyp|tians</HI>
had Symbols, which <HI>Serapis</HI> appointed
them to use in order to the driving away <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|mons.</HI>

learned such things from <HI>Bel-zebub,</HI> so have
the Papists (who are called <HI>Gentiles</HI> in the
Scripture, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11. 2. and well they may be so,

words, without the use of any natural

the East, are usually called) Hence are those
celebrated Verses:

<P>It is too well known, that Popish Coun|tries
do still abound with such Superstitious
Vanities as these mentioned. And as <HI>Voetius</HI>
(in his Dissertation <HI>de Exorcismo</HI>) truly tells
them, the <HI>Exorcizations</HI> of the Papists are as
like those of the Heathen as Milk is like to
Milk, or as one Egg is like to another. I know
that some Popish Authors (who are more in|genious)
write against attempting the cure of
Diseases by Words or Charms. <HI>Fernelius,
Benevenius</HI> and (as I remember) <HI>Valesius</HI>
disapprove of it. But few (if any) of them
are against Conjuring away Evil Spirits, by
Words, and I know not what <HI>Formulae</HI> of
their own, or rather of the Devils inventing.

<PB N="261" REF="146">
whose Consciences tell them they have been
guilty of the same iniquity; God gran that
it may have the same effect on them. It is
a marvelous and an amazing thing, that in
such a place as <HI>New-England,</HI> where the Go|spel
hath shined with great power and glory,
any should be so blind as to make attempts of
t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">s kind; yet some such I know there have
been. A Man in <HI>Boston</HI> gave to one a Sealed
Paper, as an effectual remedy against the
Tooth-ach, wherein were drawn several con|fused
Characters, and these words written,
<HI>IN Nomine Patris Filii, &amp; Spiritus Sancti,
Preserve thy Servant, such an one. (Bodinus</HI> and
others write of a convicted Witch, whose
Name was <HI>Barbary Dore,</HI> that confessed she
had often cured Diseases, by using the like
words unto those mentioned.) Not long
since a Man left with another in this Town,
as a rare secret a Cure for the Ague, which
was this, five Letters, <HI>viz. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">, &amp;c.</HI> were to
be written successively on pieces of Bread and
given to the Patient, on one piece he must
write the word <HI>Kalendant,</HI> and so on another
the next day, and in five dayes (if he did be|lieve)
he should not fail of cure. These con|siderations
have made me the more willing a
little to inlarge upon the Argument in hand.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to handle the next
<PB N="262" REF="147">
Case, it may not be amiss to Answer that
which seems the most considerable Allega|tion
against the Arguments thus far insisted
on. It is then by some objected that <HI>Musick</HI>
driveth away Evil Spirits. For when <HI>David</HI>
took an Harp and played with his hand, the
Evil Spirit departed from <HI>Saul, 1 Sam.</HI> 16. 23.
so that it seems the Devils are driven away
by Sounds, and why not then by Words, or
Fumes, or Herbs?</P>
<P><HI>Ans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 1. It is confessed that Satan does take
great advantage from the ill humors and dis|eases
which are in the Bodies of Men great|ly
to molest their Spirits. Especially it is
true concerning Melancholly, which has
therefore been called <HI>Balneum Diaboli,</HI> the
Devils Bath, wherein he delights to be stir|ring.</P>
<P>2. When Bodily Diseases are removed by
the use of natural means, the matter upon
which the Evil Spirit was wont to operate
being gone, he does no more disturb and dis|quiet
the minds of men as before that he did.
The passive disposition in the Body ceasing,
the active affliction caused by the Devil cea|seth
also. <HI>Rulandus</HI> Writes of possessed per|sons
who were cured by Emetic Medicines,
clearing them of those melancholly humors,
by means whereof the Evil Spirit had some|times
<PB N="263" REF="147">
great advantages over them. This also
<HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">natius</HI> does by many Instances confirm.
<HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rtus</HI> likewise has divers passages to the
same purpose. Also we see by frequent ex|perience,
persons strangely hurried by Satan,
have by the blessing of God upon the endea|vou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of the Physitian been delivered from
those woful molestations. <HI>Ferrarius, Delrio,
Burgensis,</HI> and others, Commenting on 1 <HI>Sam.</HI>
16. conceive that the Ingress and Egress of
Evil S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">irits depends upon the humors and
dispositions of the Body; which Assertion is
not unive sally true: For sometimes the De|vil
hath laughed at the Physitians, who have
thought by Medicinal Applications to dis|possess
him. Examples for this may be seen
in <HI>Fernelius</HI> and <HI>Codronchus.</HI> Wherefore <HI>Voe|tius</HI>
in his Disputation, <HI>de Emergumenis,</HI> Page
1025. speaketh cautiously and judiciously, in
asserting that we may not suppose that the
Devils taking bodily possession of this or that
person, depends wholly upon corporeal dispo|sitions;
nevertheless that natural Distempers
sometimes are an occasion thereof.</P>
<P>3. It is also true that <HI>Musick</HI> is of great effi|cacy
against Melancholly discomposures.
This notwithstanding, there is no reason to
conclude with <HI>Mendozo, Bodin,</HI> and others,
that <HI>Musick</HI> is so hateful to the Devil, as that
<PB N="264" REF="148">
he is necessitated to depart when the pleasant
sound is made. If that were so, how comes
it to pass that appearing <HI>Daemons</HI> do some|times
depart with a melodious sound? or that
in the Conventicles of Witches there is Mu|sick
heard? But <HI>La Torr</HI> has notably con|futed
such Imaginations. Indeed the sweet|ness
and delightfulness of Musick has a na|tural
power to lenifie Melancholly passions.
They say that <HI>Pythagoras</HI> by Musick restored
a Frantick Man to his Wits again. Thus was
<HI>Saul's</HI> pensive Spirit refreshed by <HI>David's</HI> plea|sant
Harp, and when he was refreshed and
well, the Evil Spirit which took advantage of
his former pensiveness, upon his alacrity de|parted
from him. So that it remains still a
truth, that corporeal things have no direct
Physical influence upon Infernal Spirits, and
that therefore for men to think that they
shall drive away <HI>Daemons</HI> by any such means
is folly and Superstition. I shall add no more
in Answer to the first <HI>Quaere</HI> proposed.</P>
<P><HI>A second</HI> Case, <HI>which we shall here take
occasion to enquire into, is,</HI> Whether it be law|ful
for Bewitched Persons to draw blood from
those whom they suspect for Witches, or to put
Urin into a Bottle, or to nail an Horse-shoe at their
Doors, or the like, in hopes of roc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">vering health
thereby?</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="148">
<HI>Ans.</HI> There are several great Authors who
have discovered and declared the evil of all
such practices. In special <HI>Voetius, Sennertus,</HI>
and our <HI>Perkins</HI> disapprove thereof. There
is another Question much what of the same
nature with this, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether a Bewitched
person may lawfully cause any of the Devils
<HI>Symbols</HI> to be removed in order to gaining
Health? As suppose an Image of Wax in
which Needles are fixed, whereby the Devil
doth at the instigation of his Servants, tor|ment
the diseased person whether this being
discovered may be taken away, that so the
Devils power of operation may cease, and
that the sick person may in that way obtain
health again? The Affirmative of this
<HI>Quaestion</HI> is stiffly maintained by <HI>Scotus, Caje|tan,
Delrio, Malderus,</HI> and by Popish Authors
generally. Yet amongst them <HI>Hesselius,
Estius,</HI> and <HI>Sanchez,</HI> hold the Negative. And
so do all our Protestant Writers, so far as I
have had occasion to observe. And although
some make light of such practices, and others
undertake to justifie them, yet it cannot just|ly
be denied but that they are impious follies.</P>
<P>For 1. They that obtain Health in this
way have it from the Devil. The Witch
cannot recover them, but by the Devils help.
Hence as it is unlawful to entreat Witches to
<PB N="266" REF="149">
heal bewitched persons, because they cannot
do this, but by Satan, so is it very sinful by
scratching, or burnings, or detention of urin,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to endeavour to constrain them to un|bewitch
any; for this is to put them upon
seeking to the Devil. The Witch does nei|ther
inflict nor remove the disease, but by
the assistance of the Devil; therefore either
to desire or force thereunto, is to make use
of the Devils help. The person th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s reco|vered
cannot say, <HI>The Lord was my Heal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI>
but <HI>the Devil was my Healer.</HI> Certainly it
were better for a Man to remain sick all his
dayes, yea (as <HI>Chrysostom</HI> speaks) <HI>he had bet|ter
die then go to the Devil for health.</HI></P>
<P>Hence 2. Men and Women have by such
practices as these mentioned, black commerce
and communion with the Devil. They do
(though ignorantly) concern and involve
themselves in that Covenant which the Devil
has made with his devoted and accursed Vas|sals.
For, whereas it is pleaded, that if the
thing bewitched be thrown into the fire, or
the Urin of the sick stopped in a Bottle, or
an Horse-shoe nailed before the door, then
by vertue of the compact which is between
the Devil and his Witches, their power of
doing more hurt ceaseth; they that shall for
such an end so practise, have fellowship with
<PB N="267" REF="149">
that Hellish Covenant. The Excellent <HI>Sen|nertus</HI>
argueth solidly, in saying, <HI>they that force
another to do that which he cannot possibly do, but
by vertue of a compact with the Devil, have
themselves implicitly communion with the Dia|bolical
Covenant.</HI> And so is the case here.
Who was this Art of unbewitching Persons in
such a way first learned of? If due enquiry
be made, it will be found that Magicians and
Devils were the first discoverers. <HI>Porphyrie</HI>
saith, it was by the revelation of the <HI>Daemons</HI>
themselves that Men came to know by what
things they would be restrained from, and
constrained to this or that: <HI>Eujeb. praep. Evan.
L. 5. C.</HI> 7. Dr. <HI>Willet</HI> in <HI>Ex. 7. Quest.</HI> 9. To use
any Ceremonies in vented by Satan, to attain
a supernatural end, implies too great a con|cernment
with him. Yea, such persons do
honour and worship the Devil by hoping in
his Salvation. They use means to obtain
Health which is not natural, nor was ever
appointed by God, but is wholly of the De|vils
Institution; which he is much pleased
with, as being highly honoured thereby. Nay
such practices do imply an invocation of the
Devil for relief, and a pleading with him the
Covenant which he hath made with the
Witch, and a declaration of confidence that
the Father of Lies will be as good as his
<PB N="268" REF="150">
word. For the nefandous Language of such
a practice, is this: <Q>Thou O Devil, hast
made a Covenant with such an one, that
if such a Ceremony be used, thou wilt then
cease to torment a poor creature that is now
afflicted by thee. We have used that Ce|remony,
and therefore now O Satan we
expect that thou shouldest be as good as they
word which thou hast covenanted with
that Servant of thine, and cease torment|ing
the Creature that has been so afflicted
by thee.</Q> Should Men in words speak thus,
What horrid Impiety were it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> therefore to
do actions which import no less, is (whate|ver
deluded Souls think of it) great and hai|nous
Iniquity.</P>
<P>3. Let such practitioners think the best of
themselves, they are too near a Kin to those
creatures who commonly pass under the
name of <HI>white Witches.</HI> They that do hurt
to others by the Devils help, are called <HI>black
Witches:</HI> but there are a sort of persons in
the World, that will never hurt any, but only
by the power of the Infernal Spirits they
will un-bewitch those that seek unto them
for relief: I know that by <HI>Constantius</HI> his
Law, black Witches were to be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nished,
and white ones indulged: But M. <HI>Perkins</HI>
saith, that <HI>the good Witch is a more horrible
<PB N="269" REF="150">
and detestable Monster than the bad one. Ba|laam</HI>
was a black Witch, and <HI>Simon Magus</HI> a
white one. This later did more hurt by his
Cures, than the former by his Curses. How
persons that shall unbewitch others by put|ting
U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">n into a Bottle, or by casting Excre|ments
into the fire, or nailing of Horse-shoes
at Mens doors, can wholly clear themselves
from being white Witches, I am not able to
understand.</P>
<P>4. Innocent persons have been extreamly
wronged by such Diabolical tricks. For
sometimes (as is manifest from the Relation
of the <HI>Groton</HI> Maid, mentioned in the fifth
Chapter of this Essay) the Devil does not
only himself inflict Diseas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s upon Men, but
represent the visages of innocent persons to
the phansies of the diseased, making them
believe that they are tormented by them,
when only himself does it. And in case they
follow the Devils direction, by observing the
Ceremonies which he has invented, hee'l
afflict their Bodies no more. So does his
malice bring the persons accused by him
(though never so innocent) into great su|spicion.
And he will cease afflicting the bo|dy
of one, in case he may ruin the credit of
another, and withal endanger the Souls of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hose that hearken to him. If the Devil
<PB N="270" REF="151">
upon scratchings, or burnings, or stoppings
of Urin, or the nailing of an Horse-shoe,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall cease to afflict the body of any, he
does this either as being compelled thereto, or
voluntarily. To imagine that such things
shall constrain the Evil Spirit to cease afflict|ing,
whether he will or no, is against all rea|son.
But if he does this voluntarily, then in|stead
of hurting their bodies, he does a grea|ter
mischief to Souls. <GAP DESC="foreign">. The
Devil heals the Body that he may wound the
Soul. He will heal them with all his heart,
provided that he may but thereby draw men
to look unto him for help, instead of seeking
unto God alone, in the use of his own means,
and so receive that honour (the thing that he
aspires after) which is the Lords due. How
gladly will that wicked Spirit heal one body
upon condition that he may entangle many
Souls with Superstition. And if Men and
Women (especially in places of light) will
hearken to him, it is a righteous thing with
God to suffer it to be thus. It is past doubt
that Satan, who has the power of death, <HI>Heb.</HI>
2. 14. has also (by divine permission) power
to inflict, and consequently to remove Dis|eases
from the bodies of men. In natural
Diseases he has many times a great operation,
and is willing to have them cured rather by
<PB N="271" REF="151">
the use of Superstious then of natural means.
It is noted in the <HI>Germanic Ephemeris</HI> for the
year 1675. that a Man troubled with a <HI>Fi|stula,</HI>
which the Physitians by all their Art
could no way relieve; a person that was e|steemed
a Wizard undertook to cure him;
and applying a Powder to the wound, with|in
a few dayes the sick party recovered. The
powder was some of the ashes of a certain
Woman who had been burnt to death for a
Witch. This was not altogether so horrid
as that which is by Authors worthy of credit
reported to come to pass, in the days of Pope
<HI>Adrian</HI> VI. when the Plague raging in <HI>Rome,</HI>
a Magician (whose Name was <HI>Demetrius
Spartan)</HI> caused it to be stayed by sacrificing
a Bull to the Devil. See P. <HI>Iovius Histor.
Lib.</HI> 21. Such power hath the righteous God
given unto Satan over the sinful Children of
Men; yea such a Ruler hath he set over
them as a just punishment for all their wick|edness.
His chief design is to improve that
power which by reason of sin he hath ob|tained
to seduce into more sin. And the Ho|ly
God to punish the World for iniquity,
often suffers the Enemy to obtain his de|sires
this way. What strange things have
been done, and how have Diseases been heal|ed
by the sign of the Cross many times? By
<PB N="272" REF="152">
which means Satans design in advancing
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> to the destruction of thousands of
Souls, has too successfully taken place. And
this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> did he early and gradually ad|vance
amongst Christians. I have not been
able without astonishment to read the passa|ges
related by <HI>Austin de civitate Dei Lib. 22.
Cap.</HI> 8. He there speaks of one <HI>Innocentia,</HI>
whom he calls a most Religious Woman, who
having a Cancer in her Breast; the most
skilful Physitians doubted of the cure. But in
her sleep she was admonished to repair unto
the Font where she had been Baptized, and
there to sign that place with the sign of the
Cross, which she did, and was immediately
healed of her Cancer. In the same Chap|ter,
he reports that a Friend of <HI>Hesperius</HI> did
from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> send him some Earth that
was taken out of the place where our Lord
Christ had been buried; &amp; that <HI>Hesperius</HI> had
no sooner received it but his House which
before had been molested with Evil Spirits
was rid of those troublesome guests. He gi|veth
an account also, of strange Cures
wrought by the Reliques of the Martyrs. It
was not (he saith) known where the bo|dies
of <HI>Protasius</HI> and <HI>Gervas</HI> (holy Martyrs)
were buried; but <HI>Ambrose</HI> had it revealed to
him in his sleep; and a blind Man approach|ing
<PB N="273" REF="152">
near unto th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bodies instantly received
his sight. Another was cured of Blindness
by the Reliques of the Martyr <HI>Stephen.</HI> And
a Child playing abroad, a Cart wheel run o|ver
him and bruised him, so that it was
thought he would immediately expire; but
his Mother carrying him into the House that
was built to honour the memory of St. <HI>Ste|phens</HI>
life and health were miraculously con|tinued.
Many other wonderful cures doth
<HI>Austin</HI> there mention, as done by <HI>Stephen</HI>'s
Reliques. But who seeth not that the hand
of <HI>Ioab</HI> was in all these things? For by this
means Satan hath filled the World with Su|perstition.
The Cross is worshipped; The
Reliques of Martyrs are adored; The ho|nour
due to God alone is given to the crea|ture.
The same method has the grand Ene|my
observed, that so he might bring that Su|perstition
of <HI>Iconolatry</HI> or Image Worship,
which is so provoking to the jealous God, in|to
repute amongst Christians. It would be
endless to enumerate how many in Popish
Countries have been cured of Diseases which
for their sins God hath suffered the Devil to
punish them with, by touching the Image of
this or that Saint. Nay, some whose bodies
have been possessed with evil Spirits, have in
that way of Superstition found relief; in a
<PB N="274" REF="153">
more especial manner, when the Image of
the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> hath been presented before
persons Possessed, the Devil in them hath cri|ed
out, and shrieked after a fearful manner, as
if he had been put to horrible torture at the
sight of that Image, and so hath seemed to
depart out of the miserable creature molested
by him; and all this that so deluded Papists
might be hardened in their Superstitious opi|nion
of that Image. Many such devices
hath Satan to ensnare and ruin the Souls of
Men. Some report that the Bodies of Ex|communicates
in the <HI>Greek Churches</HI> at this
day, are strangely handled by the Devil, af|ter
Death hath taken hold of them. M.
<HI>Ricaut</HI> in his Relation of the present state of
the <HI>Greek Churches,</HI> Page 279. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> saith that
a grave <HI>Kaloir</HI> told him that to his own cer|tain
knowledge, a person who fell under
their Church-censure, after he had been for
some time buried, the People where his corps
lay interred, were affrighted with strange Ap|paritions,
which they concluded arose from
the Grave of the accursed Excommunicate,
which thereupon was opened, and they found
the Body uncorrupted, and replete with
Blood, the Coffin furnished with Grapes,
Nuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> brought thither by infernal Spirits.
The <HI>Kaloirs</HI> resolved to use the common re|medy
<PB N="275" REF="153">
in those cases, <HI>viz.</HI> to cut the body in
several parts, and to boyl it in Wine, as the
approved means to dislodge the evil Spirit,
but his Friends intreated rather that the Sen|tence
of Excommunication might be rever|sed,
which was granted. In the mean time
Prayers, and Masses, and Offerings were
presented for the dead, and whilst they were
performing these Services, on a sudden was
heard a rumbling noise in the Coffin of the
dead party. Which being opened, they
found the body consumed and dissolved into
dust, as if it had been Interred seven years.
The hour and minute of this dissolution be|ing
compared with the date of the <HI>Patriarchs</HI>
release when signed at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> was
found exactly to agree with that moment.
If there be truth in this Relation, 'tis a dread|ful
evidence of Satans Reigning amongst a
Superstitious People, who nevertheless call
themselves Christians; and that he does by
such means as these keep them under chains
of darkness still. The Devil hath played
such Reax as these are, not only amongst
Christians but amongst the Gentiles of old.
For <HI>Titus Latinus</HI> was warned in his sleep
that he should declare unto the Senate that
they must reniew that Stage-plays; he neg|lecting
to deliver his Message, was again by

the same <HI>Daemon</HI> spoken unto in his sleep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
and severely reproved for his Omission, and
his Son died. Still persisting in his omission
the <HI>Daemon</HI> again cometh to him, so that he
was surprized with an acute and horrible dis|ease.
Hereupon by counsel of his Friends,
he was carried in his Bed into the Senate, and
as soon as he had declared what he had seen,
his Health was restored, that he returned
home upon his feet: The issue was, Stage-plays
were more in fashion than ever before.
<HI>Augustin de civitate Dei, Lib. 4. Cap.</HI> 26. Learned
men are not ignorant that strange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cures
were effected amongst the Heathen by the
use of <HI>Talismans,</HI> or <HI>Images;</HI> of which inven|tions
<HI>Zoroaster</HI> (the Father of Magicians) is
supposed to be the first Author. It is report|ed
that <HI>Virgil</HI> made a brazen fly, and a gol|den
horse-leach, whereby Flies were hindred
from coming into <HI>Naples,</HI> and the Horse-lea|ches
were all killed in a Ditch. Thus doth
<HI>Beelzebub</HI> draw miserable Men into Super|stition.</P>
<P>And although I am upon a serious Subject,
and my design in writing these things; that is
so I might bear witness against the Supersti|tion,
which some in this land of light have
been found guilty of; and that (if God
shall bless what has been spoken to convince
<PB N="277" REF="154">
men of the error of their way) the like e|vils
may no more be heard of amongst us;
this notwithstanding; it may not be improper
here to recite some facetious passages, which I
have met with in <HI>Hemmingius</HI> his Discourse,
<HI>De superstitione Magica,</HI> since they are to my
present purpose, as discovering what delight
the infernal Spirits take in drawing Men to
make use of Superstitious means for the reco|very
of health unto their bodies. The
Learned Author mentioned, reports, that as
he was instructing his Pupils in the Art of
<HI>Logic,</HI> he had occasion to recite a couple of
Verses consisting of nine Hobgoblin words,
<HI>Fecana, cajeti, daphenes,</HI> &amp;c. adding by way
of Joke, that those Verses would cure a Fea|ver,
if every day a piece of Bread were gi|ven
to the sick person, with one of these
words written upon it. A simple Fellow that
stood by, thought <HI>Hemmingius</HI> had been in
earnest in what he spoke, and not long af|ter
having a Servant that fell sick of a Fea|ver,
he gave him the first day a bit of Bread,
with a Paper wherein <HI>Fecana</HI> was written, and
so on for six dayes until he came to the word
<HI>Gebali;</HI> and then on a sudden his Servant
was well again. Others seeing the efficacy
of the Amulet did the like, and many were
cured of Feavers thereby. In the same Chap|ter,
<PB N="278" REF="155">
<HI>P. 908. Hemingius</HI> writeth of a knavish
Scholar, that a certain Woman repairing to
him for help, who was excedingly troubled
with sore eyes, promising him a good reward
for his cure, the Knave, though he had no
skill, yet for lucre sake, he promised to effect
the cure; and in order thereto taketh a
piece of Paper, and maketh therein Chara|cters,
unto which he never saw the like be|fore,
only then devised them, and writeth in
great Letters these Abominable Words,
<HI>Diabolus eruat tibi oculos, &amp; foramina stercoribus
impleat.</HI> (The Papists say that their Saint
<HI>Francis</HI> caused the Devil to depart out of a
possessed person by using an alike bruitish ex|pression.)
He folded up the Paper in a cloth,
requiring the diseased party to wear it about
her neck, which she did and her disease was
healed. After two years, being desirous to
know what was in the Paper, she caused it to
be opened and read; and being greatly of|fended
and inraged at this Indignity, cast the
Paper away, immediately upon which her
sore eyes returned again. Without doubt
then, the <HI>Devils</HI> design in this cure, was to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
encourage the prophane <HI>Impostor</HI> to endea|vour
the removal of diseases by like Super|stitious
and wicked practices, whereby his own
and the Souls of others unto whom he should
<PB N="279" REF="155">
impart the Mystery, would be endangered.
The like is to be affirmed concerning at|tempts
to heal diseases, by scratching suspe|cted
Witches, or stopping Urin in Bottles,
nailing of Horse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">shoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may be the
time will come, when they that have been
thus foolish, will feel their own Consciences
smiting them for what they have done. Let
them remember the Example of that graci|ous
and famous Gentlewoman, Mrs. <HI>Honey|wood;</HI>
the occasion of whose sorrowful and
doleful desertion, was, in that having a Child
sick, she asked counsel of a Wizard about its
Recovery. Certainly, it is better for persons
to repent of sin the procuring cause of all
affliction, and by the prayer of Faith to be|take
themselves to the Lord Jesus, the great
Physitian both of body and soul, and so to
wait for healing in the use of lawful means,
until God shall see meet to bestow that mer|cy
on them; I say this is better, than to fol|low
such dark methods as those declared a|gainst,
wherein if they have found any suc|cess,
they may fear it is in wrathful judgment
unto them or theirs. Some observe that per|sons
who receive present healing in such un|lawful
wayes, usually come to unhappy ends
at last. Let me then conclude the Answer
unto the case propounded with the words
<PB N="280" REF="156">
which th Angel bid the Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> speak
to <HI>Ahaziah</HI>'s Messengers, 2 <HI>King. 1. 3. Is it be|cause
there is no God in Israel, that you go to Baal|zebub
the God of Ekron?</HI></P>
<P>There is another Case of Conscience which
may here be enquired into, <HI>viz. Whether it
be lawful to bind persons suspected for Witches,
and so cast them into the Water, in order to ma|king
a discovery of their innocency or guiltiness;
so as that if they keep above the Water, they shall
be deemed as confoederate with the Devil, but if
they sink they are to be acquitted from the crime
of Witchcraft.</HI> As for this way of purgation
it cannot be denied but that some learned
men have indulged it. King <HI>IAMES</HI> ap|proveth
of it, in his Discourse of Witch-craft
<HI>B. 3. Chap.</HI> 6. supposing that the water refu|seth
to receive Witches into its Bosom, be|cause
they have perfidiously violated their
Covenant with God, confirmed by Water in
Baptism. <HI>Kornmannus</HI> and <HI>Scribonius</HI> do upon
the same ground justifie this way of tryal.
But a worthy <HI>Casuist</HI> of our own, giveth a
judicious Reply to this supposal, <HI>viz.</HI> that all
Water is not the Water of Baptism, but that
only which is used in the very act of Baptism.
Moreover, according to this notion the <HI>Proba</HI>
would serve only for such persons as have
been Baptized. <HI>Wierus</HI> and <HI>Bodinus</HI> have
<PB N="281" REF="156">
written against this Experiment. So hath
<HI>Hemmingius;</HI> who saith, that it is <HI>both supersti|tious
and ridiculous.</HI> Likewise, that Learned
Physitian <HI>Iohn Heurnius</HI> has published a Trea|tise,
which he calls, <HI>Responsum ad supremam
curiam Hollandiae, nullum esse aequae innatatio|nem
lamiarum indicium.</HI> That Book I have
not seen, but I find it mentioned in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ursius</HI>
his <HI>Athenae Batavae.</HI> Amongst <HI>English</HI> Au|thors,
Dr. <HI>Cott</HI> hath endeavoured to shew the
unlawfulness of using such a practice. Also
Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI> is so far from approving of this
<HI>probation by cold water,</HI> as that he rather in|clines
to think that the persons who put it in
practice are themselves after a sort practisers
of Witch-craft. That most Learned, Judi|cious,
and Holy Man, <HI>Gisbertus Voetius</HI> in his
forementioned Exercitation <HI>de Magia,</HI> P. 573.
endeavours to evince that the custom of try|ing
Witches by casting them into the Wa|ter
is <HI>unlawful, a Tempting of God, and indirect
Magic.</HI> And that it is utterly unlawful, I am
by the following Reasons convinced:</P>
<P>1. This practice has no Foundation in na|ture,
nor in Scripture. If the Water will
bear none but Witches, this must need proceed
either from some natural or some super|natural
cause. No natural cause is or can be
assigned why the bodies of such persons
<PB N="282" REF="157">
should swim rather than of any other. The
Bodies of Witches have not lost their natural
Properties, they have weight in them as well
as others. Moral changes and viceousness
of mind, make no alteration as to these na|tural
proprieties which are inseparable from
the body. Whereas some pretend that the
Bodies of Witches are possessed with the De|vil,
and on that account are uncapable of
sinking under the water; <HI>Malderus</HI> his reply
is rational, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Allegation has no
solidity in it, witness the <HI>Gadarens</HI> Hoggs,
which were no sooner possessed with the De|vil
but they ran into the Water, and there
perished. But if the experiment be superna|tural,
it must either be Divine or Diabolical.
It is not divine; for the Scripture does no
where appoint any such course to be taken to
find out whether persons are in league with
the Devil or no. It remains then that the
experiment is Diabolical. If it be said, that
the Devil has made a compact with Wizards,
that they shall not be drowned, and by that
means that Covenant is discovered; the Re|ply
is, we may not in the least build upon
the Devils word. By this Objection the mat|ter
is ultimately resolved into a Diabolical
Faith. And shall that cast the scale, when
the lives of men are concerned? Suppose
<PB N="283" REF="157">
the Devil saith these persons are Witches,
must the Judge therefore condemn them?</P>
<P>2. Experience hath proved this to be a fal|lacious
way of trying Witches, therefore it
ought not to be practised. Thereby guilty
persons may happen to be acquitted, and the
innocent to be condemned. The Devil may
have power to cause supernatation on the wa|ter
in a person that never made any compact
with him. And many times known and
convicted Wizards have sunk under the wa|ter
when thrown thereon. In the <HI>Bohemian</HI>
History mention is made of several Witches,
who being tried by cold water were as much
subject to submersion as any other persons.
<HI>Delrio</HI> reports the like of another Witch.
And <HI>Godelmannus</HI> speaks of six Witches in
whom this way of trial failed. <HI>Malderus</HI> saith
It has been known that the very same per|sons
being often brought to this probation by
Water, did at one time swim and another
time sink; and this difference has sometimes
hapned according to the different persons
making the experiment upon them; in which
respect one might with greater reason con|clude
that the persons who used the experi|ment
were Witches, then that the persons
tried were so.</P>
<P>3. This way of purgation is to be account|ed
<PB N="284" REF="158">
of, like other provocations or appeals to
the Judgement of God, invented by men:
such as <HI>Camp-fight, Explorations by hot water,
&amp;c.</HI> In former times it hath been customary
(and I suppose tis so still among the <HI>Norwe|gians</HI>)
that the suspected party was to put his
hand into s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">alding water, and if he received
no hurt thereby then was he reputed inno|cent;
but if otherwise, judged as guilty. Al|so,
the trial by <HI>fire Ordeal</HI> has been used in our
Nation in times of Darkness. Thus <HI>Emma</HI>
the Mother of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor,
was led barefoot and blindfold over certain
hot irons, and not hapning to touch any of
them, was judged innocent of the crime
which some suspected her as guilty of. And
<HI>Kunegund</HI> Wife to the Emperour <HI>Henry II.</HI> be|ing
accused of Adultery, to clear her self, did
in a great and honourable Assembly take up
seven glowing irons one after on other with
her bare hand, and had no harm thereby.
These bloody kind of Experiments are now
generally banished out of the World. It is
pity the <HI>Ordeal</HI> by cold water is not exploded
with the other.</P>
<P>4. This <HI>vulgar probation</HI> (as it useth to be
called) was first taken up in times of Su|perstition,
being (as before was hinted of o|ther
Magical Impostures) propagated from
<PB N="285" REF="158">
<HI>Pagans</HI> to <HI>Papists,</HI> who would (as may be ga|thered
from <HI>Bernards</HI> 66 Serm. <HI>in Cantica)</HI>
sometimes bring those that were under suspi|cion
for Heresie unto their Purgation in this
way. We know that our <HI>Ancestors,</HI> the old
<HI>Pagan Saxons</HI> had amongst them four sorts of
<HI>Ordeal (i. e.</HI> Trial or <HI>Iudgement</HI> as the <HI>Saxon</HI>
word signifies) whereby when sufficient
proof was wanting, they sought (according
as the Prince of darkness had instructed
them) to find out the truth concerning su|spected
persons, one of which <HI>Ordeals</HI> was
this, the persons surmised to be guilty, having
Cords tied under their Arms, were thrown
with it into some River, to see whether they
would sink or swim. So that this Probation
was not originally confined to Witches, but
others supposed to be Criminals were thus to
be tried: but in some Countries they thought
meet thus to examine none but those who
have been suspected for familiarity with the
Devil. That this custom was in its first rise
Superstitious is evident from the Ceremonies
of old used about it. For the <HI>Proba</HI> is not ca|nonical,
except the person be cast into the
Water with his right hand tied to his left foot.
Also, by the Principle, which some approvers
of this Experiment alledge to confirm their
fansies; their Principle is, <HI>Nihil quod per
<PB N="286" REF="159">
Necromantian fit, potest in aqua fallere aspectum
intuentium.</HI> Hence <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury,
Lib. 2. P.</HI> 67. tells a fabulous Story (though he
relates it not as such) of a Traveller in <HI>Italy</HI>
that was by a Witch transformed into an
Asse, but retaining his humane understanding
would do such feats of activity, as one that
had no more wit than an Asse could not do;
so that he was sold for a great price; but
breaking his Halter he ran into the Water,
and thence was instantly unbewitched, and
turned into a Man again. This is as true as
<HI>Lucian</HI>'s Relation about his own being by
Witch-craft transformed into an Asse;
and I suppose both are as true as that cold
water will discover who are Witches. It is
to be lamented, that <HI>Protestants</HI> should in
these dayes of light, either practise or plead
for so Superstitious an Invention, since <HI>Pa|pists</HI>
themselves have of later times been a|shamed
of it. <HI>Verstegan</HI> in his Antiquities,
<HI>Lib. 3. P.</HI> 53. speaking of the trials by <HI>Ordeal,</HI>
and of this by cold water in particular, has
these words; <HI>These aforesaid kinds of</HI> Ordeals,
<HI>the</HI> Saxons <HI>long after their Christianity continued:
but seeing they had their beginnings in</HI> Paganism
<HI>and were not thought fit to be continued amongst
Christians; at the last by a Decree of Pope</HI> Ste|phen
<HI>II. they were abolished.</HI> Thus he. Yea,
<PB N="287" REF="159">
this kind of trial by Water, was put down in
<HI>Paris</HI> A. D. 1594. by the supream Court
there. Some learned <HI>Papists</HI> have ingenuous|ly
acknowledged that such <HI>Probations</HI> are Su|perstitious.
It is confessed that they are so,
by <HI>Tyraeus, Binsfeldius, Delrio,</HI> and by <HI>Malde|rus
de magia,</HI> Tract. 10. <HI>Cap. 8. Dub.</HI> 11. who
saith, that they who shall practise this Super|stition,
and pass a judgement of Death upon
any persons on this account, will (without
repentance) be found guilty of Murder be|fore
God.</P>
<P>It was in my thoughts to have handled
some other Cases of the like nature with these
insisted on: but upon further consideration, I
suppose it less needful, the practices which have
given occasion for them being so grosly Su|perstitious,
as that they are ashamed to show
their heads openly. The <HI>Chaldae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ns</HI> and o|ther
Magicians amongst the Heathen Nati|ons
of old, practised a sort of <HI>Divination</HI> by
<HI>Sieves</HI> (which kind of <HI>Magic</HI> is called <HI>Coscino|mantia)</HI>
The like Superstition has been fre|quent
in Popish Countries, where they have
been wont to utter some words of Scripture,
and the Names of certain Saints over a <HI>Sieve,</HI>
that so they might by the motion thereof,
know where something stollen or lost was to
be found. Some also have believed that if
<PB N="288" REF="160">
they should cast Lead into the Water, then
<HI>Saturn</HI> would discover to them the thing they
enquired after. It is not <HI>Saturn</HI> but <HI>Satan</HI>
that maketh the discovery, when any thing
is in such a way revealed. And of this sort
is the foolish Sorcery of those Women that
put the white of an Egg into a Glass of Wa|ter,
that so they may be able to divine of what
Occupation their future Husbands shall be.
It were much better to remain ignorant than
thus to consult with the Devil. These kind
of practices appear at first blush to be Diaboli|cal;
so that I shall not multiply Words in e|vincing
the evil of them. It is noted that
<HI>the Children of Israel did secretly those things
that are not right against the Lord their God,</HI>
2 King. 17. 9. I am told that there are some
who do secretly practise such Abominations
as these last mentioned, unto whom the Lord
in mercy give deep and unfeigned Repen|tance
and pardon for their grievous Sin.</P>

<P>HAving dispatched the <HI>Digression,</HI> which
the things related in some of the pre|ceding
Chapters did necessarily lead us into:
I now proceed in commemorating some o|ther
<HI>Remarkables,</HI> which it is pity but that Po|sterity
should have the knowledge of. I shall
in this Chapter only take notice of two par|ticulars
amongst our selves, with some parallel
Instances which have hapned in other parts
of the World. I am informed that there is
now at <HI>Weymouth</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> a Man and
his Wife who are both of them Deaf, and
<PB N="290" REF="161">
that the Woman had been so from her In|fancy;
and yet that she understands as much
concerning the state of the Country, and
of particular persons therein, and of obser|vable
occurrences, as almost any one of her
Sex; and (which is more wonderful) though
she is not able to speak a word, she has by
sings made it appear that she is not ignorant
of <HI>Adam</HI>'s fall, nor of Man's misery by na|ture,
nor of Redemption by Christ, and the
great concernments of Eternity, and of ano|ther
World, and that she her self has had ex|perience
of a work of Conversion in her
own Soul. I have made enquiry about this
matter of some that are fully acquainted
therewith, and have from a good hand re|ceived
this following account. <Q><HI>Matthew
Prat</HI> aged about fifty five years, was in his
minority by his godly Parents educated re|ligiously,
and taught to read: When he
was about twelve years old, he became to|tally
Deaf by sickness, and so hath ever
since continued; after the loss of his hear|ing
he was taught to write: his Reading
and Writing he retaineth perfectly, &amp; makes
much good improvement of both, but his
Speech is very broken, and imperfect, not
easily intelligible; he maketh use of it more
seldom, only to some few that are wonted
<PB N="291" REF="161">
to it. He discourseth most by Signs, and
by Writing. He is studious and judicious
in matters of Religion, hath been in Church|fellowship,
a partaker of all Ordinances
near thirty years, hath approved himself un|to
good satisfaction therein, in all wayes of
Church Communion, both in publick and
private; and judged to be a well wrought
Convert and real Christian. <HI>Sarah Prat</HI>
his Wife, being about forty three years old,
was also quite deprived of Hearing by sick|ness,
when about the third year of her Age,
after she could speak, and had begun to learn
Letters, having quite lost Hearing, she lost
all speech (doubtless all remembrance and
understanding of Words and Language,)
her Religious Parents being both dead, her
godly Brother <HI>Ephraim Hunt</HI> (yet surviving)
took a Fatherly care of her, she also happi|ly
fell under the Guardianship and Tuition
of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thomas Thacher,</HI> who
laboured with design to teach her to under|stand
Speech or Language by Writing, but
it was never observed that any thing was
really effected; she hath a notable accuracy
and quickness of understanding by the Eye,
she discourseth altogether by signs, they that
are able to discourse with her in that way,
will communicate any matter much more
<PB N="292" REF="162">
speedily (and as full) as can be by Speech,
and she to them. Her Children sign from
the Breast, and learn to speak by their eyes
and fingers sooner than by their tongues.
She was from her Child-hood naturally so|ber,
and susceptible of good civil Education,
but had no knowledge of a Deity, or of
any thing that doth concern another life
and world. Yet God hath of his infinite
mercy, revealed Himself, his Son, and the
great Mysteries of Salvation unto her by an
Extraordinary and more immoderate work|ing
of his Spirit (as tis believed) in a sa|ving
work of Conversion. An account of
her Experiences was taken from her in wri|ting
by her Husband; upon which she was
Examined by the Elders of the Church,
they improving her Husband and two of
her Sisters, intelligent persons, and notably
skill'd in her artificial Language; by whose
help they attained good satisfaction, that she
understandeth all the Principles of Religion:
Those of the Unity of the Divine Essence,
Trinity of Persons, the Personal Union,
the Mystical Union, they made most dili|gent
enquiry about, and were satisfied that
her Knowledge and Experience was di|stinct
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, and they hoped saving.
She was under great exercise of Spirit, and
<PB N="293" REF="162">
most affectionately concerned for and about
her Soul, her Spiritual and Eternal estate.
She imparted her self to her Friends, and
expressed her desire of help. She made use
of the Bible and other good Books, and re|markt
such places and passages as suited her
condition, and that with tears; she did
once in her Exercise, write with a Pin up|on
a Trencher three times over, <HI>Ah poor
S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ul!</HI> and therewithal burst forth into tears,
before divers of her Friends. She hath
been wont to enquire after the Text, and
when it hath been shewed to her to look
and muse upon it. She knoweth most, if
not all persons Names that she hath ac|quaintance
with. If Scripture Names, will
readily turn and point to them in the Bible.
It may be conceived, that although she
understands neither Words, Letters,
nor Language; yet she understands things
Hieroglyphically. The Letters and Words
are unto her but signs of the things, and as
it were Hieroglyphicks. She was very de|sirous
of Church-Communion in all Ordi|nances,
and was admitted with general and
good satisfaction, and hath approved her
self to the best observation, a grave and
gracious Woman. They both attend pub|lick
Worship with much reverence and con|stancy,
<PB N="294" REF="163">
and are very inoffensive (and in di|vers
respects) exemplary in their Conver|sation.</Q>
Thus far is that Narrative, written
<HI>Iune</HI> 27. 1683.</P>
<P>I suppose no one that rightly consider the
Circumstances of this Relation will make a
scruple about the lawfulness of admitting such
Persons to participate in the Holy Mysteries
of Christ's Kingdom. All judicious <HI>Casuists</HI>
determine, that those who were either born,
or by any accident made Deaf and Dumb,
if their Conversation be blameless, and they
able by signs (which are Analogous to ver|bal
expressions) to declare their knowledge
and faith; may as freely be received to the
Lords Supper, as any that shall orally make the
like Profession. Of this judgement was <HI>Lu|ther.</HI>

does confirm this by producing several In|stances
of Dump<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> persons admitted to the
Communion. Its certain that some such
have been made to understand the Mysteries
of the Gospel, so as to suffer Martyrdome on
that account.</P>
<P>In the Year 1620, one that was Deaf and
<PB N="295" REF="163">
Dumb, being solicited by the <HI>Papists</HI> to be
present at <HI>Masse,</HI> chose rather to suffer death.
It is also a thing known, that Men are able
by signs to discourse, and to communicate
their sentiments one to another. There are
above thirty <HI>Mutes</HI> kept in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court
for the Grand Seignior to sport with: Con|cerning
whom Mr. <HI>Ricaut</HI> in his History of
the present State of the <HI>Ottoman Empire (P.</HI>
62.) reports, that they are able by signs not
only to signifie their sence in familiar Que|stions,
but to recount Stories, and understand
the Fables of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Religion, the Laws
and Precepts of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> the name of
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> and what else may be capable of
being expressed by the tongue. This Lan|guage
of the <HI>Mutes</HI> is so much in fashion in
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, that almost every one
can deliver his sense in it. And that Deaf
persons have been sometimes able to write,
and to understand what others say to them by
the very motion of their Lips is most certain.
<HI>Camerarius</HI> tells us of a young Man and a
Maid then living at <HI>Noremberg,</HI> who though
Deaf and Dumb, could Read and Write, and
Cypher, and by the motion of a mans Lips,
knew his meaning. <HI>Platerus</HI> speaketh of one
Deaf and Dumb born, that yet could express
his mind in a Table-book, and understood
<PB N="296" REF="164">
what others wrote therein, and was wont to
attend upon the Ministry of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">colampadius,</HI>
understanding many things by the motion of
the lips of the Preacher. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in his
Examples <HI>(Vol. 1. Chap.</HI> 33.) saith, that there
was a Woman in <HI>Edinburg</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> (her
Name was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">nnet Lowes)</HI> who being natu|rally
Deaf and Dumb, could understand
what People said meerly by the moving of
their Lips. It is famously known that Mr.
<HI>Crisp</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> could do the like. <HI>Borellus</HI>
giveth an account of one that lost his Hear|ing
by a violent Disease when he was five
years old, yet if they did but whisper to him,
he could by their Lips perceive what they
said. There is one now living (or that not
many years since was so) in <HI>Silesia</HI> in whom
that Disease of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> caused a total
Deafness; who nevertheless, by exact obser|ving
the motion of Mens Lips, can under|stand
what they say; and if they do but
Whisper he perceives what they say better
than if they vociferate never so loudly. He
attends upon publick Sermons, being able to
give an account of what is delivered, pro|vided
he may but see the Preacher speaking,
though he cannot hear a word. It is consistent
with reason that <HI>Mutes</HI> should understand
what others say by the motion of their Lips,
<PB N="297" REF="164">
since it is evident that the lips are of great
use in framing Speech. Hence <HI>Iob</HI> calls his
speech, <HI>the moving of his lips,</HI> Chap. 16. <HI>Ver.</HI> 5,
and we know that tongueless persons by the
help of their lips and other Organs of speech
have been able to speak. Ecclesiastical story
informs us of several Confessors of the truth,
who after their Tongues were cut out by
bloody Persecutors could still bear witness to
the truth. <HI>Honorichius</HI> (that cruel King of
the <HI>Vandals)</HI> caused the Tongues of many
to be violently pluckt out of their mouths;
Who after that could speak as formerly:
Only two of them when they became guilty
of the sin of Uncleanness were able to speak
no more; this has been attested by three cre|dible
Witnesses who knew the persons: See
Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s <HI>Church History,</HI> P. 130. There
is lately Published (in <HI>Latin</HI>) a very strange
Relation of a Child in <HI>France</HI> (his Name
was <HI>Peter Durand</HI>) who being visited with
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> when he was about six years
old, his Tongue putrified, and was quite con|sumed.
After which (the <HI>Uvula</HI> in his Mouth
being longer than it was before) he could
by the help of the other Organs of Speech
discourse as plainly as if he had never lost
his Tongue. These things are marveilous.
And yet I have lately met with a passage
<PB N="298" REF="165">
more strange than any of these related.
There is (or was in the Year 1679.) living
near <HI>Kerchem</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> a Man (his name
is <HI>Iohn Algair)</HI> who suddenly lost the use of
his Speech: the case has been so with him,
that fourteen years together, he can never
speak but at one hour of the Day, just as the
Sun cometh to the Meridian he has the li|berty
of his Speech for an hour and no more;
so that he knoweth exactly when it is twelve
a Clock, because then he can speak, and not
a minute before that, nor a minute after one.
This is related in the <HI>Germanic Ephemerides</HI> of
<HI>Miscellaneous Curiosities,</HI> for the Year 1679.
<HI>Observat.</HI> 188. It is evident that the Sun has
a marvelous influence as to some Diseases,
which the bodies of Men are subject unto.
For in <HI>Egypt</HI> though the Plague rage the day
before, on that very day when the Sun enters
into <HI>Leo,</HI> it ceaseth, when also the Floods of
<HI>Nilus</HI> abate, as Geographers inform us.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is possible by Art to teach
those that are by nature Deaf and Dumb to
speak. The <HI>Dectylogy</HI> of <HI>Beda</HI> is pretty,
whereby Men speak as nimbly with the fin|gers
as with the tongue; taking five fingers
of the one hand for Vowels, and the several
positions of the other for Consonants. But
that Deaf persons may learn to speak, happy
<PB N="299" REF="165">
experience hath proved, and that by many
Instances. A <HI>Castro</HI> has given an account
of the method by him successfully observed
in teaching a Boy to speak that was born
Deaf. After the use of some purgative me|dicines,
he caused the Hair to be shaved off
from his head, over the <HI>Coronal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uture;</HI> and
then frequently anointed the shaven place
with a mixture of <HI>Aqua vitae, Salt peter, Oyl
of Butter, Almonds,</HI> &amp;c. Having done this,
he began to speak to the deaf person (not
at his Ear, but) at his <HI>Coronal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uture;</HI> and
there after the use of Unctions and Emun|ctions
the sound would pierce, when at his
Ears it could not enter, so did he by degrees
teach him to speak <HI>(vide Ephem. German.
Anno 1670. Observat.</HI> 35.) But others have
with good effect, followed another kind of
method. There was a <HI>Spanish</HI> Noble Man
(Brother to the Constable of <HI>Castile</HI>) who
being born Deaf and consequently Dumb
from his Infancy, Physitians had long in vain
tried Experiments for his Relief. At last a
certain Priest undertook to teach him to speak.
His attempt was at first laughed at, but with|in
a while the Gentleman was able (not|withstanding
his Deafness still remained)
to converse and discourse with any Friend.
he was taught to speak by putting a cord about
<PB N="300" REF="166">
his Neck, and straitning or losening the
same, to advertise him when to open or shut
his Mouth, by the Example of his Teacher.
Nor was there any difference found between
his Speech and that of other Men, only that
he did not regulate his voice, speaking com|monly
too high <HI>(vid.</HI> Conferences of <HI>Virtu|osi
P.</HI> 215.) Not long since <HI>Fran. Mercur.
Helmont,</HI> designing to teach a Deaf man to
speak, concluded it would be more easily pra|cticable
if the experiment were made with an
Eastern wide-mouthed Language, which does
remarkably expose to the Eye the motions of
the Lips, Tongue and Throat. According|ly
he tried with the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue; &amp; in a
short time his Dumb Schollar became an ex|cellent
<HI>Hebrician.</HI> Others have lately been
as successful in their attempts to cause Deaf
persons to speak and understand the <HI>Europaean</HI>
Languages. We need not go out of our own
Nation, for there we find living Instances.
In the Philosophical Transactions for the
Year 1670. <HI>Numb.</HI> 61. an account is given
concerning Mr. <HI>Daniel Whaley</HI> of <HI>North-Ham|pton</HI>
in <HI>England;</HI> who by an accident lost his
Hearing when he was about five years of
age; and so his Speech, not at once, but by
degrees in about half a years time. In the
Year 1661. The Learned and Ingenious Dr.
<PB N="301" REF="166">
<HI>Wallis</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> undertook to teach the Deaf
Gentleman to speak and write. Nor did the
Doctor fail in attaining his end. For in the
space of one year, the Dumb man had read
over great part of the <HI>English</HI> Bible, and had
attained so much skill as to express himself
intelligibly in ordinary affairs, to understand
Letters written to him, and to write Answers
to them. And when Forreigners out of cu|riosity
came to visit him, he was able to pro|nounce
the most difficult words of their Lan|guage
(even <HI>polish</HI> it self) which any could
propose unto him. Nor was this the only
person on whom the Doctor shewed his skill,
but he has since done the like for another
(a Gentleman of a very good Family) who
did from his Birth want his Hearing. Like|wise
Dr. <HI>Holder</HI> in his late Book about the na|tural
production of Letters, giveth Rules for
the teaching of the Deaf and Dumb to speak.</P>
<P>I have the rather mentioned these things;
for that there are several others in this Coun|trey
who are Deaf and Dumb; whenas if
they had an ingenious Instructor; I am abun|dantly
satisfied that they might be taught to
speak, their Deafness notwithstanding. Nor
is this more difficult than it is to learn those
that are blind to write; which though some
may think it impossible and incredible, there
<PB N="302" REF="167">
is (or at least three years ago there was) a li|ving
Instance to convince them. For in the
<HI>Weekly Memorials for the Ingenious,</HI> lately pub|lished
at <HI>London</HI> (in <HI>Page</HI> 80.) I find an obser|vable
passage which I shall here cause to be
transc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ibed and inserted. From the Journal

Afterwards they made for her a

either foul her Paper, or by failing, might
cause her to leave words imperfect. 'Tis
after this manner that she writes often in
<HI>Latin</HI> to her Friends, as well as in the other
two Languages.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>But thus much may suffice to be spoken a|bout
<HI>Mutes,</HI> and the possibility of their being
taught intelligibly to express themselves,
though their deafness should still remain. I
now proceed unto things of another nature:
And the next <HI>Remarkable</HI> which we shall take
notice of, is, concerning one now in <HI>Hull</HI> in
<HI>New-England (viz.</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Collier)</HI> who
about sixteen years ago, being sensible of pain
in his throat, made use of the common Re|medies
in that case, but to little effect. At
last the pain about those parts became very
extream, especially when he drank any Beer,
nor was he able to swallow without much
<PB N="304" REF="168">
difficulty, so that he lived upon Water and
liquid Substances. After he had been for
some time in this misery, a Stone appeared
under his Tongue, which though visible to
the Eye, continued there for some dayes be|fore
it was taken out; and at last of it self
fell into his mouth, (and so into his hands)
leaving an hose behind it at the Roof of his
Tongue. This Stone I have by me, whilest
I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ite this, only some part of it is broken
away; that which remains, weighs twelve
Grains. The person concerned, affirms, that
it was first of a yellowish Colour, but now it
is white, not being an inch in length, in
shape somewhat resembling a Mans Tongue.
But that which made the matter the more
strange, was, that when he had occasion to
void Urin, he was in as much pain as if the
Stone had been in his Bladder or Kidney;
for when his Urin passed from him, he was
usually put into a Sweat with pain and anguish;
the reason whereof I shall leave unto the
more curious Inquisitors into Nature to de|termine.
There are <HI>Lapideous Humors</HI> in the
Bodies of men, occasioned sometimes by
Colds, sometimes by ill Diet which are apt to
become Stones. It is related by the late
<HI>German Curiesi,</HI> that in the year 1655. a Per|son
of quality in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Dantzick</HI> was much affli|cted
<PB N="305" REF="168">
with a painful Tumor in his Tongue, a
skilful Chirurgeon perceiving a Stone there,
cut it out, upon which the Patient recovered,
the Stone being as big as a small <HI>Olive.</HI> The
like hapned to another in the Year 1662.
Again in the Year 1678. a Gentlewoman in
<HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nberg,</HI> having been for several Years in the
Spring and in the Fall aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">icted with a pain in
her tongue, at last the pain became intol|lerable,
untill a Stone as big as a a <HI>Filberd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
Nut came out of her Tongue, upon which
she had ease. In the <HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI>
for the Year 1672. <HI>Page</HI> 4062. an account is
given of a Man in <HI>England</HI> who had a Stone
breeding under his Tongue, occasioned by
his suffering much cold in a Winter Sea-Voy|age.
Not long after his Landing, he found
an hard lump in the place where the Stone
was generated. There were eight years be|tween
the time of the Stones first breeding
and its being taken away. Upon a fresh
cold-taking he suffered much pain, but when
his cold was over his pain ceased. At last it
caused a swelling about his throat, especially
at the first draught of Beer at Meals. The
last Summer of his af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">iction, the Stone cau|sed
him to be vertiginous; and some dayes
before its excision, such an abundance of
Rheume and Spittle f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">owed out of his
<PB N="306" REF="169">
his Mouth, as would presently wet all the Bed
about him. The Stone weiged but seven
Grains, being much of the shape of our or|dinary
Horse-beans. This Stone was by ju|dicious
Observators judged to be one of those
Tumors called <HI>Atheroma,</HI> and therefore the
Name they would have it called by, is <HI>Lapis
Atheromatis.</HI> Stones have been taken out of
the Jovnts of many Gouty persons, some cold
Imposthume arising in their joynts before.
<HI>Senner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us, Flat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rus, Barth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">linus, Skenckius,</HI> and
other learned Men have observed that Hu|mane
Bodies are subject to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">trification in
every part of them, and many notable Instan|ces
to this purpose are mentioned in the Phi|losophical
Transactions at <HI>London;</HI> and by
the <HI>Curiesi</HI> in forreign Countries. I presume
it will not be unacceptable unto such as have
not those Books, for me to relate some Ex|amples
out of them to our present purpose.
There was then, a Man who being troubled
with a <HI>Catarrh</HI> and obstruction of Urin,
when a Vein was opened there came four
Stones out of it. Again a person that was
much afflicted with a Distillation of Rhume.
And another that was continually imployed
in preparing Lime. Small stones bred in their
Lungs, many of which (as big as Peas) were
Coughed up. A Stone as big as a Gooses
<PB N="307" REF="169">
Egg was found adhaering to the Liver of the
Countess of <HI>Nadasti.</HI> One that died by a
violent pain in his head, there was found a
Stone therein between the <HI>Dura</HI> and the <HI>Pia
Mater.</HI> A Woman that died by <HI>Nephretick
Pains,</HI> the Physitian found her left Kidney
to be filled with large Stones, as for the right
Kidney the substance of it was converted
into a perfect Stone. In the same year there
was an Ox near <HI>Padua,</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> which could
by no means be made fat; but was observed
to be strangely stupid, and to hold down his
head after an unusual manner; they that
killed him, found that his Brains were petri|fied,
being as hard as Marble. The like hap|ned
to another Ox in <HI>Suecia.</HI> Nor are Hu|mane
Bodies wholly free from the like <HI>Petri|fication;</HI>
for <HI>Anatomists</HI> of good credit, affirm
that they have known several dissected by
them, whose Brains were in part petrified.
Nay the heart it self is not exempted from
this Misery. There were three Stones found
in the Heart of the Emperour <HI>Maximilian II.</HI>
It is no less strange that Bones should be ge|nerated
in the Lungs, Heart, and other Bo|wels.
Nothing in nature seems more myste|rious
than that which hapned to the Brother
of the illustrious <HI>Caspar Horwath,</HI> a Baron in
the Kingdom of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> who having been

but for the six last years of her life,
she perceived it not to move; falling sick she

<HI>petrified.</HI> All the inward parts of the Child
were discoloured with a blackishness, except
the heart, which was red, and without any
issuing blood. This Infant weighed eight
pound Averdupoise. The Mother died, <HI>Iune</HI>
18. 1678. being about the sixty fourth year
of her Age. I should hardly give credit to
a Story so stupendous and incredible, were it
not mentioned in the Philosophical transacti|ons
<HI>(No. 139. P.</HI> 979. as a thing most un|doubtedly
true. But to conclude the Discourse
we are upon, I shall only add here, that it is
not so strange for Stones to breed in all parts
of the Bodies of Men, as for Plants, and di|verse
sorts of Animals to be formed therein:
Yet many Authors have attested to this. And
a late Writer affirms that there was not long
<PB N="310" REF="171">
since a Woman who having drunk <HI>Stagnating</HI>
Water out of a Pond where Frogs used to
keep, grew <HI>Cachectical,</HI> and swelled so as that
she was thought to be <HI>Hydropical.</HI> One Evening
walking near the Ponds where the Frogs cro|ked,
she perceived Frogs to croke in her Bel|ly.
Acquainting a Physitian, he gave her a
strong <HI>Cathartick,</HI> whereupon she cast up two
living Frogs pretty large, green on their back
and yellow under their bellies, and voided
three dead by siege, with a great deal of
greenish <HI>Serum,</HI> after which she was well
disposed. Again in the Year 1680. A Man
living near <HI>Lyons</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> voided a Worm
seven Ells long, scaly like a Serpent, and hairy.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OTher <HI>Remarkables</HI> besides those already
mentioned, have hapned in this Coun|trey,
many of which I cannot here insert, as
not having received a full and clear account
concerning them. Nevertheless, such parti|culars
as I have by good and credible hands
been informed of, I shall further add. And
let it be here Recorded, that we have seen
diverse Tempests in <HI>New-England,</HI> which de|serve
to have a <HI>Remark</HI> set upon them, in re|spect
of some notable Circumstances where|with
they have been attended. I have not
<PB N="312" REF="172">
heard of any Storm more dismal than the
great <HI>Hurricane</HI> which was in <HI>August</HI> 1635.
the fury whereof threw down (either break|ing
them off by the bole or plucking them
up by the roots) thousands of great Trees in
the Woods. Of this some account is given
by Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> in the first Chapter of our
present Collection. And I must confess, I
have peculiar reason to commemorate that
solemn providence, inasmuch as my Father
and Mothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, and four of my Brethren were
then in a Vessel upon the Coast of <HI>New-En|gland,</HI>
being at Anchor amongst the Rocks
at the <HI>Isles of Sholes</HI> when the Storm began;
but their Cables broke, and the Ship was dri|ving
directly upon a mighty Rock, so that all
their lives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> given up for lost, but then in
an instant of time, God turned the Wind a|bout,
which carried them from the Rock of
Death before their eyes: This memorable
providence is mentioned in my Fathers Life,
both in that Edition published in this Coun|trey,
<HI>Page</HI> 21, 22. And also in that publish|ed
by Mr. <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rk</HI> in his last Volumn of Lives,
<HI>Page</HI> 131. Wherefore I shall not here fur|ther
enlarge upon it. In the Year 1659.
near the Town of <HI>Concord</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI>
there hapned that which is somewhat rare,
and therefore to be reckoned amongst Re|markable
<PB N="313" REF="172">
Accidents. In the Moneth of <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI>
it having rained a great part of the
day, at night it froze extreamly, so as that ma|ny
Limbs were broken off from many Trees
by the weight of the Ice, caused by the sud|den
friezing of the Rain upon the Boughs.
It was somewhat formidable to hear the
crackings ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e a good part of the night, by
the falling of so much Wood (thousands of
Cords) as was by that means occasioned.
Of later years several places in this Countrey
have been visited with strange and awful
Tempests. That was very Remarkable
which hapned in <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England,
Iuly</HI> 8. 1680. The persons who were Wit|nesses
of that very amazing Providence
have declared what themselves observed about
it. The History whereof I shall here insert,
a Worthy Person having furnished me with
the following Narrative. <Q><HI>Samuel Stone</HI> of
<HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> does declare and
testifie, that <HI>Iuly</HI> 8. 1680. about two of
clock in the afternoon, he being with his
young Son in the Field, the Wind then
Southerly, he observed a Cloud in the North-west
in opposition to the Wind, which cau|sed
a singing noise in the Air, and the wind
increased, till the Whirl-wind came, which
began in the Mead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> near where he was,<PB N="314" REF="173">
though then it was not so violent as it pro|ved
afterwards, as it passed by him it sucked
up and whirled about the Hay that was
within the compass of it: it passed from
him towards his House over an Hill, tear|ing
down several Trees as it went along;
and coming to his Barn car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ied off a consi|derable
part of the Roof (about twenty
four foot one way, and thirty the other,
fell near the Dwelling-house where People
were, yet could not its fall be heard by them
(yet it was so great that it was heard by some
a mile off) by reason of the great rushing
noise of the Wind. Afterwards as it pres|sed
towards <HI>Matthew Bridge</HI>'s House, it tore
down some Trees and Indian Corn, and
there rose up into the Air for the space of a
quarter of a Mile; afterwards it came down
upon the Earth in a more violent manner;
the effects whereof he saw not, but it may
be known by the following Relation.</Q></P>
<Q><P><HI>Matthew Bridge</HI> who was an Eye-witness
of what hapned, Declares that he observed
a thick Cloud coming along his Fathers
Field before his house, as to appearance ve|ry
black; in the inside of the Cloud as it
passed over him, there seemed to be a light
Pillar as he judged about eight or ten Foot
diameter, which seemed to him like a Screw
<PB N="315" REF="173">
or solid Body. Its motion was continually
circular, which turned about the rest of the
Cloud. It passed along upon the Ground,
tearing all before it, Bushes by the roots, yea
the Earth it self, removing old Trees as they
lay along on the Earth, and Stones of a
great magnitude, some of which could not
be found again: great Trees were twisted
and torn down, and carried a distance from
the place where they were; Branches of
Trees, containing about a Load of Wood,
were blown from their Bodies&punc; and carried
forty yards or more. The Cloud it self
was filled with Stones, Bushes, Boughs, and
other things that it had taken up from the
Earth, so that the top and sides of the Cloud
seemed like a green Wood. After it went
from him, it went a mile and half before it
scattered, bearing down the Trees before it
above a Mile in breadth; passing through
a thick Swamp of <HI>Spruse, Pine,</HI> and other
young Trees (which was about half a mile
through) it laid all flat to the ground, yet
the Trees being young, are since risen up:
it was observable as it passed through a new
planted Orchard, it not only pulled up
some of the young Trees by the roots, but
broke off some of them in the bodies, about
two or three foot high&punc; as if they had been
<PB N="316" REF="174">
shot off not hurting the Stocks. Moreover,
there was such a great noise made by the
Storm, that other considerable noises at the
same time, as falling of very great Trees ve|ry
near one, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> not be heard. The a|bove
said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">, and a Boy with him
endeavoured to run to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">, but were
prevented by the Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m, so that they were
necessitated to ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> upon the Ground be|hind
some Bushes, and this thick Cloud and
Pillar passed so near them as almost to touch
their feet, and with its force bent the Bushes
down over them, and yet their lives were
preserved. <HI>Iohn Robbins</HI> a Servant Man
was suddenly slain by this Storm, his Body
being much bruised, and many Bones bro|ken
by the violence thereof. Thus con|cerning
that.</P></Q>
<P>The last year was attended with sundry
Remarkable Tempests in several parts of this
Countrey. One of which hapned in <HI>New-Haven</HI>
Colony, <HI>Iune</HI> 10. 1682. Concerning
which I have received from a good hand the
following account. This Storm began a|bout
2 <HI>h. P. M.</HI> and continued two hours.
It reached <HI>Stratford, Milford, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">airfield, New-Haven,</HI>
and it was very violent in every
one of these places, especially <HI>Milford,</HI> where
three Barns were blown down by it, and one
<PB N="317" REF="174">
House new built, that was forty foot in
length, well inclosed, was moved from the
Foundation at one corner, near two foot and
an half; but the greatest strength of the
Storm was about six miles above <HI>Stratford,</HI> as
is evident by the great Havock, that is there
made, for the compass of half a mile in
breadth, scarce a Tree left standing, which is
not shaken by the Storm; the strongest
Oaks are torn up by the roots, some two foot,
some three foot and more over; young Sap|lins
that were not so big as a Mans middle,
were broken off in the midst: This Storm
came out of the West, and the Wind did be|fore
the end somewhat vere towards the
North; it was attended with a violent Rain:
the very noise of the Wind in the Woods,
was such, as that those that were in it could
not hear the fall of a Tree a few Rods from
them. Great Limbs of Trees were carried
like Feathers in the Air an incredible di|stance
from the Trees they were broken from:
Many that were at work in the Woods were
in great danger, and had no way to preserve
themselves but by running into open Plains,
where there were no Trees. The strength
of the Storm passed along East and by South,
over <HI>Stratford River,</HI> and between <HI>Milford</HI>
and <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and there it passed away
<PB N="318" REF="175">
into the Sound towards <HI>Long-Island:</HI> Many
thousands of Trees were blown down both a|bove
and below the place before specified, but
in the compass of that half mile, the great|est
strength of the Storm was; for here al|most
there was an universal Destruction of
all the Trees, leaving the place upon Hills so
naked that very few Trees are found standing.
Thus of that Tempest.</P>
<P>Also, on <HI>Iune</HI> 26. 1682. there were the
most amazing Lightnings that have been
known in <HI>New-England,</HI> a great part of the
night being thereby made as light as the Day.
In some places grievous Hail fell with the
Lightning, breaking the Windows of some
Houses. But at <HI>Springfield</HI> it was most dread|ful,
where great pieces of Ice, som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> seven,
some nine inches about, fell down from the
Clouds with such violence that the Shingles
upon some Houses were broken thereby, and
holes beat into the Ground, that a man might
put his hand in. Several acres of Corn (both
Wheat and Indian) were beat down and
destroyed by the Hail. Yet this Hail-storm
(though terrible) was not comparable to that
which hapned three years ago in another
part of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> at the Town of
<HI>Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">is</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where the People were by the
amazing fury of a prodigious Tempest af|frighted
<PB N="319" REF="175">
out of their sleep, and forced to rise
out of their Beds that they might save their
lives. Several Houses, and two (Churches)
Meeting-houses, were beat down to the
ground. This Tempest was likewise ac|companied
with a most prodigious Hail, ma|ny
thousand stones being found as big as a
Mans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ist. This unusual Artillery of Hea|ven,
broke all the Slates wherewith the Hou|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es
were covered, and the Glass-windows, all
over the Town, as if they had been beaten
in a Morter. Without the Town eight whole
Parishes with the Fields adjacent were wholly
ruined by that Hail, in such a terrible man|ner,
that it seemed as if no Corn had been
sown, or Vines planted there. Four other
Parishes were much endamaged, multitudes
of Chimneys beaten down, so that the da|mage
thereby, with the breaking of the Win|dows
and Tyles, were valued to be above
two hundred thousand Crowns; and the
harm in the Vineyards, and Corn-fields in|valuable.
The Divine Providence was very
much seen, in that Man, Woman nor Child
were killed in this fearful Desolation. The
Reader may see a more full Relation of this
prodigious Hail-storm in Mr. <HI>Burton</HI>'s surpri|sing
Miracles of Nature, <HI>Page</HI> 180, 181. As
for those sudden Gusts wherewith part of
<PB N="320" REF="176">
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> and several Towns near <HI>New-Ha|ven</HI>
in <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">-E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gland</HI> were Alarm'd, the like
hapned at a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>England,</HI> fourteen years
ago; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> whereof may be seen in
the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Transactions</HI> Numb. 17. <HI>Page</HI>
2156. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> I shall here insert. It is that
which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>Octob.</HI> 30. 1669. betwixt five
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ix of the Clock in the Evening, the
Wind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, at <HI>Ashley</HI> in <HI>North-Hampton|shire,</HI>
hapned a formidable <HI>Hurricane,</HI> scarce
bearing sixty yards in its breadth, and spend|ing
it self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> about seven minutes of time.
Its first disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">n'd assault was upon a Milk-Maid,
taking her Pail and Hat from off her
Head; and carrying it many scores of yards
from her, where it lay undiscovered some
dayes. Next, it storm'd the Yard of one
<HI>Sprigge,</HI> dwelling in <HI>Westthorp</HI> (a name of one
part of the Town) where it blew a Wagon-body
off of the Axel-trees, breaking the
Wheels and Axel-trees in pieces, and blow|ing
three of the Wheels so shattered over a
Wall. The Wagon stood somewhat cross to
the passage of the Wind. Another Wagon
of Mr. Sali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ries marched with great speed
upon its Wheels against the side of his House
to the astonishment of the Inhabitants. A
branch of an <HI>As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">-tree</HI> of that bigness that
two lusty Men could scarce lift it, blew over
<PB N="321" REF="176">
Mr. <HI>Salisburies</HI> House without hurting it;
and yet this Branch was torn from a Tree, an
hundred yards distant from that House. A
Slate was found upon a Window of the house
of <HI>Samuel Templer</HI> Esqr. which very much
bent an Iron Bar in it; and yet tis certain&punc;
that the nearest place, the slate was at first
forced from, was near two hundred yards.
Not to take notice of its stripping of seve|ral
Houses; one thing is remarkable, which
is, that at Mr. <HI>Maidwells</HI> Senior, it forced o|pen
a Door, breaking the Latch, and thence
marching through the Entry, and forcing o|pen
the Dairy Door, it overturned the Milk-Vessels,
and blew out three Panes or Lights
in the Window; next it mounted the Cham|bers,
and blew out nine Lights more: from
thence it proceeded to the Parsonage, whose
Roof it more than Decimated; thence cros|seth
the narrow Street, and forcibly drives a
Man headlong into the Doors of <HI>Tho. Brigges&punc;</HI>
Then it passed with a cursory salute at <HI>Tho|mas
Marstones,</HI> down to Mr. <HI>George Wignils,</HI> at
least a Furlongs distance from <HI>Marstons,</HI> and
two Furlongs from <HI>Sprigges,</HI> where it plaid
notorious Exploits, blowing a large Hovel
of Peas from its Supporters, and settling it
cleaverly upon the ground, without any con|siderable
damage to the Thatch. Here it
<PB N="322" REF="177">
blew a Gate Post, fixed two foot and an half
in the ground, out of the Earth, and carried
it into the Fields, many yards from its first
abode.</P>
<P>Thus much concerning Remarkable
<HI>Tempests.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Earthquakes</HI> deserve to be mentioned a|mongst
<HI>Remarkable Providences,</HI> since <HI>Ari|stotle</HI>
himself could say, that the Man is stupid
and unreasonable who is not affected with
them. This part of the World hath not been
altogether free from such tremendous acci|dents,
albeit, through the gracious providence
of God) there never was yet any harm
done amongst us thereby, so far as I have
heard. The Year 1638. was attended with
a considerable <HI>Earth-quake.</HI> There are who
affirm that they heard a strange kind of noise
before the Earth began to tremble. Another
<HI>Earth-quake</HI> was observed in some parts of
<HI>New-England, Anno Domini</HI> 1658. Also in
in the Year 1662. on the 26, 27, and 28 of
<HI>Ianuary,</HI> the Earth was shaken at least six
times in the space of three dayes. I re|member
that upon the first approach of the
<HI>Earth-quake,</HI> the things on the Shelves in the
House began to move. Many People ran out
of their Houses with fear and amazement:
but no House fell, nor was any damage su|stained.
<PB N="323" REF="177">
There was another <HI>Earth-quake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
April</HI> 3. 1668. We in <HI>Boston</HI> were sensible of
it, but some other parts of the Countrey
were more terribly shaken. The <HI>Indians</HI> say
that the <HI>Earth-quake</HI> this year, did stop the
course of a considerable River. It is also re|ported,
that amongst the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Nova-Sco|tia,</HI>
there hapned an <HI>Earth-quake</HI> which rent
an huge Rock asunder to the center, wherein
was a vast hollow of an immeasurable depth.
Concerning <HI>Earth-quakes</HI> which have lately
hapned in remoter parts of the World&punc; I
shall not here insert any thing, having men|tioned
them in my <HI>Discourse of Comets,</HI> Prin|ted
the last year. Only therein I have not
taken notice of that memorable <HI>Earth-quake&punc;
May</HI> 12. 1682. having received Information
concerning it more lately. Such Readers as
are inquisitive into things of this nature&punc; may
see that <HI>Earth-quake</HI> described and discoursed
on, in the <HI>Weekly Memorials for the Ingenious&punc;
Page</HI> 125, &amp;c. Remarkable was that which
hapned <HI>A. D.</HI> 1670. at a place called <HI>Kene|bunck,</HI>
in the <HI>Province of Main</HI> in <HI>New-En|gland,</HI>
where not far from the River side a
piece of Clay Ground, was thrown up over
the top of high Oakes that grew between it
and the River, into the River, stopping the
course thereof, and leaving an hole forty
<PB N="324" REF="178">
yards square, wherein were thousands of clay
Bullets, like Musket Bullets. It is also re|markable,
that the like to this hapned at
<HI>Casco</HI> (twenty miles to the Eastward of the
other place) much about the same time:
Whether the removal of this ground did pro|ceed
from an <HI>Earth-quake,</HI> or by the eruption
of Mineral Vapors, or from some other
cause, may be disputed. They that would
give a probable conjecture concerning the
natural cause, must first know whether a
great Drought, or much Rain, or both suc|cessively,
did not proceed, of which I am
not informed. The like Memorable acci|dents
have hapned in several places in <HI>En|gland,</HI>
both in the former, and in this present
age; which it may be twill be pleasing and
edifying to some Readers for me here to
commemorate. To proceed. The like to
what hath been related, fell out 1571. in
<HI>Hereford-shire; Marcley Hill,</HI> in the East part of
the Shire; with a roaring noise, removed it
self from the place where it stood, and for
three dayes together travelled from its old
seat. It began first to take its Journey, <HI>Fe|bruary</HI>
17. being Saturday, at six of the clock
at night, and by seven of the clock next
Morning, it had gone forty paces, carrying
with it Sheep in their Cotes, Hedg Rows,
<PB N="325" REF="178">
and Trees, whereof some were overturned&punc;
and some that stood upon the Plain are
firmly growing upon the Hill, those that
were East were turned West, and those in
the West were set in the East. In this Re|move
it overthrew <HI>Kinnaston Chappel,</HI> and
turned two High-wayes near an hundred
yards from their old paths. The Ground that
thus removed was about twenty six Acres,
which opening it self with Rocks and all,
bore the Earth before it for four hundred
yards space, without any stay, leaving Pastu|rage
in place of the Tillage, and the Tillage
overspread the Pasturage. Lastly overwhelm|ing
its lower parts, it mounted to an Hill of
twelve Fathom high, and there rested, after
three dayes Travel. Again on the third of
<HI>Ianuary,</HI> A. D. 1582. at <HI>Hermitage</HI> in <HI>Dor|set-shire,</HI>
a place of ground of three Acres,
removed from its old place (as is testified by
<HI>Stow</HI> in his <HI>Summary)</HI> and was carried over
another Closure where Alders and Willows
grew, the space of forty Rod or Perches, and
stopped the High-way that led to <HI>Corne,</HI> and
the Hedges that it was inclosed with, inclose
it still, and the Trees stand bolt upright, and
the place where this Ground was before, is
left like a great Pit. Also on the fourth of
<HI>August</HI> 1585. at <HI>Motingham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> after a
<PB N="326" REF="179">
very violent Tempest of Thunder and Rain,
the Ground suddenly began to sink, and three
great Elms growing upon it, were carried so
deep into the Earth, that no part of them
could any more be seen. The Hole left is in
compass eighty yards, and a Line of fifty Fa|thom
plummed into it finds no bottom. Al|so
<HI>December</HI> 18. 1596. a mile and half from
<HI>Westram</HI> Southward (which is not many
miles from <HI>Moti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gam)</HI> two Closes lying to|gether,
separated, with an Hedge of Hollow
Ashes; there was found a part thereof twelve
Pearches long, to be sunk six foot and and an
half deep; the next morning fifteen foot
more; the third morning eighty foot more
at the least, and so daily that great Trench of
Ground containing in length about eighty
Pearches, and in breadth twenty eight, began
with the Trees and Hedges on it, to lose it
self from the rest of the Ground lying round
about it, and withal to move and shoot for|ward
day and night for eleven dayes. The
Ground of two Water-pits, the one six foot
deep of Water, the other twelve at the least,
and about four Pearches over in breadth, ha|ving
sundry Tuffs of <HI>Alders</HI> and <HI>Ashes</HI> grow|ing
in the Bottoms, with a great Rock of
Stone under them, were not only removed
out of their places, and carried towards the
<PB N="327" REF="179">
South, at least four Pearches a pieces, but
withal mounted aloft, and become Hills,
with their Sedge, Flags, and black Mud upon
the tops of them, higher than the face of
the Water which they had forsaken) by three
foot, and in the place from which they are
removed; other ground which lay higher
is descended, receiving the Water which lies
upon it. Moreover, in one peace of the
plain Field, there is a great hole made by
linking of the Earth to the depth of thirty
foot at the least, being in breadth in some pla|ces
two Pearches over, and in length five or
six Pearches. Also there an Hedge thirty
Pearches long, carried Southwad with his
Trees, seven Pearches at the least; and sun|dry
other sinkings there be in divers places,
one of sixty Foot, another of forty seven,
and another of thirty four foot, by means of
which confusion is is come to pass, that
where the highest Hills were, there be the
deepest Dales, and the lowest Dales are be|come
the highest Ground. The whole mea|sure
of breaking, was at the least nine Acres.
One Instance more I find to the like purpose
in Mr. <HI>Childrey</HI> his <HI>Britannia Baconica,</HI> pag. 131
where speaking of the natural Rarities of
<HI>Cheshire,</HI> he thus writeth, <HI>Iuly</HI> 1. 1657. a|bout
3. <HI>h.</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Bukley,</HI> was heard a
<PB N="328" REF="180">
very great noise like Thunder afar off, which
was much wondered at, because the sky was
clear, and no appearance of a Cloud. Short|ly
after a Neighbour comes to me (saith the
Author of this Relation) and told me I
should see a very strange thing, if I would
go with him, so coming into a Field, called
the <HI>Lay-field,</HI> we found a very great Bank of
Earth which had many tall Oaks growing
on it, quite sunk under the ground, Trees
and all. At first we durst not go near it, be|cause
the Earth for near twenty yards round
about is exceeding much rent, and seems rea|dy
to fall in; but since that time my self and
some others by Ropes have ventured to see
the bottom, I mean to go to the brink, so as
to discern the visible bottom, which is Wa|ter,
and conceived to be about thirty yards
from us, under which is sunk all the Earth a|bout
it for sixteen yards round at least;
three tall Oaks, a very tall Awber, and cer|tain
other small Trees, and not a sprigg of
them to be seen above water: four or five
Oaks more are expected to fall every moment
and a great quantity of Land is like to fall,
indeed never ceasing more or less, and when
any considerable Clod falls, its much like the
report of a Canon. We can discern the
Ground hollow above the Water a very great
<PB N="329" REF="180">
depth, but how far hollow, or how far deep
is not to be found out by Man. Some of the
water was drawn out of this Pit with a
Bucket, and they found it to be as salt as Sea-water;
whence some imagine that there are
certain large passages there, into which the
Sea flows under ground, but I rather think,
that this Salt-water is no more but that which
issues from those Salt Springs about <HI>Nantwich,</HI>
and other places in this Shire. But of this
no more at present.</P>
<P>Some Remarkable <HI>Land-floods,</HI> have like|wise
hapned in <HI>New, England.</HI> Nor is that
which came to pass this present year to be
here wholly passed over in silence. In the
Spring time the great River at <HI>Connecticot</HI>
useth to overflow, but this year it did so after
Midsummer&punc; and that twice: For <HI>Iuly</HI> 20.
1683. A considerable Flood unexpectedly a|rose,
which proved detrimental to many in
that Colony. But on <HI>August</HI> 13. a second
and a more dreadful Flood came. The Wa|ters
were then observed to rise twenty six
foot above their usual Boundaries. The
Grass in the Meadows, also the English Grain
was carried away before it. The Indian
Corn by the long continuance of the Wa|ters
is spoiled: so that the four River Towns
<HI>viz. Windsor, Hartford, Weathersfield, Middle-Town,</HI>
are extream sufferers. They write
<PB N="330" REF="181">
from thence, that some who had hundreds of
Bushels of Corn in the Morning, at night
had not one Peck left for their Families to
live upon. There is an awful intimation of
Divine Displeasure <HI>Remarkable</HI> in this mat|ter;
inasmuch as <HI>August</HI> 8. a day of pub|lick
Humiliation with Fasting and Prayer,
was attended in that Colony, partly on the
account of Gods hand against them in the
former Flood; the next week after which,
the hand of God was stretched out over them
again, in the same way, after a more terrible
manner then at first. It is also <HI>Remarkable</HI>
that so many places should suffer by inunda|tions
as this year it hath been. For at the
very same time when the Flood hapned at
<HI>Connecticot,</HI> there was an <HI>Hurricane</HI> in <HI>Virgi|nia</HI>
attended with a great exundation of the
Rivers there, so as that their Tobacco and
their Indian Corn is very much damnified.
Moreover, we have received Information this
Summer, that the mighty River <HI>Danow</HI> (the
biggest in <HI>Europe</HI>) hath overflowed its Banks,
by means whereof many have lost their lives.
Also near <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> there lately hapned
an unusual Flood, whereby much harm was
done; and had the Waters continued rising
but one hour longer, the City had probably
been destroyed thereby. There was likewise
<PB N="331" REF="181">
a sudden and extraordinary Flood in <HI>Iamai|co,</HI>
which drowned many (both Men and
Beast) and was very detrimental to some
Plantations there. They that came lately
from thence, assure us that the Waters in
some places arose an hundred and fifty foot.
Such mighty Streams did the Heavens sud|denly
power down upon them. Thus doth
the great God <HI>Who sits King upon the Floods
for ever,</HI> make the World see how many
wayes he hath to punish them, when it shall
seem good unto him. Many such things are
with him. There are who think that the
last Comet, and those more rare Conjuncti|ons
of the <HI>Superiour Planets,</HI> hapning this
Year, have had a natural influence into the
mentioned Inundations. Concerning the
Flood at <HI>Connecticot,</HI> as for the more immedi|ate
natural cause, some impute it to the great
Rain which preceded. Others did imagine
that some more than usual <HI>Cataracts</HI> did fall
amongst the Mountains, there having been
more Rain then what now fell, sometimes
when no such Flood has followed. It is not
impossible, but that the Wind might be a se|condary
cause of this Calamity; Judicious
Observators write concerning the River
<HI>Dee</HI> in <HI>Cheshire</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> that though much
Rain do fall, it riseth but little, but if the South
<PB N="332" REF="182">
Wind beat vehemently upon it, then it swells
and overflows the Grounds adjoyning ex|treamly;
the reason of which is, that the Ri|ver
being broad towards the Sea, when the
Rain falls it hath a quick and easie passage,
but the South Wind brings the Sea in, and
doth somewhat stop the free passage of the
River into the Sea. Whether there might
not be some such natural reason of the great
Flood in <HI>Connecticot</HI> at this time; the inge|nious
upon the place, who know best how
things are there circumstanced may consider.
With us in <HI>Boston</HI> it was then at first an <HI>Euro|clydon;</HI>
but in the afternoon the Wind be|came
Southerly, when it blew with the great|est
fierceness. If it were so at <HI>Connecticot,</HI> it
seems very probable that the fury of the wind
gave a check to the free passage of the Ri|ver,
which caused the sudden overflowing of
the Waters. It has moreover been by some
observed, that the breaking forth of subter|raneous
Waters has caused very prodigious
Floods. Since the dayes of <HI>Noah,</HI> when the
Fountains of the great Deep were opened,
no History mentions a more surprizing and
amazing Inundation than that which hap|ned
five years ago at <HI>Gascoyn</HI> in <HI>France</HI>) pro|ceeding
(as tis probably judged) from the
irruption of Waters out of the Earth. Con|cerning
<PB N="333" REF="182">
which Remarkable accident, a judi|cious
account is given in the late <HI>Philosophi|cal
Collections,</HI> published by Mr. <HI>Robert Hook,
Page</HI> 9. There being but one of these Books
in the Countrey; the Ingenious will not
blame me, if I here insert what is there Re|lated,
which is as followeth;</P>
<Q><P>In the beginning of the Moneth of <HI>Iu|ly,</HI>
1678. after some gentle rainy dayes
which had not swelled the Waters of the
<HI>Garonne</HI> more than usual; one night this
River swelled all at once so mightily, that
all the Bridges and Mills above <HI>Tolouse</HI>
were carried away by it. In the Plains
which were below this Town, the Inhabi|tants
who had built in places, which by
long Experience they had found safe e|nough
from any former Inundation, were
by this surprized, some were drowned to|gether
with their Cattle; others had not
saved themselves but by climbing of Trees,
and getting to the tops of Houses; and
some others which were looking after their
Cattle in the Field, warned by the noise
which this horrible and furious Torrent of
Water (rowling towards them with a swift|ness
like that of the Sea (in <HI>Britain</HI> he
means) made at a distance, could not scape
without being overtaken, though they fled
<PB N="334" REF="183">
with much precipitation: this nevertheless
did not last many hours with this violence.
At the same time Exactly, the two Rivers
only of <HI>Adour</HI> and <HI>Gave,</HI> which fall from
the <HI>Pyraenean Hills,</HI> as well as the <HI>Geronne,</HI>
and some other small Rivers of <HI>Gascoyn,</HI>
which have their Source in the plain, as the
<HI>Gimone,</HI> the <HI>Save</HI> and the <HI>Ratt,</HI> overflowed
after the same manner, and caused the same
Devastations. But this Accident hapned
not at all to the <HI>Aude,</HI> the <HI>Ariege,</HI> or the
<HI>Arise&punc;</HI> which come from the Mountains of
<HI>Toix,</HI> only that they had more of the same
then those of the <HI>Conseraut,</HI> the <HI>Comminge,</HI>
the <HI>Bigorre.</HI> Those who have heard talk
of those Inundations at a distance, were
not at all astonished at it, believing it to pro|ceed
from the violent Rains of some Tem|pests
which had suddenly filled these Ri|vers,
or that they had caused a sudden
Thaw of the Snow of the <HI>Pyraeneans,</HI> which
had swelled the Rivers that were near.</P><P><HI>Monsieur Martel</HI> of <HI>Montabaun,</HI> Advocate
of the Parliament, and Inquisitive and Lear|ned
Man hath searched after this cause of
this Deluge (by the order of <HI>Monsieur Fou|cault
Intendant de Iustice en la generalite de
montaban,</HI> one not less seeing and under|standing
in ingenious Sciences, than expert
<PB N="335" REF="183">
and exact in the performance of his charge
and imployment) understanding that this
overflowing could not be produced by ei|ther
of the forementioned causes, and be|ing
assured that it must have had one more
extraordinary than all these.</P><P>And first he grounded his thoughts upon
the report of the People of the place who
were witnesses of this Prodigy. And above
all of those who being in the highest Val|leys
of the <HI>Pyraeneans</HI> at the very Source,
had either seen or known all circumstances,
for they all agreed, that it had rained indeed
but that the Rain was neither so great, nor
lasted so long as to swell the Rivers to that
excess, or to melt the Snow off the Moun|tains.
But the nature of these Waters,
and the manner of their flowing from the
Mountains, confirmed him perfectly in his
Sentiments. For, 1. The <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of
the <HI>Lower Pyraeneans</HI> observed, that the Wa|ters
overflowed with violence from the En|trails
of the Mountains, about which there
were opened several Channels, which form|ing
so many furious Torrents tore up the
trees, the Earth and great Rocks in such nar|row
places where they found not a passage
large enough. The Water which also
spouted from all the sides of the Mountain
<PB N="336" REF="184">
in innumerable Jets, which lasted all the
time of the greatest overflowing, had the
tast of Minerals.</P><P N="2">2. In some of these passages the Waters
were stinking (as when one stirs the mud
at the bottom of Mineral Water) in such
sort that the Cattle refused to drink of it,
which was more particularly taken notice
at <HI>Lombez,</HI> in the overflowing of the <HI>Save,</HI>
(which is one of the Rivers) where the
Horses were eight hours thirsty before they
would endure to drink it.</P><P N="3">3. The Bishop of <HI>Lombez</HI> having a de|sire
to cleanse his Gardens, which the <HI>Save</HI>
passing through by many Channels by this
overflowing, had filled with much Sand and
Mud; those which entred them felt an
itching like to that which one feels when
one Bathes in Salt-water, or washes one
self with some strong Lixivial: these Wa|ters
have caused the same kind of itching
risings in the skin. This last Observation
is not less strong then both the others to
prove&punc; that this over-flowing was not either
caused by the Rains, or by the meltings of
the Snow, because this itching could not be
produced by either of the said Waters,
which are not at all of this nature, but by
some Mineral juice, either <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">riolic</HI> or <HI>Alu|minous,</HI>
<PB N="337" REF="184">
which the Waters had dissolved in
the Bowels of the Mountains, and had car|ried
along with it in passing through those
numerous Crannies. And tis for this rea|son
that <HI>Monsieur Martel</HI> believes he had
found out the true cause of this overflow|ing
to be nothing else but the subterraneous
Waters; for if the Heavens have not sup|plied
his prodigious quantity of Waters,
neither by the Rain, nor the melting of the
Snow: it cannot come else where then from
the Bowels of the Earth, from whence pas|sing
through divers Channels, it had con|tracted
and carried along with it that stink|ing
and pungent quality.</P></Q>

Hand of Heaven has executed upon
notorious Sinners, are to be reckoned a|mongs
<HI>Remarkable Providences. Lubricus
his locus &amp; difficilis.</HI> He undertakes a diffi|cult
province that shall relate all that might
be spoken on such a Subject, both in that it
cannot but be gravaminous to surviving Re|lations,
when such things are published, also
in that men are apt to misapply the unsear|chable
Judgements of God, which are a great
deep, as <HI>Iob</HI>'s Friends did; and wicked <HI>Pa|pists</HI>
have done the like, with respect to the
untimely death of famous <HI>Zuinglius.</HI> We
<PB N="339" REF="185">
may not judge of Men meerly by outward
accidents which befal them in this World,
since all things happen alike unto all, and
no man knoweth either love or hatred by all
that is before them. We have seen amongst
our selves, that the Lords faithful Servants
have sometimes been the Subjects of very
dismal dispensations. There hapned a most
awful providence at <HI>Farmington</HI> in <HI>Connecticot</HI>
Colony, <HI>Dec.</HI> 14. 1666. When the House of
Serjeant <HI>Iohn Hart</HI> taking fire in the night,
no man knows how, (only it is conjectured
that it might be occasioned by an Oven) he
and his Wife, and six Children were all
burned to death before the Neighbours knew
any thing of it, so that his whole Family had
been extinguished by the fatal Flames of that
unhappy night, had not one of his Children
been providentially from home at that time.
This <HI>Hart</HI> was esteemed a choice Christian,
and his Wife also a good Woman. Such
things sometimes fall upon those that are
dear unto God, to intimate, <HI>if this be done to
the green tree, what shall be done to the dry,</HI> that
is fit for nothing but the fire. Nevertheless,
a Judgement may be so circumstanced, as
that the displeasure of Heaven is plainly
written upon it, in legible Characters. On
which account it is said, <HI>that the wrath of God
<PB N="340" REF="186">
is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness
and unrighteousness of Men,</HI> Rom. 1. 18. Sun|dry
Learned Men have published whole Vo|lumns
profitable to be read, on this Subject,
<HI>e. g. Goulartius</HI> his Historical Collections.
<HI>Honsdorsius</HI> in his Historical Theater; which
is inlarged by <HI>Lonicerus. Chassalion</HI> his me|morable

And amongst our <HI>English</HI> Writers, D. <HI>Beard</HI>
in his Theater of Gods Judgements, with Dr.
<HI>Taylor</HI>'s Additions; and Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in his two
Volumns of Examples, have said enough to
convince Atheists that there is a God, and
that there is a Judgement. Yea, the divine
providence in Remarkable Punishments in|flicted
upon very wicked men has been so
conspicuous and glorious, as that the Gentiles
of old could not but take notice of it. The
Poet could say, <HI>Raro antecedentem scelestum
deseruit pede paena claudo.</HI> And whereas <HI>Epi|cures</HI>
did object that evil men sometimes escape
punishment a long time; <HI>Plutarch</HI> (whose
works <HI>Beza</HI> esteemed to be amongst the most
excellent of Humane Writings) has a notable
Treatise, the design whereof is to vindicate
divine Justice in this matter. Many Re|markable
Example to our present purpose,
have hapned in <HI>New-England,</HI> and more than
I shall at present take notice of. All wise
<PB N="341" REF="186">
men that are acquainted therewith, observe
the blasting rebukes of providence upon the
late <HI>Singing and Dancing Quakers,</HI> in signal
Instances, two or three of which may be
here Recorded, that so others may hear and
fear and do no more so wickedly.</P>
<P>The first instance, shall be that which con|cerns
the unhappy man that was Murdered
in <HI>Long-Island,</HI> of which a good hand in those
parts, in a Letter bearing Date, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 12.
1681. writes as follows. <Q>There went down
about a Moneth since three mad <HI>Quakers,</HI>
called <HI>Thomas Case's</HI> Crew, one man named
<HI>Denham,</HI> belonging to <HI>Newer-snicks,</HI> and two
Women with him belonging to <HI>Oyster-Bay;</HI>
these went down to <HI>South-hold,</HI> where they
meet with <HI>Samuel Banks</HI> of <HI>Fairfield,</HI> the
most Blasphemous Villain, that ever was
known in these parts. These joyning to|gether
with some other Inhabitants of <HI>South-hold,</HI>
of the same spirit; there went into their
company a young Merchant, named <HI>Tho|mas
Harris,</HI> who was somewhat inclining to
the <HI>Quakers</HI> before; (he belonged to <HI>Boston)</HI>
they all got about him, and fell a Dancing
and Singing, according to their Diabolical
manner. After some time, the said <HI>Harris</HI>
began to act like them, and to Dance, and
sing, and to speak of extraordinary raptures
<PB N="342" REF="187">
of joy; and to cry out upon all others as
Devils, that were not of their Religion;
which also they do frequently: when the
said <HI>Harris</HI> manifested these signs of Con|version,
as they accounted it; they solemn|ly
accepted of him as one of their company;
and <HI>Banks</HI> or <HI>Denham</HI> (for I have forgot|ten
which of the two) gave him this pro|mise,
<HI>that hence forward his Tongue should be
as the Pen of a ready Writer, to declare the
praises of their Lord.</HI> After this, the young
man who was sober and composed before,
ran up and down, <HI>Singing Ioy,</HI> and calling
such Devils as should say any thing in way
of opposition: and said his Father was a
Devil that begat him. Quickly after he
went from the Town of <HI>South-hold,</HI> to a
Farm belonging to that Town, to the house
of a <HI>Quaker</HI> of the same spirit, and went
to bed before the rest of the Family, and
when a young man of the same house went
to go to bed to him, he told him that he
must get up, and go to <HI>South-hold</HI> that night,
where he had left <HI>Banks</HI> and the rest; the
young man endeavoured to perswade him
to lie still till day, but he would not, but gat
up, and went away; after some time he
was missed, and enquiry made for him, but
he could not be heard of, only his Hat, and
<PB N="343" REF="187">
Gloves, and Neck-cloth was found in the
Road from the Farm to the Town. And
two dayes after, <HI>Banks</HI> looking into a Bible,
suddenly shut it again, crying out, his friend
<HI>Harris</HI> was dead; the next day he was
found by the Sea side, about a quarter of a
mile from the place, where his hat and o|ther
things were found, but out of the road,
with three holes like stabs in his throat, and
no Tongue in his Head, nor the least
sign thereof, but all was clear to his Neck-bone
within, his mouth close shut, one of his
Eyes hanging down upon his cheek out of
his head, the other sunk so deep in his head
that at first it seemed quite out, but was
whole there. And Mr. <HI>Ioshua Hobart,</HI> who
was one of them to view his dead Body,
told me that there was no sign of any
Tongue left in his Mouth, <HI>such was the end
of that Tongue which had the promise of being
as the Pen of a ready Writer.</HI> Further the
night after he was buried, Captain <HI>Young</HI>
(who is high Sheriff and chiefly concerned
in looking after the business) as he told me
himself, being in bed, in the dead of the
night, was awakened by the voice of this
<HI>Harris,</HI> calling to his Window very loud,
requiring him to see that justice was done
him; This voice came three times in that
<PB N="344" REF="188">
night; the next night when he was asleep,
it came into his house, close to his Bed-side,
and called very loud, asking him if he heard
him, and awaked him.</Q> Thus concern|ing
that Tragical Story.</P>
<P>An intelligent and credible person living
upon that Island, in a Letter, Dated <HI>Septem|ber</HI>
4. 1683. adds as follows; <Q>There was a|bout
four years since, by some of the same
crew, another attempt made amongst us,
which was also attended with the like pro|vidence,
though not so fatal an issue; There
was a young Woman, a Daughter of a <HI>Qua|ker</HI>
among us, who was howled into their
Society, as <HI>Harris</HI> was, and quickly fell to
railing on others, and then to raving, being
in a dreadful condition, so that several per|sons
of their Gang watched with her, and
she was made wonderful strong to out|strive
them, and to break away from them.
One of their own party newly in favour
with them, told me that he was by in the
night when they watched with her, and in
the very darkness of the night, they heard a
very doleful noise, like the crying of a
young Child in the yard or field near the
house, which filled the Auditors with some
fearful Apprehensions, which when the
<PB N="345" REF="188">
young Woman heard, she violently brake
from her Attendance, saying, <HI>the Lord calls
me, and I must go,</HI> so in the dark she got
from them, to the cry-ward as they suppo|sed,
and it was a good space of time before
they could find her, and then she was as one
affrighted, and bereaved of understanding,
and continued so a space of time, sometimes
ridiculous to behold, sometimes very awful,
till such times as Justice <HI>Wood</HI> of <HI>Huntington,</HI>
by the use of means recovered her, which
her <HI>Quaking Friends</HI> notwithstanding their
brags could not do; so that I heard her
Husband say, <HI>that he was convinced that the
Devil was among them.</HI> This Providence was
at that time fearful among us, yet since, both
that Woman and her Husband are railing
<HI>Quakers,</HI> and do Hum and Revile as the rest
of them, though several forsook their Socie|ty
upon this account.</Q> Thus Hee:</P>
<P>That which was perpetrated by this woful
Generation of <HI>Quakers,</HI> no longer since than
this last Summer in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony, is horrid
to be related. Yet inasmuch as the publica|tion
of it, will make appear unto all Man|kind,
that <HI>Quakers</HI> are under the strong de|lusions
of Satan; I think my self bound to
acquaint the World, that not many Moneths
ago, a Man passing under the name of <HI>Iona|than
<PB N="346" REF="189">
Dunen</HI> (alias <HI>Singleterry)</HI> a <HI>Singing
Quaker,</HI> drew away the Wife of one of
<HI>Marshfield</HI> to follow him; Also one <HI>Mary
Ross</HI> falling into their company, was quickly
possessed with the Devil, playing such Fren|tick
and Diabolical tricks, as the like hath
seldom been known or heard of. For she
made her self naked, burning all her Clothes;
and with infinite Blasphemy said that she was
Christ, and gave names to her Apostles, cal|ling
<HI>Dunen</HI> by the name of <HI>Peter,</HI> another by
the name of <HI>Thomas,</HI> declaring that she would
be dead for three dayes, and then rise again;
and accordingly seemed to die; and while
she was pretendedly dead, her Apostle <HI>Dunen</HI>
gave out, that they should see glorious things
after her Resurrection. But that which she
then did, was, she commanded <HI>Dunen</HI> to Sa|crifice
a Dog. The Man and the two Wo|men
<HI>Quakers</HI> Danced naked together, ha|ving
nothing but their shirts on. The Con|stable
brought them before the Magistrates
in <HI>Plimouth,</HI> where <HI>Ross</HI> uttered such prodi|gious
Blasphemy as is not fit to be mentioned,
<HI>Dunen</HI> fell down like a dead Man upon the
floor, and so lay for about an hour, and then
came to himself. The Magistrates demand|ing
the reason of his strange actings, his An|swer
was, that <HI>Marry Ross</HI> bid him, and he
<PB N="347" REF="189">
had no power to resist. Thus when Men
will not receive the Truth in the love of it,
the righteous Judgement of God sends upon
them <HI>the efficacy of Error,</HI> that they shall be|lieve
a lie. That the <HI>Quakers</HI> are some of
them undoubtedly possessed with Evil and
Infernal Spirits, and acted in a more than or|dinary
manner by the inmates of Hell, is e|vident,
not only from the related Instances,
but by other awful Examples which might
be mentioned. They are indeed to be pi|tied,
in that they themselves know not that
an Evil Spirit doth possess and act them. Yet
others should from that consideration dread
to come among such Creatures, lest haply the
Righteous God suffer Satan to take possession
of them also. Memorable and marvelous
is that Relation published the last year, by
Dr. <HI>Henry More,</HI> in his addition to Mr. <HI>Glan|vils
Collections,</HI> Page 58. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherein a true
and faithful account is given of a Man whose
Name is <HI>Robert Churchman,</HI> living at <HI>Balsham</HI>
in <HI>Cambridge-shire,</HI> who was for some time in|veigled
in <HI>Quakerisme,</HI> and then an Infernal
Spirit spake in him, pretending to be an An|gel
of Light. Inasmuch as there is (so far
as I have heard) but one of those Books in
this Countrey; I suppose it will be a service
for the Truth, and may (if the Lord please
<PB N="348" REF="190">
to add his blessing) tend to reclaim some
from the error of their way, and to deterr
those from <HI>Quakerisme</HI> who have through
the temptations of Satan any inclinations
thereunto, if that notable History should be
more divulged; I shall therefore here insert
it. And thus it was, Dr. <HI>Templar</HI> (the Mini|ster
in <HI>Balsham)</HI> perceiving that <HI>Robert
Churchman</HI> was in danger of being poysoned
and seduced by the papers which the <HI>Qua|kers</HI>
had been dispersing in that place, desired
him, that when any of their Books came to
his hands, he might have the perusal of them.
Which being granted, he suggested that it
would be very convenient that the person
who had given him that Book should be pre|sent
when they considered it together. This
also was consented to. When the <HI>Quaker</HI>
came, a special subject of the Discourse was,
<HI>Whether the Scripture is to be owned as a Rule:</HI>
This the <HI>Quaker</HI> denied, asserting that the
Rule was within them. Hereupon Dr. <HI>Tem|plar</HI>
desired <HI>Churchman</HI> to take notice, that
the <HI>Quakers</HI> did not own the Scriptures to
be their Rule, which before this Conference
he would not believe concerning them. The
next time he met with his Brother <HI>Thomas
Churchman,</HI> he acquainted him with the Con|ference
which had been in Dr. <HI>Templars</HI>
<PB N="349" REF="190">
House, and said for his part he would not be
of that Religion which did disown the Scri|pture
to be the Rule. Not long after, the
Wife of the forementioned <HI>Quaker</HI> coming
to his House to visit his Wife, he met her at
the door, and told her she should not come
in, intimating that her visit would make di|vision
betwixt them. After some Parley the
<HI>Quakers</HI> Wife spake unto him in these words,
<HI>Thou wilt not believe unless thou see a sign, and
thou mayest see some such.</HI> Within a few
nights after, <HI>Robert Churchman</HI> had a violent
Storm upon the room where he lay, when
it was very calm in all other parts of the
Town, and a voice within him, as he was in
Bed, spake to him, and bid him <HI>Sing Praises,
Sing Praises;</HI> telling him, that he should see
the Glory of the <HI>New Ierusalem;</HI> about
which time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>glimmering Light</HI> appeared all
about the room. Toward the morning the
<HI>Voice</HI> commanded him to go out of his Bed
naked, with his Wife and Children. They
all standing upon the Floor, the <HI>Spirit</HI> ma|king
use of his Tongue, bid them to lie
down and put their Mouthes in the dust&punc;
which they did accordingly. It likewise
commanded them to go and call his Brother
and Sister, that they might see the <HI>New-Ie|rusalem,</HI>
to whom he went naked about half
a mile.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="191">
When he had delivered his Message, that
which spake within him to denounce wrath
against them, and declare that Fire and Brim|stone
would fall upon them, as it did upon
<HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> if they did not obey;
and so he returned to his own house. Where
upon the Floor of a low room, he stood-about
three or four hours. All that
while he was acted in a very unusual man|ner,
sometimes the <HI>Spirit within</HI> forced him
to <HI>Sing,</HI> sometimes to Bark like a Dog.
When his Brother and Sister who followed
him were very importunate with him to re|sist
it, it bid him to kill them, making use of
these words, <HI>These my Enemies which would
not that I should Reign over them, bring them
and slay them before my face.</HI> It made him to
utter with great readiness; many places of
Scripture, which he had no knowledge of
before. The drift of what was spoken, was
to perswade him to comply with the <HI>Qua|kers,</HI>
and it named some which lived in the
Neighbouring Towns. About three or four
hours being thus spent, he came to himself,
and was able to give a perfect account of
what had be fallen him.</P>
<P>Several nights after, the same trouble re|turned
upon him. His Wife was tortured
with extraordinary pains; the Children
<PB N="351" REF="191">
which lay in the room, complained that their
Mouthes were stopped with Wool as they
were in Bed. The disturbance was so great,
that he had thoughts of leaving his House
for a time, and made it his desire to be at Dr.
<HI>Templars;</HI> who prevailed with him not to be
so sudden in his removal, but to make some
further Trial. It pleased God upon a con|tinuation
with him in Prayer every day in the
house, that he was at last perfectly free
from all molestation. The <HI>Quakers</HI> hearing
of his condition, gave it out, that the power
of God would come upon him again, and
that the Wound was but skinned over by the
Priest. Which made Dr. <HI>Templar</HI> the more
importunate with him to keep close to the
Publick Worship of God, and to have no|thing
to do with them or their Writings.
Which direction he followed till <HI>November</HI>
1661. and then perusing one of their
Books, a little after upon the tenth day of
that Moneth his troubles returned. A voice
within him began to speak to him after the
former manner. The first Sentence which
it uttered was, <HI>Cease thou from Man, whose
breath is in his Nostrils, for wherein is he to be
accounted.</HI> The design which he discerned
it did aim at, was to take him off from come|ing
to the Church (where he had been that
<PB N="352" REF="192">
day) and from hearing the Word of God
It suggested several other Scriptures in order
to the perswading of him to a compliance
with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and told him, that it would
strive with him as the Angel did with <HI>Iacob,</HI>
until the breaking of the Day, at which time
it left him. The two next nights it gave him
the same molestation, saying, it must be with
him as it was with <HI>David,</HI> who <HI>gave no sleep
to his eyes, nor slumber to his eye-lids, until he
found a place for the Lord, an habitation for the
mighty God of Iacob.</HI> Upon Wednesday at
night he was very peremptory in his resisting
of it. When it began to solicit him, he re|plied,
that he saw it was a Spirit of delusion,
which he would not obey. Upon which the
Spirit deno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nced a Curse against him in these
words, <HI>Go ye Cursed into everlasting fire,</HI> and
so left him with a very great heat in his Bo|dy.
After this, he was in his own apprehen|sion
in a very comfortable condition, and
while he was considering what had hapned,
a voice within him speake to him, saying,
That the Spirit which was before upon him
was a Spirit of Delusion, but now the true
Spirit of God was come into him. It ac|quainted
him, that the Doctrine of the Trini|ty
was true, and that God had an Elect Peo|ple,
and that those whom the Father Elected
<PB N="353" REF="192">
the Son hath Redeemed, and when Christ
Redeemeth, the Holy Ghost Sanctifieth, and
told him that the Minister of the Town
would further instruct him about the truth
of these things. Upon Thursday morning
about break of day, it set him upon his knees
as he was in bed, and bid him Farewel. The
same day it came upon him in the field as he
was going to, and coming from the Market,
&amp; pressed upon him to believe that it was the
good Spirit which he was acted with, which
he still doubted of. One night that week a|mongst
many Arguments which it used to
that purpose, it told him if he would not
believe without a sign, he might have what
sign he would. Upon that <HI>Robert Church|man</HI>
desired, if it was a good Spirit, that a
Wier-Candlestick which stood upon the
Cup-board might be turned into Brass, which
the Spirit said he would do. Presently there
was a very unsavoury smell in the Room, like
that of the snuff of a Candle newly put out;
but nothing else was done towards the fulfil|ling
of the promise. Upon the Lords Day
following, he then attending the publick
Worship of God, it came upon him. When
the Chapters were named, he turned to them
in his Bible, but was not able to read. When
the Psalm was Sung, he could not pronounce
<PB N="354" REF="193">
a syllable. Upon Monday morning his
Speech was wholly taken away from him.
When the Minister in that place came to
him, and asked him how it was with him, he
moved his head towards him, but was not
able to speak; the Minister waited an hour
or two in the Room, hoping that his Speech
might have returned unto him, and that he
might have gained from him some account of
his condition. But finding no alteration, he
desired those who were present to joyn with
him in Prayer. As they were Praying
<HI>Churchman</HI>'s Body was with much violence
thrown out of Bed, and then with great ve|hemency
he called to the Minister Dr. <HI>Tem|plar</HI>
to hold his tongue. When Prayer was
done, his Tongue was bound as before, till at
last he broke out into these words: <HI>Thine is
the Kingdom, Thine is the Kingdom;</HI> which he
repeated (as was judged) above an hundred
times. Sometimes he was forced into ex|tream
Laughter, <HI>sometimes into Singing,</HI> his
hands were usually imployed in beating his
Breast. All of them who stood by, could
discern unusual heavings in his Body. This
Distemper did continue towards the morn|ing
of the next day, and then the voice
within him signified to him that it would
leave him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> him get upon his Knees
<PB N="355" REF="193">
in order to that end, which he did, and then
presently he had a perfect command of him|self.</P>
<P>When Dr. <HI>Templar</HI> came to him, he gave
a sober account of all the passages of the day
before, having a distinct remembrance of
what the Spirit forced him to do, and what
was spoken to him by those that stood by.
In particular he told the Doctor that he was
compelled to give him that disturbance in
Prayer, before-mentioned; the Spirit using
his Limbs and Tongue, as it pleased, contrary
to the inclination of his own mind.</P>
<P>Upon the Thursday following, the Spirit
began to rage after its former manner, as
Dr. <HI>Templar</HI> was at Prayer with him, it was
very discernable how it wrought upon his
Body, forced him to grate his Teeth, and
draw his Mouth awry. He told the Mini|ster
after he had done, that it bid him to de|nounce
woe against him. It pleased God
upon continuance in prayer with him, at last
to release him of all his trouble, and so far to
make it advantagious to him and to his Wife,
and some others, which were too much by-assed
with the Principles of the <HI>Quakers,</HI>
that now they have a perfect dislike of that
way, and do diligently attend upon the pub|lick
Worship of God.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="194">
Thus concerning this strange but true Re|lation.
We may by this judge whose Ser|vants
the singing <HI>Quakers</HI> are; and what
Spirit doth powerfully breath in, and act
those miserable and deluded <HI>Enthusiasts.</HI></P>
<P>But I shall say no more to the <HI>Quakers</HI> at
present; only pray that such of them as
have not <HI>sinned unto Death,</HI> may have their
eyes opened, and (if possible) be delivered
out of the snares of Satan, <HI>by whom they are
taken Captive at his will.</HI></P>
<P>It hath been by many observed, that Men
addicted to horrid Cursings and Execrations,
have pulled down the imprecated vengeance
of Heaven upon themselves. Sundry very
awful Examples of this kind have lately hap|ned:
I shall here mention one or two.</P>
<P>The hand of God was very <HI>Remarkable,</HI>
in that which came to pass in the <HI>Narragan|set
Countrey</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> not many weeks
since. For I have good Information, that on
<HI>August</HI> 28, 1683. A Man there (viz. <HI>Samuel
Wilson)</HI> having caused his Dog to mischief
his Neighbours Cattle, was blamed for his so
doing. He denied the fact with Impreca|tions,
wishing that he might never stir from
that place if he had so done. His Neighbour
being troubled at his denying the truth, re|proved
<PB N="357" REF="194">
him, and told him he did very ill to
deny what his Conscience knew to be truth.
The <HI>Atheist</HI> thereupon used the Name of
God in his Imprecations; saying, <HI>He wished
to God he might never stir out of that place, if
he had done that which he was charged with.</HI>
The words were scarce out of his mouth be|fore
he sunk down dead, and never stirred
more; a Son in Law of his standing by and
catching him as he fell to the ground.</P>
<P>A thing not unlike to this hapned (though
not in <HI>New-England</HI> yet) in <HI>America,</HI> about
a year ago. For in <HI>September</HI> 1682. A man
at the Isle of <HI>Providence</HI> belonging to a Ves|sel
whereof one <HI>Wollery</HI> was Master, being
charged with some deceit in a matter that had
been committed to him, in order to his own
Vindication, horridly wished <HI>that the Devil
might put out his eyes, if he had done as was
suspected concerning him.</HI> That very night
a Rhume fell into his Eyes, so as that within
a few dayes he became stark blind. His com|pany
being astonished at the Divine hand
which thus conspicuously and signally ap|peared;
put him ashore at <HI>Providence,</HI> and
left him there. A Physitian being desired to
undertake his Cure, hearing how he came to
lose his sight, refused to meddle with him.
This account I lately received from credible
<PB N="358" REF="195">
persons, who knew and have often seen the
Man whom the Devil (according to his own
wicked wish) made blind, through the dread|ful
and righteous judgement of God.</P>
<P>Moreover, that worse than bruitish sin of
<HI>Drunkenness,</HI> hath been witnessed against
from Heaven by <HI>severe and signal Iudgements.</HI>
It was a sign of the fearful Wrath of God,
upon that notorious Drunkard, at a place
called <HI>Seatucket</HI> in <HI>Long-Island;</HI> who as he
was in Drink, fell into the Fire (the People
in the House then being in Bed and asleep)
and so continued for some considerable time,
until he received his Deaths wound. At his
first awakening he roared out <HI>Fire! Fire!</HI> as
if it had been one in Hell, to the great a|stonishment
of all that heard him. One in
the House flung a pail of Water on him to
quench his Clothes, but that added to his tor|ment;
so he continued yelling after an hi|deous
manner, <HI>Fire! Fire!</HI> and within a day
or two died in great misery. And though
this Drunkard died by fire, it is <HI>Remarkable</HI>
that many of those who have loved drink,
have died by water, and that at the very time
when their understandings have been
drowned with Drink. It is an awful consi|ration,
that there have been at several times
above forty persons in this Land, whom death
<PB N="359" REF="195">
hath found in that woful plight, so that their
immortal Souls have gone out of Drunken
Bodies, to appear before God the Judge
of all.</P>
<P>That <HI>Remarkable Iudgement</HI> hath first or
last fallen upon those who have sought the
hurt of the People of God in <HI>New-England,</HI>
is so notorious, as that it is become the ob|servation
of every Man. This <HI>Israel</HI> in the
Wilderness hath eat up the Nations his Ene|mies,
he hath broke their Bones, and pierced
them through with his Arrows. Some Ad|versaries
have escaped longer unpunished
than others; but then their ends have been
of all the most woful, and tragical at last.
I shall instance only in what hath lately come
to pass, with respect unto the Heathen who
rose up against us, thinking to swallow us up
quick, when their Wrath was kindled against
us. Blessed be the Lord, who hath not gi|ven
us a prey to their Teeth. The Chief|tains
amongst them were all cut off, either
by Sword or Sickness in the War time, ex|cepting
those in the Eastern parts, whose
Ring-leaders outlived their fellows; but now
God hath met with them. There were in
special two of those <HI>Indians,</HI> who shed much
innocent Blood, <HI>viz. Simon</HI> and <HI>Squando.</HI>
<PB N="360" REF="196">
As for bloody <HI>Simon,</HI> who was wont to boast
of the Mischiefs he had done, and how he
had treacherously shot and killed such and
such <HI>English-men,</HI> he died miserably the last
Winter, Another <HI>Indian</HI> discharging a
Gun hapned to shoot <HI>Simon,</HI> so as to break
his Arm. After which he lived two years,
but in extremity of pain, so as that the <HI>In|dians</HI>
when enquired of, how <HI>Simon</HI> did;
their usual Answer was <HI>Worse then Dead.</HI>
He used all means that Earth and Hell (for
he betook himself to <HI>Powaws)</HI> could afford
him for his recovery, but in vain. Thus
was the wickedness of that Murtherer at
last returned upon his own head.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Squando,</HI> the <HI>Sachem</HI> of the
<HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Saco;</HI> the Story of him is upon
sundry accounts <HI>Remarkable.</HI> Many years
ago he was sick, and near unto death, after
which he said, that one pretending to be the
<HI>English-mans</HI> God, appeared to him in form
of an <HI>English Minister;</HI> and discoursed with
him, requiring him to leave off his drinking
of <HI>Rum,</HI> and religiously to observe the Sab|bath
day, and to deal justly amongst Men,
withal promising him that if he did so, then
at death his Soul should go upwards to an
happy place; but if he did not obey these
commandments, at death his Soul should go
<PB N="361" REF="196">
downwards, and be for ever miserable. But
this pretended God said nothing to him a|bout
<HI>Iesus Christ.</HI> However, this <HI>Apparition</HI>
so wrought upon <HI>Squando,</HI> as that he left his
Drunkenness, and became a strict observer
of the Sabbath day; Yea, so as that he al|wayes
kept it as a day of Fast, and would
hear the <HI>English Ministers</HI> Preach, and was
very just in his dealing. But in the time of
the late <HI>Indian War,</HI> he was a principal Actor
in the bloody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> in that part of the
Countrey. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> year the pretended <HI>En|glish-mans
God,</HI> appeared to him again, as a|fore,
in the form of a Minister, requiring
him to kill himself, and promising him that
if he did obey, he should live again the next
day, and never die more. <HI>Squando</HI> acquain|ted
his Wife, and some other <HI>Indians</HI> with
this new Apparition, They most earnestly
advised him not to follow the murderous
Counsel which the <HI>Spectre</HI> had given. Ne|vertheless,
he since hath Hanged himself, and
so is gone to his own place. This was the
end of the Man that disturbed the Peace of
<HI>New-England.</HI></P>

<P>THere is lately come to my hand an ac|count
of some <HI>Remarkables,</HI> which
have hapned at <HI>Norwich</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI>
drawn up by Mr. <HI>Fitch,</HI> the Judicious and
eminently Faithful Pastor of the Church in
that place; which that others may be incou|raged
to follow his Example, in observing,
and recording the special Works of Divine
Providence, I shall here insert, as I received
it, and so hasten to finish this Essay. it is
that which follows.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Remarkable Providences at Norwich.</HEAD>
<P>1. Many times the Heavens have been
shut up but God hath answered our Prayers
<PB REF="198">
in sending Rain, and sometimes so speedily
and so plentifully after our seeking the Lord
by Fasting and Prayer, that the Heathen,
now for more than twenty years upon oc|casion
of want of Rain, will speak to us
to call upon the Name of the Lord our
God; one especial Instance of this kind I
have already given, and its upon Record, in
the History of the War with the <HI>Indians</HI> in
<HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>2. Many among us have been in more
than ordinary hazard by <HI>Rattle-Snakes,</HI> some
have set their feet upon them, some have
been bitten by them upon the skin, and
one as he was stooping down to drink at a
Spring of Water, spied a <HI>Rattle-Snake</HI> with|in
two foot of his head rising up against
him; thus manifold wayes in danger by
this Venimous Creature, and yet none of
us have suffered any harm, but only one was
bitten in the finger, and in a short time
perfectly healed.</P>
<P>3. In the time of the Wars with the <HI>In|dians,</HI>
we were not only preserved from the
<HI>Heathen</HI> in the midst of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> but by
the Lords making some of them to be a
Wall of Defence unto us. And thus we
<PB N="365" REF="198">
were saved by a Destroying means.</P>
<P>And at this time the Providence of God
was very remarkable in preserving many of
our People, in one of our Garrisons, who
were driven to Garrison several Houses, and
the House of which now I speak, did con|tain
about sixty persons; and in this House
one of the Souldiers taking a Gun Loaden
with Bullets into his hand, as he stood in a
lower Room, the Lock being half bent,
and he holding the Gun right upwards,
the Gun was Discharged, though many Peo|ple
were in the Chamber, yet none of them
suffered any harm, because Providence did
guid the Shot into the Summer, that piece
of Timber which is the support of the
Chamber.</P>
<P>Also one in the same House, looking
with a Candle under a Bed for something
he wanted, fired some Flax, which filled
the Room with Flame and Smoke, and
two small Children lay sleeping in this pe|ril,
but were preserved from the fire, or
any harm by the throng of People in the
Room, at length one of the Children was
taken up by one of the Men with a
purpose of throwing it out of the Chamber
<PB N="366" REF="199">
Window, but at that very moment thers was
such an abatement of the Flame, and hope
that the worst of the danger was past, that
he held the Child in his Arms; and yet
presently after the fire brake out again in
the uppermost Room in the House, nigh to
a Barrel of Gun-powder: but some were
guided, strengthened and succeeded in their
endeavour, to the extinguishing the fire; so
that the Lives, and Limbs, and Goods of all
these was preserved by the good hand of
God, who doth wonderfully when we know
not what to do.</P>
<P>4. One of the Children of the Church
grown up, (though not in full Communi|on)
was left to fall into a most notorious
abominable practice, which did occasion
the Church to meet and humble their Souls
by Fasting and Prayer, and at this time in
the Sermon and Prayer, It was Declared,
that the Lord had determined either to bring
our Children nearer to him, &amp; not to suffer
them to live out of full communion with his
Church, or else he would in his Anger leave
them to such Abominations as shall cut
them off from his Church; And since this
time, many young People have by the grace
of the Lord been prepared for full Commu|nion,
<PB N="367" REF="199">
and have taken hold of the Cove|nant,
confessing, that they have felt the im|pression
of that Word upon that abashing
occasion spoken: And thus the fall of one
hath been the rising of many. Where sin
abounds, the Lord can make Grace to su|perabound.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Concerning some Personal De|liverances.</HEAD>
<P>There was a Young-man endeavouring
to subdue a young Horse; and a Rope at
one end of it was fastned about the Horses
neck, but the Horse running with great
speed, the other end of the Rope caught
the Foot of this Young Man, as in a snare,
and was so entangled therein, that he was
drawn ten Rods upon his back in a very
rough and uneven place of Land, he being
utterly unable to free himself, and none at
hand that could help him; and thus it be|ing
come to this <HI>Extremity,</HI> the Horse of
himself stood still, so long, and no longer
time, than that the Young Man did clear
his foot out of the Rope; and thus was
Delivered out of the Danger, and suffered
not a broken Bone, nor any considerable
bruise or harm.
<PB N="368" REF="200">
there was another Young, Man, who sat
upon a plough-Beam, and suddenly his
Cattle moving his Plough turned, and one
of his Legs was entangled within the
Plough, and the Plough-Irons pressing hard
against some part of his Body, but could
not free himself; and the more he called
to the Cattle, the more speedily they mo|ved,
and thus was in danger of being torn
in pieces; but in this extremity it was not
long before the Cattle of themselves stood
still.</P>
<P>There was another Young Man, who
did fall about ten foot from some part of
the Mill Timber into deep Waters, and a
place of many Rocks, a Stream very vio|lent,
and he was carried about eleven Rod
down the Stream, where there was a great
piece of Ice, and while he was in this con|founded
and amazed Posture, his hand was
guided to take hold of that Ice, and there
to hold until one who saw him fall, did ad|venture
upon that Ice, and drew him out
of the Waters, and thus they were both de|livered.</P>
<P>There was a very aged Man among us,
who riding in his Cart over a River, and
when the Cattle were coming out of the
River, he endeavoured to come out of the
<PB N="369" REF="200">
Cart, but he did fall down so nigh to the
Wheel, that it began to press hard against
his Breast, and he only speaking to the
Cattle they stood still, and ceased moving
till he was removed out of the danger, o|therwise,
if they had moved a few Inches
more, he had been prest to death.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>Thus far is Mr. <HI>Fitch's</HI> Narrative. Had
all others been as diligent in observing the
Works of God, as this Worthy Person has,
the account of <HI>New-Englands Remarkabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI>
would have been more full and compleat.
But other things must be left for another at|tempt
of this kind. I shall only add at pre|sent,
That there have been many sudden
Deaths in this Countrey, which should not
pass without some Remark. For when such
Strokes are multiplied, there is undoubtedly a
speaking voice of Providence therein. And
so it hath been with us in <HI>New-England</HI> this
last year, and most of all the last Summer.
To my observation in <HI>August</HI> last, within the
space of three or four weeks, there were
twelve sudden Deaths (and it may be others
have observed more than I did) some of
them being in respect of sundry Circumstan|ces
exceeding awful. Let me only add here,
that sudden Death is not alwayes a Judgement
<PB N="370" REF="201">
unto those who are taken out of an evil
World: It may be a mercy to them, and a
warning unto others, as the sudden Death of
the Prophet <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Wife was. Many of
whom the World was not worthy, have been
so removed out of it. <HI>Moses</HI> died suddenly.
And so have some excellent persons in this
Countrey done. Governour <HI>Eaton</HI> at <HI>New-Haven,</HI>
and Governour <HI>Haines</HI> at <HI>Hartford</HI>
Died in their sleep without being sick. That
Excellent Man of God Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> as he
was walking in his House in this <HI>Boston,</HI> was
taken with a <HI>Syncope,</HI> fell down Dead and ne|ver
spake more. The like has hapned to o|ther
Servants of God in other parts of the
World. Famous Mr. <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nes,</HI> on a Lords Day
after he had Preached and Administred the
Sacrament, went to Bed well, and went to
Heaven that night. Nor is there any rule or
reason for Christians to pray absolutely a|gainst
sudden Death. Some Holy Men
have with submission to the Will of the most
High, desired and prayed for such a Death.
So did Mr. <HI>Capel,</HI> and God gave him his de|sire;
for on <HI>September</HI> 21. 1656. having Prea|ched
twice that Day, and performed Reli|gious
Duties with his Family, he went to Bed
and Died immediately. The like is reported
by Dr. <HI>Euller,</HI> in his Church History, con|cerning
<PB N="371" REF="201">
that <HI>Angelical Man</HI> Mr. <HI>Brightman,</HI>
who would often pray, (if God saw fit) that
he might die rather a sudden than a lingring
Death, and so it came to pass. For as he
was Travelling in the Coach with Sr. <HI>Iohn
Osborne,</HI> and reading of a Book (for he would
lose no time) he was taken with a Fainting
Fit, and though instantly taken out in the
Arms of one there present, and all means
possible used for his Recovery, he there Died,
<HI>August</HI> 24. 1607. The Learned &amp; Pious <HI>Wolfius</HI>
(not the Divine who has written Commen|taries
on several parts of the Scriptures;
but he that published <HI>Lectionum Memorabi|lium
&amp; Reconditarum Centenarios)</HI> On <HI>May</HI>
23. 1600. being in usual Health, was, after
he had Dined, surprised with a sudden ill|ness,
whereof he Died within a few hours.
That Holy Man <HI>Iacobus Faber,</HI> who did and
suffered great things for the Name of Christ,
went suddenly into the silent Grave: On a
Day when some Friends came to visit him,
after he had courteously entertained them,
he laid himself down upon his Bed to take
some Repose; and no sooner shut his Eyes,
but his Heaven-born Soul took its flight into
the World of Souls.</P>
<P>The Man who being in Christ, shall al|wayes
be doing something for God, may
<PB N="372" REF="202">
bid Death welcome when ever it shall come,
be it never so soon, never so suddenly.</P>
