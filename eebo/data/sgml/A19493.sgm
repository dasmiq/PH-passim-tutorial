vs, as it were with the wings of an Eagle. And the Lord hath

and to seeke in this Apothecarie shop of that sweet <HI>Sama|ritan</HI>

<P>Among all the bookes of the old Testament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why among the Epistles this to the Ro|manes is first.</NOTE> most fre|quent
testimonies are brought by our blessed Sauiour and
his holy Apostles, out of the booke of the Psalmes. <HI>Ierome</HI>
called it a treasurie of all learning: And among all the
Epistles of the Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierom. epist. ad Paulin.</NOTE> no meruaile this to the Romanes
haue the first place, not that it was first written, but because
aboue the rest, it contayneth a most perfect compend of our
Christian faith. And this middle Chapter thereof hath in
it an Abridgement of all these comforts and instructions,
(one excepted) which otherwise are dispersed throughout
the whole Epistle, and is (so to call it) a pleasant k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ot of
the garden, and Paradise of God, and therefore shall it not
be vnprofitable for vs, by Gods grace to delight our selues
for a while in it.</P>
<P>As to the connexion of this Chapter with the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two parts of this Chapter, the first con|taines comfort against sinne: The second, comfortagainst the crosse.</NOTE>
wee are to know that it is a conclusion of the foregoing
treatise of Iustification. Wherein the Apostle summarilie
collects the excellent state of a Christian, iustified by faith
in Christ Iesus, declaring it to bee such, that there is no con|demnation
to him, that nothing, were it neuer so euill is
able to hurt him, yea by the contrary, that all things workes
for the best vnto him. And because there are onely two
<PB N="3" REF="4">
euils which grieue vs in this life, to wit, sinne that remaines
in vs: and affliction that followes vs in the following of
Christ. Against both these the Apostle furnishes the iusti|fied
man, with strong consolations. Comforts against the
remanents of sinne, wee haue from the 1. verse to the 18.
Comforts against our afflictions, wee haue from the midst
of the 18. verse, to the 31.</P>
<P>That this is the very purpose and order of the Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This order of the Apostle is manifest out of his owne con|clusion.</NOTE>
is euident out of his owne conclusion, set downe from the
31. verse, to the end: wherein hee drawes all that hee hath
spoken in this Chapter to a short summe, contayning the
glorious triumph of a Christian ouer all his enimies. The
triumph is first set downe generally, verse 31.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 31.</NOTE> <HI>What shall
wee then say to these things, if God bee with vs, who can bee
against vs, &amp;c.</HI> This generall incontinent hee parts in two,
there is (sayeth hee) but two things may hurt vs, either
Sinne, or Affliction. As to Sinne, hee triumphs against it,
verse 33. and 34.<NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 33. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God
his chosen? it is God that iustifieth, who shall condemne? It is
Christ, who is dead, or rather, who is risen againe, who is also
at the right hand of God, and maketh request for vs.</HI> As to
Affliction, hee triumphs against it, from the 35. to the end,
<HI>Who shall seperate vs from the loue of Christ? shall tribulation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 35.</NOTE>
<HI>anguish, or persecution? shall famine, nakednesse, or perill?</HI> yea
<HI>shall death</HI> doe it? or that which is much more, shall <HI>An|gels,
principalities, or powers</HI> doe it? No, <HI>In all these things
wee are more than Conquerours, through him that loued vs.</HI>
Thus doth the Apostle like a faithfull steward in the house
of God, take by the hand the weary sonnes and daughters
of the liuing God, that hee may leade vs into the Lords
winesellers, there to refresh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 2. 4.</NOTE> and <HI>stay vs with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lagons of
his Wine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 5. 1.</NOTE> <HI>to comfort vs with his Apples, to strengthen vs with
his hid Manna, and to make vs merry with that Milke and
Hony</HI> which our immortall husband Iesus Christ, hath pro|uided
for vs, to sustaine vs, that we faint not through our ma|nifold
tentations that compasse vs in this barren wildernes.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
We come then to the first part of the Chapter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subdiuision of the first part.</NOTE> where|in
the Apostle keepes this order. First, hee sets downe a
generall proposition of comfort belonging to the iustified
man. Secondly, he subioynes a confirmation therof. Third|ly,
he explanes his reason of confirmation, and fourthly, ap|plyes
i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">first by commination of them who walke after the
flesh, secondly, by consolation of the godly against the re|manents
of the flesh, thirdly, by exhortation of both not to
walke after the flesh. In the proposition againe set downe,
<MILESTONE N="1"> Verse 1.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proposition.</NOTE> first, he points at the comfort; <HI>Now then there is no
condemnation:</HI> secondly, he sets downe a limitation, restray|ning
this comfort; <HI>To them who are in Christ:</HI> thirdly, hee
subioynes a clearer declaration of those persons who are in
Christ, to wit, <HI>they walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Verse 1.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coherence of this Chapter with the for|mer.</NOTE> <HI>Now then.</HI> This is a relatiue to his former dis|course,
and is (as I haue said) a Conclusion inferred vpon
that which goeth before. Seeing wee are iustified by Faith
in Iesus Christ, and are now no more vnder the Law, but
vnder Grace; seeing we are buryed with Christ by Baptisme
into his death, that like as he was raised from the dead by
the glory of his Father, so we also should walke in new|nesse
of life, hauing receiued that spirit of Christ, whereby
wee fight against the Law of sinne in our members, which
rebelleth against the Law of our minde: seeing it is so, we
may be sure that the remanent power of sinne in vs, shall
neuer be able to condemne vs.</P>
<P>We see then that these words containe the Apostles glo|rying
against the remanents of sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apostles former lamen|tation turned into a triumph.</NOTE> the sense whereof,
in the end of the last Chapter made him burst out in a pit|tifull
lamentation, and cry; <HI>O miserable man, who will deliuer
me from the body of this death,</HI> but now considering the cer|taintie
of his deliuerance by Iesus Christ, he reioyceth and
triumpheth. Wherein for our first lesson, we marke the di|uersitie
of dispositions, to which the Children of God are
subiect in this life, sometime so full of comfort that they can
not containe themselues, but must needs breake forth into
<PB N="5" REF="5">
glorious reioycings: at other times so far deiected in mind,
that their ioy is turned into mourning; and this ariseth in
them from the variable change of their sight and feeling.
The Disciples on mount Tabor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 17. 2.</NOTE> seeing the bright shining
glorie of Christ were rauished with ioy, but incontinent
when the cloud ouershadowes them, they become afraid.
If the Lord let vs feele his mercies, wee are aliue, but if hee
hide his face,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 50. 21.</NOTE> <HI>and set our sinnes in order before vs,</HI> wee are
sore troubled.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The life of a Christian is a mixed webbe, wrought of trouble and comfort.</NOTE> As the troubles wee haue in this life are not
without comforts; <HI>blessed bee God the Father of our Lord

for here we are so nourished with the comforts of
God, that we are nurtred with his crosses. It is the Lords

the peace and ioy which once the Lord hath giuen vs, may
be interrupted, but can neuer vtterly be taken from vs, the

The life of a Christian may bee compared to a webbe, so
<PB N="6" REF="6">
meruailously mixed and wouen of comfort and trouble, by
the hand of God, that the long thread thereof reaching
from the day of our birth to the day of our death, are all of
trouble, but the weft interiected, manifold comforts, and
this haue we marked vpon the coherenee of the beginning
of this Chapter, with the end of the former.</P>
<P>Now in these words it is to be obserued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Papist wrong|fully collect here, that there is sin on, or damnable act in them who are in Christ.</NOTE> the Apostle saies
not, there is no sinne in them who are in Christ, but he saith,
there is no condemnation to them: he hath confessed before
that he did the euill which he would not, and that he saw a
law in his members rebelling against the law of his minde,
but now hee reioyceth in Christ, that sinne in him is not
able to condemne him. It is then a false exposition of these
words, which is made by <HI>Caietane</HI> and <HI>Aquinas: Nihil est
damnabile in illis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquinas, Caietane on this place.</NOTE> <HI>qui sunt in Christo, nullus actus quo merea|mur
damnari,</HI> that in them who are is Christ, there is no|thing
worthy to be damned, no act that merits damnation:
for the Apostle condemnes these motions of sinne, which
he found in himselfe, as euill and repugnant to the Law of
God: and if the holy Apostle was not ashamed to confesse
this of himselfe, what blinde presumption is this in them,
to exempt themselues, or others from such motions, as are
worthy to be damned, wee shall still confesse our guiltines,
there remaines in vs of our owne which the Lord might
condemne, if he would enter into iudgement with vs, and
shall so much the more praise his mercie, who hath deliue|red
vs from condemnation: and further comfort then this
the Apostles words do not afford vnto vs, <GAP DESC="foreign">.
There is no iudgement, no sentence to be giuen against
them who are in Chrst. Surely our righteousnesse in this
life, consists rather in the remission of sinnes, then in the
perfection of vertue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cypriain orat. dom.</NOTE> <HI>Ne quis sibi, quasi innocens placeat, cum
innocens nemo sit, &amp; se extollendo plus pereat, instruitur &amp; do|cetur,

and so by extolling himselfe, should perish so much the
more, he is instructed and taught that he sinnes, while as
euery day hee is commaunded to pray for remission of
sins, but this errour we shall God willing further improue
hereafter.</P>
<P>In the meane time for our comfort let vs consider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why the Lord suf|fers sin to re|maine in the iustified man.</NOTE> that
albeit the Lord, when hee iustified vs, might haue vtterly
destroyed the life of this sinning sinne in vs, yet for waigh|ty
causes hath he suffered some life thereof to abide in vs
for a time:<NOTE PLACE="marg">For the exercise of our Faith.</NOTE> the first is, for the exercise of our faith, <HI>Peccata <MILESTONE N="1">
quorum reatum Soluit Deus, ne post hanc vitam obsint, ma|nere
tamen voluit ad certamen fidei;</HI> these sinnes (saith <HI>Au|gustine</HI>)
the guiltinesse whereof God hath loosed, that they
should not hurt vs in the life to come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in Ioan. tract. 41.</NOTE> hee will haue to re|maine
for the exercise of our faith. <HI>No man is crowned, ex|cept
he striue as he ought,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. 2. 5.</NOTE> and therefore the Lord who hath
prepared for vs a crowne, and hath put vpon vs his com|pleat
armour, hath also suffered some enimies to remaine,
against whom we may fight, for the tryall of our faith, pa|tience
and perseuerance, euen as the Cananites were left in
the Land, that the Lord by them might proue the Israe|lits,
whether if or not, they would keepe the way of the Lord
to walke into it.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For our instru|ction that we may know what benefite we haue by Christ.</NOTE> some life of sinne is left in vs for our instru|ction,<MILESTONE N="2">
that wee may know the better how farre we are ob|lieged
to Gods mercy, and how excellent is that deliuerance
which we haue by Iesus Christ. <HI>Nulla quidem est condem|natio

recurramus.</HI> It is true indeed (saith <HI>Bernard</HI>) that there
is no condemnation to them who are in Christ, yet for our
humiliation the Lord suffers sinne to liue in vs, and often|times
afflict vs, that we may know the benefit wee haue by
Grace, and make our recourse for helpe vnto it continually,
and indeed, except by experience wee felt how powerfull
<PB N="8" REF="7">
sin is of it selfe to ouer rule vs, we could neuer haue knowne
that vile bondage and seruitude of sinne, vnder which wee
lay by nature, nor that excellent Grace of Christ, by which
we haue gotten deliuerance. And therefore so oft as wee
are troubled with our inhabitant corruption, we are to con|sider,
that if the remanents of the old man breed vs such
strong and restlesse tentations, how would it tyrannize o|uer
vs, if it were liuing in the full vigour, &amp; strength thereof?
that so we may praise and magnifie that sauing Grace of
the Lord Iesus, which hath freed vs from so intollerable a
tyrannie.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For the greater glory of God, and Sathans greater confu|sion.</NOTE> the Lord hath done this for his own greater glo|ry,
like vnto those Victors in battaile, who albeit they may,
yet will not put all their enimies to the edge of the sword,
some of them they take Captiues, and reserues for a while
aliue against the day of triumph, to be put then to death, to
their greater shame, and the greater honour of their Con|querours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 10. 23.</NOTE>
When <HI>Ioshua</HI> had discomfited those fiue Kings,
who made warre against Gibeon, hee would not slay them
in the battaile, but inclosed them in a caue, that the battell
being ended, he might put them to death in sight of all his
people: and then for their further confirmation, hee caused
his Captaines and chiefe men of warre, to tread vpon the
necks of these Kings, to assure them that after the same man|ner
the Lord should subdue all the rest of their enimies vn|der
them. And so our Captaine &amp; mightie conquerour, the
Lord Iesus, hath by himselfe obtained vnto vs victorie ouer
all our enimies, these Kings which besieged Gibeon are
turned to flight, these inordinate affections, which held vs
Captiues before, are now by his power captiued of vs, they
are closed vp vvithin vs (as in a Caue) vvhere they remaine
vvith some life, but restrained of their former libertie and
power. And vve rest assured, that when the battaile shall be
finished, our Lord Iesus shall altogether spoyle them of
their life:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 16. 20</NOTE> <HI>The God of peace shall shortly tread Sathan vnder
our feete:</HI> then <HI>Goliah</HI> being ouercome, his army of the
<PB N="9" REF="7">
Philistines shall flie, and no inordinate desire shall bee left
within vs. Thus wee see how the Lord permits his enimie
to liue, and will not (fully) torment him before the time, it is
not because he wants power to subdue him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciril. catech. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Set vt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o ma|gis

him. When as all the warriours of God, aswell those who
are to come in the last age of the world, as those who were
in the forefront of the battaile, haue foughten against
him, and ouercome him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 15. 25</NOTE> then shall the Lord Iesus put all
his enimies vnder his feete. Yea, euen now in the very time
of the conflict is Sathan wonderfully confounded in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Sathan is daily confoun|ded in the godly.</NOTE>
that notwithstanding the Serpent keepe his sting, yet there
is no deadly power in it. This vncircumcised <HI>Goliah</HI> hath
that same sword in his hand, by which he hath slaine many
one, the Lord permits him also to strike the Christian man
therewith, but hee sees himselfe it is in vaine. O how doth
he returne ashamed and confounded, when hauing gotten
leaue to shoot out his sting, and to strike with his accusto|med
sword (of sinne) those whom he hateth vnto death, he

but that forcible working liuely power vvhich is in Christ:
for it is customable to the holy Apostle to vse the vvord
<HI>law</HI> to expresse any thing, wherein there is a commanding
or working power; so hee hath ascribed a law to sinne, a
law to his members, a law to death, and now very pro|perly
hee oppones vnto them <HI>a law of the spirit of life in
Christ,</HI> vvhich is more liuely and powerfull to saue, to free,
and to quicken, then any law that hath contrary power, can
be able to destroy, captiue, or slay them who are in Christ.</P>
<P>Thus the words being expounded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our aduersa|ries Sathan, sinne &amp; death, are strong, but our Sauiour is stronger.</NOTE> the first lesson will a|rise

contrary power of man and Angell in subiecton to him,

hath a mightie power able to disanull the lavv of sinne: and
Sathan is that strong one vvho by nature possesses the hart
of man, as his owne house, but Iesus is that stronger one,
vvho vvill dispossesse him and cast him out of the hearts of

<P>This being spoken of the bondage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our deliue|rance from this bondage is to be ascribed vn|to Christ only.</NOTE> vve are now to con|sider

who hath eyes to see what an vniuersall rebellion of na|ture
there is in man vnregenerate to Gods holy law, yea
what imperfections and discordance with the law are re|manent

which the good and holy law of God requires, but also vve
become worse by the law: for by the commandements of

hee found this in his own person;<NOTE PLACE="marg">August. lib. 2 confess. cap. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine</HI> also examining
his former sinfull life, doth hereby aggrauate his corruption,
that in his young yeeres hee vvas accustomed to steale his

had better at home, as for a sinfull delight he had to goe with
his companions to commit euill: so that where the lavv

<P><HI>God sending his owne Sonne.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Christ hath done that which the law could not.</NOTE> The Apostle proceedes and
let vs see how the Lord by Christ hath wrought that sal|uation
which the Law could not. Wherein first it is to bee
marked, that the Apostle saith not wee sought from the
Lord a Sauiour, but that the Lord sent him vnto vs vnre|quired.
Surely neither man nor Angell could haue euer
thought of such a way of Saluation, the Lord hath found
it out himselfe, in his incomprehensible wisedome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> a way so
to saue man, that the glory both of his mercie and iustice
shall bee saued also. Most properly therefore is hee called,
<HI>Pater non indiciorum, sed misericordiarum,</HI> Father not of

meanes of our saluation are from himselfe: hee hath found
causes without him, mouing to execute his iustice, hee hath
beene prouoked thereunto by the disobedience of apostate
Angels, and man; but a cause mouing him to shew mercie
is within himselfe, this praise is due to God, it is the grea|test
glory, that can bee giuen vnto him. Abhominable
therefore is that errour of fore-seene merites by which
the aduersaryes doe what they can to obscure the praise of
the bright shining glory of Gods mercie.</P>
<P><HI>His owne Sonne.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Christ is Gods owne son</NOTE> Iesus Christ is called Gods owne
Sonne, to distinguish him from all others who are his sonnes
by adoption, onely Christ is the Sonne of God by nature,

<HI>Who can expresse it.</HI> Thus is hee Gods owne sonne, that is,
coeternall and coessentiall, begotten of the Father before

<P>The last of these two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christs diuine generation a great mysterie.</NOTE> the Apostle makes the first point
of the <HI>misterie of Godlinesse. God manifested in the flesh,</HI> where|in
he bridles our curiositie, for if his manifestation in the

Arrians seeking to search out this vnsearchable mysterie
with naturall reason, by infinite degrees more foolish then
if they had presumed to number the starres of heauen, or
measure with their fist all the vvaters in the Sea, they stum|bled
and fell, being neuer able to comprehend, how the son
that was begotten should bee coeternall and coessentiall to
the Father who begot him: therefore the worthy Fathers
of the primitiue Church to expresse the presumption of
these arrogant spirits, drew them down from the dangerous
speculation of these high mysteries far aboue their capa|citie,
to consideration of things which are in nature. <HI>Si in

loue shewed vs, wee shall still refuse to bee his seruants:
much will be required of him, to whom much is giuen, those
Gentiles to whom the Lord reuealed himselfe in goodnes
onely as their Creator, because they did not glorifie him,
the Apostle saith that the wrath of God was reuealed from
heauen vpon them, and what wrath then maist thou looke
for, to whom the Lord hath manifested himselfe in mercy
also, as thy Redeemer in Christ, and yet thou wilt not glo|rifie
him: thou receiuest not him whom thy Father hath
sent vnto thee, neyther wilt thou liue vnto him, that gaue
himselfe to dye for thee, but by thy wicked life thou cruci|fiest
againe the Sonne of God, and treadest vnder thy feet
the bloud of the new couenant: certainely Sodome and
Gomorrha shall be in an easier estate in the day of iudge|ment,
then the wicked of this generation. For in this last
age the Lord hath spoken to vs by his Son, he hath none
greater to send after him: those labourers of the vineyard
that slew the Seruants of the great King, were not for
that instantly punished, but when the Sonne came, and they
had murthered him also, then was their iudgement no lon|ger
delayed. It was not written for the Iewes onely in whom
it was first accomplished, but for vs also to whom the Fa|ther
in this last age hath sent his owne Sonne, and by
whom hee hath spoken vnto vs from himselfe, if we despise
him there remaines no more but a violent looking for of
iudgement.</P>
<P>The third dutie is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Loue to those whom he hath bidden loue for his sake.</NOTE> that for Christs sake wee loue vnfai|nedly
those vvhom hee hath recommended vnto vs, our

little weake and impotent children, of vvhom he hath said,
what yee doe to one of these little ones for my sake is done
to mee, and let vs shew kindnesse vnto them, for the great
loue which the Lord Iesus hath shewed vnto vs.</P>
<P><HI>And that for sinne.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ came to destroy sinne, cursed are they who nourish it.</NOTE> These wordes containe the end of
Christs manifestation in the flesh, which is, that in our na|ture
hee might beare the punishment of our sinnes, satisfie
the iustice of God, and so abolish sinne. Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> makes
this cleare, when he saith, that hee appeared to destroy the
workes of the diuell, that is, sinne: for sinne being remoued
there is nothing in man, but the workmanship of God. By
this it is euident how highly they offend God, who abuseth
the death of Christ, to nourish themselues in their sinne,
being the bolder to commit sinne, because Christ dyed for
them: surely this is to turne the grace of God into wanton|nesse.
The Lord came to abolish sinne, not to nourish it,
<HI>Christ once suffered,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 3. 18.</NOTE> <HI>the iust for the vniust</HI> (not that we should

therefore who continuest vniust, maist say, as thou hast

not say in truth, that there is a Sauiour come to thee. For
where Christ comes hee worketh that worke for which hee
came, namely, hee destroyes the worke of the diuell, that is
hee enfeebles, and abolishes at the last the power of sinne.</P>
<P><HI>Condemned sinne.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Christ hath condem|ned sinne.</NOTE> Sinne by a metaphor is said to be con|demned,

no more any place to appeare in iudgement, so hath the
Lord Iesus disanulled sinne, that it hath now no power to

vvhich the law required to bee inflicted on man

<P>For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two head or chiefe iustice Courts holden by God.</NOTE> this word of Condemnation imports a iust, and lawful

that themselues may be absolued; in the second the
persons of all the reprobate shall bee iusty condemned. In
the first by the ordinance of God the Father, our sinnes
were laid vpon the back of Iesus Christ, and a law imposed
to him which was neuer giuen to any other, neyther An|gell
or man, to wit, the law of a Mediator, that hee should
make vp peace betweene God and man; loue God in such
sort, that hee should by suffering preserue the glory of his
Fathers iustice, and yet make manifest the glory of his mer|cy;
that hee should loue his brethren in such sort, that hee
should take the burden of their transgressions vpon him,
which as by the Father it vvas inioyned vnto him, so did hee
vvillingly vndertake it. And therefore hauing our sinnes
imputed vnto him, hee presented himselfe for vs vpon the
Crosse, as vpon a pannell before the Iudge, to vnderly the

<P>_THe Apostle hauing taught vs in the former verse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Here followes the second member of the explication, wherein hee shewes how we are deliue|red from the commanding power of sin.</NOTE><MILESTONE N="2">
how the Lord Iesus hath freed vs from the con|demning
power of sinne, doth now let vs see how
we are freed also from the commanding power of
sinne; for hee sets downe this to bee the first, and neerest end
of Christs death in respect of vs, the renouation of our na|ture,
and conformitie thereof with God his holy law: which
hee expresses more cleerely in another place, when he saith,
<HI>that Christ gaue himselfe to the death for his Church,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. 5. 26.</NOTE> <HI>that hee
might sanctifie it, and make it to himselfe a glorious Church,

frustrate, as hee hath begunne it, so he shall finish it, he shall
conforme vs to the law, the righteousnesse thereof shall be
fulfilled in vs, there shall not bee left in our nature so much
as a sinfull motion or desire, but hee shall at the last present

<P>This righteousnesse of the law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the righ|teousnesse of the law is ful|filled in vs.</NOTE> I vnderstand to be that
perfect obedience to the Commaundements thereof, which
the law requires flowing from the perfect loue of God and

first by application or imputation of Christs righteousnesse
vnto vs, he is our head and we his members, and are so vnited
with him, that now we are not to be taken as sundry but as
one bodie with him. By vertue of the which communion it
comes to passe, that that which is ours is his, and that which
is his, is ours, so that in our head we haue fulfilled the law,
satisfied Gods iustice for our sinnes. Secondly, it will be ful|filled
in vs by our perfect sanctification, though now wee

and that in Christian men that is fulfilled by Christs grace,
which by the force of the Law could neuer be fulfilled:</HI> that the

that is, perfect in regard of his intention and purpose,
not in regard of peruention, and obtayning of his purpose.
And hereunto agrees that of <HI>Bernard,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ber. in Cant. serm. 49.</NOTE> <HI>Magnum illud electi|onis

that which is required of them, that is, sometimes he pray|ses
them for the good they haue done, and otherwhiles he

<P>And as for that place of Saint <HI>Luke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Zacharie and Elizabeth walked in all the commande+ments of God.</NOTE> where it is said that
<HI>Zacharie</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> walked without reproofe in all the
Commandements of God because the Iesuits of Rhemes in
their obseruations would wrest it to confirme their errour,
we will shortly make it manifest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 1. 6.</NOTE> That it makes not for
them, <HI>Augustine</HI> hath two reasons, whereby hee proues out
of that same Scripture, that <HI>Zacharie</HI> was not without sinne,
first because he was a Priest, and was bound to offer aswell
for his owne sins, as the sins of the people. Secondly, in that
the Euangelist saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 5. 3.</NOTE> hee walked in the commandements of
God, it is an agreement, that as yet hee had not attayned
to the marke: to the which wee may adde the third out of
that same place, the dombnesse inflicted vpon him for his
misbeleeuing, euidently proues he was not so perfect as to
bee without sinne. Beside this, he customably distinguishes
betweene <HI>peccatum &amp; crimen,</HI> sinne and a crime, that is,
<PB N="80" REF="34">
some grieuous offence that giues slaunder and is worthie of

he can liue without sinne, doth not thereby make himselfe
free of sinne, but debarres himselfe from the pardon of his

<P>Now for our instruction we marke againe here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of Christs death is our sanctifi|cation, there|fore it should not be abused to giue libertie to sinne.</NOTE> that see|ing
the end of Christs death is our sanctification, it cannot
be but a mocking of the sonne of God, and a treading of
his holy blood, vnder the vncleane feete of men, to make
the death of Christ a nourishment of sin: let such thoughts
bee farre from vs, that we should take liberty to sinne, be|cause
we haue a Sauiour? this is to make Christ a minister
of sinne, and as was said, to build vp that which Christ came
to destroy. O thou who louest the Lord Iesus, bee it far from
thee to take pleasure in that which made his blessed soule
heauie vnto death, let vs neuer nourish that life of sin, which
was the cause of the death of Christ, but let vs daily <HI>cleanse

In respect of the one, the Apostle said, <HI>Wee are not vnder

said that the Law is good: and our Sauiour protests he came
not to destroy the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. 15.</NOTE> but to fulfill it, both in himselfe

the reason of confirmation and explicati|on
thereof. Now because the Apostle restray|ned
that comfort to those <HI>who walkes after the
spirit, not after the flesh:</HI> now in this third member of the
first part of the Chapter, hee subioynes an exhortation.
Wherein by sundry reasons he disswades vs for walking af|ter
the flesh, and exhorts vs to walke after the spirit: where|in
he keepes this order. First he oppones these two, <HI>to walke
after the flesh, and after the spirit,</HI> as contraries, which can|not
consist. He lets vs see the miserable estate of them who
walke after the one, and illustrates it by the happy estate of
those who walke after the other, and then concludes that
they who are in the flesh cannot please God, vers. 5. 6. 7. 8.
Secondly he comforts the godly, least that they considering

and like a Serpent creeping on many feet, so walketh it af|ter

things which are carnall. This is mans miserable estate by
nature. The Lord open our eyes, that wee may see how
farre wee are fallen by our apostacie, how deadly wee are
wounded, that in time wee may make our recourse to the

<P>But to returne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diuers dis|position of the Christian and carnall man flowes from the diuersitie of their generati|ons.</NOTE> this diuersitie of dispositions in the man
naturall and spirituall, the Apostle designes to flow from
the diuersitie of their generations, <HI>they who are after the flesh,</HI>
that is as our Sauiour expounds it, <HI>that which is borne of the
flesh, is flesh:</HI> so then the cause why they are carnall and sa|uours
onely the things of the flesh, is because they are onely
pertakers of a carnall generation. Euery creature, as ye may
see,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 3. 6.</NOTE> hath an inclination to follow the owne kind, some liues
in the earth, some in the water, euery one of them by in|stinct
of that nature, which they receiued in their generation,
following so earnestly their owne kinde, that a contrarie
education cannot make them to forsake it. The Fowle
whose kinde is to liue in the waters, though she be brought
vp vnder the wings of another damme, whose kinde is to
liue in the earth, so soone, as shee is strengthened with fea|thers,
forsaking her education, followes her kinde: so also
in euery man the disposition of his affections and actions is
answerable to the nature of his life. If he haue no more but
a naturall life, his cogitations, counsels, resolutions, and acti|ons
are onely carnall, but if he haue also a spirituall life, then
shall he be able to mount aboue nature, hauing an inclina|tion
to heauenly things, for euery one who is risen with Ie|sus,
seekes those things which are aboue.</P>
<P>Now this difference of ther dispositions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The contrary disposition of the christian &amp; carnall man appeares.</NOTE> flowing from

In this verse the comfort is first set downe, and then a caution

the Caution for the presumptuous professor: the A|postle
so terrifies the vvicked, that he reserues comfort for

not the wicked in their sinnes. No sort of men are sooner
moued with the sharpe speaches of the word of God, then

write vnto a Church and a publique fellowship or com|pany
of men, <HI>seperate</HI> from the remanent of the world <HI>by
the heauenly vocation, called to be Saints,</HI> and therefore might
vndoubtedly write vnto them as vnto Saints, and spirituall

a number that belong to the election of grace.</P>
<P>But to proceed further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A threefold iudgement, first of our selues by faith, secondly by fruits, third|ly by reuelatio~</NOTE> and to see how farre vve may goe

extraordinary reuelation.</P>
<P>Againe wee haue to mrke for our comfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort that the Lord cals them spirituall in whom re|mained carnall corruption.</NOTE> how the

vpon this middest, that the spirit of God where hee dwels,
is not idle but workes; where he workes, he workes not in
vaine, but effectuates that which he intends, he transforms
them, in whom he dwels into the similitude of his owne I|mage,
hee is compared to fire that giues light euen to them
who are farre of, and heate to them who are neere hand,
but transchangeth those things into the nature of fire, which
are cast into it, with so meruailous a vertue, that yron which
is cold by nature being put into the fire becomes hot and
burning: so doth that holy Spirit illuminate euery one who
comes into the world, but hee changeth all those in whom

<HI>Ismael</HI> the sonne of the bond woman borne after the flesh,
is older and stronger then <HI>Isaac,</HI> the sonne of the freewo|man
borne after the spirit, that is, according to the promise;
hee disdaines little <HI>Isaac</HI> as weaker, and persecutes him, yet
the comfort of <HI>Isaac</HI> is, that though <HI>Ismaell</HI> dwell in the
house of <HI>Abraham</HI> for a while, hee shall not remaine: the
sonne of the bondwoman shall be cast out, and shall not
inherit the promise with the sonne of the free woman: such
a house is the soule of a Christian, there dwelleth in it at one
time both old nature and new grace, with their children, <HI>the
old man</HI> at the first being older and stronger than the <HI>new
man,</HI> doth persecute him, and seekes by all meanes to op|presse
him, but at the last hee shall be cast out.</P>
<P>This metaphor of <HI>dwelling,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meruailous that the inhabi|ter is larger tha~ the habitation.</NOTE> doth also yeelde vnto vs ex|ceeding
great comfort: in all other habitations the lodging
is larger than the inhabiter, but this is maruailous that the

maiestie, vvhom the heauen of heauens cannot contain,
vvho hath the heauen for his throne, and the earth for his

the soule of him that is poore, contrite, and trembles at his

hee sits as a Iudge, and is a terrour: which manner of way
<PB N="108" REF="44">
the damned are continually vexed with his presence, but in

<P>But of many we will shortly touch these two onely:<NOTE PLACE="marg">He repaires the whole lodging of soule and body.</NOTE> the <MILESTONE N="1">

and it extends both to soule and body: as to the
soule, the Lord strikes vp nevv lights in the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">do, restores
life to the heart, communicates holinesse to the affections,
so that where before the soule was a habitation for vncleane

the Dragons crying within her pallaces, that is, defiled with
all sorts of vile and vncleane affections, the Lord Iesus hath
sanctified it, to be a holy habitation vnto himselfe. And as
to the reparation of our bodies, it consists partly in making
all the members thereof weapons of righteousnesse in this
life, and partly in deliuerance of them from mortalitie and
corruptibilitie, which shall be done in the day of resurrecti|on;
which for the same cause is called by our Sauiour the
day of regeneration, for then shall hee change our mortall
bodies, and make them like vnto his owne glorious body:

our soules and bodies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He prouides all necessaries where hee dwels.</NOTE><MILESTONE N="2"></P>

<P>On the other extremitie are they who thinke they haue

come to the house of God, they bow their heads like a

this he proceeds and leads them to a sight of Gods mercie
in Christ, hee inflames their harts with a hunger &amp; thirst
for that mercie, and workes in their hearts such a loue of
righteousnesse, and hatred of sinne, that now they become
more afraid of the occasions of sinne, then they were before
of sinne it selfe: this resistance made to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">entations, this
care to eschew the occasions of sinne, is an vndoubted token
of the spirit of Christ dwelling in thee.</P>
<P>This is the first operation of the spirit, but it is not all,
he proceeds yet further by degrees: for the kingdom of God
is as if a man should cast seede into the earth, which growes

hee shall not faile at the last to be thy comforter: If at the

his consolation descending vpon thee, be not discouraged,

but if Christ be in you, the spirit through his righteousnesse
is endued with life: yee are not therefore to conclude, that
yee are carnall because death through sinne is entred into

this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death whereunto we are subiect is neither tot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll nor perpetuall.</NOTE> the death whereunto you are subiect, is neyther totall

part, which is his soule, it is pertaker of a life that is not sub|iect
vnto death. That it is not perpetuall he declares in the

<P>Now to the comfort:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The comfort of Ethnikes a|gainst death, not compara|ble to ours, and our courage in|ferior to theirs.</NOTE> wee haue by Iesus Christ a three|fold
comfort against death, whereof two onely here are
touched. The first that the death whereunto we are subiect
is not totall. The second, that the nature and qualitie of our
bodilie death is changed. The third that it is not perpetuall,
the body shall not for euer lie vnder death. The Ethnicks
had also their owne silly comforts, but nothing comparable
to ours. <HI>Nazianzen</HI> records that <HI>Cleopatra</HI> Queene of Ae|gypt,
demaunding of certaine learned men, what kinde of
death was without the bitter sense of paine, receiued this an|swere:
there is no death without dolour, but that death was
most gentle which was brought on by the Serpent Aspis,
and namely that kinde thereof which is called Aypnale, be|cause
they whose flesh is enuenomed with the poyson ther|of,
doe incontinently sleepe vnto death: for which cause also
shee made choyse of it. And <HI>Sene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI> being by <HI>Nero</HI> to bee
executed to death, got it left to his owne pleasure, (as
great fauour shewed vnto him) to make choyse of any death
hee pleased, he chose to bleede to death in hote water: others
among them that offered themselues to most fearefull
deaths, such as <HI>Curtius, Regulus,</HI> and others had no comfort
to sustaine them, but a silly hope of immortall fame of their
affection to their country. It was (saith <HI>Augustine</HI>) the silly
comfort of the Gentiles against the want of buriall, <HI>Coelo
tegitur, qui non habet vrnam,</HI> and as comfortlesse is the com|fort
of many bastard Christians, which stands onely in a
fayre Sepulcher, prouided before hand for themselues, in an

death, and in abundance of worldly things which they leaue
to theirs behinde them, all which as saith the same Father,
<PB N="124" REF="52">
<HI>viuorum sunt solatia non mortuorum,</HI> are comforts to them
that liue behinde, but no help to them who are dead. I note
this, that considering the magnanimitie of these Ethnicks
in suffering of death, notwithstanding the weake and small
comforts which they had to sustaine them, we may be asha|med

our bodies then be spirituall, because without contradiction
they shall obey the motions of the spirit: the body shall be

when wee speake wee should speake as the oracles of God,

If yee bee such as thinke with those scornefull men in Ie|rusalem,

<P>Now the Consolation being ended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consolation &amp; exhortation both necessary for vs.</NOTE> the Apostle sub|ioynes
the Exhortation, both these two, consolation and ex|hortation,
are needefull for vs in the course of this life: the
one to keepe vs that wee faint not through the remanents
of sinne left in vs, and beginnings of death, which already
haue seased vpon vs: exhortation againe to stir vs vp when
wee linger in the way of godlinesse. For it fareth with vs as
it did with <HI>Lot</HI> in Sodome, the Angels warned him of the
imminent iudgement, and exhorted him to escape for his
life, yet hee delayed and lingred, hee could not bee gotten
out of Sodome, till they (as it were) violently thrust him
out. And allbeit the Lord admonish vs earely and late by
his messengers of that wrath which is to come vpon the
children of disobedience, and warne vs in time to flye to the
mountaine of his saluation, yet alas so loath are wee to for|sake
our old finnes, that the Lord is forced to double his
exhortations vnto vs, all which yet shall not auaile vs, if the
Lord lay not the hands of his grace vpon vs, and by his
holy Spirit make vs obedient to the heauenly vocation. Let
vs therefore take heede to the exhortations made vs by the

<P><PB N="160" REF="63">
<HI>Debters.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ hath freed vs from all other seruice that we might be bound to his owne.</NOTE> Of this it is euident that the doctrine of grace
proclaimes not liberty to men to liue as they will, but rather
bindes them to liue godly: there can be no higher con|tempt
done to the Lord, than to turne his grace into wan|tonnesse.
Certainly the iniquities of Pagans doth not hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
so much offend him, as the licentiousnesse of bastard Chri|stians,
who will sinne the more freely because Christ hath
suffered for sinne: they heare that a man is not iustified by
good workes, and therefore being deceiued by Sathans so|phistrie,
they cease to doe well, not considering that good
workes must proue wee are sanctified, and sanctification
must proue that wee are iustified. In the second verse, the
Apostle said that <HI>Christ hath freed vs from the Law of sinne;</HI>
and here he sayth, that <HI>hee hath made vs debters to righteous|nesse:</HI>
these are not contrary, they agree very well together,
hee hath loosed vs from the seruice of all other Masters,
that he might binde vs the more straightly to serue himselfe.</P>
<P>And indeede if Christ commaund vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is a seruant of seruants, who is not the seruant of Christ Iesus.</NOTE> as hee ought, no
other thing shall commaund vs beside him; otherwise if we
be not seruants to him, we shall be slaues to euery thing be|side

O how many Lords hath that man who hath not Christ
to be his Lord? assuredly there is no thing which will not
vsurpe superioritie ouer thee, who liues not as a bound ser|uant
to Iesus Christ: either thy belly shall become thy God,
and for a mease of pottage with <HI>Esau,</HI> thou shalt sell thy
birth-right and blessing, or a wedge of gold shall become
thy confidence, and thou shalt not care for gaine to loose a
good conscience: or then some other vncouth Lord who
hath no title to thee shall tyrannize ouer thee. Thus wee
see that the Christian libertie we haue by Christ, makes vs
free from the seruitude of sinne, as the Apostle teacheth vs,
and not free to commit sinne, as the carnall Atheist con|ceiues
it.</P>
<P>But seeing we are debters, let vs see with what bondes
wee are bound, surely the obligations are many, by which
<PB N="161" REF="63">
we are bound debters to the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We are bound to do God ser|uice by two great bands especially.</NOTE> but specially now wee
will shortly consider these two, Creation and Redemption.
It is a principle receiued among all men, that the fruit and
vantage of a mans owne workmanship should redound to
himselfe: <HI>Who planteth a vineyard, and eates not of the fruit <MILESTONE N="1">
thereof?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Creation.</NOTE> <HI>or who feedeth a flocke, and eates not of the milke of
the flocke?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. 7.</NOTE> No man begets sonnes and daughters but he will
be honoured of them, hee that hyreth seruants, requires ser|uice
of them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is a shame that man craues that of his in|feriours, which he giues not to his superiour.</NOTE> yea <HI>Balaam</HI> will be offended if his beast serue
him not according to his pleasure: this is the measure wher|with
men mete vnto themselues, what reason then is ther, we
should refuse to doe that dutie vnto the Lord our Supe|riour,
which wee craue to our selues from our Inferiours.
The Lord hath made vs, wee made not our selues; his hand
hath formed and shaped vs; the life we haue wee hold it of
him; we can not abide a moment longer in this house of our
earthly tabernacle, than the Lords thinkes expedient, his
will makes the last day: yea as we said before all our neces|sarie
maintenance for this mortall life, is furnished out of
his hand: seeing wee our selues craue seruice of those to
whem we giue the smallest things, shall wee not much more
giue seruice vnto GOD, from whom wee receiue the
greatest?</P>
<P>The other is the bond of Redemption.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Redemption: here consider first, that we are bought seruants.</NOTE> Wherein we are <MILESTONE N="2">
to consider these three things: first, that vve are bought:
secondly, that we are sworne: thirdly, that we haue receiued
wages before hand; all for this end, that vve should serue
him. <HI>Ye are bought</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>with a price, therefore
glorifie God in your bodies, and in your spirits, for they are Gods.</HI>
And againe, <HI>wee are redeemed, not with corruptible things, as
gold and siluer,</HI> from our vaine conuersation, <HI>but with the pre|tious
bloud of Christ, as of a Lambe vnspotted and vndefiled:</HI>
we should not therefore liue as seruants of men, farre lesse
as seruants of Sathan and sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That which cost Christ full deare, men sels good cheape.</NOTE> but as seruants of that Lord
who hath redeemed vs. Of all fooles those are the greatest
who sels their life for the silly shadowes of sinfull pleasures,
<PB N="162" REF="64">
which Iesus Christ hath bought with the greatest price that
euer was payed.</P>
<P>Not onely are we bought to be Christs seruants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly, Swor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> seruants</NOTE> but also
we are sworne, for baptisme as on the part of God, it is a
seale of the couenant of grace, to confirme that promise of
remission of sinnes, which God hath made to vs in the blood
of Iesus Christ: so on our part it is a solemne resignation
of our selues, and our seruice to the Lord, wherein we giue
vp our names to be enrolled among his souldiers &amp; seruants,
swearing, binding, and oblieging our selues to renounce the
seruice of the Diuell, the World, and the Flesh: and this
oath of resignation we haue renued so oft as wee communi|cated
at his holy Table. Whereof it is euident that they
who hath giuen their names to Christ, and yet liues licenti+ously,
walking after the flesh, are for-sworne Apostates,
guiltie of perfidie, and of foule apostasie and desertion from
Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>And thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thirdly, wee haue receiued wages before hand for ser|uice to be done</NOTE> not onely are we bought and sworne, but
we haue receiued wages and payment in hand, which should
make vs ashamed if we haue so much as common honestie,
to refuse seruice to the Lord, vvhose wages we haue receiued
already. It may be said to euery one of vs, which <HI>Malachie</HI>
in the name of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mal. 1. 10.</NOTE> spake to the Leuiets of his time,
<HI>who among you shuts the dore of my temple, or kindles a fire vpon
my alter in vaine:</HI> &amp; who among vs can stand vp and say that
hee hath done seruice to the Lord for nought? Consider it
when ye will, for euery peece of seruice ye haue done to the
Lord, ye haue receiued wages, more then ten times? who hath
called aright on his name, &amp; hath not been heard? who hath
giuen thanks for benefits receiued, &amp; hath not found Gods
benefits doubled vpon him? who hath giuen almes in the
name of the Lord, and not found increase? I speake not
now of rewards which God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ath promised vs, I speake only
of that we haue receiued already, the least of Gods mercies
shewed vpon vs already doth farre exceede all that seruice
that we poore wretches haue done vnto him: as therefore
<PB N="163" REF="64">
we are content to receiue the Lords pay, let vs neuer refuse
to giue the seruice of our bodyes and spirits vnto him.</P>
<P>But alas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But many re|ceiue that from the true God, which they re|turn no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> to him but sacrifice to Idols.</NOTE> is not this the common sinne of this generation,
to receiue good things out of the hand of God, and with
them to sacrifice vnto other Gods, to whom they owe no
seruice at all. A horrible sacriledge, a vile idolatry: for this
the Lord complaines of the Iewes, <HI>they haue receiued my
gold, and my siluer, and made vp Baal to themselues:</HI> and the
same complaint stands against the prophane men of this
age.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 2. 8.</NOTE> The couetous man as riches encrease doth hee not set
his heart vpon them, though with his tongue hee denie it?
doth he not say within himselfe, that which <HI>Iob</HI> protested
hee would neuer say <HI>to the wedge of Gold, thou art my con|fidence?</HI>
The glutton when hee hath receiued from God
abundance of Wheat, Oyle, and Wine, though hee know
the commandement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 18.</NOTE> <HI>be not filled with wine wherein is excesse,
but be filled with the Spirit,</HI> yet how oft takes hee in super|fluous
drinke, and spares not for loue of it to grieue the
Spirit, sacrificing to his belly as vnto God those things, which
bindes him to doe seruice vnto the Lord? thus neither are
the benefits of God returned to doe honour vnto him from
whom they come, but sacrilegiously also abused to the ma|king
vp of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">al,</HI> or some other Idoll abhominable to God,

haue receiued for doing seruice to God, which they ne|uer

obedience, whereof the Apostle here speakes, wee cannot
with a good conscience desire the Lord to discharge it, nor
exempt vs from it, but wee must in all humilitie craue
Grace of God, that wee being enriched by him, who of our

performe it.</P>
<P>Where if the weake Children of God obiect and say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A three-fold comfort for the godly for the debt of obedi|ence.</NOTE>
how then can wee but drowne in this debt, seeing no day

which we owe vnto him? To this there is giuen a three-fold
<MILESTONE N="1"> comfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord to whom we owe it, giues vs wherewith to pay it.</NOTE> first the Lord dealeth with vs as a louing liberall

to put him to shame, stops priuately into his hand, that
which publikely againe he may giue vnto him, so the Lord
conuaies secret grace into the hearts of his children, where|by
they are in some measure able to serue him: but as <HI>Da|uid</HI>
protested,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 29. 14.</NOTE> so may wee all, whatsoeuer wee giue vnto the
Lord, wee haue it of his owne hand. Secondly, the Lord
<MILESTONE N="2"> our God is so gracious that hee is content to accept part of
payment at our hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He accepts for a time part of payment.</NOTE> till wee bee able to doe better, if our
faith bee but like the graine of Mustard seede, yet if it bee
true, the Lord will not despise it; though our repentance be
not perfect and absolute; though our prayers bee weake;
though wee cannot doe the good that wee would, yet the
good that wee doe is accepted at his hands through Iesus
<MILESTONE N="3"> Christ. And thirdly, wee haue this comfort, that the more
wee pay of this debt of obedience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The more wee pay of this debt the more we are able to pay.</NOTE> the more wee are able
to pay. In other debts it is not so: for if the more be payed
out by him that is indebted, the lesse remaines behinde vnto
himselfe, but here the more wee pay, the richer wee are; the
doing of one good worke of seruice vnto the Lord makes
<PB N="165" REF="65">
vs both more willing, and able to doe an other, the talents
of spirituall Graces being of that nature, that the more
they are vsed the more they are encreased, and these should
worke in vs a delight to pay that debt which wee owe vnto
the Lord.</P>
<P>Last of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good works are debts, ther|fore not merits</NOTE> wee marke vpon this word, that the good

how sayth the Apostle they shall dye? To this I

is that vnto the soule of man, vvhich fire and water are to
the body, that is to say, an vnkindely Element, in the which
it cannot liue, but certainely a more fearefull death abides

wherin they shal not onely liue depriu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d of life, wanting all

the last sentence of damnation shall bee pronounced vpon

that so long as we liue in the bodie, there is euer some re|manent

as man gaue life to sinne, so is hee bound to put out the life
thereof vpon no lesse paine than condemnation, and there|fore
iustly is it required of him. Secondly, these same good
workes vvhich the Lord vvorkes in vs, hee is content to as|scribe
them to vs, and calles them ours. Of our selues vve
must say with the Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 12.</NOTE> <HI>we are not sufficient of our selues
to thinke so much as a good thought,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore vve should be hum|ble and giue God the glory</NOTE> our sufficiencie is of God,
and it is hee who worketh in vs both the vvill and the deed:
so hee workes in vs that he makes vs through his grace vvil|ling
vvorkers vvith him, through him that strengthens vs
vve are able to doe all things, and therefore the praise of
all the good wee can doe should be ascribed vnto God.
When <HI>Dauid</HI> had offered to God aboundance of siluer and
gold, and other mettels vvhich hee had prepared for the
house of God, hee concludes in the humilitie of his heart,
<HI>What am I O Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chro. 29. 14</NOTE> <HI>and what is my people, that wee should be
able to offer willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee,
and of thine owne hand haue wee giuen thee.</HI> But much more
vvhen vve doe any worke of sanctification, for the building
<PB N="178" REF="71">
of our selues vp into a spirituall Temple to the Lord our
God, we may say, O Lord all the good wee can doe is of
thee, and of thine owne hand wee haue giuen backe vnto
thee, for except thou Lord hadst giuen vnto vs grace, vve
should neuer haue giuen to thee obedience.</P>
<P>Let therefore the presumptuous conceit of Merit yet
againe be farre from vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presumptuous opinion of Me|rit damned.</NOTE> seeing the good which vve doe is
debt, and is done also by the spirit of the Lord in vs, let vs
reserue the glory thereof vnto him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de verb.</NOTE> <HI>Quare dona mea, non

thy merits, thou shouldst neuer bee pertaker of my gifts.
When the Apostle Saint <HI>Paul</HI> had reckoned out how hee
had laboured more aboundantly in the worke of the
ministerie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 15. 10</NOTE> then all the rest of the Apostles, hee subioynes
as it were by correction, <HI>yet not I but the grace of God in me:</HI>
learning vs when vve haue done all the good we can to be
humble in our selues, and giue the glory to God: if he pro|mise
vs a crowne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. hom. 14</NOTE> <HI>nihil aliud coronat nisi dona sua,</HI> he crownes
no other thing but his owne gifts, if by promise hee bindes
himselfe a debter vnto vs to giue vs a reward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de verb.</NOTE> <HI>debitor factus

promittendo,</HI> he is become a debter vnto vs, not by receiuing
any thing from vs, but by promosing freely to vs that which
pleased him: and therefore when we are exhorted to mor|tifie
the deeds of the body by the spirit, let vs first turne this
and the like of the precepts into prayers, that the Lord
would enable vs by grace to doe that which he commaunds
vs, and then when in some measure we haue done it, that we
returne the praise and glory to the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Mortifie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A tryall of our Mortification.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Seeing the first part of our sanctification
is called mortification, vve are to consider hovv in this word
there lurkes a rule, vvhereby euery man may try hovv farre
forth he hath profited in sanctification, vve see by experi|ence
that the neerer a man drawes to death, the lesse motion
<PB N="179" REF="71">
is in him, but after hee is once dead hee moues not at all;
present him pleasant obiects, they delight him not, praise
him, yet he is not puffed vp, speake euill of him, yet he is
not offended: euen so is it with the spirituall man, the grea|ter
progresse he makes in sanctification, the motions of sin
are euer the weaker in him, the pleasures of the world moues
him not, as they were wont, if thou praise him, the breath
of thy mouth cannot lift him vp, if thou offend him, the
more he is mortified, the lesse he is grieued. As a man (saith
<HI>Basile</HI>) being dead is seperate from those with whom he was
conuersant before, so hee who is mortified is instantly sun|dred
in his affections from those who before were his fami|liar
companions in sinne: yea those actions wherein he de|lighted
before, are a griefe vnto him now, it is a vexation
of his soule to heare and see the vnrighteous deedes of the
wicked, which were wont to be vnto him the matter of his
sport and laughter.</P>
<P>Therefore doth he wish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death to sinne takes not life away but re|stores it.</NOTE> and so should we, that we might
alwayes die this kind of death, <HI>foelix mors quae alienum facit
hominem ab hoc saeculo,</HI> certainly it is a happy death which
alienates, and turnes away the hart of man from the loue
of this world. <HI>Bona mors quippe vitam non aufert, sed trans|fert
in melius,</HI> for it is a good kinde of death, which doth
not take life away, but changes it into a better. But alas how
farre are we from this spirituall disposition? doth not the an|gry
countenance of one in wordly authoritie terrifie vs?
the disdainfull words of men doe they not put vs out of the
state of patience? if the world flatter vs are we not puft vp?
if she frowne vpon vs, are wee not cast downe? and this
our great weakenesse proceeds onely from the strength of
sinne in vs: this lets vs see what cause we haue to bee hum|bled,
considering that hauing liued long in this time of grace,
yet haue we profited little in the mortification of our sinfull
lusts and affections.</P>
<P>Againe, out of this same word of Mortification, wee
learne that the worke of our Sanctification is a worke of
<PB N="180" REF="72">
difficultie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sanctification is a work of difficultie, for it is a birth, a death, a cir|cumcision, &amp;c.</NOTE> not accomplished without labour, paine, and do|lour,
for it receiues these three names, as to bee called, Mor|tification,
Regeneration, and Circumcision. As no birth,
no death, no cutting off the flesh can bee without dolour
and sorrow; so the conuersion of a sinner is not wrought
without inward paine and sorrow. The Infant that hath laid
but nine Moneths in the wombe of the mother, is not deli|uered
without great paine, suppose shee conceiued it with
pleasure: and shalt thou thinke to part with sinne, which
in thee was conceiued with thee, and which since so often
thou hast nourished with pleasure, and not to proue the do|lours
of the New-birth? No assuredly. In the worke of
mans conuersion, there is the contrite spirit, the humbled
heart, the mourning weede, the melting eye, the pale coun|tenance,
the voyce of lamentation; let not such as feele them,
if they find therwith a rending of their affections from their
old sins, be troubled; for these are but the dolors of their new
birth; and for others who know not these inward humilia|tions
and wrestlings of the Children of God, they haue iust
cause to suspect themselues, that they haue not so much as
the beginnings of Mortification, Regeneration, and spiri|tuall
Circumcision.</P>
<P><HI>By the Spirit.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The knife by which beastly lusts are slaine to be sacrificed</NOTE> Nature will not destroy our sinfull lusts,
they are mortified by the Spirit of Christ, and therefore vve

vnder the Law, were first slaine by the knife of the Leuite,
and then offered to God vpon the Altar; so the Lord Iesus
must mortifie our affections by the power of his word and

he proues it. They who mortefie the deedes of
the body by the Spirit, or they who <HI>are led by the Spirit of

therefore they must liue; the necessitie of the consequence

are gathered before them to resist them and hold them out
of <HI>Canaan,</HI> but the shepheard and leader of Israell steps ouer
all these impediments, as if they had not beene in the way,
and places his people in the mountaine of his inheritance:
and afterward when he concluded to bring his people from
Babell homeward to Canaan, he prepared a way for them
in the Wildernesse, he commaunded the mountaines to bee
made low, and the vallies to be exalted, he commanded the
crooked to be straight, and the rough places to become
plaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort.</NOTE> and it was done. This is for our comfort, the Lord
who hath taken vs by the hand to lead vs into his holy ha|bitation,
shall remoue all impediments that are before vs;
though Sathan like a Lyon spoyled of his pray snatch after
vs, though he double his tentations vpon vs, and with ma|nifold
afflictions compasse vs, though terrible death and the
horrible graue stand before vs, threatning to swallow vs by
the way, yet shall we see the goodnesse of the Lord in the
land of the liuing, and ouer all our enimies shall be more
than conquerors, through him that loued vs, and hath taken
vs into his owne hand, to lead vs to that inheritance which
he hath prepared for vs.</P>
<P>For it is manifest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The beginning progresse and perfection of our saluation is from him.</NOTE> that both the beginning, progresse, and
perfection of our saluation is ascribed to the spirit of God
in holy scriptures: when we were dead in sinne he quickned
vs, when he hath quickned vs, he gouernes and leads vs, and
worketh continually in vs till he perfect vs. Thus is he <HI>the
author and the finisher of our faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 2.</NOTE> and all the glory of our
saluation is his: as wee cannot begin to doe well without
him, so we cannot continue in well doing without him: if he

the vvay of iniquitie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In that we can not walk with|out a guide, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re warned that we are but babes.</NOTE></P>
<P>It should serue to humble vs, that wee are pointed out

When the Lord threatned that hee would no
more goe before the Children of Israel, to lead them as hee
had done, <HI>Moses</HI> tooke it so deepely to heart, that he prote|sted
he would not goe one foote further except the Lord
went with him: and certainely if wee knew the manifold in|conueniences,
whereunto wee shall fall if the Lord forsake
vs, wee would neuer enter our feete into that way, wherein
wee saw not the Lord going before vs in mercy to lead vs.</P>
<P>Our life on earth should be ordered as was the life of
Israell in the wildernesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We ought to follow our guide as Israell did the Lord in the wilder|nesse.</NOTE> the Lord went before them by

<HEAD><BIBL>Verse. 15.</BIBL>
<Q>For yee haue not receiued the Spirit of
bondage to feare againe, but the Spirit of Adoption,
whereby wee cry Abba Father.</Q></HEAD>
<P>_THe Apostle to strengthen his former argument,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A three-fold operation of the spirit in the Sons of God.</NOTE>
sets downe a short discription in this and the
subsequent verse, of a threefold operation which
the spirit maketh in them whom he leadeth: for
first, he is vnto them a spirit of bondage, work|ing
feare: Secondly, he is a Spirit of Adoption, working loue
through the sense of Gods mercy, for hee not onely makes
them whom hee leades the Sonnes of God, but intimates
vnto their spirits Gods loue towards them, which otherwise
was vnknowne vnto them: and thirdly, hee is a Spirit of
intercession, making vs to goe with boldnesse to the throne
of grace, and call vpon God as vpon our Father. Of the
which the first part of his argument is made cleare, that they
who are led by the spirit of God are the Sonnes of God,
yea, by the testimonie of the Spirit they themselues know
that it is so, and therefore in most homely and humble man|ner
acknowledge him for their Father. This the Apostle
propones in such a manner that hee applyes it particularly
to the Godly Romaines, vnto whom hee writeth, <HI>Yee haue
not</HI> (saith he) <HI>receiued againe the Spirit of bondage vnto feare,</HI>
as yee did in the time of your first conuersion; yee haue
proceeded further, and haue experience of his other ope|rations,
then yee felt him casting you downe with the sight
of your sinnes, but now ye feele him comforting you and
raising you vp with the sense of Gods loue and mercy to|ward
you in Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>The spirit of God is called <HI>a Spirit of bondage vnto feare,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why in his first operation he is called a spirit of bondage to fear</NOTE>
not as if hee made them in whom hee worketh slaues or
bond-men, but because in his first operation hee rebukes
them of sinne, in whom hee worketh, and lets them see that
bondage and seruitude vnder which they lye, which works
<PB N="189" REF="74">
in them an horrible feare, but in his second operation he is
a spirit of Adoption, making them free who were bound
before; comforting them with the sight of Gods mercy,
whom before he terrified with the sight of their owne sins,
to the one hee vseth the preaching of the Law, which dis|couers
our disease; to the other the preaching of the Gos|pell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the preach|ing of the Law he discouers sin and wrath due to it, which causeth feare.</NOTE>
which points out the Physition. As the proclayming
of the Law wrought a terrour in their hearts who heard it,
so doth the preaching thereof: for who can heare himselfe
accursed and condemned by the mouth of God and not
tremble? <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist began at the preaching of the
Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Now is the axe laid to the root of the tree, euery tree that
bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewen downe and cast into
the fire:</HI> then hee proceeded and poynted out the Lambe
of God that takes away the sinnes of the world; by the first
hee prepared a way to the second: for his auditours being
cast downe in themselues with the threatning, enquired
earnestly <HI>what shall wee doe then that we may bee saued?</HI> and
were glad to heare of a remedy. It is out of doubt, that they
who are not touched with a remorse for their sinnes, nor a
feare of the wrath to come, and into whose hearts neuer
entred that care, <HI>what shall I doe that I may be saued?</HI> haue
not knowne as yet so much as the very beginnings of sal|uation.</P>
<P>Wee are not then to thinke here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hee is not here comparing the godly vnder the Law vvith the godly vnder the Gospell.</NOTE> that the Apostle is
comparing the Godly vnder the Gospell, with the Godly
vnder the Law, but hee is comparing the Godly vnder the
Gospell with themselues; their second experience of the
operation of the Spirit with the first, it is true that once
(sayth hee) <HI>yee receiued the Spirit of bondage working feare,</HI>
this was his first operation in you, but now yee haue expe|rience
of another, and are made pertakers of a more ex|cellent
operation, hee is become vnto you a Spirit of A|doption,
by whom yee call vpon God as vpon your Fa|ther.</P>

in them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A seruile feare.</NOTE> The third sort is seruile feare, the obiect

to the wicked, they feare the plagues of God, but so
that they loue their sinnes, and hates and abhorres euery
<MILESTONE N="4"> one that doth snibbe or restraine them in the course of their
sinnes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A filiall feare.</NOTE> The fourth is filiall, so called because it is proper
to the sonnes of God; they doe not onely feare him for his
iudgements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 130. 4.</NOTE> but loue him and feare him for his mercy: <HI>mercy
<MILESTONE N="5"> is with thee O Lord, that thou mayst be feared.</HI> As for the Di|abolicall
feare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Diabolicall feare.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Iames</HI> saith the Diuels know there is a

within themselues the sentence of damnation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames. 2. 19.</NOTE> they know it
shall neuer be recalled, they seeke no mercy, nor shall they
obtaine it: and the seruile feare of the wicked shall at the last
end in this desperate feare of the damned, finding themselues
condemned, without all further hope of mercy, they shall
tremble and feare continually.</P>
<P>Of this it is euident that the feare wherof here he speaks
is the first part of filiall feare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From what sort of feare are we exempted?</NOTE> namely, a feare of that punish|ment
which is due to sinne, and to the godly is an intro|duction,
to worke in them feare of God for his mercies, con|ioyned
with loue: so then his meaning is cleere, albeit in the
time of your first conuersion you were striken with a feare
of that wrath which is the recompense of sinne, yet now the
spirit of adoption hath not onely released you of that feare
of damnation, which you conceiued at the first, through the
knowledge of your sinnes, but hath also made you certaine
of saluation, and assured that God is become your father in
Christ Iesus.</P>
<P>In the wicked the feare of Gods wrath once begunne
encreases daily, till it proceede as I spake, to that desperate
<PB N="193" REF="75">
feare of the damned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the godly feare prepares a place for the perfect loue of God, and then departs it selfe.</NOTE> but in the godly the feare of Gods
iudgements is but a preparation to the loue of God, feare
shall not alwayes abide in their harts, for when God shall
crowne them with his mercies, and his loue in them shall
be perfect, then perfect loue casts out feare: therefore <HI>Au|gustine</HI>
compares the feare of Gods iudgements in the godly
to a Needle, that goes through the seame, and prepares in
it a place for the thread, which is to remaine: so doth the
feare of Gods iudgements goe through the secret seames
of the hart, and prepares a place for the loue of God, which
shall abide and continue for euer in the godly, when feare
shall bee away. The Lord at the first deales hardly with
his children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 15.</NOTE> as our Sauiour delt with the woman of Canaan,
whom hee comforted at the last; and as <HI>Ioseph</HI> entreated his
brethren roughly, whom at the last for tender compassion
hee imbraced with many teares: but all these terrours and
feares wherewith God humbles his owne, are but prepara|tiues
to his consolations; at the length hee shall make it
knowne to them, that hee is their louing father: as for the
wicked, though they haue not suffered from their youth the
terrours of God, it is because they are reserued for them.</P>
<P>Neither are they euen now exempted from their owne
feares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But in the wic|ked feare of wrath once be|gun encreases till it proceede to desp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rate feare.</NOTE> for albeit there were none to reproue them, their

them; and if at any time they shall heare the word of God
faithfully, and with power deliuered vnto them, then doe
they much more tremble &amp; feare: for the word strengthens
the conscience to accuse and terrifie them, but feare is both
the first and last effect it workes in them; and therefore is
it that being so oft disquieted with hearing of the word, as
<HI>Felix</HI> was with the preaching of <HI>Paul,</HI> they are no more de|sirous
to heare it, but rather hates it and abhors it, because
it testifies no good vnto them, more than <HI>Micaiah</HI> did to

by calling, saith, they are sanctified by Christ; and call vpon

to tell vs that they who are not called by God, and sancti|fied
in Christ, cannot call vpon him; as for prophane men
it is certain they cannot pray, though they repeat that prayer
<HI>Our Father which art in heauen,</HI> what else doe they but mul|tiply

this proceeds from the operation of the Spirit who bends

so in prayer should there bee an earnestnesse of the powers
of our soule to send vp our desires. As incense without fire

<P>_THE mortification of a Christian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mortifica|tion of a Chri|stian consists in two things.</NOTE>
whereunto the spirit of GOD so
frequently exhorts vs, consists in
these two, first in a subduing by
a holy Discipline our inordinate
lustes, which naturally rebell a|gainst
the law of God: secondly,
in a patient bearing of the Crosse
of Iesus. In the first part of the
Chapter, the Apostle hath exhorted vs vnto the one, and
now in the second, by many arguments he strengthens vs
against the other: vnlesse wee make some profit in the
first point of mortification, it is certaine we shall neuer pro|ceed
to the second. For the life of one affection is far lesse

preuailes most to make man impatient, and so driue him to
blaspheme God. And therefore most of all wee are to con|firme
our weakenesse against the crosse, since in it the eni|mie
of our saluation placeth his principall strength. Let vs
hearken to the Apostle, who as a minister of Iesus indeede,
and a heauenly Phisition, sent to vs from the Lord our
God, doth here temper the bitter waters of <HI>Marah,</HI> and
make them sweet vnto all the Israell of God.</P>
<P>The first argument of comfort is set downe in this lat|ter
end of the 17.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first prin|cipal argument against the crosse is from the end of our afflictions.</NOTE> Verse, and it is taken partly from the
nature of out sufferings, they are sufferings with Christ, and
partly from the end thereof, which is to raigne with Christ
in glory. Here first we learne that suffering must goe before
glory: <HI>the husband-man must labour before hee receiue the
fruits,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. 2. 8.</NOTE> <HI>neither is hee that striueth for a maisterie crowned, ex|cept
hee striue as hee ought.</HI> The prince of saluation was con|secrated
by affliction, it behoued him first to suffer and then
to enter into his kingdome. All that professe him are de|sirous
with the sonnes of <HI>Zebedeus,</HI> to sit some at his right
hand, and some at his left, but are not so content to drinke
of his cuppe, and be baptised with his baptisme. <HI>Volunt
omnes te frui,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernard</NOTE> <HI>at non ita &amp; imitari, conregnare cupiunt, sed non
compati,</HI> they would all enioy thee, knowing that pleasures
for euermore are at thy right hand, but are not content to
follow thee, they all desire to raigne with thee, but not so
to suffer with thee: but this is a preposterous way, it is to
diuide those things which the Lord here hath ioyned to|gether,
except first we suffer with him, we shall not hereaf|ter
raigne with him.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Different cour|ses of the Chri|stian &amp; world|ling.</NOTE> let vs marke here the different courses of the
Christian and worldling, the Christian by temporall trou|ble
goes on to eternall glory, the worldling by temporall
glory goes on to eternall shame. If yee goe to the Schoole
of Iesus, the first ABC of religion taught you there, will
bee this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10. 38.</NOTE> <HI>If any man will be my Disciple, let him denie himselfe
take vp his Crosse and follow mee:</HI> if yee goe to the Schoole
<PB N="221" REF="84">
of Sathan, the first ABC of Atheisme taught there is this,
<HI>All the kingdomes of the world will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall
downe and worship mee.</HI> The Lord Iesus through light and
momentanie afflictions, leades his children to an infinite
waight of glory; but Sathan through the present perishing
pleasure of sinne, leades his miserable captiues to euerlast|ing
paine:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5.</NOTE> therefore it is said of our Sauiour of the one, <HI>bles|sed
are yee that mourne for yee shall be comforted,</HI> and of the
other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 6. 25.</NOTE> <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e bee to you that laugh now, for yee shall waite and
weepe.</HI></P>
<P>As there is no comparison betweene these two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Christian is better than his beginning, not so with the worldling.</NOTE> so blessed
shall wee be if wee make choyse of the best. <HI>Moses</HI> estee|med
the rebuke of Christ, greater riches than the treasures
of Egypt; because he had respect to the recompense of re|ward:
and shall not we reioyce in our present afflictions,
considering they are the way vnto our glory? <HI>if wee sowe in
teares, wee shall reape in ioy.</HI> The end of the godly is better
than their beginning, <HI>for the light of the righteous encreaseth
more and more, like the Sunne vnto the noone day,</HI> they begin
with teares, and they end with ioy: but the light of the
wicked is like vnto the light of a candle, it shineth for a
while, and incontinent ends in stincking smoake: as <HI>Belta|sars</HI>
banquet was concluded with a cuppe of wrath, so all
the pleasures of the wicked ends in paine. At that banquet
in Cana, the Lord Iesus brought in the finest wine hind|most,
but Sathan doth with his miserable banquetters, as the
gouernours of that feast speakes, hee presents his best first,
and after when they haue well dronken, brings in that which
is worse; in the entry he presents the deceitfull pleasures of
sinne, but doolefull and lamentable is their end: for what bet|ter
portion can he giue vnto them, than is prepared for him|selfe?
he is reserued to blacknesse of darknesse, tribulation,
and anguish of Spirit, terrour and horrible wrath, shame
and endlesse confusion is prepared for him, and all those
who are portioners with him.</P>

the Lord being so present with vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cip. lib. 2. epist. 6.</NOTE> <HI>non vt seruos suos spectet
tantum, sed vt ipse luctetur in nobis,</HI> that hee doth not onely
behold his seruants in their conflicts, but hee himselfe also
doth wrestle in them.</P>
<P>Where for our further comfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things required to make our suffe|rings sufferings with Christ.</NOTE> if any man be desirous to
know, whether if his sufferings be sufferings with Christ, or
not, let him consider these three things: first, how Iesus
<PB N="225" REF="85">
receiued the Crosse as a cuppe giuen to him out of his Fa|thers
hand, neither looking to <HI>Iudas</HI> that betrayed him, nor
to the Iewes that pursued him. Secondly, hee receiued it
not grudgingly nor impatiently, but with an humble sub|mission
of his will, to the will of his Father. Thirdly, hee
suffered for this end, that he might abolish sinne, and destroy
him who had the power of death. If these three concurre in
thy sufferings, thou mayest be sure they are suffrings with
Christ: first, if passing by the instrument of thy trouble,
thou looke to the hand of God, tempering and giuing it
vnto thee: secondly, if thou receiue it with a humble sub|mission
of thy spirit to him who is the Father of Spirits:
and thirdly, if it worke in thee a mortification of thy sinfull
lusts and affections.</P>
<P>And of this we haue to make our vse in all our afflicti|ons
inward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort a|gainst inward Afflictions.</NOTE> or outward: and first concerning inward af|flictions,
if at any time it please the Lord to exercise vs with
fearefull agonies of Conscience, let vs looke vnto GOD,
who killes and makes aliue, who casts downe and raises vp;
let vs for a while beare his indignation, he abides but a mo|ment
in his anger: if we finde that by them wee are more
humbled, wakened out of securitie, and stirred vp more
feruently to pray, and that the life of sinne is weakened in
vs, let vs be out of all doubt, that these inward troubles are
sufferings with Christ; whose soule for our sinnes was hea|uie
vnto the death, and his body did sweat blood, through
the vehement anguish of his spirit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort a|gainst outward Afflictions which wee suf|fer either in name,</NOTE> And as for outward suf|ferings,
they are either such as concernes our Name, our
goods, or our persons. As for those which concerne our
name: it is a singular pollicy of Sathan, to beare downe the
children of God, in the estimation of others, <HI>vt qui conscien|tiae
suae luce clarescunt, alienis rumoribus sordidentur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrose.</NOTE> that they
who are glorious in the light of their owne conscience, may
be made filthie by the false reports of others, and so made
vnprofitable to doe others the good that they would: but
let vs in such tentations learne from <HI>Dauid,</HI> to looke vnto
<PB N="226" REF="86">
God, and not to <HI>Shimei,</HI> vsing the vndes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rued contumeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
of men, as profitable meanes to worke in vs that inward
humiliation, which our man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fold sinnes, though not against
man, yet against God requireth of vs: so shall we suffer with
him, who being the innocent Lambe of God, sustayned
neuerthelesse great contradiction of sinners, reproched to
be one possessed with a Diuell, notwithstanding that hee
was the very sonne of God, filled in his manhood with the
holy Ghost.</P>
<P>And as concerning the losse of worldly goods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or in our goods.</NOTE> who
euer bee the instrument, learne thou to take it as a cup out
of the hand of thy heauenly Father, after the example of <HI>Iob,</HI>
who passing by the Sabeans and the Caldeans, looked to
the hand of God, <HI>the Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath ta+ken,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 1. 21.</NOTE>
(saith hee) <HI>blessed be the name of the Lord.</HI> It is not for
lacke of loue that the mother withdrawes from the Childe
the vse of the pappe, but that shee may acquaint him with
stronger meat: and if the Lord take from vs these transito|rie
things, it is not because we are not beloued of him, but
that we may set our harts vpon those things which are more
waightie and permanent; which if wee doe then are our
sufferings, sufferings with him, who being rich became
poore, that in all things we might be made rich in him.</P>
<P>And the same are we to doe in those troubles which we
sustayne in our bodyes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or in our persons.</NOTE> for if (as the Apostles sayth) wee
haue had fathers of our bodies who haue corrected vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 9.</NOTE> and
we haue giuen them reuerence, should we not much rather
be in subiection to the father of Spirits, that we might liue?
and if we can yeeld our bodies to phisitions to be cut or burnt
at their pleasure, how much more should wee submit them
to the Lord in all humble contentment to be chastised, as
he will? seeing hee protests himselfe hee doth it not, but for
our singular profit, <HI>that wee might be pertakers of his holines.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We shall raigne with Christ.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In trouble it is expedient to looke vnto the end thereof.</NOTE> Worldlings wrestles for their
corruptible crowne, as vncertaine whether they shall obtaine
it or no, but it is not so with the Christian, we runne not as

vncertaine, we are sure that if we suffer with Christ, we shall
also raigne with him: though for the present no trouble bee
sweet, yet is the end thereof most comfortable; and we are
by the eyes of faith to looke vnto it, least our present mani|fold
tentations driue vs vnto impatience, for as he that going
through a strong running riuer is in danger to fall &amp; drowne
by reason of the dissinesse of his braine, vnlesse he fixe his
eyes vpon the bancke; so shall we be ready to faint in affli|ction,
vnlesse we looke to the comfortable end thereof. If
we shall looke to <HI>Lazarus</HI> vpon the dunghill, and <HI>Ioseph</HI> in
the prison, what can wee iudge them to be but miserable
men? but if we consider their end, we shall see the one in
<HI>Abrahams</HI> bosome, and the other raigning in great glory
vnder <HI>Pharoah</HI> in Egipt; then shall wee say, <HI>verely there is
fruit for the righteous,</HI> and we shall find it true, which here
the Apostle saith, <HI>that if we suffer with Christ, we shall also
raigne with him.</HI></P>

<HEAD><BIBL>Verse 18.</BIBL>
<Q>For I count that the afflictions of this pre|sent
time are not worthie of the glory to be reuealed.</Q></HEAD>
<P>_THe Apostle here subioynes an amplification
of his first argument:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amplification of the first prin|cipal argument.</NOTE> wee shall not onely (saith
hee) raigne with Christ, but raigne in such a
glory, as doth so farre surmount all our present
sufferings, that if they be weighed together in
a balance, the one shall bee found but light in regard of the
other.</P>
<P><HI>For I count.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He that tasted both of present sufferings and of glory to come, giues his iudgement here of both.</NOTE> The word the Apostle vseth here, imports
thus much, after reasoning I conclude, or, after iust recko|ning
this is the summe which I collect and gather: here then
are two circumstances which great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y amplifies his purpose,
one that hee sets not downe this as an vncertaine opinion,
but as a most sure conclusion gathered out of good reason.
And againe that it is the conclusion of such a one, as by
<PB N="228" REF="87">
experience knew both: what experience the Apostle had of
our present suffering, hee telleth vs, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. what expe|rience
he had <HI>of the glory to be reuealed,</HI> he tels vs, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.
so that his words wee are to consider this way, let other
men count and reckon as they will, this is my reckoning,
who haue proued them both, there is no comparison be|tweene
them. What knowledge hee had of the weight of
our present sufferings, he tels you by a three-fold vniuersa|litie:
first, that hee had suffered all kinde of crosses, hunger,
thirst, cold, nakednesse, rods, stonings, imprisonnings: se|condly,
that he suffered in all places, in the sea, in the land,
in the citie, in the wildernesse, where euer he came to preach
the Gospell, there was he persecuted, by some one sort of
trouble or other: thirdly, that hee suffered of all sorts of
persons, both of the Gentiles, and of his owne nation, both
of open enimies, and of false brethren. Againe, as for his ex|perience
of the glory to be reuealed, hee tels you how hee
was taken vp into Paradise, and there heard such words as
cannot be reuealed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The one he ta|sted in his iour|nie from Ieru|salem to Illiri|cum, the other in his iourney from earth to heauen.</NOTE> This conclusion therefore is the more
to be esteemed of vs, because he who giues out this iudge|ment
of the excellency of the one aboue the other, is such a
one, as had experience of them both, hee made a iourney
on earth from Ierusalem to Illiricum, all which way prea|ching
the Gospell, he suffered many afflictions; he made
another iourney from earth to heauen, whether in the body
or out of the body hee could not tell, and there he saw that
inutterable glory: and comparing with himselfe these two
together, hee giues out this for a finall sentence, that all our
present afflictions are but light, in respect of that infinite
weight of glory to bee reuealed. As for worldlings wee are
not to stand vpon their testimonie, for as hee cannot giue
ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> right sentence between two parties that heares not both
their causes, so cannot the worldling who knows somthing
both of the pleasures and sorrows of this life, but nothing
of the ioyes which are to come, consider how farre the life
to come is to be preferred before this: and therfore albeit in
<PB N="229" REF="87">
the conclusions of his heart hee giue out sentence in fa|uours
of the life present, we are not to regard it, because he
hath not heard nor considered, that which tends to the com|mendation
of the other.</P>
<P>Wee see then here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the cer|taintie of the glory to come mittigates our present trouble.</NOTE> how that our strength in trouble is
greatly encreased by the sight, at least by the certaintie, of
that glory which will be the ende of our trouble: this sight
made the Apostle count light of his present sufferings: let
<HI>Stephen</HI> haue his eyes in prayer to see the Heauens opened,
and Iesus standing at the right hand of God, and hee shall
not bee moued with the stones which the Iewes violently
throw at him: let <HI>Moses</HI> see him who is inuisible, and hee
shall not feare <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> let him see that recompense of re|ward,
and he shall be better contented to suffer rebuke with
the people of God, than to enioy the treasures of Egypt:
this is that which made the Martyres stand exulting and re|ioycing,
euen then when Infidels tormented their bodyes.
If they had beene in the body, they had felt the paine, and
it had disquieted them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ber. in. Cant. ser. 61.</NOTE> <HI>nunc vero non mirum si exules a cor|pore,
dolores non sentiant corporis,</HI> but now no meruaile that
being out of the body, they felt not the dolors of the body:
and where thinke yee was then the soule of the Martyr?
certainely in a sure place, euen <HI>in Petra,</HI> in the rocke of in|uincible,
in the bowels of Christ, <HI>non sua sentit, dum Christi
vulnera intuetur,</HI> hee feeleth not his owne wounds, while as
stedfastly hee fixeth his eyes vpon the wounds of Christ,
neyther will hee be afraid for the losse of this life, who hath
laid hold vpon eternall life, and is made sure of a better.</P>
<P>Let vs therefore pray vnto God diligently,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It should make vs despise both the threatnings &amp; allurements of men.</NOTE> that our eyes
may be opened, to see the riches of that glorious inheri|tance,
that as wee speake and heare of it, so in like manner

The Psalmist againe compares our life to a spanne or hand

away before wee can know what were doing in it: to a

thought, which is not well begunne, when it is ended: and
last of all to a declyning shadow, as is the shadow of the
Sunne in the setting, which a man shall see on the toppe
of a mountaine lesse and lesse, vanishing till it be no more.
The Apostle S. <HI>Paul</HI> compares our life to a race, and S.
<HI>Iames</HI> compares it to a smoke or vapour.</P>
<P>Thus we see how little the spirit of God esteemes of that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pleasures of this life are worme-eaten.</NOTE>

better estate, vnto the which they shall be restored, when

this argument verse 22. And this purpose he handles at the

which is threefold: first, concerning God: secondly,
concerning the godly: and thirdly, concerning the wicked.
Concerning God, this is a fearefull abuse, that the creature
which God made for his glory, is abused to his dishonour;
<MILESTONE N="1"> as when the Iewes tooke the gold and siluer which God

<P><MILESTONE N="2"> Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning the godly.</NOTE> the creature is abused as concerning the godly,
when they are compelled to doe euill to those to whom they
would doe good: for euery creature in the owne kinde, is
naturally bent to be a comfortable instrument, and a seruant
to the seruant of God; but otherwise, where the fire is for|ced
to burne them, or the water to choke them, or that they
are in any such sort abused by the wicked, to trouble the
seruants of God, it is against their will, a vanitie and seruitude,
whereof they faine would be deliuered.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="94">
<MILESTONE N="3"> And thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning the wicked whom against their will they serue.</NOTE> the creatures are abused when they are
compelled to serue the wicked rebels and enimies of God,
sore against their will. The Sunne is weary of shining to the
wicked, who hauing their eyes open to see the workes of
God, had neuer their hearts nor mouths open to glorifie
him; the Earth in like manner is wearied of the heauie bur|then
of sinne, which daily increases vpon her; she cryes vnto
God, and desires to be releeued of this bondage, yea, if the
Lord did not restraine her, she would open her mouth and
swallow the wicked, as she did <HI>Corah, Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram:</HI>
and in very deed when once the creature shall be set at li|berty,
and no superiour power shall hold them vnder this
seruitude, then shall the creatures declare that they serued
the wicked sore against their will, for no creature shall ren|der
any more seruice vnto them; the Sunne shall shine no
more vpon them, the Earth shall beare them no longer,
and the water shall not giue so much as one drop out of
her treasures to refresh them.</P>
<P>To cleare this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The creatures being restored to the liberty shall all concur to plague the wicked.</NOTE> out of that one temporall iudgement in|flicted
vpon the stife-necked Egiptians, we may take some
notice how fearefull that last and vniuersall wrath shall be,
that shall be powred out vpon all the wicked, being assem|bled
into one. Out of the third heauen came his Angell to
fight against them, and slew their first borne. In the second
heauen the Sunne withdrew his countenance from them, as
from a people of darknesse, not worthie of his light. In the
third heauen the elements by course fought against them,
the Fire flashed out terrible flames into their faces; the soft
Water gushed out of the bowels of the clouds, and was tur|ned
into hard stones, to strike them, who in the hardnesse of
their harts rebelled against God: the Aire became pesti+lentious
to them, and corrupted their bodies with Biles and
Botches: the waters beneath were turned into bloud; the
earth was poysoned with venemous flyes, which made it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ot,
abhominable Frogs made their land stinck, for the lothsom|nesse

there is nothing belonging to them, were it neuer so small,
but the wrath of God seased vpon it. This was but a tempo|rall
and perticular iudgement, yet doth it make vnto vs some
representation of that vniuersall iudgement, wherein all the
creatures of God shall concurre and lend their helps to tor|ment
the wicked, when the full cuppe of Gods wrath shall
be powred out vpon them.</P>
<P><HI>Not of the owne will.</HI> This is (as we said before) figura|tiuely
spoken of the creature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How a will is ascribed to the creature.</NOTE> that it is said to haue a will.
For the will of the creature is no other thing, but the natu|rall
inclination of the creature; and the meaning is, that the
creature of the owne nature is not subiect to this vanitie, but
that it is subdued vnder it, by the superiour power of God,
for the sinne of man. Where if it be asked how stands this
with iustice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How stands it with iustice that the crea|ture is punished for mans sinne?</NOTE> that the creature which sinned not, should be
subiected to vanitie for the sinne of man? The question is
easily answered, if we consider that the creatures were not
made for themselues, but for the vse and seruice of man, and
that whatsoeuer change to the worse is come vpon them, is
not their punishment, but a part of ours. If earthly Kings
without violation of iustice may punish their rebels, not one|ly
in their persons, but by demolition of their houses, or o|therwise
in their goods and substance, how shall we be bold
to reproue the Lords doing, who hauing conuinced man of
a notorious treason, hath not onely punished himselfe, but
defaced the house wherein he set him to dwell? seeing hee
hath violated the band of his seruice vnto God, what reason
is it that Gods creatures should continue in the first course
of their seruice to him? surely it stands with the righteous
iudgement of God, that his creatures should become com|fortlesse
seruants to man, seeing man of his owne free will
<PB N="259" REF="95">
is become an vnprofitable servent to his God, yea a wicked
rebell against him.</P>
<P>And againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fall of An|gels, of man, &amp; of the creature compared.</NOTE> that the Apostle sayth the change which
is made in the creature, is against the will of the creature, it
serues greatly for our humiliation. The fall of Apostate
Angels was a fall by sinne, but with their will, and without
a Tempter to allure them, or without any hope that euer
they shall bee restored. The fall of man was also a fall
by sinne of his owne free-will, but not without the temp|ter,
neither without hope of recouery and restitution.
But the fall of the creature, was neither a fall of sinne, nor
of their owne will, but a casting of them downe against
their will from their originall state, yet not without hope to
be deliuered. Miserable in the highest degree are Apostate
Angels, who of their owne free-will without an exteriour
tempter, haue deserted their first habitation, and cast them|selues
into remedilesse condemnation. Miserable in the se|cond
degree are reprobate men, who haue fallen of their
owne free-will, suppose prouoked by an exteriour tempter,
and shall neuer be pertaker of the restitution of the sonnes
of God. But herein hath the Lord magnified his mercy to|wards
vs, that where wee fell with Angels, and reprobate
men, yet we are restored without them. The consideration
of our fall should humble vs, for in it wee are worse than
the creatures; they haue fallen from their glory, but not with
their owne will; we are fallen from ours, and we cannot ex|cuse
our selues, but it was with our will: Againe, the hope
of our restitution should greatly comfort vs, considering
that the Lord hath vouchsafed that mercy vnto vs, which he
hath denyed vnto others.</P>
<P>Further we are taught here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We should blame our selus when we are cross<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d by the cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ature.</NOTE> so oft as we are crossed by

his mercy toward vs, that hee hath not onely giuen to
our selues a liuely hope of full deliuerance, but also for our
greater comfort hath extended the same toward the creature

this hope, as we said before, that restitution promised in the
Gospell, vvas neuer preached vnto them: wee read that
sometime they haue giuen this confession, that Iesus is the
sonne of God, but they neuer sent out a petition to him for
mercy; for they haue receiued within themselues an irreuo|cable
sentence of condemnation, and they know certainly
that mercilesse iudgement abides their wilfull and malitious
Apostasie; and reprobate men in like manner, haue no hope
of any good thing abiding them after this life: and there|fore
vve are so much the more to magnifie Gods mercy
toward vs, vvho by Grace hath put a difference betweene
vs and them, vvhere there was none by Nature, and hath not
onely giuen to vs our selues a liuely hope of restitution, but
also for our sakes hath made the creatures that vvere cur|sed

The Psalmist in that same place expones the word
of perishing, by the word of changing, what this changing

that wee are not to thinke that they shall perish as concer|ning

thankfulnesse: whatsoeuer Grace wee haue receiued wee
should returne both the praise and the vse of it to him who
<PB N="268" REF="100">
gaue it; as the waters by secret conduits come from the Sea,
returne againe openly into it, through the troughes, so that
all men may see the returning, albeit they saw not the com|ming:
so that Grace which the Lord by his Spirit secretly
conuayes to the godly, doth againe publikely returne vnto
him by prayse and well doing. And thirdly, it doth teach
vs diligence in prayer; if we desire encrease of Grace, vve
should seeke it from him of vvhom vve haue the beginning,
and vse all the meanes, such as hearing, reading, praying,
keeping of a good conscience, by which Grace may grovv,
and be intertayned in vs.</P>
<P>The next thing we obserue is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No plenitude but first fruits of the Spirit haue we now.</NOTE> that in this life we receiue
not the plenitude and fulnesse of Grace, but onely the first
fruits thereof. The vse of this is, first to comfort the children
of God, who are oftentimes discouraged with the sense and
feeling of their owne wants. It is one of Sathans stratagems
to try those by the rule of perfection, who are yet but in
the state of proficients,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore are we not to think that we haue no grace, be|cause we haue but beginnings</NOTE> and we had neede to beware of it.
Shall I giue that vantage to the aduersary, as to thinke I
haue no faith, because it is weake? or I haue no loue, be|cause
it is little: or no sanctification, because it is but in a be|ginning?
No, but I will so hunger and thirst for more grace,
that I will still giue thankes for the grace I haue receiued;
for here vve haue no fulnesse, our greatest measure is as
the first fruits, in respect of that which is to come.</P>
<P>On the other side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This comfort vainly abused by prophane men.</NOTE> because euery comfort vvhich is giuen
to the godly, is turned by prophane contemners and moc|kers,
into an occasion and nourishment of sinne: they are to
know this comfort belongs not vnto them: It is a common
thing to them to excuse the want of all Grace. O it is but
a small grace vvhich in this life is communicated to the best,
and they thinke their sinnes are well inough couered, by this
that all men are sinners, as if there were no difference be|tweene
sinne tyrannizing in the wicked, and captiued in the
the godly, or as if beginnings of Grace in the regenerate
did not seperate them in regard of conuersation from the
<PB N="269" REF="100">
vnregenerate who are void of all Grace. Let them therefore
know that the Spirit of God vvhom the godly receiue, is
not onely called the first fruits, the earnest, and the witnesse
of God, but also the seale and signet of the liuing God. As
a seale leaues in the waxe that similitude and impression of
the forme which is in it selfe; so the Spirit of God commu|nicates
his owne image to all those whom he seales against
the day of redemption, hee makes them nevv and holy crea|tures.
And this conuinces carnall professors of a lye, vvho
say they haue receiued the first fruites of the Spirit, notwith|standing
that their vvorks be wicked and vncleane: they may
rather if they would tell the truth, say as those who being
demaunded vvhether they had receiued the holy Ghost or
no, answered we know not vvhether there be an holy Ghost
or no: so may they instead of bragging of the first fruits
of the Spirit, say in truth we knovv not vvhat yee call the
first fruits of the Spirit.</P>
<P>And thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Lord giues vs not in this life the principall, as well as the earnest.</NOTE> out of this description vve may gather, that
albeit we haue no more but the first fruits of the Spirit, yet
are they sufficient to assure vs, that hereafter vve shall enioy
the whole Masse. In two respects it is customable to men to
giue an earnest penny in buying and selling, either when
the summe is greater than they are able to pay for the pre|sent,
or when the thing bought is of that nature, that it can|not
presently be deliuered: but betweene the Lord and vs
there is no buying nor selling, he giues freely vnto vs, both
the earnest and the principall, but first the one, and then the
other; not that the Lord is vnable to pay presently all that
he hath promised, but because the principall is of that na|ture,
that it cannot be receiued, till we be prepared for it.
As the husbandman must sow and tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y with patience till
the haruest come, wherein he may sheare: as the warriour
must fight before he obtaine the victory; and the wrestler
receiues not his crowne till hee haue ouercome, neither
doth he that runnes in a race obtaine the prise, till he haue
finished it: so must the Christian, in all these be exercised,
<PB N="270" REF="101">
before that the Lord possesse him in the promised king|dome
of his sonne Christ Iesus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What comfort we haue now in the earnest and first fruits of the Spirit.</NOTE></P>
<P>And though payment of the principall for a time be
delayed, yet for our comfort, the earnest and first fruits are
presently deliuered vnto vs, the Lord so dealing with vs as
he delt with Israell in the Wildernesse&punc; when he caused the
twelue spies to bring with them from the riuer of <HI>Eschol,</HI> a
branch of the Vine tree, so full of the clusters of grapes,
that it was borne betweene two vpon a tree, together with
the figges, and pomegranats, and other fruits of that land:
for no other end, but that Israell tasting of the first fruits of
Canaan might be prouoked to a more earnest desire there|of,
as also to assure them that the Lord who had giuen them
the beginnings, would also put them in possession of the
whole, according to his promise: euen so the Lord Iesus
who hath gone before vs to our heauenly Canaan, not to
view it onely, but to take possession thereof in our name,
hath sent downe vnto vs some of the first fruites thereof,
that we may taste them, such as peace of Conscience, and
ioy of the Spirit, that by proofe of the small beginnings,
we may knovv vvhat excellent comfort is laid vp in store
for vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two effects which the Spi|rit workes in the godly, first a sense of their miserie for which they sigh.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>We sigh in our selues.</HI> Here followes now the two effects
of the Spirit, which he vvorkes in them vvho haue receiued
it. The first, is a sense of their present misery, which causes
them to sigh vnto God for deliuerance, and hee sayth, they
sigh within themselues, to teach vs that it is not an hipocri|ticall
and counterfait, but an inward and godly sorrow,
vvhich the Spirit workes in the children of God. Which I
doe not so speake as if I did condemne those sighes which
breake forth without; for sometime the griefe of hart is so
aboundant in the godly, that not onely it breakes out in
sighing and mourning, but in strong crying to God also,
but to restraine the hipocrisie of others, who make a faire
shew of that in the flesh, which is not in the Spirit. True
religion striues rather to be approued of God, than seene of
<PB N="271" REF="101">
men: one sigh proceeding from the heart, is a louder crying
in the eares of the Lord of hosts, and more forcible to moue
him, than the noise of all the shooting Priests of <HI>Baal,</HI> when
they are gathered together into one.</P>
<P>We are therefore more deepely to consider this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sighing and mourning goe before comfort</NOTE> that the
Spirit of God first teacheth vs to figh and mourne for our
present misery, before he comfort vs with a constant hope
of deliuerance. If now we mourne not, wee shall not reioyce
hereafter: it is onely mourners whom God hath marked in
the fore-head, to saue from the wrath to come: such a con+tinuall
mourner was <HI>Dauid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 6. 6.</NOTE> who protests that in the night
he watered his couch with teares, and in the day mingled
his cuppe therewith:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 3. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Iob</HI> in like manner, <HI>my sighing</HI> (said
he) <HI>comes before my eating.</HI> The Saints of God are not asha|med
to professe that of themselues, which the mockers of
this age esteeme a womanly affection; there is nothing to
be found among them, but eating, drinking, singing, and a
contracting of one sin after another, with carnall reioycing;
but woe be vnto them that now laugh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 6. 25.</NOTE> for assuredly they
shall weep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t. 5. 4.</NOTE> the end of their ioy shall be endles mourning and
gnashing of teeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 27. 38.</NOTE> they shall shed teares abundantly with
<HI>Esau,</HI> but shall finde no place for mercy.</P>
<P>Let vs therefore goe to the house of mourning with the
Godly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maries teares pleased Christ better than the Pharises deli|cates.</NOTE> rather than to the banquetting houses of the wicked,
reioycing in their sinfull pleasures. At one time <HI>Simon</HI> the
Pharise gaue our Sauiour a dinner, and <HI>Mary</HI> who had
beene a sinner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 7. 38. verse. 44.</NOTE> brought him the sacrifice of a contrite heart,
and the Lord esteemed more of her teares, than of the Pha|ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ies
delicates. No banquet pleaseth the Lord Iesus so well
as a banquet of teares, poured from a truely penitent heart.
The Lord is said to gather the teares of his children, and
keepe them in a bottell, thereby to tell vs that they are pre|tious
in his sight: for hee is not like fooles who gather into
their treasures, things which are vaine and needlesse. But
alas, how shall hee gather that which wee haue not scatte|red?
where are our teares, the witnesses of our vnfained
<PB N="272" REF="102">
humiliation before God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The deplorable hardnes of hart in this age, that cannot mourne</NOTE> The hardnesse of hart hath ouer|growne

learne without intermission to fight against it.</P>
<P>For herein is our case so much the more pittifull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seing wee haue so many causes of mourning: without vs, the troublesome estate of Gods Church.</NOTE> that ha|uing

<P>The causes of mourning within vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of mour+ning, within vs, our manifold sinnes.</NOTE> are partly our sinnes,
partly our manifold tentations. As our sinnes are contracted
with pleasure, so are they dissolued with godly sorrow. It is
the best medicine, which is most contrary to the nature of
the disease: our sinne is a sicknesse, wherein there is a carnall
delight to doe that which is forbidden, and it is best cured
by repentance, wherein there is a spirituall displeasure and
sorrowing for the euill which wee haue done: this mourning
for sinne lasts in the godly so long as they liue in the body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7. 24.</NOTE>
yea, those same sinnes which God hath forgiuen, and put
<PB N="273" REF="102">
out of their affection, are still in their remembrance for their
humiliation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kin. 20. 23</NOTE> so that with Godly <HI>Ezechia</HI> they recount all

the matter of their ioy, but now being by grace remoued
out of the affection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And our mani|fold tentations.</NOTE> it becomes the matter of their sorrow.</P>
<P>The other cause of our mourning, is our manifold ten|tations:

vs, that we can hardly tell which of them we haue most
cause to feare. On euery side Sathan besets vs with tentati|ons,

Againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The day of death and day of resurrection earnestly wai|ted for by the godly.</NOTE> wee are to marke that the Godly are described

specially there are two dayes, for which the Children of
God are said to wait; the first, the day of death, wherin they
goe to the Lord: the second, the day of appearing wherein
the Lord shall come vnto them: they soiourne in the body,
more weary of it, then <HI>Dauid</HI> was of his dwelling in the

dart of death surely ouer-takes them. Miserable are they

death, than in any certaintie which they haue of eternall

the nature of hope, vvhich is of things that are not seene, nor
as yet come to passe.</P>
<P>This place is abused by the aduersaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This verse abu|sed to impugne Iustification by Faith.</NOTE> to impugne the
doctrine of iustification by Faith: we are saued say they by
hope, and therefore not by faith onely. That wee may see
the weaknesse of their reason, we vvill first compare Faith
and Hope, in that relation which they haue to Christ: se|condly
in that relation vvhich they haue mutually among
themselues. For we deny not, that Faith, Hope, and Loue,
each one of them hath a place in the worke of our saluation,
<PB N="279" REF="105">
but the question betweene vs and them is, concerning the
right placing of them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith and hope compaired in their relation to Christ.</NOTE> First, then it is certaine, that both
faith and hope looke vnto Christ; Iesus Christ and that
which he hath conquered vnto vs, is the obiect of them
both, but diuersly: for faith enters vs into a present posses|sion
of Christ and his benefits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 3. 36.</NOTE> <HI>he that beleeueth in me</HI> (saith
our Sauiour) <HI>hath eternall life,</HI> hee saith not onely hee shall
haue it, but also that presently hee hath it: Hope againe
lookes for a future possession of Christ, which shall bee
much more excellent, than that which presently we inioy;
for the possession of Christ which now I haue by Faith is
imperfect and mediate;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 9. 10.</NOTE> by Faith I know Christ but in part,
by Faith I apprehend him but in part also: and this posses|sion
I haue it mediately, to wit, by the meanes of the Word
and Sacraments; but my hope directs mee to looke for a
mroe excellent possession of Christ, within a short while,
in whom I shall enioy much more than now by the know|ledge
of my Faith I can see in him, or yet by apprehension
of my Faith I can comprehend of him. And this is that per|fect
and immediate possession of Christ which by Hope
we looke for.</P>
<P>Now as for their mutuall relation among themselues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith and hope compared in their mutuall relation be|tweene them|selues.</NOTE>
Faith is of things past, present, and to come; Hope is onely
of things to come: Faith is more largely extended than
Hope: wee hope for nothing which wee beleeue not, but
something wee beleeue for which wee hope not: wee be|leeue
that the paines of hell abide the wicked, but we hope
them not; for hope is an expectation of good to come, they
may fall vnder feare, but come not vnder hope. Againe,
Faith is the mother of Hope; for of that imperfect know|ledge,
and apprehension of Christ which I haue by Faith,
there ariseth in mee an hope and expectation of a better:
Hope againe, is not onely the daughter of Faith, but the
conseruer and nourisher of Faith, the piller that vnder|props
it, when it faints; for in this life we are beset with so
manifold tentations, the worke of God seeming oftentimes
<PB N="280" REF="106">
contrary to his word, and things appearing to fall out other|wise
than the Lord hath promised, that our Faith thereby
is wonderfully daunted, and therefore hath neede to be sup|ported
by Hope, which teacheth alwayes with patience to
depend vpon Gods truth, and to looke for a better. As for
example,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 50. 15.</NOTE> the Lord saith, <HI>Call vpon me in the day of thy trou|ble,
I will heare thee, and deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me,</HI>
according to this promise the Christian calling vpon God
and yet not finding deliuerance, his Faith begins to faint,
but then Hope comes in, and succoureth Faith, and her
counsell is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habak. 2. 3.</NOTE> <HI>the vision is for an appointed time, at last it shall
speake and not lye: though it tarry, waite, for it shall surely
come and not stay:</HI> and this Faith being strengthened by
Hope, continues her prayers to God, vntill she obtaine her
promised and desired deliuerance.</P>
<P>And of this it is euident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The right place assigned to eue|ry one of these three, Faith, Hope, &amp; Loue, in the worke of saluation.</NOTE> in what sense it is that the Apo|stle
saith, wee are saued by Hope, to wit, because by it wee
are vpholden in trouble: for he is not here disputing of the
manner of our Iustification (which he hath done before) but
discoursing of those comforts which wee haue to sustaine vs
in affliction. If ye aske by which of these three, Faith, Hope,
and Loue, we are iustified, that is, by which of them we ap|prehend
Christs righteousnes offered to vs in the Gospell,
the Apostle hath answered already, wee are iustified by
Faith? If yee demand which of these three chiefely sustaines
vs in affliction: the Apostle here telleth you, that when
Faith is weake, Hope saues vs that wee dispaire not: and if
yee demaund which of these three declares vs to bee men
iustified by Faith in Christ, the Apostle telleth you, wee
must declare our Faith by good workes; for Faith worketh
by Loue: these are the right places, which these three excel|lent
graces of the Spirit hath in the worke of our saluation,
and they goe so ioyntly together, that they cannot bee
sundred.</P>
<P>When we say that a man is iustified by Faith onely, we
doe not therefore make the iustified man to be without
<PB N="281" REF="106">
Hope and Loue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The doctrine of Iustification by Faith onely, takes not away Hope &amp; Loue.</NOTE> For albeit in the action of the apprehen|ding
and applying of Christs righteousnesse, Faith onely
workes, for which wee say truely wee are iustified by Faith
onely, yet Hope and Loue haue other actions pertayning
to saluation, necessarily requisite in the iustified man. And
this doth cleare vs of that false calumnie wherewith the ad|uersaries
doe charge vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calumnie of the aduersary concerning this confuted.</NOTE> as if we did teach, that Faith might
be without Hope or Loue, because wee affirme that wee are
iustified by Faith onely. I say most truely, when I say that
among all the members of the body, the eye onely sees, but
if any man collect of my speach, that the eye is onely in the
body, without eare or hand, he concludes wrong. For albeit
in the facultie of seeing I say the eye onely sees, yet doe I
not for that seperate it from the communion of the rest of
the members of the body. In the Sunne heat and light goe
inseperably together; of these two it is the heat onely that
warmes vs, doe I therefore say that the heat is without the
light? Among all the graces of the Spirit, when I say
that Faith onely iustifies, I doe but point out the proper
action of Faith, but doe not therefore seperate it from
Hope and Loue. So farre iniurious are the aduersaryes of
the truth vnto vs, when they accuse vs for maintayning a
Faith which is without Hope, and doth not worke by Loue,
which we neuer affirmed.</P>
<P>Of this now it is euident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hope of a Christian is a strong thing, depending on sure warrants.</NOTE> that the Hope of a Christian
must be very strong, seeing it sustaines him in trouble; it is a
pillar that sustaynes the whole building, and a most sure

<P>_THe Apostle here concludes not onely this his
last purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conclusion of his first prin|cipall argument of comfort a|gainst the crosse</NOTE> wherein hee hath taught vs, that
the very nature of hope leades vs to looke for
some better thing which is to come, but also he
concludes his first principall argument of com|fort;
making this to bee the end of all, that it becomes vs
with patience to abide our promised deliuerance. And al|beit
for memories sake wee haue reduced all that hee hath
spoken, into one principall argument, yet may wee see how
vnder this one, many particular reasons are heaped vp toge|ther,
tending all to this one conclusion; that we should abide
it with petience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixe seuerall reasons of com|fort, lurking vnder this one.</NOTE> First, wee haue heard that the nature of
our sufferings are so changed, that they are now made suf|ferings
with Christ. Secondly, that the end of them is to be
glorified with Christ. Thirdly, that the glory to come doth
farre exceede in waight and eternitie our present sufferings.
Fourthly, that the creatures haue a feruent desire of the re|uelation
of that glory. Fiftly, that they also who haue re|ceiued
the first fruites of the Spirit, are wearie of their pre|sent
misery, and waite for ther edemption to come. And last,
that in all our troubles wee are saued, and sustained with the
hope of that which is to come, and not with a present
<PB N="285" REF="107">
possession of that which wee would haue. In all these re|spects,
it becomes vs not onely to be of good comfort for
the present, but also patiently to looke for a better. The A|postle
brings in his conclusion vpon his last argument, but we
are to consider that it hath an eye vnto all that goes before,
and that euery one of those reasons aforesaide, serueth to
strengthen this conclusion, that if wee hope for that which
is to come, then will we with patience abide for it.</P>
<P>We haue first to marke a difference betweene the Chri|stian
and the Worldling:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The worldlings comfort is in things that are seene, the Chri|stians not so.</NOTE> the Worldling hath his affection
on things which are seene, hee cannot mount aboue them;
hee hath receiued his consolation on earth; his portion is
here, and he possesseth his best things in this present life. It
is farre otherwise with the Christian, for in his affection he
transcends euery thing which is subiect to sense, hee is not
now a possessor, but an expectant by hope of his best
things, hee hath them not <HI>in re,</HI> but <HI>in spe:</HI> therefore may he
say to the Worldling, as our Sauiour saide to his Kinsmen,
<HI>your times is alway, but my time is not yet come.</HI> The Christian
is that good husbandman, who hath more comfort in that
seed, which he hath sowen, and couered with earth that he
seeth it not, than he hath in that, which he sees lying before
his eyes in the barne, for hee knowes that the one, at the
last, shall render him manifold greater encrease, than the
other.</P>
<P>It is not an vnpleasant Allegorie which <HI>Augustine</HI> makes
vpon these words of our blessed Sauiour.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augustines</HI> Allegory on the words of Christ.</NOTE> <HI>If a Some aske
bread of any of you that is a Father, will he giue him a stone?
or if hee aske a fish,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 11. 11.</NOTE> <HI>will he giue him a Serpent? or if hee aske an
egge, will he giue him a Scorpion.</HI> The Lord Iesus being the
highest Doctor that euer taught, doth teach in the lowest,
applying himselfe to our capacitie; by homely similitudes
of earthly things, hee labours to bring vs in all his doctrine
to the knowledge of things heauenly: I know that the end
of these parables is to confirme vs in this assurance, that if
we seeke good things from the Lord, we shall obtaine them,

day of death, vvhich vvill be to thee a day of darknesse, and
dolefull displeasure, which shall swallovv vp with one gape,
not onely the sense, but also the remembrance of all thy
former delights?</P>
<P>Where then are your pleasures O worldlings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worldlings haue no present pleasures: such as are gone are lost, such as are to come or vncertaine.</NOTE> vvherein
yee reioyce? present pleasures yee haue not, those vvhich
are past are vaine and comforts you not, and those which

are ye deceiued? yee looke for a faire day and a foule comes
vpon you: ye looke for continuance of health, and sicknes
vnawares seases vpon you: yee comfort your selues vvith
the hope of a good successe of your affaires, and an euill
successe ouerturnes incontinent all the counsels of your hart:
thus the good for which yee looke to come, in your owne
experience you finde it deceiues you. Call not therefore
any more vpon vs to follow you, and to drinke with you of
your perishing pleasures, wee haue had a proofe of yours,
and found them to bee vanitie; but if yee will, come and
take a proofe of ours, will you taste of those delicates
vvhereunto God hath called vs? will you eate of the fruit
that growes vpon the tree of life, discouered by the Gospell,

shall breed you peace, and peace shall breed you ioy in the
holy Ghost, and these shall in such sort delight you, that in
regard of them, your soule shall loath all your former vaine
pleasures vvherein you delighted before.</P>
<P>Of this we may see further, that as Faith procreates hope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impatience in trouble pro|ceeds from the want of Hope.</NOTE>
so hope procreates Patience: so that the want of Patience
in trouble bewrayes the want of Hope, What made <HI>Saul</HI>
who in his first beginning draue Witches out of the land,
in his latter end to make his refuge to them? surely because
all hope had failed him that the Lord would answere him
any more. When Samaria was besieged and straited vvith
Famine, as long as <HI>Iehoram</HI> had any hope hee waited vvith
patience vpon the word of <HI>Elisha,</HI> that there should be
great plenty shortly in Samaria, but when by the womans
<PB N="289" REF="108">
complaint he vnderstood that the Famine was encreast to
that height, that his subiects were forced to eate their chil|dren,
his hope failed him, and hee concludes to attend no
longer vpon the Lord, but vowes in his impatience to cut
off the head of <HI>Elisha.</HI> Thus the cause of all impatience in
trouble, that driues men to seeke deliuerance by wicked
and vnlawfull meanes, is onely the want of hope.</P>
<P>Againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Licentiousnes in prosperitie proceeds from the want of hope.</NOTE> if yee looke to those who in prosperitie layes
downe the raynes of their affections with all licentiousnesse
to goe after their desired pleasures, yee shall find the onely
cause thereof is the want of hope, <HI>he that hath</HI> (saith Saint
<HI>Iohn) this hope in himselfe that he shall see God purges himselfe,
euen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s God is pure.</HI> And this our Sauiour teacheth vs more
clearely, in the Parable of that seruant who because hee
thought within himselfe that his Maister would not come,
began to beat his fellowes instead of feeding them. So that
the ground of all the Atheisme of our time, is pointed out
to be the want of hope: there is no sinne committed but
through impatience, all proceedes of this, that mans vnre|generate
and proud nature cannot contayne the selfe within
the limites prescribed vnto it by the Lord: he that is gouer|ned
with patience is easily kept both in peace and warre
from extremitie of affection. If any man prophane like <HI>Esau</HI>
sell his birth-right for a messe of pottage, that is, forgoe
eternall life for the perishing pleasures of this life, it is be|cause
he hath no hope; and therefore no meruaile if vvith
patience he abide not for a better, but rather in impatience
breake after his affections, to embrace those things which
are present.</P>
<P>Among all the graces of the Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Without pati|ence no grace can be preser|ued.</NOTE> this praise may be
giuen to Patience, that it is the keeper of the rest: if our
patience be not first broken, we cannot be induced&punc; to the
committing of any sinne. Sinnefull concupiscence proceeds
from the impatience of continencie; couetousnesse from this
that we are impatient of our sober estate. Therefore did

<HI>Socrates:</HI> yet cannot their patience deserue the praise of true
vertue; for neither did their suffering proceed from the Spi|rit
sanctifying their harts by Faith, without which it is im|possible
to please God, nor was the end thereof directed to
his glory; albeit as sayth the Apostle, <HI>after a sort they knew
him, yet did they not glorifie him,</HI> and though they seemed
<HI>omni virtutum genere praeclari,</HI> to excell in euery kinde of
vertue; yet herein are they conuinced to be vniust, <HI>quod dona
Dei non retulerunt ad suum authorem,</HI> that they returned not
the gifts of God to the author thereof, but rather abused
them to their owne vaine-glory; and so fayling both in the
beginning, as also in that end whereunto they should haue
beene directed, they cannot haue the praise of acceptable
vertues to God, but are rather to be accounted shadowes
of vertues, than vertue indeed. <HI>Quid enim illis cum virtutibus,

God? <HI>Certe verus philosophus est amator Dei:</HI> but the most

of God.</P>
<P>The second sort of persons excluded from the praise of
true patience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worldlings su|styning great distresse for gaine, are also excluded from the praise of true Patience.</NOTE> are worldlings: who howsoeuer they indure
very much, and sustaine great distresse in their bodyes, and
restlesse cares in their mindes, yet haue not this end propo|sed
to them, that by the good which presently they seeke
they may attaine vnto better. Our Sauiour hath recommen|ded
to vs that patience whereby we possesse our soules; hee
counts not of those sufferings, which men endure that they
may possesse things which are without them: for what is
that possession worth whereby men possesse those things
which are without them, they themselues being possessed
within of worse than themselues? They are called Lords,
and are the seruants of seruants; haue Villages, Cities and

multitudes of men vnder their commandement, and they
themselues are captiued slaues vnder the seruitude of Sathan:
but that Patience is praise worthy, whereby we possesse our
soules in patience, euen then when wee sustayne greatest
losse of things that are without vs: yet certainely all those
cares of worldlings, which causes them to endure the neces|sities
of hunger and thirst, the heat of the day, and cold of
the night, seemes to be but <HI>licitae quodammodo insaniae,</HI> that
is, lawfull and tollerable furies, if they be compared with
others.</P>
<P>This definition doth also exclude from the praise of this
excellent vertue those miserable Atheists who sustaine great
stresse and painfull labours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atheists who pine themselues to commit euill excluded from the praise of true Patience.</NOTE> that they may commit euill.
These are they of whom <HI>Salomon</HI> saith, they cannot rest vn|lesse

amica bonae conscientiae, non inimica innocentiae:</HI> as in like
manner, that losse of goods, want of rest, and enduring of

<HI>Infirmities.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our infirmities are manifold.</NOTE> So the Apostle speakes in the plurall num|ber,
because not one, but manifold are the infirmities where|unto
we are subiect: whereof there arises to vs a two-fold
warning. First, that we take heede vnto our selues, and see
where wee are weakest, to the end that there wee may
strengthen our selues. The Philistims were very carefull to
know wherein <HI>Sampsons</HI> strength lay, to the end that spoy|ling
him of his strength they might spoyle him of his life:
but Sathan by long experience knows our infirmities, and
sets vpon vs there where hee knowes that wee are weakest.
As therefore they who are besieged looke not so much vn|to
the stronger part of the wall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wee should strengthen our selues most where we are weakest.</NOTE> as vnto the weaker, that they
may strengthen it: so wisdome craues that we should looke
most narrowly to our greatest infirmities. Hee that hath
children albeit he loue them all, yet hath he most respect to
the most infirme among the; and he that hath many tene|ments
of land, hastes soonest to repayre that which is most
ruinous; and among all the members of the body, we care
most for those that are weake or wounded. Seeing Nature
hath taught vs to take heed to those things which are ours,
shall we not much more take heed vnto our selues? It is
euen a point of holy wisedome to consider where wee are
weakest, and what those sinnes are vnto which we are most
subiect, and by which Sathan hath gotten greatest vantage
against vs, that so we may take the more paynes to make
our selues strong against it.</P>
<P>And after that by prayer and spirituall exercises,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet so that we remember that the enimie re|pulsed at one place will as|sault another.</NOTE> thou
hast made thy selfe strong there where thou wast wont to

hee will goe about and seeke vantage at an other: and

imprecations against their brethren, crying for the
plagues of God vpon their neighbours, for euery small of|fence,
in stead of the blessings of God: these are like the

<P>And further we may learne here how little cause either
the Pelagian had of old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What good can we doe by Na|ture, seeing we cannot doe so much as pray for our selues.</NOTE> or the semipelagian Papists haue
now, to magnifie so farre the arme of flesh, as to affirme

make choise in things spirituall, of that which is good: for
seeing vve cannot know vvhat is good for vs, till the Spirit
teach vs, vvhat power haue vve of our selues to make choise
of it? It is true that men by the quicknesse of their naturall

to ioyne a mocking of God: for in effect thou sayest with

vncontrouled of men.</P>
<P>And so much the more let vs endeauour to attaine to this
holy disposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sonnes of Adam seeke to hide themselues from the Lord,</NOTE> because how so euer our corrupt Nature
cannot hide her crooked wayes from the Lord, yet she de|sires
and preases to doe it, and if her deeds and thoughts be
brought vnto the light, it is sore against her will: but the
children of God renued by grace, willingly presents their
hearts to God, that he should looke vpon them. And this
the Apostle points out here, when hee saith, that not onely
God knowes the heart, but that hee searches the heart.
Searching, is the inquisition of a thing which is hid and co|uered,
and imports the contrary corruption of our Nature,
vvhich seekes to hide and obscure it selfe from the Lord.
As <HI>Adam</HI> presently after his fall sought to couer his na|kednesse
with figge-tree leaues, so hath he transmitted this
heritable euill to all his posteritie, that when they haue done
wickedly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But in vaine.</NOTE> they doe what they can to couer it: but in vaine,
for the Lord is such a searcher, from whose eyes no man
can hide that for which he makes inquisition. <HI>Laban</HI> searched
the Tent of <HI>Iacob</HI> for his idols, and could not finde them
though they were there: but what the Lord searches hee
shall finde out. If <HI>Saul</HI> hide himselfe the Lord can tell the
people that he lurkes among the stuffe. As a light where
it comes makes things to be seene which were hid in dark|nesse,
so the Lord when he searches, saith he will search with
lights; to tell thee that were thy deedes neuer so secret, hee
will make them manifest. Let vs not therefore like the pro|phane
Atheists seeke to hide our secrets from the searcher,
but let vs liue as in the sight of God.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="114">
Neyther is it without great cause that the Lord passing
by other things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The heart only makes the diffe|rence between the true christi|an &amp; counter|faite.</NOTE> looketh onely to the heart, the heart being
the essentiall difference that distinguisheth a true Christian
from a counterfaite: for outward exercises of godlinesse the
hypocrite in appearance may match the holy one. Ye shall
see <HI>Cain</HI> sacrificing no lesse then <HI>Abel:</HI> yee shall see <HI>Esas</HI>
seeking the blessing with greater crying, and moe teares,
than <HI>Iacob:</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> shall confesse his sinne no lesse than
<HI>Dauid:</HI> and <HI>Ahab</HI> shall humble himselfe in dust and ashes,
more penitent like than <HI>Ezechiah:</HI> the Pharisee shall be
more abundant in fasting and giuing of almes, than the Pub|lican.
As he that doth paint a fire, may paint the colour and
the forme of the bowing flame thereof, but can no way
paint the heate thereof: so an Hypocrite can looke like a
Christian, speake like a Christian, and in outward actions
counterfait the Christian, but can neuer attaine to the Chri|stians
heart: therefore is it that the Lord most of all delights
in the heart, and we also most of all should take heede vnto
it, to keepe it holy.</P>
<P>Beside this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is in great wisedome that God hath loc|ked vp the hart of one man from another.</NOTE> that the Lord hath locked vp the heart of
one man from another, and hath reserued the knowledge of
the heart to himselfe onely, the Lord hath done it in great
wisedome: for seeing that man diuided himselfe by sinne
from God, their hearts by nature are so discordant among
themselues, that if their hearts were as manifest to others,
as their faces, there could not be a fellowship nor societie
entertained among men. Looke how many men are in the
world, there are as many sundry iudgements and wils, euery
man hauing a kingdome in his breast, and so carryed away
with a desire of his owne super-excellencie, that hee seeketh
the aduancement of his owne will with the ouerthrow of all
others, whose will is not agreeable to his, if hee might at|taine
vnto it. Againe, the heart of man is such a bottomlesse
fountaine of wickednesse, that if it were manifested, the
world should be infected with viler abhominations, than
any that yet are knowne in it: for if the tongue which is
<PB N="311" REF="114">
but a little member of the body, when it fomes out but a
small part of that filth which abounds in the heart, be so
forcible as to corrupt the honest minds and manners of the
hearers, what should be done if the heart it selfe were laid
open, which is by nature but a stincking puddle, and filthy
store-house of all iniquitie?</P>
<P>And further for the comfort of the whole Church of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The soueraign|ty of God ouer man appears in this, that hee is vpon the se|crets of their hearts.</NOTE>
and euery member thereof, let vs marke the soueraigntie of
our God ouer all his creatures in these two, that not onely
hee is vpon their secrets whether they will or not, for hee
sits in their hearts, but also hath soueraign commandement
ouer them, so that he can when he wil, &amp; will when his glory
requires, eyther take their hearts vtterly from them, or turne
their owne hearts against themselues, as domestick enimies
to torment them. And as for the first, it is manifest out of
this place, that the Lord sitteth vpon the secret counsell of
the wicked; for hee searcheth the heart. It was a great dis|couragement
to <HI>Benhadad</HI> King of Aram, that the secret
conclusion, which hee laid with his captaines in his cabinet
counsel, concerning the ordering of his battels against Israel,
were discouered as they were concluded, by <HI>Elisha</HI> the Pro|phet,
vnto the King of Israell, and who reueiled them to
<HI>Elisha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> but the Lord our God, who sits as moderator in the
counsell of the wicked, whether they will or not to ouerrule
their determinations, &amp; direct them to his owne end, which
is his glory, and good of his Church. Let our enimies
then take counsell, and conspire together as they will, hee
that doth sit in the heauens shall haue them in derision. The
counsell of the Lord shall stand, and what hee hath decreed
shall onely come to passe: let vs therefore rest in him.</P>
<P>It were good for men to consider this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Man hath but his hart to hold him vp, &amp; God can take it f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o~ him, when hee will.</NOTE> that albeit man
be sustained and vpholden by his owne heart, so that no o|ther
thing can help him if it faile him, yet it is in the Lords
power to doe with it what hee will: how oft haue we seene
that the Lord being angry at man, passing by all the mem|bers
of his body, and leauing them whole and sound, hath
<PB N="312" REF="115">
stricken the heart with such terrours, that most valiant men
hauing eyes could not see, hauing a tongue could not speak,
hauing hands could not strike to defend themselues, and
hauing feete could not doe so much as runne away, their
heart being taken from them by God, they are left in a strait
and comfortlesse estate. But farre more miserable are they,
when the Lord turnes their owne hearts against themselues,
and makes them a terrour to themselues. A fearefull exam|ple
whereof wee haue in <HI>Belshazzar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 4. 6.</NOTE> who seeing nothing
without him, but the figure of a hand which stirred him
not, was so stricken and pursued with his owne heart with|in
him, that his flesh trembled, his countenance waxed pale,
his knees smote one against another. If man considered this,
he would be loath to prouoke the Lord vnto anger, seeing
hee can neyther sustaine the wrath of God nor eschew it.</P>
<P>Moreouer wee are taught here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We haue neede of great reue|rence in praier, seeing we speak to him who searcheth the heart.</NOTE> seeing our Prayer is a
conference with him who searcheth the heart, that we should
alway pray with our heart, for otherwise if wee draw neere
him with our lips our heart being farre from him, hee will
curse vs as deceiuers, that hauing a male in our flock, doe sa|crifice
a lame thing vnto the Lord: that is, in stead of the
seruice of our hearts, doe offer vnto him the seruice of our
lips. The Lord hath no delight in the sacrifice of fooles, who
are rash with their mouth to vtter a thing before him, not
considering that hee is in heauen, and they are vpon earth,
the mouth may reach to men who are beside vs, the heart
onely may reach to God who is aboue. It was a very godly
protestation that <HI>Dauid</HI> made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 139. 23</NOTE> <HI>Try me O Lord, and prooue
my thoughts in the night,</HI> and see if at any time I haue spoken
that to thee with my mouth, which I haue not thought with

yet is it that holy sinceritie whereat wee should ayme in all
our prayers, so to speake vnto God that our conscience
may beare vs record that we lye not, and that we haue spoken
nothing with our mouth, which we haue not thought vvith
our heart.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="115">
We are therefore for the right ordering of our prayers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things to be obserued in Prayer.</NOTE>
to take heede to these three things. First, preparation before
prayer. Secondly, attention in prayer. Thirdly, reuerent <MILESTONE N="1">
thanksgiuing after prayer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">That prepara|tion go before it.</NOTE> As for the first, as <HI>Moses</HI> and
<HI>Iosua</HI> put off their shooes before they came neere the Lord,
so are we to remoue out of our hearts vncleane cogitations,
and affections, whereby we haue trode in the filth of sinne,
before we pray; for those are neuer lawfull, but most vnlaw|full
in the time of prayer. As for worldly cogitations they
are sometimes lawfull, but neuer in the time of prayer. As
<HI>Abraham</HI> vsed his Asses to serue him for the iourney, but
when he came to mount Moriah, the place of the worship,
he left them at the foot of the hill: so the thoughts of the
world are sometime tollerable, if wee vse them as seruants,
to carry vs through in our iourney, from the earth to hea|uen,
but we must not take them with vs into the holy place
wherein the Lord is to be worshipped.</P>
<P>To help vs to the preparation before prayer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motiues to preparation.</NOTE> let vs con|sider;
first that he to whom we speake is the Father of light,
and we are by nature but the children of darknes: call there|fore
vpon him in the sinceritie and vprightnesse of thine
heart; for he loues truth in the inward affections. Secondly,
he is the Father of glory, come therefore before him with
feare and reuerence, for thou art but dust and ashes. Thirdly,
he is the Father of mercy, repent thee therefore of thy
sinnes, and then draw neere with a true heart, in assurance
of Faith.</P>
<P>The second thing requisit, is attention in Prayer: the Lord <MILESTONE N="2">
to whom we speake is the searcher of the heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That there be attention in prayer.</NOTE> and there|fore
we should beware that we speake nothing to him with
our mouth, which our heart hath not conceiued. For it is a
great mockerie to the Lord to desire him to consider those
petitions which we haue not considred our selues; we scarce|ly
heare what we say our selues, and how then shall we craue
the Lord may heare vs? We finde by experience that it is
not an easie thing to gather together in one, and keepe
<PB N="314" REF="116">
vnited the powers of our soule in prayer vnto God. Sathan
knowes that the gathering of our forces is the weakening of
his kingdome, and that then we are strongest, when we are
most feruent in prayer, and therefore doth hee labour all
that hee can to slacke the earnestnesse of our affection, and
so to make vs more remisse in prayer, by stealing into our
hearts if not a prophane, at least an impertinent cogitation,
so that vnlesse we fight without ceasing against the incursi|on
of our enimie, like <HI>Abraham</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iuing away the rauening

<P><MILESTONE N="3"> And thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That after prayer therebe thanksgiuing to God.</NOTE> after thy prayer thou shouldst come away
with reuerent thanksgiuing. It is the fault of many carelesse
worshippers, they goe vnto God as men goe to a Well to
refresh them when they are thirstie; they goe to it, and their
face toward it, but being refreshed they returne with their
backe vpon it: euen so doe they sit downe to their prayers
without preparation, powre them out without attention and
deuotion, and when they haue done, goes away without re|uerent

that the Euangelist Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Ioh. 5. 18.</NOTE> <HI>hee that is borne of
God sinneth not:</HI> and in the same Epistle speaking also of
men that are regenerate and borne of God, he saith, <HI>if wee
say we haue no sinne we deceiue our selues.</HI> The Apostle Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> speaking of himselfe in one and the selfe same place,
affirmes <HI>that he did the euill which he would not,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7. 15. 17</NOTE> and yet in|continent
hee protests <HI>that it was not hee but sinne dwelling
in him.</HI></P>
<P>The resolution of this doubt will arise by considering
that in the Christian man are two men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the christian man are two men, the new and the old.</NOTE> the new man, and
the old; the one the workmanship of God, the other the
workmanship of Sathan; the one but young, little &amp; weake
in respect of the other, like little <HI>Dauid</HI> compared to the
Gyant <HI>Goliah.</HI> Yet the new man who is weakest hath this
vantage, that he is daily growing, whereas the other is daily
decaying; the life of the new man waxeth stronger and
<PB N="316" REF="117">
stronger, the life of the old man weaker and weaker, the
one tending to perfection, the other wearing to a finall
destruction.</P>
<P>Now the Lord in iudging of the Christian lookes not
to the remanents of sinne in him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God iudges of the Christian by the new man, and not by the old.</NOTE> which are daily decaying,
but to the new workmanship of his owne grace in him,
which is daily growing; according to it he esteemes, iudges,
and speakes of the Christian: from it hee giues vs these
names, as to call vs <HI>Saints, righteous, &amp;c.</HI> not counting with
vs what wee haue beene, neither yet weighing vs by the
corruption of sinnefull nature which remaines in vs, but ac|cording
to the new grace which in our regeneration hee
hath created in vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 23. 21</NOTE> <HI>He sees no iniquitie in Israell,</HI> and it is his
praise <HI>to passe by the transgressions of his heritage.</HI> But the
Christian by the contrary in iudging of himselfe, he lookes
most commonly to that whereunto the Lord lookes least,
his sinnes are euer before him, the old man is continually
in his sight, as a strong, and mightie Gyant, whose force
hee feares, whose tyrannie makes him to tremble, and by
whom hee finds himselfe detayned vnder miserable thral|dome
farre against his will, and therefore all his care is how
to subdue this tyrannie, how to quench his life, and shake
off his dominion in this warfare: hee sighes, complaines,
and cryes vnto God with the holy Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7. 24.</NOTE> <HI>O miserable
man who shall deliuer me from this body of sinne.</HI> But because
so long as this old man hath a life, hee neuer rests to send
out sinnefull motions and actions, which doe greatly greiue
the child of God, therefore is it that hee esteemes himselfe a
miserable creature, yea, and the chiefe of all sinners. Thus
yee see how it is, that God accounts his children <HI>Saints,</HI> and
they account themselues <HI>Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>Where againe Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it is to be vnderstood that he who is borne of God sinneth not.</NOTE> that <HI>hee who is borne of
God sinnes not,</HI> and yet that <HI>hee who saith he hath no sinne is a
lyer,</HI> both of these is true. <HI>He that is borne of God,</HI> that is, the
new man, <HI>sinneth not:</HI> for sure it is that all the sins which are
committed by man, are either done without the knowledge
<PB N="317" REF="117">
of the new man, his vnderstanding being as yet so weake
that he doth not know euery sinne to be sinne, or then if he
knowes them to be sinnes, they are done without his con|sent
or approbation, yea they are done sore against his will,
so that the <HI>new man</HI> in the sinnes which are done in the body
is a patient not an agent.</P>
<P>So that as an honest man captiued by violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new man liues in the bo|dy like Lot in Sodome:</NOTE> and a|gainst
his will compelled to behold wicked and abhomina|ble
deedes, which he would not so much as looke to if hee
were free: so is the new man detayned in the body as a cap|tiue,
and compelled to looke vnto that which he loues not,
that is, to the sinnefull motions, vnruly lusts and affections
of his corrupt nature, whereunto he consents not, but pro|tests
against them, and for their sake becomes weary of so|iourning
in the body, so that <HI>Ioseph</HI> was not more weary of
his prison, nor <HI>Ieremie</HI> of his dungeon, nor <HI>Daniel</HI> of the
company of Lyons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 120. 5.</NOTE> nor <HI>Dauid</HI> more weary of his dwelling
in the tents of <HI>Kedar,</HI> than is the new man weary of his abiding
in the bodie. Hee is like <HI>Lot</HI> in Sodome, whose righteous
soule was vext day by day, by hearing and seeing the vnclean
conuersation of the Sodomites: hee is like <HI>Israel</HI> in Aegipt,
kept in most vile slauerie by the tyrannie of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> sigh|ing
and crying: he is like the godly Iewes holden in capti|uitie
in Babell, many things they saw there done to the dis|honour
of God, which they no way approued, and many
things they would haue done, that they had no libertie to
doe. So this new man perceiues many sinnefull motions and
actions brought in vpon him by a superiour power, which
are a griefe vnto him, and vexation of his spirit.</P>
<P>And this is the greatest comfort of the new man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reioycing when he doth good, grieued when he doth euill.</NOTE> that
whatsoeuer good he doth, hee doth it with ioy: and on the
contrary, euill that is done in the body it is a griefe to him
to see it, yea he protests against it, <HI>O L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rd this is not I, but
sin that dwels in me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7. 15.</NOTE> thou knowst I like it not, I allow it not,
I wish from my heart there were not done in mee any thing
that might offend thee. Onely happy, and thrice happie is
<PB N="318" REF="118">
the man, who with the holy Apostle is able to say so. Thus
yee see in what sense the Godly are sayd by the Euangelist
in one place not to sinne, and in another not to be with|out
sinne. The Lord worke this holy disposition in vs, that
the life of sinne may daily be weakned in vs.</P>

that those petitions which flow from the Spirit, are accor|ding
to Gods will, and therefore as concerning temporall
things, because wee know not absolutely what is the will of
God, whether health, or sicknesse, riches, or pouertie be
most expedient for vs, wee are to pray with a condition, if it
be his will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> but as for those things which are directly against
his will, it is a great mockery, if it be done with knowledge,
or otherwise a grose impietie to seeke them from him. It is
written of <HI>Vitellius</HI> that one of his friends asking from him
a certaine thing which hee refused, and being impatient of
the refusall, did say to him, What auaileth thy friendship to
me, if I cannot obtaine that which I craue? returned back
to his friend this answere, And what auaileth to me thy
friendship, if for thy sake I must doe that which becomes
me not? If such equitie be in a mortall man that hee vvill
not graunt an vnlawfull thing, euen to his tender friend, how
much more are we to thinke that it is in the Lord our God:
Away therefore with these cursed and abhominable sacri|fices,
as to present vnto the Lord petitions which are not
agreeable vnto his holy will.</P>
<P>And last to conclude this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Christian hath accesse to the priuie cha~|ber of the great king euer when he pleaseth.</NOTE> that wee may be encouraged
to prayer, let vs consider vvhat excellent priuiledge this is,
that the Christian as oft as hee pleaseth, hath libertie to
speake vnto the Lord his God. The Persians thought it a
piece of their sillie glory not to graunt accesse easily vnto
their subiects, yea, not to those of most noble ranck; there|fore
yee see how afraid <HI>Hester</HI> the Queene was to goe in

to call vpon him, ready at all times to extend the scepter
<PB N="319" REF="118">
of his peace toward those vvho seeke him in spirit and

and rise at midnight to call vpon him, thou shalt find him,
euen then waiting vpon thee, <HI>Inuenire potes, praeuenire non

his wayes past finding out?</HI> His glory is great when he vvorks

without meanes, but then his glory shines most brightly
when he workes by contraries.</P>
<P>It was a great worke that hee opened the eyes of the

spittle and clay, meanes meeter to put out the eyes of a seeing

in the first creation, causing light to shine out of darknesse;
so also in the worke of redemption, for by cursed death he
brought happy life, by the crosse he conquered the crowne,
<PB N="328" REF="123">
and through shame hee went to glory. And this same order
the Lord still keepeth in the worke of our second creation,
which is our regeneration, hee casts downe, that hee may
raise vp; hee kils and hee makes aliue, hee accuseth his chil|dren
for sinne, that so hee may chase them to seeke remis|sion
of sinness; hee troubleth their consciences that so hee
may pacifie them. And in a word, the meanes which hee
vseth, are contrary to the worke it self, which hee intends
to performe in his Children. Hee sent a fearefull darkenesse
on <HI>Abraham</HI> euen then when hee was to communicate vn|to

in the ende with louing affection shall hee embrace them;
hee may seeme angry at thy prayers, as hee put backe the
petitions of that woman of Canaan, but at length hee will
graunt a fauourable answere vnto them. Let vs not therfore
murmure against the Lord, by whatsoeuer meanes it please
him to worke: It is enough wee know that all the wayes of
God, euen when hee deales most hardly with his children,
are mercie, and tends to the good of those who loue him.</P>
<P>And as for Sathans stratagems,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathans strata|gems are direc|ted to the good of the godly.</NOTE> it is also out of doubt, that
they worke for the best to them who loue the Lord, not
according to his purpose indeede, but by the Lords opera|tion,
who directeth all Sathans assaults to another end then
hee intended, and trappeth him continually in his owne
snare. If vnder the Serpents shape hee deceiued <HI>Adam,</HI> vn|der
the Serpents name shall the Lord curse him, and all

vnlawfull copulation. <HI>De veneno eius fit spirituale antidotum:</HI>

of this poyson the Lord maketh a spirituall preseruatiue.</P>
<P>The experience of all the Saints of God proues this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathans accusa|tions for sinnes past are vnto the godly pre|seruatiues a|gainst sin to come.</NOTE> that
Sathan by his restlesse tentations doth destroy himselfe:
which is most euident both in his tentations for sinne com|mitted,
tending to desperation, as also in his tentations vnto
sinne, tending to presumption. Euery accusation of the
conscience for sinne past, is vnto the Godly man a preser|uatiue
to keepe him from sinne in time to come, hee rea|soning
with himselfe after this manner: If mine enimie doe
so disquiet my minde with inward terrour, for those sinnes
which foolishly I did by his entisement, why shall I hearken
to him any more, and so increase the matter of my trouble?
for what fruit haue I of all those sinnes which I did by his
instigation, but terrour and shame? and shall I looke that
this forbidden tree can render vnto me any better fruit here|after?
O what a faithlesse traitor is Sathan, he entiseth man
vnto sinne, and when hee hath done it, hee is the first ac|cuser
and troubler of man for sinne. When hee comes first
vnto vs hee is a tempter; when wee haue finished his worke
(which is sinne) hee is an accuser of vs vnto the Iudge; and
when hee returneth, hee returneth a troubler and tormen|ter
of vs, for those same sinnes which he counselled vs to doe.
Stoppe thine eare therefore O my soule, from the voyce of
this deceitfull enchanter.</P>
<P>His tentations againe vnto sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And his tenta|tions to sinne chases them to the throne of grace.</NOTE> are vnto the Godly
man prouocations that spurre him forward vnto the throne
of grace: for while as wee finde his restlesse malice pursu|ing
in vs that little sparke of spirituall life, whereby the
Lord hath quickned vs, and our owne weaknes and inabilitie
to resist him, then are wee forced with Israell in Egypt, to
sigh for the thraldome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 20. 13</NOTE> and to cry with <HI>Iehoshaphat, O Lord
our God, wee know not what to doc, but our eyes are toward
thee.</HI> And who feeleth not this, that the grace of feruent
prayer, wherein otherwise wee faint, our heart being more
ready to fall downe than the hands of <HI>Moses,</HI> vnlesse they
be supported, is greatly intended in the Children of God
<PB N="330" REF="124">
by the buffets of Sathan as is manifest in the holy Apostle.
<HI>Magna certe potestas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambr. ibid.</NOTE> <HI>quae imperat Diabolo, vt se ipse destruat,</HI>
a great power of God this is certainly, which commandeth
Sathan to destroy himselfe; <HI>Se enim destruit cum hominem,
quem tentando supplantare studet, ex infirmo fortiorem efficit,</HI>
for then doth hee destroy himselfe, when the man whom
hee seeketh to ouerthrow by his tentation, of a weake man
is made stronger, by those same meanes. Thus the Lord our
God ouer shootes Sathan in his owne bow, and cuts off the

against <HI>Israell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 29.</NOTE> with <HI>Acish</HI> King of Gath, vnder whom
he soiourned a while in the time of his banishment, the re|manent
Princes of the Philistims commanded him to goe
backe, and this they did for the worst to disgrace him, be|cause
they distrusted him, but the Lord turned it vnto him
for the best: for if hee had come forward he had been guil|tie
of the blood of <HI>Israell,</HI> specially of <HI>Saul</HI> the Lords an|nointed,
who was slaine in that battell: from this the proui|dent
mercy of God doth in such sort deliuer him that no
offence is done by <HI>Dauid</HI> to <HI>Saul,</HI> or his people, because
<HI>Dauid</HI> came not against them, neither yet could the Phili|stims
blame him, because he went backe by their own com|maund.
So a notable benefit <HI>Dauid</HI> did receiue by that same

<P>And where otherwise it pleaseth the Lord to suffer wic|ked
men to lay hand on the bodyes of his children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the body to a Christian is but as the rent|ing of Iosephs garment from him.</NOTE> yet all
they are able to doe is but like the renting of <HI>Iosephs</HI> gar|ment

though all the people of the earth were gathered together

<P>Againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the Monarch of Babell and Persia.</NOTE> when the sinnes of Israell came to that ripenes,

his owne body is pittyed of all men, as one that hath no pit|tie

both soule and body from the wrath to come, and that
worketh in thee an holy care to conforme thy selfe to the
Lord whom thou louest, and with whom thou desirest to
remaine for euer. Thus being taught to loue our selues, we
shall also learne to loue our neighbour; the ordered loue of
our selues being (as I said) that patterne, according to which
wee should loue our neighbour. <HI>Prius ita&abque; vide si nosti di|ligere

hee loued Iesus euen to the very death, with so strong
<PB N="348" REF="133">
an affection, that before the Counsell hee choosed rather
to dye for Christ, than to denye him, <HI>Licet vitam tunc mi|nime
posuit, deposuit tamen,</HI> in so much that albeit hee lost
not his life, yet hee freely laid it downe for Iesus.</P>
<P>These are thee three,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In this life wee are farre from that measure of the loue of God which should be in vs.</NOTE> whereunto wee are to aspyre in all
our life, to loue the Lord heartely; to loue him wisely; (for
inconsiderate zeale, and temerarious precipitation doth not
please him) and to loue him with so strong an affection, that
wee chose rather to suffer death than to forsake him. But
alas, how farre are wee from this holy disposition? who can
say hee hath attained to that measure of holy Loue which
the Law of God requireth in him? and therefore should vve
endeuour to grow daily in loue, earnestly praying the Lord,
that hee vvould breath by his Spirit vpon that little sparke
of heauenly life vvhich hee hath created in our hearts, that
it be not extinguished with the ashes of our corruption, but
may increase, and become a great flame to burne vp our af|fections
with such a loue of God, as may carry vp all the
powers of our soule toward him.</P>
<P>To this effect let vs meditate frequently vpon these foure
causes for vvhich wee should loue the Lord:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure medita|tions helpful to encrease in vs the loue of God.</NOTE> first, for that
which hee is in himselfe, to wit, the fountaine of all good|nesse,
the greatest and supreame good; if it be good that <MILESTONE N="1">
man would haue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We should loue him, because he himselfe is the supreame good.</NOTE> let him loue the Lord to vvhom there is
none like in goodnes, <HI>inuenito si potes aliquid pretiosius Deo,
&amp; dabitur tibi,</HI> finde out if thou canst any thing more pre|tious
than God, and it shall bee giuen thee. The Platonists
by the light of nature saw that all the pulchritude and beau|tie
which shineth in the creature vvas but <HI>spendor quidam
summi illius boni,</HI> which should transport vs in our affection
toward him from whom it came, <HI>Pulchrum coelum, pulchra
terra, sed pulchrior, qui fecit illa,</HI> the heauen and earth are
beautifull, but more beautifull is hee who made them: and
therefore as oft as any good in the creature beginneth to
steale our heart after it, let vs in our affection goe vp to the
Creator, considering that the Lord hath not made these
<PB N="349" REF="133">
beautifull or profitable creatures that we should go a whoo|ring
after them, but that by them as steps we should climbe
vp to him that made them, and rest in him.</P>
<P>The second cause that may breed the loue of God in vs,<MILESTONE N="2">
if we meditate vpon it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Because he hath first loued vs.</NOTE> that the Lord hath first loued vs:
<HI>Inuenimus eum, sed non praeuenimus,</HI> we haue found him, but
we did not preuent him; we knovv him novv, but were first
knowne of him; hee found vs first, and that euen vvhen vve
vvere enimies vnto him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernard.</NOTE> <HI>dilexit non existentes, imo resistentes,</HI>
he loued vs vvhen vve vvere not, yea vvhen vve vvere rebels
against him, and shall vve not novv being reconciled by
the death of his sonne endeauour to loue him againe.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He hath decla|red his loue by innumerable gifts already giuen vs.</NOTE> the Lord by his continuall gifts hath testified <MILESTONE N="3">
his loue to vs, he hath not beene vnto vs as a wildernesse,
or as a land of darknes: if we vvill remember and tell what
the Lord hath done to our soule, vvee shall finde vvee are
ouercome with the multitude of his mercies, and there is
none that hath deserued the loue of our hearts comparable
to the Lord. If our loue be free let vs set it vpon him who
is most worthy to be loued, and if it be venall, let vs also
giue it vnto him who hath giuen vs most for it.</P>
<P>And fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hee hath yet greater things which he hath prepared for vs to giue vs.</NOTE> it shall waken in vs the loue of God, if vve <MILESTONE N="4">
consider in our hearts what great things the Lord hath pro|mised
to giue vnto vs, euen such as the eye hath not seene;
and the eare hath neuer heard; life without death; youth
without age; light without darkenesse; ioy without sadnes;
a kingdome without a change,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de ciuit. dei. l. 10. c. 18</NOTE> and in a word, he shall then
giue vs a blessed life, <HI>non de his quae condidit, sed de seipso,</HI> not
of those things which hee hath made but of himselfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our loue to God must be tryed by the ef|fects thereof.</NOTE></P>
<P>But to returne to our former purpose, that we may know
vvhether this holy loue be created in our hearts by the spi|rit
of grace or no, we must try it by the fruits and effects of
loue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Property of Loue, it longs to obtaine tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> which is belo|ued.</NOTE> whereof novv it shall content vs to touch a few. First,<MILESTONE N="1">
it is the nature of Loue, that it earnestly desires and seekes
to obtaine that which is beloued. Hereby shalt thou knovv
whether thy affection of loue be ordered by Christ, or
<PB N="350" REF="134">
remaine as yet disordered by Sathan. The affection which
Christ hath sanctified will follow vpward, seeking to be
there where he is. Euery thing naturally returnes to the owne
originall; as the waters go downe to the deep, from whence
they came: so carnall loue powred out like water, returnes
to Sathan who begat it, and carries miserable man captiued
with it downward to the bottomles pit: but holy loue being
as a sparke of heauenly fire kindled in our hearts by the
holy Ghost, ascends continually and rauishes vs vpward to|ward
the Lord, from whom it came, not suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing vs to rest
till we inioy him.</P>
<P>Let this then be the first tryall of our loue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We loue not God if we vse not the exerci|ses of the word and prayer, see|ing by them onely we haue familiaritie with God vp|on earth.</NOTE> if wee vse
carefully those holy meanes by which vve keepe and enter|taine

loue him: and what other meanes is there by which man
vpon earth is familiar with God, but the exercises of the
word and prayer? Godly <HI>Dauid</HI> who protests in some pla|ces
that he loued the Lord, prooues it in other by the like of
these reasons, <HI>O how loue I thy law? it is my meditation con|tinually:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 97</NOTE>
and againe, <HI>I haue loued the habitation of thine house,

of the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 27. 2.</NOTE> <HI>that I may dwell in the house of my God all
the dayes of my life, to behold the beautie of the Lord, and to
visit his holy temple.</HI> As this doth serue for the comfort of
those who delight in the exercise of the word and prayer,
so doth it serue for the conuiction of those, to whom any
other place is more amiable than the labernacles of God:
an euident proofe they haue not the loue of God, because
they neglect the meanes euen when they are offered, by
which familiar accesse is gotten vnto the Lord.</P>
<P>And againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We loue not God if we long not to be with him in heauen, wher he shews his most fami|liar presence.</NOTE> because the fight we haue of God in this life,
is but through a vaile, and the tast we get of his goodnesse
is but in part, and that in the life to come the Lord will fully
embrace vs in the armes of his mercy, and kisse vs for euer
with the kisses of his mouth: therefore is it that the soule
which vnfainedly loues the Lord cannot rest content with
<PB N="351" REF="134">
that familiaritie which by the Word and Prayer it hath
with God in this life, but doth long most earnestly to be
with the Lord, where shee knoweth that in a more excel|lent
manner shee shall embrace him: whereof proceedeth
these and such like complaints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 42. 1.</NOTE> <HI>As the Hart brayeth for the

<P>But alas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How by this tryal it is found that many are void of the loue of God.</NOTE> here are wee taken in our sinnes, thou sayest
thou louest the Lord, but how is it then that thou longest
not to see him, neyther desirest thou to be with him? yea, a

of iudgement, doth terrifie and afray thee: where as other|wise
if thou didst loue him, they would be ioyfull dayes vn|to
thee: seeing in the one wee goe to him, and in the other
he commeth to vs to gather vs, and take vs thether where he
is. Surely, those men who contenting themselues with the
gifts of God in this life, thinke not long to enioy himselfe,
are but like an adulterous woman, who if so be shee pos|sesse
the goods of her husband, regards not albeit shee ne|uer
see himselfe. I confesse indeed, wee may reioyce in all
the gifts which God hath giuen vs, as in the tokens and te|stimonies
of his loue, but wee are alwayes to vse them with
this protestation, that nothing giuen vs in this life be allow|ed
vnto vs for our portion and inheritance, and that no con|tentment
euer come vnto our hearts till wee get himselfe
who gaue them. If the loue of the Corinthians made the A|postle
to say, <HI>I seeke not yours but you,</HI> how much more should
the loue of God compell vs to say vnto him, It is not thy
gifts O Lord but thy selfe I long for, thou art the portion of
my soule? if thou wouldest giue me all the workes of thine
hands, yet shall I neuer haue comfort nor contentment, ex|cept
thou dost giue me thy selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 1. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Therefore O thou whom my

and thrists for thy righteousnesse, for hee shall behold
thy face, and be filled with thine image, for in thy presence
is the fulnesse of ioy, and at thy right hand are pleasures for
euermore.</P>
<P>The second tryall of our loue is Obedience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effect of true loue is o|bedience, and a care to please the Lord.</NOTE> and an holy <MILESTONE N="2">
care in all our callings to serue and honour the Lord. Prea|chers
must be tryed by this rule, <HI>Peter, louest thou mee? feede

this, Can yee say in truth with the Godly Gouernour <HI>Da|uid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 21. 15.</NOTE>
<HI>I loue the Lord?</HI> then will yee also say with him, <HI>what
shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?</HI> how shall I shew
my loue toward him? and what shall I doe in my time for
aduancement of his glory? If thou dost loue the Lord, then
wilt thou be a nourishing Father to his Church, a carefull
aduancer of his kingdome, a wise prouisor to remoue those
stumbling blocks which hinder the course of the Gospell:
If yee loue the Lord, then will yee stand vp with <HI>Dauid,</HI>
and say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 139. 21</NOTE> <HI>Doe not I hate them O Lord that hate thee? doe not
I earnestly contend with them that rise vp against thee? surely
I hate them with vnfained hatred, as if they were mine vtter
enimies.</HI></P>
<P>If ye honour the Lord as <HI>Dauid</HI> did,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What great blessing belon|geth to them, who in their calling seeke to honour God.</NOTE> the Lord shall blesse
you as hee blessed <HI>Dauid. Dauid</HI> sware vnto the Lord, that

euen an habitation for the mightie God of <HI>Iacob.</HI> And the
Lord sweares againe vnto <HI>Dauid,</HI> that of the fruit of his bo|dy,
hee would set vp one to raigne after him. But if other|wise
there be nothing in you but a care to stablish your

God, then remember that the curse of <HI>Shebna,</HI> and not the

out of thy Tabernacle, and roote thee out of the Land of the
liuing.</HI></P>
<P>And generally all of you in your callings remember that
the value of your Christian loue must be tryed by the same
touchstone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But this age in word calleth Christ their King, but casts off his yoke.</NOTE> not by your words but by your workes. <HI>If any
loue mee</HI> (saith Iesus) <HI>let him keepe my commandements,</HI> but
here also the hypocrisie of this age is discouered: as the
Iewes called Iesus their King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 15. 10.</NOTE> and bowed their knees before
him, but spat in his face and buffetted him: so the bastard
Christians of this age call Christ their Lord, and bowe their
knees before him, yet by their sinfull life they crucifie him,
and tread his bloud of the couenant vnder their feete: they
kisse and betray him with <HI>Iudas,</HI> it is but a Scepter of reed
they allow him, for they giue him no commaundement
ouer their affections, wherefore great is the controuersie
which the Lord hath this day with the men of this gene|ration.</P>
<P>The third tryall of loue is Bountifulnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The propertie of loue is boun|tifulnesse.</NOTE> the Apostle <MILESTONE N="3">
sayth <HI>Loue is bountifull:</HI> experience proues that euery louer
bostoweth bountifully on that which hee loueth: yee loue
your bodyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 4.</NOTE> and therefore largely bestow vpon them to
feede them, and cloth them, yea, with excessiue apparrell;
yee loue your Children, and lets them want no needfull
thing for them; yea, yee loue your beasts, and spares not to
bestow largely vpon them: onely you say you loue the
Lord, but wherein are yee bountifull toward him? It is true
that in nothing can a man be profitable to the Almightie,
but are there not workes commaunded vs, which should so
shine before men, that by them our heauenly Father may
be glorified? though workes can be no merits, yet are they
your witnesses, and what haue yee done to remaine when
yee are dead as witnesses of your loue toward the Lord?
Though your goodnesse extend not to the Lord, yet where
<PB N="354" REF="136">
is your delight that should be on his Saints and excellent
ones vpon earth? where is your compassion and loue toward
the brethren? are not the men of this age like vnto that fig-tree
which had faire leaues, but not so much as one figge to
giue vnto Iesus in his hunger, <HI>hauing the shew of godlinesse
but haue denyed the power therof,</HI> yeelding words inough but
no fruits to adorne the glorious Gospell of our Lord Iesus.
Of these and many moe if wee might insist in them, it is
manifest that all haue not the loue of God in their hearts,
who this day pretend it.</P>
<P>The last tryall of Loue which novv we bring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The last is rea|dines to suffer for his cause.</NOTE> is readi|nesse <MILESTONE N="4">
to suffer affliction for the cause of God. The Apostles
being beaten for preaching in the name of Iesus, instead of
mourning, departed reioycing that they were counted wor|thy
to suffer for Christs sake, and all because they loued him.
For the loue of <HI>Rahel</HI> seauen yeeres of hard seruitude see|med
vnto <HI>Iacob</HI> but a short space. For the loue of <HI>Dinah
Sichem</HI> willingly sustayned the circumcision and cutting of
his flesh: much more to him in whose heart abounds the
loue of the Lord, vvill bitter things become sweet, and hard
things easie. This Loue hath made the holy Martyres step
out of their owne element into the fire, with greater ioy and
willingnesse, then worldlings haue when they fit downe to
their banquetting tables to refresh them, or lyes downe in
their beds to rest them. The Apostle who suffered all sorts
of affliction for the Gospell, giues this for a reason, that the
loue of Iesus constrayned him. Thus much concerning the
effects of holy loue, by which we are to make sure our cal|ling,
and consequently our election, for our euerlasting
comfort.</P>
<P><HI>Euen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">them that are called according to his purpose.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A confirmatio~ of his third and last argument of comfort.</NOTE> Hi|therto
the Apostle hath summarily set downe his third prin|cipall
argument of comfort: and now in the end of this
verse he shortly breakes vp the confirmation thereof, which
is this: they who loue God are called according to his pur|pose,
therefore all things must work for the best vnto them.
<PB N="355" REF="136">
The necessitie of this reason shall appeare if we consi|der
that the Lord cannot be frustrated of his end. Those
whom the Lord in his immutable purpose hath ordayned to
glory, and whom according to that purpose he hath called
in time, how can it be but all things must worke vnto their
good? for the working prouidence of God which is the
executer of his purpose, doth so ouer-rule all incidents which
fall out in the world, and doth so gouerne all secondary and
inferiour causes, that of necessitie they are directed to that
end, whereunto the supreame cause of all, to wit, the purpose
and will of God hath ordayned them. This is shortly set
downe in these words, and more largely explaned in the two
verses following. It is the last reason of comfort, and the
highest: for now the Apostle leades vs out of our selues,
and sets vs vpon that rocke which is higher than wee, hee
carries vs by the hand as it were out of the earth vp into
heauen, and lets vs see how our saluation is so grounded in
Gods eternall purpose, that no accident in the world can
change it.</P>
<P>We haue here then three things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort, that the ground of our saluation is in God, the tokens thereof in our selues.</NOTE> euery one of them depen|ing
vpon another: the loue of God, flowing from the calling
of God, and the calling of God, comming from the purpose
of God: vnto which the Apostle here drawes vs, that vve
casting our anchor within the vaile, and resting in the Lords
immutable purpose, may haue comfort in all our present
tentations. It is most expedient for the godly to marke this,
that our manifold changes doe not interrupt our peace:
let vs consider that the Lord hath in such sort dispensed
our saluation, that the ground thereof is laid in his owne
immutable purpose, but the markes and tokens thereof
are placed in vs after our calling: the markes and tokens are
changeable, like a wee our selues in whom they are, are
changeable; but the ground holds fast, being laid in that vn|changeable
God in whom falles no shadow of alteration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 46.</NOTE>
<HI>I am God and am not changed:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 10.</NOTE> <HI>My sheepe none can take out
of my hand:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2.</NOTE> <HI>The counsell of the Lord shall stand, and his
<PB N="356" REF="137">
foundation remaines sure.</HI> It is true that the tokens of election
cannot be fully taken away from any that is effectually cal|led;
nay not in the greatest desertion, yet haue they in vs their
owne intention and remission. And this should comfort vs
against our daily vicissitudes and changes, when wee feele
that our Faith doth faint, our life languishes, our hope ho|uers,
and we are like to sincke in the tentation with <HI>Peter,</HI>
and our feeble hands fall downe with <HI>Moses,</HI> yet let vs not
dispaire; no change in vs can alter Gods vnchangeable pur|pose,
he who hath begunne the worke in vs will also perfect
it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mal. 3. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Because I am not changed</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>therefore is it
that yee O sonnes of Iacob are not consumed.</HI></P>
<P>This purpose of God is called otherwise the will of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our calling &amp; conuersion flowes from Gods purpose &amp; therefore all the praise of it belongs to the Lord.</NOTE>
and the good pleasure of his Will. In that the Apostle
saith our calling is according to his purpose, it teacheth vs
to ascribe the whole praise of our saluation to the good plea|sure
of his will, and not to our owne foreseene merits. That
poyson of pride which Sathan poured into our first pa|rents,
and by which they aspyred to be equall with God,
doth yet breake forth in their posteritie, the corrupt heart of
man euer ayming at this, to seeke vnto himselfe either in
part or in whole, the power and praise of his own saluation.
This is to start vp into the roome of God, and to vsurpe
that glory which belongs to the Lord, and he will not giue
to any other: than the which no greater sacriledge can be
committed against the Lord. O man content thee with that
which the Lord offers thee, and let that alone which hee
reserues vnto himselfe: <HI>My peace</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>I giue
to you, my glory I will not giue to any other.</HI> The first Prea|chers
of the Gospell were Angels, they proclaymed glory
and peace, but glory they gaue to God which is on high,
and peace they cryed to the children of his good will which
are vpon earth. It is inough that peace and saluation is gi|uen
to be thine, but as for the glory of saluation let it remain
to the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="137">
Hee is for this called the father of mercy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For this cause he is called the Father of Mer|cy and not of Iudgement.</NOTE> because mercy
bred in his owne bosome. Hee hath found many causes
without himselfe mouing him to execute iustice, but a cause
mouing him to shew mercie hee neuer found, but the good
pleasure of his will:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 1. 9.</NOTE> therefore the Apostle saith, <HI>the Lord

of the same lumpe of clay to make vs vessels of honour,
whereof hee made others vessels of dishonour. And who
is able sufficiently to ponder so great a benefit? and there|fore
howsoeuer the blinded Pharisee sacrifice to his owne
net, and make his mouth to kisse his hand, as if his own hand
had done it, yet let the redeemed of the Lord praise the Lord;
let them cry out with a louder voyce than <HI>Dauid</HI> did, <HI>O Lord
what are wee that thou art so mindefull of vs? Not vnto vs O

<P>Now as for the calling;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our calling is twofold, and the inward cal|ling is a decla|ration of our election.</NOTE> we are to know that the calling of

For the decree of our election is alwaies hid and secret vnto
vs, till the Lord by calling reueile it, and make it knowne
vnto vs that we are of the number of those whom he hath

the first circle into the second, but it is not sufficient to sal|uation,
yea, rather they who stand in the second circle, hea|ring
the voyce of God calling them to repentance, and yet
harden their hearts and will not follow him, may looke
for a more fearefull condemnation then they who are in the

knoweth his Maisters will, and doth it not. Sodome and

hee finde them. When the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> should haue gone
to Bythinia, the Lord commaunded him to goe to Mace|donia,
what the purpose of God was, the euent declared,
namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts. 16.</NOTE> that it was to conuert <HI>Lidia</HI> and the Iaylour. Who
may not see here Gods meruailous mercy towards his
owne, that for the conuersion of a few, will haue his Gos|pell
to be preached to a whole kingdome? which doth yet
more clearely appeare, in that when hee commaunded his
Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to tarry at Corinthus, hee gaue this reason,
<HI>because</HI> (saith hee) <HI>I haue much people here:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts. 18. 10.</NOTE> shewing vnto
vs, that the greater haruest hee hath, the longer doth hee
continue his Labourers among a people. This is the very
work of God which hee is working in the middest of you,
and for which hee continueth among you the preaching of
his glorious Gospell, it is because toward many of you, hee
hath a purpose of loue: some hath he called already, whom
hee will haue confirmed; others not yet inwardly called, hee
will conuert by the Gospell, before hee remoue it. Let euery
man looke to himselfe, whether hee haue part in that grace
which comes by the Gospell, or no; for woe will be to him
that shall be found in darknesse, after that the light hath shi|ned
vnto him.</P>
<P>Good were it yet for vs all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If this were co~|sidered, it wold work a greater reuerence of the Gospell.</NOTE> if wee could more deepely
consider this, that the Gospell of the Lord Iesus is come
among vs, not by accident, nor by the meanes of men, but
by the purpose of God: that in these dayes wee heare that
voyce, which many of our Fathers heard not, that in some
places of the world this Gospell is preached, and not in
others, that it is continued with vs, notwithstanding of the
manifold machinations of the Children of darknesse to
<PB N="360" REF="139">
subuert it, yea, that by such and such persons the Gospell
hath beene preached vnto vs, if vvee did consider that all
these fall out according to Gods determinate purpose, it
would waken in vs a more reuerent hearing of the word of
Grace, and a greater care to take heede to the smallest oc|casion
of grace, when it is offered: but all the contempt
thereof which now is among men floweth from this, that
they doe not looke vnto the hand of God sending out such
a message to them, by such persons, at such a time, in such
a place, as hee in his eternall purpose hath concluded with
himselfe. But as <HI>Samuell</HI> before hee knew the Lord, thought
the voyce of God to be but the voyce of <HI>Eli,</HI> and therefore
went againe to his rest: so the great multitude of them who
heare it, not as the word of God, but as the word of men,
esteeming that it commeth by the meanes of men, and not
according to the determinate purpose of God, it is no mer|uaile
if still they returne to their old sinnes, and remaine dis|obedient
to the heauenly vocation.</P>
<P>And further out of the ground laid already,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fearefull to|ken of Gods departure, whe~ he ceaseth to call a people any more.</NOTE> that the cal|ling
of God is according to his purpose, we are taught, that
the least intermission of Gods calling should be vnto vs a
great matter of our humiliation; seeing the Lord calleth
men to be Preachers, and hath them in his hand as starres,
holding them out sometime to one part of the world, and
sometime to another, that hee may communicate light to
them who are sitting in darknesse; the remouing of them
from a people is a fearefull token of the Lords departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For no hus|bandman will want labourers in his field, as long as the har|uest is not ended.</NOTE>
and translating of his kingdome. The Husbandman calles
not his Labourers out of the field in the middest of the
day, vnlesse the haruest be done: and if the Lord remoue
his Seruants from a people, it is because his purpose is fini|shed;
for the ground is sure, that his calling is according to
his purpose: but the Lord forbid that the tearme of the end|ing
of this calling should euer come in our dayes.</P>
<P>And to the ende that wee haste it not vpon our selues,
wee are to know that as the Gospell comes not to a Land
<PB N="361" REF="139" MS="y">
by mans procurement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As the Gospell comes not by mans procure|ment, so no power of man can remoue it.</NOTE> so no power of man is able to re|moue
it. The Lord who set the Sunne in the Firmament,
and gouernes it in such sort, that it giues light to one part
of the world when another is in darknesse, and no malice of
the euill doer is able to obscure it, howeuer hee hates it,
hath also set his Gospell in the firmament of his Church,
to giue light to Goshen, while as Egypt is in darknesse;
and all the courses of politikes, though they were filled
vvith <HI>Achitophels</HI> wisedome, are not able to stay it: one|ly
our owne vnthankfulnesse, and abuse of the time of
Grace is to be feared; if therefore wee loue the light let vs
cast away the vvorkes of darkenesse, and walke in the light
while as yet wee haue it: let vs welcome those messengers
of peace, that come to vs in the name of the Lord, endeuou|ring
by all holy meanes to transferre this Kingdome of
God to our Children after vs, that they also may see the
beautie of the Lord, (which vvee haue seene) to their euer|lasting

<P>_THe whole Booke of God is full of heauenly
consolation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a treasure of comfort is to be digged out of this Verse.</NOTE> euery parcell thereof hath in it the
words of eternall life; but this place of Scrip|ture
wherein now wee are trauailing, may be
called aboue the rest a treasure of comfort, for
here the Apostle leadeth vp the Christian to the register of
God, and lets him see his owne name written in the booke
of life, his saluation established in Gods immutable decree,
exhibited now by Gods effectuall calling, to be performed
and perfected to him by his endlesse glorification. So that
in all the booke of God, there is not so cleare and certaine a
<PB N="362" REF="140">
sight of saluation giuen to the Christian as in this place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not so cleare a sight of saluati|on in all the booke of God.</NOTE> It
comforted <HI>Stephen</HI> when he was in the vally of death, that he
saw the heauens opened, and the Lord Iesus standing at the
right hand of his Father: and it should no lesse comfort vs
in all our tribulations that the Apostle here lets vs see the
third heauens opened vnto vs, to make knowne vnto vs the
will of God concerning our saluation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The linckes of the Chaine of saluation: Election: Cal|ling: Iustifica|tion: Glorifi|cation, are knit inseperably.</NOTE></P>
<P>This comfort the Apostle brake vp shortly as we heard
in the end of the last verse, and now more largely explanes
it in these two verses: in the which hee sets downe in order
the causes of our saluation, and lets vs see how our present
effectuall calling is so inseperably knit with our election &amp;
glorification by the hand of God, that no power in earth
nor in hell is able to sunder them: whereof the certaintie of
his former comfort appeares cleerely, that of necessitie all
things must worke together for the best vnto them that
loue God, euen to them that are called according to his
purpose. Which shall yet be more manifested if wee consi|der
how that this golden Chaine of our saluation reaches
(so to speake it) from eternitie to eternitie; the beginning
of it, albeit without beginning, is our Election; the end of
it, albeit without end, is our Glorification. And these two
ends of the chaine the Lord keepes them sure and secret in
his owne hand, but the two middle linckes thereof, to wit,
our Calling and Iustification, the Lord lets them downe
from heauen to the earth, that wee for our comfort might
gripe and apprehend them, and being sure of the two mid|dle
linekes, we might also be sure of the two ends, because
the Lord hath knit them inseperably together.</P>
<P>Thou then who wouldst be comforted with the assu|rance
of thy saluation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He that hath a sure hold of the middle linckes, Calling and Iustification, is sure of the o|ther two, Ele+ction and Glo|rification.</NOTE> make it first knowne to thy owne
conscience, by breaking off the former course of thy sinnes,
and by well doing for the time to come, that God hath cal|led
thee and iustified thee. Gripe sure as it were with the
one hand the lincke of Calling, and with the other the
linck of Iustification: fasten both thy hands vpon the middle
<PB N="363" REF="140">
linckes of this Chaine, that by them thou mayst be pulled
out of this dungeon and raised vp to heauen to see that
thou art one of them who was elected before time, &amp; after
time shall be glorified. To make this yet more plaine we are
to know that this mortall life of ours is a short interiected
point of time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our present life is a point of time betweene two eternities.</NOTE> betweene two eternities (so to call it,) in the
which some in feare and trembling working out their salua|tion
passes from Gods eternall election to endlesse glori|fication:
others againe in wantonnes and carelesse securitie,
drincke in iniquitie with greedinesse, and so steps from the
decree of reprobation, that most iustly they procure their
owne condemnation: So that euery man hath to consider
of his euerlasting weale or woe by his present disposition
in this life.</P>
<P>Oh that we had sanctified memories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If in this life we fall we may rise againe, but if in death we step downe|ward we shall neuer mend it.</NOTE> alwayes to remem|ber
this: so long as we are here, if of weakenesse wee fall wee
may rise againe, and if in one day we haue not learned well
to repent, we haue leaue of the Lords patience, to learne it
better another day: but he who in the day of his transmigra|tion
steps the wrong step, will neuer get leaue to amend it:
<HI>where the tree fals it shall lye there:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 11. 3.</NOTE> the wicked who die in their
sinnes, step downeward to the deepe pit and gulfe, out of
the which there is no redemption. Let vs therefore be well
aduised before we leape; let vs fasten the one foote vpon the
border of that Canaan, before we go out of the body; let vs
make sure that wee shall be receiued into those euerlasting
habitations. This shall be done if we make our whole life a
proceeding from election to glorification, and that through
calling and iustification, which two haue inseperably fol|lowing
them the sanctification and renouation of the whole
man. The Lord make vs wise in time that we may consider
the course of our life, and thinke of the end whereunto it
leads vs: for as <HI>Moses</HI> protested to Israell, so doe I vnto
you, <HI>I haue laid this day life and death before you:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deu. 30. 15.</NOTE> the Lord
giue you grace to make choise of the best.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="141">
In these causes of our saluation linked together in this
Chaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prescience and Predestination how they are here distingui|shed.</NOTE> we haue first to looke vnto Gods decree, consisting
in his foreknowledge and predestination: secondly, to the
execution thereof, which is made by his Calling, Iustifica|tion,
and Glorification. The decree hath in it these two acts
or preordinances (so to call them) Prescience and Predestina|tion,
which this manner of way are to be distinguished: by
foreknowledge the Lord sets before him the whole number
of mankinde, whom of the good pleasure of his owne will
he purposed to saue: so that the first preordinance is this,
these are they whom I will saue: by predestination againe
he concluded to saue them by such and such meanes; so that
the second preordinance of the decree is this; those whom
I haue decreed to saue I will saue this manner of way; so that
prescience lookes to the person to be saued, predestination
to the meanes whereby they are to be saued. Where wee
must consider that this decree of God is thus distinguished
by the Apostle in these two words for our capacitie, who
being but mortall creatures endued with reason, conceiues,
vnderstands, and discernes one thing after another, and can|not
doe otherwise: but it is not so with the Lord our God,
who being himselfe a most perfect vnderstanding, by one act
without prioritie or posterioritie, knowes, conceiues, and
discernes all things.</P>
<P>We come first now to speake of Gods foreknowledge:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prescience im|properly ascri|bed vnto God.</NOTE>
the properties of God are either absolute, as namely, that
he is a Spirit, simple, and infinite, or else such as haue a re|lation
to the creature. And of this sort is foreknowledge,
which improperly is ascribed vnto God: for properly there
is no fore not after in God, nothing past, nothing to come:
but foreknowledge is ascribed to God in respect of the crea|ture,
because he knew vs before that wee were. This fore|knowledge
is two wayes considered:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prescience two manner of wayes conside|red, generally, and specially.</NOTE> first, generally, as it is
extended to all his creatures, and so it is compared to a com|mon
booke of register, wherein the Lord hath written all
things which were afterward to be: and of this speakes the
<PB N="365" REF="141">
Psalmist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 139. 15</NOTE> <HI>My bones</HI> (sayth he) <HI>are not hid from thee, though
I was made in a secret place and fashioned beneath in the earth,
thine eyes did see mee, when I was without forme: for in thy
booke were all things written, which in continuance of time were
fashioned, though they were not before.</HI> Of it also speakes the
Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 13.</NOTE> <HI>All things are manifest in his sight with whom wee
haue to doe.</HI> This manner of way foreknowledge is Gods
vniuersall eye, by which vvith one looke hee knoweth all
his creatures vvithin and vvithout, their nature, their shape,
their actions, their beginnings, their ends, but foreknow|ledge
this manner of vvay considered, is not a lincke of this
Chaine, it being certaine that there is not one of these lincks
more patent, not largely extended than another, as yee shall
afterward heare.</P>
<P>Foreknowledge then in this Chaine of Saluation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In this Chaine it is specially considered as it lookes to the Elect onely.</NOTE> is spe|cially
considered, as it is conioyned <HI>cum</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, with the
loue and liking of God, as it is all one with Election, exten|ded
to none but vnto the children of his good will: this way
it is affirmed of the Godly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 13. 18.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord knoweth who are his,</HI>
but denyed of the wicked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 7. 23.</NOTE> <HI>depart from me yee workers of ini|quitie,
I know you not,</HI> that is, albeit I know your persons,
yea, your most secret actions, yet your selues I know not,
so that I loue you: and this way foreknowledge specially
considered, is called the booke of life, vvherein the Lord
hath written the names of those vvhom hee hath ordayned
to life.</P>
<P>Predestination is also two manner of wayes considered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Predestination is also two wayes conside|red.</NOTE>
first, as it is generally extended to all his creatures, for as he
knew them all before they were, so he appointed them by
middes vnto their owne end; other artificers when they haue
made a worke, know not what will be the end of it; hee that
buildeth an house, knowes not how long it vvill stand, whe|ther
fire shall consume it, or the winde ouer-turne it, or the
earth-quake vndermine it; but the Lord as hee hath made
his creatures, so hath he appoynted them to an end, which
hee knoweth himselfe: but here Predestination is specially
<PB N="366" REF="142">
considered, and is no larger than Election, respecting the
Elect onely, whom he hath ordayned vnto life by his owne
middes: for the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, here not onely signifieth
to ordayne to an end, but also to appoynt all the limits, bor|ders,
and middes, within and by which thou art to come to
that end.</P>
<P>Where,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreseene me|rits falsely col|lected out of this place.</NOTE> before wee come to the doctrine of instruction,
wee vvill shortly encounter vvith our aduersaries, who read
these words in this manner; that the Lord predestinated
those whom hee fore-knew to be conformed to the image
of his Sonne, that so they may establish here out, their er|rour
of fore-seene merits. It were sufficient to bring against
them the best learned of their owne side, some wherofread
these words no otherwise then wee doe; as the Iesui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s of
Rhemes: others plainely impugne that reading, and the er|rour
of foreseene merits founded vpon it, for so <HI>Caietane</HI>
writeth vpon this place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This errour is improued by their own men as Caietane.</NOTE> <HI>Ad confutandum dogma illorum,

diuinae ad confutandum inquit haec, primum nostrae salu|tis
locum tribuit diuino proposito, dicendo ijs qui secundum pro|positum
vocati sunt.</HI> To confute (saith hee) the doctrine of
those, who giue the first place of saluation to Gods fore|knowledge
of mans merits, which hee was to doe, and so
puts his prescience as a reason and cause of his predestina|tion;
to confute these I say, hee giues the first place of salua|tion
to the purpose of God, while hee saith, to them that
are called according to his purpose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Aquinas.</NOTE> <HI>Aquinas</HI> in like man|ner
writing vpon this same place, sayth: <HI>Ponere quod aliquod
meritum ex parte nostra praesupponatur, cuius praescientia, sit
ratio praedestinationis, nihil est aliud quam ponere gratiam dari
ex meritis nostris, &amp; quod principium bonorum operum est ex
nobis, &amp; consummatio ex Deo.</HI> To affirme that any merit vp|on
our part must be presupposed, the prescience whereof
was the cause of predestination, is no other thing but to af|firme
that grace were giuen of our merits, and that the
<PB N="367" REF="142">
beginning of good workes were of our selues, and the con|summation
thereof were of God: therefore (saith hee) the
words are to be read this way more coueniently, whom he
fore-knew them hee also predestinated to be made like vn|to
the image of his Sonne, <HI>vt ista conformitas non sit ratio prae|destinationis
sed effectus,</HI> that so this conformitie be not a
cause of predestination but an effect.</P>
<P>But beside these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sanctification is an effect of predestination and therefore not a cause of it.</NOTE> this errour is conuinced by manifold
proofes of holy Scripture: the Apostle saith, <HI>hee hath chosen
vs in Christ,</HI> therefore not in our selues: he saith againe, <HI>that
wee should be holy and without blame,</HI> hee saith not, hee chose
vs because hee foresaw that wee would be holy; so hee sets
downe sanctification as an effect of Predestination.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 1. 4.</NOTE> Now it
is certaine that one effect of Predestination may well be the
cause of an other posterior effect, as the preaching of the
word is a cause of faith, and faith is a certaine cause of insti|fication,
but no effect of Predestination can be cause of it.
Againe he saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. 1. 9.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord hath saued vs, and called vs with
an holy calling, not according to our workes,</HI> here yee see, that
in our calling our workes and Gods purpose are manifestly
opponed, so that the putting of the one is the remouing of
the other: thus neyther in our Election before time, not
in our calling in time, hath the Lord regarded our works,
or foreseene rectitude of our will, but the good pleasure of
his owne will.</P>
<P>And I pray you what other thing could the Lord fore|see
in vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The calling of God sinds eue|ry man in an euill estate.</NOTE> than that which hee foresaw in the Israelites? <HI>I
knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck an iron sinew, and
thy browe brasse:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 48. 8.</NOTE> <HI>I knew that thou wouldest grieuously trans|gresse,
therefore I called thee a transgressor from the wombe,
yet for my Names sake will I deferre my wrath, and for my
praise will I refraine it from thee, that I cut thee not off:</HI> yea, in
so many places of holy Scripture doth the Lord plead the
cause of his owne glory, that it cannot be but a most feare|full
sacriledge against so cleare a light for a man eyther in
part or in whole, to make his own merits a cause of saluation.

But now to returne to the doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Predestination takes not away the second cau|ses and meanes of saluation.</NOTE> we haue first to ob|serue
out of the signification of the word which I marked
before, that the Lords determinate counsell and predestina|tion
takes not away the nature, properties, nor necessities
of secondarie causes and meanes of saluation, but rather esta|blishes
them: for those whom God hath appointed to sal|uation,
hee hath also appointed to those meanes which may
bring them vnto it. It is therefore a blasphemie which is fre|quent
in the mouthes of carnall professers, if I be elected
howsoeuer I liue I shall be saued, and if otherwise I be a re|probate,
liue as I will I cannot mend it: this is no other

nature of fire to be cold, so is it impossible that the elect
man effectually called can reason after this manner, yea the
more hee heares of election, the more hee endeauours to
make it sure by well doing, knowing that no man can at|taine
to the end of our Faith, which is the saluation of our

that which God hath willed, before that euer a creature
was? onely let vs labour that as our election is sure in it
selfe, so we may make it sure vnto vs, by walking in a good
conscience before the Lord, and then we shall not care what
man or Angell say to the contrary against it; they are but
posterior creatures, and what intrest can they haue to gaine

knowne to vs, but knowne to the Lord; not one more nor
one lesse shall be pertakers of saluation. <HI>Many</HI> (saith out

shall sit with Abraham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat, 8. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Isaac, and Iacob, in the kingdome of

but many shall come. This should waken in vs a holy care
so long as the calling of God continues among vs, to take
heed to our selues, striuing to thrust in at the doore of the
kingdome of heauen: for it suffers violence, and the violent
<PB N="371" REF="144">
take it; the fewer there be to be receiued into that kingdome,
the more we should about to be of that number.<NOTE PLACE="marg">So is it in na|ture that rarest things are most regarded.</NOTE> We see that

creature; but parcels of the earth possessed by men
in propertie, are much more remembred and regarded by
those to whom they belong; riches and honour are in greater
account among men because few attaine vnto them: and if
we were as wise in spirituall things, that grace of Christ
which brings saluation would be more pretious and deere
vnto vs, because it is communicated to few. The Lord giue

<P><HI>To be made like to the image of his Sonne.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Predestination is vnto glory by a conformi|tie with Christ in our present life.</NOTE> The Apostle
insists not in the rest of the linckes of the Chaine; hauing
touched them he leaues them, onely he insists in this lincke
of Predestination: teaching vs that he vseth not here the
word of Predestination generally, but restraines it to Pre|destination
vnto life; as also that we cannot step from electi|on
to glory but by a conformitie with Christ, which is most
necessary for vs to marke: for albeit there be great comfort
in the consideration of Gods immutable purpose ordayning
man to life, as also in the consideration of that glory where|unto
we are ordayned, yet neither of them can comfort vs
vnlesse we be sure that our life is a proceeding from electi|on
to glorification by the right meanes.</P>
<P>The first and neerest end of election in regard of man,
is his sanctification:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 1. 4.</NOTE> for the Lord hath chosen vs that wee
should be holy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">As Christ is the life, so is he the way, nei|ther can wee come to life but by the way</NOTE> the second and furthest end is mans glori|fication.
The same Lord Iesus who said <HI>I am the life,</HI> said in
like manner <HI>I am the way and the veritie:</HI> if thou wouldst be
at life, lye not still in thy sinnes, but rise and walke in the way,
and if thou knowest not the way, learne it from him who is
veritie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 14. 6.</NOTE> Let not presumption which slayes the wicked ouer|take
thee; they passe ouer the matter of their saluation with
a wanton word; their hearts are prophane, yet they boast
<PB N="372" REF="145">
with their tongues that they are sure to be saued; but this
is a vaine reioycing: for he that walkes not in the way, how
is it possible that he can come to the end? assuredly he shall
neuer come where Christ is to liue with him, that walkes
not after Christ in newnesse of life.</P>
<P>This conformitie with the Lord Iesus whereunto wee
are predestinated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conformitie with Christ wherein it stands.</NOTE> is partly in this life, partly in the life to
come. Our conformitie in the life to come shall stand in li|uing
and raigning with Christ, which is our glorification,
whereof he speakes hereafter. Our conformitie in this life
stands in liuing and suffering with Christ, and of this hee
speakes here; to liue godly after the rule of Christ, to suffer
patiently after the similitude of Christ, are the two parts of
our present conformitie with him. The Lord Iesus is giuen
vs of the Father both to be a Sauiour, and an example, vn|lesse
we make him an example to follow him in our doing
and suffering, he shall not be vnto vs a Sauiour.</P>
<P>Here we are to marke that the workes done by Christ in
our nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Workes done by Christ are threefold: 1. personall workes of Re|demption: 2. Miracles: 3. workes of a godly life.</NOTE> are threefold: first, his personall workes of Re|demption;
as that he was borne of the Virgin; that he suf|fered
the cursed death of the Crosse, for the expiation of
our sinnes; that hee rose the third day for our iustification;
that hee ascended triumphantly into Heauen, leading capti|uitie
captiue. Secondly, his workes of miracles; as that hee
fasted forty dayes; gaue sight to the blinde; life to the dead,
and such like. Thirdly, his workes of godlinesse and san|ctification;
as that he was subiect to his parents; louing to
his brethren; painefull in his calling; perseuering in prayer.
To practise to follow him in his personall workes of Re|demption
is blasphemie, or in his workes of Miracles is im|possibilitie,
but to follow him in the workes of a godly life,
is true pietie. In the first Papists are blasphemous, that on
good Fryday makes a play to the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the first and second Papists are apish imi|tators.</NOTE> by counterfaiting
the sufferings of Christ. In the second Papists are ridicu|lous,
that practise to counterfaite him in his fortie dayes
fasting, as if that might ordinarily be done of men, which
<PB N="373" REF="145">
once Iesus did for a Miracle. In the third let all those who
are truely religious striue to follow him: as Children loo|king
to their coppy learne to mend their letters; so let vs
by looking daily to our example, learne to amend our
liues.</P>
<P>Imitation in the first two Iesus did neuer require,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the third onely should we follow the Lord Iesus.</NOTE> onely
hee craues that wee should follow him in the third: there
is his voyce, <HI>Learne of me that I am lowly and meeke,</HI> he did
not bid thee (saith <HI>Augustine</HI>) learne at him how to make
the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn, 13. 15.</NOTE> or how to raise the dead, but how to be lowly
and meeke, for this cause did our blessed Sauiour wash his
Disciples feete, that hee might giue vs an example, how
one of vs should serue another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn, 15. 12.</NOTE> <HI>as I haue loued you</HI> (saide
Iesus) <HI>so loue yee one another:</HI> yea, in that vpon the Crosse
hee prayed for his enimies, hee hath also taught vs how to
practise that precept,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5. 44.</NOTE> <HI>Pray for them who persecute you.</HI> In pa|tience
likewise hee is proposed vnto vs for an example,
for so are wee exhorted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb, 12. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Let vs runne with patience the race
that is set before vs, looking vnto Iesus the author and fini|sher
of our Faith:</HI> these and such like are the workes where|in
vve are commaunded to conforme our selues vnto him.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">We must also follow the Lord Iesus in suffering.</NOTE>
<P>The other poynt wherein stands our conformitie with
him, is in patient suffering with him for righteousnes, which
wee shall not be able to doe, except wee liue first after the
similitude of his life: what liker suffering to the suffering of
Christ, than the suffering of that reprobate theefe, who
dyed with Iesus at the same time, the same kinde of death?
yet because his life was neuer like the life of Christ, his suf|ferings
shall neuer be accounted the sufferings of Christ.
<HI>Similis in poena,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Augustine.</NOTE> <HI>dissimilis in causa.</HI> But as for the other whom
the Lord Iesus conuerted vpon the Crosse, to declare to all
the world that euen in death, hee retayned the power of a
Sauiour, able to giue life to them who are dead, hee brought
out in the last houre of his life, the first fruites of amende|ment
of life; hee liued long a wicked malefactor, but short
while a conuerted Christian; yet in that same space hee
<PB N="374" REF="146">
abounded in the fruits of Godlinesse, confessing his sinnes,
giuing glory to the iustice of God, rebuking the blasphe|mies
of the other, and pleading the cause of his innocent
Sauiour; thus being turned from his sinne, hee began, euen
on the Crosse to liue with Iesus, and therefore heard that
ioyfull sentence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 23. 43.</NOTE> <HI>This night thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>Now that wee may be moued to embrace this conformi|tie
with Iesus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons mo|uing vs to a co~|formitie with Christ.</NOTE> let vs remember that the image of God, by
which wee were created conforme vnto him, is the most
<MILESTONE N="1"> auncient glory to which we can make claime:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Image of God is our most auncient glory, stollen from vs by Sa|than and which we should seek to recouer.</NOTE> and therefore
if there be in vs any peece of manhood and spirituall wise|dome,
wee ought to endeauour to recouer it, which our
enimie craftily and maliciously hath stollen from vs. O what
a pittie is it to see that man cannot doe that in the matter of
saluation, which he can do in the smallest things pertaining
to this life? There is no man among vs vvho knoweth that
any tenement of land, or portion of earth possessed now vn|iustly
of another, did of old pertaine to his Fathers, but if
hee can, hee vvill seeke to recouer it; seeking by iustice to
bring that home to himselfe, which oppressors vniustly had
taken from him. Is it not then most lamentable, that where
the Lord Iesus the King of righteousnesse, and Prince of
peace, offers to restore vs to our most auncient glory, which
is his owne image, that vvee vvill not call the oppressours
of our soule before him, nor seeke to be restored to that
glory, which most deceitfully our aduers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ry hath stollen
from vs? but this commeth also vpon man by the subtiltie
of Sathan, that hauing once spoyled vs of the image of God,
hee doth what he can so to blinde vs, that vve should neuer
seeke it againe, nor doe so much as receiue it when it is of|fered
vnto vs.</P>
<P><HI>Iacob</HI> complained of <HI>Laban</HI> that hee had deceiued him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathan a dou|ble deceiuer.</NOTE>
and changed his wages ten times; and <HI>Esau</HI> complained of
<HI>Iacob,</HI> as of a supplanter, who first had stollen from him
his birth-right, and then the blessing also: but more cause
haue vvee to turne these complaints vpon Sathan, who hath
<PB N="375" REF="146">
not onely stollen from vs the Image of God, but daily stea|leth
away the blessing, vvhereby it is restored vnto vs. Oh
that vve had vvise and vnderstanding hearts, that we might
be stirred vp to an holy anger against the enimie of our sal|uation,
seeking in despite of him to be restored to that right,
vvhich by creation belonged to our fore father. But alas,
what a beastly stupiditie is this, that man will not doe so
much for recouerie and maintenance of the image of God,
as hee will doe for preseruation of his owne portraiture
drawne on a peece of timber? if any man pollute it, incon|tinent
hee is offended, and stomacks it, as an iniu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ie done
to himselfe, but as for man who is the image of God: he lyes
downe like a beast, content that Sathan should tread vpon
him, pollute, &amp; defile him with all kind of abhomination, all
which proceeds from a pittifull ignorance of his own glory.</P>
<P>The second reason vvhich should moue vs to conforme <MILESTONE N="2">
our selues to Iesus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iesus Christ hath first con|formed him|selfe vnto vs.</NOTE> is that hee hath first of all conformed
himselfe vnto vs, hee vvas not ashamed to take vpon him
the shape of a seruant, and to become man like vnto vs in
all things, sinne excepted; and shall wee refuse to conforme
our selues vnto him? let it be farre from vs, but rather put|ting
from vs that foolish emulation, by vvhich vvee striue
to conforme our selues vnto this world, let vs consider
vvhereunto vvee are called, euen to be pertakers of the di|uine
nature, and may thinke it our greatest glory to be like
vnto our head and husband the Lord Iesus.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We cannot be saued except we be comfor|med to him.</NOTE> necessitie so craueth, seeing vvee cannot be sa|ued <MILESTONE N="3">
vvithout conformitie vvith him. It is not <HI>Caesars</HI> money
which hath not vpon it <HI>Caesars</HI> image and superscription; he
is not the Sonne of God vvho carryeth not the image of his
Father: for vvhom the Lord begets in the regeneration, he
communicateth to them his owne spirit, which transformes
them into the similitude of his owne Image. No vncleane
thing shall enter into heauenly Ierusalem, neither shall any
man see him in his glory, who by grace is not made like vnto
him.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="147">
<HI>That hee may be the first borne among many brethren.</HI> The
Apostle insists here in the explication of his former pur|pose,
adding that it is necessary wee should conforme our
selues vnto him, for ratifying that superioritie and priui|ledge
of the first borne, vvhich God the Father hath esta|bished
vnto his Sonne the Lord Iesus Christ; and he ma|keth
it very properly to serue his purpose: for seeing it is
so that Iesus our elder brother, and Prince of our saluation,
hath beene consecrated by affliction, and by suffering hath
entred into his kingdome, shall wee refuse to follow him
in his tentations, if so be vvee desire to sit vvith him in his
glory?</P>
<P>The name of the first borne is ascribed vnto Iesus Christ
three manner of wayes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The name of the first borne three wayes as|cribed to Christ: 1. as God: 2. as man: 3. as a mediator</NOTE> first, as hee is God: secondly, as he
is man: thirdly, as hee is both God and man, our mediator,
and the head of his misticall body, vvhich is his Church. As
hee is God, hee is called by the Apostle, <HI>Primogenitus om|nis
creaturae,</HI> the first begotten of euery creature; and that
by such a generation as none (saith <HI>Esay</HI>) are able to ex|presse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 1. 15.</NOTE>
Now before the creature was, what could there be?
surely nothing but the Creator. Secondly, as hee is man S.
<HI>Luke</HI> calleth him the first borne that opened the wombe
of the Virgin.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 2. 7.</NOTE> Thirdly, as Mediator and head of his my|sticall
body, as Prince of that kingdome vvhich is the com|munion
of Saints: hee is here called <HI>the first borne among ma|ny
brethren,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 20</NOTE> and in an other place <HI>the first fruites of them who
rise from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>The priuiledges of the first borne were two:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priuiledges of the first borne are two: 1. ex|cellencie of strength: 2. ex|cellencie of dignitie.</NOTE> first, ex|cellencie
of strength, for hee had a double portion: second|ly,
excellency of dignitie, for he vvas the Prince and priest
of the rest of his brethren: now both these most properly
appertaines to our eldest brother Christ Iesus. Excellencie
of strength is his, hee hath receiued the double portion: for
hee receiued not the Spirit in measure as wee doe, but the
plentitude and fulnesse thereof was communicated vnto him,
and the comfort thereof redounds vnto vs: for he receiued
<PB N="377" REF="147">
it not for himselfe but for vs, that of his fulnesse we might
all receiue grace for grace. Excellencie also of dignitie is his;
for beside that glory which hee had with his Father from
the beginning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 28. 18.</NOTE> hee is also as our head crowned with glory
and dignitie; all power in heauen and earth is giuen him,
and he is set ouer his brethren, as the onely high Priest of
the liuing God, who makes attonement for the sinnes of
his brethren; as the onely Prophet and teacher of the whole
familie of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3. 17.</NOTE> for so hath the Father authorized him: <HI>This
is my beloued sonne, in whom I am well pleased, heare him.</HI></P>
<P>Let vs therefore submit our selues vnto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miserable are they in this age who doe not acknowledge Christs prero|gatiue.</NOTE> seeing God
the Father hath set him ouer vs, let vs not be disobedient to
that heauenly proclamation (<HI>heare him.</HI>) Woe be to them
that subscribes not vnto the excellencie of his dignitie. But
alas, if the world proclaime such pleasures as shee hath to
giue by any sport or play, or such profits as she can yeeld
at her fairest fayres and markets, O what a frequent con|course
of people is made vnto her? but if the Priests of the
Lord stand as they did of old in the west part of Ierusalems
temple, on their seuerall turrets, to blow their two siluer
Trumpets, and warne the people to resort vnto the house of
the Lord, or if now any other manner of way signification
be made vnto them to enter into the courts of the Lord with
praise, how few shall hee finde flocking vnto the house of
God in respect of them who abides without, and followes
the world; and which is yet more to be lamented, there are
many of those who heare the word of Christ, and yet doth
not change the manner of their conuersation for any com|maundement
he can giue them; speake what he will, they
doe what they like: they come to the holy assemblies of his
Saints, but are like those vncleane beasts which entred into
the Arke of <HI>Noah,</HI> they came in vncleane, and went out vn|cleane.
Neither of these vnlesse they amend, shall be perta|kers
of that saluation which Iesus the first borne hath pur|chased
to the rest of his brethern.</P>
<P>But to let them alone, and to returne to the instruction

of Gods children;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whatsoeuer excellencie our elder brother hath it is for our benefit.</NOTE> though aposta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e Israell fall from him as a

for our first borne &amp; elder brother. Among other brethren
the more the elder hath, the lesse remaines to the younger;
whereof it falles out that many a time there is strife among
them for diuision of the inheritance: but here the more our
elder brother hath, the greater is our good, seeing whatso|euer
he hath receiued as mediator, he hath receiued it to be
communicated vnto vs: hee hath receiued strength not to
subdue vs, or ouergoe vs, but to protect vs from our eni|mies,
which he hath also done; for he hath broken the gates
of hell, and carryed them away more triumphantly vpon
his shoulders than <HI>Sampson</HI> did the gates of Azzah. Wee
who are poore in our selues are made rich in him: we who
are weake are in him more than conquerours, and therefore
let vs resolue for euer to abide in him.</P>
<P><HI>Among many brethren.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brethren in Christ are ma|ny wayes knit together.</NOTE> This brotherhood of our with

are begotten is one, &amp; the spirit which quickneth them all is
one. It is not then Baptisme nor externall profession which
proueth a man to be the kinseman and brother of Christ;
it is the spirit of Iesus, which whosoeuer hath not, the same
is not his, and whosoeuer hath him, it is certaine they be|come
new creatures.</P>

that had hee beene worthie to be loued for euer: but be|hold
what a greater loue our Lord hath shewed vnto vs,

yet did hee still retaine his kindly affection toward vs,
when we were carried away captiue by spirituall <HI>Chedarlao|mer,</HI>
he did not onely hazard, but laid downe his life of our

was honourable in Aegipt, hee left the court of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> to
visit his brethren, esteeming the rebuke of Christ in his

<HI>Ioseph</HI> is also commended, that being second person vnder
<HI>Pharaoh</HI> in the kingdome of Aegipt, yet he was not asha|med
of his Father and brethren, albeit they for their trade
being sheepekeepers, were abhomination to the Aegiptians.
But all these are not comparable to that loue which the
Lord Iesus hath borne toward vs, in that notwithstanding
our base estate, hee hath not beene ashamed to call vs his
brethren. The Lord make vs thankfull, and shed abroad

<P>This inward Calling is the donation of Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the in|ward calling is.</NOTE> by the prea|ching
of the Gospell, or communication of the sauing grace
of Iesus, by which wee are moued to answere the Lord, and
follow the heauenly vocation: for as the Lord by the prea|ching
of the Gospell offers vnto all, that are in the Church
visible, righteousnesse and life by Christ, if they will repent
and beleeue: (wherein consists the outward Calling) so by
his holy Spirit, hee giueth to his Elect children iustifying
Faith, by which he openeth their hearts as he did the heart
of <HI>Lidia,</HI> to receiue the grace offered by the Gospell, and
herein consists the inward Calling.</P>
<P>The word <GAP DESC="foreign"> whereby the Apostle expresseth it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In this Calling there is a taking of some, &amp; lea|uing of others.</NOTE>
signifieth to euocate and chose out some from among o|thers:
this shall make the greatnesse of Gods mercy toward
vs appeare the more clearely, if wee doe consider that wee
and the reprobate were alike by nature, borne blinde rebels,
<PB N="383" REF="150">
and transgressors from the wombe, and did walke on with
them in the same course of disobedience, which leadeth to
damnation: but it pleased God to call vs out of their fellow|ship,
and enter vs in a better cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">se that wee might be saued.
A notable example where of wee haue in the calling of <HI>Lot</HI>
out of Sodome: the Lord hauing concluded to consume
Sodome with fire, for her abhominable fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hinesse, hee first
of all sent two Angels to call <HI>Lot</HI> out of it; but <HI>Lot</HI> not
knowing the danger, lingred and delayed to follow their
calling, till at the length they put hands vnto him and for|ced
him to goe out; but when hee was set vpon the moun|taine,
and knew the fearefull destruction of Sodome, then
no doubt hee acknowledged the wonderfull mercy which
God had shewed vpon him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">God hath ta|ken vs out from amo~g the chil|dren of wrath, as he took Lot out of Sodome</NOTE> it is euen so with vs, wee are
here soiourning in a Sodome which God will destroy, and
we haue our conuersation among those whose portion shall
be in the lake that burns with fire &amp; brimstone from which
the Lord being purposed to saue vs, hath sent his Angels to
vs, not two but many Ministers of the Gospell of Grace,
exhorting vs to flye from the wrath which is to come: but
alas, because wee know not the danger, we flye slowly, and
delay to follow the heauenly vocation, but in that day wher|in
wee shall be set vpon the mountaine of Gods saluation,
and shall stand at the right hand of Iesus, and heare that fear|full
condemnation of the wicked, <HI>Depart from mee, &amp;c.</HI>
when vvee shall see the earth open and swallow them, then
shall wee reioyce and prayse the mercy of our God: O hap|pie
time wherein the Lord sent his messengers among vs,
to call vs from the fellowship of the damned.</P>
<P>There is no difference by nature betweene the Elect and
reprobate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No difference by nature be|tweene elect men &amp; repro|bate, till our calling make it</NOTE> neyther in inward nor outward disposition till
God make it by grace. <HI>Paul</HI> as bloudy a persecuter as euer
was <HI>Domitian</HI> or <HI>Iulian. Zacheus</HI> as vnconscionable and co|uetous
a Worldling, as was that rich Glutton damned to
hell. The elect and reprobate men, before Grace make a
difference, are like two men walking in one iourney, with
<PB N="384" REF="151">
one minde and one heart, like <HI>Eliah</HI> and <HI>Elisha,</HI> walking
and talking together, when a chariot of fire did incontinent
seperate them, and <HI>Eliah</HI> is taken vp into heauen, <HI>Elisha</HI> left
vpon the earth: not vnlike is it when the vnlooked for cal|ling
of God commeth and seperateth those two who before
were walking together, yea, running in the same excesse of
ryot; the one changing the course of his life, returneth back
againe to the Lord, from whom hee had stollen: whereas
the other not touched with the same Calling, meruailes that
his former companion hath forsaken him, and walketh still
on stubbornely in the former course of his sinnes to his con|demnation.
Apply this vnto your selues and see whether
this effectuall Calling hath seperated you in your conuer|sation
from the wicked or not, an euident argument that ye
shall be seperated from them in their condemnation: <HI>Bles|sed
is hee, that walketh not in the counsell of the wicked, nor
stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornfull.</HI></P>
<P>And if wee finde after tryall that the Lord hath called
vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time of our calling is to vs as the de|liuerance from Egipt, or the yeere of Iubily to Israel.</NOTE> then should wee alway shew forth his prayses, who
hath translated vs from darknesse into his meruailous light.
The Lord shewed a great mercy to Israell when he deli|uered
them out of the house of bondage; he set the remem|brance
of that benefit in the forefront of his law, as a bond
euer oblieging them vnto thankfulnesse: but their bondage
was not so horrible as ours. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> oppressed their bodies
and compelled them to worke in bricke and clay, yet their
spirits were free to sigh and cry to God for the bondage:
but here so long as we were the slaues of Sathan, he com|pelled
vs to worke the abhominable workes of darknesse
and vncleannesse, and therewithall did so captiue our spirits
that we could not so much as cry and sigh vnto God for
the bondage, and therefore our deliuerance should neuer
goe out of our remembrance, and our hearts and mouthes
should euer be filled with the prayses of our redeemer, when
we think of this yeere of Iubilie, wherin he hath opened the
doore of the prison, and set vs at libertie as the freemen of
<PB N="385" REF="151">
God, who were the captiued and bond slaues of Sathan.</P>
<P>The author of this calling is the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calling being a new creation is onely wrought by God.</NOTE> euen hee who

commanded light to shine out of darkenes, is he who hath
giuen to our mindes the light of the knowledge of his glory
in the face of Iesus Christ. It is he who creates in vs a new
hart, and puts in our bowels a new spirit, that we may walk
in his statutes. As man when hee was not, could not helpe
to create himselfe; and <HI>Lazarus</HI> when he was dead helped
not to raise himselfe: so a stranger from Grace helpes not
to call himselfe to the fellowship of Grace: the Lord who
makes the barraine wombe a mother of many children,
makes also the barraine hart to be fruitfull. The praise of
our calling belongs to the Lord onely.<NOTE PLACE="marg">August. de verb. Apost.</NOTE> <HI>Nemo dicat id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o me

I worshipped him, for thou couldst not haue worshipped
him vnlesse he had called thee.</P>
<P>The calling of God findes euery man either vainely or
wickedly exercised.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Man hath not so much as minde of it when it comes to him.</NOTE> When God called <HI>Paul</HI> to be a Prea|cher,
he found him a persecuter: when he called <HI>Matthew</HI>
he found him sitting at the receipt of custome: when he cal|led
<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Andrew</HI> they were mending their nets, no
such minde had they as to be fishers of men. As <HI>Saul</HI> was
seeking his Fathers Asses, when <HI>Samuel</HI> came to call him
to the kingdome: and as <HI>Rebecca</HI> had no errand to the
well but to water her fathers goods, when <HI>Eliezer</HI> came
to seeke her in marriage vnto <HI>Isaac:</HI> so if wee doe en|quire
at our owne consciences how we were exercised when
God called vs, we shall finde our harts were set vpon the
trifling things of this world, and that we had no minde of his
kingdome: let the praise therefore of our calling ber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rued
to the Lord onely.</P>
<P>As this worke of calling is the Lords onely, so hee ex|tends
it to none but vnto those who are chosen: it makes a

perticular seperation of a few from the remanant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">None are cal|led by this cal|ling but they who are elect.</NOTE> and doth
so distinguish betweene man and man in all ranckes and

as <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Balaam,</HI> of two Kings as <HI>Dauid</HI> and
<HI>Saul,</HI> of two Apostles as <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iudas,</HI> of two theeues
the one is taken, the other is reiected. The first distinction
betweene man and man was in Gods eternall counsell, and
this is secret: the last distinction will be in that last day
wherein the one shall stand at the right hand of Iesus, the
other at the left, and that shall be manifest: the middle di|stinction
is presently made by this calling of God; his Gos|pell
is the arme of his Grace, being extended sometime to
one corner of the world, sometime to another, according to
his owne dispensation, to seuer out his owne from among
the remanent of the world.</P>
<P>Whereof it comes to passe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a wonder+full distinction this calling makes among men.</NOTE> that this sauing grace of the
Gospell enters into a land, but not into euery Cittie; it enters
into a Cittie, and not into euery familie; it enters into a fa|milie,
but comes not on euery person of the familie. Of
Husband and Wife, of Maisters and Seruants, of Parents
and Children, of Brethren and Sisters, the one is taken, the
other reiected. It came to Iericho and chose out <HI>Zacheus:</HI>
it came to Philippi and chose out <HI>Lydia</HI> and the Iaylour: it
entred at Rome into the Court of <HI>Nero,</HI> but lighted not
vpon <HI>Nero:</HI> it entred into the Familie of <HI>Narcissus,</HI> but not
into the heart of <HI>Narcissus.</HI> As the Lord so gouernes the
cloudes that he makes them raine vpon one Cittie and not
vpon another: so doth hee dispense the dew of his grace,
that he makes it drop vpon one hart, &amp; not vpon another.
The Gospell is preached to many, but the blessing that
comes by the Gospell abides onely vpon the children of
peace. Let euery one among you see to himselfe, this prea|ching
of the Gospell among you assures vs that the Lord
hath a haruest here, that is, a number that belongs to the
election of Grace: but who they are that are his the Lord
knoweth, but as for vs we may lament as <HI>Augustine</HI> did of
<PB N="387" REF="152">
the hearers of his time, <HI>In aperto est vnde doleam, &amp;c,</HI> the
matter of our griefe is manifest: for wee see many of you
who hitherto haue receiued the word of grace in vaine: but
the matter of our comfort is not so apparant; yet doe wee
not doubt but that among this chaffe the Lord hath some
good Wheat, whom he will perfect by our Ministrie, and
gather into his garner, to his glory and our comfort, when
wee shall see that fruit of our labour, which now we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> can|not
see.</P>
<P>Alwayes of this which we haue spoken we exhort you
who as yet stands strangers from grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miserable are they whom this calling hath not sepe|rated.</NOTE> to consider how mi|serable
your estate is. It should peirce thy very hart for griefe,
to consider that the grace of God hath conuerted so many
in the cittie, yea perhaps in the familie wherein thou dwel|lest,
and hath not lighted vpon thee, but left thee in thy
old sinnes. If the Lord should so doe to you as hee did to
Israell in the dayes of <HI>Achab,</HI> cause it to raine for three
yeeres and a halfe vpon all the land about you, and not vp|on
your land, would you not take it as a token of Gods
anger aganist you? O hipocrite that can discerne the face
of the skie, and can marke the tokens of his anger in the
creature, canst thou not discerne the state of thy own soule?
nor consider this sensible curse of God, that these thirty or
forty yeeres the showres of his sauing grace hath discended
vpon othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> round about thee, but neuer vpon thy selfe:
thou possessest still a hard, a barraine, and fruitlesse heart.
What shall I say vnto thee? to cut thee off from hope of
mercy, and to send thee to dispaire, I haue not that in com|mission,
there is euer some hope of a better as long as God
calles vpon thee: but of this one thing I can certifie thee,
that for the present thy estate is lamentable, and if this grace
goe by thee in time to come, as it hath done for the time
forepassed, it had beene better for thee that thou hadst ne|uer
beene borne.</P>
<P>The time of our calling is but short and limited, let it
not goe by vs without grace, but let vs striue to redeeme it
<PB N="388" REF="153">
It is called sometimes an acceptable yeere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time of our calling is called a yeere, a day, to tell vs it is but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> and sometimes a
day of saluation: some dayes are longer and some are shor|ter,
but they haue all an end. The lewes had a faire long
sommer day of Saluation, sixteene hundred yeeres did the
Lord offer grace to the house of <HI>Sem:</HI> but now the bright
shining Sunne of righteousnesse hath gone downe vpon
them, and darknesse is vnto them instead of diuination; and
other sixteene hundred yeeres hath the Lord been offering
grace to the house of <HI>Iapheth,</HI> perswading them by the Gos|pell
to come and dwell in the tents of <HI>Sem,</HI> and that by their
seuerall families: hee beganne at the Churches of the East;
they had their owne day, although but a short winters day
compared with that of the Iewes. From them in the East
the light is now come, praised be God, to vs in the West;
now is our day, how long it is to continue with vs who can

<P>For suppose this day of saluation were to shine vpon
this land still on to the worlds end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Grace will be offered to vs after this life.</NOTE> yet what is it to thee,
seeing the day of grace endeth to thee in the day of thy
death? after that, the Lord shall neuer any more offer mer|cy
vnto thee: in that the Apostle wils vs to doe good while
we haue time, he tels vs that after this there is no time; let
vs not thinke <HI>quod apud inferos ad faciendos fideles at&abque; libe|randos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. Euodio. Epist. 99.</NOTE>
<HI>euangelium praedicatum sit, vel adhue etiam praedicetur

ben or yet is preached in hell, to worke Faith in men there
for their deliuerance, as if there also were a constitute church
in it. Here by preaching grace is offered to thee, that if thou
wilt beleeue thou mayst be saued; but if now thou dispise it
there remaines nothing but <HI>a fearefull looking for of iudge|ment.</HI>
And no lesse deceitfull is that opinion, that by suffe|ring
hereafter thou mayst redeeme that life which here thou

<P>It is a principall pollicie of Sathan to steale away from
man the time of Grace:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathans princi|pall pollicie is to steale away from men the time of grace.</NOTE> he will not simply say to any man,
yee neede not to repent at all&punc; hee knoweth the most pro|phane
man will abhorre that, hee seekes onely a delay; thou
needest not (saith hee) to repent as yet, and so stealeth away
one day after another, till the day of Grace be gone. When
<HI>Pharaoh</HI> was stricken with Frogges, and <HI>Moses</HI> offered
to him, that when hee would bid him, hee would pray to
God that hee might be deliuered from them, it was but an
vnwise answere hee gaue him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 8. 10</NOTE> <HI>Pray for mee to morrow,</HI> it
had beene better for him to haue said, Pray for me presently:
but more miserably blinded are they, to whom the Lord
presently offers saluation, they delay not till to morrow
onely, but till the next yeere, yea, for many yeeres; they are
called vpon in their youth, but they refuse to repent till they
be old, seeking first leaue to kisse their father, that is, to fol|low
their owne pleasures, before they will resolue to follow
the Lord Iesus; and so lets their dayes one after another, be
stollen away from them, till at length they be taken away
in their sinnes, and the day of Grace be closed vpon them.</P>
<P><HI>And whom hee Called,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustification posterior to Calling in or|der, not in time</NOTE> <HI>them also hee Iustified.</HI> Hauing
spoken of our Calling, wee come now to speake of our Iu|stification.
This is a new benefit different from the former
benefit of our Calling, posterior to it in order of working
but not in time: for in the same moment wherein the Lord
by effectuall Calling giues vs faith to beleeue, he doth also
iustifie vs.</P>
<P>That wee may vnderstand what a benefit this is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The word of Iustifying three wayes taken.</NOTE> we are
to know that the word of Iustifying hath three principall
significations. First, to iustifie is all one with this, to sanctifie,<MILESTONE N="1">
or to infound by grace new qualities into the soule of man,
and so Iustification is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>seu motus ad Iustitiam,</HI> as
<PB N="390" REF="154">
<HI>Dan. 12. They who iustifie many, shall shine as Starre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> for
euer;</HI> and in this sense the Papists take it in this question,
<MILESTONE N="2"> but wrongfully.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 7. 29</NOTE> Secondly, to iustifie, is to acknowledge or
declare one to be iust: so it is said that the Publicans iusti|fied
God; of force wee must expound it, they acknowledged
or confessed him to be iust: so S. <HI>Iames</HI> saith that <HI>a man is
iustified by workes,</HI> that is, declared to be iust by his workes,
or as S. <HI>Iames</HI> expounds it himselfe, his Iustification is shew|ed
<MILESTONE N="3"> by his works. Thirdly, the word to Iustifie, is a iudiciall
terme, and it signifieth to absolue in iudgement, and is op|poned
to condemning: so <HI>Salomon</HI> vseth it, <HI>He that iustifies
the wicked, and condemnes the iust, are both alike abhominat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">on
to the Lord:</HI> and in this sense the Apostle vseth it here, for
he oppones it to condemnation.</P>
<P>This right vnderstanding of the word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustification is opponed to co~|demnation.</NOTE> will lead vs to
know what the benefit of Iustification is: for what euer con|demnation
be, Iustification must be the contrary: they are
both iudiciall termes, vsed in iudgement holden on matters
of life and death. Condemnation (no man will deny) is the
sentence of a righteous Iudge, adiudging a malefactor to
death for some capitall crime whereof hee is found guiltie
in iudgement: Iustification then is the sentence of God, a
righteous Iudge, absoluing the man that is in Christ from
sinne and death, and accepting him to life for the righteous|nesse
of Christ, which is his.</P>
<P>So that it is euident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the state of the contro|uersie of Iustifi|cation stands betweene vs and the Papists</NOTE> the state of the question in the con|trouersie
of Iustification will be this: how is a man iustified
before God? that is, what is it that a man must bring be|fore
Gods tribunall, for the which hee shall be pronoun|ced
innocent, absolued from death, and adiudged to life?
whether is it our workes of sanctification inherent in vs, or
is it the righteousnesse of Christ giuen vnto vs, and made
ours? The question being this way taken vp, shall giue great
light to the controuersie that is betweene vs and the falsely
named Catholikes of our time: for we denie not that there
is in Gods children an inherent sanctification, and that they
<PB N="391" REF="154">
are changed from vnrighteousnesse to righteousnesse, but
this inherent righteousnesse (say we) is not able to purchase
to vs an absoluitorie sentence from death.</P>
<P>To make this yet more cleare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure names giuen to that righteousnesse, by which wee are iustified.</NOTE> let vs know that the righ|teousnesse
by which wee are Iustified, receiues foure names:
first, it is called the righteousnesse of Christ: secondly, the
righteousnesse of God: thirdly, the righteousnesse of Faith:
fourthly, our righteousnesse. The righteousnesse of Christ,
because it is conquered by him, and inherent in him, as in
the proper subiect: The righteousnesse of God, because he
onely in his meruailous wisedome found it out: it is called
the righteousnesse of Faith, because Faith is the instrument
by which wee apprehend it: and it is called our righteous|nesse,
because it is giuen vnto vs of God to be ours, by im|putation
on Gods part, by acceptation of it by Faith vpon
our part, for these two wayes that acquisite righteousnesse
of Christ is made ours.</P>
<P>This wee haue to marke for our comfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conside|ration that Christs righte|ousnes is ours, stoppeth the mouth of all that impugnes our Faith.</NOTE> against those
obiections, which eyther inwardly by Sathan, or outwardly
by men of a contrary opinion are obiected vnto vs. If they
to trouble our peace, and weaken our Faith, aske, how can
yee be iustified by a righteousnesse which is not yours? we
answere, the righteousnesse of Christ is ours, and ours by
as great a right as any other thing that we possesse is ours,
to wit, by the free gift of God: seeing it hath pleased God
to giue vs a garment who were naked, and to giue vs, who
had none of our owne, a righteousnesse answerable to his
Iustice, vvhat intrest can eyther man or Angell haue to re|sist
it?</P>
<P>The euasions and obiections,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Works not of the vnregene|rate onely, but of the regene|rate also exclu|ded from the act of Iustifi|cation.</NOTE> whereby the aduersarie
impugnes this doctrine, are chiefely these: First, the Apo|stle
(say they) excludeth the works of nature, not the works
of Grace; the workes of a man vnregenerate they confesse
cannot iustifie him, but the works of a man regenerate, say
they, doe iustifie him: but this is false, as is proued first
by examples: for <HI>Abraham</HI> whose example the Apostle
<PB N="392" REF="155">
bringeth in to confirme the doctrine of Iustification, was
a regenerate man and effectually called; yet as witnesseth
both <HI>Moses</HI> and S. <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proued by ex|amples.</NOTE> his faith was counted to him for
righteousnesse. <HI>Dauid</HI> after hee had beene a regenerate man
yet saith, <HI>Lord enter not into iudgement with thy Seruant, for
in thy sight shall no flesh be iustified.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> pro|tests
of himselfe, I haue in all good conscience serued God
vnto this day; neyther know I any thing of my selfe, yet
am I not thereby iustified: hee was more abundant in good
workes than all the rest of the Apostles: hee did also beare
in his body the markes of Iesus; and was renouned through
his manifold sufferings: If euer any regenerate man could
haue beene iustified by his good workes, it was this holy
Apostle, yet hee tels you himselfe, for all that I haue done,
for all that I haue suffered, yet am I not thereby iustified.</P>
<P>The same is proued by reason:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The same pro|ued by reason.</NOTE> that which by order of
nature followes our Iustification before God, cannot be said
to iustifie vs in the presence of God; cannot be said to iusti|fie
vs in this sense: but so it is, good works by order of na|ture,
followes our iustification before God, <HI>Non praecedunt
iustificandum sed sequuntur iustificatum.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Augustine.</NOTE> Againe, such works
as are not perfectly agreeable to the rule of Legall iustice
cannot iustifie vs, but rather fals vnder that curse, <HI>Cursed is
hee who fulfilleth not euery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ot of the Law:</HI> but so it is, that the
workes euen of men regenerate, are not able to answere the

in the earth, that doth good and sinneth not. If I would dispute
with God, I could not</HI> (saith <HI>Iob) make answere vnto one of a
thousand. All our righteousnesse</HI> (saith <HI>Ieremie) is but like a
menstruous cloath:</HI> and our Sauiour hath taught euen regene|rate
men to pray daily for the remission of their sins. <HI>Quid

misericordia Dei iudicetur:</HI> woe to the righteousnesse of man
<PB N="393" REF="155">
were it neuer so lowable, if God setting aside mercy enter to
iudge it.</P>
<P>But they insist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it is that workes of men regenerate doe not merit, see|ing they are workes done in vs by the spi|rit of Christ.</NOTE> the workes of regenerate men are the
workes of Christ, for it is hee who by his spirit workes
them in them, therefore they are meritorious and iustifies. I answere, the workes of Christ iustifies, it is true, if yee vn|derstand
his personall workes, done by himselfe in his own
person; as the Apostle teacheth vs, <HI>He hath purged our sinnes
by himselfe.</HI> But as for those workes which hee workes in vs
by his spirit of grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1. 3</NOTE> hee workes them not for our iustifi|cation,
that as I haue said he hath done already by himselfe
and in his owne person, but for our sanctification. Secondly,
the good workes of men regenerate are so wrought by
Christ in vs that they are also wrought by vs, and we haue
our working in them, and therefore by reason of our im|perfection
cannot be perfect: for as the fountaines of the
actions are, so must the actions be themselues, the fountaines
are mixed being partly good, and partly euill: for our mind
is not so illuminated that there is no darknesse in it; neither
is our hart so sanctified that there is no vncleannesse in it, and
therefore the actions flowing from thence cannot be per|fect
workes of light and sanctification.</P>
<P>They insist yet further and obiects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith &amp; works are not simply opponed to other, for they are inseperable but opponed onely in the act of Iustification</NOTE> if the Apostle say
they in his conclusion, we are iustified by Faith without the
workes of the Law, did vnderstand the workes of Grace,
then it would follow that he oppones things which are not
to be opponed: for workes and Grace, workes and Faith,
workes and Christ, are not opposite but agrees very well
together, as the cause and effect, as the tree and the branch.
To this we answere that Faith and workes agrees well to|gether,
but there is no thing in the world which agree so
well the one with the other, but in some things they may be
opponed: as for example; the tree and the branch agrees
very well together, but if the question be moued whether
the tree beares the branch or the branch the tree, in this
they are opponed; that which is affirmed of the one must
<PB N="394" REF="156">
be denyed of the other. Againe, there is a very sweet har|mony
betweene a naturall Father and the sonne, the one of
them cannot be without the other: for hee is not a Father,
who neuer had a sonne; neither is he a sonne, who neuer had
a father: but if this be the question which of them gaue
beginning to another, here we must oppone them, affirm|ing
that of the one, which wee deny of the other. In like
manner there is a very sweet harmonie and agreement be|tweene
Faith and good workes; but if this be the question,
for which of them it is that God doth iustifie vs, there wee
must oppone them, affirming with the Apostle that we are
iustified by Faith, and not by workes: alway the opposition
is not simple, but <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>Their second euasion is a distinction of the workes of the
Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Workes not of the Ceremoni|all law onely but of the Mo|rall also exclu|ded from Iusti|fication.</NOTE> Morall and Ceremoniall. It is true say they that the
workes of the law ceremoniall iustifies not, but the workes
of the Law Morall iustifies. But the Apostle in his con|clusion
excludes from iustification the workes of the Law
Morall, for these reasons: he excludes those workes of which
he hath proued both Iewes and Gentiles to be guiltie, but
so it is he hath proued them to be guiltie of the transgressi|on
of the Law Morall, as is euident out of the sins where|with
he charges them, therefore, &amp;c. Secondly, he excludes
from iustification the workes of that law by which comes
the knowledge of sinne; but so it is the knowledge of sinne
comes by the law Morall, therefore, &amp;c. <HI>I had not kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">wne</HI>
(saith the Apostle) <HI>that concup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">cence is a sinne, except the
law had said thou shalt not couet.</HI> Now it is euident that this
is a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ecept of the law Morall.</P>
<P>Their third euasion is by a distinction of the first and se|cond
iustification,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The distincti|on of the first and second Iustification improued.</NOTE> the first whereof say they is by Faith,
but the second is by workes. But this twofold iustification
is also forged: for <HI>iustificatio est actus indiuidius &amp; simul totus,</HI>
there is no first and last in the act of iustification: hee that
is once condemned iudicially stands so, and hee that is ab|solued
stands so. Againe, this distinction confounds two
<PB N="395" REF="156">
benefits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustification &amp; Sanctification distinct bene|fits.</NOTE> iustification &amp; sanctification&punc; which to them is the
second iustification. That they are distinct benefits the A|postle
doth teach vs, Christ is made to vs righteousnesse and
sanctification; but they inconsiderately confound them: for
if these new qualities infused by Grace into the soule of
man, and good workes flowing there from be the matter as
they say of mans second Iustification, then let them tell vs
what is the matter of his sanctification.</P>
<P>To conclude this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustification &amp; Sanctification inseperably conioyned.</NOTE> these are two inseperable benefits, to
whomsoeuer the Lord imputes the righteousnes of Christ,
and giues them Faith to accept it as their owne, like as for
it hee absolues them from sinne and death, and adiudges
them vnto life; so also incontinent workes he in them by his
holy spirit, an inherent righteousnesse, by which they be|come
new creatures: so that our iustification hath insepe|rably
annexed with it sanctification. But this sanctification
of our<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> is so imperfect, that howsoeuer it be accepted of the
Father for the righteousnesse of Christ, yet is it not so per|fect
nor sufficient that for the merit thereof wee dare seeke
to be absolued from our sinnes, and receiued into fauour.</P>
<P><HI>Them he also glorefied.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Glorification our last and highest estate out of which we shall neuer be changed.</NOTE> Glorification the last lincke of the
chaine is the last and highest benefit that we haue by Christ,
by which both our soule and body shall be restored to a

had this inward glory, that he was created to the image of

ouer all the crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ures of God: the heauens were made
beautifull for his sake; the earth made fruitfull; Paradise
assigned to him as a speciall garden of pleasure, and all the
creatures ordained to serue him: but by our second creation
we are beautified with more excellent priuiledges; that same
image is restored to vs; new heauens and new earth created
for our sake, and with all these we shall haue the Crowne
of perseuerance, which <HI>Adam</HI> had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">: for glorification is

our last and highest happie estate, out of which wee shall

<P>And herein appeares the Lords wonderfull power and
goodnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the glori|fication of our bodyes shewes Gods wonder|full goodnesse and power.</NOTE> who of the fall of man takes occasion to make
man better than hee was before the fall. Our bodyes shall
not be raised like to <HI>Adams</HI> body, for euen in the state of
innocencie hee was mortall; but they shall be raised vp like
to the glorious body of Christ. <HI>Salomon</HI> built a Temple,
the Chaldeans destroyed it, and it was neuer againe resto|red
to the former glory, which moued the auncient men to
mourne, when they saw how the glory of the second Tem|ple
was not like the glory of the first; but it shall be the
great ioy of our auncient Father <HI>Adam,</HI> when hee shall see
how farre the glory of the second creation shall exceed the
glory of the first.</P>
<P>Of this Glorification the Apostle speakes in the time
past,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three degrees of eternall life.</NOTE> partly to declare the certainetie thereof, and partly, be|cause
it is already begunne: for there are three degrees of
that Glory. The first in this life, and that is our sanctifica|tion,
called by S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> the first resurrection, and by S. <HI>Paul</HI>
our transformation into the glorious image of God. The
second is in the houre of death, and that is a neerer vnion of
our soules with Iesus. The third will be in the last day, wher|in
both soule and body shall be glorified; this is the highest
step of <HI>Salomons</HI> throne, vnto the which we must ascend by
the former degrees.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first de|gree is in this life, &amp; hath in it these three. 1. Righteousnes 2. Peac. 3. Ioy.</NOTE> As for the beginning of this glory, which
now wee haue, it consists in these three; Righteousnesse,
Peace, and Ioy: there is a ioy which is no presumption,
flowing from a peace which is not securitie, bred of righte|ousnesse
which is not hypocrisie: in these three stands the
beginning of eternall life here vpon earth, and in the perfe|ction
of them shall consist the perfection of eternall life af|terward
in heauen: perseuerance in righteousnesse, peace,
ioy and glory being adioyned vnto them.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="157">
This Ioy which is the highest degree of eternall life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A three-fold ioy we haue in this life.</NOTE> wee
can attaine to here vpon earth, hath also these three de|grees:
first, there is a Ioy which ariseth of beleeuing, <HI>wee
haue not as yet seen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Lord Iesus; yet doe wee beleeue in
him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 1.</NOTE> <HI>and reioyce in him with Ioy vnspeakeable and glorious.</HI>
Secondly, there is a Ioy which ariseth of feeling and tasting,
<HI>taste and consider how gratious the Lord is,</HI> and this feeling
is much more than beleeuing. Thirdly, there is a ioy which
ariseth of sight and of spirituall embracing; such vvas the
ioy of <HI>Simeon</HI> when hee saw that promised saluation, and
embraced the Lord Iesus in his armes.</P>
<P>Hereof ariseth to vs first a lesson of comfort:<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the ioyfull first fruites of eternall life, we may iudge of the fulnesse thereof.</NOTE> if the be|ginnings
of this glory be so great, that as S. <HI>Peter</HI> saith, they
bring to vs ioy vnspeakable and glorious, what shall the ful|nesse
thereof be? let this waken in vs a loathing of these

essent haec terrena, tamen prae coelestibus essent commu|tanda,</HI>
Certainely albeit these earthly things were eternall,
yet were they to be exchanged with those that are heauenly.
And therefore let the little tast of that ioy which wee haue
now worke in vs a greater hunger and thirst after the fulnes
thereof.</P>
<P>And againe we are here to be remembred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This ioy is not found but in the depth of a contr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e heart.</NOTE> that as pearles
are found in the bottome of the water, and gold is not got|ten
in the superfice, but bosome of the earth: so this ioy is
not to be found but in the inward parts of a broken and
contrite spirit: many speake of this ioy who neuer felt it.
Righteousnesse is the mother of Peace, and Peace the mo|ther
of Ioy: they who haue not learned to do well, and can|not
morne for the euil which they haue done, how shall they
taste of the ioyes of God? wee must pearce by the hammer

life is not begunne but after death, but assuredly except
now thou get the beginnings, thou shalt neuer hereafter
attaine to the perfections thereof, and therefore looke to
it in time.</P>
<P>As for the second degree of this glory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the second and third de|gree of eternall Life.</NOTE> which is a neerer
vnion of our soules with Iesus Christ after our dissolution
by death, it is not my purpose now to insist in it. As for
the third degree which consists in the glorification both of
our soules and bodyes, we haue spoken of it before, speci|ally
in the 18. verse. Now the Tabernacle of God is with
men, but then shall our securitie be without feare, and
our glory consummated, when we shall dwell in
the Tabernacle of God: vnto the which
the Lord bring vs all for Iesus

<P>_NOW followes the conclusion
of the whole Chapter:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conclusio~ of the whole Chapter, con|sisting first of a generall, se|condly of a particular tri|umph.</NOTE> where|in
the Apostle breaking off the
course of his former speach,
gathers vp all that he hath spo|ken
into a short summe, he be|gan
at the first and lowest be|nefite
which God in Christ
hath bestowed vpon vs, to wit,
deliuerance from condemnati|on:
this is indeede the least of his mercies, yet so great that
if we had receiued no more, we are neuer able to yeeld vn|to
the Lord that praise which is due for it. Yet as I said it is
but little in respect of that which God hath done vnto vs,
<PB N="400" REF="162">
and therefore the Apostle beginning at it ascends continu|ally
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll he comes to the last and highest, which is our estate
of glorification; and so hauing tunne so high in the enume|ration
of Gods mercies towards vs that he can go no higher,
he bursts out into an exclamation, as if he did say, more can|not
be spoken, further comfort cannot be giuen, but con|tents
himselfe to make a briefe recapitulation of all that hee
had said; wherein first he triumphs generally, verse 31. &amp; 32,
thereafter perticularly: and that first against sinne, <HI>Who
shall accuse, who shall condemne?</HI> verse 33. 34. Secondly a|gainst
affliction, <HI>who shall seperate vs from the loue of God?</HI>
outward and visible enimies cannot doe it, by no sort of trou|ble,
verse 35. 36. 37. Inward and inuisible enimies are not
able to doe it, verse 38. 39. Thus like a valiant man stabli|shed
on Christ, in his owne name, and in the name of the
rest of Gods children, hee proclaimes a de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iance to all his
enimies visible and inuisible whatsoeuer.</P>
<P>The generall triumph contayned in these two verses con|sists
in these two.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first part of his generall triumph, no|thing can bee against the Christian to hurt him.</NOTE> In the first he glories that nothing can be
against the Christian to hurt him, the reason is, because
God is with him. In the second he glories that the Christian
can want nothing that is needfull for him, the reason is, seeing
the Lord hath giuen vnto vs his owne sonne, which is the
greatest gift, that can be giuen, he will not let vs want any
of his inferiour gifts.</P>
<P><HI>If God be on our side.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Worldlings euill iudges of Gods presence who measure it by externall prosperitie.</NOTE> His meaning is if God be with vs,
electing, calling, and iustifying vs, that he may glorifie vs, as
hath beene said, then we may be sure that nothing can be
against vs. This I marke because worldlings iudge of Gods
presence with men by the wrong rules, to wit, as <HI>Abimelech</HI>
and <HI>philoc</HI> iudged of <HI>Abraham, we see</HI> say they <HI>that God is
with thee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 25. 22.</NOTE> <HI>because thou prosperest in all that thou doest.</HI> That
which they iudged was true, for GOD was present with
<HI>Abraham</HI> indeed, but the rule by which they so iudged was
not sure: for if this rule were sure, how often might the
wicked be iudged to be blessed? who prosper in all they put
<PB N="401" REF="162">
their hand vnto:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not by in|ward Grace.</NOTE> the rich glut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">on might be thought more
happy than poore <HI>Lazarus:</HI> but the presence wherof the A|postle
speaks is not to be tryed by grace, which grace flow|ing
from thy effectuall calling, is a surer argument to proue
that God is with thee, then if he should giue thee, as he did
<HI>Esau,</HI> the fatnesse of the earth for thy portion, and multi|ply
vpon thee in neuer so great aboundance the things of
this world.</P>
<P>And that we should not be deceiued to iudge otherwise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The presence of God ex|empts not his children from trouble both inward and outward.</NOTE>
our blessed Sauiour hath forewarned vs both by his word
and example, how that great troubles outward and inward
are to follow them which follow him. <HI>In the world</HI> (sayth he)
<HI>yee shall haue trouble, in me yee shall haue peace.</HI> So soone as
our Sauiour was borne <HI>Herod</HI> raged against him, seeking his
life; to warne vs saith <HI>Chrisostome,</HI> that so soone as wee are
borne Christians wee should looke for trouble: <HI>Iacob</HI> gat
no sooner the blessing but incontinent <HI>Esau</HI> persecutes him.
<HI>Sosthenes</HI> before he was a Christian was a ruler of a Syna|gogue,
but after that he imbraced the Faith of Christ, they
depriued him of his office, and scourged him. <HI>Paul</HI> a per|secuter
is in great worldly honour, commissioner of the
high Priest and Elders of Ierulal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m; but when he becomes a
Preacher, his former friends becomes his enimies. The same
is also true in inward tentations: when our Sauiour beganne
to discharge the publicke office of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> sathan began
to tempt him: of his two most excellent Apostles, the one
was winnowed by Sathan, the other buffeted by the Angell
of Sathan&punc; and all to tell vs that notwithstanding the Lord
be present with vs, yet we may be tempted as our Sauiour
was, winnowed as <HI>Peter</HI> was, buffeted as <HI>Paul</HI> was; and
therefore let vs dispise the iudgement of worldlings, and
lying conclusions of Sathan, who would make vs to esteeme
our inward and outward tentations to be tokens and argu|ments
of Gods departure from vs.</P>
<P>Againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole world consists of two contra|ry factions</NOTE> perceiue here hovv in the vvorld are two con|trary

by the word of God doe we exhort you which are on Gods
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ide to gather you together into one, not that it is possible ye
can be seperate from them in this life in regard of personall
conuersation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5. 10.</NOTE> for so saith the Apostle, <HI>ye behoued to goe out of
the world,</HI> but that by difference of your words and deedes
from them, yee declare that ye are not of their communion.</P>
<P>They who are one the side of Iesus are knowne chiefely
these two manner of wayes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why all the followers of Christ are pursued of Sa|than with rest|lesse malice.</NOTE> First, Sathan fights against
them: Secondly, they are also warriours against him: the
first without the second is nothing; for man euen as hee is
a naturall man is an obiect of Sathans malice, but where the
grace of God hath made the man a new creature, there Sa|than
doubles his hatred; for hee enuies most the glory of
Gods mercy, whereof hee knowes he shall neuer be perta|ker.
As <HI>Nabuchadnezers</HI> countenance changed, and his
<PB N="403" REF="163">
rage encreased when the three Children refused in his face
to worship his image, and thereupon commaunded to make
his Ouen seauen times hotter than it was before: so is Sa|thans
malice most intended against those who plainly re|fuse
to fall downe and worship him.</P>
<P>But that the godly be not discouraged with his malice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ort christians haue of this that they finde Sa|than an enimie to them.</NOTE>
let vs remember that first hee was an enimie vnto God, or
euer he was an enimie vnto vs, and that wee haue cause to
reioyce in that we finde that Apostate spirit an enimie vnto
vs, whom God from the beginning hath proclaymed to be
an enimie vnto himselfe. Secondly, we are to collect of his
inuasion and our resistance that there is in vs some measure
of the grace of Iesus Christ: for against those doth he mul|tiply
his malitious assaults, on whom hee sees that the Lord
hath multiplyed his graces: like to a crafitie Pirate, who pas|sing
by the emptie vessell, sets vpon that which is loadned.
Thirdly, howeuer he being compared with vs hath many
vantages; as that he is more subtile in nature, being of grea|ter
experience and more auncient, being now almost sixe
thousand yeeres old: and hath also vantage of place; for he
is the Prince of the Aire, assisted with armies of spirituall
wickednesse, who for their number are legions, for their
strength principalities &amp; powers, for their subtiltie serpents,
for their fiercenesse dragons: yet stronger is he who is on
our side, than they who are against vs; the serpents head is
bruised, some life remaines in him, but hee hath no power
to inflict death on them which are in Christ.</P>
<P>But what euer inimitie Sathan exercise against vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If so be that they also liue at inimity with Sathan.</NOTE> it is not
sufficient to comfort vs, vnlesse wee also liue as enimies vnto
him. It was a notable speach of <HI>Azariah</HI> to Prophet to
<HI>Asa, the Lord is with you, while yee be with him:</HI> if thou
stand with the compleat armour of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chro. 15. 2</NOTE> pleading the cause
of God, fighting against the enimie of God, than mayst thou
say in a good conscience, God is with thee, and thou art with
him. But alas we see in this generation many wearing Christs
liuerie, and bearing Sathans armour, professing friendship
<PB N="404" REF="164">
to Christ yet fighting against him: these two factions are
entred already into the battaile <HI>pelmell,</HI> so that in the smallest
fellowships some ye shall finde aduancing the kingdome of
the one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This comfort taken from car|nall men who professe friend|ship to Christ, and are ser|uants to Sathan</NOTE> though very few to fight for the glory of the other.
What a shame is this for vs, who say we are on the Lords
side, that a wicked man seruing Sathan shall in our audience
open his mouth to blaspheme God, and we will not open
our mouthes to rebuke him? we see carnall men so shame|lesse
that they stand vpon no circumstances to dishonour
God, and we who professe we loue him, for feare wee faile
against curtesie, and I cannot tell what circumstances, dare
not open our mouthes to praise him. Our coldnesse in this
point hath neede to be admonished, that we may be stirred
vp not by profession onely, but by conuersation also, to
make it knowen to the world, that wee belong wholy to
the Lord Iesus.</P>
<P><HI>Who can be against vs?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Christian wants not eni|mies.</NOTE> It may seeme strange that the
Apostle should vse any such interroga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orie: what Christian
wants enimies inough against him? yea saith not the Apo|stle
of himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 15. 32</NOTE> that hee had beasts at <HI>Ephesus</HI> with whom
he behoued to fight? was there not an Angell of Sathan
sent to buffet him?<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 12. 7.</NOTE> did not <HI>Nero</HI> at length behead him?
how is it then that he askes who can be against him? But
wee are to know that the Apostles meaning is not that
godly men haue no enimies, but that no enimie can take
from vs that for which wee striue:<NOTE PLACE="marg">But none of them can take from vs that for which we striue.</NOTE> it is not for the mainte|nance
of our bodily life that wee fight, when our enimies
haue taken that from vs, they haue done no more than <HI>Po|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iphars</HI>
wife did to <HI>Ioseph,</HI> when she pulled the garment from
him. There are three notable things for which we striue,
and which the world is neuer able to take from vs: the
loue of God which he hath borne to vs: the grace of God
which hee hath communicated to vs in our calling: the
glory of God and eternall life, which hereafter doth abide
vs: no power of man nor Angell is able to depriue vs of
these things.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="164">
An example whereof we haue in that notable warriour
of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is decla|red in the ex|ample of Iob.</NOTE> Patient <HI>Iob,</HI> whom the Lord set vp as an obiect of
all Sathans buffets, and against whom hee was permitted
to vse all the strategems of the spirituall warfare that pos|sibly
hee could: hee crossed him not onely in his goods, in
his children, and in his owne body, but also in his minde;
by his wife hee tempted him to blasphemie; by his friends
to diffidence; yet by none of these could hee ouercome him:
In his outward troubles his resolution was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 1. 21.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord hath
giuen, the Lord hath taken, blessed be the name of the Lord
for euer:</HI> in his inward terrours his resolution was, <HI>Albeit
the Lord would slay me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 13. 15.</NOTE> <HI>yet would I trust in him:</HI> so impossi|ble
is it for Sathan by any tentation whatsoeuer, to seperate
from the loue of God, his Children, chosen, called, and iu|stified.</P>
<P>To cleare this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord is present with his children to keepe them, somtime from trouble, some|time in trouble</NOTE> let vs yet know that God is many manner
of wayes present with his children in trouble: first, hee is
with them by preuenting the danger, so that hee will not
suffer the intended euill of the enimie to come neere them:
so he brought <HI>Senacherib</HI> to see Ierusalem without, but suf|fered
him not to shoot so much as a dart against it within.
Somtime again the Lord enters his children into the trouble,
as <HI>Daniel</HI> into the den, <HI>Ioseph</HI> into the prison, the three Chil|dren
into the fire; but deliuers them in such sort that both his
glory, and their comfort is greater than if they had not
beene in trouble at all: Sometime hee suffers his children
to end their mortall liues in trouble, and yet is with them
strengthening them by his glorious might to all patience
and long suffering, filling them with such a sense of his
loue, that in death they rest vnder the assurance of life.</P>
<P>The practise of this see in the examples of <HI>Eliah</HI> and
<HI>Paul:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This also is de|clared by ex|amples.</NOTE> when <HI>Iezabel</HI> vowed to haue the life of <HI>Eliah,</HI> yee
shall see that the Lord is with him, sometime to hide him,
that albeit <HI>Achab</HI> and <HI>Iezabel</HI> seeke him they cannot finde
him: sometime God lets <HI>Achabs</HI> captaines see where hee
is, but consumes with fire them that came proudly to take
<PB N="406" REF="165">
him: Sometime hee presents him to <HI>Achab</HI> and <HI>Iezabel,</HI> but
bridleth the tyrants that they haue no power to stirre him.
The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in like manner being sent prisoner to
Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. 4. 17.</NOTE> the Lord assisted him in such sort that hee deliuered
him out of the mouth of the Lyon <HI>Nero;</HI> and yet the second
time suffered him to fall by the sword of the same tyrant:
shall wee thinke that the Lord was not with the Apostle
to assist him the second time as well as the first? let it be
farre from vs. The Lord was with him indeed to make his
death a seale and confirmation of that Gospell which hee
had preached in his life. The comfort then remaines, that
howeuer God worke with his children in trouble, no ad|uersarie
is able to take from vs that for which wee striue, to
wit, grace, and glory, they may be vnto vs as the sharpe
rasers of God, to cut away our superfluities, but shall neuer
be able to bereaue vs of the end of our Faith, which is the
euerlasting saluation of our soules.</P>

<Q>Who spared not his owne Sonne, but gaue
him for vs all vnto death, how shall he not with him
giue vnto vs all things also?</Q></HEAD>
<P>_NOw followeth the second part of the Apo|stles
generall triumph,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second part of his ge|nerall triumph, the Christian can want no|thing that is needfull for him.</NOTE> wherein hee gloryeth
that the Christian can want nothing needfull
for him; for seeing the Lord hath giuen vnto
him, the greatest, and most excellent gift, to
wit, his owne Sonne, is it possible that he will denie him any
secondary or inferior gifts needfull for him? Sathan who is
a lyer from the beginning, accused the Lord of two things:
first, of an vntruth: albeit the Lord hath said it, yet <HI>ye shall
not dye:</HI> secondly, of Enuy. In the first Sathan is proued
false and the Lord is found true: for are they not dead to
whom the Lord said, <HI>yee shall dye?</HI> In the second Sathan is
found a calumniator: for what good tree will the Lord
<PB N="407" REF="165">
refuse to his owne, who hath giuen vnto them this excellent
tree of life, which brings with it vnto them all things need|full
for them.</P>
<P>To amplifie this great loue of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great loue which God hath shewed in giuing his Son for vs.</NOTE> the Apostle saith
not simply, that hee gaue his Sonne for vs, but that hee spa|red
not to giue him. O wonderfull loue! the Naturall
and onely Sonne of God is not spared, that the adoptiue
sonnes may be spared: for our sins being imputed to him
by the ordinance of God his Father, and voluntarily accep|ted
by himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 53. 5.</NOTE> <HI>so the punishment of our sinnes and chastice|ment
of our peace was laid vpon him, that by his stripes wee
might be healed.</HI> The bitter cuppe due to vs was propined
to him, for the which albeit hee prayed to his Father, that
<HI>if it were his will,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26. 39.</NOTE> <HI>this cuppe might passe by him,</HI> yet the Fa|ther
spared him not, but held it to his head, till hee dranke
out the vttermost dregs thereof. So straite is the Iustice of
God, that sinne being imputed to the Sonne of God, who
had no sinne of his owne, is pursued to the vttermost. The
greatest example of Iustice that euer the Lord declared in
the world, the drowning of the originall world, the burning
of Sodome; the plaguing of Egypt; were terrible proofes of
the straitnesse of diuine Iustice, but nothing comparable to
this.</P>
<P>Which I marke partly for a comfort to the Godly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort for the Godly that the iustice of God shall not, nay cannot strike vpon them.</NOTE> and
partly for a warning to the wicked: it is our great comfort,
that the saluation which Iesus hath purchased vnto vs, hee
hath obtained it with a full satisfaction of his Fathers Iu|stice,
so that now wee that are in him, are not any more
to feare it. The great Iudge of all the world will not doe
vnrighteously, to require that againe from vs, which our
Christ, whom hee himselfe hath giuen vnto vs, hath payed
for vs.</P>
<P>And as for the wicked who are not in Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miserable are the wicked who in their owne persons beare the punishment of their sinnes.</NOTE> how mi|serable
will their state and condition be, for they must beare
the punishment of their owne sinnes in their owne persons?
If the burden of that wrath due to our sinnes, caused Iesus
<PB N="408" REF="166">
to sweat bloud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26. 38.</NOTE> and to say, that his soule was heauy vnto
the very death. O how shall the burden of this wrath presse
downe the wicked! it is euen a horrour to think of it: their
faces shall be confused without, and their spirits oppressed
within, with tribulation and anguish; hee that spared not
in his owne Sonne sinne imputed vnto him, will hee spare
in thee sinne committed by thy selfe? no, no, when he be|ginneth
to smite thee, hee shall neuer lift vp his hand from
thee, but double his stripes vpon thee, and there shall be
no end of thy sorrow. As the ioyes prepared for the godly,
so the paines prepared for the wicked, are such as the eye
neuer saw, the tongue cannot vtter, nor the heart conceiue.
That place of the damned is the great deepe, the Ocean of
all the iudgements of God, all his temporall plagues are
but like little ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ers and strands running into it.</P>
<P>If therefore the beautie of Sion doth not allure vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How both Si|ons beautie &amp; Sinaies terror should moue vs to repent.</NOTE> let the
terrour of Sinai afray vs. The Lord proclaimed his Law in
a fearefull manner vpon mount Sinai, but in a more terrible
manner will hee execute it: if <HI>Moses</HI> who was so familiar
with the Lord, trembled when hee heard it proclaimed,
what horrible feare shall ouer-take the wicked when they
shall see it executed vpon themselues? Let therefore the
children of wisedome hearken in time to the ioyfull tidings
of peace which are daily proclaimed on mount Sion; let vs
drinke of the still and peaceable waters of Siloh, which flow

<P><HI>His owne Sonne.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Christ is Gods owne Sonne.</NOTE> Iesus Christ is called Gods owne Son

<HI>But gaue him for vs all.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The price of our redempti|on tels how much the Lord hath esteemed of vs.</NOTE> This is very often alleadged in
holy Scriptures, as an argument of the great loue of God
toward vs, <HI>that he gaue his sonne to death for vs:</HI> and so it is
indeed, for <HI>it is not by any corruptible thing, as Gold and siluer
that he hath redeemed vs, but by the precious blood of his owne
Sonne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1. 18.</NOTE> <HI>the Lambe vndefiled, and without spot.</HI> There is no
man will giue much for that whereof he esteemes but little,
we measure the price of a thing according to the worth of
it in our iudgement: euen so of the greatnesse of that gift
which our God hath giuen for vs, wee may estimate the
greatnesse of his affection toward vs. <HI>Pretious indeed in the
sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints:</HI> who to redeeme vs
from death spared not to giue his dearest sonne vnto the
death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 22. 12.</NOTE> It was the Lords reasoning to <HI>Abraham, now I per|ceiue
thou louest mee, because for my sake thou hast not spared
thine onely sonne:</HI> and haue we not much more cause to turne
ouer the same reasoning to the Lord; now Lord we perceiue
thou louest vs, because for our sake thou hast not spared thine
onely one sonne. The Lord shed abroad in our hearts more
aboundantly the sense of that inestimable loue, that we may
be carefull to requite the kindnesse of the Lord, putting his
holy will before all things in our affection, and endeauou|ring
in holy loue to serue him, who hath saued vs.</P>
<P><HI>Shall hee not with him giue vs all things also?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All things be|long to the godly in regard of right, albeit not in regard of possession.</NOTE> Wee are to
vnderstand all things that are needfull for vs: And here it is
necessary that we put a difference betweene our right and
our possession. The children of God haue the right and
propertie of all Gods good creatures, for Christ their Lord
is the heire of all, and hath made them with himselfe fellow
heires:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">5.</NOTE> <HI>All things are yours</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>and yee are
Christs, and Christ is Gods.</HI> But as for the possession of them,
the Lord giues it or with-holds it, according as hee sees may
be for the good of his children. We know our father <HI>Abra|ham</HI>
had the right of Canaan when he had not the posses|sion
of it, and are not therefore to thinke it strange that the
Lord giues not alwayes possession of that to his Children
<PB N="410" REF="167">
whereof they haue the right. But as for the wicked they haue
possession without a right, and therefore shall be punished
as theeues and robbers, and violent vsurpers of Gods crea|tures,
whereunto Iesus Christ who is the heyre of all hath
neuer giuen them a right.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seeing all things are gi|uen by God, let vs moderate our care, and take nothing but out of his fatherly hand.</NOTE> wee marke here that the giuing and dispensa|tion
of earthly things is from God; if wee could remember
this it would moderate our care, and make vs in our callings
first to seeke the Lords blessing, loath any manner of way
to take the things of this world, vnlesse we see they be giuen
vs out of the hand of God. For we are to know that Sathan
who is a counterfaiter of God, doth also arrogate to himself,
though falsely, to be the giuer of things: hee that durst say
to the sonne of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 4. 9.</NOTE> <HI>all the kingdomes of the earth are mine,
I will giue them to thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me:</HI>
will hee stand in awe to speake it vnto sinnefull man? No
indeed, it is his daily tentation, by which he circumuents ma|ny,
intangling their hearts with the loue of worldly gaine,
that to obtaine it they care not to lye, to steale, to sweare,
to oppresse, to deceiue one another: which in effect is to
fall downe before Sathan and worship him.</P>
<P>Thus Sathan rules in the kingdome of Babell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathan another Nabuchadne|zer, and a Ba|lak, offers also gifts to men.</NOTE> like a spiri|tuall <HI>Nabuchadnezar,</HI> presenting to his subiects his great

that is, worldly pleasures, vvealth, and prosperitie,
which bewitch the simple and makes them fall downe and
worship, yeelding themselues seruants to <HI>Mammon.</HI> But
happy are those children who refuse so to do, and can stand
vp vvith their father <HI>Abraham,</HI> lifting vp his hand to hea|uen
can say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 14. 22.</NOTE> <HI>I will not haue so much as the latchet of a shoe

<P><PB N="411" REF="167">

with the Apostle in whatsoeuer state we are to be content,
remembring that euery mans portion of vvorldly things is
measured vnto him from the Lord. We see that a steward

aged and the young, the seruant and the Lord receiues not
a like portion, yet no man gainsayes it; and shall vve not re|uerence
the Lords dispensation, who is the great steward of
his familie in heauen and earth, shall vve murmure against
him if he giue <HI>Beniamin</HI> a double portion, and bestow vpon
some of his children these worldly things in greater aboun|dance
than he doth vpon others? farre be it from vs: for he
dispenses these perishing things in great vvisedome and loue
toward vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He hath no cause to com|plaine to who~ the father hath giuen his Son for an irreuo|cable gift.</NOTE> as hee seeth may be best for vs. Certainely
vve ought so to reioyce in that great gift the Lord Iesus,

expedient to hold from vs. Oh that vve could giue vnto the

<P>And further seeing all these things are dispensed and
giuen by God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our care and labour is but vaine without his blessing.</NOTE> let vs (as I said) in our callings aboue all
things seeke his blessing. <HI>Adam</HI> may make himselfe a gar|ment,

able to compasse things by his owne wit. This care is not
vnprofitable onely but full of many perturbations, for which
our Sauiour compares it to thornes, which are most easily

<P>Last of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ is the chiefe gift, all other gifts are but pendicles giuen with him</NOTE> it is to be marked here that the Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aith

manner of way triumphs? Is it not <HI>Paul,</HI> who before his
conuersion was a persecuter, a blasphemer, and an oppres|ser,
who confesseth himselfe to be the chiefe of all sinners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Tim. 1. 15.</NOTE>
and the least of all Saints? yea indeed the same is hee:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 9.</NOTE> but
marke, such a one hee was indeed, but hath gotten mercy,
and therefore now like a man relieued of a heauy burthen,
which before oppressed him, hee reioyces and triumphes.
Certainely no greater comfort can come to man, than to
feele his sins forgiuen him, this onely causeth true reioycing.
<PB N="414" REF="169">
See this in <HI>Dauid,</HI> as long as the burden of his sinne lay
vpon his conscience, it prest out the very naturall moy|sture
of his body; hee had no rest night nor day, but from
the time that once <HI>Nathan</HI> proclaimed to him remission,
and that in his owne conscience he felt his sin forgiuen him,
then hee cryed out:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32. 1.</NOTE> <HI>O blessed is the man whose wickednesse
is forgiuen, whose sinne is couered, and vnto whom the Lord
imputes not his iniquitie.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 5. 25.</NOTE> As hee that lay sicke sixe and thirty
yeeres of the palsie, arose with great ioy when Iesus relieved
him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts. 3. 8.</NOTE> and hee that was a creple, when hee found that his
feete, which had failed him so long, did not serue him, lea|ped
for ioy, and followed the Apostles into the Temple to
praise God: so that soule which findes it selfe freed from
the guiltinesse and seruitude of sinne, of all burthens that
euer lay vpon man the heauiest to beare, will with much
more abundant ioy exult and triumph in that mercy of
God which hath made it free.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both by pro|mises and ex|amples doth the Lord con|firme poore pe|nitent sinners.</NOTE> let the Apostle here stand vnto vs as an exam|ple
of the like mercy of God to be shewed vpon our selues,
how great sinners soeuer wee haue beene, if wee follow him
in the like faith and repentance. The Lord our God, is not
content by his word to promise mercy vnto penitent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">in|ners,
but also confirmes vs by the examples of his manifold
mercies shewed to others before vs: when wee looke vpon
them, let our weakenesse be strengthened; let vs not think
that the Lord will close that doore of mercy vpon vs, if we
knock aright, which hee hath opened to so many before vs;
hee who hath beene found of them who sought him not,
will hee hide himselfe form vs, if forsaking our sinnes wee
seeke him in spirit and truth? Let his mercies shewed to o|thers
be vnto vs as <HI>cordes of Loue</HI> to draw vs among the
rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 11. 4.</NOTE> and like oyntments powred out, the sweet smell wherof
may delight vs to run after him: for that meeknesse which is
in thee O Lord Iesus, we wil follow thee, we haue heard that
thou despisedst not the poore sinner; thou abhorredst not
the penitent theefe; nor the sinfull woman that powred out
<PB N="415" REF="169">

<P>But wee are to marke that before the Apostle came to
this triumphing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apostle fought long be|fore he came to triumph.</NOTE> hee was long exercised with fighting; he
confesseth to the Corinthians that his preaching was a|mong
them in great feare and trembling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 2. 3.</NOTE> that in his perso|nall
conuersation hee was beaten and buffeted with an An|gell
of Sathan; that hee had terrours within and fightings
without: and what terrours are wee to thinke did trouble
him? out of doubt the sight of his sinnes, the greatnesse of
the iudgement to come did terrifie him, whereof we are war|ned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How can they triumph that haue not. fought nor re|sisted so much as to shedding of teares, farre lesse to the shedding of blood.</NOTE>
how wee must fight before wee triumph, and mourne
before the Lord comfort vs: if we cannot triumph with the
Apostle, it is because we haue not foughten with the Apo|stle:
for let be that we haue not yet resisted vnto the bloud,
how many among vs can say that they haue resisted vnto
the teares, that is, who striues with God as <HI>Iacob</HI> did with
prayers and teares to obtaine a blessing? Carelesse securitie
hath farre ouer-gone vs, and wee are become like those A|malekits,
who returning from the spoyle of Ziklag and sup|posing
they were past all danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 30. 16.</NOTE> cast their armour from
them, and spread themselues, abroad into the fields to eate,
and drinke, and to sport themselues, when in the meane time
the deuouring sword vnlooked for came vpon them. It fa|reth
euen so with the multitude of this generation, they are
become so carelesse in the spirituall warfare, that as if there
were no more battels to be foughten, they walke without
the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mour of God, and spread themselues abroad in the
fields of fleshly pleasures, and so not onely makes themselues
a pray to their deuouring enimie, but defrauds their soules
of that inward ioy arising of spirituall victory, which they
<PB N="416" REF="170">
who continue in fighting findes at the end of euery battell.</P>
<P>Now to enter into the words.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tongue of the wicked is a fornace of fire wherein the godly are tryed</NOTE> The Apostle conioynes
these two interrogations together very conueniently, <HI>Who
will accuse? who will condemne?</HI> because howeuer there be
many forward enough to accuse vs, there is none who haue
power to condemne vs. It is not the Apostles meaning that
wee shall want accusations: for the world, Sathan, and our
owne conscience shall not cease to accuse vs. <HI>Laban</HI> searched
narrowly <HI>Iacobs</HI> stuffe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For sometime they accuse them publikely &amp; in iudgeme~t.</NOTE> to see if hee could get any thing
wherewith to charge him, but more narrowly doe world|lings
search the words and deedes of the Christian, seeking

yet vpon shadowes of euill they are bold to publish false
reports, or at least by priuate surmisings seekes to disgrace
them. <HI>Moses</HI> a man approued of God, yet accused as an v|surper:
<HI>Ieremie</HI> the Prophet, albeit he so loued his country
people, that in secret his soule mourned for their desolation
yet did they accuse him of treason, alledging that hee had
made defection to the king of Babell: <HI>Daniel</HI> a man belo|ued
of God, accused and condemned of <HI>Darius</HI> his coun|sellers,
as a rebell to the King: the Israelites who returned
from captiuitie accused by <HI>Tobie</HI> and <HI>Sanballat</HI> of sedition:
the Christians of the primitiue Church oppressed with hor|rible
slanders. The first weapon wherewith Sathan fights
against the Godly, is the tongues of the wicked: for hee
looseth their tongues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o speake euill, before hee loose their
hands to doe euill to them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. confes. lib. 10.</NOTE> therfore said <HI>Augustine, Lingua

a daily fornace, wherein the Godly are tryed: let no man
thinke to serue God in a good conscience, but hee must be
purged in this ouen, <HI>ye are not of the world</HI> (said our Sauiour)
<HI>therefore it is that the world doth hate you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 15. 19.</NOTE> <HI>and speake euill of
you.</HI></P>
<P>As for their priuate surmisings they are of two sorts:
sometime they charge Gods children vvith euill vvhich they
haue done indeede but vvhereof they haue repented them,
<PB N="417" REF="170">
and herein they are malitious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sometime they speake euill of them priuately&punc; and that either maliciously charging them with sins they haue done, but haue repented.</NOTE> that the sinnes vvhich God

let vs not thinke shame to say with the Apostle it is
true, <HI>I was such a one, but now I am receiued to mercy.</HI> I will

healed me.</P>
<P>Sometime againe their surmisings are most false,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or then falsely charging them with sinnes which they neuer did.</NOTE> they
charge vs vvith things vvhich vve neuer did; but these back|bitings
should be disdayned of vs like the barking of beasts:
hee who knowes with <HI>Iob</HI> that his witnesse is in heauen, and

vvithin him, what needes hee to care for the iudgement of
men vvithout him?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. epist. 6. Ital. viduae.</NOTE> <HI>Notitia nostri certior intus est,</HI> the surest

<P>Let not therefore the detracting speaches of men inter|rupt
our peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No speach of man can make vs any other thing then that which we are.</NOTE> remembring their tongues can make vs no

and partly because our weakenesse is easily ouercome
with this tentation. Seeing the Lord will haue vs to sustaine
the strife of tongues, let vs strengthen our selues, let vs so
walke through good report that wee be not puft vp, and
through euill report that we be not cast downe, but that by
weapons of righteousnesse on the right hand and on the left
we may ouercome.</P>
<P>Now as for Sathan he is stiled the accuser of the Saints
of God night and day;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sathan stiled a calumniator or accuser &amp; why.</NOTE> sometime hee accuses God to man;
sometime man to God; and sometime man to himselfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reue. 12. 10</NOTE> In
Paradise hee began and accused God, charging him with
enuie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He accuseth God vnto man</NOTE> and in the same trade of lying doth he still continue:
For sometime he lyes against the iustice of God, when hee
saith to the licentious liuer, albeit yee sinne yee shall not
dye, that so he may puffe him vp to presumption: sometime
he lyes against the mercy of God, as vvhen hee saith to the
vveake in faith, your sinne is greater than that God can for|giue
it, that so he may driue him to desperation: sometime
he lyes against Gods prouidence, as when hee saith to them
that are in necessitie, the Lord hath cast you off and will no
more prouide for you, that so hee may prouoke them to
put out their hand to wickednesse.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hee accuseth man vnto God</NOTE> he is a restlesse accuser of man vnto God, as
yee may see in the example of <HI>Iob:</HI> he heard the Lord com|mending
him yet he spared not to traduce him; when hee
could not gainesay his actions, hee gainsayd his intention
and affection, hee charged him to be a hireling and not a
sonne, a mercenarie worshipper, who serued God for his
gifts and not for himselfe, albeit after tryall he was found
a lyer. And herein we are to consider how faithlesse a tray|tour
Sathan is, for those same sinnes which man doth by
<PB N="419" REF="171">
Sathans instigation, he is the first accuser of man for them
vnto God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A discouery of Sathans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">raite|rous dealing.</NOTE> Oh that man could remember that Sathan is
euer doing one of these three against him: first hee is a
Tempter of man to sinne; secondly when sinne is com|mitted
hee is an accuser of man vnto God for those same
sinnes &punc;which he tempted him to doe: and thirdly, hee is a
tormenter of man for them, vnlesse they be remoued by re|pentance.
But Iesus Christ our Lord is of a plaine contrary
disposition: first hee disswades vs from sinne, warning vs of
the danger, and then if of weakenesse wee sinne, hee offers
himselfe an aduocate for vs if wee repent:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Ioh. 2. 1.</NOTE> <HI>These things my
babes I write to you that yee sinne not, but if any man sinne we
haue an aduocate with the Father, euen Iesus the iust.</HI> These
two compared lets vs see what a great difference there is be|tweene
them, that knowing the deceitfull malice of the di|uell,
we may learne to abhorre him; and the heartie vnfay|ned
affection of Iesus Christ toward vs, wee may loue and
follow him.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hee accuseth man vnto him|selfe.</NOTE> Sathan accuses man vnto himselfe: he deceiues
the vvicked &amp; beares them in hand that they are the sonnes
of God, and labours to perswade the godly that they are re|probates,
denying that they haue Faith or Repentance, or
any spiritual grace. There is nothing so true but Sathan dare
deny it: hee that durst call it in doubt to Christ himselfe
whether he were the sonne of God or no, will that shameles
lyar spare to doe it vnto others?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 2. 12.</NOTE> But let vs <HI>worke out our
saluation in feare and trembling,</HI> and make sure our calling
by well doing, that we may haue within vs the infallible to|kens
of our election, and as for the rest let vs keepe this
ground; seeing the worke of our saluation is done by God,
in despite of Sathan; Sathans testimonie in it is not to be re|garded,
though hee would call vs as he did <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Sylas</HI>
the seruants of the liuing of God, yet are we not the better,
neither the worse, albeit hee pronounce vs to be such as are
abiect and cast away from the fauour of God.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="172">
And last, the children of God are accused of their owne
consciences: these are eyther such as proceede from suffici|ent
light, or from wrong information.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conscience ac|cuseth eyther vpon right or wrong infor|mation.</NOTE> If conscience accuse
vpon light which shee hath receiued out of the word of
God, her sentence is diuine, and wee are to regard it: if o|therwise
shee accuse vpon wrong information, it is the er|rour
of conscience, and wee are to remedie it by sending con|science
to seeke the warrant of her sentence out of the word
of God. It is very expedient that wee put a difference be|tweene
conscience and the errour of conscience:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conscience, &amp; error of consci|ence to be di|stinguished.</NOTE> where con|science
discernes not according to the Law of the supreame
Iudge it cannot but erre, eyther in being ouer large, and
then shee pronounceth those things lawfull which are vn|lawfull,
or ouer strait, and so she declares those things vn|lawfull
which are lawfull: for if this be not obserued, wee
shall be disquieted while we hearken to the errours of con|science,
as if they were the iust and lawfull accusations of
conscience.</P>
<P>Sometime againe conscience presents to men sins which
they haue done many yeeres agoe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Lord leaues remem|brance of a sin in the co~science after that it is pardoned.</NOTE> and whereof they haue
repented: for wee are to know that albeit the Lord after
repentance forgiue the guiltinesse of sinne, yet he will haue
the memorie thereof to remaine in that conseruing facultie
of conscience, called <GAP DESC="foreign">, that it may both serue to
humble vs for the euill wee haue done, as also to preserue
vs from sinne for the time to come. And sinne this manner
of way retained in the memory, I compare it to thornes &amp;
bryers, which in the middest of a garden are hurtfull, and
hinder the grouth of good fruit, but being put in the hedge
are profitable to preserue them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sin euill in the affection but good in the memory.</NOTE> so sinne as long as it is in
the affection is very pernitious; for then it chokes the seede
of the word of God in them, but being taken out of the af|fection
and set in the memory, is as a hedge to the soule, to
preserue it from wilde and raging beasts that would come
in and deuoure it: thus for our humiliation the Lord keepes
in vs a remembrance euen of those sinnes which hee hath
<PB N="421" REF="172">
pardoned, but so that with the remembrance of the euill
which we haue done, our conscience doth also excuse and
comfort vs with the remembrance of our vnfained repen|tance
toward God.</P>
<P>And if otherwise the conscience accuse vs for those euill
deeds which wee haue done, and whereof wee haue not
repented,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 31</NOTE> it is of Gods great mercy toward vs, who by
inward trouble wakens vs to iudge our selues now, that we
should not be iudged of the Lord in the world to come.</P>
<P>As this is the comfort of Gods chosen, so doth it point
vnto vs the contrary miserable estate of the reprobate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As no creature hath place to ac|cuse the godly, so by the con|trary all shall stand vp &amp; ac|cuse the wicked.</NOTE>
for there is nothing in heauen and earth which shall not
stand vp against them to accuse them, the Lord himselfe
shall come neere them as a swift witnesse against them. O
miserable are they to whom the Lord is a Partie, a Iudge,
and a Witnesse:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malach. 3. 5.</NOTE> as our Sauiour said to the Iewes, <HI>Moses</HI> and
all the seruants of God shall be witnesses against them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 5. 45.</NOTE> yea,

witnesse against them: when they are iudged they shall be
condemned, and their owne conscience shall say, righteous is
the Lord and iust are his iudgements.</P>
<P><HI>It is God that Iustifies.</HI> Of this ye may see cleerely, that
Iustification as the Apostle vseth it here, is a iudicial terme,
for he oppones it to accusation and condemnation: but lea|uing
that because wee marked it before, in the poynt of
Iustification, we will adde this more: that the Apostle brings
not the reason of his comfort from his owne innocencie,
but from Gods mercy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The argume~ts of our comfort are not brought from our inno|cency but gods mercy.</NOTE> he saith not, there is nothing in me
worthy to be accused or to be condemned, but his comfort

is, that whateuer it be, God hath pardoned it. This is it that
breedes vnquietnesse and perturbation in many weake con|sciences,
they seeke within themselues that which should
commend them to God, as if they could not be saued vn|lesse
they were perfect; this commeth of Sathans singular
subtiltie, who labours to creep in betweene vs and our war|rant,
as if our owne innocencie were the warrant of our sal|uation,
and not Gods mercy nor Christs merit. It is true, it
becomes vs for our greater comfort to nourish within our
selues the tokens of Grace, but to conclude, that because
they are weake, therefore wee cannot be saued, it is Sathans
sophistrie, with which wee should not suffer our soules to
be abused.</P>

<P>The next is his resurrection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great co~|fort we haue of Christs re|surrection.</NOTE> we haue comfort (saith the

yet in his death his glory was greatly obscured vnder the

any more excuse them, than that deed of the Lord, whereby

honour most,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sitting of Christ at Gods right hand im|ports his high honour and dignitie.</NOTE> as <HI>Salomon</HI> did his mother <HI>Bathsheba:</HI> and
so the phrase will import that high honour and dignitie,
whereunto Christ Iesus as man is exalted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kin. 2. 19.</NOTE> being crowned
with glory both aboue Angels and men.</P>
<P>This right hand of God wherat Christ sits is expounded
by other places of Scripture, to bee the high and hea|uenly
places: which serueth to improue that paralogisme
of the Vbiquitaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Errour of Vbi|quitaries im|proued.</NOTE> who will haue Christs naturall body

God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 1. 20.</NOTE> but so that hee sits in the high, and heauenly places.
The right hand of God, that is, the power and glory of
God stretches throughout the whole world, but wee are
plainly taught that the place of the residence of Christ Iesus
<PB N="425" REF="174">
the man is in the heauenly places, and not in earthly places,
in the high places to which hee is ascended, and not in the
low places in which we soiourne:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 3. 21.</NOTE> <HI>for the heauens must con|tayne
him, vntill the day of refreshment come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And makes request also for vs.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ makes request for vs in heauen.</NOTE> Christ our Lord hath en|tred
into heauen not to enioy for himselfe a blessed life one|ly,
but to appeare in the presence of God for vs. As the high
Priest when he entred into the most holy place, had grauen
in stones vpon his breast the names of the twelue tribes of
Israell: so the Lord Iesus presents to his father the names
of all his elect, that by the merit of his death hee may pro|cure
mercy vnto them.</P>
<P>Here againe wee are taught that Iesus Christ is descry|bed
to vs in holy Scripture as our mediatour of intercession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Mediator of intercession but Iesus Christ.</NOTE>
and that there is no other beside him recommended vnto vs.
In all the old testament no prayer is made to <HI>Henoch, Moses,</HI>
nor <HI>Eliah,</HI> who ended their dayes not after the common
course of men: no prayer to <HI>Abraham,</HI> albeit he was the
Father of the faithfull: yea no prayer to Cherubin nor Se|raphin;
though now the Apostate Church of Rome haue
made as many aduocates for vs in heauen, as there are Saints
departed, and hath framed perticular prayers vnto them,
and which is more ridiculous, hath parted among them the
patrocinie of sundry sorts of sicknesse and diseases.</P>
<P>It is true indeed that the Saints which are departed haue
not as yet all their desires fulfilled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saints depar|ted haue their owne desires which they craue to be ful|filled, but knowes not our necessities.</NOTE> and shall not be perfe|cted
without vs: wherefore also it is that they long for the
full gathering together of the Saints, and for the restitution
of their bodyes, and for the last day of iudgement: but that
they know the perticular troubles of Gods children, our
greatest troubles being inward tentations and wrestlings of
conscience, neither knowne to man nor Angell but onely to
God, who is the searcher of the heart: or that we can in faith
vse them as mediators vnto God for vs, wee iustly deny it.
Where if they take them vnto their common refuge, that
ther is but one mediator of redemption, but many mediators
<PB N="426" REF="175">
of intercession: to this wee answere that in the same place
wherin the Apostle saith <HI>there is one mediator betweene God
and man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 5.</NOTE> the subiect whereof hee entreats is Prayer; so that
euen in prayer he will haue vs to acknowledge no mediator
of intercession but Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>And beside this <HI>Augustine</HI> doth so define a mediator of
intercession, that it can be competent to none but to Iesus
Christ.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Mediator of intercession as he is defined by Augustine is competent to none but christ. <HI>Aug. con. epis Par. l. 2. c.</HI> 8.</NOTE> It is commanded sayth he that euery Christian pray
to God for another: <HI>Pro quo autem nullus interpellat, sed ipse
pro omnibus, hic vnus verus&abque; mediator est,</HI> but he who requests
for all, and for whom none requests is the onely one true
Mediator.</P>
<P>And where againe they alledge that the Saints of God in
heauen are not ignorant of things done vpon earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three manner of wayes are things knowne 1 by sense: 2 by report of creatures: 3 by reuelation from God.</NOTE> we are to
know that things are knowne three manner of wayes: first
by hearing and seeing: Secondly, by reflex, as by looking
in a glasse those things are made knowne to vs which are
behind our backes: and thirdly by report. This second and
third way say they, there is no doubt but Saints that are in
heauen know those things which are done vpon earth, but
both of these are false, for if they say they know our estate
by report of Angels, or such as are departed this life, how
can that be? seeing wee know that when <HI>Hanna</HI> prayed in
the presence of <HI>Eli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">None of these waies do saints departed know our miseries.</NOTE> yet hee knew not her trouble, yea those
who liue in one familie are not priuie to the tentations of o|thers,
that which they knew not in their life, how shalt thou
make them to know it when they are dead?</P>
<P>If againe they say that they haue it by reuelation from
God, then I pray you consider how that one errour of Pa|pistrie
dashes against an other, for sometime in the same
controuersie they say, that as in earthly courts we must first
communicate our petitions to those who must be our me|diators
to the King: now if it be so that they haue no in|telligence
of our estate but such as they receiue from God,
wherefore shall wee pray to them to commend our cause
vnto God who knowes it better than they, &amp; pities it more
<PB N="417" REF="175">
than they: as <HI>Augustine</HI> prettily obserues out of that Pa|rable

<Q>Who shall seperate vs from the loue of Christ?

<P>_WEe haue heard the Apostles perticular triumph
against sinne: now followes his perticular tri|umph
against the Crosse:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His perticular triumph a|gainst the crosse: no crosse can cut vs off from the loue of God.</NOTE> he glories not in this
that Christians are without a Crosse, yea rather
he shewes it is the lot of Gods children to be
exercised with all sorts of crosses; but herein hee reioyces,
that no crosse can seperate vs from the loue of God. In this
quarrell the Apostle prouokes all enimies whatsoeuer, cor|porall
or spirituall, present or to come; and against them all
he takes vp the triumph in his owne name, and in the name
of all the children of God: <HI>Neuerthelesse in all these things
we are more then conquerours through him that loued vs.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse. 37.</NOTE></P>
<P>By the loue of Christ we are to vnderstand here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our loue to God cannot fully nor final|ly be put out by any trouble, nor yet the sense of his loue to vs.</NOTE> that loue
wherwith God in Christ hath loued vs, for so he expounds
it himselfe, <HI>through him that loued vs.</HI> It is true also that the
sense of our loue to God once shed abroad in our harts by
the holy ghost, can neuer fully nor finally be taken from vs;
I say fully and finally because of those inward tentations
wherewith Gods children are so exercised, that the sense of
that loue in them is greatly diminished: but in all those spi|rituall
desertions &amp; oppressions Faith ouercomes at length,
and lets vs see the face of God our mercifull father shining
toward vs in Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4. 9.</NOTE> we may be cast downe but we cannot
perish; if <HI>Peter</HI> be ready to sincke Iesus Christ shall suc|cour
him.</P>
<P>But as I said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But here the Apostle vnder|stands the loue of God to vs which can ne|uer be altred.</NOTE> by the Loue of God I vnderstand that loue
which hee hath borne toward vs: from this most constant
loue it comes to passe, that wee who are weake and silly
creatures cannot be ouercome, notwithstanding the multi|tude
of mightie enimies that are against vs. If our saluation
were in our owne custodie, and wee stoode by our owne

strength, the smallest tentation would ouercome vs; our feet
are ready to slide, and then our feeble hands lets goe that
hold of mercy, which once wee had gotten; but howsoeuer
we loose our hold, the Lord holds it fast for vs: wee may
change, but hee remaines the same; because the Lord hath
loued vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 13. 1.</NOTE> and whom once he loueth, he loueth to the ende:
therefore is it that it cannot be but well with vs; hee loued
vs before wee were, yea, before the world was made. If we
search the beginning of Gods Loue towards vs, wee may
runne vp in our thought to the beginning of the world, but
cannot attaine to the beginning of this Loue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 90. 2.</NOTE> <HI>before the
mountaines were made, and thou hadst formed the world, euen
from euerlasting to euerlasting thou art our God.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise we are taught here that the end vvhich Sathan
proposeth to himselfe in all tentations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of all Sathans tenta|tions is to sepe|rate vs from the loue of God.</NOTE> is to seperate vs from
the loue of God, vvhich notwithstanding he shall neuer ef|fectuate.
There is a couenant knit vp betweene God and
man, the band whereof is Iesus Christ, this Couenant Sa|than
doth what he can to dissolue it, by alluring vs to sinne,
and accusing vs to God: on Gods part he cannot preuaile,
on our part he assaults continually, but in vaine also, because
the Lord vvho hath made a couenant with vs, keepes vs also
vvith him, so that though vvee be tempted vve cannot be
ouercome. This is euident in <HI>Iobs</HI> tentations, it was neyther
the affliction of his body, the losse of his children, nor goods
which Sathan craued so much as to empty his heart of the
loue of God&punc; and make him to blaspheme.</P>
<P>If vve remembred this it vvould make vs endeauour to
possesse our soules in patience in all our troubles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If we remem|bred this, it would make vs strong in all tentations.</NOTE> for so oft
as those things vvhich vve loue are seperate from vs, Sa|thans
end is to seperate vs from our God, vvhom vve should
loue aboue all things. And in very deed this is a proper mark
of the Children of God, that hovveuer their outvvard estate
change, their heart is neuer changed from the loue of God;
they are Godly in prosperitie, but more Godly in aduersitie,
the more they are troubled the neerer they draw vnto the
<PB N="430" REF="177">
Lord: as fire in not quenched with wind but made greater,
so the loue of God waxeth stronger in the hearts of Gods
children by tribulation; whereas the wicked not rooted in
Iesus Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 1. 4.</NOTE> are like vnto chaffe and the dust of the earth,
carryed away with euery winde; there is no pleasure so
small, nor profite so vaine which they preferre not before
God.</P>
<P>Now before the Apostle subioynes the answere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christians are subiect to many crosses.</NOTE> he ma|keth
an enumeration of some perticular crosses, and de|maunds
if they will doe it: these crosses do eyther concerne
our bodies, our goods, our dwellings, or our mindes; for we
are not to thinke here that the Apostle beates the ayre, tri|umphing
against such enimies as we haue not. No, we haue
both crosses of body and of minde, which wee must pre|pare
our selues to suffer; so vsing all the helpes of this our
mortall life, as being content for the loue of God to want
them, for this is the tryall of true religion, we must not looke
to our houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our dwelling on earth is not the place of our rest, as the Iews thought; farre lesse the place of our glory as Nabuchadne|zer thought.</NOTE> as <HI>Nabuchadnezer</HI> did to his pallace of Babell,
as a place of his glory, but remember that which <HI>Micah</HI>
said to the Iewes, <HI>This is not the place of your rest:</HI> and what|soeuer
thing else wee vse for maintenance of this mortall
life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Micah. 2. 10</NOTE> let vs so vse them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 7. 31.</NOTE> as if we vsed them not, that wee be
not found when it comes to the tryall louers of them more
then louers of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. 3. 4.</NOTE> Blessed is the man who loues nothing
otherwise but in God, <HI>Nam solus is nihil charum amittit, cui
omnia chara sunt in eo qui non amittitur.</HI></P>
<P>Againe perceiue here in this enumeration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods indul|gence toward vs appeares in that he hath not laid on vs the greatest crosses.</NOTE> a gradation of
seauen steppes, by which the Apostle ascends: It is a great
thing to be in trouble, but to be troubled, and in anguish
also is yet greater, and for him that is in anguish to be bani|shed,
in banishment to sustaine hunger and nakednesse, and
with these to be in continuall perill, and last of all to dye by
the sword, euery one of these last is greater then the for|mer,
yet all of them (saith the Apostle) are not able to se|perate
vs from the loue of Christ. Our warning is here that
when we see vnto how many crosses Christians are subiect,
<PB N="431" REF="177">
and how few of them God hath laid vpon vs, wee should
acknowledge the Lords fatherly indulgence toward vs, who
regarding our weakenesse hath hitherto dealt tenderly with
vs. And againe it should prepare vs for greater afflictions,
so long as wee haue not resisted to the bloud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 4.</NOTE> nor laide
downe our liues for Iesus, we should remember that greater
battailes than any which as yet we haue foughten are before
vs, wherein we must fight, if it please the Lord to enter vs
into them.</P>
<P><HI>Shall tribulation?</HI> Now hee commeth to the perticular
enumeration. The first is tribulation: the vvord <GAP DESC="foreign">,
vvhich the Apostle vseth signifieth a pressing out, from the
effect vvhich it vvorketh in the godly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The afflictions of the Godly and wicked dif|fer in nature.</NOTE> to vvit, that it pres|seth
out and maketh manifest that grace of God which be|fore
vvas latent in them, like as in the vvicked it presseth out
their vile and filthy corruption, which before vvas secret:
for the afflictions of the godly and of the vvicked differs in
nature and in effects: the vvicked in suffering communica|teth
vvith the curse of <HI>Adam, cursed is the earth for thy sake,
in sorrow shalt thou eate of it all the dayes of thy life:</HI> but the
Godly in their suffering communicates with the Crosse of
Christ.<NOTE PLACE="marg">For the one in suffering com|municates with the curse of A|dam, the other with the crosse of Christ.</NOTE></P>
<P>They differ also in effects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They differ al|so in effects: for trouble makes the one to blesse, the o|ther to blas|pheme.</NOTE> for the godly man being pres|sed
by trouble, brings out the fruite of praise and thanks|giuing
vvith patience: <HI>Sicut aromata odorem, non nisi cum
accenduntur expandunt,</HI> As sweet spices spreads not abroad
their smell, till they be burnt or beaten; or as a graine of
mustard seede not stamped seemes to be soft, vvhere other|wise
being brayed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Moral. in Iob. lib. 2.</NOTE> it renders out a strong sauour: so the
children of God who otherwise seeme to be weake and void
of spirituall strength, when they are beaten by affliction,
sends out a sweete smelling sauour of rich and manifold
graces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affliction is Gods wine-presse.</NOTE> And therefore I call affliction the wine-presse of
God the great Husband-man, by which hee so presses the
berryes of the fruitfull trees of his owne vine-yard, that
out of their iuyce hee may glorifie himselfe and comfort
<PB N="432" REF="178">
others, but the wicked are like vnto a vile stinking puddle,
which the more it is stirred the worse it smelleth: for when
they are troubled they send out blasphemie, rayling, mur|muring,
and in their impatiencie foome out their owne
shame.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> The second is <HI>Anguish.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The godly are not onely trou|bled but oft|times straited in trouble.</NOTE> The word he vseth is <GAP DESC="foreign">,
which properly signifieth straitnesse of place, wherein a
man is so pinched, that hee is not able to turne him. Now
from the body it is translated to the minde, to expresse the
straitnesse of the afflictions of the children of God, out of
which ofttimes they the~selues can see no passage: that which
<HI>Dauid</HI> said to <HI>Ionathan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 20. 3</NOTE> <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Lord liueth there is but one
steppe betweene me and death,</HI> so fareth it many a time with
the Children of God, but the Lord commeth in with vn|looked
for deliuerance in their most desperate distresse,
which not onely relieueth them for the present, but doth
confirme them for the time to come.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 1. 9. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Wee receiued</HI> (saith
the Apostle) <HI>the sentence of death in our selues, because wee
should not trust in our selues, but in God who raiseth the dead,
who deliuered vs from so great a death, and doth deliuer vs, in
whom we trust that he will yet deliuer vs.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> The third is <HI>Persecution.</HI> The word <GAP DESC="foreign">, signifieth
that sort of affliction, by which the Children of God are
persecuted and chased from one place to another:<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are per|secuted &amp; cha|sed from place to place.</NOTE> the
world hath neuer thought them worthy of a roome among
them, and therefore haue they beene forced to liue in caues,
and dennes, and wildernesses: but our comfort is, that the
Lord hath alwayes shewed himselfe most familiar with his
Children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God most fa|miliar with his children, when they are bani|shed by men.</NOTE> when the world hath been most hard vnto them,
<HI>Iacob</HI> is banished from his fathers house by the crueltie of
<HI>Esau,</HI> and his heauenly Father receiued him into his house,
comforting him by such a familiar reuelation of his pre|sence,
as hee neuer had felt before so long as hee dwelt at
home: and <HI>Iohn</HI> being banished by <HI>Domitian</HI> into Path|mos,
found also the Lord reueiling himselfe vnto him more
familiarly than he had done before. What part of the world
<PB N="433" REF="178">
is there, wherein Tyrants can banish the Children of God
from the acts of their Comforter? they know that in their
owne house they are strangers, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was in Cana|an
the Land of his inheritance, and therefore can be the
better content as strangers to liue in any other part of the
world. <HI>Basil</HI> being threatned by <HI>Modestus</HI> the Deputie of
the Emperour with banishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazian de vita Basil.</NOTE> <HI>Nihil (inquit) horum quae

aspicimus naturae exilium,</HI> possessing nothing I am free
from the feare of banishment, knowing that Paradise is the
onely country of men, and the whole earth is a common
place of banishment to vs all.</P>
<P>The fourth is <HI>Famine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Famine is one of Gods ordi|narie plagues, and with it also the godly are tryed.</NOTE> which of it own nature is one of the <MILESTONE N="4">
plagues of God, but lesse than his other ordinary plagues of
the sword, &amp; pestilence: therfore the Lord who best knows
the waight of his owne rods, accounts three dayes of pesti|lence,
three moneths of the sword, and three yeeres of fa|mine
equiualent. Many wayes hath the Lord by which hee
bringeth famine vpon a people: for sometime he maketh
the Heauen aboue as brasse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 26. 19</NOTE> and the earth beneath as yron,
so that albeit men labour and sow, yet they receiue no en|crease;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deu. 11. 14.</NOTE>
sometime againe he giues in dew season the first and
latter raine, so that the earth renders abundance, but the
Lord by blasting-winds, or by the Caterpiller, Canker|worme,
and Grasse-hopper doth consume them, who com|meth
out as exacters and officers sent from God to poind
men in their goods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miserable are they whose gaine is to en|crease Famine, they are Cater|pillers in the Land.</NOTE> because with them they would not ho|nour
the Lord: which I marke by the way, that those vn|naturall
men who doe what they can to encrease famine in
the Land, may know they are but Caterpillers, scourges, and
roddes of the wrath of God, or as <HI>Basil</HI> calleth them <HI>Mer|catores
humanarum calumnitatum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil. ser. 1. in Auar.</NOTE> making their priuate gain
a common calamitie, and vsing that as a benefite to them|selues,
which God hath threatned as a plague to the people:
<PB N="434" REF="179">
assuredly vnlesse they repent the Lord shall cast them at
length into the fire, as the roddes of his wrath.</P>
<P>But we are to know that famine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lord who changed the Serpent into a flourishing rod hath changed cursed famine into a blessed crosse to his children.</NOTE> which in the owne na|ture
is a curse and plague of God, to the godly is changed:
the Lord who made the bitter waters of <HI>Marah</HI> sweet, and
turned a biting serpent into a florishing rod, hath changed
the nature of all those euils which sinne hath brought vpon
vs, now they worke for our good, and are become like
Waspes wanting stings, profitable to waken vs and exercise
our faith, but not able to seperate vs from the loue of God.
Among those famine is a great tentation, Nature being im|patient
of the want of necessaries; and therefore Sathan who
picks out the time and place of tentations as may be most
for his vantage, tempted our blessed Sauiour when hee be|gan
to waxe hungry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 4. 3.</NOTE> It is a rare grace in want to praise the
Lord and trust in his fatherly prouidence. <HI>Salomon</HI> neuer
felt it, yet hee knew it was a rare tentation, therefore hee
praied that the Lord would neither giue him pouertie nor
riches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 30. 8.</NOTE> least the one make him full, and cause him deny God,
and the other should cause him to steale, and take the name
of God in vaine: yet no extremitie of this tentation can se|perate
them from the loue of God, for either in their grea|test
necessities the Lord meruailously prouides for them, or
then strengthens them with patience and inward comfort to
sustaine it.</P>
<P>For sometime the earth hath beene as iron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Lord prouides in fa|mine for his children.</NOTE> but the hea|uens
hath ministred food to Gods people; as in that barren
wildernesse wherein Israell soiourned, the earth yeelded no
fruit, but the heauens rayned downe Manna and Quailes:
and sometime the heauens haue beene as brasse, yet in the
earth hath the Lord prouided nourishment, as he did by the
Rauens and the Widdow of Sarepta for <HI>Eliah:</HI> and if other|wise
it please the Lord by famine to inflict death vpon his
children, then he strengthens their spirits with the bread of
life, and comforts their hearts with hid <HI>Manna,</HI> so that they
can say to worldlings as our Sauiour said to his Disciples,
<PB N="435" REF="179">
<HI>I haue bread to eate that yee know not of:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 4. 32.</NOTE> and so no famine
can seperate them from the loue of God.</P>
<P><HI>Nakednesse.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christians try|ed also with Nakednesse.</NOTE> This is also a great tentation, partly for the <MILESTONE N="5">
shame, and partly for the decay of naturall life, which fol|lowes
it. Before the Iewes crucified Christ they striped him
naked of his garments. <HI>Basile</HI> makes mention of fortie Mar|tyres
who being striped naked were put foorth in the night
to be pined with cold, and afterward burnt with fire in the
day. Of these it is euident that nakednesse is one of those
tentations whereby Sathan seekes to trouble our faith and
patience: but he who hath put on the Lord Iesus for a gar|ment,
neither shame nor losse of naturall life procured by
nakednesse, can seperate him from the Loue of God.</P>
<P>Where we may perceiue how different the dispositions
of the Christian and the worldling are.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The begged glory of world+lings is in their apparell.</NOTE> The men of this

<HI>As it is written.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant har|monie among the writers of holy Scripture.</NOTE> Albeit the Apostles had their immedi|ate
calling from God, and spake and wrote nothing of pri|uate

to confirme their doctrine by testimonies of the Prophets.
This harmonie among the writers of holy Scripture is no

one truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 1. 11</NOTE> As the Cherubines stretch their wings one to an|other,

of Christs misticall body. The two Testaments are

our saluation. And it is to be marked that out of these bookes

which the primitiue Church of old, &amp; the reformed Church

<P><HI>For thy sake.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things obseruedin this testimonie.</NOTE> In the testimonie wee haue three things:

<HI>All the day long,</HI> that is, not in one age, but in all

their suffering, <HI>for thy sake.</HI></P>
<P>It is necessary for our comfort that wee marke the foun|taine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The causes for which God sends affliction should bee marked.</NOTE>
and from whence affliction proceedes to the Godly,
for the ignorance thereof makes many to erre with the
friends of <HI>Iob,</HI> and iudge wrong of the godly, as if they were
stricken alway for their sinnes, when indeed they are not:
wee are therefore to know that sometime affliction comes
to the Godly for sinne past; sometime for sinne to come;
sometime neyther for sinne past, nor sinne to come, but that
the workes of God may be made manifest.</P>
<P>The first way afflictions to them whom the Lord lo|ueth
are medicinall restoratiues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Afflictions laid on for sin past are medicinall restoratiues.</NOTE> by which they are wake|ned
to recouer their health by repentance for those sinnes
through which they haue become spiritually diseased: for
howsoeuer the Lord giue loose reines to the children of
wrath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 81. 12.</NOTE> and deliuers them vp to their owne hearts desire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 2. 6.</NOTE> yet
will he hedge in with thrones the wayes of those whom he
<PB N="441" REF="182">
purposeth to saue, and will waken them by some sharp rod
or other, when he feeth them sleeping in securitie; so taught
hee <HI>Miriam</HI> by Lepros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e to leaue her murmuring; so wake|ned
hee <HI>Ionas</HI> out of his sleepe by casting him into the sea;
he cured <HI>Zachary</HI> of infidelitie by striking him with dumb|nesse;
hee diuerted <HI>Paul</HI> from his euill course by blindnes:
blessed is the man whom the Lord this way correcteth.</P>
<P>Sometime againe the Lord sends affliction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Afflictions laid on to preuent sin to come are wholesome preseruatiues.</NOTE> as preserua|tiues
to his children to keepe them from sinne, whereunto
hee seeth of their weaknesse they are ready to fall, if they

buffet <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 12. 7.</NOTE> not for any sinne he had done, but for a sinne
that he might doe, least he should haue beene exalted out

<P>And sometime the Lord layeth on affliction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But euery affli|ction is not laid on the godly for sinne</NOTE> neyther to
correct sinnes past, nor to preuent sinnes to come, but that
the workes of God may be made manifest, which our Sa|uiour

him that was borne blind, whether it was for his owne
sinnes, or the sinnes of his Parents: aunswered it was for
neyther of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 9. 3.</NOTE> but <HI>that the workes of God might be made

affliction are of two sorts; for not onely his meruailous
power and constant truth in preseruing and deliuering his
owne Church in all troubles against the power, falshoode,
and malice of the world, are manifested that all men may
see, it is not by the arme of man, but by the power of God
that his Church is continued vpon earth: but likewise these
manifold graces of God, wrought secretly by his holy Spi|rit
in the hearts of his children, are made manifest to the
world, such as their constant faith; their inuincible loue to|ward
God; their patience in the hardest sort of crosses. And
vnto these kindes of afflictions doe wee referre that which
here is spoken.</P>
<P>These afflictions which are for Gods sake, require these
two things, comprised by the Apostle in these words, <HI>Faith
<PB N="442" REF="183">
and a good Conscience,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1. 19</NOTE> that is a good Religion and a good

euill, though thou wouldest giue thy body to be burnt for
Religion, yet shall not thy suffering be suffering for Chists
cause:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Let none of you suffer as euill doers, but if any man suffer
as a Christian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyprian de duplici mart.</NOTE> <HI>let him not be ashamed. Non suppliciu~ facit mar|tyrem

the cause.</P>
<P>There hath beene no Heresie so grosse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Gods Martirs may be knowne from Sathans Mar|tyrs.</NOTE> but some men
haue beene bold to dye for it: which is not Christian forti|tude,
but miserable hardnesse of heart. As the Lord Iesus

wee will conclude with <HI>Augustine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. l. 1. con. Parmen. Epi. cap. 8. &amp; 9.</NOTE> <HI>Non est ex passione
certa Iustitia,</HI> it is not suffering that makes sure a cause to
be righteous: <HI>Sed ex Iustitia gloriosa passio,</HI> but it is righte|ousnesse
which makes suffering glorious.</P>
<P><HI>For thy sake.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It is common to al Christians to suffer with Christ, not so to suffer for him.</NOTE> It is common to all the Godly to suffer with
Christ as yee heard before: but to suffer for Christ is not a
honour communicated to them all; the rarer that it is, the
more heartely should wee welcome it when God sends it.
The Apostle reioyced in the bonds wherewith hee was
bound for Christs cause: the golden chaines of earthly am|bassadours
are nothing so honourable as chaines of yron
which are worne for Christs cause. The Emperour <HI>Con|stantine</HI>
honoured all the Fathers of the Counsell of Nice,
but made most of those who had suffered for the cause of
Christ; as in perticular, hee kissed the hole of <HI>Paphnutius</HI>
eye, which had beene put out in time of trouble for Christs
sake, yet did hee reuerence it as the most honourable and
precious part of his body: no face so beautifull as that which
is deformed; no man so rich as hee who hath sustained spo|liation
of his goods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 34.</NOTE> if it be for Christs sake, neyther is any
<PB N="443" REF="183">
death so glorious, as that which is sustained for his cause:

pro Domino,</HI> for if they be blessed which dye in the Lord,
much more blessed are they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o dye for the Lord.</P>
<P>But now because no Christian is persecuted without some
cause alleadged against him by his persecuters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How causes falsely preten|ded by the wic|ked takes not from the chri|stian this com|fort that he suf|fers for Gods sake.</NOTE> and that also
in euery trouble his owne conscience saith that hee hath
most iustly deserued it; how can hee haue this comfort that
he suffers for Christs sake? The first is easily answered if we
put a difference betweene the pretended and the true cause
for which the wicked doe persecute vs. If <HI>Haman</HI> beare
malice to <HI>Mordecay,</HI> for his sake hee will forge a crime a|gainst
all the people of the Iewes: if <HI>Amazia</HI> can couer his
hatred against <HI>Amos</HI> by pretending that <HI>Amos</HI> hath con|spired
against the King: If the Princes of <HI>Darius</HI> enuy <HI>Da|niels</HI>
preferment, they can delate him as a rebell to the kings
proclamation: If <HI>Ieremie</HI> exhort the Iewes to goe out to
the King of Babell, hee shall be accused as a confederate
with the Chaldean. It is a common stratagem of Sathans to
staine the glory of Gods Children in their sufferings with
false pretended crimes, <HI>Vt qui conscientiae suae luce clarescunt,
f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lsis rumoribus sordidentur,</HI> that they who are cleared by the

hee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> who hath a good conscience ought not to be moued

said they were slaine? To this I answere, that two manner
of wayes are the godly pertakers of Christs afflictions, euen
when they are not troubled in their owne persons: first by
lympathie with others that are troubled; for as the head of

of the rest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 15</NOTE> If we mourne with them that mournes, and re|member

his seruants to trouble before others. For the Lord is not so
prodigall of the liues of his children, that at one time hee
will hauock them all in the hands of the wicked: though
he send some out to the tryall, he will reserue others to be

by men to the christians, and therefore they were persecuted
to death, with no lesse opinion than that the putting them
out of the way was to put the plagues of God from the

<P>_THe Apostle continuing in his triumph, mounts

<P>Of the which wee haue first to learne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Christian may be assured of his saluation in this life, con|trary to the do|ctrine of papists</NOTE> that a Christian
man in this life may be perswaded of his saluation, neyther
is it to be accounted presumption, for as much as in so do|ing
hee leanes not vpon himselfe, but vpon the word and
promise of God, which the Lord hath confirmed by an
oath, that hee may make sure to the heyres of promise the
stabilitie of his counsell. Where if the aduersary obiect, that
the word of the Lord out of all doubt is true, and that they
who beleeues and repents shall be saued, but euery one who
saith hee beleeues doth not beleeue, and so cannot be per|swaded
of his saluation? To this I answere, that hee who
repents vnfainedly and beleeues, knowes as certainely that
hee hath repentance and faith, as hee who hath in his hand
a iewell knowes that he hath i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">; and therefore may conclude
with himselfe that the promises of saluation made to the pe|nitent
beleeuers belongs vnto him: for albeit it be true, there
be many in the Church like vnto those fiue foolish Virgins,
who suppose they haue that which they shall not be found
to haue in the end, yet is there no reason to conclude that be|cause
some are deceiued, all are deceiued; because some
thinke they haue faith and haue it not, therefore none can
be sure that they haue faith.</P>
<P>Out of all doubt where the Lord Iesus dwelleth by his

which hee workes in them to whom hee is giuen:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 13. 5.</NOTE> eyther
therfore must the aduersary say, that there are none to whom
the Spirit is giuen, or they must graunt that they to whom
he is giuen are sure: the first they will not affirme, the se|cond
they cannot with reason deny:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 16.</NOTE> for what is this to say
that a man hath the Seale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 1. 22.</NOTE> the Witnesse, and the Earnest

these doe not make him who hath them sure of saluation?</P>
<P>But here least that which I haue said discourage them
who are of weake consciences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort for the godly whe~ they cannot finde this assu|rance.</NOTE> let them know that this assu|rance

<P>But as for that Religion which teacheth doubtings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A good religi|on may haue doubting, but it is an euill re|ligion which leaues men in doubt.</NOTE> and
pronounceth them accursed who hold that a man may be

two things which discouers vnto vs the vani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e of worldly

<PB N="452" REF="188">
who wanted nothing delectable vnder the Sunne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 2. 10.</NOTE> yet by
the very vse of them, he found the vanitie of them, and was
moued to abhorre them. It is far otherwise with heauenly
pleasures, the more we tast of them, the more wee esteeme
of them, hungring still for more, we cannot be satisfied with
that which wee haue gotten already.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If they be con|tinuall they be|come painfull.</NOTE> worldly pleasures are of this nature, that if
they be continued without intermission they turn into pains;
therefore is it that those same things which now we choose
for recreation, incontinently they become wearisome vnto
vs, and wee cast them away, so that it is not so much by
themselues, as by the change of them that we are delighted,
<HI>Sola vicessitudine recreamur:</HI> being weary of walking, we re|fresh
our selues with sitting; againe being vveary of fitting,
we rise to refresh our selues with walking, and so fareth it
with all the recreations of this life, being continuall they be|come
wearisome. So oft therefore as Sathan by worldly
pleasures would steale away our hearts from the loue of
God, let vs consider how vaine and small a pleasure it is
vvhich he would giue vs, in respect of that vnspeakeable ioy
which he would take from vs.</P>
<P><HI>Nor death.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remembrance of death profi|table to keepe vs vncorrupted with the plea|sures of this life</NOTE> By death vvee vnderstand not onely death it

hath beene concluded by death: no life so pleasant but the
paines of death shall swallow vp all the pleasures therof. As
the seauen leane Kine deuoured the seauen fat, &amp; the seauen
yeares of famine consumed the fruit of seauen yeares of
plenty: so shall the dolours and terrours of death eate vp
all the pleasures and delectations of this vvretched life. If
vve suffer the pleasures of this life to bewitch vs, be sure the
terrours of death shall confound vs. It were therefore good
that as <HI>Ioseph</HI> of Aramathia had his sepulcher in his Gar|den,

<P><PB N="453" REF="188">
Yet our comfort is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comfort for the godly a|gainst death.</NOTE> that if wee liue in Christ, no terror
of death can seperate vs from him; yea, death conioynes vs
neerer to the Lord Iesus then wee were before: wee see oft|times
by experience that the children of God haue so tri|umphed

sense of Gods loue, that they haue forgot all their bodily
paines. As the top of mount Pisgah,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 34. 1.</NOTE> was to <HI>Moses</HI> the place
of his death, and the first place, wherein euer hee got a sight

the Father hath committed vs, that hee might redeeme and
saue vs; hee hath taken vs into his hand and none are able to

how that there are two chaines wherewith they are bound,

euils is hee able to doe by naturall meanes, which the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ui|dence

chaines which are vpon him, are an euill conscience, and
the wrath of God: for as he growes in euill doing so grow|eth
his conscience worse and worse, and the wrath of God
accordingly encreaseth vpon him, with which two he is con|tinually
tormented.</P>
