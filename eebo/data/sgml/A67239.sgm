<P>_IN all the dealings of God with the sons of
men, when judgement and righteousnes is not
executed between man and man, God then
brings one punishment or other upon the
Land, that makes inquisition for blood that hath been
spilt, wrongs that hath been done, wickednesse that hath
been acted by unrighteous men.</P>
<P>But yet the end of Gods dealing thus with his crea|tures
is love, as in <HI>Ier.</HI> 30. 17, 18. a restoring of health,
an healing of wounds: though <HI>Ephraim</HI> is smitten, yet
<HI>Ephraim</HI> is loved, he is a dear son, a tender childe, there is
health in the latter end.</P>
<P>Whosoever looks upon these times outwardly, may
see a poore distressed Kingdom, groaning under the hea|vie
burdens, that lye upon it: and whosoever looks be|yond
the outward state of the Kingdome, may see love,
peace, and joy, spread into the hearts of creatures, disco|vered
in severall (yet) glorious administrations.</P>
<P>The occasion of bondages, troubles, that hath been, and
yet is, in this Nation, makes the members of this Nation
to enquire for Freedome, to search and sift out the root,
and foundations of bondages, of all sorts, some after this
manner, some after that, as hath been evidently seen, in
the Petitions of many well affected people of <HI>England,</HI>
which have been presented to the Parliament at sundrie
times.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
Among the rest, I my self desired to know the foun|dation
of some bondages, that have inslaved the Nation
for almost this six hundred yeers; and by Providence I
found some recorded in Records, which I now commend
to the consideration of all honest hearted people, lest any
should say, I speak against the persons of men: I desire
them to understand, that I speak against the practise of
men which is destructive to the wel being of the Nation,
be they Nation or person whatsoever, it matters not to
me, for honesty in a Turk, or Jew, Heathen, or Pagan, is
as good, as honesty in those that are called Christians: I
could wish, that the nature of Christianity was more
looked upon, and the name of Christianity lesse looked
upon; for it is the cunning sleight of the Man of sin to
make people think themselves happy, as having the name
of Christians, without looking any further unto the na|ture
of Christianitie: I am not ignorant how people have
been looked upon as bearing the name of <HI>Sectaries,</HI> or
<HI>Independants,</HI> and so for <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> or <HI>Episcopall,</HI> the
envy of the name in one anothers hearts, hath bred abun|dance
of heart-burnings one toward another; My advice
therefore is to all, to let names fall, let honesty and god|linesse
be imbraced in any man; and let oppression, Arbi|trary
power, and cruelty be looked upon in any, as de|structive
to the well being of the Nation: if we do so, we
shall look upon things as being acted in the center of
them, and so esteemed. I leave this following Discourse,

<HEAD>Not the respecting of persons who|soever,
but in love to my Countrey, for Liberty,
and Freedome; and a hating of Tyranny, Arbitrary
Power, and Cruelty: I begin this ensuing Discourse.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the making of way to this ensuing Discourse it
is requisite to shew; for satisfaction to them that
shall read this Discourse, the party, by whom the
bondages of this Land came in, not in any way of
disgrace to his person, but rather to discover the
acts that he did, which rose from his oppressing minde and will.
And first of the Person.</P>
<P>In the lives of the three Norman Kings of <HI>England,</HI> in pag. 1.
there is a relation of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerers birth, which is ex|pressed
in these words.</P>
<P><HI>Robert</HI> Duke of Normandy, the sixth in discent from <HI>Rollo,</HI>
riding through <HI>Fallis</HI> a Town in <HI>Normandy,</HI> espied certain Dam|sels
dancing near the way, among whom he fixed his eye upon
a certain Damsell, whose name was <HI>Arlote,</HI> of mean parentage,
a Skiners daughter, whom he procured that night to be brought
unto him, of whom he begat a Son, who afterward was named
<HI>William:</HI> By this relation it appears, that <HI>Will:</HI> the Conquerer
was base son of <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of Normandy, as may more fully
appear, in the Summary of English Chronicles, in pag. 37. <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
Duke of Normandy, surnamed <HI>Conquerer,</HI> base Son of <HI>Ro|bert</HI>
the sixth, Duke of that Dutchie. But lest any should think,
that I make this discoverie on purpose to disgrace the <HI>Conquerer,</HI>
I say I do not, for I say no more then what Chronicles do testi|fie
of him.</P>
<P>Secondly, a bastard sometime hath been an Instrument of
deliverance to the people of God, as <HI>Iephthah, Iudg. 11. 29. The
Spirit of the Lord came upon Iephthah,</HI> ver. 32. the Lord delivered
his Enemies into his hand: so that God made use of <HI>Iephthah</HI> to
work deliverance.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
Thirdly, a bastard is not to be blamed, as being a bastard,
for it is the parents, not the childe that must be blamed, or sha|med.
I shall say no more, touching <HI>William</HI> the Conquerers
birth, and reasons, why I do think that <HI>Williams</HI> person is not
to be despis<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">d of any, as being a base son to <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of
Normandy: but proceed further to shew by what means he
came to be crowned King of <HI>England:</HI> In the Summary of English
Chronicles, in pag. 37. declares unto us, that <HI>William</HI> the Con|querer
came to be crowned King of <HI>England,</HI> by Conquest in
these words.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> Duke of Normandy, surnamed <HI>Conquerer,</HI> base Son
to <HI>Robert,</HI> the sixth, Duke of that Dutchie, and Nephew unto
King <HI>Edward,</HI> began his Reign over this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> the
14th of October, in the yeer of our Lord, 1066. after the battell
at Hastings, Duke <HI>William</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> where with great joy
he was received, both of the Clergy and people; and was pro|claimed
King, and crowned on Christmas day, by <HI>Aldred</HI> Arch|bishop
of York.</P>
<P>It must be agreed on by all parties, that God gives the King|doms
of the Earth to whomsoever he will: <HI>Dan.</HI> 4. 32. 35. So God
gave all Kingdoms of the Earth unto <HI>Nebuchadnezzar;</HI> but if
<HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> tyrannise over the people, then great Kings
should serve themselves of him: <HI>Ier:</HI> 25. 13, 14. And so though
<HI>Assiria</HI> did reign, yet it must be brought lowe: Even so though
God did give this land into the hand of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer,
yet he setting up of such Laws as tend to the destruction of the
poore, it is just with God to take the Government out of the
hands of his posterity, who uphold, and maintain those Laws
that were made to inslave the Commoners of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Before I come to declare the bondages of this Nation, that
was brought upon them by <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer, I shall speak
of some remarkable things of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, King of
<HI>England</HI> before the Conquest; as I find recorded in the Acts and
Monuments of the Church, in pag. 165.</P>
<P>They that write the History of St. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor,
make mention of a dream, (or revelation) that should be shewed
unto him in the time of his sicknes: How that because the Peers
and Bishops of the Land were not the servants of God, but of
<PB N="3" REF="4">
the devill, God would give this Land into the hand of others,
and the King desired that utterance might be given him, that
he might declare it to the people, whereby they might repent:
here note if true, as for my part I cannot gainsay it, see the
mercy of God toward this Land, as to forewarn them of the
danger that should come upon them; which not long after this
Kings death did come to passe, when <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer
overcame this Land.</P>
<P>This <HI>Edward</HI> in that dark age, made such good and whol|some
Laws, which were so just, so equall, and so serving the pub|lick
profit, and weal of all estates, that mine Authors say, that
people did long rebell against their Heads, (and Rulers) to
have the same Laws again, being taken from them, could not
obtain them.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> the Conquerer, at his coming in, did swear to use
and practise the same good Laws of <HI>Edward,</HI> for the Common
Laws of the Realm; afterward being established in the King|dome,
he forswore himself, and placed his own Laws in their
room, much more worse and obscurer. Also this King <HI>Edward</HI>
describeth the office of a King, in the Acts and Monuments of
the Church, in pa. 166. The King, because he is the Vicar of the
highest King, is appointed for this purpose, to rule the Earthly
Kingdom, to set up good and wholsome Laws, such as be ap|proved;
such as be otherwise he ought to repeal them, and
thrust them out of his Realm; he ought to do justice and judge|ment
in his Kingdom.</P>
<P>Three servants a King ought to have under him as vassals,
fleshly lusts, avarice greedie desires; whom if he keep under
him, as servants, he shall reign well and honorably in his king|dome;
But <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer, omitted these Laws, contra|ry
to his Oath at his Coronation, inserting and placing the
most part of his Laws in his own language to serve his purpose;
and which as yet to this present day, in the same Normane
language do remain. See here by this Declaration the difference
of the two Kings, <HI>Edward</HI> making good Laws, and <HI>William</HI>
changing of them, contrary to his oath at his Coronation, ma|king
Laws at his own pleasure, destructive to the peoples good
and freedome.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
King <HI>Edward,</HI> surnamed <HI>Confessor,</HI> for his excellent holinesse,
is untill this day, called, <HI>St. Edward;</HI> who so soon as he had got|ten
his Fathers Kingdom, of his free-will, released the Kingdom
of 40. thousand pound, called, Dane gilt, which the English
people, even from the very beginning of the reign of the <HI>Danes</HI>
was compelled to pay to their Kings every yeer; and this did
King <HI>Edward</HI> in a yeer when the earth yeelded not her fruit, the
tribute being gathered by the Treasurers, he commanded that
the money should be restored to the owners again. Here we may
see, the love that this King had to the Subjects, freely forgiving
them the tribute that they had payed to other Kings before
him: and this God, saith he, hath chosen, in <HI>Isa.</HI> 58. 6. to loose
the bands of wickednesse, to undo the heavy burthens, to let
the oppressed go free: this kingly act of <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> may
serve for an example for all Governors to follow.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> the Conquerer did contrary to King <HI>Edward,</HI> for he
sought how to inslave the people of <HI>England,</HI> by making inqui|rie
what riches the people had, and then to tax them accor|dingly,
as is declared in the Summary of English Chronicles, in
pag. the 41. King <HI>William</HI> caused enquirie to be made, how ma|ny
acres of ground were sufficient for one plough by the yeer,
how many beasts to the tilling of one hide, how many Cities,
Castles, Farms, Graunges, Towns, Rivers, Marshes, and woods,
what rent they payed by yeer, and how many Knights (or
Souldiers) were in every County of the Realm; all which was
put in writing, and remaineth at <HI>Westminster,</HI> in the Kings trea|surie;
afterward he took six shillings of every plough, that is,
of every hide of Land throughout the Realm; and to this agrees
the report, in the History of the Lives of the 3. Norman Kings
of <HI>England,</HI> in pag. 98. <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer, caused the Land
to be described, in one generall Roll, so that there was not one
hide of Land, but both the yeerly rent, and the owner thereof
was therein set down, how many plough lands, what pastures,
what fennes, or marshes, what woods, Parks Farms, and tene|ments
was in every Sheere, and what every man was worth;
also how many Villens every man had, what beast or cattell,
what fees, what other goods, what rent or commoditie, every
mans possessions did yeeld: this book was called the Roll of
<PB N="5" REF="5">
<HI>Winton,</HI> because it was kept in the City of <HI>Winchester;</HI> by the
English, it was called <HI>Doomes-day book,</HI> either by reason of the
generalitie thereof, or else instead of <HI>Domus Dei</HI> book, for that it
was layed in the Church of <HI>Winchester,</HI> in a place called, <HI>Domus
Dei;</HI> according to this Roll, Taxations were imposed, some|times
two shillings, sometimes six shillings upon every hide of
Land, throughout the Realm; an hide containing twenty acres,
besides ordinary provision for his house.</P>
<P>One of the punishments that was threatned against the chil|dren
of Israel, was to be given into the hands of those their ene|mies
whose Tongue they could not understand. <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. 49, 50,
51, 52. who should take the increase of the Land: And surely so
did <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer squeese the fat of this Land unto
himself, from the Commoners of <HI>England,</HI> as appears by this
declaration of him.</P>
<P>In the Acts and Monuments of the Church, in pag. 173. it is
reported of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer, that forasmuch as he ob|tained
the Kingdom by force and dent of Sword, he changed the
whole state of the governance of this Common-wealth; and to
this agrees the History of the Lives of the three <HI>Normane</HI> Kings
of <HI>England,</HI> in pag. 91. Many heavy taxations were imposed on
the English, their ancient Lords were removed, their ancient
Laws and Pollicies of State were dashed to dust, all lay couched
under the Conquerers Sword to be newly fashioned by him, as
should be best fitting for his advantage. And in the 86. page of
the same History, the stoutest of the Nobility and Gentlemen
were spent either by war or banishment, or by voluntary avoid|ance
out of the Realm, all these he stript of their estates, and in|stead
of them he placed his <HI>Normanes,</HI> insomuch as scarce any
family of the Nobilitie of <HI>England</HI> was left to bear any office, or
any authoritie, within the Realm. And so likewise in the Acts
of the Church, in pa. 173. he gave the <HI>Normanes</HI> the chiefest pos|sessions
of the Land; he changed all the Temporall Laws of the
Realm. And so in the Summary of English Chronicles, in p. 41.
the <HI>Normanes</HI> accomplished their pleasure upon the <HI>English-men,</HI>
that there was no Nobleman of that Nation left to bear rule
over them, so that it was a reproach to be called an <HI>English-man.</HI></P>
<P>In the Acts and Monuments of the Church, in pag. 173. that
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<HI>William</HI> the Conquerer ordained Laws at his own pleasure, pro|fitable
to himself, but grievous and hurtfull to the people; abo|lishing
the Laws of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, whereunto not|withstanding
he was sworn before to observe and maintain,
And so in the Acts of the Church, in pag. 44. he changed all the
Temporall Laws of the Realm. And so likewise again in the
Acts and Monuments of the Church, in pag. 166. contrary to
his Oath at his Coronation, he abolished the Laws of <HI>Edward</HI>
the Confessor, and placed the most part of his own Laws in his
own language to serve his purpose, which as yet to this present
day in the same <HI>Normane</HI> language do remain.</P>
<P>Further, to make the thing in hand clearer, I shall speak as it
is declared in the Lives of the three <HI>Normane</HI> Kings of <HI>England,</HI>
in pa. 101. <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer caused part of those Laws
which he established, to be written in the <HI>Normane</HI> language,
which was a barbarous and broken <HI>French,</HI> not well understood
of the naturall <HI>French,</HI> and not at all of the vulgar <HI>English,</HI> the
residue were not written at all, but left almost arbitrary, to be
determined by reason and discretion at large. Hereupon it fol|lowed
partly through the ignorance of the people, and partly
through malice of some Officers of Justice&punc; who many times are
instruments of secret and particular ends, that many were ex|treamly
tangled, many dangered, many rather made away,
then justly executed. And in the 96. pag. of the same History of
the Lives of the three <HI>Normane</HI> Kings of <HI>England, William</HI> the
Conquerer, in the beginning of his Reign, ordained that the
Laws of King <HI>Edward</HI> should be observed, together with other
Laws that he did prescribe; but afterward he commanded that
nine men out of every County should be chosen, to make a true
report what were the Laws and Customes of the Realm, of these
he changed the greatest part, and brought in the customes of
<HI>Normandy</HI> in their stead, commanding that Causes should be
pleaded, and all matters of form dispatcht in <HI>French.</HI> And in the
Summary of <HI>English</HI> Chronicles, in pa. 41. there sprang up wic|ked
Customes, the more the people spake of equity, the more
wrong was done; the Justicers were authors of all unrighte|ousnesse.</P>
<P>In these words these things offer themselves to consideration.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
First, that the end of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerers Laws was for his
own profit; and that appears by the way that he took, in ma|king
of his Laws in his own language, which was a barbarous
and broken <HI>French,</HI> not well understood of the naturall <HI>French,</HI>
and not at all of the vulgar <HI>English;</HI> so that the people of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
was under a Law that they understood not, which must of
necessitie be a sore and heavie yoke for the people to bear: from
this <HI>Will:</HI> the Conquerer, arose the Law in an unknown tongue,
which to this day is a bondage to the English Nation.</P>
<P><HI>For a Nation to be under a Law that they know not, is to be
under a curse: so in</HI> Deut. 28. 49, 50, 51. The Lord shall bring a Na|tion
against thee as swift as the Eagle flyeth, a Nation whose tongue thou
shalt not understand: A Nation of a fierce countenance, which shall not
regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young. He shall eat
the fruit of thy cattell, the fruit of thy land, untill thou be destroyed: <HI>All
these things have come upon this Land by the</HI> Normanes <HI>in these
words. In the Acts of the Church, he gave the</HI> Normanes <HI>the chief|est
possessions of the Land, he changed all the Temporall Laws
of the Realm.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, the Laws of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer, were, and are
bondages to the <HI>English</HI> Nation; when as by policie he com|manded
that nine men out of every County should be chosen,
to make a true report what were the Laws and customes of the
Realm before the Conquest, and then to change the greatest
part, and bring in the customes of <HI>Normandy</HI> in their stead, com|manding
that Causes should be pleaded, and all matters of
form dispatcht in <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>By this it is apparent, from whom the pleading of Causes by
Lawyers came up; and surely if the thing be well considered, it
is a grievous burden to the Commoners of <HI>England,</HI> that must
give away their money to the Lawyers to plead their Causes:
by this the poore Commoner of <HI>England</HI> payes dear for coming
by that which is his own, when he hath occasion to deal with
the Lawyer.</P>
<P>By this pleading of Causes by Lawyers, the poore Commo|ner
buyes his Law at a very hi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">h and excessive rate; A poore
man may work a quarter or half a yeer, to get as much money
as the tryall of one Suit at Law will cost, and when the Lawyer
<PB N="8" REF="7">
hath pleaded and gotten the money, the thing at last must be
ended by arbitration.</P>
<P>I find in the way two main things to be answered. The first is
this: From what principall the Lawyers and Councellors as
they now stand, did rise.</P>
<P>To this I answer. From an arbitrary power, profitable to
themselves, but grievous and hurtfull to the people; And if the
originall of their standing be looked into, it will so appear. For
the Conquerer making such Laws, as that the Commoners of
<HI>England</HI> could not have the benefit of the Law, but through the
<HI>Normane</HI> Lawyers making merchandize of the Law to the peo|ple,
and so great gains came in to the Lawyer, through this sub|tilty,
and knowing well that by that craft they had their li|ving,
made Laws that none should be a Lawyer, but he that took
his degrees at the Universitie, or Inns of Court: so that it came
to a custome, (and yet is) that parents set their children to
School to study Law, that thereby they might be rich; and ha|ving
learned the Art to use the silver hook they became great:
the parents nor the childe consider not at all the tyranny of the
rice of that custome.</P>
<P>And thus as a childe is bound to a mas<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">er to learn his trade,
and to be a Free man of that place in which he hath served the
time of his Indenture; so the Lawyers through the unjustnesse
of their custome, served a time to come to be a Lawyer, whose
first rice was from the will of a Tyrant.</P>
<P>The originall of a servant serving a time to a master is to
learn a trade, that so he may make the benefit of his ware&punc; even
so the rice of a man being a Lawyer, is that he may sell the Law
to his chapmen (otherwise called Clyants) so that the Law is
bought and sold by the Lawyer and the Clyant.</P>
<P>Surely if this were looked into with an eye of reason, it would
appear to be as unjust, (namely, the practise of Lawyers to in|groce
the Law into their own hands to make merchandize of
it) as the monopolizing Pattentees.</P>
<P>The second <HI>quaere</HI> that may be made, is how the Lawyers ap|pear
to be bondages to the Commoners of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I answer in this, that if any one seek for the benefit of the
Law, he must fee his Lawyer, or else he must loose his right: So
<PB N="9" REF="7">
that as in the time of Christ, the Jews could not have the bene|fit
of their Law but by the <HI>Romane</HI> governors, and that appears
about the tryall and condemning of Christ, they must lead him
away to <HI>Pilate</HI> that he might condemne him, for they could not
of themselves without <HI>Pilate:</HI> Even so the Commoners of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
cannot have the benefit of the Law, but by feeing the <HI>Nor|mane</HI>
custome-upholders.</P>
<P>Another <HI>quaere</HI> may be made. But how should any man come
by that which is his own, but by the Lawyers?</P>
<P>To this I answer. That it is the Law, not the Lawyers, that
gives any man his right; and if there were no Lawyers, yet per|sons
might come by their own by Law. For I reason thus. That
the Lawyers themselves ought to plead according to Law, and
then if it be so, it must be considered, that the ground of the
Lawyers plea ought not to be from themselves, but from the
Law, and so consequently it must follow, that the Lawyers
themselves are in no other place but to get away money from
the Clyant; who might, if things were equally carried, come by
his right without them.</P>
<P>In the History of the Lives of the three <HI>Normane</HI> Kings of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
in pa. 98. saith thus: That <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer ordain|ed
also his Councell of State, his Chancery, his Exchequer, his
Courts of Justice, which alway removed with his Court: these
places he furnished with Officers, and assigned foure Termes in
the yeer, for the determining of controversies among the peo|ple;
whereas before all Suits were summarily hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">d and deter|mined
in the gemote or monthly Convention, in every hundred
without formalities or delay.</P>
<P>If it be looked upon in the Courts of Chancery and Exche|quer,
the Officers that are in those Courts are such as stand by
the <HI>Normane</HI> customes; and that appears in their customes of
pleading Causes for money, making merchandize of the Law,
and so consequently of other Courts of Law; the benefit of ma|king
merchandize of the Law is onely in the hands of Judges,
Councellers, and Lawyers And further, that the Commoners
of <HI>England</HI> may be kept in ignorance from knowing the Law,
that they may live under, and are judged by, all Writs are issued
forth in Latin, and Causes pleaded in Latin.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8">
The second thing that presents it self unto consideration, is
the foure Termes in the yeer, to end controversies among the
people; and the custome of this is a great bondage to the Com|moner
when he hath occasion to go for Law: and the bondage
consists in three things.</P>
<P>First, the coming from all parts of the Kingdom to <HI>Westmin|ster</HI>
foure times a yeer, whereby the poore Commoner is put to
great charges and pains, to get all things ready for his journey,
and many times are constrained to borrow money to bear their
charges, the journey being long, and chargeable; and for the
experience of them that have had to come upon such designes
to <HI>Westminster</HI> from all parts of the Kingdom, testifie by the fil|ling
of their purses at home, and their emptying of them by the
way, and at <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, this is not all: the laying out, and spending of their
money in the long journeys from all parts of the Kingdom to
<HI>Westminster;</HI> but when they come thither, there are Lawyers and
Councellors to fee, which is many times as much and more
twice told, then the clyants expences in his journey. Thus hath
the <HI>Normane</HI> customes brought heavie burdens upon us, and up|on
our fore-fathers in this thing: so that well may that speech
of Christ which he spake to the Lawyers in his time, be justly
applyed to the Lawyers in our time: <HI>Wo unto you also ye Lawyers,
for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be born.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, this is a bondage again in this sence, by hindering
the old custome before the Conquest, (which was) to have eve|ry
mans Cause tryed in the Hundred where he lived, without
coming to <HI>Westminster</HI> at all, and so had justice in the Hundred
once every moneth.</P>
<P>From the things that have been spoken, these things do offer
themselves to our consideration.</P>
<P>First, that for persons so judged by Laws in an unknown
tongue, is an arbitrary power contrary to true reason, and ho|nest
plain dealing.</P>
<P>Secondly, for Lawyers to have money for pleading of causes,
is to make merchandize of the Law to the people.</P>
<P>Thirdly, for the standing and custome of Lawyers, as now
they are, is a representative of slavery and bondage.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="8">
Fourthly, for pleading of Causes in an unknown tongue, is
to take away the key of knowledge: <HI>Luk.</HI> 11. 52. from the people
of their liberties, birth-rights, and Laws; and to keep them in
blindnesse and ignorance.</P>
<P>Fiftly, for coming to <HI>Westminster</HI> from all parts of the King|dom,
is a spending of the Commoners money, loosing of his
time, and neglect of justice done to the Commoner, as was in
that short time once every moneth in every Hundred before the
Conquest.</P>
<P>According unto that equall rule, <HI>As ye would that men should do
unto you, so do you unto them: for this is the Law and the Prophets;</HI> is the
practise of all Arbitrary power whatsoever condemned. And
surely if ever there was an arbitrary power in any thing, it
was, and is in this, to make Laws in an unknown tongue to
govern and rule a people.</P>
<P><HI>The unjustnesse of this custome may more fully appear, if we
look into the manner of Gods giving of his Laws, unto the sons
and daughters of men; if it be looked into in what manner God
gave the Law unto the children of Israel, it will appear to be
given in that tongue they could understand.</HI> Deut. 30. 11, 12, 13.
This Law which I command thee this day, is not hid from thine eyes, nei|ther
is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldst say, Who shall go
up for us into heaven, and bring it unto us, and cause us to hear it, that
we may do it? Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou shouldst say, Who
shall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, and cause us to hear it,
that we may do it? But the word is very neer thee, even in thy mouth,
and in thy heart, to do it.</P>
<P>God deals thus with creatures in his giving of laws unto
them so plainly in that tongue, and manner of way that is
known unto them, that they cannot say, We have not heard it,
nor known it; but it is very neer them, in their mouthes and
hearts to do it; so that they are left without excuse. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 20.</P>
<P>Gods wayes are equall wayes; and therefore he so gave the
Law unto the children of Israel, that they were not to know it
onely themselves, which heard the Law delivered by the hand
of <HI>Moses,</HI> but they were to teach it unto their children, and to
talk of them when they tarried at home, when they walked by
the way, when they rose up, when they lay down, and to put
<PB N="12" REF="9">
them as frontlets between their eyes, and to write them upon
the posts of their doores, and upon their gates, being publickly
to be known, and declared unto all the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Also this manner of making Laws, or giving Command|ments
to people in a known tongue, was practised even by Hea|then:
This appears in</HI> Esther 8. 9. Then were the Kings scribes called
at that time in the third moneth (that is, the moneth Sivan) on the three
and twentieth day thereof, and it was written unto the Iews, and to the
lievtenants, and the deputies and rulers of the Provinces which are from
India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven Provinces, unto every
Province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their
language, and to the Iews according to their writing, and according to
their language. <HI>So much equity was among the Heathen, that in
this thing they are our examples for us to follow their way, to
make laws according to the language of the people that are to
be guided by them.</HI></P>
<P>It is a signe and token of a disobedient servant, that goeth
about to do things contrary to the way and minde of his Ma|ster:
even so is it a signe and token of the Governors of this Na|tion,
that made laws in an unknown tongue, that the people of
this land understand not; to be disobedient stewards unto God.
They are against the nature of God, and against the actings of
God; against his wayes by which he doth manifest himself un|to
the sons and daughters of men in these things.</P>
<P>First, <HI>God is light, and in him there is no darknesse at all.</HI> 1 Joh. 1. 5.
And whatsoever the dealings of God toward the creatures are,
they are light, and make known to the creature the will of God,
and how to know him.</P>
<P>This is clear throughout all the Scripture, from <HI>Genesis</HI> to the
<HI>Revelation. David</HI> saith, <HI>Psal. 119. 105. Thy word is a lamp unto my
feet, and a light unto my paths:</HI> that is, the Law, the Command|ments
of God was his rule that guided his steps. But when the
Law that should guide the Nation is in an unknown tongue, it
is neither lamp nor light for the peoples paths.</P>
<P>This may fully appear, that the wayes of God are light to en|lighten
the people. God sent his Son, whom he saith is light: in
<HI>Isa. 49. 6. A light to lighten the Gentiles:</HI> Luk. 1. 79. <HI>Light to them that sit
in darknesse:</HI> Joh. 9. 5. <HI>The light of the world.</HI> Luk. 1. 77. <HI>To give know|ledge
<PB N="13" REF="9">
of salvation unto people for the remission of sins:</HI> That which
makes Princes, Rulers and People to be like God, are works of
light; of which, one is to make a known Law, in a known lan|guage,
that the people might understand the Law.</P>
<P>It is one of the works of the devill, to blinde the eyes of the
understanding. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 4. and then consider what, and whose
work it was to put it into the heart of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerer
to make Laws in an unknown tongue; and who it is that sits in
the hearts of the Judges, Lawyers and Councellors of this king|dome,
who still hold up the custome of trying the Causes of the
people in an unknown tongue: I suppose it must be concluded
it is the devill, by these Reasons.</P>
<P>First, because the works of the devill are works of darknesse,
and not light; the end shews the event. Now the work to make
Laws in an unknown tongue for this Nation to be guided by,
is a work of darknesse, for the effect of it proves darknesse, and
so brings darknesse, and keeps the people in darknesse, and so
consequently is of the devill. <HI>Do men gather grapes of thorns, and
figs of thistles? by their fruits ye shall know them.</HI> Matth. 7. 16.</P>
<P>Secondly, the works of the devil are destroying works; ther|fore
he is said to be <HI>as a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour:</HI>
1 Pet. 5. 8. And as the devil is said to be as a roaring Lion, so
likewise are tyranous Princes compared to Lions. <HI>Prov. 28. 15.
As a roaring Lion, and a ranging Bear; so is a wicked Ruler over the
poore people.</HI> So that both devill and cruell Princes are compared
both to one thing: then it will follow, that those Laws that are
cruell, and hard yokes for the people to bear, are the works of
the devill in all such rulers.</P>
<P>Now if this thing be examined, namely, the Law in an un|known
tongue, I am bold to say, that it will be found to be one
of the greatest destructives to the well-being and freedome of
the people, as ever was heard of in any Nation. For,</P>
<P>First, those people that are free Commoners of <HI>England</HI> have
been by that blinded, and their eyes closed, that they have not
seen their priviledge in their free birth-rights.</P>
<P>Secondly, they have been constrained to come from all parts
of the Kingdome to <HI>Westminster,</HI> and there commit the pleading
and censure of their Causes to such men as made merchandise
<PB N="14" REF="10">
of the Law, and their Causes as they pleased.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they have been kept, it may be, some 2, 3, 4, or 5.
yeers in Law, whereby the <HI>Normane</HI> custome-upholders have
greatly inriched themselves, by removing the Suit out of one
Court into another, that many times it fals out that the Lawyer
is enriched, but the Clyant undone. Experience proves this to
be a truth.</P>
<P>Again, if this thing be well considered, namely, the Law in
an unknown tongue, it is right opposite to the way of God.</P>
<P>First, in the giving of his Son to be salvation to the ends of
the earth, <HI>Isa.</HI> 49. To open the blinde eyes, this was Christs
work; but the Law in an unknown tongue doth not open the
blinde eyes, but those that are blinde it keeps still in blindnesse:
so in this it is opposite to Christs work.</P>
<P>Secondly, Christ was sent to proclaim liberty to the captives,
<HI>Isa.</HI> 61. 1. But the Law in an unknown tongue proclaims no li|berty,
no glad tydings, no freedome to the oppressed; but de|clares
curse, bondage, and wo. <HI>Deut. 28. 49, 50, 51, 52. Ier.</HI> 5.
15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>One of the priviledges that God promises to his people, <HI>Isa.</HI>
33. 19. is, <HI>Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech
then thou canst perceive; of a ridiculous or stammering tongue, that thou
canst not understand.</HI> So that it is liberty and freedom to be under
a Law that the people can understand. Nothing makes the go|vernment
of <HI>England</HI> to be like the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> so much as
this, to lead and govern people in an unknown tongue. For as
the Papists keep the people in ignorance concerning their spiri|tuall
estate, by an unknown tongue: even so the Judges, Law|yers,
and Councellers keep the people of <HI>England</HI> in ignorance
in their civill or temporall estate, by an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>Further, the Law in an unknown tongue is both against the
way and end that God gave the Law unto the children of Israel,
if we consider the way it was in that tongue they understood,
<HI>Deut</HI> 30. To that it is opposite, and it is opposite also to the end,
which was, first, that it should be in all their mouthes &amp; hearts,
that they might continually talk of them. 2ly, that they might
teach their children. 3ly, that it might be written upon the
posts of their houses, and upon their gates.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="10">
First, it is opposite that the Law should be in all the peoples
mouthes; for it is that it should be in some of the peoples
mouthes, namely, Judges, Councellors, Lawyers, they onely are
to know the Law, and no other by this custome.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Law was given to this end, that the children
might know it, but the Law in the unknown tongue to the con|trary.
For whereas the children of Israel was to teach the Law
unto their children; by this Law in an unknown tongue the pa|rents
of the English children, are constrained to ask counsell of
the Lawyers: and so in this it is directly opposite.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the Law was to write upon posts, and gates, that
therby the people might know the Law generally, being known
so openly. But the Law in an unknown tongue, causeth the Law
to be kept and shewed onely at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the Inns of Court,
and Universities, and Judges, Councellors, and Lawyers Cham|bers.
Thus far to shew the tyranny of the Law in an unknown
tongue over the people of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The second thing that presents it self to our consideration, is
recorded in the History of the Lives of the three <HI>Normane</HI> Kings
of <HI>England,</HI> in pag. 99. that in all those lands that <HI>William</HI> the
Conquerer gave to any man, he reserved dominion in chief to
himself; for acknowledgement whereof a yeerly rent was payed
unto him, and also a Fine whensoever the tenement did allen
or dye; these were bound as clyants unto him by oath of fide|litie
and homage: and if any dyed his heir being in minoritie,
the King received the profits of the land, and had the custodie
and disposing of the heirs body untill his age of 21. yeers.</P>
<P>These words declare unto us two great bondages that have
been in <HI>England;</HI> the one is thrown down by this Honourable
Court of Parliament, called, <HI>The Court of Wards;</HI> the other bon|dage
remaineth still untaken away: Of that I intend somewhat
to speak.</P>
<P>The bondage being looked upon with a single eye, will ap|pear
to be great two wayes. First, in the greatnes of it in extent.
Secondly, in the heavinesse of it upon the poore man.</P>
<P>First, for the greatnesse of the extent of it, and that is over
every one dwelling in a Town; except the Lords of the Mannor
who is the yoke-master, and not a sufferer under the yoke.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="11">
The heavinesse of it appears in these two things. First, when
a man hath bought a piece of Copyhold-land so called, when
he hath payed for his Copyhold-land of the owner thereof, yet
notwithstanding must pay a Fine to the Lord of the Mannor, or
else he cannot enjoy it. This is a most grievous oppression upon
the people.</P>
<P>Secondly, when the party either leaveth his Living, then an|other
Fine is to be payed; and also when the party dyeth, then
a Harriot, so called, is to be payed again.</P>
<P>Those who are Countreymen, and deal in Farmes and Land,
I suppose can testifie this by wofull experience; and therefore I
leave this to their consideration: onely I shall shew how the
Lord complaineth of such things in Scripture.</P>
<P>This oppression doth reach the poore widows that hath lost
their husbands, and is left poore, comfortlesse and needie, their
stay, their upholdes is dead, and yet notwithstanding must loose
the best goods they have for an Harriot to the Lord of the Man|nor.
This or such like kinde of oppression <HI>Iob</HI> spake of, <HI>Iob</HI> 24. 9.
they <HI>take a pledge of the poore.</HI> And <HI>Isa. 10. 2. turn aside the needie from
judgement, and take away the right of the poore of my people, that widows
may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherlesse.</HI> What greater
wrong can be done to any, then to take their goods, that which
is properly the parties own?</P>
<P>Among the children of Israel was found such like grievous
oppression: <HI>Ier. 5. 26, 27, 28. For among my people are found wicked
men: they lay wait as he that setteth snares, they set a trap, they catch men
As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they
are become great, and waxen rich. They are waxen fat, they shine, they
overpasse the deeds of the wicked.</HI> The snares that are set by Rulers
to catch the people, are those grievous Laws that are like snares,
that the people by this means are brought into great bondages
and slavery, under cruell masters. As witnesse when a man hath
bought a piece of land before he can enjoy it, he must pay a Fine
to the Lord of the Mannor; and if he come not in to take it up
in the Court, he then forfeits his land.</P>
<P>What righteousnes is in such a law or custome, I finde very
little or none at all; but against righteousnes, justnes and equi|tie,
to practise such arbitrary tyrannous customes, grievous for
the people to bear.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="11">
Now then it is not to be looked upon, whether it be not right to
pay Fines or Harriots to the Lord of the Mannor, according to that
Law or custome that is now in <HI>England</HI> for that purpose&punc; but it ought
to be known whether that Law that demandeth such unreasonable
things, as Fines and Harriots to the Lord of the Mannor, be accor|ding
to the rule of equitie. And then I suppose that if that be the
<HI>quaere,</HI> it will be answered, that such a Law is not according to the
law of equity: for these Reasons.</P>
<P>First, that Law that tendeth onely to that end to inslave the peo|ple
in bondage under heavie burthens, cannot be concluded to be
according to the Law of equitie: for God saith that this pleaseth
him. <HI>Isa. 58. 6. To lo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">se the bands of wickednesse, to undo the heavy burdens,
to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke</HI> So that in this, obe|dience
is better then sacrifice. For what doth it avail the people to
have Fasts set up, and Humiliations observed by the great ones of
the land, and have not their burdens and yokes taken off from them?</P>
<P>Secondly, that Law that tendeth (to this end) to oppresse the wi|dow
and the fatherlesse, cannot be concluded to be according to the
Law of equitie. God saith expresly in <HI>Exod. 22. 22. Ye shall not afflict
any widow or fatherlesse childe.</HI> And in <HI>Zach.</HI> 7. 10. God tels them that
they should not oppresse the fatherles nor the widow. This was that
which God alwayes exhorts the people unto by the mouthes of the
Prophets: <HI>Zach. 7. 7. Isa. 58. 6. Isa.</HI> 1. 17. Then if it be considered, that
the widows are not to be opprest, the Law of taking of Harriots of
widows must be concluded to be Arbitrary power over the poore
people. Thus far to shew the arbitrarinesse of Fines, and Rents, and
Harriots that are payed to the Lord of the Mannor,</P>
<P>I shall apply my self to give an Exhortation to the Commoners of
<HI>England,</HI> that they may see the great works of God, that the Lord
hath shewed from time to time unto this Nation since these troubles
began, that they might have them in their remembrance.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Exhortation.</HEAD>
<P>GLorious and great things hath the Lord the great <HI>Iehovah</HI> shew|ed
unto this Nation since these troubles began; and if well con|sidered,
they are the dealings of mercy toward us, even thoughts of
love, and of peace and good will, If we consider the knowledge of
our bondages that are now brought to light, that have of long time
<PB N="18" REF="12">
inslaved this Nation for almost six hundred yeers, that were brought
upon us by Conquest, and from the wills of tyrants over the people,
as the Law in an unknown tongue, the standing of the Societie of the
Lawyers, the pleading of Causes in an unknown tongue in West|minster-Hall,
the foure Termes in the yeer, the feeing of Lawyers,
the being kept ignorant from knowing the Law, and their birth|rights,
the bondage of Rents, and Fines, and Harriots to the Lord of
the Mannor, the burden of Tythes: all these things have, and are
looked into to be tyrannous to the Nation. And although the Land
hath suffered much since these wars began, yet wars could not be
avoided, but they must needs be. For as the bondages of this Nation
came in by the Sword, even so by the Sword the liberties thereof
must be gained: and that will appear, because the Rulers of this land
having brought the people into bondage, there was no way for their
greatnesse to fall, but by the Sword. This way in the eyes of God was
good, and the Sword hath prevented those actings of oppression even
in the same members themselves; if we do but minde it, as last Sum|mer,
when they made an Ordinance for to persecute men for con|science,
then presently after was the rising in <HI>Kent,</HI> and <HI>Essex;</HI> also
when they would have brought home the King upon his termes, by
a Treaty, they were disappointed in that also. By these actings of
God it is evident, that he will destroy those things that are of the
flesh in Noblemen, to hinder them in the gentry: to hinder them in
others, to hinder them that he onely may be exalted.</P>
<P>Oh therefore look upon the work of God, rather then to look up|on
men according to dignities; For as dignities are of the earth, so
they must be brought lowe, even to the ground: So that men shall
not be looked upon as in reference to dignities, but their actings shal
be looked upon, whether they be good or evill, and so accordingly
judged. Therefore now in this time of searching, let every one en|devour
to know those things that are freedom and liberty, free from
arbitrarinesse and ungodlinesse, that they may know that which is
profitable to all the Commonaltie of the Kingdom, things good and
wholsome to all the people of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The end of my writing this Discourse, is, first to give the Com|moners
of <HI>England</HI> knowledge, from whom the bondages that have
inslaved the Nation proceeded.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the Commoners of <HI>England</HI> may see how clear these
<PB N="19" REF="12">
bondages are against God, against his way, and against freedom and
liberty.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that the Commoners of <HI>England</HI> seeing of the unjustnesse
of such customes, may look for customes of liberty and freedome,
which is the desire of a Commoner of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>For the further satisfaction of those that shall read and meditate
upon this foregoing discourse, I shall quote some Scriptures that
speaks against the wayes of men, that make, follow, and uphold the
customes before mentioned, that they are against the minde of God,
as he hath declared in word; and also threatneth punishments unto
those that practise them.</P>
