<P>_RIght Honourable Lorde;
The gratious and well de|seruing,
when they die,
leaue behind them a repu|tation
that can neuer die.
I instance this in Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of
blessed memory: A Lady beyond example,
beautifyed with the ornaments of <HI>Grace</HI>
and <HI>Nature</HI> (the twoo handes of God)
whose name (like the aire) is spread ouer
<PB REF="3">
all the earth, whereby this our little world
(the English nation) is made famous to
all posteritie. And because I my selfe haue
seene many the admirations of her time,
&amp; haue with many others shared in par|ticipation
of those blessings which God
did giue her most gratious and fortunate
gouernement; I haue therefore (willing|ly)
forced my endeuours to this demon|stration
of thankes, hauing euer vowed
my selfe a seruant to her Honourable re|membrance.
The reasons (my good L.)
of dedication are these: First, your Lord|ships
honorable deseruing, in being a prin|cipall
Supporter of the leaning State of
learning, the <HI>Moecenas</HI> and Patron of
the learned (in what deseruing qualitie
soeuer:) wherein, (though I be but meane|ly
profest) yet, your Lordeships zealous
regard to the profession I beare, shal euer
binde me in the most assured bonds of du|tie
<PB REF="3">
and thankefull seruice. Againe, that
honorable testimony of your Lordships re|garde,
euen to the very name of your late
Soueraigne, approued by the generall ap|plause
and acclamation of all good people:
by which act, your Lordship hath procee|ded
to the highest degree of good opinion,
and by giuing Honour to her that best de|serued
it, deseruedly made your selfe much
honoured.</P>
<P>And therefore (my good Lord) haue
I ventured on your Lordships gratious ac|ceptance,
humbly requesting your Honor,
that my particular (howsoeuer vnworthy,
to trauaile in so honorable an Argument)
may (notwithstanding) haue gratious ac|ceptation,
being presented in the name of
Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to whose honorable
remembraunce your Lordeship is so much
deuoted, and to whose name I haue prin|cipally
dedicated this seruice: beseech|ing
<PB REF="4">
Almightie God to deriue vppon your
Name and House, a perpetuall Suc|cession
of Honour and good Fortune.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Honours
in all duetie and
humble seruice.

<HEAD>&leaf;To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_THe name of Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> is sufficient
Argument to perswade a friendly acceptati|on;
and from the better disposed (whome I
couet principally to please) I shall doubtlesse
receiue that reasonable and honest construc|tion.
As for those who haue their tongues
dipt in the poyson of Enuie, I write not to please them,
who wil neuer be pleasd with that which is most deseruing;
It being the nature of Enuie, to depraue that, which dooth
deserue the highest fauour of loue and good opinion. I may
example this in the wrong offered to the name of Queene
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who (though shee were the most admired of her
time) hauing extraordinary induments, and a gouernment,
much more in the degrees of honour and prosperitie, than
any her Predecessours: yet want there not malitious and
base deprauers, who (like dogges that barke against the
Sunne) couet to bite her honourable name, whome God
hath made more glorious than the Sunne, giuing her a place
of glorie, in fellowship with his holy Angelles and Saints.
For this double respect haue I therefore taken these paines:
First to please the well affected, in honouring her whome
all that haue honesty will honour: Next, in giuing Enuie
and her sonnes a morsell to bite vpon; wishing that all the
deprauers of her princely name, may either reduce them|selues
some degree of honestie, or else perish with their
enuious and euill breath, Accept then (I pray thee) these my
voluntarie trauells; and honour her remembraunce, whome
all the best in the world do honour with admiration, which
thou also wilt doe, if thou beest either honest, or truely En|glish.</P>

<L>How can you then be true to any other?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How is't your Grace should thus contend with heauen,</L>
<L>With God, with Angells, and with holy Saints;</L>
<L>How is't that thus to <HI>Luther</HI> you haue giuen</L>
<L>Your soule, which he with blackenesse all depaints,</L>
<L>Who is't this heresie with you acquaints?</L>
<L>(Alas good Ladie) <HI>Luther</HI> doth not well,</L>
<L>To drawe your Grace and many moe to hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O giue me leaue alittle to aduise,</L>
<L>(I doe not know how fortunate I may,)</L>
<L>To leaue the danger of your heresies;</L>
<L>Let <HI>Luther</HI> beare them with himselfe away;</L>
<L>Sith you are lost I will direct your way.</L>
<L>And will you follow but as I direct,</L>
<L>You shall arriue the place of Gods elect.</L>

<L>What should I speake of <HI>Perrie</HI> who was sent,</L>
<L>To short her life with his base treacherous hand;</L>
<L>Or yet of him, who with the like intent,</L>
<L>Came to surprise her with an armed band;</L>
<L>Or how with fire she did in danger stand.</L>
<L>There are both these, and many moe behinde,</L>
<L>Whose repetition would but grieue my minde.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet can it not in my remembrance die,</L>
<L>How Spanish <HI>Philip</HI> did this Ladie friend;</L>
<L>That he could pittie her extreamitie,</L>
<L>That he his louing fauour did extend,</L>
<L>That he would praise, that he her gifts commend:</L>
<L>By this we see their malice was but vaine,</L>
<L>Mercie will come, although it come from <HI>Spaine.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So well the Kings perswasion could preuaile,</L>
<L>As that the Queene did for her Sister send;</L>
<L>The message did with feare her heart assaile,</L>
<L>And sure she thinkes some euill they intend;</L>
<L>How ere it be (she saith) I recommend</L>
<L>Into thy hands, (O sacred Lord of heauen)</L>
<L>My selfe, and all that to my selfe is giuen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thus prepar'd, she iournies to the Court,</L>
<L>Where in her chamber prison-like retirde,</L>
<L>She liues shut vp from any ones resort.</L>
<L>The Bishop that this Ladies bloud desirde,</L>
<L>To quench his heart with burning enuy firde;</L>
<L>Comes to her furnisht with his studious care,</L>
<L>Hoping with craft the Princesse to insnare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="26">
<L><HI>Gardner,</HI> it is in vaine thou her assaile,</L>
<L>Whome God protects with his almightie hand;</L>
<L>Canst thou against the liuing God preuaile?</L>
<L>Or canst thou his all-able powre withstand?</L>
<L>Or canst thou God and holy heauen command?</L>
<L>(Bishop be sure) they are deceiued farre</L>
<L>That thinke (with God) to make preuailing warre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Therefore thy euill had but bad euent,</L>
<L>How ere made strong with thy contriuing wit,</L>
<L>Because thy euill to the good was meant,</L>
<L>And God would not be pleasd to fauour it;</L>
<L>Though earth and hell in busie counsell sit,</L>
<L>God countermaunds what ere they deuise,</L>
<L>And makes them foolish, that are iudged wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And <HI>Winchester,</HI> we instance this in thee,</L>
<L>Whose houres in studious care were euer spent,</L>
<L>To bring this Ladie her extreamitie:</L>
<L>Yet for that God did see thy hearts intent,</L>
<L>He blunts thy edge (O bloudie instrument;)</L>
<L>And (belows-like) he make thy enuious breath,</L>
<L>To make hir liue, thou woldst haue blowne to death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus God can mocke the subtilties of men,</L>
<L>Letting them runne the passage they propose;</L>
<L>Seeming regardlesse, yet regardfull then,</L>
<L>His eie their hidden secrets can disclose;</L>
<L>For Prouidence in euery passage goes:</L>
<L>That howsoere mens pollicies doe plot,</L>
<L>They haue had issue if God fauour not.</L>

<L>So God was pleasd with prouidence and care,</L>
<L>This vertuous holy Lady to defend.</L>
<L>To binde their force, and breake their hidden snare,</L>
<L>That euill men for euill did intend.</L>
<L>And now the Queene doth for her Sister send;</L>
<L>Where when she was presented on her knee,</L>
<L>She thus protesteth her integrity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>(Dread Soueraigne) I your seruant here present</L>
<L>My selfe as true vnto your life and state,</L>
<L>As is the spirite of an innocent;</L>
<L>And so let God my griefe extenuate,</L>
<L>As I doe wish you to be fortunate:</L>
<L>And let the heauens their benefits denie</L>
<L>To all that enuy at your Maiestie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Queene with angry maiestie then saith,</L>
<L>You stand too much vpon your innocence,</L>
<L>Too confident in your suspected faith,</L>
<L>It would be better to cast off pretence,</L>
<L>And plainely to acknowledge your offence.</L>
<L>(The Princesse saide) The guiltie should confesse,</L>
<L>And so would I, if I had guiltinesse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But God that sees the very secret thought,</L>
<L>Knowes in my heart there is no guiltines;</L>
<L>That there was neuer any treason wrought,</L>
<L>Or any thought of such vnworthines.</L>
<L>If then I should against my selfe confesse;</L>
<L>I bring my selfe an euerlasting shame,</L>
<L>To brand the reputation of my name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="28">
<L>O let it please your Princely maiestie,</L>
<L>That I your seruant may receiue this grace;</L>
<L>That Law it selfe my innocence may trie,</L>
<L>That Law may be impartiall in this case:</L>
<L>And if that Law doe quit me of disgrace,</L>
<L>Then let your seruant haue a gratious eie;</L>
<L>If not, let Lawe and Iustice make me die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you be then so righteous (saith the Queene)</L>
<L>Belike you'l say, that we vnrighteous are;</L>
<L>And that your troubles haue vnrighteous beene,</L>
<L>And so the guilt on vs you doe transferre,</L>
<L>And make them righteous that vnrighteous are:</L>
<L>And so to make your owne purgation,</L>
<L>You lay on vs the imputation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Ladie then: let not my Soueraigne</L>
<L>Haue that construction of my duteous heart;</L>
<L>Long may your reputation God maintaine,</L>
<L>And much may he inlarge your high desart:</L>
<L>And (if I may my secret heart impart)</L>
<L>(I do protest) it doth my spirit good,</L>
<L>To see such honour in my neerest blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And for the sorrowes that I doe indure,</L>
<L>I know the cause is not your owne desire;</L>
<L>But that some other did the hurt procure,</L>
<L>And stirr'd your anger with their enuious fire;</L>
<L>Against your Grace and me, they doe conspire,</L>
<L>That would the neerenesse of our loue diuide,</L>
<L>Whome God and Nature haue so neerely tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="29">
<L>Nature (euen in the Queene) was powrefull strong&punc;</L>
<L>And makes her spirit haue a feeling sense;</L>
<L>And now she thinkes her Sister hath had wrong,</L>
<L>And in her heart she blames their diligence,</L>
<L>That causlesse thus did cause this great offence:</L>
<L>(And to her selfe she saith) I doe offend,</L>
<L>Are we not Sisters? why should we contend?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet would she not expresse her inward heart,</L>
<L>Nor then giue demonstration of her loue;</L>
<L>Nor did she then to any one impart,</L>
<L>What she in her intention did approue:</L>
<L>But (sure) she had a purpose to remoue</L>
<L>The fire of indignation from her breast,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Steuen</HI> had kindl'd with so much vnrest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sequele did approue the good intent;</L>
<L>For now the beames of mercie doe appeare,</L>
<L>The Queene doth free her long imprisonment,</L>
<L>Remoues her Gailer whome she most did feare,</L>
<L>And now she giues her licence to repaire</L>
<L>Vnto her home; where when she did arriue,</L>
<L>A peacefull quiet doth her griefe depriue.</L>

<L>Now I haue runne the passage I intended,</L>
<L>(I do not know how fortunate I runne;)</L>
<L>My verse is done now that her griefe is ended.</L>
<L>And she at rest, my busie care is done;</L>
<L>The cloudes do vanish that be dimm'd this Sunne.</L>

<L>So matchlesse was she, and so wondrous rare,</L>
