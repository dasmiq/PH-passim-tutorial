<HEAD>CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a Lady of excellent Conversation,</HEAD>
<P>_YOu would not onely Imagine
all the <HI>Muses,</HI> but all the <HI>Gra|ces</HI>
were in her too, whilest
for <HI>matter, words,</HI> &amp; <HI>manner</HI>
she is all that is delightfull
in Conversation; her <HI>matter</HI> not stale
and studied, but resent and occasional;
not stiff, but ductile and pliable to the
company; high not soaring, familiar
not low, profound not obscure; and the
more sublime the more intelligible
and conspicuous. Her <HI>Words</HI> not too
scanty, nor too wide, but just fitted
to her <HI>matter,</HI> not intricately involving,
but clearly unfolding and explicating
the notions of her minde. In <HI>Manner,</HI>
Majestique, not imperious, conversation
thats a <HI>Tyranny,</HI> with others being a <HI>Com|mon-wealth</HI>
with her, where every ones
<PB N="2" REF="6">
discourse and opinions are free; she ne|ver
contradicting, but when any speak
impertinently, only blushing for them,
and saying no more: (a greater repre|hension
to those, who understand blush|ing,
than can be exprest in words,) Ha|ving
too much reason to call passion to
her ayde, and disdaining to use force
and violence (the ordinary Arms of fal|shood)
to defend the Truth, so if you
yeeld not, she does rather than contend,
leaving you the shame of a <HI>victory,</HI> when
with more honour, you might have yeel|ded
and been overcome: Nor does she
rashly take up Argument, and abruptly
lay it down again; but handsomely as|sume
it; delightfully continue it, and
like an <HI>Aire</HI> in <HI>musick,</HI> just then, when the
ear expects, it comes unto a close: All in
her being sweet, delightfull and harmo|nious,
even to the very Tone and Accent
of her voice, it being more <HI>musick</HI> to
hear her speak than others sing. Then
shees withall so easie Company, and far
from all constraint, as tis pleasure to be
in it: whilest others like uneasie gar|ments,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
you cannot stir in without pain;
which renders her conversation far
chearfuller then theirs who laugh more
but smile lesse, spending more spirits
with straining for an houres mirth than
they can recover in a moneth again;
which renders them so unequall compa|ny,
whilest she is alwayes equall and the
same. True joy being a constant serious
thing; as far different from light and
gigling <HI>mirth,</HI> as <HI>Elementall</HI> fire from
<HI>squibs</HI> and <HI>Crackers;</HI> whence she <HI>Prome|theus</HI>-like
inspire all who converse with
her, with noble flame and spirit, none
ever departing from her company but
wiser and far better than they came. It
being <HI>vertue</HI> to know her, <HI>wisdome</HI> to
converse with her, <HI>Refinest</HI> breeding to
observe her, <HI>joy</HI> to behold her, and a <HI>spe|cies</HI>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of one that is the foyle of good Conver|sation.</HEAD>
<P>HE is t' others <HI>Antipodes,</HI> &amp; of a quite

some stale Common-places, like cold
meat grown nauseous with often repe|tition;
or else some new whimsies of his
own, like <HI>French quelques choses,</HI> with no
substance at all in them: his <HI>words</HI> or
low, and creeping (the very <HI>reptils</HI> of a
language) or so affectedly high and ram|ping,
as if <HI>Eloquence</HI> stalkt and went on
<HI>stilts:</HI> his <HI>manner</HI> every wayes ungrate|full,
in a tone harsh and untunable;
with Tempests in his mouth, and Light|ning
in his eyes, whilest he strains his
voice to speak loudest in the company,
and heats and grows red-hot presently,
by force of Argument: impatient of con|tradiction,
and contradicting every one;
so obstinate in his opinion, as <HI>Faith</HI>
that removes mountains, can never re|move
him from't: whence he frieghts
<PB N="5" REF="7">
all from his conversation; their words
(just as in an enemies Country, in Gar|rison,
daring not to stir out for fear of a
surprize) Tis a Tyranny then to con|verse
with him, none but slaves and pa|rasites
would endure (content to swal|low
his words whilest they feed on him)
whose enduring it, makes him so intole|rable
to all besides, so as the wise avoid
his company (just as they would savage
Beasts Tam'd, who unlesse you sooth and
humour them are apt on every light oc|casion
to start and break out to their na|tive
savagnes) not always to be in feaver
of such an Accident, and sick of his con|versation;
has neither wit for discourse,
breeding for civility, understanding to
know it, nor patience to learn; but by
Pride, Obstinancy and Presumption is
forfeited to perpetuall folly and igno|rance.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of an excellent Companion.</HEAD>
<P>HE is the life and spirit of the Com|pany,
that pines and droops with|out
him, animating all with chearfulness,
and is like sparkling liquor to your <HI>dull
companion,</HI> thats only <HI>dregs</HI> and <HI>lees;</HI> his
presence chases melancholly, as the <HI>Suns</HI>
does clouds, and tis impossible to be sad
in his company; He differs from the <HI>Buf|foon,</HI>
as an excellent <HI>Comedy</HI> do's from the
<HI>Farse,</HI> being pure wit, tother but foolery:
He is never dry nor pumping, but al|wayes
full and flowing; his returns and
<HI>reparties</HI> so quick, opposite and gentile,
tis pleasure to observe, how handsomely
he acquits himself; mean time he is nei|ther
scurrulous nor profane, but a good
man as well as a good companion; and
so far a good fellow too, as hee'le take a
chearfull glasse or two (your fine edged
knives alwayes needing the whet-stone
most) whilest taking too many, is like
<PB N="7" REF="8">
whetting the edge quite away: he is the
onely exorcist for the Melancholly <HI>Devill</HI>
of the times; and I imagine him just like
<HI>David</HI> playing to <HI>Saul,</HI> and they just like
<HI>Saul</HI> persecuting him: He seeming to
your men of businesse to confer but little
to the seriouser part of life; yet he whets
the knife of the serious man, and is to
businesse as <HI>Musick</HI> to <HI>devotion,</HI> apting
and disposing the mind to it afterwards,
tho for the present delightfully, diver|ting
it. In fine, he ows much of his good
humour to his complexion, but much
more to his company (alwayes the best
and noblest) so he may be poor, but never
want, or if he do, it is the fault of the
times, and none of his, of which when
he meets with a favourable conjunction,
he is most commonly the Artisan of his
own Fortune, making himself (with a
little industry) afar better than others are
born unto, being the darling of all your
great ones, and nobler sort, the favourite
of Kings, and companion for any Prince.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<HEAD>CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of one that Zanys the good Companion.</HEAD>
<P>HE is a wit of an under Region, gros|ly
imitating on the lower roap,
what t' other do's neatly on the higher;
and is only for the laughter of the vul|gar;
whilest your wiser and better sort
can scarcely smile at him: He talks no|thing
but kennel-raked stuff, and his dis|course
is rather like fruit tane up rotten
from the ground, than freshly gathered
from the Tree. He is so far from a court|ly
wit, as his breeding seems only to
have been i'th' Suburbs; or at best, he
seems onely graduated good companion
in a Tavern (the Bedlam of wits) where
men are mad rather than merry; here
one breaking a jest on the Drawer, or a
Candestick: there an other repeating the
old end of a Play, or some bawdy song;
this speaking bilke, that non-sense,
whilest all with loud houting and laugh|ter
<PB N="9" REF="9">
confound the <HI>Fidlers</HI> noise, who may
well be call'd a noise indeed, for no <HI>Mu|sick</HI>
can be heard for them; so whilest he
utters nothing but old stories, long since
laught thrid-bare, or some stale jest bro|ken
twenty times before: His <HI>mirth</HI>
compared with theirs, new and at first|hand,
is just like <HI>Brokers</HI> ware in compa|rison
with <HI>Mercers,</HI> or <HI>Long-lane</HI> com|par'd
unto <HI>Cheap-side:</HI> his wit being ra|ther
the <HI>Hogs-heads</HI> than his own, favour|ring
more of <HI>Heidelberg</HI> than of <HI>Hellicon,</HI>
and he rather a drunken than a good
companion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<HEAD>CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of one that imitates the good companion another way.</HEAD>
<P>HE is on, who now the stage is down
Acts the <HI>Parasites</HI> part at Table; and
since <HI>Tailors</HI> death, none can play <HI>Mosco</HI>'s
part so well as he: he is alwayes for him
who has best Wine &amp; fare (Body &amp; Soul
and all) and sooths and humours them,
even to be of the same opinion and Re|ligion
with them (right or wrong,) mean
time although he be specially devoted to
the <HI>Patron;</HI> he praises the <HI>Cook,</HI> shakes
the <HI>Butler</HI> by the hand, and is familiar
with all the Waiters and Serving-men;
calling one <HI>Father,</HI> adopting another
<HI>son,</HI> as they are of Age, or Office in the
House; though he be as pernitious in a
Family, as Moaths, Cankers, or Poyson,
to Mettle, Cloaths, or health; corrupting
his Patrons manners to render them
more like his own, and impoisoning
<PB N="11" REF="10">
their ears with calumnying other men,
only to ingrosse them wholly to himself:
Mean time he is so ill natured, as to serve
his end he will fawn on his deadliest e|nemies;
and those once served abuse his
dearest friends; equally treacherous
both to friend and enemie; for the rest,
although with the ignorant, he passe for
a good companion, tis no pure wit he ut|ters,
but only a mingly of clenches, quib|bles,
and such half-witted stuff he (at
best) being rather a <HI>pump</HI> of others jests,
Conceits, and Storys, than a <HI>Fountain</HI> of
his own; so he is presently draw dry (af|ter
a meal or two) when his mirth fail|ing
and waxing stale he is forced to fall
to plain flattery, or they grow weary of
him strait, as of dead Wine, pottage cold,
or meat served up to the Table, more
than once.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<HEAD>CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of an irresolute Person.</HEAD>
<P>HE hovers in his choice, like an em|pty
Ballance with no waight of
Judgement to incline him to either scale;
he dodges with those he meets, nor
he can ever resolve which way to let
them passe: every thing he thinks on,
is matter of deliberation, and he does
nothing readily, but what he thinks not
on: discourse that helps others out of
<HI>laborinths,</HI> is a <HI>laborinth</HI> to him; and he of
all creatures would be far wiser, if he had
none at all: he begins nothing without
deliberation; and when he begins
to deliberate, never makes an end. Has
some dull <HI>demon</HI> cryes, <HI>do not, do not</HI> still,
when hee's on point of doing any thing,
which he obeys as a divine Revelation:
He plays at <HI>shall I, shall I?</HI> so long, till o|pertunity
be past, and then as he did the
fault, repents at leasure. He is enemy to
<PB N="13" REF="11">
Resolution, or rather as Resolution were
enemy to him, his heart fails him; and
like a coward he turns back presently, at
sight of it: He still misliking the present
choice of things as <HI>Scoggan</HI> did his Tree to
hang on: He could never Bet at Cocking
nor Hors-race yet, because the battaile or
race was alwayes done or he could deli|brat
which side to take, &amp; he is only hap|py
in this, that his irresolution hinders
him from marrying and entring into
Bonds: Nor ist (perhaps) the least part
of his happinesse to be as long in choo|sing
his Religion now, amongst so many
new Sects, that sprout up every day;
though tis thought he is a <HI>Quaker;</HI> and
if he be superstitious withall, he is in for
his wits, and next news you hear from
him will be from <HI>Bedlam.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a Fantastique Lady.</HEAD>
<P>HEr life is a perpetuall contradicti|on,
she would and she would not,
and <HI>make ready the Coach, yet let it alone
too; drive to such a place, yet do not neither,</HI>
Is her ordinary dialect: she differs from
the <HI>irresolute,</HI> in that he is alwayes begin|ning,
and she never makes an end; she
writes and blots out again, whilest he de|liberates
what to write: t'on being a <HI>resty,</HI>
tother a <HI>restless</HI> pain: so you can tell what
to make of ton's Negative, and how two
Negatives make an Affimative; but of
her <HI>I</HI> and <HI>no</HI> together, you know not
what to make, but only that she knows
not what to make of it her self. Her head
is just like a Mill, or Squirrels cage, and
her minde the Squirrel that turns and
whirls it round, and her imagination dif|fers
from others, as your <HI>Grotesque</HI> figures
do from naturall and from <HI>grotesque;</HI>
In that these have some design in them,
<PB N="15" REF="12">
but her imagination has none: She ne|ver
looking towards the end, but onely
the beginning of things; or if she does,
forgets or disapproves it strait: For she
will call in all hast for one, and have no|thing
to say to him when he is come;
and long (nay dye) for some <HI>toy</HI> or <HI>trifle,</HI>
which having once, she grows weary of
presently, and throws away. In fine, who
are of one minde to day, and another to+morrow,
are constant to her, and <HI>Saturns</HI>
revolution compared unto the <HI>Moons;</HI>
For you know not where to have her a
moment, and whosoever would hit her
thoughts must shoot flying; and fly
themselves whosoever would follow her</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a Green-sicknesse Girle.</HEAD>
<P>SHe is like a Mouse in a Holland
Cheese, her house and diet all the
same: whence the more she spends in
her house, the worse house she keeps, the
walls being both her Kitchen and Larder
too, of which she eats so long, as she ful|fills
the old proverb at last, <HI>The weakest go
to the walls:</HI> For which should they ac|cuse
her of <HI>Buglary,</HI> she has this commo|dity,
she could never be starv'd in Pri|son,
but whilest some eat themselves in|to
Prison, she (by the <HI>Estridge</HI> help) might
eat her self out again: She is a great be|nefactrix
to Masons, who wher they find
her are sure to finde work enough, and
her zeale is so great, she has a minde to
the Church-walls too, where she might
sooner eat up all the ten Command|ments,
by breaking her fast, than break
the Commandments of the Church: no
Nunnery would hold her, but shee'd
<PB N="17" REF="13">
break inclosure presently, though for
strictnesse of dyet, (however she eat whit|meat)
shee'd put down any <HI>Minume</HI> or
<HI>Carthusian;</HI> for a peck of Oats would
serve her a week at least, whence you
are not to wonder if in questioning
her you finde her somewhat meal|mouthed
in answering you. By her
complexion, she seems rather made of
chalk or marle, than that red earth
<HI>Adam</HI> was made of; though she be so
meager a soile, she grows never the
fatter by it; yet one knows not what a
good Husbandman may do, for they say, <HI>a
good Husband</HI> would remedy all; but he
must take her on credit then, both for
Beauty and good housewivery; few else
would venture on her complexion, and
such a quality, as if she hold on as she be|gins,
she soon would eat her husband out
of house and home: Onely a Millar
would take her with all faults, she being
much of his complexion, and for her diet
twould be at others charge, rather than
his own; neither are the walls of his
Wind-mil comprized in her Bill of Fare.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a talkative Lady.</HEAD>
<P>HEr tongue runs round like a wheele
one spoak after another, there is no
end of it: she makes more noice and
jangling than the Bels on the fifth of <HI>No|vember,</HI>
or a Coronation day; such a wife
for <HI>Moroso</HI> had far surpast all the variety
of noices invented for tormenting him;
and would make a husband wish that ei|ther
she were dumb, or he were deaf:
You would wonder at her matter to hear
her talk, and would admire her talk,
when you heard her matter; but consi|dering
both together, would admire:
nor wonder at neither, but onely exclaim
with him, who plum'd the Nightingal, <HI>she
is a voice and nothing else,</HI> for tis nothing
but noice she makes, and tis the labour of
her tongue not brain; whence you
would only wonder how that holds out,
but for that it moves with as great facili|ty,
<PB N="19" REF="14">
as leaves wag when they are shaken
with the winde (give her tongue breath,
and it will never lie still) or rather in|deed
as <HI>Atomes</HI> move its aire, for tis quite
unhung, and neither depends on nerve
nor imagination; there being as much
difference betwixt a voluble tongue and
hers, as betwixt an excellent vaulter
moves artfully, and one who art-lesly
precipitates himself: all the wonder is,
whilest she speaks onely <HI>Thrums,</HI> how she
makes so many different ends hold to|gether
(the composition of a Taylors
Cushion, all of shreds, being nothing to
the wonder of it) but for that she cares
not; all her care being onely for some
to hear her talk (whom she must hire
shortly, none certainly else would under|go
the noice and vexation) mean time
an engine with so constant a motion as
her tongue would be far better than any
murmuring Fountain, or purling Brook
to make one sleep, and she wants onely
the faculty of talking in her sleep herself,
to make the perpetuall motion with her
tongue.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a Taciturne Person.</HEAD>
<P>HE is the contrary Extremity, and
knows as little to speak as t'other

head was a talkative one to his;
and there is nothing so phlegmatique as
his discourse; you might have patience
as well to tend a <HI>Still,</HI> that drops but once
a quarter, as to attend his speech; the
counting whose words, and a <HI>Dutch</HI> clock
is an Excercise much alike: The wheels

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a School of young Gentlewomen.</HEAD>
<P>TO shew how many degrees they are
removed from, <HI>Court</HI> breeding their
<HI>Schools</HI> most commonly are erected in
some <HI>Country</HI> Village nigh the <HI>Town,</HI>
where to save charges (like that country
parish that would not go to cost of true
<HI>Orthography</HI> in painting the Ten Com|mandments)
they have the worst Masters
can be got, for <HI>love</HI> or <HI>money;</HI> learning to
quaver instead of <HI>singing, hop</HI> instead of
<HI>dancing,</HI> and rake the <HI>Ghitar,</HI> rumble the
<HI>Virginals,</HI> and scratch and thrumb the
<HI>Lute,</HI> instead of playing neatly and
handsomely. And for their languages a
<HI>Magpy</HI> in a moneth would chatter more,
than they learn in a year: nor are their
manners and behaviour much better,
both so unfashionable and rude, (or ram|ping
and hoiting, or mincing and bri|dling
it, as their reverend <HI>Mistresse</HI> is
<HI>libertine</HI> or <HI>precise;</HI>) as their unlearning
<PB N="45" REF="27">
them costs their Parents (commonly)
more than their learning did. As for
their work (which they most glory in)
you have frequent <HI>examplers</HI> of it, how
some one or other (ordinarily) makes
such <HI>work</HI> with them, as the stitches can
never be pickt out again, without the
<HI>Mid-wives</HI> help: No sweet-meat shops
being ever so haunted with <HI>Wasps</HI> and
<HI>Flys</HI> as these <HI>Schools</HI> by all the <HI>wild-youth</HI>
about the Town. Mean time, I'le not say
their grave Mistresse is a <HI>Bawd</HI> (who
thinks her self a very <HI>Debora</HI> for govern|ment)
but certainly her <HI>Simplicity</HI> is
little lesse; first, gives admittance, then
opportunity to such vermine as these in|to
their <HI>Bouroughs,</HI> who when they get
their heads in once, all the Body natu|rally
follows. To conclude, they learn
nothing there befitting <HI>Gentlewomen,</HI> but
onely to be so <HI>gentle</HI> at last, as commonly
they run away with the first <HI>Serving-man</HI>
or younger Brother makes <HI>love</HI> unto
them: when their <HI>Parents</HI> finde (to their
cost) that all their cost was cast away,
and their <HI>Husbands</HI> after a while find too,
<PB N="47" REF="28">
how to that old saying of choosing a

words; and that the <HI>Courtier</HI> uses, to <HI>bob</HI> of
suiters, or <HI>bob</HI> for those they are suiters
too: In a word, tis the language of the
<HI>Idle</HI> for to delight the <HI>vain,</HI> and but
<PB N="133" REF="74">
a speaking <HI>ceremony,</HI> as <HI>ceremony</HI> is but a
dumb <HI>complement;</HI> whence our new re|formers
hate it so much perhaps, as they
have chang'd the stile into as much de|fect
of Civility, as tother was in the ex|cesse,
they being faln now upon such a
vain of <HI>clownishness</HI> (or I may say) not
<HI>bluntnesse,</HI> but <HI>churlishnesse,</HI> not of plain
<HI>dealing,</HI> but of plain <HI>divillishness,</HI> as if they
hold on as they begin, pray <HI>God</HI> we do
not wish for our complimenting dayes a|gain,
as far the better extremity of the

<HEAD>CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a young Enamourist.</HEAD>
<P>He's one who as soon as he has quited
his School-boyes <HI>Toyes,</HI> next <HI>Toy</HI> he
gets is a <HI>Mrs</HI> when t'would make you
forswear <HI>Love</HI> to see how ridiculously
he makes it, and to hear him talk of <HI>Gods</HI>
and <HI>Goddesses,</HI> you would take him for
some <HI>Pagan</HI> never converted to <HI>Christia|nity.</HI>
There is nothing so <HI>cold</HI> as to hear
him talk of Flames, nor so <HI>dull</HI> as his dis|coursing
of <HI>Cupids</HI> darts, and to hear him
<HI>sigh</HI> like a dry <HI>Pump,</HI> or broken <HI>winded
bellows;</HI> you would neer wonder at <HI>Lap|land
Witches</HI> affording winds so cheap.
Of all servants he is the necessariest and
easiest to content and feed, for he is his
Mrs. <HI>Squire, Dispenser, Laquey</HI> or <HI>Messenger,</HI>
but above all her <HI>Fool,</HI> to which he is
bound, by the proverb; <HI>Tis impossible to
love and to be wise:</HI> Mean time, you may
feed him cheaper than a <HI>Chamelion,</HI> for
<PB N="125" REF="75">
a good look serves him a week at least,
and he is prouder of holding his Mrs.
<HI>Busque</HI> or <HI>Fan,</HI> than a <HI>School Boy</HI> with a
Scepter in his hand, playing the <HI>Emperors</HI>
part ith School; to keep him to which,
his Mrs. lets him know that tis with <HI>Love</HI>
as tis with <HI>War,</HI> which once declared you
are to expect nothing but <HI>Hostility;</HI> and
knows her self, that tis with Lovers as tis
with <HI>Anglers,</HI> who feed the Fish ere they
are caught, but caught once feed on
them: Whence she bites not greedily at
the bait, but craftily tolls him on with
<HI>hopes,</HI> &amp; like <HI>Rope makers</HI> gos backwards
still, the better to advance her work, and
draw him on, mean while he follows her
so long, till either he wax weary and cea|ses
his persuit, or catches her tripping,
and then fals down on her, when fasten|ing
her in the marriage nooz, he carries
her away, and either turns kind <HI>Cuckold,</HI>
and keeps open house for all, or jealous
<HI>Coxcomb</HI> and shuts his doores against e|very
one.</P>
