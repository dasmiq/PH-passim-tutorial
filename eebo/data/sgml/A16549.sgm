<P>The words are spoken by Christ: as it is apparent vers. 8. Now Christ is truth: <HI>Ergo,</HI> this prophesie cannot be false. That which hee foretold touching <HI>Hierusalem</HI> in this Chapter, is in euery particular come to passe: why then should this prophesie be thought vntrue, concerning the worlds destruction, when as that other was true concer|ning <HI>Hierusalems</HI> desolation?</P>
<P><HI>Zachary</HI> foretold that the Messias in his first comming should in meekenesse ride vpon an asse, and, as S. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 21.4.</NOTE> <HI>Mat|thew</HI> reports, all that was done: behold here a greater than <HI>Zachary</HI> tels vs that the Messias in his second com|ming shall ride vpon the clouds: and shall we doubt of his word, who is that eternall Word? shall wee beleeue <HI>Zachary,</HI> who was but one of the small Prophets, and

<P>But because men will not beleeue him vpon his bare word, who made all the world with his word: Psal. 33.9. <HI>He spake, and it was done:</HI> he doth vse an oth and earnest asseueration in the 32. verse, <HI>Verily, I say vnto you.</HI> &amp;c.

This exposi|tion I take to be both pertinent and profitable, because Christ in this Chapter had foretold, that his Disciples should be persecuted and brought before Kings and Princes for prosessing his Gospell, verse 12. Yet this ge|neration shall not passe, but there shall be a Church al|way to confesse the faith in despight of the Diuell. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Origen. &amp; A|quin. caten. in Matth.</HI> 24.</NOTE> The Church one day shall passe too, but not till these things be done, then in the end it shall inherit a better posses|sion in Gods owne kingdome without end.</P>

<P>Secondly, Christs comming to iudgement is shewed heere by wonders in heauen, in earth, and in the sea, which shall be like harbingers of that dreadfull and ter|rible day: <HI>There shall be signes in the Sunne, and in the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one, and in the earth: the people shall be at their wits end through despaire: the sea and the water shall rore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

I purpose not in particular to discusse any curious question, but only to note in generall, that these wonders in heauen, and extra|ordinarie troubles on earth, are manifest forerunners of the worlds ruine; that as we know Summer is neere when the trees bud, so when we see these things come to passe, we may be sure that the kingdome of God is nigh: for as a man that is dying hath many phantasies, euen so, saith <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> the world declining shall haue manifold er|rors, in so much if it were possible Gods elect should be deceiued.

<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> could not conceiue the world should haue an end, because he thought and taught it had no begin|ning: but diuine <HI>Plato</HI> who liued in Egypt, and read (as it is <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iustin.

For as we reade in scripture, Some things haue a beginning, but no end, as Angels, and the soules of men.</P>
<P>Some things haue no beginning, but yet haue an end, as Gods eternall decrees.</P>
<P>One thing, to wit, <HI>Ens Entium,</HI> Almighty God, hath neither beginning nor end: <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.16.</NOTE> who only hath immorta|litie of all other things: the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Apocal.</HI> 1.8.</NOTE> first and the last: and yet in himselfe there is neither first nor last.</P>

<P>The very soule of all the Bible is the Gospell: and the summe of all the Gospell is the Creede: and the maine point of all the Creed is that article concerning our re|surrection and hope of eternall glorie, when Christ shall appeare.

<P>But albeit Preachers are seruants, yet are they not meane, but high stewards: and this is an exceeding great dignitie to be Christs mouth, Christs voice, Christs mes|sengers, Christs angels, in so much as <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 10.40.</NOTE> <HI>he that receiueth them, receiueth him, and he that despiseth them, despiseth him,</HI> as ambassadours <HI>speaking from him, and for him,</HI> as our Apostle <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.20.</NOTE> elsewhere.

<P>They are the mouth of God in preaching to the peo|ple, and againe the peoples mouth in praying to God; euen mediators as it were betweene God a man: as
<PB N="40" REF="23">
<HI>Moses</HI> said of himselfe, Deut. 5. <HI>I stood betweene the Lord and you, to declare vnto you the word of the Lord.</HI> This doth intimate how wee should teach, and you should heare. First how wee should preach: <HI>If any man speake, let him talke as the words of God.</HI> 1. Pet. 4.11.</P>
<P>It is a good obseruation, that the Lawyer ought to be|gin with reason, and so descend to common experience and authoritie. The Physician he must begin with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pe|rience, and so come to reason and authoritie: but the Di|uine must begin with authoritie, and so proceed to rea|son and experience.</P>
<P N="2">2. This may teach you to heare our voyce; <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.13.</NOTE> not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the word of God. Christ said of the wicked Pharisies in the 23. of S. Matth. <HI>Quae dicunt, facite</HI>: Doe as they say, but not as they doe: <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>August. contra literas Petilian. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>Dicunt enim quae Dei sunt, faciunt quae sua sunt</HI>: They doe their owne workes, but speake the Lords word. And therfore so long as the Preachers deliuer the wholesome words of our Lord Iesus, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.3.</NOTE> or doctrine which is accor|ding to his words, you must entertaine them as Angels of God, euen as Christ Iesus; honouring their place and re|uerencing their persons. And this I take to be the pith of the first part.</P>
<P>In the second, S. <HI>Paul</HI> teacheth how wee must not iudge: first he reports, then reproues their fault. His re|port is in these words: <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hieron. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>H&icirc;c iam quaeritur</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Erasmus in loc.</HI></NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>non</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">: <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aquin. &amp; Gorran. in loc.</HI></NOTE> Heere among you Corinthians it is discussed and disputed who is a faithful Minister, &amp; who is vnfaithfull.</P>
<P>And herein they wrong both God, his word, and his Ministers: God, to whom onely iudgement belongs in this case. Some peraduenture may iudge of the Ministers eloquence; many of his industrie, but none of his faith|fulnesse: which is the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 24.45.</NOTE> chiefe thing required in a ste|ward. A man may be fruitfull and yet not faithfull; an instrument to saue other, and yet be condemned himself: for he may preach Christ not for Christ, but happely for other respects: as the fornicator makes delectation his
<PB N="41" REF="23">
end, not generation; so the Preacher, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.2.</NOTE> <HI>adulterans ver|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m,</HI> as it is in the vulgar, intends not to get children in Christ vnto God, but gaine, or glorie to himselfe. Ye know the men, ye know not their minde: ye see their fact, not their faith; onely God knowes the secrets of all hearts.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is an iniurie to Gods word, in hauing the faith of our glorious Lord Iesus Christ in respect of per|sons, <HI>Iames</HI> 2.1. It is not any who, who may either priui|ledge an error, or preiudice a truth: if another Gospell, hold him accursed, although the Minister be an Angell: if a truth, doe as they say, though the teacher be a diuell: poyson in a golden cup is as hurtfull as in an earthen pot: wine in a siluer bowle no better then in a woodden dish. When one faith, <HI>I am Pauls, and another I am Apollos, are ye not</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.4.</NOTE> <HI>carnall</HI>? Is not this grosse carnalitie, to set vp I|dols in the Church, and to worship them in stead of God?</P>
<P>Thirdly, this is an indignitie to the Preachers, in that artles men will take vpon them to iudge of art. By the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pou tons A|bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gement, title, Brewer and Butcher.</HI></NOTE> lawes of the land, a person occupying the craft of a But|cher, may not vse the occupation of a Tanner; and a Brewer may not deale in the occupation of a Cooper: <HI>Quod medicorum est promittunt medici, tractant fabrilia fabri.</HI> None prescribe physick but such as are Doctors, at least practitioners in the facultie: none plead at the com|mon barre, but such as are learned in the law: yet euerie one, as <HI>Hierome</HI> complaines in an Epistle to <HI>Paulinus,</HI> takes vpon him exact knowledge in Theologie, and will teach both Clerke and Priest what they should say, what they should doe. So that often it fareth with Preachers, as it doth alway with fish, none so welcome as new come: If a stranger happely come among vs, albeit he be neuer so weake for his learning, neuer so wicked for his liuing; yet all the countrie must gad after him, and neglect their owne pastors: <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 13.57.</NOTE> as Christ in the Gospell, <HI>A Prophet is not honoured in his owne citie, and in his owne house.</HI> This
<PB N="42" REF="24">
was a soule fault in Corinth: <HI>Apollos,</HI> and <HI>Cephas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> were despised, while false teachers were deified. In|deed <HI>Paul</HI> writes in the third chapter of this Epistle, as if some followed him, and other <HI>Apollos</HI>: himselfe for his plaine doctrine, and <HI>Apollos</HI> for his excellent eloquence. But in the sixth verse of this chapter hee saith, he applied those things vnto himselfe, and <HI>Apollos</HI> figuratiuely; <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aquin. in loc.</HI></NOTE> meaning that <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Apollos</HI> and himselfe were neglected, and other vpstart seducers only rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded: he did vse the names of Gods Apostles in his censure for the benefit of the Corinthians: For your sake, that ye might learne by vs that no man presume aboue that which is written, and that one swell not against another for any mans cause.</P>
<P>So men in our daies are too partiall in hearing and censuring their Teachers: as one said, Auditories are like Faires; the Pedler and the Balladmonger hath more co~pany then the graue rich Merchant: Children &amp; fooles hang vpon them who sell toyes, and neglect those who haue their shops stuft with good commodities: and this assuredly doth discourage many Pastors learned and pro|fitable. For euery man hath not a magnanimous spirit, <HI>spernere se sperni,</HI> to tell his auditorie with <HI>Paul, I passe ve|ry little to be iudged of you.</HI> For so this fault is reproued in the third verse.</P>
<P>The false teachers had extolled themselues and disgra|ced him; affirming <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.10.</NOTE> that <HI>his bodily presence was weake, and his speech of no value.</HI> S. <HI>Paul</HI> therfore hauing the testimo|nie of a good conscience, resolutely tels the Corinthians, <HI>I little passe to be iudged of them, or you, or any man:</HI> Hee <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Marlorat ex Martyr. in loc.</HI></NOTE> saith not, I esteeme not at all; but I little regard: that is, not so much respect your iudgement, as that I should be discouraged in doing my dutie. The witnesse of con|science is more comfortable then the vulgar breath: in comparison of the one, I little prise the other. Or as <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>In loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Gorran</HI>: It were a great thing to be iudged of such as are spirituall; but it is a very small thing to be iudged of

<P><HI>Either of mans iudgement.</HI>] Our Apostle wils vs to re|buke with all long suffering and doctrine. Now himselfe is a paterne of his owne precept: for left he should seeme too bitter in chiding the Corinthians, and despising their iudgement; he doth in this clause somewhat qualifie his speech, insinuating that he doth except against all others iudgement, so well as theirs. Happely some will obiect it is vnciuill and vnchristian, not to regard what men speake of vs: As wee must haue care of our conscience, so likewise of our credit:</P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ouid.</HI></NOTE>Qu&acirc; semel amiss&acirc; poste&agrave; nullus eris.</L></Q>
<P>It is good in our courses to gaine the fore-game; for it is exceeding hard to play an after-game of reputation.

<P>I answere to the first: If <HI>Zacharie</HI> was a Priest, then a sinner: for as we reade, Heb. 7.27. the Priests manner was
<PB N="45" REF="25">
first to offer sacrifice for his owne sinnes, and then for the peoples. If then <HI>Zacharie</HI> did sacrifice, he had sinne, and sinne is a transgression of the Law: so that he did not ex|actly keepe the whole law, but himselfe and his wife so farre obserued the commandements as that they were blamelesse in the worlds eye: <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bacer. &amp; Be|za in loc.</HI></NOTE> no man could iustly con|demne them for doing vniustly.</P>
<P>But, as <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Confess. lib.</HI> 9. <HI>cap.</HI> 13.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine</HI> said, <HI>Vae etiam laudabili vitae homi|num, si remota misericordia discutias eam</HI>: Woe to the commendable life of man, if God set mercie aside in iudging of it.</P>

<P>For the commendation of <HI>Iob,</HI> it is not simple but com|paratiue: There was none like him on the earth; at least none so righteous in that part of the earth in the land of Vz. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gregor.

<P>Now for <HI>Dauid,</HI> his praise was not generall, but parti|cular and partiall. There was no wickednesse found in him, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Euthymius in loc.</HI></NOTE> that is, no plot or practise against <HI>Saul</HI>; wherof he was accused vniustly: but otherwise in other things, his sinnes were so many, and those so heauie, that hee crieth out in the 38. Psalme, <HI>Put me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine
<PB N="46" REF="26">
anger,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Dauid</HI> was no traitor, but <HI>Dauid</HI> was an adul|terer, and a cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll murtherer: <HI>He turned from nothing the Lord commanded him all the daies of his life, saue only in the matter of Vriah the Hittite.</HI> 1.

<P>What, had <HI>Dauid</HI> no fault else, but only that against <HI>Vriah?</HI> Yes surely, <HI>Dauid</HI> was <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</HI> 51.5.</NOTE> <HI>conceiued in sin, and sha|pen in wickednesse.</HI> As he was the sonne of many yeares, so the father of many sinnes. In his priuate conuersation hee did so much offend, as that he saith in the 130 Psalme, <HI>If thou O Lord be extreame to marke what is done amisse, oh Lord who may abide it</HI>? That text then is to be construed of his publike gouernment, as the circumstances import; as he was a King, the Scripture giueth him this commen|dation, that, excepting the matter of <HI>Vriah,</HI> hee gaue no publike scandall in the whole time of his raigne. <HI>Dauid</HI> was in many things a bad man, but in most things a good King.</P>
<P>So likewise this speech of <HI>Paul: I know nothing by my selfe,</HI> is not <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> loc.</HI></NOTE> generall, extended to the whole course of his life, but particular touching his Apostleship.

Christ, that he was not worthie to loose the latchet of his shoe: and Christ here commends highly both the carri|age and calling of <HI>Iohn</HI>; affirming of the one, that hee was not an inconstant or vaine man; of the other, that he was a Prophet and more then a Prophet. There are three kindes of Prophets according to the threefold distincti|on of time: some write of things past, as <HI>Moses</HI>: In the beginning God created, &amp;c. penning an <HI>hexameron</HI> ma|ny yeares after the world was made: some of things to come, so Christ was foretold by the <HI>mouth of all his holy Prophets euer since the world began</HI>: some of things pre|sent, as <HI>Zacharias</HI> in his song: <HI>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his people:</HI> Christ being then conceiued had begun his visitation; and such a Prophet was olde <HI>Simeon</HI> at Christs circumcision: <HI>Mine eyes haue seene thy saluation.</HI> Now <HI>Iohn</HI> is more then any of these, because he is all these; prophesying of things past: <HI>I am the voice of him that crieth in the wilder|nes,</HI> opening an olde text of <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 40.3.</NOTE> <HI>Esay</HI>; prophesying of things present: <HI>Behold the lambe of God&punc; that taketh away the sinnes of the world</HI>; prophesying of things to come, <HI>Repent, for the kingdome of God is at hand.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Iohn</HI> is more then a Prophet; for whereas other prophesied onely in their life; <HI>Iohn</HI> was a prophet in his mothers bellie before hee was borne: for <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 1.41.</NOTE> when <HI>Elizabeth</HI> heard the salutation of <HI>Mary,</HI> the babe sprang in her wombe, the which was so sensible a prophesie, that <HI>Elizabeth</HI> instantly called <HI>Mary</HI> the mother of our Lord.</P>

<BIBL>The Gospel. IOHN 1.19.</BIBL>
<Q>This is the record of Iohn, When the Iewes sent Priests and Leuites from Ierusalem to aske him, What art thou?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Gospell is a dialogue betweene certaine Priests and <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist. The Priests inquire after his person and place, cariage and calling. Their interrogato|ries are fiue: the which are answered by S. <HI>Iohn</HI> seuerally; shewing, and that directly, both what he was not, as also what he was; not Christ, not <HI>Elias,</HI> not the Prophet; but the voice of a Crier in the wildernesse.</P>
<P>The first question is, <HI>Who art thou?</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Diez conc.</HI> 1. <HI>Dom.</HI> 3. <HI>Aduent.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Quis ego sum?</HI> is the question of a good man? <HI>Tu quis es?</HI> of an enuious.

And albeit <HI>Euth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mius</HI> is of opinion, that the Iewes here|in malitiously disabled their knowledge: yet it is more probable that they made this question, to see whether he was Christ. For as we read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Luke 3.15. All men mused in their hearts of <HI>Iohn,</HI> if he were not the Christ: and our <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 5.35.</NOTE> Sauiour told the Iewes plainly, that they for a time re|ioiced more in <HI>Iohn,</HI> who was but a candle, then in him|selfe who was the Sunne of righteousnesse, and light of the world: and albeit these messengers vttered not so much in word, yet assuredly they harboured such a con|ceit
<PB N="66" REF="36">

<P>In which answere, obserue the matter and the man|ner.

<P>But the maner of his confession exceeds far the mat|ter: <HI>hee confessed and denied not, and said plainly, I am not Christ.</HI> The which words are not superfluous and idle, for euery tittle of the Scriptures hath his worth and weight. Such repetitions are vsuall in the Bible, to set out things more fully, as <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccles.</HI> 1.2.</NOTE> <HI>vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cant.</HI> 6.12.</NOTE> <HI>Returne, returne, O Shulamite returne, returne.</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierem.</HI> 22.29.</NOTE> <HI>O earth, earth, earth, heare the word of the Lord.</HI> By this iteration then of one and the same thing, S. <HI>Iohn</HI> shewed how vnwilling hee was to rob Christ of that honour, which onely belong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d vnto him. When <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 10.26.</NOTE> <HI>Cornelius</HI> fell downe at <HI>Peters</HI> feet, and would haue worshipped him, <HI>Peter</HI> instantly tooke him vp, saying; <HI>Stand vp, for euen I my selfe am a man.</HI> When the men of <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 14.15.</NOTE> Lystra would haue sacrificed vnto <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Barnabas</HI>; they rent their clothes, and ran in am&oacute;g the people, crying, <HI>We are euen men, sub|iect to the like passions that yee be.</HI> When that other <HI>Iohn</HI>

Giue then to the cru|cifix the respect due to the crucifix, reseruing to the cru|cified that honour which onely belongs to the crucified.</P>
<P>If a man should aske the bread in the Sacrament, What art thou? it would answere plainly with <HI>Iohn,</HI> in such lan|guage as it can, I am not the Christ; approuing it selfe to our sight and taste, that it is a morsell of bread, a creature, not a Creator, &amp; therefore not to be worshipped &amp; ado|red as God.

<P>The second question is; <HI>Art thou Elias?</HI> To which <HI>Iohn</HI> answers, No. Yet <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 11.14.</NOTE> Christ saith, he is that <HI>Elias.</HI> An <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>August. tract</HI> 4. <HI>in Iohan. &amp; Greg. hom.</HI> 7. <HI>in Euangel.</HI></NOTE> An|gel from heauen hath answered this obiection, Luk. 1.17. <HI>Iohn</HI> Baptist is <HI>Elias</HI> in power, not in person, indued with the like temperance, like wisdome, like courage.

<P>The word of God is a proclamation in writing, com|mon to all, and the Minister is the voice of the Crier to giue notice to the people, that the matter of the procla|mation concerneth them and euery one of them: Acts 13.26. <HI>Men and brethren, and whosoeuer among you feareth God, to you is the word of this saluatio~ sent: To</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 3.26.</NOTE> <HI>you God rai|sed vp his Sonne Iesus, and hath sent him to blesse you by tur|ning euery one of you from your iniquities.</HI></P>
<P>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth spea|keth: A Preacher therefore must cry from the bottome of his heart: the which is prefigured <HI>Ezekiel</HI> 3.1. <HI>Sonne of man, eat this roll, and goe and speake vnto the house of Israel.</HI> Vtter nothing to the people, but that which thou hast first digested thy selfe.</P>
<P><HI>The voice</HI>] A word is first conceiued in the heart: then vttered by the voice; yet we heare the voice before wee know the word: so Christ the eternall Word was before <HI>Iohn,</HI> and all other Preachers. <HI>In the beginning was the Word,</HI> and that beginning was before all beginning: yet the world knew not the Word, till it was preached by the voice of men and Angels: albeit the word in it selfe be before the voice, yet vnto vs the voice goeth before the

word: <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 1.15.</NOTE> <HI>He that commeth after me was before me.</HI> Christ then is the Word; and euery Preacher of Christ is a voice; the which one word confounds all such as being called thereunto, doe neglect their dutie of preaching. In euery voice, specially a Church voice, three commendable qualities are required; that it bee cleere, sweete, and high.</P>
<P>Cleere: for as <HI>Hierome</HI> said, <HI>Omnia in sacerdote debent esse vocalia:</HI> All things in a Diuine should preach: his ap|parell preach, his diet preach, his whole life preach: <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.12.</NOTE> <HI>An example in word, in conuersation, in spirit, in faith, in pure|nesse.</HI> Such a voice was the Baptist; his preaching was of repentance, and he liued as a penitent: as he did bold|ly speake the truth, so constantly suffer for the truth: on the contrarie, bad manners and false doctrine make harsh and hoarse the loud voice.</P>
<P>Couetous <HI>Iudas</HI> had an hoarse voyce: filthie <HI>Nicolaes</HI> an hoarse voyce: <HI>Simon Magus</HI> an hoarse voyce: <HI>Peter</HI> in denying his Master, through extreame coldnesse of feare, had an hoarse voyce too for a time. <HI>Manicheus, A|rius, Pelagius,</HI> all Hereticall, Schismaticall, Atheisticall teachers are hoarse voyces in Gods quier.</P>
<P><HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le solus praedicat viua voce, quipraedicat vita &amp; voce.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, the Church voice must be sweet: euery seed is not to be sowen at euery season, in euery ground: and so it is in Gods husbandrie: The voyce therefore must <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.15.</NOTE> aright diuide the word which it sings and saies; obser|uing time, and keeping it selfe in tune, speaking to the proud boldly, to the meeke mildly, to all wisely.

Tim. 4. without any iarre or false stroke sweetly. Such a voyce was <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist, rebuking <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 3.19.</NOTE> <HI>Herod,</HI> hardened in his wickednes, rufly; ta|king

<P>And such a voyce was the Baptist also. First for the mat|ter, he reached many streines neuer sung before: Repent, saith he, for the kingdom of heauen is at hand. This note was neuer heard of the people, nor sung by the Priests in old time. <HI>Iohn</HI> being more then a Prophet, exalted his voyce aboue the Prophets, and in a plaine song, with|out any crotchets, preached him who is higher then the highest.</P>

<P>Sinners are farre off from God, and exceeding deafe: and therfore we must be angrie crying aloud, and lifting vp our voyce like a <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Esay</HI> 58.1.</NOTE> Trumpet, shewing the people their transgressions, and to the house of <HI>Iacob</HI> their sinnes.</P>
<P>First, sinners are farre off, as it is said of the <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 15.13.</NOTE> prodigall childe gone into a farre countrey, like <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Esay</HI> 53.6.</NOTE> lost sheep, straied out of Gods pastures into Satans inclosures: and therfore it is our office not onely to whistle, but also to crie: <HI>Re|turne, returne, &ocirc; Shulamite, returne, returne.</HI></P>
<P>God doth not goe from man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non tellus cym|ham&punc; te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">urem cymba relin|quit.</HI></NOTE> but man from God. He that saileth nigh a rocke, thinketh the rock runnes from the shippe, when as indeed the shippe rides, and the rock stands still: euen so we leaue the waies of the Lord, and runne our owne courses, and then wee complaine that God is farre from vs, and that our crie comes not nigh him. It is true that God is <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Prou.</HI> 15.29.</NOTE> farre off from the wicked, not
<PB N="72" REF="39">
because he is moueable, for hee is euer the same, but be|cause they bee wandring: yet they cannot flie from his <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 139.6. <HI>Vbinon est per gratiam, adest per vindictam. August. meditas. cap.</HI> 29.</NOTE> presence. The further from East the neerer vnto the West: the more they goe from Gods grace, the neerer his iustice: <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 119.155.</NOTE> saluation is far from the wicked, but iudge|men hangs ouer their heads. It is our dutie therefore to recall men, <HI>&agrave; Deo irato ad Deum placatum,</HI> from God as an angrie Iudge, to God as a mercifull Father. If we draw neere to God, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iam.</HI> 4.8.</NOTE> he will draw neere to vs: as the good father of the prodigall sonne, when hee perceiued him a farre off, he had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. It is said in the text, that the sonne did go to his father; but the father ran to meete his sonne. The fathers compassion and mercie, was greater then the sonnes passion and miserie.</P>
<P>Secondly, sinners are deafe, and therefore wee neede to crie aloud. Some will heare, but with one eare, like <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bilney to B. Tonstal, vti Fox Acts &amp; Mon. fol.</HI> 917.</NOTE> <HI>Malchus</HI> in the Gospell, hauing their right eare cut off, and only bringing their left eare to the sermon, mis|construing all things sinisterly: Some stop both their eares; like the deafe adder, refusing to heare the voice of the charmer, charme hee neuer so wisely: Psalme 58.5. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>In Psal.</HI> 57. <HI>Tom.</HI> 8. <HI>fol.</HI> 392.</NOTE> S. <HI>Augustine</HI> writing vpon those words, hath reported out of naturall Historiographers, that the serpent de|lighting in the darknesse, where withall he hath inclosed himselfe, claspeth one of his eares hard to the ground, and with his taile stoppeth the other, lest hearing the <HI>Marsus</HI> hee should be brought foorth to the light: so worldly men stop one eare with earth, that is, with coue|tousnesse; and the other with their taile, that is, hope of long life. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 22.29.</NOTE> <HI>Ieremie</HI> therfore crieth: <HI>O earth, earth, earth.</HI> O vnhappie caitiue, thou that hast nothing but earth in thy mouth, euer talking of worldly wealth: thou hast nothing but earth in thy minde, euer plotting how to ioyne house to house, and field to field; nothing but earth in thine hands, euer busied about the trifles of this life; heare the word of the Lord, which <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.17.18</NOTE> chargeth thee

<P>Thirdly, men speake aloud, when as they be angrie: so the Preacher ought to be zealous in the cause of God; euermore displeased with the sinnes of his people, saying with <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 139.21.</NOTE> <HI>Dauid</HI>; Doe not I hate them, O Lord, who hate thee? and am not I grieued with those that rise vp a|gainst thee?

the words of exhortation and doctrine: be moued at his crie, lest he despise your call. As he saith in the first of the Prouerbs: Because I haue called, and yee haue refused, I haue stretched out mine hand, and none would regard: therefore they shall call vpon me, but I will not answere: they shall seeke me earely, but they shall not finde me. Think on this all ye that forget God, ye that suffer Christ to stand and knock, and crie at the doore of your hearts, and yet ye will not let him in.</P>
<P><HI>In the wildernes</HI>] That is, in the world a desert of good|nes, wherein the Preacher must fight with beasts, as <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.32.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> at Ephesus in the shapes of men, crying vnto rauening wolues, couetous foxes, roaring lions, &amp;c. Here is the place where he must crie: for in heauen there is no crying, but all singing, and in hell there is no crying, to take heede of woe; but howling and crying for woe: while then you are in the <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 5.25.</NOTE> way, while it is called to <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 3.13.</NOTE> day, giue eare to the voice of the crier.</P>

The Preacher is the voice of a crier in the wil|dernes,
<PB N="75" REF="40">
not a carpet diuine for table Gospellers in a cor|ner. I will not any further examine the place, the end is all, and that is to make straight the way of the Lord.</P>
<P>The wicked walke either in circles, or else in ouer|twhart waies. <HI>Impij ambulant in circuitu,</HI> saith <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 12.6.</NOTE> <HI>Dauid,</HI> wearying themselues in the labyrinth of their vnruly de|sires; or if they walke not circularlie, they walke in wrie waies and by-waies opposite to the Lords way: for ex|ample; The vaine glorious doe all their good workes to be <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 7.1.5.</NOTE> seene of men, and so they crosse Gods way tending to another end; onely the children of God walke in the straight way, in a right line beginning and ending in God; as euery good gift is from him, so it is by them re|ferred vnto him; as his is the power, so his is the praise.</P>
<P>The end of our preaching is not to make way for our selues &amp; our own preferment, but for our Master and his glorie: Make streight the way of the Lord, as saith the Prophet <HI>Esay.</HI> Wherefore leauing all other expositions, I come to the Prophets interpretation, as it is recorded in his 40.

Euery valley shall be exalted, and euery mountaine and hill shall be made lowe: and the crooked shall bee straight, and the rough places plaine.</HI></P>
<P>Now these things are to be construed in a <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hyperius in loc. Esaiae.</HI></NOTE> spirituall sense.

Presumption and pride make mountaines and hils in Christs way; desperation holes in Christs way; vaine|glorie makes crooked the way: couetous cares are briers and bushes in the way; noisome lust makes foule the way: wherefore the voice of the crier in the wildernes must dig downe the mountaines, exalt the valleis, stub

<P>Now the Ward, during the time of his minority, suf|fers much bondage; differing, saith <HI>Paul,</HI> nothing from a seruant; nothing in respect of any present possession, or actuall administration of his owne estate, but very much in respect of his right and proprietie, being <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gorran. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>dominus ha|bitu, non vsu</HI>: as hauing <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Termes of the law. pag. 103.</NOTE> free hold in law, though as yet

<P>The law when it is in his principall vse, cannot iustifie, but accuse, terrifie, condemne. Now these are things of the world, which because it is the kingdome of the di|uell, is nothing else but a puddle of sinne, death, hell, and of all euill: and so the whole law, especially the ceremo|niall, are <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 4.9.</NOTE> beggerly rudiments of the world.</P>
<P>I speake not this to disgrace the law, neither doth <HI>Paul</HI> so meane; for it is holy, righteous, spirituall, diuine: but because <HI>Paul</HI> is in the matter of iustification, it is, as <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vbi supra.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lu|ther</HI> obserues, exceeding necessary, that he should speake of the law as of a very contemptible thing.

<P>In the ciuill life <HI>Moses</HI> and Christ agree: for our Sa|uiour said, <HI>he came not to destroy, but to</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 5.17.</NOTE> <HI>fulfill the law</HI>; but in the spirituall life, the one cannot abide the other: for <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 3.11.</NOTE> <HI>no man is iustified by the la; but the iust shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ue by faith.</HI> And therefore when Christ is presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the law must de|part out of the conscience, and leaue the <HI>bed, which is so</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Esay</HI> 28.20.</NOTE> <HI>strait that it cannot hold two,</HI> to Christ alone. Let him onely raigne in righteousnesse, in peace, ioy, life, that the soule may sleepe and repose it selfe in the multitude of his mercies sweetly without any terror of the law, sinne, death, hell. And thus you see the law tyranniseth ouer our consciences, as the cruell tutor doth ouer his vnfortu|nate Ward, till God in fulnesse of time giueth vs free|dome by Christ.</P>

<P>First, our sacrifice must be sound and quick; not blind, not lame, not seeble, Malach. 1.8. Wee must not offer to the diuell our youthfull yeares, and lay our old bones vp|on Gods altar: his sacrifice must bee the fattest, and the fairest; he must haue both head and hinderparts: here|by signifying that we must remember our Creator in the daies of our nonage, so well as in the daies of our dotage: for if wee deferre our offering till the last houre, when sicknes the bailiffe of death hath arrested vs, and paine sicknes attendant dulled our senses; it cannot be called a quicke, but a sicke; not a liuing, but a dead offering. That our sacrifice therefore may bee quicke, let vs, I be|seech you, begin quickly to dedicate our selues vnto God.</P>

<P>In the Law beasts appointed for sacrifice were first slaine, and then offered; and that for two causes especial|ly: first, (as <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>In loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ambrose</HI> notes) to put the sacrificer in mind what hee deserued by sinne: namely, death: and second|ly, because those bloodie sacrifices were types of Christs death on the crosse, which is the propitiation for our sinnes. In like manner euery Christian sacrifice must bee dead to the world, that he may liue to God; <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Coloss.</HI> 3.5.</NOTE> mortify|ing his earthly members, and <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Galat.</HI> 5.24.</NOTE> crucifying his car|nall affections, that he may become a <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Galat.</HI> 6.15.</NOTE> new creature in Christ.</P>
<P>As death depriues a man of naturall life, so mortifica|tion destroyes the bodie of sinne, which is the sensuall life: <HI>Moriatur ergo ne moriatur, mutetur homo ne d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mne|tur:</HI> (quoth <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm.</HI> 141. <HI>de temp.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Augustine</HI>) We must die for a time in this life, lest wee die for euer in the next life.

<P>World vsed in the worse sense signifieth either the wicked men of the world; or else the vaine things of the world: the wicked men, as Ioh. 12.31. the diuell is ter|med <HI>the prince of the world,</HI> that is, of the wicked in the world, who make themselues his vassals, by yeelding to his temptations, according to that of <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 6.16.</NOTE> <HI>Paul: He is our ma|ster to whom we submit our selues as seruants.</HI> It is not Sa|tans power that hee doth thus dominere in the Church: for he was <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Apocal.</HI> 20.2.</NOTE> bound and <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Apocal.</HI> 12.9.</NOTE> cast out of the Church; but it is the weaknes and wickednes of men, who loose him and open the gate when he was shut out; admitting him as a lord of misrule, ruling and ouerruling those who are chil|dren of disobedience: Ephes. 2.2.</P>

<P>But Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> meaning is, that wee may not follow wicked men in their wickednesse, nor worldly men in their worldlinesse, nor good men but in that they are good: as hee saith elsewhere, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.1.</NOTE> <HI>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Christ</HI>: for as in imitation oratorie, there are two sorts of examples; one necessarie to be followed alwaies in all things; as <HI>Demosthenes</HI> among the Grecians, and <HI>Tully</HI> among the Latines; another to be followed in some things, and at some times, as Poets and Historiographers: Euen so there are two sorts of examples in Christian imi|tation: the one necessarie, which is Christ the way, the truth, and the life: <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bernard. ser.</HI> 2. <HI>in ascens.

<P>Againe, we may not conforme our selues according to the greatest: <HI>Ego &amp; rexmeus,</HI> is no good plea, when God shall reckon with vs at the last and dreadfull day. Some men are so much at other mens seruice, that they neglect altogether Gods seruice. That thou didst follow such a Lord, and humor such a Gentleman; that there were bet|ter men in the company, when thou diddest this villanie; that vanity will not goe for a currant excuse: when Al|mighty God shall come to iudgement, then scepters and sepulchers shall be all one; Princes and pesants shall bee fellowes.</P>
<P>As in Chesse play, so long as the game is in playing, all the men stand in their order, and are respected according to their place: first, the king; then, the queene; then, the bishops; after them, the knights; and last of all, the com|mon souldier: but when once the game is ended, and the table taken away, then all are confusedly tumbled into a
<PB N="115" REF="60">
bag, and happily the king is lowest, and the pawne vp|most. Euen so it is with vs in this life; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e world is a huge theater or stage, wherein some play the parts of Kings; other, of Bishops; some, Lords; many, Knights; other, Yeomen: but when our Lord shall come with his Angels to iudge the world, all are alike. For if great men and meane persons are in the same sinne, they shall be bound together, and cast as a fagot into hell fire. And therefore let vs not fashion our selues according to the wicked, whether Prince or people.</P>
<P>Secondly, we must not fashion our selues according to the vanities of the world, and that for two causes espe|ciallie.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because they be transitory: where note the worlds mortality.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because they be not satisfactory: where note the soules immortality.</P>
<P>For the first, all the things of this world are of such a fashion, as that either they will leaue vs, or else we must leaue them. They leaue vs; All <HI>riches haue their</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Prou.</HI> 23.5.</NOTE> <HI>wings, and make their flight like an Eagle.</HI> We leaue them; <HI>As the</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ier.</HI> 17.11.</NOTE> <HI>Partridge gathereth the young, which she hath not brought forth: so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leaue them in the midst of his daies, and at his end shall bee a foole.</HI></P>
<P>The Partridge, as <HI>Ambrose</HI> writes in his 48. Epistle, maketh a nest of egges, which she laied not; but so soone as the birds are hatched, the true mother cals them all away from the stepmother. So it is, saith <HI>Ieremy,</HI> with the couetous man, <HI>incubat auro,</HI> like a brood goose, or as an hen that sits; <HI>incubo</HI> (for so the Latines terme him) hee keepes his nest, and sits as it were brooding, but when his chickens are hatched, he heares a voice from heauen; <HI>O foole, this night will they fetch away thy soule from thee: and then, whose shall these things be which thou hast prouided?</HI> Indeed many men reputed him wise while he liued; but at his end, when by the finger of God, wee see that his
<PB N="116" REF="61">
goods are otherwise disposed, either excheated to the King, or restored to the true masters; or else by some small error in his will, caried away by those whom he neuer lo|ued: at his end, when euery Partridge shall call his young, then those that are wise, shall account him a very foole: <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 52.8.</NOTE> <HI>Lo this is the man that tooke not God for his strength, but trusted in the multitude of his vncertaine riches, and streng|thened himselfe in his wickednesse.</HI> And therefore loue not the world, neither the things of the world; for the world passeth away, and the lust thereof, being onely certaine, in being vncertaine.</P>
<P>Secondly, things of this world are not satisfactory, they doe not fill and content the mind of man. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccles.</HI> 1.8.</NOTE> The eye cannot be satisfied with seeing, nor the eare filled with hearing: all things haue an emptinesse and extreme va|nity, purchasing vnto the possessors nothing but anguish and vexation of spirit: and the reason hereof, as <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ludo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icus vi|ua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dus de veri|tate contritio|nis, fol.</HI> 87.</NOTE> <HI>Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aldus</HI> obserues, is, because the heart of man is made like a tri|angle, and the world round as a circle. Now a circle can|not fill a triangle, but there will be some corner empty.</P>
<P>There is nothing can fill the mind of man, but the bles|sed Trinitie, when God the Father, the most ancient of daies, shall fill our memory; God the Sonne, who is wis|dome it selfe, shall fill our vnderstanding; God the holy Ghost, who is contentation and loue, shall sit in our will; then all the powers of our mind will be at rest, when as they shall inioy him who made them. But the things of this world afford no perfect and absolute contentment; and therefore, <HI>ne vos configurate seculo isto,</HI> fit not your selues according to the worlds figure, which is a circle; but be ye renewed in your mind, which is a triangle, re|presenting the sacred Trinitie.</P>

<P>The Creede is necessarie for faith; as teaching vs what wee haue to beleeue. The Pater noster is necessarie for hope; teaching vs what we are to desire.

<P>First, Christ is to be found on the third day: vers 46. <HI>It came to passe three daies after, that they found him in the Temple.</HI> The first day was the time before the law, in which, as <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 10.24.</NOTE> Christ told his Apostles, all the Patriarks and holy fathers desired to see the things which they saw, and could not see them; and to heare the things which they heard, and could not heare them.</P>
<P>The second day was the time vnder the law, when also the Priests and Prophets expected Christ, but they could not finde him: therefore the Prophet <HI>Esay</HI> crieth out in his 64. Chapter, <HI>Oh that thou wouldest bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke the heauens and come downe.</HI></P>

<Q>Seeing that we haue diuers gifts according to the grace that is giuen vnto vs, &amp;c.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Postil. maior. dom.</HI> 2. <HI>ab Epi|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an.</HI></NOTE> <HI>LVther</HI> is of opinion, that this Epistle should be <HI>ca|pite breuior, &amp; sine prolixior</HI>; shorter in the begin|ning, longer at the end. For the beginning appertaines vnto the conclusion of the Epistle for Sunday before; and the end to be the beginning of the Epistle for Sun|day following: yet so, that it may be both read and ex|pounded, as a text absolute in it selfe. The summe where|of is, that wee must imploy and improue the manifold gifts of God vnto the glory of his name, and good of his people.</P>
<P>This exhortation is inferred vpon a familiar compari|son vsed in the words immediatly before: for <HI>as we haue many members in one body, and all members haue not one of|fice; so we being many, are one body in Christ, and euery man among our selues, one anothers members.</HI> In which, obserue foure instructions.</P>
<P>First, as the members are not made by their owne ver|tue, but created by Gods almighty power, before they could execute any function in the body; not members because working, but on the contrary, working because members: In like sort, Christians are not members of Christ through their owne good works, but they doe good works because they be members, and inserted in|to Christ: as the tree brings forth the fruit, and not the fruit the tree. The Papists then in their works of congrui|tie, run too much vpon the figure called <GAP DESC="foreign">; set|ting the cart before the horse; merit before mercy. <HI>Potes &agrave; te de ficere</HI> (saith <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>In Psal.</HI> 94.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine) sed teipsum reficere non potes; ille reficit, qui te fecit.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, the members are well <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Zancbius in Ephes.</HI> 4.16.</NOTE> content with their
<PB N="131" REF="68">
seuerall offices and place; the foote is not grieued at the heads supremacie, neither doth the nose maligne the eye, nor eye couet to be tongue, but euery one performes his function without any faction: euen so we which are members of Christs mysticall body, must be content with our vocation and calling, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.20.</NOTE> neither enuying such as are a|boue, nor despising such are vnder vs. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.4.</NOTE> <HI>Although there be diuersities of gifts, yet but one spirit: diuersities of administra|tions, yet but one Lord: diuersities of operations, yet but one God, who worketh all in all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Are all Apostles? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? haue all the gift of healing? doe all speake with tongues? doe all interpret?</HI> It is God who worketh all in all; communicating indifferently spirituall life to all his members; insomuch as the least is a member of his bo|die so well as the greatest. In this respect all parts are peeres.</P>
<P>Albeit (I say) there be diuers gifts, and diuers measures of gifts, and so by consequence for fashion, and function an imparity; yet because they be <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sarcerius in loc.</HI></NOTE> donatiues, grants, and graces, as it is said here, the mighty may not scorne the meane, nor the meane enuie the mighty: no part must be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or.</HI> 4.7.</NOTE> <HI>For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat hast thou that thou hast not receiued?</HI> He that appointed thee mouth or eye, might haue made thee foote or hand.

If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</HI> But God hath in a most sweete order, disposed the members euery one of them in the body: <HI>first, Apostles; secondly, Prophets; thirdly, Teachers; then, workers of miracles; after that, the gifts of healing; helpers, gouernours, diuersities of tongues.</HI></P>
<P>Hee then that affects in the Church an hotchpotch paritie, martyrs and marres Christs body, which is,
<PB N="132" REF="69">
<GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. a body fitly knit together by euery ioynt: Ephesians 4.16.</P>

If then we doe not <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Galat.</HI> 6.2</NOTE> beare one anothers burthen, and feele one another miserie, wee are not knit together by the sinewes of loue; and if not knit to the bodie, no part of the bodie.</P>
<P>Fourthly, there is no dead or idle member in the body, but euery one helpes another, and is seruiceable for the good of the whole: the eye doth direct the head, and the hand guard the eye; the nose smels for all, tongue speaks for all, hand workes for all. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.21.25.</NOTE> <HI>The eye cannot say to the hand, I haue no need of thee; nor the hand againe to the feet, I haue no need of you: but euery part seekes anothers and not his owne good.</HI></P>

<P>Diuines haue rendred sundrie reasons, why Christ and his companie being inuited came to this wedding.</P>
<P>First (as our <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Com. Booke, tit.

<P>Thirdly, to certifie the spiritual mariage betweene the Church and himselfe: <HI>Seuerus Antiochenus orat.</HI> 119. <HI>vt citatur in Graec. caten. &amp; &agrave; Maldonat in loc.</HI></P>

<P>We cannot now feast Christ in his person; but we may feede him in his ministers, in his members. Inuite there|fore the good man, and the poore man; as <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iob</HI> 31.17.</NOTE> <HI>Iob</HI> saith, <HI>If I haue eaten my morsels alone, and the fatherlesse haue not eaten thereof.</HI> As <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Amos</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>Amos</HI> complained of the rich glut|tons in his time, <HI>deuouring the lambs of the flocke, and calues out of the stall; drinking wine in bowles, and anoynting them|selues with the chiefest oyntments, and singing to the viole: but no man</HI> (saith the Prophet) <HI>is sorrie for the affliction of Ioseph.</HI> If thou wilt feast Christ, inuite the Disciples, in|uite <HI>Mary,</HI> the fatherlesse, the widow: for hee protests openly; <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 25.40.</NOTE> <HI>whatsoeuer is done vnto the least of my brethren, is done vnto me.</HI></P>

Hereby teaching vs, that albeit in regard of our miserie, nothing can be said too much; yet in respect of Christs mercie, one word is enough, as being more willing to relieue then we to re|quest.</P>
<P>Lastly, this is a demonstration of her charitie; <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Zepper. con.</HI> 1. <HI>in loc.</HI></NOTE> being solicitous for her good friends, accou~ting their want her woe. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.26.</NOTE> For if one member of Christs mystical bodie suffer, all suffer with it: and therefore the good Virgin out of <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Caluin. in loc.</HI></NOTE> sympathie, perceiuing the wine would faile, cried vnto her sonne, <HI>they haue no wine.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="162" REF="84"><HI>Aleper</HI>] All weaknesse originally proceeds from <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 5.14.</NOTE> wic|kednesse; <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om.</HI> 3. <HI>part. quaest.</HI> 4. <HI>art.</HI> 4.</NOTE> either from some defect in our conception, or disorder in our conuersation: as <HI>Mephibos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth</HI> had <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 4.</NOTE> his lamenesse by falling from his nurse; so euery man his sick|nesse by falling from the Lord. Christ, who was free from sinne, was also free from sicknesse: but vnto men, carying about them bodies of sinne, diseases are as it were a <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hemingius in loc.</HI></NOTE> ser|mon from heauen, wherein Almighty God accuseth of sins, and shewes his wrath against sinners.</P>
<P>But the condition of a leper, as we reade in the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Leuit.</HI> 13.</NOTE> law, was of all other sicke, most insupportable. First, he must liue alone, separated from the fellowship of Gods peo|ple, as vnworthy to come into cleane company. Second|ly, he did weare foure markes to be knowne by; his gar|ments torne, his head bare, his mouth couered, and he must cry; I am vncleane, I am vncleane. For griefe where|of, assuredly some pined away; being forlorne in their sorrow, destitute of all good comfort and company. Yet this leper indued with a liuely faith, is not hopelesse, howsoeuer haplesse. For he comes, and saith vnto the great Physitian of the world; <HI>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane:</HI> though he knew that his sicknesse in the worlds eye was incurable, yet he did beleeue that vnto God nothing is impossible. He felt his owne misery to be great, yet hoped Christs mercy was more great: and therefore comes vnto him (as <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>De vit&aacute; Chri|sti. part.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 41.</NOTE> <HI>Ludolphus</HI> aptly) <HI>Non t&agrave;m passibus corporis qu&agrave;m fide cordis:</HI> If thou wilt, thou canst. A strong faith in a weake body.</P>
<P>Faith comes by <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 10.17.</NOTE> hearing&punc; and the reason why this le|per extraordinarily desired to heare Christ, and heare of Christ, was his vncleane disease: <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ferus ser.</HI> 4. <HI>in loc.</HI></NOTE> so that the weaknesse of his body, brought him vnto the Physitian of his soule. Note then here with <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28.</NOTE> <HI>Paul, that all things happen for the good of such as are good.</HI> It was good for <HI>Dauid</HI> that he was in trouble; good for <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>King.</HI> 5.</NOTE> <HI>Naaman</HI> that he was a leper; for his vncleannesse brought him vnto the Prophet, and the Prophet brought him vnto the sauing knowledge of

the true God. It was good for <HI>Paul</HI> that he was buffeted by Satan, for otherwise peraduenture through abun|dance of reuelations he would haue buffeted God.</P>
<P>Of all herbes in the garden (as one wittily) Rew is the herbe of grace. Many times our woe doth occasion our weale: for as pride doth breed sores of salues, so faith on the contrarie doth often make salues of sores, altoge|ther renouncing her owne merit, and wholly relying vp|on Christs mercie. <HI>Tanto desideranti&ugrave;s ad Christum con|tendit, qu&ograve;d suam indignitatem &amp; immunditiam prob&egrave; sen|tiret:</HI> as <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Postil. maior. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Luther</HI> and <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vbi supra.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ferus</HI> accord in this; and that so truly, that as a Papist said; If <HI>Bonauentura</HI> had not been a Romish saint, he would haue been reputed an asse: So the Protestant, if <HI>Ferus</HI> had not been a Romish asse, he might haue proued in the Church a renowned saint.</P>
<P>The second vertue to bee considered as a fruite of his faith, is adoration; <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thomas ex Chrysost. in loc.</HI></NOTE> a spiritual fee for a spirituall physi|tian: as the bodily Doctor must be paied, so the ghostly prayed. He therefore worships Christ, and that with all

<P>He comes to Christ as a vassall to his Lord: <HI>Domine, non tanquam ad dominum titularem, sed tanquam ad domi|num tutelarem: If thou wilt thou canst.</HI> Out of the abun|dance of the heart the mouth speaketh: and therefore beleeuing in his heart that Christ was the Lord, willing and able to helpe, confesseth it also with his mouth: If it be for my good, I am sure thou wilt: and I beleeue thou canst; attributing all to Christs might and mercie, no|thing to his owne either worth or woe.</P>

<P>The last vertue to be regarded in this leper, is con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es|sion. He knew the Pharisies hated and persecuted al such as confessed Christ: yet he calles him Lord, and worships him as a Lord, and proclaimes him in the presence of much people to bee the Lord. It is well <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Zepper. in loc.</HI></NOTE> obserued, that Gods omnipotent power and infinit mercies are the two wings of our deuotion, whereby faith in the midst of all trouble mounts into heauen. Here the leper acknowled|geth openly Christs omnipotencie: <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Chrysosto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. &amp; Theophylact. in loc.</HI></NOTE> for hee saith not, intreate God, to make me cleane; but, <HI>if thou wilt, thou thy selfe canst</HI>; and therefore thou art the very Christ: neither doth he <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ambros. l. b.</HI> 5. <HI>in Luc.</HI></NOTE> doubt of his mercie, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ludolphus v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i supra.</HI></NOTE> for he saith not, make me cleane, but, <HI>if thou wilt&punc; make me cleane.</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Coster. expli|cat. in loc.</HI></NOTE> It is enough to shew my need, I co~mit the rest to thy cure, to thy care.

<P><PB N="165" REF="85">This may teach vs how to confesse our wickednesse to God, as also to professe his goodnesse vnto men.

<P>Againe, by this example wee may learne to professe the faith of Christ openly, Though <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 2.2.</NOTE> the kings of y^e earth stand vp, and the rulers take counsell against the Lord, and against his anointed. Other happily thinke so, but dare not say so. Some peraduenture say so, though they thinke not so: but I beleeue as I speake, and speake as I beleeue: Lord if thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane.</P>
<P>Hitherto concerning the patient: I come now to the physition, in whom two things are obseruable:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His mercie, who would so readily.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. His might, who could so easily cure such an incu|rable leprosie.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>And Iesus put foorth his hand</HI>] He granted that cheere|fully, which the leper desired earnestly. The leper said, <HI>if thou wilt,</HI> and Christ answereth, <HI>I will</HI>; and as I will, I say, <HI>be thou cleane</HI>; and as I say, I doe. <HI>His leprosie was imme|diatly cleansed:</HI> hee spake the word and it was done; hee commanded and it was effected, euen with a little mo|uing of his lips, and touch of his finger.</P>
<P>Here then is comfort for the distressed soule: the le|per calles, and Christ heales him; the Centurion comes, and Christ helps him. Other Physitions are deceiued of|ten themselues, and often deceiue others; and therefore we venture much, when we trust them a little. The best physicke (as one said) is to take no physicke: but if wee

commit our cause to this heauenly Doctor, our venture is without all peraduenture: for hee cureth all that <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 50.15.</NOTE> call vpon him, and <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 11.28.</NOTE> easeth all that come vnto him.</P>

<P>It was vnlawfull to touch a leper, as we finde, Leu. 14. In that therfore Christ touched here this leper, he shewes himselfe to be greater then <HI>Moses</HI> aboue the law. When <HI>Elisha</HI> cured <HI>Naaman,</HI> hee did not put his hand on the place, because hee was subiect vnto the law; but Christ touched this leper as being Soueraigne of the law. So <HI>Chrysostome, Ambrose, Theophylact, Ludolphus:</HI> and almost all other vpon the place.</P>
<P>Secondly, note with <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Postil. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Melancthon,</HI> that morall duties are to be preferred before ceremoniall offices: and ther|fore Christ neglects a ceremonie to saue his brother, and that according to Gods owne commandement, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Osee</HI> 6.6.</NOTE> <HI>I will haue mercie, not sacrifice.</HI> The best glosse vpon the Gospel is faith: and the best exposition of the law is loue. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thomas ex Chrysost. in loc.</HI></NOTE> Christ therefore did offend the sound of the law, but not the sense.</P>
<P>Thirdly, this intimates that Christ was <HI>homo verus,</HI> and yet not <HI>homo merus</HI>; a very man in touching, but more then a meere man in healing with a touch. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 5. <HI>in Luc. cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>Ambrose</HI> pithily: <HI>Volo dicit propter Fotinum, imperat propter Arium, tangit propter Manichaeum:</HI> He did touch the leper to confute <HI>Manichaeus,</HI> denying him to be very man; he did vse the imperatiue moode, <HI>be thou cleane,</HI> to confound <HI>A|rius,</HI> denying him to be very God.</P>
<P>Fourthly, obserue with <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Maldonat. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cyrillus</HI> of Alexandria, the preciousnes of Christs humanitie, the which vnited vnto the Godhead, is the sole salue of all our sores; his rags are our robes, his crying our reioycing, his death our life, his incarnation our saluation.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="86">Fifthly, with <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ex Chrysost. &amp; Iansen. concor. cap.</HI> 44.</NOTE> <HI>Aquin,</HI> to demonstrate, that himselfe and none other cured him, because himselfe and none other touched him.</P>
<P>Sixthly, with <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>In loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Caluin</HI> and <HI>Marlorat,</HI> Christs hu|mility, who did vouchsafe not onely to talke with the le|per, but also to touch the leper. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Origen.</HI></NOTE> According to this exam|ple, we must learne not to loath any Lazarus, as the rich Glutton in the Gospell, but rather (at it is reported of <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Postil. cathol. con.</HI> 1. <HI>in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Kings daughter of Hungary) to make me|dicines for his maladies, and plaisters for his wounds: in humanity to relieue the distressed; in humility to kisse the very feete of the poore.

<P>Lastly, with <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>contra Marcion.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tertullian</HI> and <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thomas &amp; Chrysost. in loc. &amp; Ludolphus vbi supr&agrave;.</HI></NOTE> other, how Christ in this action respected not the letter, but the meaning, which is the soule of the law.

<P>Now the reason of the law forbidding the cleane to touch vncleane, was, lest hereby they should be polluted. But Christ could not be thus infected; he therefore tou|ched the leper, not to receiue hurt, but to giue helpe: so the text of <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.5.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> is to be construed; <HI>hos deuita.</HI></P>
<P>The Nouice may not be familiar with an old subtill fox; but a iudicious Diuine may confer with an heretike, not to peruert himselfe, but to conuert his aduersary: Christ may touch a leper, if it be to heale him; and the Minister of Christ may teach an heretike, if it be to win him, and not to wound the truth.</P>
<P><HI>I will, be thou cleane] I will.</HI> (<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iames</HI> 4.15.</NOTE> If God will) is the stile of man: our will being subordinate to Gods eternall de|crees; in <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 17.28.</NOTE> whom we liue, and moue, and haue our being.

<P><HI>And immediatly his leprosie was clensed</HI>] This amplifi|eth exceedingly Christs greatnesse and goodnesse: first, in that he cured this vncleane person thorowly, then in that he cured him quickly; for in all our suits vnto men, we desire two things especially, that they deale soundly and roundly. Christ dealt so soundly with this leper, as that he did expose his cure to the censures euen of his ad|uersaries the Priests, of all, most ready to cauill at his ca|riage, and mocke his miracle: so roundly, so speedily, that whereas ordinary physicke must haue time for opera|tion; his extraordinary medicine wrought, as the text saith, <HI>immediatly,</HI> instantly.</P>
<P><HI>Iesus said vnto him, tell no man</HI>] Saint <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 1.45.</NOTE> <HI>Marke</HI> reports, that this leper instantly published the matter, and that in such sort, that Iesus could not openly enter into the Ci|tie, but was without in desert places; and yet people came to him from euery quarter.

<P>This distinction is insufficient; as hauing no firme ground in the Bible. For when almighty God inioines a particular command, for the triall of his people, contrary to the generall scope of his law, he doth at that instant <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Perkins treat. of cons. cap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> dispense with the generall, and the particular onely binds; as in the sacrificing of <HI>Isaac; Offer thy sonne,</HI> was an exemption at that time from the law, <HI>Thou s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alt not kill.</HI></P>
<P>And as for admonitory precepts, how did this leper in|fallibly know, that Christs command, <HI>Tell no man,</HI> was ra|ther an instruction for other, then a prohibition vnto himselfe? Wherefore seeing all Christs iniunctions bind, I subscribe vnto their opinion, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Caluin. &amp; Marlor. in loc.</HI></NOTE> who thinke this leper offended in publishing abroad Christs benefit, notwith|standing he did it affectionately, and zealously.

<P>Hence we may learne to temper our zeale with know|ledge and obedience: for <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.22.</NOTE> obedience is better then sa|crifice.</P>
<P>If any demand, why Christ would haue this miracle concealed: I answere with <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 9.20.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI>; O man, who art thou which disputes against God? <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iob</HI> 9.3.</NOTE> If thou dispute with him, thou canst not answere one thing of a thousand: but he can render a thousand answeres vnto this friuolous obie|ction.

<P>Secondly, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hieron. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Non erat necesse, vt sermone iactaret, quod corpore praeferebat:</HI> It was needlesse to publish the mira|cle, seeing his whole body made cleane, was as it were turned all tongue to tell it.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="88">Thirdly, it was absurd, that the leper should boast he was cleane, before he was iudged to be cleane. Therefore Christ saith in the next clause, <HI>Goe and shew thy selfe vnto the Priest:</HI> and then being adiudged cleane, tell whom thou wilt.</P>

<P>His Apostles did tread in their Masters steps: Acts 25. <HI>Paul</HI> appealed vnto <HI>Caesar,</HI> and appeared before <HI>Caesar,</HI> as his lawfull gouernour. Saint <HI>Iude</HI> detested them for false Prophets, <HI>who despised gouernment, and spake ill of those that

<P>This sentence would not be so grieuous, if it were not so generall, if any wicked man at any time could inioy any kind of peace: but the proposition is an vniuersall ne|gatiue; <HI>non est pax impi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</HI></P>
<P>Our and other translations haue it not in the time past, <HI>non erat,</HI> there was no peace; nor in the future, <HI>non erit,</HI> there shall be no peace; but in the present, there is no peace. Or as it is in the originall, indefinitely without a verbe, naming no time, that wee might feare this iudge|ment at all times: <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lipsius de consianti&acirc;. l.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 13.</NOTE> <HI>Cognatum, im&ograve; innatum omni sceleri sce|leris supplicium.</HI> In the words of Saint <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23.</NOTE> <HI>Paul, the wages of sinne is death</HI>; as the worke is ready, so the pay present, <HI>nec aufertur, nec defertur,</HI> if impiety, no impunity; When sin is <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iam.</HI> 1.15.</NOTE> finished, it hath his hire; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Seneca in Hip|poly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o.</HI></NOTE> <HI>scelus aliquis tutum, nemo securum tulit.</HI></P>
<P>If we consider a wicked man out of <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hugo Cardi|nal. in loc.</HI></NOTE> Christ, he hath neither here peace of grace, nor hereafter peace of glory; but as he passeth from sinne to sinne, he goeth as it were from diuell to diuell, euen from hell to hell, from the

<P>As this includes all time, so likewise excludes all peace.

For the wicked haue no peace with man, no peace with God, no peace with themselues. None with man: for as it is said in the verse before my text, <HI>The wicked are like the raging sea, whose waters cast vp dirt and mire.</HI> They are of their owne nature turbulent; but if we stir them a little, then they fume and some like the sea, both actiue (saith <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>In loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mus|culus</HI>) and passiue, being neither peace makers, nor peace takers.</P>
<P>For nature and scripture tell vs plainly, that righte|ousnesse is elder sister to peace.

Nay, you need not seeke it, for it will finde you; peace will come of it selfe to kisse righteousnesse. On the contrary, no truth, no mercy; where there is no loue of good, there can be no good of loue; no true friendship, except it be <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ron. epist.

<P>It is then an idle phantasie to dreame of an vnity with the Papists, of an vniformity with the Schismatikes: for so long as the one is an enemy to truth, and the other an enemy to peace; so long as both are set on mischiefe, combined in faction, howsoeuer different in faith, I must tell you from <HI>Esay,</HI> and <HI>Esay</HI> from the Lord, <HI>There is no peace to the wicked.</HI></P>

Againe, we must walke in an honest vocation warranted by Gods word, otherwise we shall not run to, but from the prize.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="123">Secondly, we must continue well; for many runne, but one receiueth the crowne: we must therefore take heede that we doe not slip; or if we slip, that we doe not fall; or if we fall, that we fall not backward but forward, so that wee may with speede rise againe. The most iust <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Prou.</HI> 24.16.</NOTE> often slip, and sometime fall, but they fall not backward as <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m.</HI> 4.</NOTE> <HI>Eli,</HI> and the <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ioh.</HI> 18.6.</NOTE> Iewes who tooke Christ, but forward, as <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 18.</NOTE> <HI>Abraham</HI> in the valley of Mambre, and <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ezech.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>Ezechiel</HI> by the riuer Chebar.</P>
<P>Lastly, wee must end well; Death is our last enemie, which must be destroyed, and therefore we must run well vnto the end, and in the end. As good not to runne at all, as to runne neere the end, and then to lose the prize; to suffer Satan at the last houre to snatch our reward from vs. A runner will bee sure to stretch out his hand at the races end to take the marke; so when death approcheth, a Christian must stretch out the hand of faith apprehen|ding Christ and his righteousnesse.</P>
<P>Obserue yet a great difference betweene the Christian and other races. In the games of other runners, as it is here said, one onely doth winne the gole; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ambros. in loc.</HI></NOTE> but in the Christian course many receiue the prize, so many as con|tinue stedfast vnto the end, though they doe not runne so fast, though they doe not runne from so farre as other. So Christ shewes in the parable of the vineyard, allotted for the Gospell on this day; Such as came to worke at the eleuenth houre had a peny, so well as they that came into the vineyard at the third houre.</P>
<P>Secondly, in other races one hinders another; <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Marlorat. ex Caluin. in loc.</HI></NOTE> but in our iourney to heauen one helpes another. The moe the merier, the greater companie the better encouragement, euery good man being a spurre to his neighbour.

<P>Thirdly, runners and wrastlers contend for a crowne that shall perish, but we runne to obtaine an euerlasting
<PB N="241" REF="123">
crowne. They run for a little prize, for a little praise; but wee striue for no lesse then a kingdome that is at stake, that is the marke, which being <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>D.

To propound a garland for the runner, and a crowne for the wrestler, proceeds altoge|ther from Gods owne meere mercy: to run, and not to fall, to fall, and not finally to be cast downe, comes also from his especiall grace. So that it is <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 9.16.</NOTE> neither in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that shewes mercy.

<P>Secondly, some pawne their soules, albeit they be not so desperate, so giuen ouer to commit sinne with greedi|nesse, as to sell their soules right out, yet for their profit and pleasure they will be content to pawne their soules vnto the diuell for a time: so <HI>Dauid</HI> in committing adul|terie did as it were pawne his soule; <HI>Noe</HI> when hee was drunke did pawne his soule; <HI>Peter</HI> in denying Christ did also pawne his soule: but these being all labourers in Gods vineyard redeemed their soules againe, with vn|fained and hartie repentance.

<P>There is another kinde of pawning of soules, and that is vnto God; for Princes and Prelates, Ministers and Ma|sters are bound to God as it were in goods and bodie for all such as are vnder them: as the Prophet said vnto King <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>King.</HI> 20.39.</NOTE> <HI>Ahab; Keepe this man, if he be lost, and want, thy life shall goe for his life.</HI> But if thou dost thy best endeuour, though the wicked incorrigible sinner die for his iniquitie, thou shalt <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ezech.</HI> 33.9.</NOTE> deliuer thy soule, redeeeme thy pawne, and when euening is come, the Lord of the vineyard shall giue thee thy reward.</P>
<P>Thirdly, some lose their soules; as carnall and care|lesse Gospellers, ignorant negligent people, who though they come to Church either for fashion or feare; yet, a|las, they seldome or neuer thinke of their poore soule, from whence it came, or whither it shall goe, trifling a|way the time in the market, neither buying nor selling, nor giuing; but idly gaping and gazing vpon other, a fit pray for the cutpurse, betraying themselues and their soules vnto that old cunnicatcher Satan, who goes about daily, seeking whom he may deceiue, cunningly snatch|ing and stealing such soules as are vnguarded, vnregar|ded. O blockish stupiditie! will you keepe your chicken from the kite, your lambe from the wolfe, your fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne from the hound, your conies and pigeons from the ver|mine; and will not you keepe your soule from the diuell, but idly lose it without any chopping or changing in the market?</P>
<P>Fourthly, some giue their soules, as first the malitious and enuious person: for whereas an ambitious man hath a little honour for his soule; a couetous man a little pro|fit for his soule; a voluptuous man a little pleasure for his soule; the spitefull wretch hath nothing for his soule, but fretting and heart-griefe, like <HI>Cain,</HI> who said of himselfe,
<PB N="249" REF="127">
<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 4.14.</NOTE> Whosoeuer findeth me, shall slay me.</P>
<P>Secondly, such as finally despaire, giue their souls away; for the diuell bestoweth nothing in liew thereof, but hor|ror and hell of conscience. The <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ferus, ser.</HI> 5. <HI>in loc.</HI></NOTE> distressed soule may comfort himselfe with the conclusion of this parable: <HI>The first shall be last, and the last first.</HI> The <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ludolphus in loc.</HI></NOTE> last in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> owne iudgement, the first in Gods eye.</P>
<P>Thirdly, such as destroy their bodie, that the diuel may haue their soule, giue themselues away for nothing: in one word, this is the case of all such as stand idle in the market, they serue the diuels turne for nothing: for <HI>the wages of sinne</HI> (saith <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23.</NOTE> <HI>Paul) is death</HI>; and death is none of Gods workes, a nothing in nature. Why therefore do you stand idle in the market all the day? goe into the vineyard, saith the Lord, and whatsoeuer is right I will giue you.</P>
<P>Now there be diuers labourers in the vineyard, as there be diuers loiterers in the world; one plants, another wa|ters, some dig, some dung; the <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hemingius in loc.</HI></NOTE> householder giues vnto one man a shredding hooke, to another a spade, to a third an hatchet: so there be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s equis, piscator aquis, &amp; clericus hym|nis, nauta fre|tis, pugiles Mar|te, poeta m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tris.</HI></NOTE> sundrie vocations and offices in the Church, diuersities of gifts, and diuersities of admini|strations, and diuersities of operations, 1.

</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All our time is but a day, and that a short day, a win|ters day; for our eternal night is infinitly longer then our temporall day: and alas! it is but a little part of this little day that we worke. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Seneca, epist.</HI> 1. <HI>Multos annos transegi, paucos vixi.

As <HI>Epaminondas</HI> aptly, we must salute young men with good morow, or welcome into the world; old men with good night, because they bee leauing the world; only those of middle age with good day.</P>
<P>Let vs examine then how we spend our noone. Though honest men vse not to sleepe at noone, yet all wee being labourers in Gods haruest and vineyard ordinarily sleepe almost halfe our time. Other houres we waste in eating, other in playing, and that which is worst of all, most of all in sinning: all which time, wee cannot properly bee said to liue; for as the scripture teacheth vs plainly, bad workes are not the workes of light, but of night and darknesse: a day mispent is lost, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Titus V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sp. vti Sucton. in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ius vita.</HI></NOTE> <HI>amici, diem perdidi.</HI></P>

<PB N="252" REF="129">
So, many religious men haue numbred their yeeres, not from the day of their birth, but of their new birth, from their beginning of their regeneration and repentance, reputing all that time lost, which was idly misspent in the market of the world: so that whether we consider our life of nature, or life of grace, our whole time may well be called a short day.</P>
<P>Secondly, a day in regard of our eternal night, in which we cannot worke; for there is no grace in the graue, nor health in hell. <HI>I must worke the workes of him that sent me,</HI> (saith <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 9.4.</NOTE> Christ) <HI>while it is day; the night commeth when no man can worke.</HI> When euen is come the Lord of the vine|yard shall say to his steward, call the labourers, and giue them their hire.

<P>As it was in Corinth, it is in England; the craftie Iesuit, and dissembling schismatike, preuaile more with the people then the true Protestant Preacher. Our popish La|dies are so wise, that they suffer the Iesuit to bring both their credits and consciences into bondage, to deuoure their husbands estate, to take what they list, inioyning penance to other, while they pamper themselues, and ex|alt their order aboue all either Priest or people.</P>
<P>So the Schismatike gaines by losse: as in familiar let|ters, it is the best rhetoricke to vse no rhetoricke: <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Politian. epist. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>epist. Pet.

Some will happily complaine with <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Devil tate condit. human. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> <HI>Innocentius; Iustitia nisi venit, non prouenit, ne&abque; datur nisi vendatur.</HI> So that (as <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">See trauels of Englishmen into far Coun|tries. p. 62.63.</NOTE> trauellers obserue) Diuines are lesse regarded in England, then in any nation of the world, either Christian or heathen.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Paul</HI> in his protestation, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ambros. in loc.</HI></NOTE> calles to witnesse the most mercifull and most mighty, that he speaks nothing but the truth. He that knoweth all, <HI>knoweth I doe not lie.</HI></P>

<P>It appeares then in his preface, that he dealt wisely in his protestation, that hee dealt truly. Some commend themselues truely, but not wisely, moe commend themselues wisely, but not truly. <HI>Paul</HI> here doth both,

<P>To the first, answere is made, that the speech of <HI>Paul</HI> is not a categoricall proposition, but an hypotheticall supposition; <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luther. or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">il. maio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. in l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c.</HI></NOTE> if it were possible that all faith should be without good workes, it were nothing.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Paul</HI> here <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alius apud Occume|nium in loc.</HI></NOTE> speakes not of a iustifying saith, of that faith of beleeuers which is common and gene|rall, but of the speciall gift of faith to worke miracles, of which our Sauiour in the <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 17.6.</NOTE> Gospell; <HI>If yee had faith, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much as a graine of mustard se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de, and should say vnto this mulbery tree, Pluck thy selfe vp by the rootes, and plant th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> selfe in the sea, it should euen obey you.</HI> This hee said vnto the beleeuing Apostles; and therefore cannot bee con|strued of a sauing faith, but of a miraculous faith: and so S. <HI>Ambrose</HI> notes vpon this text, to doe wonders, and to cast out diuels by faith is nothing worth, except a man be an earnest follower of good conuersation.</P>

<P>The second conclusion gathered out of these words against vs is, that faith alone without charitie, nothing auaileth to iustification. Our answere is, that albeit faith is not <HI>solitaria,</HI> yet in our iustification it is <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">la</HI>; <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Perkins re|formed Cat. tit.

<P>Separation <HI>mental</HI> in vnderstanding and consideration is either negatiue or priuatiue. Negatiue, when in the vn|derstanding there is an affirming of one, and denying of another. Priuatiue, when of things that cannot be sepa|rated indeed, yet a man vnderstands the one, and omit|teth

to vnderstand the other. As for example, though light and heate cannot be sepa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated in the fire, yet a man may consider the light, and not the heate: so then in our iustification, wee doe not negatiuely separate other gra|ces from faith, as if faith existed alone without hope and loue, but priuatiuely making them effects and conse|quents, not concur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing causes of our iustification.

Now an hand hath a pro|pertie to reach out it selfe and to receiue a gift, but it can not cut a peece of wood without an hatchet or saw, or some such like instrument, yet by help of them it can ei|ther cut or diuide. Such is the nature of faith, it doth re|ceiue Christ into the heart; but as for the duties of the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st and second table, faith cannot of it selfe bring them forth, no more then the hand can cut of it selfe: yet ioine loue to faith, and then (as our Apostle) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ith worketh through loue,</HI> performing all duties so well to man, as God.</P>
<P>The propertie of true faith is, to receiue in to it selfe. The nature of true loue is to lay out it selfe vnto other: faith then alone iustifieth, apprehending and applying Christs merits vnto it selfe; but it cannot manifest it selfe to other, except it be ioyned with loue: <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> 2.16.</NOTE> <HI>Shew me thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ith out of thy workes.</HI> And thus, as you see, that inward worke of iustification is ascribed in holy Scripture to faith onely; but outward workes of sanct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fication, holi|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sse and righteousnesse, to faith and loue ioyntly.</P>

In a word, the difference betweene faith and hope in Diuini|tie, is the same that is betweene fortitude and prudence in policie.

<ITEM><HI>the Iewes.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>By <HI>Iudas,</HI> out of couetousnesse, as the <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 26.15.</NOTE> text expresly; <HI>What will ye giue me, and I will deliuer him to you?</HI> For a lit|tle siluer, and that not paied, but onely promised, he sold his friend; yea that which is worse, his Master; yea that which is worst of all, his Maker. See the Gospell the Sun|day before Easter.</P>
<P>By the Iewes, out of malice. Matth. 27.18. <HI>Pilat knew
<PB N="295" REF="150">
well that for enuy they deliuered him.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Pilat,</HI> through feare: for the Iewes said vnto him: <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 19.12.</NOTE> <HI>If thou set him free, thou art not Caesars friend: for whoso|euer maketh himselfe a King, speaketh against Caesar.</HI> And therefore <HI>Pilat</HI> chose rather to crucifie the Lord eternall, then to displease <HI>Caesar,</HI> a Lord temporall.</P>
<P>In like sort, all couetous, all malitious, all cowardly professors betray Christ daily. The couetous, who make their coine their Creed, and their penny their <HI>Pater no|ster,</HI> and their bils their Bible, betray Christ with <HI>Iudas.</HI> It is but what will you giue them, and they will deliuer vp the Gospell vnto you.</P>
<P>Enuious men, who persecute the Saints, and disgrace their graces, betray Christ in his members with the Iews, euen for meere malice, speaking to their Christian bro|ther as <HI>Antoninus Caracalla</HI> to his naturall brother; <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>To Gela.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Sit diuus, mod&ograve; non vinus.</HI></P>
<P>Cowardly prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssors vse to betray Christ with <HI>Pilat.</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 13.21.</NOTE> For as soone as tribulation or persecution commeth for the word, they feare more the threats of <HI>Caesar</HI> an earthly Prince, who can kill onely the body, then the wrath of God, who being King of all Kings, is <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 10.28.</NOTE> able to destroy both body and soule in hell.</P>
<P>The second point touching Christs passion, is <HI>illusio.</HI> Now Christ was mocked in foure places especially.</P>
<P N="1">1. In <HI>Caiphas</HI> house, where the keepers <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 22.64.</NOTE> blindfolded him, and smote him on the face, and asked him, saying; <HI>Prophecie; who is it that smot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thee?</HI></P>
<P N="2">In <HI>Herods</HI> company, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 23.11.</NOTE> when as the souldiers arraied him in white.</P>
<P N="3">In the Common hall, where they <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 27.28</NOTE> stripped him, and put vpon him a scarlet robe.</P>
<P N="4">In Golgotha, when he was crucified. First, as Saint <HI>Matthew</HI> in the 27. Chap. by the passengers, wagging their heads, and saying; <HI>Thou that destroiest the Temple, and buildest it in three daies; saue thy selfe, &amp;c.</HI> Then by the Scribes and Pharises; <HI>Hee saued other, but he cannot saue

himselfe.</HI> Last of all, some peruerted his words, affirming that he called for <HI>Elias,</HI> when as he praied; <HI>Eli, Eli,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The popish Clergy mocke Christ with <HI>Caiphas,</HI> in that they blindfold the people, by denying them the Scrip|tures, and then mocke them for their ignorance. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iudges</HI> 16.25.</NOTE><HI>Samson</HI> hauing his ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s out, was a laughing stocke to the Phi|listins: and so the blinde laymen are the Priests pastime. Though a Iesuit or a Seminary buffet them euery day, yet can they not prophecie who smote them. Either <HI>Samson</HI> must pull downe the Colledges of these Philistins, or else he shall neuer see but thorow their spectacles. They mock Christ with <HI>Herod,</HI> who retaine foule consciences in a white rochet, who conforme themselues in habit, but re|forme not themselues in heart.</P>
<P>The Babylonian whore mocks Christ with the souldi|ers, in putting on <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Apocal.</HI> 17.4.</NOTE> skarlet, betokening zeale and charity, when her actions are cruell and bloudy.</P>
<P>They mocke Christ with the Iewes in Golgotha, who distort the words of Scripture for their aduantage, ma|king <HI>Elias</HI> of <HI>Eloi.</HI> Like the popish dolt, who reading the subscription of <HI>Pauls</HI> 2. Epistle to the Thessalonians, in the vulgar Latine; <HI>Missa fuit ex Athenis,</HI> instantly cried out, that he had found a plaine text for the Masse. Or like that foppish Anabaptist, who gathered out of Christs words in English; <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 28.19.</NOTE> <HI>Goe and teach all nations, and baptise, &amp;c.</HI> that it is not lawfull for a Clergy man to ride on a faire palfrey; much lesse, as the Bishops, in a stately coach. Or as that Fen-man, <HI>alias</HI> Fin-man, standing vpon a marsh custom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, iustified his not paiment of Tithes out of <HI>Paul</HI>; <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 13.7.</NOTE> <HI>Custome to whom custome:</HI> but his Pastor replied aptly; <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.16.</NOTE> <HI>the Churches of God haue no such custome.</HI></P>
<P>So the blasphemous mouth spits on Gods face; the tyrants openly crossing the Gospels proceeding, scourge Christ: and all such as slide from the profession of the faith, are said in <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b.</HI> 6.6.</NOTE> scripture, <HI>to crucifie againe the Sonne of God.</HI> And therefore <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Feru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</HI> 1. <HI>&amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. in loc.

<P>As a louing wife which hath her husband slaine, to moue compassion in the Iudges, and to make the fact most odious and hatefull, tels of his deadly wounds, and describes his gastly look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and shewes some garment of his embrued in blood: <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pontan. in loc.</HI></NOTE> so the Church at this time doth offer vnto our considerations how Christ her deare Loue, was betraied, and mocked, and spitted on, and scourged, and put to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath; hereby recalling vs from our horrible sinnes, which as another <HI>Iudas</HI> betray Christ, as another <HI>Herod</HI> mock Christ, as another <HI>Pilate</HI> condemne Christ, as another <HI>Longinus</HI> wound Christ, as another band of Iewes recrucifie Christ.</P>

See before the Creed, and after the Gospell on <HI>Easter</HI> and S. <HI>Thomas</HI> day.</P>
<P>The Prophets vsually mingle the sweet of Christs ex|altation with the sower of his humiliation; as Gen. 49.9. Esay 53.7, 8. Psal. 4.9. and Christ heere foretold the one so well as the other to <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Zepper. in loc.</HI></NOTE> strengthen his followers in af|fliction: for as he first suffered, and after entred into glo|rie; so such as beare with him the crosse, shall be sure to weare with him the crowne. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 6.5.</NOTE> <HI>If we be grafted with him to the similitude of his death, euen so shall we be to the simili|tude of his resurrection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And this saying was hid from them</HI> Men hardly con|ceiue ill of those whom they loue well; and therefore

the Disciples expecting better things of Christ, could not vnderstand this prophecie, but the Iewes (as <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Apud Tho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Beda</HI> notes) hating Christ, and seeking how they might put him to death, easily beleeued him vpon his word, yea one word, and that not so perspicuous as this, but obscure; for when he said, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 12.32.</NOTE> <HI>If I were lift vp from the earth, I will draw all men vnto me</HI>; the Iewes answered him: <HI>We haue heard out of the law, that Christ bideth for euer: and how saist thou that the Sonne of man must be lift vp?</HI></P>
<P>Hence we may note <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Melancthon. postil. in loc.</HI></NOTE> that the dearest Saints of God haue their infirmities and errors; and lest wee should doubt of it, Saint <HI>Luke</HI> repeates it againe: <HI>They percei|ued not the things which were spoken.</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Caluin. apud Mar. orat. in loc.</HI></NOTE> Not that we should follow their ignorance, but praise God for our know|ledge, when we conceiue these deepe mysteries of our saluation.</P>
<P>Againe, we may learne from hence <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Marlorat. in Matth.</HI> 20.19.</NOTE> not to be discou|raged, if we do not at the first discerne Gods holy word: for the blessed Apostles after Christs resurrection vnder|stood all these things, as S. <HI>Luke</HI> reports in his last chap|ter, vers. 45. God at his good time, will open our eyes, as he did the blindmans in this Gospel, and open our eares, as he did of the Prophet, Esay 50. and open our hearts, as he did of <HI>Lydia,</HI> Act. 16.</P>

There is nothing in the sheepe but good; his fell is good, his flesh is good, his entrals good, his dung good: so the lambes of Christ must be profitable to all, hurtfull to none.</P>

And it is most certaine that the state of the spiritually blind is more miserable then that of the other blind; for to want the eyes of Angels, is worse then to want the eyes of beasts, as <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Granaten. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Antonius</HI> told that good blind man <HI>Didymus.</HI></P>
<P>As the bodily blind is led either by his seruant, or wife, or dogge; so the spiritually blind misled by the world, the flesh and the diuell: the bodily blind will be sure to get a seeing guide, but the spiritually blinde followeth his owne <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccles.</HI> 18.30.</NOTE> lusts and the blind guides; and so the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 15.14.</NOTE> blind
