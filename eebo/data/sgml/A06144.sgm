<HEAD>TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY King, <HI>Iames</HI> by the grace of God, King of Great Bri|tane, Fraunce, and Ire|land, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_ARchimedes</HI> a famous Mathematician (most mightie Prince) sayd, If he had but a place to stand free fro~ the earth, he could inuent meanes to mooue the whole earth: some such there be though not like <HI>Archimedes,</HI> to mooue the whole earth; yet they mooue Countreys and Kingdomes on the earth. And as <HI>Dinocrates</HI> that skilfull Archi|tector thought to bring mount <HI>Atho,</HI> to the lowe forme and stature of a man, so some would bring hie Mountaines, and great hilles, as lowe as mould-hilles.</P>
<P>Of such wee may nowe so say in <HI>Britane,</HI> as <HI>Pole|mo</HI> spake sometime of counterfeit Tragedians in <HI>Smyrna,</HI> who with their false Solaechismes, lifting vp their dissembling eyes to heauen, saying, <HI>O coelum,</HI> when their treacherous hearts and bloody hands be

on earth, saying, <HI>O terra.</HI> These bee they that haue with the Traitor <HI>Saba,</HI> what portion haue we in the Sonne of <HI>Isa,</HI> or in the house of <HI>Iudah</HI>?</P>
<P>Against such, <HI>Ioshua</HI> made a law in Israel, that no counterfeit Gibeonite should beare Office in <HI>Iudah,</HI> but hewe wood, and carrie water for Israel.</P>
<P><HI>Iepthe</HI> made likewise a lawe, that no foresworne Giliadite that could not pronounce <HI>Schibboleth,</HI> should passe ouer <HI>Iorden.</HI></P>
<P>Your Maiestie made also a lawe, that no treache|rous ambitious Papist that had <HI>Iacobs</HI> voice, and <HI>E|saus</HI> handes should stay within great <HI>Britane,</HI> they should either obey the Romane lawe, <HI>lex Iulia,</HI> or the Athenians law <HI>Ostrachismos</HI>; &amp; therefore was the rodde of <HI>Aaron,</HI> and the lawe Booke commaunded to bee kept together in the Arke, <HI>Vt quiescant querel<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Iudaeorum,</HI> which King <HI>Iosias</HI> had, both the Sword, &amp; the Law booke carried before him, <HI>Tanquam insign<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> Principis.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Themistocles</HI> wished a bridge of gold for <HI>Xerxes</HI> ar|mie to passe out of <HI>Greece</HI> vnto <HI>Persia.

<HEAD>The Tragicomedie of Serpents.</HEAD>
<P>_I Haue promised to adde some|thing to my last little Trea|tise, <HI>The practise of pollicie,</HI> I thought I should write but of the pollicie of men, yet I haue cause to speake of di|uers kinds of Serpents, of Diuels Serpents, of Idols Ser|pents, of Image Serpents, of beasts serpents, and of men serpents, which are the most perilous serpents of all, according to the old saying, <HI>Homo homini Lupus,</HI> not only a Wolfe, but a Lyon, a Tygre, a Diuell to a man.</P>
<P><HI>Hanniball,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hanibal a sworne ene|my to the Romans.</HI></NOTE> a sworne enemy to the Romans, not only himselfe, but soliciting the great <HI>Antiochus</HI> with Camels, and <HI>Pirrhus</HI> before him with his Ele|phants, and he himselfe with serpents and vipers to throwe in the faces of the Roman army, to amaze their souldiers, and to put them in fright in their
<PB N="2" REF="6">
fight; Stratagems allowed in warre, but not among peaceable christians.</P>
<P>But these stratagems were of <HI>Affrica</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> a|gainst the Romans, who had but Camels &amp; Elepha~ts for their chiefe pollicy, with the which the Romans became well acquainted, and exceeded them in their owne stratagems, and ouerthrew their <HI>Han|niball.</HI></P>
<P>But now in Rome their is another kind of <HI>Hanni|ball,</HI> whose stratagems are furnished with Wolues, Beares, Dragons, and Tygres, and those in the habit of men, that farre passe <HI>Tarquine</HI> the proud with his furious priests, with Snakes in one hand, and fire|brands in the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zozom, lib.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> and their <HI>Affrican Hanniball</HI> with his Serpents in one vessell, and vipers in the other; but these would haue Lyons in one hand, and Vni|cornes in the other.</P>
<P>But we feare not the Camels of <HI>Asia,</HI> nor the Ele|phants of <HI>India,</HI> nor the Serpents of <HI>Affrick,</HI> neither do we feare the Basilisks of Rome, and the Romish broode in great Brittane, which would faine ride on Lyons and Vnicornes.</P>
<P>For it was a long custome among the Romans, to fight with Lyons on the Theators,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The cus|tome of Rome.</HI></NOTE> and with wilde cruell beasts, that the Romans became more cruell then Serpents, and such Serpents that <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> are full of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serpents borne in mens armes in</HI> Asia.</NOTE>In <HI>Asia,</HI> they carie Serpents in their armes to clense their aire, to purifie their temples, and to driue di|uels away from their Townes and Cities.</P>
<P>In <HI>Rome</HI> they sent for Serpents in any plague time to <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> to the jmage of <HI>Esculap:</HI> whome they
<PB N="3" REF="6">
worshipped in the forme of a Serpent, to heale them.</P>
<P>We ouercame the old Dragon, the great Serpent in Paradise, by the seede of the woman. The chil|dren of <HI>Israell</HI> ouercame the serpents of <HI>Cadis-barne</HI> by looking vpon the brasen Serpent in that wilder|nes, and <HI>Moses</HI> with his Hebrew army escaped the serpents in the deserts of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> by their continuall enemies, the birdes Ibides of <HI>Egipt.</HI></P>
<P>But we haue armed serpents,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The armed Serpents of</HI> Medea.</NOTE> engendred of the serpents teeth, which <HI>Medea</HI> not of <HI>Colchos</HI> but of <HI>Babilon,</HI> where they carry such serpents in their armes, I meane their golden and siluer Gods, to bee worshipped of men in the streetes, these be the dan|gerous serpents.</P>
<P>After such serpents ran <HI>Laban</HI> after <HI>Iacob</HI> of more complaining for his jdols and images the Gods of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Gods, Mesopota|mia.</HI> Gen. 31.</NOTE> tha~ for his two daughters <HI>Iacobs</HI> wiues, saying, <HI>cur fu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">atus es Deos meos,</HI> why hast thou stolne my Gods away from me.</P>
<P><HI>Micah</HI> ran for such serpents after the Tribe of <HI>Dan</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mychaes Idoll.</HI> Iudg. 18.</NOTE> exclaiming more for his idols, then for all the wealth and goods that they took from him, saying, <HI>Cur Deos quos mihi feci, tulistis?</HI> why haue you taken my Gods which I made to my selfe, from me?</P>
<P>Many ran from great Brittane after such Gods,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Many ran after their Gods from great Brit|tane.</HI></NOTE> and such images, to <HI>Rome,</HI> to <HI>Spaine</HI>; and many yet lurkes like <HI>Hydra</HI> in <HI>Laerna,</HI> in their secret labyrinths more greedy for the spoyle like moabites, than true catholikes for religion; these be the Roman wolues in sheeps clothing, like <HI>Camelions</HI> in al kind of colors, scattered ouer all England, these be the domesticall
<PB N="4" REF="7">
serpents, <HI>tanquam lemures nocturni &amp; lares domestici</HI>: in Cities, in townes, yea, in our houses vnknowne, and not vnseene enemies. I meane those rebels and Trators,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>the target of treason.</HI></NOTE> which vnder colour of religion, attempted sundry times our late queene, and now our soue|ragine Lord and King.</P>
<P>That neither <HI>Hanniball</HI> with his fiery oxen, was so furious against <HI>Fab. Max:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Front. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> and his Roman ar|mie.</P>
<P>Neither was <HI>Darius,</HI> with his barking dogs, and braying Asses left in his tents to deceiue the <HI>Scythi|ans,</HI> so crafty.</P>
<P>Neither desperate <HI>Tarquine</HI> so cruell, to vnbridle all the horses of his army, and so to rush vnto the middest of the <HI>Sabins</HI> his enemies, as these late fierie oxen, these barking Dogs and braying Asses, left too long to barke and braye in great Brittaine; these desperate horses, too long suffered to bee vnbridled in England.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Front. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>The subiect of this booke is to write of Serpents, be|cause we are troubled with serpents.</HI></P>

<P>I wish there were more such trees in great Brit|taine, for trees are aptly compared to men; so are Kings, Princes and Potentates of the earth, compa|red to the hygh &amp; great Caedar trees in <HI>Libanon</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Men aptlie compared to trees.</HI></NOTE> the palme trees to the constant martyres&punc; the Oliue trees to the iust and godly men; and Christ himselfe to

<P><HI>Melancthon</HI> was requested to shew the cause why serpents bred in the raines and bowels of dead men;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Euang. in Die. pasc.</HI></NOTE> answered, that man being infected with the poyson of the first Serpent in Paradise, since which he cea|seth not,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug. ad fratres in Eremo serm.</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>viuentibus insidiari, nec mortuos laniare,</HI> you shall find in dead mens sculs Toads engendred of the braine, and serpents engendred in the raines, <HI>inuenie|tis generatos in cerebro bufones, &amp; in renibus serpentes,</HI> saith <HI>Augustine.</HI></P>
<P>These be serpents by nature, serpents by educati|on, and serpents by succession, which shead much blood, and cause great slaughter in <HI>England, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Fraunce.</HI></P>
<P>It was not the great army of <HI>Xerxes</HI> at <HI>Marathon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">30. <HI>Tyrants in Athens.</HI></NOTE> nor the great force of <HI>Philip</HI> at <HI>Chaeronea,</HI> that so frighted the Athenians, as the bloody streetes in A|thens, where the children were forced to daunce in the bloud of their parents, in the tyme of the 30. Tyrants, and yet <HI>Thrasibulus</HI> banished these tyrants from Athens.</P>
<P>Neither was it the tyrany of <HI>Antiochus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Reg. 21. <HI>Sesostris in Herodot.</HI></NOTE> King of <HI>Cy|ria,</HI> nor King <HI>Susacus</HI> of <HI>Egipt,</HI> that so feared the Iews, as the bloudy streets in Ierusalem, where one neigh|bor might wash his hands in the bloud of another in the time of <HI>Manasses.</HI> Yet <HI>Iosias</HI> deliuered <HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P>But these serpents, these Harpeis, these Croco|diles determined to leaue neither parents, children,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
or neighbors aliue, but themselues to daunce in our bloud. Such a daunce delighted <HI>Nabuchodonozer</HI> in <HI>Babilon</HI> of <HI>Misael, Sidraach,</HI> and <HI>Abednago.</HI> Such a daunce of <HI>Herodias</HI> delighted <HI>Herod,</HI> for <HI>Iohn</HI> Bap|tists head.</P>
<P>And such a daunce would haue pleased the Anti|christ of <HI>Rome,</HI> if their Roman Tragedy begun, had not ended like a Brittane comedy; and if their E|giptian daunce begunne by <HI>Pharo,</HI> had not ended like the tryumphant daunce by <HI>Iacob.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sylla. Caligula.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elias <HI>sacri|fice.</HI></NOTE>But such fire as fell vppon <HI>Elias</HI> sacrifice, shall fall vppon these priests of <HI>Bael,</HI> such gaping gulfs of the earth that swallowed vp aliue <HI>Chore, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiran,</HI> shal swallow vp these rebellious Seminaries.</P>
<P>Some thinke that it would be as great a tryumph to that Roman <HI>Achab,</HI> the hauing of King <HI>Iames</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> as was to <HI>Tamberlaine,</HI> the hauing of <HI>Baiazet</HI> the great Turke in <HI>Scythia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oros. lib.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 22.</NOTE> or the hauing of the Ro|man <HI>Valerianus</HI> prisoner to King <HI>Sapor</HI> in <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>But these Serpents forgat that <HI>Pharo</HI> could not harme <HI>Moses,</HI> neither <HI>Saul</HI> destroy <HI>Dauid,</HI> they forgat though all <HI>Egipt</HI> was punished with terrible &amp; hor|rible
<PB N="7" REF="8">
plagues, yet the land of <HI>Gosen</HI> where <HI>Israell</HI> dwelt, was not troubled with their frogs, locusts, flies, lice, neither with darknes, bloud or slaughter, they forgat what God sayd to his people, <HI>erit sanguis vobis signum salutis</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 12.</NOTE> when the first borne of <HI>Egipt</HI> were killed throughout all <HI>Egipt,</HI> they forgat the marke which God set vpon his people in <HI>Hierusalem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech 9.</NOTE> <HI>super quem videritis Tau, ne occidatis.</HI></P>
<P>But these desperat Traytors, these malicious Ser|pents, contemne Laws, despise Magistrates, way nei|ther for the sword nor the word of God co~mitted to the Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sauls <HI>seed.</HI> 2 Reg. 21.</NOTE> but as long as any of <HI>Sauls</HI> seed liued in <HI>Israel,</HI> the Gibonites could not be in quiet, neither would they suffer <HI>Dauid</HI> to take any rest.</P>
<P>But how shall we helpe this and purifie great Brit|tane of these monstrous broode,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The brood of Ena|chims.</HI></NOTE> the brood of <HI>Ena|chims?</HI> they will not come to heare of God in his church, as the <HI>Ethiopian Eunuch</HI> went to <HI>Phillip</HI>; they will not with <HI>Naman</HI> the <HI>Syrian</HI> be cleansed of their leprosy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Reg: <HI>cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> in the flud <HI>Iorden:</HI> they haue water in <HI>Da|masco, Abanah,</HI> and <HI>Pharpar</HI>; they haue water in <HI>Rome, aquam mercurij, &amp; aquam benedictam.</HI></P>
<P>They had rather drinke of the puddles of <HI>Betha|uen</HI> with <HI>Ieroboam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The puddles of</HI> Ierobo|am.</NOTE> than of the well of <HI>Bethell</HI> with <HI>Iacob,</HI> they had rather trust to the mountaines of <HI>Sa|maria,</HI> than to be rich in <HI>Sion.</HI></P>
<P>How shall this be redrest and cleare our country of them?</P>
<P>If,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diuers kinds of pu|rifications among the Gentiles.</HI></NOTE> as among the Romans who bound such in bags and threwe them in <HI>Tyber,</HI> too many should bee drowned.

the Graecians, with fire and brimstone, too many should be burned.</P>
<P>Better rather as <HI>Theseus</HI> did, to seeke out their la|byrinths, &amp; to finde these late brood of <HI>Minotaurus,</HI> that seeke to feed vpon the bloud of their country|men, like <HI>Gorgons.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg: 11. <HI>The false Ephramites could not pronounce Schiboleth.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P><HI>Clemens</HI> the 5 a little before he died, being in a great agonie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In speculo. Pontif.</HI></NOTE> sayd to his friends, Now I shall know that, of which I long doubted; whether there were another life after this.</P>
<P>I would rather preferre <HI>Adrian</HI> the heathen Em|perour before these two Christian Popes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>El. Spart.</HI></NOTE> who in the like extasie spake to his soule trembling, <HI>Tremula &amp; vagula quae nunc abibis in loca?</HI> Now poore soule whether wilt thou goe? wee are not to wonder at <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperour so to say and doe, when Pope <HI>Clemens</HI> so doubted, and where his soule should goe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scen. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>de gest. Alphons.</HI></NOTE>And <HI>Zisca Imperator Hussitarum,</HI> being moo|ued of his souldiers how he would be buried, com|maunded them to flay and take his skinne off him be|ing dead, and to giue his bodie to wilde beasts, and to make of his skinne a militarie drumme, that his e|nemies that feared his sight aliue, might feare the sound of his skinne being dead.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="52">This Emperours buriall was much like to resolute Pope <HI>Siluester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Polyd. lib.</HI> 5 <HI>de rerum inuent.</HI></NOTE> who sought by oracles of diuers, how long he should liue? was answered, <HI>Diu, si cauer et Hie|rusalem</HI> (if he kept from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> in <HI>Iudah</HI>) yet hee happened to say a Masse vpon an Altar called <HI>Hieru|salem,</HI> confessed his fault, and commaunded his bo|die to be drawne by two horses, and where the hor|ses stayed, there to be buried.</P>
<P>Many happen to die by chance, whose cause is doubtfull,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hugo de a|nim. clas.</HI></NOTE> vnknowne, and hidden; many die by in|firmities, whose causes are apparant; &amp; many by age, whose causes are present, so doth an old writer set downe; but some die neither by chaunce, nor by infirmities, nor by age, but die for want of grace to liue longer, that now if <HI>Theophrastus</HI> had liued, hee would not haue accused nature, for the short time of a mans life, for that he sayd, Men died when men be|gan to be wise,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theophra|stus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>cum incipimus sapere, morimur:</HI> but now <HI>Theophrastus</HI> would haue sayd, Men die before they begin to liue well.</P>
<P>These be like Phisitians, who after they kill many in many Countreys, yet are they free, and at their libertie to goe euerie where without punishment. These may laugh and sing at burials for their gaines, when others weepe and mourne for their losses.</P>
<P>I remember a historie in <HI>Plinie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plin. lib</HI> 28 <HI>cap.</HI> 3.</NOTE> that an Embassador came from <HI>Cypris</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> his name was <HI>Exagon,</HI> who among other monuments, he saw the Consuls bring certain vessels full of Serpents:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Exagon.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Exagon</HI> thinking that the Romanes thought him to be fearefull, willed the Consuls to throw him among those Serpents, which so lickt and winded round about this <HI>Exagon,</HI> that he
<PB N="96" REF="53">
came laughing from the Serpents to the Consuls.</P>
<P>This was a great terrour to the Romanes, and yet was a stratageme, that <HI>Haniball</HI> taught the Romanes, and to all the Kings of <HI>Asia</HI> against the Romanes.</P>
<P>But the Romans like the Cappadocian, who after the Viper bit him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Cappado|cian.</HI></NOTE> they looked as they did at <HI>Paul</HI> for the like, when the Cappadocian would die, but the Cappadocian liued, and the Viper died; such haps sometime happen.</P>
<P>But as I sayd of Romane <HI>Marcellus,</HI> and <HI>Fabius</HI>: so likewise I pray vnto God, that there be not many such <HI>Exagons</HI> in great <HI>Britane,</HI> that these Serpents and Vipers may licke and winde about them, to the de|struction of their Countrey.</P>
<P>These be not like <HI>Lazarus</HI> doggs that licked their Masters soares for loue;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lazarus dogges.</HI></NOTE> but like <HI>Acteons</HI> dogges that deuoured their Maister.</P>
<P>Like <HI>Ioab</HI> that killed <HI>Abner</HI> embracing him in his armes.</P>
<P>And like <HI>Iudas</HI> the Traitor, that kissed his Master, and straight betrayed him. There were neuer so many dumb dogs, as now be biting, &amp; not barking.</P>
<P>These be <HI>Lemures nocturni,</HI> and alwayes conuer|sant with vs in our houses, like <HI>Lares domestici,</HI> that can and may deceiue vs, because wee trust them, are now become <HI>Tortuosi Serpentes,</HI> which came after long lurking in their secret Labyrinths, <HI>Per mille Mae|andros,</HI> to plague their Countrey.</P>
<P>But yet now they are much frighted with <HI>Ierobo|am,</HI> who doubting least the Kingdome of Israel shuld returne to the house of <HI>Dauid,</HI> by meanes of the mul|titude of people which went to offer sacrifice at <HI>Ieru|salem,</HI>

builded <HI>Rama<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and other stronge holds, and made two golden Calues to entice <HI>Israel</HI> to Idolatrie.</P>
<P>These Iesuites and Seminaries haue hornes ready made, and they promise their Maister the Pope, as <HI>Zedechia</HI> did to <HI>Achab</HI> victorie, and say, <HI>Hijs venti|labis Britanniam donec deleas eam.</HI> And if that faile, <HI>Ba|lacke</HI> shall cause <HI>Balaam</HI> for reward, to curse <HI>Britane</HI> with Bookes and Bels.</P>
<P>So did <HI>Golias</HI> curse <HI>Dauid</HI> in the name of his Gods.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Reg.</HI> 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> did vse to baptize, and name Bels,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heidfield. de tempore.</HI></NOTE> and annoint the same; by the sound of which Bels, they coniure Diuels from their houses, terrifie their enemies, purifie the ayre, curse and excom|municate whome they list.</P>
<P><HI>Raimerus</HI> the 5 King of <HI>Arragon</HI> published, that he would make such a great Bell, that all <HI>Spaine</HI> should heare the sound of it.</P>
<P>Some of his noble-men iesting and scoffing at this Bell, lest it should be like the cursing Bell of <HI>Rome,</HI> des|pised the same speech. But they were apprehended and commanded by <HI>Raimerus</HI> to be put to the sword, saying, <HI>Nescit vulpecula cum quo laudat.</HI></P>
<P>The like punishment had many that spake against the Bels and Buls of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Surely we shall neuer be able to end this quarrell, or make a lawe, as <HI>Elias</HI> did with <HI>Achabs</HI> Prophets, and as <HI>Daniel</HI> did with <HI>Nabuchadnezars</HI> priests, and so execute the lawe according to their composition, which was effected by the commandement of these two great idolatrous Kings, the one at the brooke <HI>Kyson,</HI> the other at <HI>Babilon.</HI></P>
