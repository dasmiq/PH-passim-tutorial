<HEAD>TO
All such of the
CITY,
WHO
Have seen the Desolations
OF
LONDON
BY
The late Judgments of PLAGUE
and FIRE.</HEAD>
<P>IT might have seemed more sea|sonable
unto some, if a work of
this nature had come forth unto view
more immediately after the sound of
Gods terrible voice, and execution, at
<PB REF="3">
least, of the last dreadfull Iudgment
of the Fire; because if a Man strikes
whilst the Iron is hot, it is likely to
make the more deep impression, which
when it grows cool, growes hard and
unmalleable; and if the hammer of
the Word had been used, when <HI>Lon|don</HI>
was newly come forth of the Fur|nace,
some might think they would
have yielded the more easily unto it's
strokes, and the better have receiv|ed
the fashion, which this Hammer
would work them unto; and that,
since the fresh and lively remem|brance
of the judgement is more worn
off, it is to be feared, that they are
more cooled and hardned, and there|fore
in likelihood, it will be more dif|ficult
to effect a due impression of the
Iudgements by the Word upon them:
yet, besides that it was not in my
thoughts to attempt this Work, un|til
<PB REF="3">
the greatest part of the Winter was
spent: I may further adde, that,
though a discourse concerning the
Plague, would have been most season|able
under the Iudgment it self, when
people who were generally taken off
from their trading, had room and
time for retirement and considerati|on,
more than ever they had in their
lives before; and therefore were more
likely to lay to heart, what might be
spoken or written unto them on that
Subject: yet the reason is not
the same in the Iudgement of
the Fire, which (however start|ling
and astonishing) was so far from
giving them retiring time for consi|deration,
as the former Iudgement
of the Plague had done, that it did
engage them unto more labourious
works than ever they had, not only
while <HI>London</HI> was burning, in re|moving
<PB REF="4">
what they could save of their
goods from the Fire; but also since,
in looking out new Habitations, and
fitting their Houses and Shops for
Trades; which hath given them oc|casion
for so much distraction, that I
fear they could hardly settle their
mindes to read and consider so seri|ously
as they should, what the Lord
hath been doing with them, &amp; speak|ing
unto them by this Terrible Voice,
which hath sounded so loud in their
ears: but by this time, I hope, that the
most have attained to some kinde of
settlement, at least so much, as to give
them leave to sit down and ponder
upon the meaning of God, in these
strange and dreadful Iudgements of
Plague and Fire in the City; and
therefore this Book may be more sea|sonable
unto the most, than if it had
been written, and presented to them
<PB REF="4">
immediately after the Fire had burnt
them out of their habitations.
Friends, It is high time for all of
you to retire your selves, and be|think
your selves, and wisely to
consider Gods dealings with you, to
open your ear, and labour to under|stand
these speaking Iudgments, least
if God be provoked, by your deafness,
and incorrigibleness, to speak a third
time, it be in your utter ruine and
desolation. If these Papers be
any wayes helpfull to revive in your
memories the Iudgments themselves,
by the Historicall Narration which
here you have of them; to work your
hearts to some sense of sin in disco|very
of the cause; and to perswade
you unto a ready compliance with
Gods design in the declaring of what
God now expects from you, after
such dreadfull executions; as yours
<PB REF="5" MS="y">
will be the benefit: so I desire that
God may have the whole glory; and
that you would make this return for
my help of you, to help me with your
prayers, that I may be the more help|full
to you in mine, who am</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_SHall a Trumpet be blown in the City,
and the people not be afraid? Shall
there be evil in the City, and the
Lord hath not done it? The Lyon
hath roared, who will not fear? the
Lord God hath spoken, who can but
Prophesie? Am. 3. 6. 8. <HI>When the Pharisees
spake to our Saviour to rebuke his Disciples for
their loud praises of the Lord with</HI> Hosanna's, <HI>he
tells them,</HI> If they should hold their peace, the stones
would immediately cry out, Luk. 19. 39, 40. <HI>And
we read in</HI> Habakkuk, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. 11. Of the stone
crying out of the wall, and the beam out of the tim|ber
making answer. <HI>Certainly we in</HI> London <HI>have
lately heard the</HI> cry of stones and walls, of timber
and beams in their fall and flames; <HI>I mean in the
late</HI> Dreadful Fire <HI>which hath laid out</HI> Ierusalem
<PB N="2" REF="6">
<HI>in heaps; or rather we have heard the Voice of
God in this and other terrible things which have
come upon us; Let none then rebuke, if one
so unfit do make an attempt to speak something
of the meaning of</HI> Londons <HI>Fire, or of Gods
Terrible Voice in this and other Judgements,
when by the mouth of Babes God can declare his
Will.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer
us.</HEAD>
<P>THis whole Psalm breathes forth nothing but
grace and goodness unto the people of God,
from the beginning of it to the end; yea, in the
verse of my Text where God speaks most terribly
and righteously in the Judgements and Destru|ctions
which he bringeth upon their Enemies, yet
he is called the God of their Salvation, and those
terrible things by which God speaks, are not on|ly
a <HI>righteous answer</HI> unto their Enemies sins, but
also a <HI>gracious answer</HI> unto his peoples prayers. <HI>By
terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not speak of terrible things in the re|strained
sense, as they befall the Enemies only
of Gods people, and the wicked, whilst the
righteous do escape, and it may be hereby are
preserved; but as they may befall any people,
not excluding Gods people, whom the Lord may
answer by terrible things in righteousness.</P>
<P>Two Doctrines we may observe.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
<HI>Doct.</HI> 1. That God doth sometimes speak unto a
People by terrible things.</P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> 2. That when God doth speak most terri|bly,
he doth answer most righteously.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That God doth sometimes speak unto a People
by terrible things.</P>
<P>Here I shall show:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. How God may be said to speak.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What those terrible things are by which God doth
sometimes speak.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Why God doth sometimes speak unto a People by
terrible things; and then apply.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>1. How God may be said to speak.</P>
<P>God being a Spirit, hath no Mouth nor Tongue
properly as men have, who have bodies, and
therefore his way of speaking is not like ours
(though sometimes he hath created a Voice in as
articulate sound as if it had proceeded from the
mouth of man to declare his will) but there are
several wayes in which God hath spoken and
doth speak unto the Children of men, by which
he doth as really and effectually make known his
mind, as if he spake with mans voice.</P>
<P>1. God hath spoken formerly unto men <HI>im|mediately,</HI>
in <HI>extraordinary</HI> wayes, and that some|times
more terribly; as when he gave the Law
upon Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> when the Mount burned with
fire, and there was blackness, and darkness, and
tempest, thundrings and lightnings, and the sound
of the Trumpet exceeding loud, and the voice
of words so exceeding terrible, that it made the
whole Camp to tremble; and <HI>Moses</HI> himself said,
<HI>I exceedingly fear and quake, Exod. 19. 16. Heb.</HI> 12.
18, 19, 20, 21.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">
This way of Gods speaking the Children of
<HI>Israel</HI> were not able to bear, therefore they desi|red
that <HI>Moses</HI> might speak unto them, but that
God would not speak unto them thus any more,
least they should die, <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. 19.</P>
<P>At other times God spake with a more still
and gentle voice, and in a more milde way, as
when he spake to <HI>Samuel</HI> in the night, he thought
at first that it had been the voice of <HI>Eli, 1 Sam.</HI> 3.
4, 5. Thus God spake unto <HI>Abraham,</HI> unto <HI>Ia|cob,</HI>
unto <HI>Moses,</HI> to whom it is said, he spake face
to face, as a man speaketh to his friend, <HI>Exod.</HI> 33.
11.</P>
<P>God spake also in an extraordinary way to his
Prophets of old, when he made known unto
them his counsel, that they might declare it un|to
the people: Sometimes he spake unto them
with an audible voice, which he created when
no Shape was seen; sometimes by Angels, who
appeared in bodies, which they laid down again
when they had delivered their message; some|times
by <HI>Dreams</HI> and <HI>Visions</HI> in the night; some|times
by <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim;</HI> sometimes by
more secret <HI>Inspirations</HI> of the <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>In the last daies of Gods <HI>extraordinary speak|ing,</HI>
he spake by the most <HI>extraordinary person,</HI>
namely, by his own most dearly beloved and only
begotten Son, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 1, 2. whom he sent out of
his bosom to declare himself, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1. 18. and re|veal
what he had heard of the Father, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 15. 15.
who brought life and immortality to light by the
Gospel, and made known Gods purpose and
Grace in mans Salvation, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 9, 10. and ut|tered
such things as were kept secret from the
<PB N="5" REF="7">
foundations of the world, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. 35. The
Gospel began to be spoken of by the <HI>Lord Iesus</HI>
himself, and was continued and confirmed by his
Apostles, who were his Witnesses, to whom God
also did bear witness with signs and wonders, and
divers Miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
according to his will, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 3, 4.</P>
<P>2. And now, though not so immediately, and
in such extraordinary wayes, <HI>yet still</HI> God doth
speak unto the Children of men. There are two
wayes of Gods speaking now unto men; name|ly,
his <HI>Word</HI> and his <HI>Works.</HI></P>
<P>1. His <HI>Word</HI> contained in the Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament, which holy men wrote
as they were inspired by the Holy Ghost, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.
21. And thus God speaketh either <HI>externally</HI> by
his Word alone, or <HI>internally</HI> with his Word by
his Spirit.</P>
<P>1. God speaketh now unto men <HI>externally</HI> by
his Word alone, to some more <HI>silently,</HI> unto
whom he gives his Scriptures only to be read, and
brings to their view his written Word alone,
without the advantage of other Ordinances, which
might more powerfully declare unto them his
will.</P>
<P>Unto others he speaks more <HI>audibly,</HI> where
the Gospel doth sound in their ears, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">h the
Scriptures God sendeth his Ministers to preach
unto them.</P>
<P>God speaketh by his Ministers, who are his
<HI>Watchmen,</HI> in his Name to warn the people of his
Judgements temporal and eternal, which in the
Scriptures he hath threatned, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3, 17 18, &amp;c.
<HI>Isa.</HI> 63. 6. who are the Lords <HI>Embassadors, 2 Cor.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
5. 20. from whom they have a Commission to
preach the Gospel, and declare the glad tidings
of Salvation unto all such as repent, and believe,
and yield up themselves unto the obedience of
the Word.</P>
<P>Ministers stand in the room of Christ; and it
is well for us that God speaks unto us by Mini|sters,
because we should not be able to endure,
should he speak unto us immediately by himself;
should he speak unto us with an audible voice, as
he did to the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI>
when he gave the Law, this would be so terri|ble,
that with them we should desire to heat <HI>Mo|ses,</HI>
and chuse Ministers rather to speak unto us;
yea, if Christ Jesus himself should come down
from heaven, however he might have been heard
in his state of Humiliation, when his Deity was
so much vailed; yet if he should now appear in
the glory he hath with the Father; or as he ap|peared
unto <HI>Iohn</HI> his Beloved Disciple, when his
eyes were as a flame of fire, and his countenance
like the Sun when it shineth in its full strength,
and his voice like the sound of many waters: I
say, if Christ should thus appear and preach unto
us, such a dread and amazement would fall upon
us, that we should fall down dead at his feet,
as his Disciple <HI>Iohn</HI> did, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
Therefore it is better for us in this state of weak|ness,
that God speaketh to us by Ministers, men
of like passions and infirmities with our selves,
whom we may be able to bear, and whose words
notwithstanding our weakness, we may be able to
hear.</P>
<P>2. God doth now also speak unto men <HI>inter|nally</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
with his Word by his <HI>Spirit,</HI> when God sends
his Spirit with his Word for <HI>Conviction</HI> only, or
some Common work: thus God calls upon the
wicked, who sit under the preaching of the Word,
moves and strives with them by his Spirit, but they
resist the spirit, stifle Convictions, &amp; wil not heark|en
to his calls and motions, <HI>Gen. 6. 3. Act.</HI> 7. 51.</P>
<P>But especially God speaks with his Word by
his Spirit, when he sendeth his Spirit for <HI>Conver|sion,</HI>
and to effect a saving change: thus God
speaks when he calleth <HI>blind sinners</HI> out of dark|ness
into his marvellous light, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 9. quick|neth
<HI>dead sinners,</HI> putting into them a new Prin|ciple
of spiritual life, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 1. rescueth <HI>enslaved
sinners</HI> out of Satans snare, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 26. deliver|ing
them from the power of the Devil, and tran|slating
them into the Kingdome of his dear Son,
<HI>Col.</HI> 1. 13. when by his Spirit he draweth sinners,
<HI>Ioh.</HI> 6. 44. and joyns them unto Jesus Christ,
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 17. God speaketh unto men with his
Word by his Spirit, when he doth thus <HI>effectually
call them;</HI> and he speaketh unto men also by his
Spirit, when he <HI>graciously visiteth them</HI> which are
called, when he teacheth, melteth, warmeth,
quickneth, strengtheneth, and refresheth them by
his Spirit, as they sit under the influence of his
Ordinances, when he speaketh peace unto their
Consciences, sheweth them his reconciled Face,
sheddeth abroad his love in their hearts, and gi|veth
such sweet comforts and ravishing joy as is
unspeakable, and full of Glory, <HI>Ioh. 6. 45. Ioh.
14. 26. Luk. 24. 32. Psal. 143. 11. Eph. 3. 16. Act.
3. 19. Psa. 85. 8. Rom. 5. 5. Psa. 94. 19. 1 Pet.</HI> 1. 8.</P>
<P>2. God speaketh unto men by his <HI>Works;</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="9">
that either by his works of <HI>Creation,</HI> or by his
works of <HI>Providence.</HI></P>
<P>1. God speaketh by his works of <HI>Creation;</HI> the
Heavens have a voice and declare Gods glory,
<HI>Psa.</HI> 19. 1. and the Earth hath not only an ear to
hear, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1. 2. but also a tongue, as it were, to
speak Gods praise. We read of the Seas roaring,
and the Floods clapping their hands; of the
Mountains singing, and the Trees of the wood
sounding forth their joyful acclamations; yea,
beasts and all cattel, creeping things and flying
fowl, Dragons and all Deeps, Fire, Hail, Snow,
Rain, and stormy winde, as they fulfill his Word,
so they speak, and in their way declare what
their Maker is, or rather in them, and by them,
God doth speak, and make known something of
himself, <HI>Psa.</HI> 148. 7, 8, 10. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>We read of the</HI> Voice of the Lord in Power, the
Voice of the Lord in Majesty, the Voice of the
Lord upon the waters, the Voice of the Lord dividing
the flames of fire, the Voice of the Lord shaking the
Wilderness of <HI>Cadesh,</HI> breaking the Cedars of Leba|non,
<HI>and the like, which is the Voice of the Lord
in the terrible noise of Thunder,</HI> Psa. 29. 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>And there is no one work of the Lord (though
not with such a noise) which doth not with a loud
voice, as it were, in the Name of the Lord pro|claim
unto the Children of men, how great and
glorious the Lord is, who hath given it its being,
and use, and place in the world: especially the
work of God in the Make of man, his body the
members and senses, his Soul the powers and fa|culties,
doth <HI>without a tongue</HI> speak the praise of
<PB N="9" REF="9">
that God, who curiously framed the body in the
womb, and immediately infused the living soul,
<HI>Psa. 139. 14, 15. Zach.</HI> 12. 1.</P>
<P>2. God speaketh by his Works of <HI>Providence,</HI>
and that both <HI>merciful</HI> and <HI>afflictive.</HI></P>
<P>1. God speaketh by his <HI>Merciful Providen|ces,</HI>
by his patience, and bounty, and goodness, he
calleth men unto repentance, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 4. He gi|veth
witness of himself, in giving rain and fruit|ful
seasons, <HI>Act.</HI> 14. 17.</P>
<P>Gods <HI>providing</HI> mercies, Gods <HI>preventing</HI> mer|cies,
Gods <HI>preserving</HI> mercies, Gods <HI>delivering</HI>
mercies, the <HI>number</HI> of Gods mercies which can|not
be reckoned, the <HI>order</HI> and strange <HI>method</HI> of
Gods mercies, which cannot be declared, the
<HI>greatness</HI> of Gods mercies in the <HI>kinds</HI> and <HI>strange
circumstances,</HI> which cannot be expressed, do all
with <HI>open mouth</HI> call upon men from the Lord to
repent of their sins which they have committed
against him, and to yeild all love, thankfulness,
and obedience unto him.</P>
<P>2. God speaketh by his <HI>afflictive Providences:</HI>
There is a voice of God in his <HI>Rod,</HI> as well as in
his <HI>Word, Mic. 6. 9. Hear the Rod, and who hath ap|pointed
it;</HI> when God <HI>chasteneth,</HI> he <HI>teacheth, Psal.</HI>
94. 12. When God lifteth up his hand and strikes,
he openeth his mouth also and speaks; and some|times
openeth mens ears too, and sealeth their
instruction, <HI>Iob</HI> 33. 16.</P>
<P>Sometimes God speaks by <HI>Rods</HI> more <HI>mildly,</HI>
by lesser afflictions; sometimes God speaks by
<HI>Scorpions</HI> more <HI>terribly,</HI> by greater Judgements,
which leads to the second particular.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="10">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">2. What are those terrible things by which God doth
sometimes speak?</HEAD>
<P>THe word in the Original is <GAP DESC="foreign"> from
<GAP DESC="foreign"> which signifieth, he feared: Terrible
things are such great Judgements of God, as
do usually make a general impression of <HI>fear</HI> up|on
the hearts of people.</P>
<P>Take some instances.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The Plague is a Terrible Iudgement by which
God speaks unto men.</HI> The Hebrew word is
<GAP DESC="foreign"> from <GAP DESC="foreign"> he spake. It is a <HI>speaking</HI> Judge|ment;
where God sends the Plague, he speaks,
and he speaks terribly; the Plague is very terri|ble,
as it effecteth terrour; the <HI>Pestilence which
walketh in darkness,</HI> is called <HI>the Terrour by night,
Psal.</HI> 91. 5, 6.</P>
<P>The Plague is very <HI>terrible,</HI> in that</P>
<P>1. It is so <HI>poysonous</HI> a disease; it poysons the
blood and spirits, breeds a strange kind of ve|nom
in the body, which breaketh forth sometimes
in Boils, and Blains, and great Carbuncles, or
else works more dangerously, when it preyeth up|on
the vitals more inwardly.</P>
<P>2. It is so <HI>noysome</HI> a disease; it turns the good
humors into putrefaction, which putting forth it
self in the issues of running sores, doth give a
most noysome smell: Such a disease for loath|someness
we read of, <HI>Psa. 38. 5, 7, 11. My wounds
stink and are corrupt, my loins are filled with a
<PB N="11" REF="10">
loathsome disease, and there is no soundness in my
flesh; my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my
sore, and my Kinsmen stand afar off.</HI></P>
<P>3. It is so <HI>infectious</HI> a disease; it spreadeth it self
worse than the Leprosie amongst the <HI>Iews;</HI> it in|fecteth
not only those which are weak, and in|firm
in body, and full of ill humors, but also those
which are young, strong, healthful, and of the
best temperature; and that sometimes sooner
than others. The Plague is infectious, and greatly
infectious, whole Cities have been depopulated
through its spreading, many whole families have
received infection, and death one from another
thereby, which is the third thing that rendreth
the Plague so terrible.</P>
<P>4. It is so <HI>deadly;</HI> it kills where it comes with|out
mercy; it kills (I had almost said <HI>certainly</HI>)
very few do escape, especially upon its first en|trance,
and before its malignity be spent; few
are touched by it, but they are killed by it: and it
kills <HI>suddenly;</HI> as it gives no warning before it
comes, suddenly the arrow is shot which wound|eth
unto the heart; so it gives little time of pre|paration
before it brings to the Grave: Under o|ther
diseases men may linger out many weeks and
moneths; under some divers years; but the
Plague usually killeth within a few daies; some|times
within a few hours after its first approach,
though the body were never so strong and free
from disease before.</P>
<P>The Plague is very terrible; it is terrible to
them that have it; insomuch as it usually comes
with Grim Death, the <HI>King of Terrours,</HI> in its
hand: and it is terrible to them which have it
<PB N="12" REF="11">
not; because of their danger of being infected
by it; the fear of which hath made such an im|pression
upon some, that it hath rased out of their
hearts, for the while, all affections of love and
pitty to their nearest Relations and dearest
Friends; so that when the Disease hath first sei|zed
upon them, and they have had the greatest
need of succour, they have left their friends in
distress, and flown away from them, as if they
had been their Enemies.</P>
<P>2. <HI>A Deluge by Water is a Terrible Iudgement:</HI>
There have been several Floods which we read of
in Histories, that have suddenly broken in upon
some places, and overwhelmed Habitations and
Inhabitants together.</P>
<P>But God never did, and never will speak so
Terribly by a Deluge of Water, as by the great
Deluge in the daies of <HI>Noah,</HI> when the whole
world was drowned thereby, excepting <HI>Noah,</HI> and
those which were with him in the <HI>Ark.</HI></P>
<P>And because the Judgement was so dreadful,
and the History so affecting, I shall set it before
your eye out of <HI>Gen.</HI> 7. from the 11th ver. to the
end of the Chapter. <HI>In the six hundredth year of</HI>
Noahs <HI>life, in the second moneth, and the seventeenth
day of the moneth, in the same day were all the Foun|tains
of the Great Deep broken up.</HI> God withdrew
the bounds which he had set to the great Sea, so
that the waters covered the earth as they did at
the beginning; <HI>and the Windowes of heaven were
opened,</HI> out of which God <HI>looked forth in anger</HI>
upon the earth, and powered forth a <HI>Viol of his
wrath,</HI> causing it to rain forty daies and forty
nights in dreadful showres, accompanied, as is
<PB N="13" REF="11">
probable, with stormy winds, and hideous tem|pest,
which put the world into a fright and amaze|ment;
when the Element of Air seemed to be
changed into water, and such a <HI>Torrent</HI> flowed
in upon them on every side; we may guess what
fear they were over-whelmed withal; but <HI>Noah</HI>
and his Family were got into the Ark, and the
Lord <HI>shut them in; then the waters encreased, and
bare up the Ark, and it was lift up above the earth,
and the waters encreased, and prevailed great|ly
upon the earth, <GAP DESC="foreign">
and the Ark went upon the face of the waters, so that
all the high Hills and Mountains were covered fifteen
Cubits: Then all flesh died, fowl, and cattel, and
beast, and every thing that creeped or moved on the
earth, and every man, and</HI> Noah <HI>only remained
alive, and they that were with him in the Ark.</HI> God
spake then <HI>terribly indeed</HI> unto the wicked world
by the <HI>Flood,</HI> which devoured them all together in
the midst of their security and sin; but God
hath promised he will never speak thus by water
any more.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Fire is another terrible thing, whereby God
sometimes calls to contend by with a sinful People:</HI>
Fire is very dreadful when it hath a Commission
from God, and meets with much combustible
matter, and prevails without resistance. God
spake terribly by Fire unto <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI>
when he rained Fire and Brimstone on those Ci|ties,
and consumed them. See <HI>Gen.</HI> 19. from the
24th ver. to the 29th, <HI>The Lord rained fire and
brimstone out of heaven, and overthrew those Cities
and the Inhabitants together; and when</HI> Abraham
<HI>looked toward</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah, <HI>and the Land
<PB N="14" REF="12">
of the Plain, he saw the smoke of the Country go up
like the smoke of a Furnace.</HI></P>
<P>God spake terribly, though not so terribly to
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> when he suffered their City to be set
on fire by the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> and their Temple to be
burnt to the ground. See <HI>Ier.</HI> 52. 12, 13.</P>
<P>But the most fearful Instances of Gods Terri|ble
Voice by Fire are yet to come: Thus God
will speak by Fire unto <HI>Spiritual Babylon,</HI> which
may easily be proved to be <HI>Rome,</HI> from <HI>Rev.</HI> 17.
18. She being the then great City, which reigned
over the Kings of the earth. <HI>Babylons</HI> burning
with fire you may read, <HI>Rev.</HI> 18. 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.
<HI>Therefore shall her Plagues come in one day, Death,
and Mourning, and Famine, and she shall be ut|terly
burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who
judgeth her: And the Kings of the earth who have
committed fornication, and lived deliciously with her,
shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall
see the smoak of her burning; standing afar off for
fear of her torment, saying, Alas! alas! that great
City</HI> Babylon! <HI>that mighty City! for in one hour is
thy judgement come. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>God spake terribly by fire when <HI>London</HI> was in
flames, of which in the application; but he will
speak far more terribly when <HI>Babylon shall be in
flames;</HI> and not only in part, but wholly, and
utterly, and irreparably burnt and turned into
ashes: when not only the City shall be consu|med,
but also the Whore her self shall be hated
and made desolate, and devoured with fire by the
Kings of the earth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 10.</P>
<P>The last instance of Gods speaking terribly by
fire will be the <HI>last day,</HI> when the Lord Jesus
<PB N="15" REF="12">
Christ, the Judge of Quick and Dead, shall come
down from heaven in <HI>flaming fire, to take ven|geance
on all those that know not God, and obey not
the Gospel, 2 Thes.</HI> 1. 7, 8. And the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI>
tells us, that <HI>the heavens and the earth are reserved
in store for fire against this day:</HI> when <HI>the Heavens
shall pass away with a great noise, and the Elements
melt with fervent heat, and the Earth, and all the
works therein shall be burnt up, 2 Pet.</HI> 3. 7, 10. Then
God will speak terribly by fire, and above all,
most terribly to the ungodly world, when he
will sentence them unto, and cast them into the
<HI>Fire of Hell,</HI> where they must dwell with <HI>devou|ring
fire,</HI> and inhabit <HI>everlasting burnings.</HI></P>
<P>4. The Sword is a dreadful Iudgement, whereby
God speaks sometimes very terribly; <HI>especially
when he draws it forth against his own and his
peoples Enemies. Hear how terribly God speaks,
as in,</HI> Deut. 32. 39, 40, 41, 42. See now that I, even
I am he, and there is no God with me; I kill, and I
make alive; I wound, and I heal; neither is there
any that can deliver out of my hand: For I lift up
my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. If I
whet my glittering Sword, and my hand take hold on
Iudgement, I will render vengeance to mine Ene|mies,
and reward them that hate me; I will make
mine Arrows drunk with blood (and my Sword shall
devoure flesh) and that with the blood of the slain,
and of the Captives, from the beginning of revenges
upon the Enemies.</P>
<P>When God furbusheth his Sword, and whets
it; when God girdeth his Sword upon his thigh,
and marcheth against his Enemies; when he
draweth his Sword, and maketh slaughter with
<PB N="16" REF="13">
it; when his Sword devoureth much flesh, and is
made drunk with the blood of the slain; when
God gives Commission to the Sword, saying,
<HI>Sword, go thorow such a Land;</HI> as <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14. 17.
And <HI>powers out his fury on the Land in blood;</HI> as
ver. 19. So that the Sword is bathed in blood,
and garments are rowled in blood, and the Land
is soaked in blood; when blood is powred forth
like water, and dead bodies are cast forth into the
open field without burial; and God makes an in|vitation
to all feathered fowl to gather them|selves
together, and feast themselves upon the
carkasses of the slain; as <HI>Ezek.</HI> 39. 17, 18, 19,
20. When God comes with <HI>died garments from</HI>
Bozrah, <HI>Isa. 63. 1. When he gathereth the Nati|ons,
and brings them into the valley of</HI> Jehoshaphat,
<HI>and thither causeth his Mighty Ones to come down a|gainst
them, Ioel</HI> 3. 2. 11. When the day of Gods
indignation doth come, and he makes such
slaughter amongst his Enemies, that the Earth
doth stink with their carkasses, and the Moun|tains
do melt with their blood, <HI>Isa.</HI> 34. 2, 3.
When God <HI>treadeth the Wine-press of his wrath
without the City, and the blood comes out of the Wine-press
even to the horses bridles, Rev.</HI> 14. 20. In a
word, when the Lord shall come forth upon his
<HI>White Horse</HI> with his Armies, and shall destroy
the Beast, and all the Powers of the earth that
take part with him: as <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. from the 11th
ver. to the end: Then God will speak terribly
indeed against his Enemies by the Sword; then
he will <HI>roar</HI> out of <HI>Zion,</HI> and utter his voice from
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and that in such a manner, as will make
both the heavens and the earth to tremble, <HI>Ioel</HI>
3. 16.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="13">
And indeed God speaks with a Terrible Voice
where-ever he sends the Sword, and makes the
Alarm of War to be heard; as sometimes he
sends it amongst his own people for their sin,
1 <HI>Kings</HI> 8. 33.</P>
<P>When God brings into a Land a people of
another Language and Religion, of a fierce
countenance and cruel disposition, and gives
them power to prevail, and bring the Land under
their feet, so that the Mighty Men are cut off
by them, and the Men of Valour crushed in
the gate; the young men fly and fall before
them, and there is none to make any resistance;
when they break in upon Cities, plunder houses,
ravish Women and Maids, strip, and spoil, and
put all to the sword, the young, with the grey-head,
cruelly rip up women with-childe, and
without any pity on little Infants, dash them a|gainst
the stones. God speaks more terribly by
such a Judgement, than by Plague or Fire.</P>
<P>5. The Famine is a dreadful Iudgement, whereby
God speaks sometime unto a people very terribly; <HI>when
God</HI> stretcheth upon a place the lines of confusion, &amp; the
stones of emptiness; <HI>as</HI> Isa. 34. 11. <HI>When God
sendeth</HI> cleanness of teeth <HI>into</HI> Cities; <HI>as</HI> Amos 4.
6. <HI>When God shooteth into a Land the</HI> evil Ar|rows
of Famine, <HI>and it becomes exceeding sore,
this is one of the most dreadful Judgements of
all Judgements in this world, far beyond Plague,
or Fire, or Sword. See how pathetically the Fa|mine
amongst the</HI> Iews <HI>is described by</HI> Ieremiah
<HI>in his</HI> Lamentations, Chap. 4. <HI>from the 4th ver.
unto the</HI> 12. The tongue of the sucking Childe clea|veth
to the roof of his mouth f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">r thirst; the young
<PB N="18" REF="14">
Children ask for bread, and no man breaketh it
unto them. They that feed delicately are desolate in
the streets. They that were brought up in scarlet em|brace
dunghils. For the punishment of the iniquity of
the daughter of my people is greater than the punish|ment
of the sin of <HI>Sodom,</HI> that was overthrown in a
moment, and no hand stayed on her. The <HI>Nazarites</HI>
were purer than snow; whiter than milk; they were
more ruddy in body then Rubies; their polishing was
of saphire: their vtsage is blacker than a coal; they
are not known in the streets; their skin cleaveth to
their lones, it is withered, it is become like a stick.
They that be slain with the sword, are better than they
which be slain with hunger; for these pine away strick|en
through for want of the fruits of the Earth. The
hands of the pittiful women have sodden their own
Children, they were their meat in the destruction of
the daughter of my people. The Lord hath accom|plished
his fury, he hath poured out his fierce
anger.</P>
<P>6. The sixth terrible Iudgment is a Famine of
the Word, <HI>which is threatned,</HI> Am. 8. 11, 12.
Behold the dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will send
a Famine in the Land, not a Famine of Bread, nor
a thirst for Water, but of hearing the words of the
Lord: And they shall wander from Sea to Sea,
and from the North to the East, and they shall run
to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall
not finde it.</P>
<P>A Famine of the Word is a worse judgment,
than a Famine of Bread; indeed few do really
think so, because the most judge according to
sense; but that it is so, is evident to a <HI>Man of
faith and consideration;</HI> for as the soul is more ex|cellent
<PB N="19" REF="14">
than the body, and the concernments of
the other life, far beyond the concernments of this
life: so the provisions for the soul are more ex|cellent
than the provisions for the body, and the
means of getting eternal life to be preferred be|fore
the means of preserving temporal life;
and therefore by consequence the dearth &amp; scar|city
of provisions for the soul must needs be a
greater judgment, than a scarcity of provisions
for the body. Unto which I might add, that the
Famine of the word doth usually bring with it
many temporal judgments; The burning of the
Temple at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and the failing of Vision
was accompanied with slaughter by the sword,
and <HI>captivity</HI> of the Land.</P>
<P>7. <HI>And lastly, God speaks most terriblie unto
a people when he sends divers of these Iudgments to|gether,</HI>
as <HI>Lam. 1. 20. Abroad the sword bereaveth,
at home there is death,</HI> when enemies without,
Plague and Famine within. God speaks terribly,
when Fire and Sword goeth together, or Sword
and Famine; or Famine and Plague, or Famine
of Bread, and Famine of the Word.</P>
<P>These are some of the terrible things by which
God doth sometimes speak.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Why is it that the Lord doth speak unto a people 3.
by such terrible things?</HEAD>
<P>THe reason is, because people don't hearken
unto him, speaking any other way, God
<PB N="20" REF="15">
speaketh once, yea twice, but men perceive it not,
<HI>Iob</HI> 33. 14. Gods gentle voice is not heard or
minded, therefore he speaks more loudly and ter|ribly,
that people might be awakened to hear.
Particularly God speaks thus terribly,</P>
<P>1. <HI>Because People do not hearken to the voice of
his word and messengers;</HI> God speaks <HI>audibly</HI> by Mi|nisters,
and when they are not regarded, he speaks
more <HI>feelingly</HI> by judgments; he speaks first by
<HI>threatnings,</HI> &amp; when they are slighted, he speaks by
<HI>executions.</HI> God first lifts up his voice and warns
by his word, before he lifts up his arme and
strikes with his Rod; when men grow thick of
hearing the sweet calls of the Gospel, God is
even forced to thunder, that he may peirce their
ear; when God speaks to the ears and they are
shut, God speaks to the eyes and other senses,
that his mind may be known; especially when
men obstinately refuse to hear, God is exceed|ingly
provoked to execute his terrible judgments
upon them, see <HI>Zach. 8. 11, 12. But they refused
to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stop|ped
their ears that they should not hear: yea they
made their heart like an Adamant stone, least they
should hear the Law, and the words which the Lord of
Hosts had sent in his spirit by the former Prophets:
Therefore came there a great wrath from the Lord of
Hosts.</HI> So also when God gave up <HI>Ierusalem</HI> to
desolation and ruine, see the sin which provoked
the Lord hereunto. 2 <HI>Chron. 36. 16. They mock|ed
the messengers of God, and despised his words,
and misused his Prophets, untill the wrath of the
Lord arose against his people, till there was no re|medy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="15">
2. <HI>Because they do not hearken to the voice of his
goodness and mercies.</HI> The goodness and forbear|ance
of God doth speak unto men from him, and
call upon them to forbear sin for shame, to repent
and return to him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 4. But when men
despise the riches of his goodness, and deafen
their ear unto the language of his mercies, and
trample his patience under foot (though God
hath appointed a day of wrath hereafter, wherein
he will reckon with the whole ungodly World to|gether,
and give them the just demerit of their
sin, yet) sometimes his patience is turned hereby
into fury, and his anger doth break forth into a
flame, and consumes them by the blow of dread|full
temporal judgments.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Because they will not hearken to the voice of
lesser afflictions;</HI> when Gods word is not heard, he
speaks by his Rod; when his Rod is not heard, he
shoots with his arrowes &amp; strikes with his sword;
and if lesser afflictions be not minded, then God
speaks by more dreadful awakening judgments:
as the sins of men do precede the judgments of
God: so usually lesser judgments do precede
greater judgments; and as there are degrees
and steps which men usually do make before they
arrive to a great heighth in sin, <HI>Nemo repent&egrave; fit
turpissimus:</HI> so there are degrees and steps which
God usually doth take, in inflicting his judg|ments
for sin. Look into one place for all, which
shews how God doth proceed from less to great|er
judgments, <HI>Lev.</HI> 26. from the 15. <HI>v.</HI> to the
40<HI>th.</HI> when his statutes are despised and Cove|nant
broken, first he threatneth to send upon them
consumption, and a burning ague, then he threat|neth
<PB N="22" REF="16">
that they shall fall before their enemies;
and if they will not hearken to his voice in these
judgments, he threatneth to punish them seven
times more for their sins; and to make the Hea|vens
as Iron; and the Earth as brass; and send a
dearth amongst them. And if they will not yet
hearken, he threatneth to send wild beasts, which
should devour their children and Cattel. And if
they would not be reformed by these things, but
still would walk contrary unto him, he threatneth
to walk contrary unto them, and to punish them
yet seven times more for their sins: he threatneth
to bring a sword upon them to avenge the quar|rel
of his Covenant; and when they should be
gathered together in their Cities, to send the Pe|stilence
amongst them; and hereunto to adde the
Famine. And if they would not yet hearken
unto God, but still walk contrary unto him, he
threatneth that he will walk contrary unto them
in fury&punc; and make them eat the flesh of their Sons
and their Daughters, and lay wast their Cities,
and make their Sanctuaries a desolation; and up|on
them that are left alive he threatneth to send
such faintness of heart, that they should flee at
the sound of a shaken leaf, and fall when none
pursued them; and that they should pine away
in their iniquities in the Land of their enemies.
Thus God proceeds by steps and degrees in the
execution of his fierce anger upon a rebellious
People, when God speaks by ordinary diseases
and is not heard, then sometimes he sends a
Plague; and if after a Plague, people will not
return to him that smiteth them, nor seek to pa|cify
Gods anger which is kindled against them;
<PB N="23" REF="16">
but walk so much the more contrary unto him, he
may walk contrary to them in fury, and send
fire into their Cities to devour their habitations.
And if the voice of the Fire be not heard, he hath
other judgments in readiness, Sword&punc; Famine and
the like. And if temporal judgments be n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters"> heed|ed,
he will bring upon them eternal judg|ments.</P>
<P>God is not heard any other way, therefore he
doth speak by such terrible things.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Application.
God speaks sometimes to a People by terrible things.</HEAD>
<P>THese few last years have given sad instances
hereof in <HI>England,</HI> especially the two last
years in our City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The voice of the Lord hath been in the City,</HI> it
hath been loud and full of terrour; the Lord
hath come forth against us with armed venge|ance.
Frowns have been in his brow; death and
desolation in his looks; thunder hath been in his

hath gone before him, and burning Coals at his

and shewed the lighting down of his arme, with
the indignation of his anger: and with the flame
of devouring Fire, with scattering and tempest
and hail-stones: then the furrowes of the Earth
were seen, and the foundations of the City were
discovered, the Earth also shook, because he was
wrath, and the Inhabitants of <HI>London</HI> trembled,
because of his fierce anger;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 18. 45 7. 5.</NOTE> then the snares of
death compassed us, and the fears of hell gat
hold on us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa 7. 2.</NOTE> and our hearts were moved within us,
as Trees when they are moved by the Wind.
Dreadfull have Gods late judgments been in
<HI>London,</HI> the noise of which hath gone forth, not
only throughout the Land, but also unto the out|ermost
parts of the World.</P>
<P>Three things we should remark in this terri|ble
voice of Gods judgments.</P>

<ITEM>1. The Iudgments themselves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Cause of the Iudgments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Design of the Iudgments.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>In the first,</HI> we have the sound of the voice.</P>
<P><HI>In the two last,</HI> the Interpretation of the voice.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Concerning the Iudgments themselves.</HI> Here
I might speak of the judgment executed, <HI>Au|gust
24th</HI> 1662. when so many Ministers were
put out of their places; and the judgment exe|cuted
<HI>March 24th</HI> 1665. when so many Mini|sters
were banished 5. miles from Corporations,
the former by way of introduction to the Plague
which sometime after did spread in the Land, but
chiefly raged in the City; the later by way of in|troduction
to the Fire, which quickly after did
burn down <HI>London</HI> the greatest Corporation in
<HI>England.</HI> These judgments having been so lately,
<PB N="25" REF="17">
and general in the Land; and I presume so ge|nerally
known, with all their circumstances; that
it would be needless to give here a Narration of
them. But this I must say, I could wish they
were as generally believed to be judgments; and
accordingly laid to heart: for I fear that the
great insensibility, which people have been under
of these judgments; because they have not reach|ed
the <HI>Flesh;</HI> and their sottish inconsideration of
Gods dreadfull displeasure herein, hath provo|ked
the Lord to send such judgments as have
come nearer to <HI>sense:</HI> that they might perceive
God was <HI>angry</HI> indeed before, and that his <HI>great|er
displeasure</HI> in the former might be known by
his more <HI>sensible displeasure</HI> in the latter.</P>
<P>Let <HI>London</HI> seriously consider whether her <HI>Gos|pel
priviledges</HI> were not her best defence against
temporal calamities; and whether since her
slighting, abuse and forfeiture, and Gods seisure
and stripping her so much of these, she hath not
been laid naked to those heavy strokes of extraor|dinary
judgments which she hath lately re|ceived.</P>
<P><HI>London</HI> had the <HI>Gospel,</HI> Ordinances powerfull,
pure, plentifull Ministers excellently qualified
and rarely furnished with ministerial abilities;
<HI>London</HI> had as many burning and shining lights as
any one such spot of ground under the cope of
heaven.</P>
<P>Not to speak of their abilities for preaching
and defence of the truth, such gifts of prayer
<HI>London</HI> Ministers had, which were no small de|fence
of the City, as I believe no City in the
World could parallel.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="18">
O what <HI>prayers</HI> have there formerly been in
<HI>London</HI> Pulpits, especially on dayes of solemn
humiliation! how have the spirits of Ministers
been carried forth sometime in prayer for several
hours together, (without tautologies and vain
repetitions) in such variety of affectionate en|largements,
and with such raisedness and trans|ports
of spirit; as if they had been just leaving
the body, and going to live and abide with God,
and would converse no more with men or world|ly
things!</P>
<P>In their confessions of sin, how have they
rak'd into the dunghill of a rotten heart, and laid
abroad its inward filthiness? how have they trac'd
the foot-steps of its deceitfulness, through the
maze and wilderness of its many windings and
turnings? how have they peirced into the very
bowels of sin, and ript it up as it were to the
back-bone, bringing forth its very entrals to o|pen
view? how have they anatomiz'd as it were
the body of death in all the parts and members
of it, discovering withall the several diseases of
every part, with their cause, and manner of work|ing?
and all this in such pathetical cutting ex|pressions,
accompanied with such brokenness and
bleeding of heart, as no form can imitate or
effect.</P>
<P>In their supplications for the pardon of sin, for
spiritual and heavenly riches, O with what feel|ing
and fervour did they express themselves? O
with what faith and importunity did they wrestle
and plead at the Throne of Grace for such fa|vours
beyond the importunity of poor prisoners
through the grates, or poor beggars at the doors,
<PB N="27" REF="18">
when they are most earnest for relief? yea how
did they besiege God as it were, and seem as if
they would scale the walls of Heaven it self, and
take the Kingdome of Heaven with violence
and force? how have they even pressed in upon
God with the dint of argument, and laid hold
on him with the hand of faith, resolving not to
let him go without a blessing?</P>
<P>In their supplications for the Church and Land,
they have behaved themselves as if they had no
private concernments. But how did they bear
<HI>London</HI> upon their hearts when they came to the
throne of grace? what yearning bowels had they
towards and for the City? how many teares have
they shed in bewailing her sins? how have they
stood in the breach, when the Lord hath been
coming forth against this place? how have they
held his arme when it hath been lifted up to
strike? how have they stood <HI>weeping between the
Porch and the Altar, crying spare thy People O
Lord, and do not destroy London!</HI> and many times
have they prevailed to appease Gods wrath and
turn away his fierce anger which hath been kind|led
against us.</P>
<P><HI>Gospel-Ordinances,</HI> and <HI>Gospel-Ministers</HI> were
the safe-guard of <HI>London,</HI> the glory and defence.
But when the Ordinances were slighted, and the
Ministers were mocked and misused by some
who called themselves Professors, and both were
fallen so much in the esteem of the most; and
<HI>London</HI> did not yield the fruit which God looked
for under such dressing, (of which more when I
come to speak of <HI>Londons</HI> sins) God is provoked
not only to call for some of his Messengers home
<PB N="28" REF="19">
to himself, but also to suffer the rest which were
most consciencious to be thrust into Corners.</P>
<P><HI>This, this</HI> did presage <HI>London's</HI> near approach|ing
ruine and desolation, though few did believe
it, and because they did not believe it, and were
insensible of Gods wrath in this judgment:
therefore their danger was the greater of the o|ther
judgments which have come upon them:
when so many stakes were pluckt out, no wonder
if the hedge be broken; when so many Pillars
were removed, no wonder if the building tum|ble
to the ground.</P>
<P>But I proceed to give a narration of the later
judgments of Plague and Fire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Plague</HI> so great, so lately, should not be
forgotten; yet lest the fire more lately, and
propotionably more great, and the amazing fears,
which since have risen within us, should shuffle
former thoughts out of our minds, and rase out
the impressions, which by the Plague we had, and
should labour to retain to our dying hour: there|fore
I shall give a brief narration of this sad judg|ment,
and some observations of mine own (who
was here in the City from the beginning to the
end of it) both to keep alive in my self and others,
the memory of the judgment, that we may be
the better prepared for compliance with Gods
designe in sending the Plague amongst us.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="19">
It was in the year of our Lord 1665. that the
Plague began in our City of <HI>London,</HI> after we
were warned by the great Plague in <HI>Holland</HI> in the
year 1664. &amp; the beginning of it in some remote
parts of our Land the same year; not to speak
any thing whether there was any signification and
influence in the <HI>Blazing-star</HI> not long before,
that appeared in the view of <HI>London,</HI> and struck
some amazement upon the spirits of many: It
was in the moneth of <HI>May</HI> that the Plague was
first taken notice of; our Bill of Mortality did
let us know but of three which died of the disease
in the whole year before; but in the beginning of
<HI>May</HI> the bill tels us of nine, which fell by the
Plague, just in the heart of the City, the other
eight in the Suburbs. This was the first arrow of
warning that was shot from Heaven amongst us,
and fear quickly begins to creep upon peoples
hearts; great thoughts and discourse there is in
Town about the Plague, and they cast in their
minds whether they should go if the Plague
should increase. Yet when the next weeks Bill
signifieth to them the disease from 9 to 3. their
minds are something appeased; discourse of that
subject cools; fears are husht, and hopes take
place, that the black cloud did but threaten, and
give a few drops; but the wind would drive it
away. But when in the next Bill the number of
the dead by the Plague is mounted from 3 to 14,
and in the next to 17, and in the next to 43, and
the disease begins so much to increase, and di|sperse.</P>
<P>Now secure sinners begin to be startled, and
<PB N="30" REF="20">
those who would have slept at quiet still in their
nests, are unwillingly awakened. Now a great
consternation seizeth upon most persons, and
fearful bodings of a desolating judgment. Now
guilty sinners begin to look about them, and
think with themselves into what corner of the
Land they might fly to hide them. Now the profane
and sensual, if they have not remorse for their
sins; yet dread and terrors, the effects of guilt,
they could not drive from them; and if by com|pany,
and carousing, and soft pleasures they do
intoxicate and smoothen their spirits in the day;
yet we may guess what dread doth return upon
them if they give but any room for retirement,
and what hideous thoughts such persons have in
the silent night, through fears of death which they
are in danger of. Now those who did not believe
an unseen God, are affraid of unseen arrows; and
those which slighted Gods threatnings of eternal
judgments, do tremble at the beginning of his
execution of one, and not the greatest temporal
judgment. Now those which had as it were
challenged the God of Heaven, and defied him
by their horrid oaths and blasphemies, when he
begins to appear, they retreat, yea fly away with
terror and amazement. The great Orbs begin
first to move; the Lords and Gentry retire into
their Countries; their remote houses are prepa|red,
goods removed, and <HI>London</HI> is quickly
upon their backs: few ruffling Gallants walk
the streets: few spotted Ladies to be seen
at windows: a great forsaking there was of
the adjacent places where the Plague did first
rage.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="20">
In <HI>Iune</HI> the number increaseth from 43 to an
112. the next week to 168. the next to 267. the
next to 470. most of which increase was in
the remote parts; few in this month within, or
neer the walls of the City; and few that had any
note for goodness or profession, were visited at
the first: God gave them warning to bethink
and prepare themselves; yet some few that were
choice were visited pretty soon, that the best
might not promise to themselves a supercedeas,
or interpret any place of Scripture so literally, as
if the Lord had promised an absolute general
immunity and defence of his own people from
this disease of the Plague.</P>
<P>Now the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> are put to a stop
in the carrier of their trade; they begin to fear
whom they converse withall, and deal withall,
least they should have come out of infected
places. Now roses and other sweet flowers wi|ther
in the Gardens, are dis-regarded in the
Markets, and People dare not offer them to
their noses, lest with their sweet savour, that
which is infectious should be attracted: Rue
and Wormwood is taken into the hand; Myrrhe
and Zedoary into the mouth; and without some
antidote few stir abroad in the morning. Now
many houses are shut up where the Plague comes,
and the inhabitants shut in, lest coming abroad
they should spread infection. It was very dis|mal
to behold the red Crosses, and read in great
letters, <HI>Lord have mercy upon us,</HI> on the doors, and
Watchmen standing before them with Halberts,
and such a solitude about those places, and people
<PB N="32" REF="21">
passing by them so gingerly, and with such fear|ful
looks, as if they had been lined with enemies
in ambush, that waited to destroy them.</P>
<P>Now rich Tradesmen provide themselves to
depart, if they have not Country-houses, they
seek lodgings abroad for themselves and families,
and the poorer tradesmen, that they may imitate
the rich in their fear, stretch themselves to take a
Country journey, though they have scarce where|withall
to bring them back again. The Mini|sters
also many of them take occasion to go to
their Country places for the Summer time; or
it may be to find out some few of their Parishio|ners
that were gone before them, leaving the
greatest part of their flock without food or phy|sick,
in the time of their greatest need. (I don't
speak of all Ministers, those which did stay out
of choice and duty, deserve true honour) pos|sibly
they might think God was now preaching
to the City, and what need their preaching; or
rather did not the thunder of Gods voice affrigh|ten
their guilty consciences, and make them fly
away, lest a bolt from Heaven should fall upon
them, and spoil their preaching for the future: and
therefore they would reserve themselves, till the
people had less need of them. I do not blame
many Citizens retiring, when there was so little
trading, and the presence of all might have hel|ped
forward the increase and spreading of the
infection; but how did guilt drive many away,
where duty would have engaged them to stay in
the place? Now the high waies are thronged
with passengers, and goods, &amp; <HI>London</HI> doth emp|tie
it self into the Country; great are the stirs
<PB N="33" REF="21">
and hurries in <HI>London</HI> by the removal of so many
families; fear puts many thousands on the wing,
and those think themselves most safe, that can flie
furthest off from the City.</P>
<P>In <HI>Iuly</HI> the Plague encreaseth, and prevaileth
exceedingly, the number of 470. which died in
one week by the disease ariseth to 725 the next
week&punc; to 1089 the next, to 1843 the next, to 2010
the next. Now the Plague compasseth the walls of
the City like a flood, and poureth in upon it. Now
most Parishes are infected, both without and
within; yea there are not so many houses shut up
by the Plague, as by the owners forsaking of them
for fear of it; and though the Inhabitants be so
exceedingly decreased by the departure of so
many thousands, yet the number of dying per|sons
doth increase fearfully. Now the Coun|tries
keep guards, left infections persons should
from the City bring the disease unto them; most
of the rich are now gone, and the middle sort
will not stay behind; but the poor are forced
through poverty to stay and abide the storm.
Now most faces gather paleness, and what dis|mal
apprehensions do then fill the minds, what
dreadful fears do there possess the spirits, espe|cially
of those whose consciences are full of guilt,
and have not made their peace with God? the
old drunkards and swearers, and unclean per|sons
are brought into great straits; they look
on the right hand, and on the left, and death is
marching towards them from every part, and
they know not whither to flie that they may e|scape
it. Now the Arrows begin to flie very
<PB N="34" REF="22">
thick about their ears, and they see many fellow-sinners
fall before their faces, expecting every
hour themselves to be smitten; and the very sin|king
fears they have had of the Plague, hath
brought the Plague and death upon many: some
by the sight of a Coffin in the streets have fallen
into a shivering, and immediatly the disease hath
assaulted them, and Sergeant Death hath arrested
them, and clapt too the doors of their houses
upon them, from whence they have come forth
no more, till they have been brought forth to
their graves; we may imagine the hideous
thoughts and horrid perplexity of mind, the
tremblings, confusions, and anguish of spirit,
which some awakened sinners have had, when the
Plague hath broke in upon their houses, and sei|zed
upon neer relations, whose dying groans
sounding in their ears have warned them to pre|pare:
when their doors have been shut up and
fastned on the outside with an Inscription, <HI>Lord
have mercy upon us,</HI> and none suffered to come in
but a Nurse, whom they have been more afraid
of, then the Plague it self: when lovers and
friends, and companions in sin have stood aloof,
and not dared to come nigh the door of the house,
lest death should issue forth from thence upon
them; especially when the disease hath invaded
themselves; and first began with a pain and
diziness in their head, then trembling in their
other members; when they have felt boiles to
arise under their arms, and in their groins, and
seen blaines to come forth in other parts: when
the disease hath wrought in them to that height
as to send forth those spots which (most think)
<PB N="35" REF="22">
are the certain tokens of neer approaching
death; and now they have received the sen|tence
of death within themselves, and have cer|tainly
concluded, that within a few hours they
must go down into the dust; and their naked
souls, without the case of their body, must make
its passage into eternity, and appear before the
highest Majesty, to render their accounts, and
receive their sentence: None can utter the hor|rour,
which hath been upon the spirits of such,
through the lashes and stings of their guilty
consciences, when they have called to mind a
life of sensuality, and profaneness, their unclean|ness,
drunkenness, injustice, oaths, curses, deri|sion
of Saints, and holiness, neglect of their own
salvation; and when a thousand sins have been
set in order before their eyes, with another as|pect,
than when they looked upon them in the
temptation; and they find God to be irrecon|cileably
angry with them, and that the day of
grace is over, the door of mercy is shut, and
that pardon and salvation (which before they
slighted) is now unattainable; that the grave is
now opening its mouth to receive their bodies,
and hell opening its mouth to receive their souls;
and they apprehend, that they are now just en|tring
into a place of endless wo and torment, and
they must now take up their lodgings in the infe|riour
regions of utter darkness, with devils and
their fellow damned sinners, and there abide
for evermore in the extremity of misery, without
any hopes or possibility of a release; and that
they have foolishly brought themselves into this
condition, and been the cause of their own ruin;
<PB N="36" REF="23">
we may guess that the dispairful agonies, and
anguish of such awakened sinners hath been of
all things the most unsupportable; except the
very future miseries themselves, which they have
been afraid of.</P>
<P>In <HI>August</HI> how dreadful is the increase? from
2010 the number amounts up to 2817 in one
week; and thence to 3880 the next; thence
to 4237 the next; thence to 6102 the next;
and all these of the Plague, besides other diseases.</P>
<P>Now the cloud is very black, and the storm
comes down upon us very sharp. Now death
rides triumphantly on his pale horse through our
streets, and breaks into every house almost where
any inhabitants are to be found. Now people
fall as thick as leaves from the trees in Autumn,
when they are shaken by a mighty wind. Now
there is a dismal solitude in <HI>London</HI>-streets, every
day looks with the face of a Sabbath day, obser|ved
with greater solemnity than it used to be in
the City. Now shops are shut in, people rare
and very few that walk about, in so much that
the grass begins to spring up in some places, and
a deep silence almost in every place, especially
within the walls; no ratling Coaches, no pran|cing
Horses, no calling in Customers, nor offering
Wares; no <HI>London</HI> cries sounding in the ears;
if any voice be heard, it is the groans of dying
perions, breathing forth their last, and the fune|ral
knells of them that are ready to be carried to
their graves. Now shutting up of visited houses
(there being so many) is at an end, and most of
the well are mingled among the sick which other|wise
would have got no help. Now in some
<PB N="37" REF="23">
places where the people did generally stay; not
one house in an hundred but is infected; and in
many houses half the family is swept away; in
some the whole, from the eldest to the youngest;
few escape with the death of but one or two:
never did so many husbands and wives die toge|ther;
never did so many parents carry their chil|dren
with them to the grave, and go together
into the same house under earth; who had lived
together in the same house upon it. Now the
nights are too short to bury the dead, the whole
day though at so great a length is hardly suffici|ent
to light the dead that fall therein into their
beds.</P>
<P>Now we could hardly go forth, but we should
meet many coffins, and see many with sores, and
limping in the streets; amongst other sad specta|cles,
methought two were very affecting: one
of a woman comming alone, and weeping by the
door where I lived (which was in the midst of the
infection) with a little Coffin under her arm
carrying it to the new Church yard; I did judge
that it was the mother of the childe, and that all
the family besides was dead, and she was forced
to coffin up and bury with her own hands this
her last dead childe. Another, was of a man at
the corner of the Artillery-wall, that as I judge
through the diziness of his head with the disease,
which seised upon him there, had dasht his face
against the wall, and when I came by he lay
hanging with his bloody face over the rails, and
bleeding upon the ground; and as I came back
he was removed under a tree in More-fields, and
lay upon his back; I went and spake to him;
<PB N="38" REF="24">
he could make me no answer, but ratled in the
throat, and as I was informed, within half an
hour died in the place.</P>
<P>It would be endless to speak what we have
seen and heard of some in their frensie, rising
out of their beds, and leaping about their rooms;
others crying and roaring at their windows; some
comming forth almost naked, and running into
the streets, strange things have others spoken
and done, when the disease was upon them: But
it was very sad to hear of one who being sick
alone, and it is like phrantick, burnt himself in his
bed. Now the plague had broken in much a|mongst
my acquaintance; and of about 16. or
more whose faces I used to see every day in our
house, within a little while I could finde but 4.
or 6. of them alive; scarcely a day past over my
head for I think a moneth or more together,
but I should hear of the death of some one or
more that I knew. The first day that they were
smitten, the next day some hopes of recovery,
and the third day that they were dead.</P>
<P>The <HI>September,</HI> when we hoped for a decrease,
because of the season, because of the number
gone, and the number already dead; yet it was
not come to its height; but from 6102. which
died by the Plague the last week of <HI>August,</HI> the
number is augmented to 6988 the first week in
<HI>September;</HI> and when we conceived some little
hopes in the next weeks abatement to 6544; our
hopes were quite dashed again, when the next
week it did rise to 7165. which was the highest
Bill; And a dreadful Bill it was! and of the 130.
<PB N="39" REF="24">
Parishes in and about the City, there were but
4 Parishes which were not infected: and in
those, few people remaining that were not gone
into the Country.</P>
<P>Now the grave doth open its mouth without
measure. Multitudes! multitudes! in the valley
of the shadow of death, thronging daily into
eternity; the Church-yards now are stufft so
full with dead corpses, that they are in many pla|ces
swell'd two or three foot higher than they
were before; and new ground is broken up to
bury the dead.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Hell</HI> from beneath is moved at the
number of the guests that are received into its
chambers; the number of the wicked which have
died by the Plague, no doubt, hath been far the
greatest, as we may reasonably conclude without
breach of charity; and it is certain that all the
wicked, which then died in sin, were turned into
Hell; how then are the damned spirits now en|creased?
some were damning themselves a little
before in their oaths, and God is now damning
their souls for it, and is passing the irreversible
sentence of damnation upon them. Some were
drinking Wine in bowls a little before, and
strong drink without measure; and now God
hath put another cup into their hands, a cup of red
Wine, even the Wine of the wrath and fierce|ness
of the Almighty; some were a little before
feasting their senses, pleasing their appetite,
satisfying the desires of the flesh, and being past
feeling had given themselves up to lasciviousness,
to work all uncleanness with greediness; but now
their laughter is turned into mourning, and their
<PB N="40" REF="25">
joy into howling and woe; Now they have reco|vered
their feeling again, but instead of the
pleasures which they felt, and their sensual de|lights,
which took away the feeling of their con|sciences,
they are made to feel the heavy hand
of God, and to endure such anguish and horrour,
through the sense of Gods wrath, as no tongue
can express. Now the Atheists believe there is
a God, and the Anti-scripturists is convinced of
the truth of Gods Word, by the execution of
Gods threatnings in the Word upon them. Now
the covetous and unjust, the malicious and cruel,
the scoffers and profane begin to suffer the ven|geance
of eternal fire; and the ignorant person
with the civil, who are unacquainted with Jesus
Christ are not excused; yea the hypocrites, with
all impenitent, and unbelieving persons, are sent
down to the place of weeping: and surely hell
wonders to see so many come amongst them from
such a City as <HI>London,</HI> where they have enjoyed
such plenty of such powerful means of grace;
and place is given to them, even the lowest and
hottest, where <HI>Iudas</HI> and others are of the chiefest
note.</P>
<P>Yet Hell doth not engross all that dye by the
visitation; some there are (though not the first
or most) who have room made for them in the
mansions, which are above; the Plague makes
little difference between the righteous and the
wicked (except the Lord by a peculiar providence
do shelter some under his wing, and compass
them with his favour as with a shield, hereby
keeping off the darts that are shot so thick about
them) yet as there is little difference in the
<PB N="41" REF="25">
body of the righteous, and of others: so this di|sease
makes little discrimination, and not a few
fearing God, are cut off amongst the rest;
they dye of the same distemper, with the most
profane; they are buried in the same grave, and
there sleep together till the morning of the re|surrection:
but as there is a difference in their
spirits, whilst they live: so there is a difference
and the chiefest difference in their place and state
after their separation from the body. <HI>Dives</HI> is
carryed to Hell, and <HI>Lazarus</HI> to <HI>Abrahams</HI> bo|some,
though he dyed with his body full of sores:
Devils drag the souls of the wicked after they
have received their final doom at the Bar of God,
into utter darkness where there is weeping, and
wailing and gnashing of teeth: but Angels con|vey
the souls of the righteous into the heavenly
Paradise, the new <HI>Ierusalem</HI> which is above,
where God is in his glory; and the Lord Jesus
Christ at his right hand; and thousand thousands
stand before him, and ten thousand times ten
thousand administer unto him; even an innume|rable
company of Angels, and where the spirits
of all just men and women made perfect were
before gathered; where there is fulness of joy,
and rivers of eternal pleasures running about the
Throne of God, the streams of which do make
glad all the Inhabitants of new Jerusalem. Now
the weak prison doors of the body are broken
down; and the strong everlasting Gates of their
Fathers Palace are lifted up; and the Saints are
received with joy and triumph into glory, and
they come with singing into <HI>Zion,</HI> and everlast|ing
joy in their hearts, and all sorrow and sigh|ing
<PB N="42" REF="26">
doth fly away like a cloud, which never any
more shall be seen. Now the vail is rent, and
they enter the holy of holies, where God dwells,
not in the darkness of a thick cloud, as in the
Temple of old; but in the brightness of such
marvelous light and glory, as their eyes never
did behold, neither could enter into their heart
to conceive; there they have the vision of Gods
face, without any eclipse upon the light of his
countenance; there they have the treasures of
Gods love opened, and his armes to receive them
with dearest and sweetest embracements; which
kindles in their hearts such a flame of love, so
ravishing and delightful, as words cannot utter;
there they are entertained by the Lord Jesus
Christ, whom in the World they have served,
and he that shewed them his grace, which they
have wondred at, when they were in the body,
doth now shew them his glory, which they won|der
at much more: There they are welcomed
by Angels, who rejoyce if at their conversion,
much more at their coronation; there they sit
down with <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> in the
Kingdome of their Father; there they find
<HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and all
the holy Martyrs and Saints, which have dyed
before them, amongst whom they are numbred,
and placed, who rejoyce in their increased so|ciety.</P>
<P>And as there is a great difference between the
condition of the souls of the righteous, and the
wicked, who dyed by the same disease of the
Plague, after their death and separation, so there is
a great difference between the carriage of their
<PB N="43" REF="26">
spirits at their death, and upon their sick Bed.
Some wicked men are stupid and senseless, and
are given up to a judiciary hardness, and dye in a
sleep of carnal security, out of which they are
not awakened, till they are awakned in the midst
of flames: others more sensible, and considering
what hath been, and what is coming upon them,
are filled with unexpressible terrour, through the
roarings and tearings of a guilty accusing consci|ence,
and the fore-thoughts of that horrible un|supportable
torment they are so neer unto. Now
scaring dreams do terrifie them, and fearfulness
of the bottomless Pit, and the burning Lake be|low
doth surprize them, and some breaketh forth
in the anguish of their despairing souls; <HI>Who can
dwell with devouring Fire, who can inhabit ever|lasting
burnings?</HI> and however jovial and full of
pleasure their life hath been, yet at their latter end
they are utterly consumed with terrours. But
mark the perfect man, and behold the upright,
the end of that Man is peace, whatsoever storms
they have had in their passage through a rough
Sea, the wind blowing, and the waves roaring,
and sometimes have been ready to sink through
opposition and discouragement, sometimes have
been over-whelmed with grief and doubtings,
sometimes have been dasht upon the Rocks of
terrour, and perplexity: yet now they are come
to the haven of death, the Winds are husht and
still, the Waves are smooth and silent, the
storm is over, and there is a great calm upon their
spirits; they are past the Rocks, and are out of
the danger they feared, when they are in the
greatest danger of approaching death.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="27">
It was generally observed amongst us, that
Gods people who dyed by the Plague amongst
the rest; dyed with such peace and comfort, as
Christians do not ordinarily arrive unto, except
when they are called forth to suffer martyrdome
for the testimony of Jesus Christ. Some who
have been full of doubts, and fears, and com|plaints,
whilst they have lived, and been well;
have been filled with assurance, and comfort, and
praise, and joyful expectation of glory, when
they have layn on their death-beds with this di|sease.
And not only more grown Christians, who
have been more ripe for glory, have had these
comforts: but also some younger Christians,
whose acquaintance with the Lord hath been of
no long standing.</P>
<P>I can speak something of mine own knowledge
concerning some of my friends, whom I have
been withall; I shall instance only in the house
where I lived. We were eight in Family, three
Men, three Youths, an old Woman, and a maid:
all which came to me, hearing of my stay in
Town, some to accompany me, others to help
me. It was the latter end of <HI>September</HI> before
any of us were toucht; the young ones were not
idle, but improved their time in praying, and
hearing, and were ready to receive instruction;
and were strangly born up against the fears of the
disease and death, every day so familiar to the
view. But at last we were visited, and the Plague
came in dreadfully upon us, the Cup was put in|to
our hand to drink, after a neighbour Family
had tasted it, with whom we had much sweet so|ciety
in this time of sorrow. And first our Maid
<PB N="45" REF="27">
was smitten, it began with a shivering and tremb|ling
in her flesh, and quickly seised on her spi|rits;
it was a sad day, which I believe I shall ne|ver
forget; I had been abroad to see a friend in
the City, whose Husband was newly dead of the
Plague, and she her self visited with it; I came
back to see another, whose Wife was dead of the
Plague, and he himself under apprehensions
that he should die within a few hours; I came
home, and the Maid was on her Death-bed;
and another crying out for help, being left alone
in a sweating fainting fit. What was an interest
in Christ worth then? what a priviledge to have a
title to the Kingdom of Heaven?</P>
<P>But I proceed. It was the Monday when the
Maid was smitten; on Thursday she dyed full of
tokens; on Friday one of the Youths had a
swelling in his groin; and on the Lords day died
with the marks of the distemper upon him; on
the same day another Youth did sicken; and on
the Wednesday following he died: on the thurs|day
night his Master fell sick of the disease, and
within a day or two was full of spots; but strange|ly
beyond his own, and others expectations re|covered.
Thus did the Plague follow us, and
came upon us one by one; as <HI>Iob</HI>'s Messengers
came one upon the heels of another: so the Mes|sengers
of death came so close one after another,
in such dreadfull manner, as if we must all fol|low
one another immediately into the Pit. Yet
the Lord in mercy put a stop to it, and the rest
were preserved. But that which was very remark|able
in this Visitation, was the carriage especi|ally
of those Youths that died, who I believe
<PB N="46" REF="28">
were less troubled themselves, then others were
troubled for them. The first Youth that was vi|sited
being asked by his Father, concerning the
provision he had made for his death and eternity;
told him, he hop't if he died, he should go to
Heaven: being asked the grounds of his hopes,
said, the Lord had enabled him to look beyond
the World; and when he was drawing neer to
his end; boldly enquired whether the tokens
did yet appear, saying that he was ready for them;
and so a hopeful bud was nipt; but let not the
Father or the Mother weep, and be in sadness
for him, he is I don't doubt with their Father,
and his Heavenly Father, which may be their
comfort. The other also was a very sweet hope|full
Youth; so loving and towardly, that it
could not choose but attract love from those that
were acquainted with him. But the grace he had
gotten in those years, being I suppose under se|venteen,
did above all beautify him, and stand
him in the greatest stead: in his sickness he had
much quiet and serenity upon his spirit; and lay
so unconcerned at the thoughts of approaching
death, that I confess I marvelled to see it; the
sting and fear of death, were strangely taken out
through the hopes which he had of future glory;
yet once he told his Mother he could desire to live
a little longer, if it were the will of God; she
asked him why he desired it? he told her he desi|red
to live till fire and faggot came, and above all
he would fain die a Martyr: she said if he died
now he should have a Crown; he answered, but
if he died a Martyr he should have a more glo|rious
Crown: yet he was not unwilling to re|ceive
<PB N="47" REF="28">
his Crown presently; and went away with
great peace and sweetness in his looks, to his fa|thers
house: and I could not blame the Mothers
grief for the loss of such an only Son; but to be
so immoderate was not well; now I am sure it is
time to dry up tears, and lay aside sorrows for
the loss of him, who hath been so long filled with
joys in the heavenly mansions.</P>
<P>I might speak of the carriage of the master in
his sickness under the apprehensions of death;
when the spots did appear on his body, he sent
for me and desired me to pray with him; told
me he was now going home, desired me to write
to his friends, and let them know, that it did not
repent him of his stay in the City, though they
had been so importunate with him to come away:
but he had found so much of Gods presence in
his abode here, that he had no reason to repent:
he told me where he would be buried, and desired
me to preach his funeral Sermon on <HI>Psal. 16. ult.
In thy presence there is fulness of joy; and at thy right
hand there is pleasures for evermore.</HI> But the Lord
raised him again beyond the expectation of him|self,
friends, or Physician. Let him not forget
Gods mercies, and suffer too much worldly busi|ness
to croud in upon him, &amp; choak the remem|brance
and sense of God's goodness so singular;
but let him by his singularity in meekness, hu|mility,
self-denial, and love, zeal, and holy wal|king,
declare that the Lord hath been singularly
gracious unto him. But when I speak of home
concernments, let me not forget to look abroad;
the Plague now increaseth exceedingly, and fears
there are amongst us that within a while there
<PB N="48" REF="29">
will not be enough alive to bury the dead; and
that the City of <HI>London</HI> will now be quite depopu|lated
by this Plague.</P>
<P>Now some Ministers, formerly put out of
their places, who did abide in the City when
most of Ministers in place were fled and gone
from the people, as well as from the disease, into
the Countreys, seeing the people crowd so fast
into the grave and eternity, who seemed to cry
as they went for spiritual Physicians; and per|ceiving
the Churches to be open, and Pulpits to
be open, and finding Pamphlets flung about the
streets, of Pulpits to be let, they judged that
the Law of God and nature did now dispense
with, yea command their preaching in publick
places, though the Law of man (it is to be sup|posed
in ordinary cases) did forbid them to do it.
Surely if there had been a Law that none should
practise Physick in the City, but such as were li|cenc'd
by the Colledge of Physitians, and most of
those, when there was the greatest need of them,
should in the time of the Plague, have retired
into the Country, and other Physitians who had
as good skill in Physick, and no license should
have staid amongst the sick, none would have
judged it to have been breach of Law, in such an
extraordinary case to endeavour by their practise
though without a license, to save the lives of those
who by good care and Physick were capable of a
cure; and they could hardly have freed them|selves
from the guilt of murther of many bodies,
if for a nicety of Law in such a case of necessi|ty
they should have neglected to administer Phy|sick:
the case was the same with the unlicensed
<PB N="49" REF="29">
Ministers which stayed, when so many of the li|cenc'd
ones were gone, and as the need of souls
was greater than the need of bodies; the sick|ness
of the one being more universal and dange|rous,
than the sickness of the other; and the sa|ving
or losing of the soul being so many degrees
beyond the preservation or death of the body:
so the obligation upon Ministers was stronger,
and the motive to preach greater, and for them
to have incurred the guilt of soul-murther, by
their neglect to administer soul-physick, would
have been more hainous and unanswerable, that
they were called by the Lord into publick: I sup|pose
that few of any seriousness will deny, when
the Lord did so eminently own them, in giving
many seals of their Ministry unto them.</P>
<P>Now they are preaching, and every Sermon
was unto them, as if they were preaching their
last. <HI>Old Time</HI> seems now to stand at the head of
the Pulpit, with its great <HI>Sithe,</HI> saying with a
hoarse voice, <HI>Work while it is called to day, at
night I will mow thee down. Grim Death</HI> seems to
stand at the side of the Pulpit with its sharp <HI>ar|row,</HI>
saying, <HI>Do thou shoot Gods arrows, and I
will shoot mine.</HI> The <HI>Grave</HI> seems to lie open at
the foot of the Pulpit; with dust in her bosome,
saying,
<Q><L>Louden thy Cry</L>
<L>To God,</L>
<L>To Men,</L>
<L>And now fulfill thy Trust:</L>
<L>Here thou must lye,</L>
<L>Mouth stopt,</L>
<L>Breath gone,</L>
<L>And silent in the Dust.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="30">
Ministers now had awakning calls to serious|ness
and fervour in their ministeriall work: to
preach on the side and brink of the Pit, into
which thousands were tumbling; to pray under
such neer views of eternity, into which many
passengers were daily entring, might be a means
to stir up the spirit more than ordinary.</P>
<P>Now there is such a vast concourse of people
in the Churches, where these Ministers are to be
found, that they cannot many times come neer
the Pulpit doors for the press, but are forced to
climb over the pews to them: And such a face is
now seen in the Assemblies, as seldome was seen
before in <HI>London;</HI> such eager looks; such open ears,
such greedy attention, as if every word would be
eaten, which dropt from the mouths of the Mi|nisters.</P>
<P>If you ever saw a drowning Man catch at a rope,
you may guess how eagerly many people did
catch at the Word; when they were ready to be
overwhelmed by this over-flowing scourge, which
was passing thorough the City; when death was
knocking at so many doors; and God was crying
aloud by his judgments; and Ministers were
now sent to knock, cry aloud, and lift up their
voice like a Trumpet: <HI>then, then</HI> the people be|gan
to open the ear and the heart, which were
fast shut and barred before: How did they then
hearken, as for their lives; as if every Sermon
were their last; as if death stood at the door of
the Church, and would seize upon them so soon
as they came forth; as if the arrows which flew
so thick in the City would strike them, before
they could get to their houses; as if they were
<PB N="51" REF="30">
immediately to appear before the Barr of that
God, who by his Ministers was now speaking unto
them. Great were the impressions which the Word
then made upon many hearts, beyond the power
of Man to effect, and beyond what the people be|fore
ever felt, as some of them have declar'd.
When sin is ript up and reprov'd, O the teares
that slide down from the eyes! when the judg|ments
of God are denounced, O the tremblings
which are upon the conscience! when the Lord
Jesus Christ is made known and proffer'd, O
the longing desires and openings of heart unto
him! when the riches of the Gospel are displayed,
and the promises of the Covenant of grace are
set forth and applyed, O the inward burnings and
sweet flames which were on the affections! now
the Net is cast, and many fishes are taken; the
Pool is moved by the Angel, and many leprous
spirits, and sin-sick-souls are cured; many were
brought to the birth, and I hope not a few were
born again, and brought forth; a strange moving
there was upon the hearts of multitudes in the
City; and I am perswaded that many were
brought over effectually unto a closure with Je|sus
Christ; whereof some dyed by the Plague
with willingness and peace; others remain sted|fast
in Gods wayes unto this day: but convicti|ons
(I believe) many hundreds had, if not thou|sands,
which I wish that none have stifled, and
with the Dog returned to their vomit, &amp; with the
Sow, have wallowed again in the mire of their
former sins. The work was the more great, be|cause
the instruments, which were made use of
was more obscure, and unlikely, whom the Lord
<PB N="52" REF="31">
did make choice of the rather, that the glory by
Ministers and people might be ascrib'd in full
unto himself.</P>
<P>About the beginning of these Ministers preach|ing,
especially after their first Fast together, the
Lord begins to remit, and turn his hand, and
cause some abatement of the disease.</P>
<P>From 7155 which dyed of the Plague in one
week&punc; there is a decrease to 5538 the next, which
was at the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> the next week
a farther decrease to 4929. the next to 4327. the
next to 2665. the next to 1421. the next to 1021.
then there was an encrease the first week in <HI>No|vember</HI>
to 1414. but it fell the week after to 1050
and the week after to 652. and the week after
that to 333. and so lessened more and more to
the end of the year: when we had a Bill of
97306. which dyed of all diseases, which was an
encrease of more then 79000, over what it was
the year before: and the number of them which
dyed by the Plague was reckoned to be 68596
this year; when there were but 6 which the Bill
speaks of who dyed the year before.</P>
<P>Now the Citizens, who had dispers'd them|selves
abroad into the Countries, because of the
Contagion, think of their old Houses and Trades,
and begin to return, though with fearfulness and
trembling, least some of the after-drops of the
storm should fall upon them: and O that many
of them had not brought back their old hearts
and sins&punc; which they carryed away with them;
O that there had been a general repentance and
reformation, and returning to the Lord that had
smitten the City: The Lord gave them leisure
<PB N="53" REF="31">
and Vacation from their Trades; for the one ne|cessary
thing&punc; which had they improved, and gene|rally
mourned for sin, which brought the plague
upon the City, had they humbly and earnestly
sought the Lord to turn from his fierce anger,
which was kindled against <HI>London,</HI> it might have
prevented the desolating judgment by Fire: But
alas! how many spent their time of leisure in toys
and trifles, at best about feeding and preserving
their bodies, but no time in serious minding the
salvation of their souls; and if, some were a lit|tle
awakned with fear, whilst the plague raged
so greatly, and they lookt upon themselves to be
in such danger; yet when they apprehended the
danger to be over, they dropt asleep faster than
before; still they are the same or worse than for|merly:
They that were drunken, are drunken
still; they that were filthy, are filthy still; and
they that were unjust and covetous, do still per|severe
in their sinfull course; couzenilng, and ly|ing,
and swearing, and cursing, and Sabbath-breaking,
and pride, and envy, and flesh-plea|sing,
and the like God-displeasing, and God-provoking
sins, (of which in the Catalogue of
<HI>London</HI>'s sins) do abound in <HI>London;</HI> as if there
were no signification in Gods judgments by the
Plague; some return to their Houses, and fol|low
their worldly business, and work as hard as
they can to fetch up the time they have lost,
without minding and labouring to improve by
the Judgment, and Gods wonderfull preservation
of them: others return, and sin as hard as they
can, having been taken off for a while from those
opportunities and free liberties for sin, which
<PB N="54" REF="32">
they had before: most began now to sit down at
rest in their houses when the Summer was come,
and the Plague did not return; now they bring
back all their Goods they had carried into the
Country because of the Plague; they did not
imagine they should be forced to remove them
again so soon.</P>
<P>Thus concerning the great Plague in <HI>London.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<P>I Proceed now to give a Narration of the judge|ment
of the Fire; in which I shall be more
brief, it being dispatcht in fewer daies then the
Plague was in months.</P>
<P>It was the 2. of <HI>September</HI> 1666. that the an|ger
of the Lord was kindled against <HI>London,</HI> and
the Fire began: It began in a Bakers house in
<HI>Pudding-lane</HI> by <HI>Fishstreet-hill:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psa. 21. 9.</NOTE> and now the Lord
is making <HI>London like a fiery Oven in the time of his
anger,</HI> and in his wrath doth devour and swallow
up our habitations. It was in the depth and dead
of the night, when most doors and&punc; sences were
lockt up in the City; that the Fire doth break forth
and appear abroad; and like a mighty Gyant
refresht with Wine, doth awake and arm it self,
quickly gathers strength, when it had made
havock of some houses; rusheth down the hill
towards the <HI>Bridge;</HI> crosseth <HI>Thames-street,</HI> in|vadeth
<HI>Magnus-Church</HI> at the <HI>Bridge foot,</HI> and
though that Church were so great, yet it was
not a sufficient Barracado against this Conqueror;
<PB N="55" REF="32">
but having scaled and taken this Fort, it shooteth
flames with so much the greater advantage into all
places round about; and a great building of houses
upon the, <HI>Bridge is</HI> quickly thrown to the ground:
Then the Conquerour, being stayed in his course
at the <HI>Bridge,</HI> marcheth back towards the City
again; and runs along with great noise and
violence through <HI>Thames-street.</HI> Westward, where
having such combustible matter in its teeth, and
such a fierce Winde upon its back, it prevails
with little resistance, unto the astonishment of
the beholders.</P>
<P>My business is not to speak of the hand of
man; which was made use of in the beginning
and carrying on of this Fire. The beginning of
the Fire at such a time, when there had been so
much hot weather, which had dried the houses,
and made them: the more fit for fuel; the
beginning of it in such a place, where there
were so many Timber houses, and the shops fil|led
with so much combustible matter; and the
beginning of it just when the Winde did blow so
fiercely upon that corner towards the rest of the
City, which then was like Tinder to the Sparks;
this doth smell of aPopish design so hatcht in the
same place where the Gunpowder plot was con|triv'd,
only that this was more successful. The
world sufficiently knows how correspondent this
is to Popish principles and practises; those, who
could intentionally blow up King and Parlia|ment
by Gunpowder, might (without any
scruple of their kinds of conscience) actually
burn an heretical City (as they count it) into
ashes: for besides the Dispensations they can
<PB N="56" REF="33">
have from his Holiness, or rather his Wicked|ness
the Pope, for the most horrid crimes of Mur|der,
Incest, and the like; It is not unlikely but they
count such an action as this meritorious (in their
kind of merit) which, in the issue, they will finde
to merit the flames of eternal Fine, instead of a
Crown of Glory, which I wonder that in their
way they can have the least hopes of. I believe
that the people will now take more heed of them
and their waies; and instead of promoting their
cause, I hope that a contrary effect is produced;
and that the before Indifferency of a generation
more newly sprung up, who did not know them,
is now turned into loathing and detestation of
such a religion, as can allow of such practises&punc;
My work is not to declare what hath been proved
against the Papists before the Honourable Com|mittee
of Parliament appointed to enquire into
their insolencies; and the proofs which have been
given in concerning the Fire, and who have been
accessory thereunto.</P>
<P>No, I would rather endeavour to turn peoples
eyes from men to God; for whoever were the
instruments, God was the Authour of this evil,
which hath come upon us; there being no evil in
the City (that is, evil of punishment) which
the Lord, as a righteous, and the supream Judge,
doth not inflict. And surely more of the extra|ordinary
hand of God, than of any men, did
appear in the burning of the City of <HI>London.</HI> God
could have prevented men, by discovering their
plots (as he did that of the Gun powder-treason)
before they had taken effect. God could have
directed and given a blessing unto means for
<PB N="57" REF="33">
the quenching of it when it was first kindled.
God, who hath the winds in his Fist, could have
gathered in the Wind, and laid it asleep, or so
turned it the other way, that it should have been a
defence to the City&punc; or God who hath the Clouds
at his command, and the Bottles of Heaven in his
hand, could have gathered his thick Clouds to|gether,
and squeez'd them; opend his Bottles,
and poured down Rain in abundance upon the
City, so that if the wind had blown as it did,
it should have blown water upon the fire, which
would quickly have put it out. But the Heavens
at that time were Brass, no showring Clouds to
be seen: the Fire begins, is quickly taken notice
of, though in the midst of the night; <HI>Fire, Fire,
Fire</HI> doth resound the streets; many Citizens
start out of their sleep; look out of their win|dows;
some dress themselves, and run to the
place. The Lord Maior of the City comes with
his Officers; a confusion there is: councell is
taken away: and <HI>London,</HI> so famous for wis|dom
and dexterity, can now find neither brains,
nor hands to prevent its ruine. The hand
of God was in it&punc; The Decree was come forth:
<HI>London</HI> must now fall: and who could prevent
it? No wonder, when so many Pillars are remo|ved,
if the Building tumbles; the prayers, tears,
and faith which sometimes <HI>London</HI> hath had,
might have quenched the violence of the fire;
might have opened Heaven for rain, and driven
back the winde: but now the fire gets mastery, &amp;
burns dreadfully; and God with his great Bel|lows
blowes upon it, which makes it spread
quickly, &amp; go on with such force and rage, over|turning
<PB N="58" REF="34">
all so furiously, that the whole City is
brought into jeopardy of desolation. That night
most of the Londoners had taken their last sleep
in their houses; they little thought it would be
so when they went into their beds; they did not
in the lest suspect, when the doors of their ears
were unlockt, and the casement of their eyes
were opened in the morning, to hear of such
an enemies invading the City&punc; and that they
should see him, with such fury, enter the doors
of their houses, break into <UNCLEAR>every</UNCLEAR> room, and
look out of their casements with such a threat|ning
countenance. As it is said, Lam. 4. 12. <HI>The
inhabitants would not have believed that the adver|sary
should have entered the gates of Ierusalem:</HI> so
the Inhabitants of the City would not have be|lieved
that the Fire should have entred and pre|vailed
to burn <HI>London</HI> to the ground.</P>
<P>That which made the ruin the more dismall,
was, that it was begun on the <HI>Lords day</HI> morning:
never was there the like Sabbath in <HI>London;</HI>
some Churches were in flames that day; and
God seems to come down, and to preach him|self
in them, as he did in Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> when the
Mount burned with Fire; such warmpreaching
those Churches never had; such Lightning dread|ful
Sermons never were before delivered in <HI>Lon|don.</HI>
In other Churches Ministers were preach|ing
their Farewel Sermons, and people were
hearing with quaking and astonishment: In|stead
of a holy <HI>Rest</HI> which Christians have taken
on this day; there is a tumultuous hurrying about
the streets towards the place that burned, and
more tumultuous hurrying upon the spirits of
<PB N="59" REF="34">
those that sat still and had only the notice of the
eare, of the quick and strange spreading of the Fire.</P>
<P>Now the Train-bands are up in Arms watch|ing
at every quarter for Outlandish men, be|cause
of the general fears and jealousies, and
rumours that Fire-Balls were thrown into houses
by several of them, to help on and provoke the too
furious flames. Now Goods are hastily removed
from the lower parts of the City; and the body
of the people begin to retire, and draw upwards,
as the people did from the Tabernacles of <HI>Co|rah,
Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 16. 27, 31, 32.</NOTE> when the earth did cleave
asunder and swallow them up:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 19.</NOTE> or rather as <HI>Lot</HI>
drew out from his house in <HI>Sodom</HI> before it was
consumed by fire from Heaven. Yet some
hopes were retained on the Lords day that the
Fire would be extinguished, especially by them
who lived in the remote parts; they could
scarcely imagine that the Fire a mile off should
be able to reach their houses.</P>
<P>But the evening draws on, and now the Fire
is more visible and dreadful: instead of the <HI>Black</HI>
curtains of the night, which used to be spread
over the City, now the curtains are <HI>Yellow;</HI> the
smoke that arose from the burning parts, seemed
like so much flame in the night, which being
blown upon the other parts by the winde, the
whole City at some distance seemed to be on
fire. Now hopes begin to sink, and a general
consternation seiseth upon the spirits of people;
little sleep is taken in <HI>London</HI> this night; the
amazement which the eye and ear doth effect
upon the spirit, doth either dry up, or drive away
the vapour which used to binde up the senses,
<PB N="60" REF="35">
Some are at work to quench the fire with water;
others endeavour to stop its course, by pulling
down of houses; but all to no purpose: if it be a
little allayed, or beaten down, or put to a stand
in some places, it is but a very little while; it
quickly recruits, and recovers its force; it leaps,
and mounts, and makes the more furious onset,
drives back its opposers, snatcheth their weapons
out of their hands, seiseth upon the Water-houses
and Engines, burns them, spoils them, and
makes them unfit for service. Some are upon
their knees in the night, pouring out tears be|fore
the Lord, interceding for poor <HI>London,</HI> in
the day of its calamity; but alas I fear there are
too few weeping <HI>Ieremiah's</HI> at the throne of grace:
too few <HI>Moses's</HI> to stand in the gap, too few <HI>Ia|cob's</HI>
to wrestle with the Lord, and hang about his
arm. <HI>Londons</HI> sins were too great, and Gods anger
against the City was too hot, so easily &amp; present|ly
to be quenched and allayed; and if by the
intercession of some, a mitigation be obtained, so
that the Lord doth not stir up all his wrath, ut|terly
to destroy the place, as he did <HI>Sodom</HI> and
<HI>Gomorrah;</HI> yet none can prevaile to call back
that wrath, and reverse that decree which is gone
forth against the City: The time of <HI>Londons</HI> fall
is come; the Fire hath received its commission
from God to burn down the City, and therefore
all attempts to hinder it are in vain.</P>
<P>On the Lords day night the Fire had run as far
as <HI>Garlick-hithe</HI> in <HI>Thames-street,</HI> and had crept up
into <HI>Cannon-street,</HI> and levell'd it with the ground;
and still is making forward by the water-side, and
upward to the brow of the hill, on which the City
was built.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="35">
On <HI>Munday Grace-church-street</HI> is all in flames,
with <HI>Lumbard-street</HI> on the left hand, and part of
<HI>Fen-church-street</HI> on the right, the Fire working
(though not so fast) against the winde that way:
before it were pleasant and stately houses, behind
it ruinous and desolate heaps. The burning then
was in fashion of a <HI>Bow,</HI> a dreadful Bow it was,
such as mine eyes never before had seen; a Bow
which had Gods <HI>Arrow</HI> in it with a flaming point;
It was a shining Bow; not like that in the cloud,
which brings water with it, and withall signi|fied
Gods Covenant not to destroy the world any
more with water: but it was a Bow which had
Fire in it, which signified Gods anger, and his in|tention
to destroy <HI>London</HI> with Fire.</P>
<P>Now the Flames break in upon <HI>Cornhill,</HI> that
large and spacious street, and quickly crosse
the way by the train of Wood that lay in the
streets untaken away, which had been pull'd
down from houses to prevent its spreading: and
so they lick the whole street as they go: they
mount up to the top of the highest houses; they
descend down to the bottom of the lowest vaults
and cellars; and march along on both sides of
the way, with such a roaring noise, as never
was heard in the City of <HI>London;</HI> no stately buil|ding
so great, as to resist their fury: the Royal
Exchange it self, the glory of the Merchants, is
now invaded with much violence; and when
once the fire was entred, how quickly did it run
round the Galleries, filling them with flames;
then came down staires, compasseth the walkes,
giving forth flaming volleys, and filleth the court
with sheets of Fire; by and by down fall all the
<PB N="62" REF="36">
<HI>Kings</HI> upon their faces, and the greatest part of
the stone-building after them, (the Founders sta|tue
only remaining) with such a noise, as was
dreadful and astonishing.</P>
<P><HI>Then, then</HI> the City did shake indeed; and the
inhabitants did tremble, and flew away in great
amazement from their houses, least the flames
should devour them; <HI>Ratle, ratle, ratle,</HI> was the
noise which the Fire struck upon the eare round
about, as if there had been a thousand Iron
Chariots beating upon the stones: and if you o|pened
your eye to the opening of the streets,
where the Fire was come, you might see in some
places whole streets at once in flames, that issu|ed
forth, as if they had been so many great Forges
from the opposite windowes, which folding to|gether,
were united into one great flame through|out
the whole street; and then you might see the
Houses <HI>tumble, tumble, tumble,</HI> from one end of
the street to the other with a great crash, leaving
the foundations open to the view of the hea|vens.</P>
<P>Now fearfulness and terrour doth surprize the
Citizens of <HI>London;</HI> confusion and astonishment
doth fall upon them at this unheard of, unthought
of Judgment. It would have grieved the heart,
of an unconcern'd person, to see the rufull looks,
the pale cheeks, the tears trickling down from
the eyes, (where the greatness of sorrow and a|mazement
could give leave for such a vent) the
smiting of the brest, the wringing of the hands;
to hear the sighs and groans, the dolefull and
weeping speeches of the distressed Citizens, when
they were bringing forth their wives (some from
<PB N="63" REF="36">
their child bed) and their little ones (some from
their sick bed) out of their houses, and sending
them into the Countreys, or some where into
the Fields with their goods. Now the hopes of
<HI>London</HI> are gone, their heart is sunk; now there
is a general remove in the City, and that in a
greater hurry than before the Plague; their goods
being in greater danger by the Fire, than their
persons were by the sickness. Scarcely are some
returned, but they must remove again, and not
as before, now without any more hopes of ever
returning, and living in those houses any more.</P>
<P>Now Carts, and Draies, and Coaches, and Hor|ses,
as many as could have entrance into the Ci|ty
were loaden, and any money is given for help
5 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>l.</HI> 20 <HI>l.</HI> 30 <HI>l.</HI> for a Cart, to bear forth
into the Fields some choice things, which were
ready to be consumed; and some of the Coun|treys
had the conscience to accept of the highest
price, which the Citizens did then offer in their
extremity; I am mistaken if such money do not
burn worse, than the Fire out of which it was
<HI>rak'd.</HI> Now Casks of Wine, and Oyl, and o|ther
commodities are tumbled along, and the
owners shove as much of their goods as they can
towards the Gate: every one now becomes a
Porter to himself, and scarcely a back either of
Man or Woman that hath strength, but had a
burden on it in the streets: It was very sad to
see such throngs of poor Citizens coming in,
and going forth from the unburnt parts, heavy
loaden with some pieces of their goods, but more
heavy loaden with weighty grief and sorrow of
heart, so that it is wonderfull they did not quite
sink under these burdens.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="37">
<HI>Munday</HI> night was a dreadfull night, when
the wings of the night had shadowed the light
of the heavenly bodies, there was no darkness of
night in <HI>London,</HI> for the Fire shines now round
about with a fearful <HI>Blaze,</HI> which yeilded such
light in the streets, as it had been the Sun at
noon day. Now the Fire having wrought back|ward
strangely against the Winde to <HI>Billings-Gate,</HI>
&amp;c. along <HI>Thames-Street</HI> Eastward, runs up
the hill to <HI>Tower-Street,</HI> and having marched on
from <HI>Grace-Church-Street,</HI> maketh further pro|gress
in <HI>Fen-Church-Street,</HI> and having spread
its wing beyond <HI>Queen-hithe</HI> in <HI>Thames-Street</HI>
Westward, mounts up from the Water-side
through <HI>Dowgate,</HI> and <HI>old Fish-street</HI> into <HI>Watling-street:</HI>
but the great fury of the Fire was in the
broader Streets; in the midst of the night it was
come down <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and laid it in the dust, and
runs along by the <HI>Stocks,</HI> and there meets with a|nother
Fire, which came down <HI>Thred-needle-street;</HI>
a little further with another, which came up from
<HI>Wall-brook;</HI> a little further with another, which
comes up from <HI>Bucklers-bury,</HI> and all these four
joyning together, break into one great flame at
the corner of <HI>Cheap-side</HI> with such a dazling light,
and burning heat, and roaring noise by the fall of
so many houses together, that was very amazing;
and though it were something stopt in its swift
course at <HI>Mercers</HI> Chappel, yet with great force
in a while, it conquers the place, and burns
through it, and then with great rage proceedeth
forward in <HI>Cheapside.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> was the Fire burning up the very
bowels of <HI>London; Cheapside</HI> is all in a light fire
<PB N="65" REF="37">
in a few hours time) many Fires meeting there,
as in the center; from <HI>Soper-lane, Bow-lane, Bread-street,
Friday-street,</HI> and <HI>Old-change,</HI> the Fire
comes up almost together, and breaks furiously
into the Broad-street, and most of that side of
the way was together in flames, a <HI>dreadful spe|ctacle!</HI>
and then partly by the Fire which came
down by <HI>Mercers Chappel,</HI> partly by the fall of
the Houses cross the way, the other side is quick|ly
kindled, and doth not stand long after it. Now
the Fire gets into <HI>Black-fryers,</HI> and so continues
its course by the water, and makes up towards
<HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Church,</HI> on that side, and <HI>Cheap-side</HI> Fire
besets the great building on this side, and the
Church though all of stone outward, though na|ked
of houses about it, and though so high above
all buildings in the City, yet within a while, doth
yield to the violent assaults of the conquering
flames, and strangely takes Fire at the top; now
the lead melts and runs down, as if it had been
snow before the Sun; and the great beames and
massy stones, with a great noise fall on the Pave|ment,
and break through into Faith-Church un|der
neath; now great flakes of stone scale, and
peel off strangely from the side of the Walls;
the Conqueror having got this high Fort, darts its
flames round about, now <HI>Pater-noster-rowe, New|gate-market,</HI>
the <HI>old Baily,</HI> and <HI>Ludgate-hill</HI> have
submitted themselves to the devouring Fire,
which with wonderful speed rusheth down the
Hill into <HI>Fleet-street.</HI> Now <HI>Cheap-side</HI> Fire march|eth
along <HI>Iron-monger-lane, old Iury, Lawrence-lane,
Milk-street, Wood-street, Gutter-lane, Foster-lane:</HI>
Now it runs along <HI>Lothbury, Cat-eaten-street,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="38">
&amp;c. From <HI>Newgate-Market,</HI> it assaults
<HI>Christ-Church,</HI> and conquers that great building,
and burns through <HI>Martin</HI>'s lane towards <HI>Alders-gate,</HI>
and all about so furiously, as if it would
not leave a House standing upon the ground.</P>
<P>Now horrible flakes of fire mount up the
sky, and the yellow smoke of <HI>London</HI> ascendeth
up towards Heaven, like the smoak of a great
<HI>Furnace;</HI> a smoak so great, as darkned the Sun
at noon-day, (it at any time the Sun peeped
forth, it looked red like blood) the Cloud of
smoak was so great, that travellers did ride at
noon day some miles together in the shaddow
thereof, though there were no other cloud beside
to be seen in the sky.</P>
<P>And if <HI>Munday</HI> night was dreadfull, <HI>Tuesday</HI>
night was more dreadfull, when far the greatest
part of the City was consumed: many thou|sands
who on <HI>Saturday</HI> had Houses convenient in
the City, both for themselves, and to entertain
others, now have not where to lay their head;
and the fields are the only receptacle, which
they can find for themselves and their goods;
most of the late Inhabitants of <HI>London</HI> lye all
night in the open Ayr, with no other canopy over
them, but that of the Heavens: The fire is
still making towards them, and threatneth the
Suburbs; it was amazing to see, how it had
spread it self several miles in compass; and a|mongst
other things that night, the sight of <HI>Guild-hall</HI>
was a fearfull spectacle, which stood the
whole body of it together in view, for several
hours together, after the fire had taken it, without
flames, (I suppose because the timber was such
<PB N="67" REF="38">
solid Oake) in a bright shining coale as if it had
been a Pallace of gold, or a great building of bur|nished
Brass.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday</HI> morning, when people expected
that the Suburbs would be burnt, as well as the
City, and with speed, were preparing their flight,
as well as they could with their luggage into
the Countreys, and neighbouring Villages. Then
the Lord hath pitty on poor <HI>London;</HI> his bowels
begin to relent; his heart is turned within him,
and he <HI>stayes his rough wind in the day of the East
wind;</HI> his fury begins to be allayed; he hath a
<HI>remnant of people in London,</HI> and there shall
a <HI>remnant of houses</HI> escape; the wind now is
husht; the Commission of the fire is withdraw|ing,
and it burns so gently, even where it meets
with no opposition, that it was not hard to be
quenched, in many places, with a few hands:
now the Citizens begin to gather a little heart,
and encouragement in their endeavours to quench
the Fire. A check it had at <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> by that
great building; a stop it had in <HI>Bishopsgate-street,
Fen-church-street, Lime-street, Mark-lane,</HI> and to|wards
the <HI>Tower;</HI> one means, under God, was the
blowing up of houses with Gunpowder. Now it is
stayed in <HI>Lothbury, Broad-street, Coleman-street;</HI>
towards the gates it burnt, but not with any
great violence; at the <HI>Temple</HI> also it is stayed,
and in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> where it had got no great foot|ing;
and when once the fire was got under, it
was kept under, and on <HI>Thursday</HI> the flames were
extinguished.</P>
<P>But on <HI>Wednesday-night,</HI> when the people late
of <HI>London,</HI> now of the fields, hoped to get a
<PB N="68" REF="39">
little rest on the ground, where they had spread
their beds, a more dreadful fear fals upon them
than they had before, through a rumour that
the <HI>French</HI> were comming armed against them
to cut their throats, and spoil them of what they
had saved out of the Fire; they were now na|ked,
and weak, and in ill condition to defend
themselves, and the hearts, especially of the
females, do quake, and tremble, and are ready to
die within them; yet many Citizens having
lost their houses, and almost all that they had,
are fired with rage and fury: and they begin to
stir up themselves like Lyons, or like Bears be|reaved
of their whelps, and now <HI>Arm, Arm,
Arm,</HI> doth resound the Fields and Suburbs
with a dreadful voice. We may guess at the
distress and perplexity of the people this night,
which was something alleviated when the falsness
of the alarm was perceived.</P>
<P><HI>Thus fell great London,</HI> that ancient City! that
populous City! <HI>London,</HI> which was the Queen
City of the Land, and as famous as most Cities
in the world; none so famous for the Gospel
and zealous profession of the reformed Religion.
And yet how is <HI>London</HI> departed like smoak, and
her glory laid in the dust? how is her destruction
come, which no man thought of, and her deso|lation
in a moment? how do the Nations about
gaze and wonder? how doth the whole Land
tremble at the noise of her fall? how do her
Citizens droop and hang down their heads? her
Women and Virgins weep, and sit in the dust?
Oh, the paleness that now sits upon the cheeks!
the astonishment and confusion that covers the
<PB N="69" REF="39">
face, the dismall apprehensions that arise in the
minds of most, concerning the dreadful conse|quences
which are likely to be of this fall of
<HI>London?</HI> How is the pride of <HI>London</HI> stained, and
beauty spoiled! her arme broken, and strength
departed? her riches almost gone, and treasures
so much consumed? The head now is sick? and the
whole body faint; the heart is wounded, and
every other part is sensible of its stroke; never
was <HI>England</HI> in greater danger of being made a
prey to a forraign power, than since the firing
and fall of this City, which had the strength and
treasure of the Nation in it. How is <HI>London</HI> cea|sed,
that rich City! that joyous City! one
corner indeed is left, but more than as many
houses as were within the walls are turned into
ashes.</P>
<P>The Merchants now have left the <HI>Royal Ex|change;</HI>
the buyers and sellers have now forsaken
the streets: <HI>Grace-church-street, Cornhill, Cheap|side,
Newgate Market,</HI> and the like places, which
used some time to have throngs of traffiquers,
now are become empty of inhabitants; and in|stead
of the stately houses which stood there last
Summer, now they lie this Winter in ruinous
heaps. The glory of <HI>London</HI> is now fled away
like a Bird, the Trade of <HI>London</HI> is shattered
and broken to pieces, her delights also are va|nished,
and pleasant things laid waste; now no
chaunting to the sound of the Viol, and dan|cing
to the sweet Musick of other Instruments;
now no drinking Wine in Bowls, and stretching
upon the beds of lust; now no excess of Wine
and banquettings; no feasts in Halls and curious
<PB N="70" REF="40">
dishes; no amorous looks, &amp; wanton dalliances;
no ruffling silks, and costly dresses; these things
in that place are at an end. But if houses for
sin alone were sunke, and fuel for lust only were
consumed, it would not be so much; but the
houses also for Gods worship, (which formerly
were a bulwark against the fire, partly through
the walls about them, partly through the fervent
prayers within them) now are devoured by the
flames, and the habitations of many who truly
fear God, have not escaped; and in the places
where God hath been served, and his servants
have lived; now nettles are growing; owles are
screeching; thieves and cut-throats are lurking:
A sad face there is now in the ruinous part of
<HI>London:</HI> and terrible hath the voice of the Lord
been, which hath been crying, yea roaring in
the City by these dreadful judgments of the
Plague and Fire, which he hath brought upon
us.</P>
<P>Thus you have the Narration of the judgments
themselves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">2. Concerning the Cause of these Iudgments; why
hath the Lord spoken by such terrible things, in the
City of London?</HEAD>
<P>IN giving an account hereof, I shall make use
of the second Doctrine observed from the
words:</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="40">
That when God speaks most terribly, he doth answer
most righteously.</P>
<P>They are Gods judgments, and therefore they
must needs be righteous judgments; Can there be
unrighteousness in God? No, in no wise: for how
then could he be God? How then <HI>could he judge
the world? Let God be true, and every man a lyar.
Rom.</HI> 3. 5, 6. Let God be righteous, and all the
world unrighteous: for light may more easily de|part
from the Sun, and heat be separated from
the fire; and the whole creation may more easily
drop into nothing, than God cease to be just
and righteous, in the severest judgments which
he doth inflict upon the children of men.</P>
<P>If any profane mockers do reply against God,
and reflect upon his righteousness and goodness
towards his own people, because these judgments
have fallen so sore upon <HI>London,</HI> the Glory of
the Land, yea of the World, for the number of
godly persons (as in scoff they call them) which
dwell in it; if God were so righteous and
favourable to the Godly, would he bend his bow,
and shoot so many arrows amongst them as he
did in the visitation by the Plague, whilst he
suffered so many notoriously wicked persons to
escape? would he send the Fire to consume so
many habitations of the Godly, whilst the hou|ses
of the most vicious and vile were preserved?
I shall labour to stop the mouths of such, who are
ready to open them against the King of Heaven,
by proposing to consideration these following
particulars.</P>
<P>1. <HI>That Gods way is sometimes in the Sea, and
his paths in the great Waters; and his foot-steps are
<PB N="72" REF="41">
not known.</HI> Psal. 77. 19. <HI>That his judgments are un|searchable,
and his waies past finding out.</HI> Rom. 11.
33. And that even then <HI>he is righteous in all his
waies, and holy in all his works,</HI> Psal. 145. 17. And
<HI>when clouds and darkness are round about him, righ|teousness
and judgment are the habitation of his
Throne.</HI> Psal. 97. 2. And when <HI>his judgments are
a great deep, his righteousness is like the great Moun|tains.</HI>
Psal. 36. 6. We do not understand all the
mysteries of nature, neither are we acquainted
with all the mysteries of State; and if there be
some mysteries in Gods way of governing the
World, and distributing temporal mercies and
judgments, which we do not apprehend in every
thing the meaning of, and cannot so fully trace
Gods righteousness and goodness therein, let us
say it is because our eyes are shut, and that we
are covered with darkness: Therefore let us shut
our mouths too, and seal up our lips with si|lence,
not daring in the least to utter any thing
which may derogate from these attributes in
God, which are as inviolable and unchangeable
as his very Beeing. This might be said if the rea|son
were more abstruse than it is.</P>
<P>2. But secondly, the reason of Gods judgments
and righteousness therein, with the salve of his
goodness towards his own people, may be appre|hended,
if we consider.</P>
<P>1. That these Judgments of Plague and Fire
are both of them <HI>National</HI> judgments.</P>
<P>1. The judgment of the Plague was National;
in as much as <HI>London</HI> was the chief City, in as
much as the Kings Court was here, and most
Countries had relations here; and all Countries
<PB N="73" REF="41">
had concernments here: moreover the Plague
was not only in <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> and
and places neer adjacent, but it was dispersed
into the Countries at a farther distance, as <HI>Cam|bridge,
Norwich, Colchester,</HI> and other Towns,
where it raged either the same or the next year,
as much proportionably as it did in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>2. The Judgment of the Fire which burned
down only the City, and left <HI>Westminster</HI> and
the Suburbs standing, and did not reach into
the Countreys, yet was a National judgment,
because <HI>London</HI> was the Metropolis of the Land,
because the Beauty, Riches, Strength, and
Glory of the whole Kingdom lay in <HI>London:</HI>
and it was not the inhabitants of the City who
alone did suffer by this fire, but the whole
Land more or less, do and will feel the smart
hereof.</P>
<P>2. These Judgments then being National: it is
not unreasonable to say, that National sins have
been the cause of them: and if so, we may readily
finde a reason of Gods righteousness in these
proceedings; when the sins of the Land are so
obvious and so hainous. He is a great stranger
in <HI>England,</HI> that doth not know how wickedness
hath abounded in these later years; his eyes must
be fast shut, who doth not see what a deluge of
profaneness and impiety hath broken in like a
mighty torrent, and overflowed the Land; that
hath not taken notice of those bare-fac'd villa|nies
which have been committed amongst us,
which is a great question whether any ages be|fore
us could parallel; we read in Scripture of
<HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and the wickedness some|time
<PB N="74" REF="42">
of <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> Profane Histories and Tra|vellers
make mention of <HI>Rome, Venice, Naples,
Paris,</HI> and other places very wicked, but who
can equal <HI>England,</HI> which calls it self Christian
and Protestant, for such desperate and audaci|ous
affronts and indignities which have been
offered to the Highest Majesty, by the Gallants
(as they are called) of our times: How was Hell
as it were broke loose, and how were men worse
than those which in our Saviours time were possest
with devils, who cut themselves with stones, and
tore their own flesh; even such who went about
like so many Hell-hounds and incarnate devils,
cursing and banning, swearing and blaspheming,
inventing new oaths, and glorying therein, de|lighting
to tear the name of God, and to spit
forth their rancour and malice in his very face?
and can we then be at a loss for a reason of Gods
righteousness in his thus punishing <HI>England,</HI> by
beginning thus furiously with <HI>London?</HI> When
there were so many Atheists about <HI>London,</HI> and
in the Land, who denied the very being of God,
when so many Gentlemen (who lookt upon it as
one piece of their breeding, to cast off all senti|ments
of a Deity) did walk our streets, and no
arguments would work them to a perswasion of
the truth of Gods being, shall we wonder if the
Lord appears in a terrible way, that he might be
known by the judgments which he executeth?
When so many denied the Divine Authority of
the Scriptures, the very foundation of our Chri|stian
faith, and reckoned themselves by their
principles amongst Turks, Pagans, and other
Infidels, however they called themselves Chri|stians,
<PB N="75" REF="42">
and hereby put such an affront upon the
Lord Jesus Christ, the only Son of the most high
God, is it strange that the Lord should speak so
terribly to shew his indignation? when there
was such blowing at, and endeavours to put out
that light, which would shew Men the way to
Heaven; such hatred and opposition against the
power of godliness; when the name of a Saint
was matter of derision and scorn; when there
was such wallowing in filthy fornication, and a|dultry,
in swinish drunkenness and intemperance;
when such oppression, bribery, such malice, cru|elty,
such unheard of wickedness and hideous im|piety
grown to such a heighth in the Land; may
not we reasonably think that such persons as were
thus guilty, being in the Ship, were a great cause
of the storme of Gods anger, which hath made
such a shipwrack.</P>
<P>The Plague indeed when it was come, made
little discrimination between the bodies of the
righteous, and the bodies of the wicked; no
more doth grace; the difference is more in|ward
and deepe; it is the soul begins to be
glorifyed hereby, and hath the seed of eternal
life put into it, when it doth pass the new birth;
but the body is not changed with the soul, the
body remains as it was, as frail and weak, and
exposed to diseases and death, as before, and
as the body of any wicked person; and there|fore
the infectious disease of the Plague, com|ing
into a populous City, the bodies of the righ|teous;
amongst the rest, receive the contagion,
and they fall in the common calamity; there is
a difference in the manner of their death, and
<PB N="76" REF="43">
a difference in their place, and state after death,
as hath been spoken of before, but the kind of
death is the same.</P>
<P>So the fire doth make no discrimination be|tween
the Houses of the godly, and the Houses
of the ungodly, they are all made of the same
combustible matter, and are enkindled, as bo|dies
infected, one by another; indeed the god|ly
have God to be their habitation, and they are
Citizens of the new <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which is above,
a City which hath foundations, whose builder
and maker is God; an abiding City, which the
fire cannot reach, and their persons are secured
from the flames of eternal fire in Hell, but they
have no promise nor security for the preservation
of their Houses from fire here in this World.
The judgments of the plague and fire being
sent, work according to their nature, without
distinguishing the righteous.</P>
<P>But if we further enquire into the reason,
why the plague was sent the last year, and such a
plague as hath not been known this forty year,
which raged so sorely, when there was no such
sultriness of weather (as in other years) to en|crease
it; and why the fire was sent this year, and
such a fire as neither we, nor our fore-fathers
ever knew, neither do we read of in any History
of any so great in any place, in time of peace;
what shall we say was the cause of these extraor|dinary
national judgments, but the extraordi|nary
national sins. It was an extraordinary hand
of God which brought the plague, of which no
natural cause can be assigned, why it should be so
great that year, more then in former years, but
<PB N="77" REF="43">
that sin was grown to greater heighth; and that
a fire should prevaile, against all attempts to
quench it, to burn down the City, and that
judgment just following upon the heels of the o|ther;
what reason can be assigned, but that <HI>Eng|lands</HI>
sins, and Gods displeasure hath been ex|traordinary;
God is a God of patience, and it
is not a light thing will move him; he is slow to
anger, it must needs be then some great provo|cation
which makes him so furious; he is highly
offended, before he lifts up his hand; and he is
exceedingly incens'd, before his anger breaks
forth into such a flame; for my part, I verily
think, if it had not been for the crying abomina|tions
of the times, which are not chiefly to be
limited to the City of <HI>London,</HI> and if the means
of Gods prescription, according to the <HI>Rule</HI> of
his <HI>Word,</HI> which <HI>England</HI> sometime could, had
by <HI>England</HI> been made use of, that both Plague
and Fire had been prevented.</P>
<P>3. Moreover it may be said that some parti|cular
persons by some more peculiar, and notori|ous
sins in the City may have provoked the Lord
to bring punishment upon the whole place, if
the Land were not so generally profane and wick|ed,
the heathen could say.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>A whole City may be punished for the wicked|ness
of one Man; yea we read of <HI>David,</HI> though
so good a man, yet when he numbred the people
(a small sin in comparison with the sins of some
others in our days) God was provoked to send
such a dreadful Plague, not on himself, but upon
his people, that there dyed 70000 men by it in
<PB N="78" REF="44">
three days, and <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>I have sinned and done
wickedly, but these sheep, what have they done? 2 Sam.</HI>
24. 10-18.</P>
<P>4. If it be enquired how Gods mercy to his
people doth appear, when these judgments have
fallen so heavy upon many of them?</P>
<P>I Answer,</P>
<P>1. Those of his own people, who have fallen
by the Plague, are received to greater grace and
mercy in Heaven, than here they were capable
of, and they are moreover delivered from evil to
come, which hath since, and may further come
upon us.</P>
<P>2. Those whose houses have fallen by the fire,
the Lord could, and confident I am, the Lord
hath made them greater gainers another way,
they have lost it may be much in temporal things,
but they are or may be, if they be not wanting
to themselves, gainers in spiritual things, which
are of a higher and more excellent nature; I have
known and heard of many of Gods people whose
houses are burnt, and goods spoyled, who have
taken the loss with so much chearfulness, humili|ty,
meekness, patience, contentment, and thank|fulness
that any thing was saved, if it were only
their lives, that it hath been my wonder and joy;
to gain such a spirit hath more of good, than
the loss of all externall enjoyments hath of evil.</P>
<P>3. Further, if these judgments have fallen
upon Gods people, we must know that they have
their sins, which have deserved them, possibly
some have begun now to comply with the wick|ed
in their wicked wayes, it may be they were
grown more loose in their walking, and formal in
<PB N="79" REF="44">
the service of God, &amp; their hearts more set on the
World, of which sins more largely when I come
to speak of the sins of the City; and the sins
of Gods people have more hainous aggravations,
than the sins of the wicked, being committed a|gainst
clearer light, dearer love, sweeter mer|cies,
stronger obligations, and therefore provoke
God the more to wrath; therefore he threatneth
his own people especially to punish them when
they transgress, <HI>Am. 3. 2. You only have I known
of all the Families of the Earth, and therefore I
will punish you for your iniquities.</HI></P>
<P>5. Besides, they may have need of awakening
judgments to rouze them, and humble them for
sin, to loosen and wean them from the World;
and it is in love and faithfulness, that God doth
inflict such judgments upon them.</P>
<P>6. Lastly, we must remember, that it is Gods
usual course to begin with his own house, 1 <HI>Pet.
4. 17. Iudgement begins at the House of God.</HI></P>
<P>5. To conclude, Do any of the ungodly que|stion
Gods righteousness, because in these com|mon
calamities, they have hitherto survived
and escaped?</P>
<P>1. It is but an ill requital and ill use, which
they make of Gods patience and goodness which
he hath exercised towards them, that hereby he
might lead them unto repentance, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 4, 5.</P>
<P>2. Let them stay a while, and God will an|swer
them himself, and give them an experimen|tal
conviction of his righteous judgments, 1 <HI>Pet.
4. 17, 18. If judgment begin at the house of God,
what shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel?
and if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall
<PB N="80" REF="45">
the ungodly and sinners appear?</HI> we read <HI>Psal. 75. 8.
Of a Cup of red Wine in the hand of the Lord,</HI> he
may give his people to drink the top of it, but
the most bitter and dreggish part, which is at the
bottome, the <HI>wicked shall wring forth and drink;</HI>
if God whip his children with rods, he will scourge
his enemies with scorpions.</P>
<P>I am perswaded that the notoriously ungodly
of this generation will not go out of this World,
without some remarkable temporal judgment;
and that the Lord will make them feel something
even here, what an evil thing, and a bitter it is
so audaciously to fly in the face of the great God,
by their hideous oaths and blasphemies, by their
horrid wickedness and abominations, whereby
they do as it were challenge God to do his worst
against them; and when God doth draw forth his
glittering Sword, and make ready his sharp arrow
upon the string; when God doth cloathe himself
with fury, as with a garment, and his hand doth
take hold on vengeance; when their iniquities
are grown fully ripe, and the day of their visita|tion
and recompence is come, how then will
these sinners of <HI>England</HI> be afraid, and what a|mazing
terrour will there then surprize this vile
generation? <HI>Can their hearts endure, or their hands
be strong in the day that the Lord shall deal with
them? Ezek.</HI> 22. 14. Then the Lord will roar
from his holy habitation, with such a terrible
voice, as shall make their ears to tingle, their
hearts to quake and tremble; he will roar like a
Lion, and tear them in pieces, when there shall
be none to deliver. If the shaking of his rod
hath moved them, and the beginning of his judg|ments,
<PB N="81" REF="45">
which he hath executed upon others, hath
affrighted them; what will their behaviour be
when the scourge is laid upon their own backs,
and judgment shall fall upon their own heads?
Surely the judgments intended purposely for the
most ungodly, are not yet come; yet, as they are
like to be exceeding great, because more of pure,
and unmixt wrath will accompany them: so they
are like to be very neer; because they are filling
up the measure of their wickedness so fast, and
they seem to be arrived even to the uttermost of
sin; surely their judgment doth neither linger,
nor slumber, but is upon the wing, hastning to|wards
them; surely the arme of the Lord is a|wakened,
and lifted up on high, and though in|finite
patience doth hold it up a little while, to
try whether the judgments already executed up|on
others, before their eyes will work any good
effect upon them, so as to awaken them, and stop
them, and turn them from their evil wayes; yet,
if they proceed in their sinfull course, his arm I
am perswaded will come down with such force
and fury upon them, that their destruction shall
be remarkable to all that are round about them:
and I have much of that perswasion, that the Lord
will as it were hang up many of the villains of
our times, who have been guilty of such trea|chery
and rebellion against the great King of
heaven, as it were in chains, and make their
punishment here as notorious as their sins have
been, that the whole World may hear and fear,
and take heed of such vile practises: I suppose
they may not now expect it, nor fear it, no more
than the old World did their drowning, or <HI>Sodom</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="46">
and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> did their burning, because deceit|ful
sin hath hardned their hearts; long custome in
sin, with impunity hath seared their consciences,
as with a hot Iron: but then they are in the
greatest danger, when they sleep with the great|est
security; when Men grow desperately hard|ned
against often, and all reproofs, by word, and
rod too, what followes, but <HI>sudden destruction
and that without remedy? Prov. 29. 1. and when
men cry peace and safety, then sudden destruction
cometh upon them, as travel upon a Woman with childe,
and they shall not escape, 1 Thess.</HI> 5. 3. And if
some of this untoward and wicked Generation
do drop away without a remarkable temporal de|struction;
God will make his righteousness evi|dent
to them, in the other World, when he claps
up their souls close Prisoners in the lowest dungeon
of Hell, appointing black Devils to be their
Jaylors, flames of fire to be their cloathing, hi|deous
terrours and woe to be their food, <HI>Cain, Iu|das,</HI>
and other damned tormented spirits to be
their companions, where they must lye bound in
chains of darkness, till the judgment of the great
day; and when the general assize is come, and the
Angels have blown the last Trumpet, and gather|ed
the elect to the right hand of Christ, then they
will be sent with the Keys of the bottomless Pit,
and the Prison will be opened for a while, and
like so many Rogues in Chains, they shall toge|ther
with all their fellow sinners be brought forth,
and finde out the dirty flesh of their bodies, which
like a nasty ragg they shall then put on, and with
most rufull looks, and trembling joynts, and hor|rible
shreeks, and unexpressible confusion and
<PB N="83" REF="46">
terrour, they shall behold the Lord Jesus Christ,
whom in life time they despised and affronted,
come down from Heaven in flaming fire, to take
vengeance upon them, who will sentence them
to the flames of eternal fire, and drive them
from his Throne and presence into utter dark|ness,
where they must take up their lodging for
evermore. <HI>Then, Then</HI> there will be a clear re|velation
of the righteous and dreadful judgments
of this great God unto the world, and upon this
accursed generation.</P>
<P>But more fully to clear up the reason of <HI>Lon|don's</HI>
judgments, and the righteousness of God
herein; God hath indeed spoken very terribly,
but he hath answered us very righteously. <HI>Lon|don</HI>
was not so godly, as some speak by way of
scoff: no! If <HI>London</HI> had been more generally
godly, and more powerfully godly, these judg|ments
might have been escaped, and the ruins
of the City prevented; No! it was the ungodli|ness
of <HI>London,</HI> which brought the Plague and fire
upon <HI>London.</HI> There was a general Plague upon the
heart, a more dangerous infection, and dead|ly
Plague of sin, before there was sent a Plague
upon the body; there was a fire of divers lusts
which was enkindled, and did burn in the bo|some,
som t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">mes issuing out flames at the door
of the mouth, and at the windows of the eyes
of the inhabitants, before the fire was kindled
in the City, which swallowed up so many habita|tions.
We have fallen, thousands of persons into
the grave by the Plague, thousands of houses,
as a great monument upon them, by the fire;
and whence is it? <HI>we are fallen by our iniquities.
<PB N="84" REF="47">
Hosea 14. 1. the Crown is fallen from our heads;</HI>
and what is the reason? <HI>because we have sinned
against the Lord. Lam.</HI> 5. 16. God hath spoken
terribly, but he hath answered righteously; as he
gives great and especial mercies in answer unto
prayer: so he sendeth great and extraordinary
judgments in answer unto sin; there is a voice
and loud cry, especially in some sins which <HI>entreth
into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath. 1 Sam.</HI> 5. 4.
When God speaks by terrible things, he makes
but a righteous return to this cry.</P>
<P>And though these Judgments of Plague and
Fire are National judgments, and may be the
product of National sins, and I verily am per|swaded,
that God was more highly provoked by
some that dwelt out of the City, than with those
which dwelt in it, I mean the profane and un|godly
generation, who chiefly did inhabit more
remotely; and that God, being so provokt, was
the more ready to strike, and let his hand fall
so heavy upon <HI>London;</HI> yet since many of the
ungodly crew were got into the City it self, and
most in the City, that were not of them, &amp; did not
dare to commit their impieties, yet made them|selves
guilty, by not mourning for them, and
labouring in their place what they could after a
redress; and since <HI>London</HI> it self hath been guil|ty
of so many crying sins (as I shall endeavour to
shew.) Gods righteousness in the terrible things
of <HI>London</HI> will be evident, especially if we con|sider</P>
<P>1. That God hath punished <HI>London</HI> no more than
their iniquities have deserved.</P>
<P>2. That God hath punished <HI>London</HI> less than their
iniquities have deserved.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="47">
1. <HI>God hath punished</HI> London <HI>no more than their
iniquities deserved;</HI> Great sins deserve great
Plagues; and have not the sins of <HI>London</HI> been
great? Let us make an inquity after <HI>Londons</HI>
sins.</P>
<P>Here I shall offer some sins to consideration,
and let <HI>London</HI> judge whether she be not guilty,
and whether the Lord hath not been plaguing
her, and burning her, and possibly, yea probably
will bring utter ruin and desolation upon her,
except she see and mourn and turn the sooner:
It is out of dear and tender love to <HI>London</HI> (with
whom I could willingly live and die) that I
write these things to put them in mind of their
sins, that they might take some speedy course
for a redress and turning away the fierce anger
of the Lord which is kindled against them for
sin, lest he next proceed to bring utter ruin upon
them: surely they have not more reason to think
that Gods anger is turned away since the fire,
than they had to think it was turned away after
the Plague; but rather they may conclude, that
though the fire of the City bee quenched yet
the fire of Gods anger doth burn still more dread|fully,
than the other fire; and that his hand is
stretched out still to destroy. Therefore, O all
yee inhabitants about <HI>Lond<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> open your eyes, and
ears, and hearts, and suffer a word of reproof
for your sins; and deal not with this Catalogue
of your sins as <HI>Iehojakim</HI> did with <HI>Ieremiah's</HI> roll,
who burnt it in the fire, not being able to bear
his words; but do with it as <HI>Iohn</HI> did with his
little book, eat it and digest it, though it be
<PB N="86" REF="48">
bitter in the mouth, as well as in the belly; it is
bitter Physick, but necessary for the preservation
of a sick languishing City, which is even ready
to give up the Ghost.</P>
<P>And here I shall begin with more Gospel-sins,
which, though natural conscience is not so ready
to accuse of, yet in the account of God are the
most heinous sins: And I would have a re|gard
not only to latter, but also to former sins,
which, possibly, may now be more out of view, and
forgotten, and which some may be hardned in,
because the guilty have not been so particularly
and sensibly punished (though Gods sparing of
them hath been in order to their repentance) or
their punishments in some kinde hath been ac|counted
by them no punishments, or their pu|nishments
have been mistaken, and their hearts
have swelled against instruments made use of by
God therein, instead of accepting of the pu|nishment
of their iniquity, and humbling them|selves
deeply before the Lord. I say I would
call to remembrance former sins, as well as lat|ter,
which are more visible now and apparent:
for as God, being so slow to anger, hath not been
quickly moved to such indignation; but, as we
have reason to think, that his wrath hath been a
long time boiling in his breast, before it was rai|sed
to this heighth as to boile over, and pour
down Plague and Fire upon the City of <HI>London:</HI>
so we may reasonably infer, that sins committed
by <HI>London</HI> long agoe, were the fuel put under,
that caused this boiling of his anger, which,
because other judgments have not wrought the
kindly effect of repentance, the Lord hath been
<PB N="87" REF="48">
provoked to express this way, which hath been
more feeling and dreadfull. Moreover when I
reckon up <HI>London</HI>'s sins, I would not reflect a|lone
upon any one party, in as much as all par|ties
have sinned, and I believe the Lord hath been
offended with all, as in his judgments he hath
made no difference, that all might be awakened
to see their faults with sorrow and shame. And if
it were fit, I would begin here with my self, be|ing
perswaded that my sins, more then thousands
of others, have helpt to fill up the Viol of Gods
anger; but as I go along, I shall endeavour by
the grace of God to apply to my self the sins
which conscience will accuse of, that I may be|wail
and amend: and I would beseech every
one of you, that cast your eyes upon these lines,
to do the like, and to compare them with those
lines, which are written in the Book of your con|sciences,
and where you finde a transcript, read
and read again, consider and lay to heart, get to
your knees, confess and labour to drop, at least
some teares into the Bottle, which if this little
Book might help gather from your eyes, and you
could be perswaded to pour forth such waters be|fore
the Lord, they might help to quench the vi|olence
of the Fire of Gods anger, which we
have reason to fear is still burning against us.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Catalogue of London's sins, which have provo|ked
the Lord to speak with so terrible a voice in
the City.</HEAD>
<P>1. <HI>THe first sin of</HI> London <HI>is slighting of the
Gospel.</HI> The Gospel in <HI>England</HI> hath a|bove
this hundred years shined forth out of the
clouds of Popery and Antichristianisme, which
before did over-spread the Land; and in no place
of <HI>England</HI> hath the Gospel been preached with
greater power and purity than in <HI>London;</HI> and
what entertainment hath it found? hath it been
valued according to its worth and excellency?
hath it been received as if it had come down
from the God of Heaven, expressing his love and
good-will towards the children of Men, as if it
had brought such good newes and tidings, as sal|vation
by Jesus Christ?</P>
<P>Read the elogium which the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI>
gives of the salvation made known by the Gospel,
1 <HI>Pet. 1. 10, 11, 12. Of which salvation the Pro|phets
have enquired, and searched diligently, who
prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:
searching what, or what manner of time the spirit of
Christ which was in them, did signify when it testified
before-hand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that
should follow: unto whom it was revealed, that not
unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the
things, which are now reported unto you, by them that
have preached the Gospel unto you, with the holy Ghost
sent down from Heaven, which things the Angels de|sire
<PB N="89" REF="49">
to look into.</HI> The Prophets of old did enquire
and search, but did not so clearly understand the
Gospel, as now it is revealed, our Saviour tells
his Disciples, <HI>Luke</HI> 10. 24. That <HI>many Prophets
and Kings had desired to see the things which they saw
and had not seen them, and to hear the things, which
they did hear, and had not heard them;</HI> for indeed
<HI>this mystery was hid from ages and generations which
God then made manifest unto the Saints, Col.</HI> 1. 26.
And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that though the mi|nistration
of the Law were glorious, in so much
that it made the face of <HI>Moses</HI> to shine, unto
whom the Law was revealed upon the Mount,
yet that it had no glory, in comparison with the
ministration of the Gospel, whose glory did so
far excell, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 7, 10. the mysteries of Gods
wisdome and love revealed in the Gospel, being
so glorious, surely are worthy of acceptation and
esteem, especially when the Angels who are not
so much concerned, desire to look into these
things, unto whom it is said, <HI>Eph. 3. 10. Is made
known by the Church the manifold wisedome of God.</HI>
And yet these great things, which have been re|ported
by them, who have preached the Gospel,
with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven,
have been undervalued in <HI>London.</HI> The Gospel
hath been slighted in <HI>London,</HI> and though some
have been more notoriously guilty, yet who can
altogether excuse themselves from this sin? Now
that the conviction may be more full, I shall
charge the sin more particularly.</P>
<P>1. The <HI>ignorant</HI> persons in <HI>London</HI> have been
guilty of this sin, the light of the Gospel hath
shin'd about them, but they have mufled up them|selves
<PB N="90" REF="50">
in darkness, and suffered Sathan to keep
them hood-wink'd, least the light of the glorious
Gospel should enter, and lead them out of his
snare; thousands in the City have been <HI>affectedly</HI>
ignorant: though they have had means of know|ledge,
so near, and so easy to come by, multi|tudes
have perished out of <HI>London,</HI> and multi|tudes
still remain in their ignorance. O the neg|lect
that there hath been of learning Catechisms!
and how few have endeavour'd to acquaint them|selves
with the Principles of the Christian Reli|gion,
that they might have the more full and clear
understanding of the Gospel?</P>
<P>2. The <HI>vicious</HI> and <HI>profane</HI> have been guilty of
slighting the Gospel, how many such persons
have there crouded, and are still crouding out of
<HI>London</HI> into Hell, when the light of the Gospel
shined upon them, which would have guided them
in the way to Heaven: because this light hath
been too troublesome in its discovery, and re|proof
of their dear and sweet sins; they have ha|ted
it, and endeavoured to fly as far as they
could from it, or to shut their eyes as hard as
they could against it.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>civil</HI> persons also have been guilty,
there have been many sober Citizens, and Ma|trons,
civil youths, and virgins, who have been
free from the gross pollutions, which are in the
World through lust, who have been diligent in
their calling, just in their dealings, courteous,
and sweet natur'd in their demeanour, and yet
without the least degree of the power of godli|ness,
without which it is impossible they should
be saved, alas! none of these have given any
<PB N="91" REF="50">
warme welcome unto the Gospel in their hearts,
which hath been so long preached in the City; the
kindness of a friend hath been esteemed by them,
but the kindness of God hath not been regarded:
if a Messenger had come and told them how
they might save their estates, when in danger of
loss, or how to save their relations when in dan|ger
of death; O how welcome would such a mes|senger
and tidings have been? but when Ministers
have preached the Gospel unto them, which tells
them how they should save their souls, in danger
of death and hell, such tidings have had no relish
with them, as if they had no souls, or were in
no danger: the light hath shined before them,
but there hath been a cloud in their eye, they
could not discern it; or they have look'd upon it
afar off, they have not drawn neer, and brought
it home, and set it up in their bosomes, that
they might order themselves, and whole conver|sations,
according to its guidance and direction.</P>
<P>4. The <HI>Hypocrites</HI> have been guilty of this sin,
these have drawn neerer to this light, than any
of the former; so neer, that they have seem'd to
be cloathed with its beames, they have lighted
their Lamps hereby, and have shined forth in a
glorious blaze of an outward profession, yet there
hath been even in these an inward secret disrelish
of the Gospel, especially of some things in it;
there have been some secret rooms in their hearts
into which they would not suffer the light to en|ter,
least it should discover those beloved <HI>Dalilah's</HI>
which there they have nourished and brought up,
they have been rotten at the Core, and have had
some unmortified lust within, which the World
<PB N="92" REF="51">
hath not taken notice of; so that if the Gospel
hath been received by them, it hath been only
in the outward form, not in the inward power;
if the light hath been received, it hath been with|out
its heat and life. Hence it hath come to
pass that some of these Hypocrites, who seemed
to be Stars of the first magnitude, have proved
only Blazing-stars and Commets, which in a short
time have fallen and sunk into wilde opinions, or
fearful Apostacy.</P>
<P>5. The <HI>Errone us</HI> have been guilty of this
sin; some and not a few in <HI>London,</HI> under this
glorious Sun-shine of the Gospel, which hath
come from Heaven, have lighted a Candle at the
Fire of Hell, and laboured to set it up in oppo|sition
to the true Light of the Gospel, crying
out, New Light, new Light. Sathan himself
hath appeared in <HI>London</HI> like an Angel of Light,
and employed his Emissaries and wicked instru|ments
(who have seemed to be Ministers of
righteousness, but have had a wolfish ravenous
heart under the dress and cloathing of the sheep)
to vent many damnable and destructive opi|nions
in our Church, under pretence of new
discoveries and revelations of the spirit; and
though this false and Taper-light could never
abide the test, and put forth any beams of con|vincing
truth, but darkned and disappeared up|on
the approach of the Sun, where it shined in
its power; yet too many whose eyes were too fore
to look upon the glorious beams of the Sun, and
yet withall their hearts too fearful to remain
wholly in the dark without any shew of light,
did withdraw themselves from the former, and
<PB N="93" REF="51">
sought after the later in dark corners, where alone
such rotten wood could seem to shine, and such
candles could give forth any light, and choosing
night rather than day&punc; they followed these false
wandring fires, though they were led by them
into many a precipice.</P>
<P>It is sad to remember, and seriously to consider
what errours and strong delusions have aboun|ded
and prevailed in our Gospel-daies. How
many false teachers have there been among us,
which have crept in at unawares? how many Je|suits
and Priests sent from <HI>Rome</HI> and other places,
to rend and tear our Protestant Church to pieces,
that they might make way for the introduction
of Popery, at least to cast a disgrace upon Pro|testantism,
and delude many <HI>of us</HI> with the opi|nions
they have broached, and to confirm <HI>their own</HI>
in their delusions; thus many cunning &amp; learned
Jesuits have disguised themselves in the habit
of Taylors, Shoo-makers, and of other mechanical
Tradesmen, that they might seem to the people
to have been taught those things by the Spirit,
which have been the product of much study;
thus these cursed villains, of old ordained to con|demnation,
have privily brought in damnable
heresies, some calling themselves Quakers, o|thers
Ranters, other Seekers, others Antino|mians,
others Brownists, others Anabaptists;
putting themselves into any shapes, that they
might mis-lead, and the better lye in wait to
deceive poor souls; some denying the Lord that
bought them, setting up the fancy of a Christ
within them for their Saviour; others denying
the foundation, undermining the Divine Au|thority
<PB N="94" REF="52">
of the Scriptures; others labouring to
overthrow the Doctrine of Justification, and
striking at most fundamental Doctrines in the
Christian faith; and all of them endeavouring
to undermine the ministry of Christs institution,
and sending, calling them Anti-Christian, <HI>Baals</HI>
Priests, False Prophets, doing what they could to
bring them and their ministry out of esteem, that
they might the more effectually prevaile with
the people to receive their false doctrines, and
arm them hereby against an undeceivement; and
sweetning their poison with good words and fair
speeches, they have deceived the hearts of the
simple, so that many did follow their pernicious
waies, by reason of whom the way of truth hath
been evil spoken of, and what ever good words
they had, they were but feigned words, whereby
they made merchandize of souls, <HI>Whose judgment
now a long time lingreth not, and whose damnation
slumbreth not. 2 Pet.</HI> 2. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>These the Apostle calls spots and blemishes,
sporting themselves with their own deceivings,
Wells without Water, Clouds carried about with
a Tempest, Raging waves of the Sea, foaming out
their own shame, Wandring stars, unto whom is
reserved blackness of darkness for ever. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.
13, 17. <HI>Iud.</HI> 13.</P>
<P>And yet many of these were hearkned unto,
and adheared unto by too many in <HI>London,</HI> rather
than the true Gospel Ministers, commissioned
by the Lord Jesus Christ himself, and ordai|ned
according to the Prescription of his Word.</P>
<P>Then many Lay-men, some gifted, (who would
have given a better account of their gifts at the
<PB N="95" REF="52">
great day had they kept their station) and some
without gifts, but with a great measure of igno|rance
and confidence, did step up sometimes into
Pulpits, often took upon them to preach in private,
invading the office, and intruding into the work
of Christs Embassadours, which he hath appoin|ted
a peculiar office for, and which he hath set a
hedge about more than any other office we read
of in Scripture; but they ventured to break
over the hedge, I am confident to the affronting
and displeasing of the <HI>great King,</HI> whose repre|sentatives
in the world his Embassadours are; and
not only silly women were led captive by the de|ceivers
which crept in when so many took li|berty
to preach, but also men who professed
themselves to be wise, and to have attained to a
degree of light above the vulgar; yet forsaking
the Ministery and Ordinances of Jesus Christ,
appointed to continue unto the end of the world,
for the instructing, perfecting, and establishment
of Saints in knowledge and faith, they became
fools and <HI>children, tossed to and fro with every mind
of doctrine, by the slight of them</HI> which led them aside.
<HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>Now all these persons have been slighters of
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Ignorant, the
Profane, the Hypocrite, and the Erroneous; and
if you place them all in one company, how few
will there remain in <HI>London,</HI> that have sincerely
and heartily imbraced the truth as it is in Jesus,
and upon whom the Gospel hath made a power|ful
and saving impression? And even amongst
those that have been affected and converted by
the preaching of the Gospel, and had it greatly
<PB N="96" REF="53">
in esteem at first hearing and believing; how
was their esteem of the Gospel fallen, and their
affection cooled? did not Gospel-ordinan|ces
begin to loose their worth and excellen|cy,
and grow tedious and wearisome unto
them? O how generally unthankful was <HI>Lon|don</HI>
for the Gospel priviledges and liberties!
yea, many began to be very nice and wanton,
&amp; the Gospel was not relished, unless it were ser|ved
up with such neatnesses &amp; dressings, in which
some Ministers possibly did too much endeavour
to please themselves and the people, and then
the sauce was more relished than the food it
selfe; and the appetite of many was so spoiled,
that plain wholsome soul-saving truths would
not down with them. <HI>Londoners</HI> began to be
glutted with the Gospel, and like the <HI>Israelites</HI>
in the Wilderness, their souls began to loathe the
Mannah which came down from Heaven; a
strange curiosity there was in spiritual pallates,
which in many turned to a loathing of the food,
in so much that the Gospel became a burden unto
them, and thence it was that many turned away
their ears from the truth, and were turned unto
errours, and they could not indure to hear
sound doctrine, but having itching ears, heaped up
unto themselves teachers according to their lusts.
2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 3, 4.</P>
<P>And those that continued stedfast in the truth,
did not duly prize the Gospel, none of them
according to its dignity and worth. No wonder
then if God grows angry at such contempts and
affronts as were hereby offered unto him, and
easeth them so much of their burden, and with|draws
<PB N="97" REF="53">
the food so much, which they grew so weary
of: No wonder that he suffers so many of their
teachers to be thrust into corners, and so much
withdraws the beams of that light which was so
much abused, and when they are not sensible of
his displeasure in this, no wonder if he sends the
Plague and Fire, to awaken them unto a sensi|bility.</P>
<P>When the King sent forth his servants to call
the guests to the Wedding-feast, and they make
light of it and excuse themselves, and go away,
one to his Farm, another to his Merchandize,
and the remnant took his servants and entrea|ted
them spightfully and slew them: The King
was wroth, and sent forth his Armies to destroy
those murderers, and burn their City. <HI>Matth.</HI> 22.
from <HI>v.</HI> 1. to <HI>v.</HI> 8. God hath sent forth his fer|vants
to call Londoners to this <HI>Feast;</HI> how many
invitations have they had to come unto Christ, to
accept of him, to save them, and feed upon him,
from whom alone they can get any Spiritual
nourishment; but how many in <HI>London</HI> have had
their excuses, they have been following their
Merchandize and other business, and could not
come; and what entertainment his servants hath
had; the Lord knows: I do not say that <HI>London</HI> hath
entertained them despightfully, and slain them;
but have not their message been slighted by <HI>Lon|don?</HI>
and is it a wonder then if the King that
sent them be wroth, and send a Fire to burn
down the City? No greater favour could be
shewed, no greater priviledge could be enjoyed,
than to have the Gospel powerfully preached,
and ordinances purely administred; but hath
<PB N="102" REF="54">
it been generally so accounted in <HI>London?</HI> hath
not Merchandize, and thriving in the world
(which yet they have not thrived in) been pre|ferred
before this by many thousands in the City?
when God hath been at such an expence to work
out a way for mans salvation; when he hath
discovered such wonders of astonishing Love in
sending his only begotten Son out of Heaven to
cloath himself in our flesh, that therein he might
purchase life and salvation for us who were sunk
so low from our Primitive state by sin, and were
exposed to death and wrath, &amp; unavoidable end|less
misery in Hell; and hath sent his Embassa|dours
of peace to bring unto us the glad tidings
hereof, and in his name to make known the
thing, the Authour, the tearms, the way; and to
intreat us that we would accept of life and recon|ciliation
to God, who without any injury to
himself could ruin us everlastingly, and get
himself a name thereby; and yet when the Gospel
is preached that we should undervalue and slight
both messenger &amp; message; surely this hath been
an affront to the Lord, who hath sent his Embas|sadours
on this errand, and doth carry with it such
ingratitude as cannot be paralleld.</P>
<P>No doubt but this sin of slighting the Gospel is
a prime sin, which hath provoked God against
<HI>London,</HI> to come forth in such fury; and if <HI>Lon|don</HI>
do not repent the sooner, and labour to re|cover
its relish and esteem for the Gospel, and
make more evident demonstrations of it, I fear
the Lord will quite remove the Gospel from
them, and then nothing is like to follow but
desolation and wo; God doth not remove his
<PB N="103" REF="54">
glory at once but by steps; first the glory of the
Lord departs from the Inner-court, to the Thre|shold
of the house, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 10. 3, 4. from the
Threshold of the house to the Door of the East|gate.
<HI>v.</HI> 18, 19. then it goes from the midst of
the City, and standeth upon the Mountain,
<HI>Chap.</HI> 11. 23. The Gospel is the glory of <HI>London,</HI>
and hath the glory of the Lord made none of
these removes? is it not come forth of the Inner|court?
hath it not left the Threshold? is not a
departing of it quite from the City threatned?
will any thing recover it, if we do not recover
our appetite, and prize, and cry after it.</P>
<P>If the Gospel go, God will go, the Gospel
being the sign and means of his special presence,
and <HI>wo be unto us when God shall depart from us.
Hos.</HI> 9. 12. And if God depart with the Gospel,
farewel peace and prosperity in <HI>England,</HI> nothing
I dare be confident but temporal misery and
ruine will be the consequent; if the Ecclipse bring
such misery, what will the quite darkning of the
Sun doe?</P>
<P>2. <HI>The second sin of</HI> London <HI>is Vnfruitfulness
in such a fertile soile.</HI> This sin hath been an atten|dant
upon, and a consequent of the former.</P>
<P><HI>London</HI> was not only a <HI>Goshen,</HI> but an <HI>Eden&punc;</HI>
God chose out <HI>London</HI> to be his Garden; he hath
hedged it, planted, watered, prun'd and manur'd
it; no place in the world hath had more plenty
of the means of grace; God hath given the for|mer
and the latter rain, and sweet dews of Hea|ven
both morning and evening did fall upon
<PB N="124" REF="55">
this place, in the morning seed was sown, and
in the evening the hand was not with-drawn;
plentifull and powerfull hath preaching been in
<HI>London,</HI> in season and out of season, on the Sab|bath
day, and on the week day; but hath <HI>Lon|don</HI>
answered all Gods care and cost? hath not
God come for many years together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 13.</NOTE> seeking fruit,
and found nothing but the leaves of profession?
hath he not often threatned to cut down the un|fruitfull
Trees, and not suffer them to cumber
his ground any longer? and when through the in|tercession
of the Vine-dresser, he hath spared
them this year and another year, hath not the
same unfruitfulness still remained? what could
the Lord have done more to his Vine-yard than
he hath done?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 5. 4, 5, 6</NOTE> wherefore then when he looked
for Grapes, brought it forth only leaves, or wilde
Grapes?</P>
<P>And is it then to be wondred at, if the Lord
pluck down the hedge thereof, that it might be
eaten up by the wilde Boar and Beast of the
field, if he break down the wall thereof, and
make it waste and desolate? Is it to be wondred
at, if he with-hold the Clouds that they rain not
on it, and suffer briars and thorns to spring up in
it, where the Plants did grow? The Vine when it
is unfruitful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 15.</NOTE> is the most unuseful of all Trees, it
is fit for nothing but the fire, and the Lord hath
threatned to gather the unfruitfull branches,
and to cast them into the fire and burn them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 15. 6</NOTE>
and the Earth which drinketh in the rain that oft|en
falleth upon it, and instead of herbs meet for
the use of him by whom it is dressed, bringeth
forth nothing but bryars and thorns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 6. 7.</NOTE> God reject|eth
<PB N="125" REF="55">
and curseth, and in the end burneth.</P>
<P>O the unfruitfulness of <HI>London!</HI> O the briars
and thorns which have flourished in this ground,
whereby the seed of the Word hath been choak|ed!
O the hemlock, the thistle, and the worm|wood,
that have sprung up in the furrowes of the
field! O the tares that have abounded and over|topped
the wheat, and how little good Corn hath
there been brought forth! O the wilde Olive
Trees which have grown up in Gods Garden, and
wilde Figges and wilde Grapes, which the Figg-Trees
and Vines of God have yielded unto him!
O the leanness of his sheep in such fat pasture!
O the barrenness! the barrenness! of <HI>London</HI>
under such plentifull showers of the Word! in|stead
of the fruits of righteousness, which are to
the praise and glory of God, there have been the
fruits of unrighteousness and wickedness, which
are to Gods dishonour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 19&punc;24.</NOTE> instead of the fruits of
the spirit, which are love, joy, peace, gentleness,
meekness, temperance, goodness, faith; there
have been the works of the flesh, fornication, un|cleanness,
lasciviousness, hatred, variance, emu|lations,
wraths, strifes, seditions, heresies, envy|ings,
murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such
like; of which the Apostle tells us, that they
which do such things, shall not inherit the King|dome
of God.</P>
<P>And those who have not abounded in the gros|ser
works of the flesh, very few of them have
been very fruitfull in good works. <HI>London</HI> hath
had the means of grace, and yet most of them
without grace, few of them have much grace;
<HI>London</HI> hath had powerfull Ordinances, but
<PB N="126" REF="56">
but what powerful effect have they produced? what
have they to shew of all their Prayers, and Ser|mons,
and Sacraments? have they attained unto
a great measure of mortification? is grace grown
up to a great heighth? what evidences, what ex|periences
have the best got, which they might
have got, had they been more diligent?</P>
<P>Give me leave a little more particularly to
instance the unfruitfulness of <HI>London</HI> in regard
of repentance, faith, love and new obedience,
the fruit which God so much looketh for, and so
much delighteth in.</P>
<P>1. Where have been the fruits of <HI>Repentance</HI>
in <HI>London?</HI> Calls there have been to repentance
frequent, fervent: reason for repentance, sins
numerous, hainous: need of repentance that
judgments temporall, eternall, might be diver|ted,
that pardon, happiness might be obtained:
and yet O the impenitency and hard-heartedness
of <HI>London!</HI> few bleeding hearts under the sharp
sword of the Word; little tenderness under the
most melting discourses; few converts and peni|tent
persons did the most powerful preaching (e|specially
before the Gospels eclipse) bring forth
in <HI>London:</HI> converting work was at a great stand,
though there were so many unconverted persons
in the City: and by the impenitency and hard|ness
of heart in <HI>London,</HI> Gods treasures of wrath
have been filled up, which in some measure he
hath opened in these late judgments, that he hath
inflicted, and yet the great day of his wrath is stil
to come, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 4, 5.</P>
<P>2. Where have been the fruits of <HI>Faith</HI> in
<HI>London?</HI> how hath unbelief abounded, the great
<PB N="127" REF="56">
Gospel sin, more dangerous than any other, and
more hainous in <HI>London</HI> than in any other place?
O the thick vail of unbelief which hath hid Go|spel
mysteries, and things afar off from the eyes
of this people! O the evil heart of unbelief
which hath shut the door against the Lord Jesus
Christ, who hath knocked so long for entertain|ment!
O the sottishness of <HI>London,</HI> to believe
no more, when truths have been made so plain
and clear; when promises have been made known
so great and sure; when Christ hath been preach|ed
and tendered; and when Heaven hath been re|veal'd
and proffered; and when all have such
need, for the most to shut the eye, and ear, and
heart, and through unbelief to refuse! to give
God the lye, and turn upon him the back; to
give Christ a wound, and tread his blood under|foot;
to give the spirit a repulse, and send him a|way
griev'd from the heart, as men do by their
unbelief; this sin doth provoke the Lord to great
displeasure.</P>
<P>3. Where have been the fruits of <HI>love</HI> in
<HI>London?</HI> O the want of love to God, and one to
another! the grace of love is necessary and sweet
and hath been much pressed, but little exercised
in <HI>London;</HI> there hath been much love of the
World, but little love of the Father; hatred of
the brethren hath abounded, but there was little
brotherly love; burning anger there hath been,
litle burning love; burning lusts, litle burning love;
inordinate carnal love, little true spiritual love;
carnal love hath exceeded the bounds, but spiritu|al
love hath been in a very low degree: and when
love in <HI>London</HI> hath waxed cold, is it a wonder if
<PB N="128" REF="57">
Gods anger hath waxed so hot, and broken forth
into such flames, as we have seen?</P>
<P>4. Where have been the fruits of <HI>new obedience</HI>
in <HI>London?</HI> and expression of love to Jesus Christ
by keeping of his commandments, though his
commandments are not grievous?</P>
<P>3. <HI>A third sin of</HI> London, <HI>is hypocrisy in the pro|fession
of religion.</HI> This sin exceedingly prevailed
in the late times, when profession of religion was
grown into fashion: religion was neer in the
mouths of most, but far from the reins: there
was a general face of religion, but it was no more
than skin-deep; It was seated in the countenance,
not rooted in the heart: how many painted se|pulchres
had&punc; we in <HI>London,</HI> outwardly fair and
beautiful, inwardly full of rottenness and wick|edness?
how much sounding brass had we then
in our streets? a great noise and stir hypocrites
did make, but they were hollow at heart; our gold
was most of it counterfeit; water we had instead
of wine, and dross instead of silver.</P>
<P>O how was religion abused! some made it a
stirrop to get up by into the seat of honor; others
made it a cloak to cover their covetous practises;
many base and wicked designes were carried on
under pretence of religion.</P>
<P>It would ask too much time to set forth hypo|crites
in all their shapes, and to paint hypocrisy
in all its colours. <HI>London</HI> hath formerly abound|ed
with hypocrites, and more lately it hath not
been free. If Hell-fire be the portion especial|ly
of hypocrites hereafter, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24. 51. No
wonder then if God be angry with a place for
this sin here.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="57">
4. <HI>The fourth sin of</HI> London, <HI>is Formality and
lukewarmness in the Worship of God.</HI> There was
much formality when there was no Form; and
I suppose that Forms have not quickned unto
more liveliness; there was a face of Worship in|deed
in <HI>London;</HI> and was there not only, or little
more than a Face in most places? God is Holy
and Jealous, <HI>a great King, and his Name is dread|ful,</HI>
Mal. 1. 14. <HI>God is a Spirit, and they that wor|ship
him, must worship him in spirit and in truth,</HI>
Joh. 4. 24. But hath his Worship been accord|ingly
in <HI>London?</HI> hath there been that spiritual
Worship which he requires? Let <HI>London</HI> seri|ously
reflect upon their carriage towards God
in their Devotions; have they had a due awe
and dread of the great Name of God upon them,
when they have seemed to draw neer unto him?
have they worshipped him with reverence and
godly fear? outward reverence some have used,
more than he hath required, in bowing at Names
and before Places; but have they had inward
reverence and fear of God upon their hearts?
have they cloathed themselves with Humility,
when they have come into his presence? hath
there been inward fervour and delight accom|panying
their outward acts of Worship?</P>
<P>Alas! how <HI>formal</HI> hath <HI>London</HI> been, especially
of late in Gods Worship? they have prayed, but
what kinde of Prayers have they been? could
they deserve the name of Prayers? were those
prayers likely to prevent Judgement, or turn
away wrath? some Confessions of sin have been
<PB N="130" REF="58">
made, but so generall and formall, that they
have been very unlikely to work up the heart
to sorrow and repentance: and where some
have been more particular, hath not much for|mality
cleaved to them? where hath hearty grief
for sin, and sorrow been to be found? would
not a small Viol hold all the tears that have dropt
from the eyes of great Assemblies, even in the
day of their most solemn Humiliations? hath
not sin been rolled under the tongue, when
Confession of sin hath been at the end of it?
Have not the Confessions of many been such as
if they came to ask leave to commit sin, rather
than humbly to bewail it? at least have they not
taken leave, whatever their Confessions have
been? Petitions have been made for <HI>pardon,</HI> and
<HI>grace,</HI> and <HI>sanctification,</HI> but hath it not been Lip|prayer,
without hearty desire? hath it not been
in such a manner, as if they did not much care
whether they did speed or no? as if they could
make shift well enough without a Pardon? as
if they had no need of Grace and Holiness; but
they must say something for Form and Custom?
hath there not been an <HI>enmity</HI> in the hearts of
many against that which they have seemed to
desire with their lips? <HI>Who</HI> have stirr'd up them|selves
to lay hold on God? <HI>Who</HI> have wrestled
in Prayer with fervent desires, with Faith, and
Importunity? Hearing there hath been in <HI>Lon|don;</HI>
but how little Believing? how little re|lishing
the Word, and receiving it with Love?
Singing there hath been, but how little Joy and
Melody of the heart in the Lord?</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="58">
O how <HI>formal</HI> and <HI>lukewarm</HI> hath <HI>London</HI>
been? how much of the <HI>Laodicean</HI> temper have
they had in all Ordinances? And might not God
say to <HI>London,</HI> as he did of old to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> Isa.
1. 11, 12, 13, 14. <HI>To what purpose is the multitude
of your sacrifices unto me?</HI> &amp;c. Such services are
to no purpose; they are vain Worship, and do
not attain the end thereof, either to profit him
that offereth them, or to please him unto whom
they are tendered; can such formal services be
effectual to procure <HI>pardon</HI> or <HI>peace?</HI> can they
bear up the spirit in a day of trouble? will not
the Morning cloud and early dew of such Righ|teousness
flee away and vanish upon the ap|proach
of the Sun? will not such Spiders webs
be broken to pieces by a stormy winde? how do
Formalists behave themselves as if they had no
Religion when they fall into trouble? when God
thunders by his Judgements, what can a cold,
formal, empty prayer do? when Death appears
before them with a grim countenance, what
comfort can such reap by reflection on such ser|vices?
what Evidences for Heaven can they
gather from any of their outside Devotions?</P>
<P>And are not they to as little purpose in regard
of God? may not God say unto them of their
Fastings and Prayers, <HI>Did you fast unto me? did
you pray at all unto me?</HI> Zach. 7. 5. Or as here
to the <HI>Iews,</HI> That he was <HI>full</HI> of their Services,
even to a loathing; that he took no delight in
them, and <HI>who hath required these things at your
hands to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain
Oblations, Incense is an abomination unto me, I
cannot away with your Assemblies, my soul hateth
<PB N="132" REF="59">
them, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear
them.</HI> The Lord is much offended with formal,
hypocritical Services; hereby they flatter and
mock him, and is he taken with flatteries? Such
services are like a dead, cold, black, mangled,
rotten, stinking Carkase without the Soul and
spirit, which must needs be very unsavoury and
displeasing; they are like the lame, blinde, halt,
sick Cattel, which were not fit to be offered up
in Sacrifice under the Law, <HI>Mal. 1. 8. If ye of|fer
the blinde for Sacrifice, is it not evil? and if
ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Offer
it now unto thy Governour, will he be pleased
with thee?</HI> And will God then be pleased?
Such persons when they seem to serve God with
their Outward man, they serve the Devil and
their own lusts with their Inward man; God
hath the Form sometimes, the Devil hath the
Power; God hath the show, the Devil hath the
substance; God hath the bark, the rinde, the
shell, the Devil hath the kernel; God hath the
Cabinet, the Devil gets the Jewel; they give
God the Devils leavings and refuse as it were
of their own lust; for they spend the strength
and vigour of soul and body in serving the
Devil, and gratifying their own lusts; and then
think to put God off with any thing; giveing
him only some dead, cold, faint, empty,
heartless, lifeless, outward services; and even in
them they are sweyed by some carnal Motives,
which are the secret spring to the wheel of all
external services. And O how abominable is
all such Worship in the sight of God? Hath not
Formality in Worship, been one sin of <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="59">
which hath helpt to fill up the Ephah? when
the means God hath appointed for the turning
away of his anger is used in such a manner that
it self becomes a provocation, no wonder if his
wrath break forth without remedy.</P>
<P>5. <HI>A fifth sin of</HI> London <HI>is Division amongst
Professors;</HI> different perswasions have made wide
breaches and divisions in <HI>London,</HI> and through
Divisions have arisen great animosities and con|tentions,
unto the shame of Christianity and the
Protestant Religion; and hath not God been pro|voked
to anger hereby? hath not he contended
with Professours, and by the common scourge he
hath brought upon them, called aloud unto them
for a union, and more hearty accord and affection
then formerly they have had? and hath not he
given them liberty and opportunity, had they
minded and cared to make use of it, for meeting
together in order unto healing? but have pro|fessours
of different parties been sensible of Gods
meaning in the scourge upon their backs? have
they hearkened unto Gods call? have they
laid hold of, and improved opportunities for
closing up their wide breaches? I hope some
closing in affection there hath been amongst
some; but how rarely hath it been to be found?
and when there are such breaches still amongst
us, is it not just with God to make further breach|es
upon us, as he hath done by his judgements?</P>

<P>1. Who in <HI>London</HI> have seriously and very di|ligently
endeavoured the Reformation of their
<HI>hearts?</HI> when so unclean, and polluted, who
have laboured to get them washed? when such
roots of bitterness have been springing forth, and
such weeds of Lust have been growing there,
who hath endeavoured to pluck them up? out|ward
neatness there hath been in <HI>London,</HI> washing,
and rincing, rubbing and scowring; but O the in|ward
sluttishness! they who have had clean houses,
and clean garments, and clean faces and hands,
have had foul hearts: who have taken care
every day to rince and scowre their inside? to
bring their hearts to the fountain set open for
sin and uncleanness; and to cleanse themselves
from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, that they
might arrive every day unto greater perfection in
holiness? they who have been careful to dress
their bodies every day, have been very careless
in dressing their hearts, neglecting to put on the
white robes of Christs righteousness which alone
can cover their spiritual nakedness and defor|mity;
and to get the jewels of grace, which
alone can adorn the soul, and render it amiable
in the sight of God.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="60">
<HI>Heart work, is hard work;</HI> and it is so hard
that most have let it alone; they have been dis|couraged
with the difficulty; the opposition of
Sathan and Lust to this work hath been so strong,
that they have been quickly overpowered upon
their first attempts and endeavours after a change
and rectifying of the disorders, which they have
perceived.</P>
<P><HI>Heart work,</HI> is <HI>secret work;</HI> many have em|ployed
themselves in the more open work of
religion; few have taken pains with their hearts
in secret; many take heed to their tongues,
what they speak, and before whom; to their
hands, what they do; to their feet, whither they
go; but few take heed to their hearts&punc; Murder,
Adultery, Theft, and the like sins have been
committed in the heart by many, who would
have been afraid and ashamed of the outward
acts.</P>
<P>O the unwatchfulness there hath been in <HI>Lon|don</HI>
over the heart! Citizens have watched
their gates, and watched their streets, and watch|ed
their houses; but how few have watched
their hearts, what cometh in, and what goeth
forth? how few have set a watch before the door
of their lips, and ears, and other senses, which are
the inlets of sin; and upon their hearts, from
whence are the issues of sin? how few have
kept their hearts with all diligence? how few
have laboured to govern their thoughts, to rule
their passions, to subjugate their wills to Christ,
and to deliver up all their affections to his di|spose
and obedience? Heart reformation hath
been much neglected.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="61">
2. Who in <HI>London</HI> have endeavoured <HI>Life-Re|formation</HI>
as they should? how few have there
been effectually perswaded to put away the evil
of their doings from before the eyes of the
Lord, to cease from evil, and have learned to
do well? How few have broken off their sins
by Repentance, and throughly amended their
ways, measuring out their actions, by the Rule
of the word? how few have got the Law of
God written in their hearts, and the transcript
thereof in their lives, exemplifying the precepts
thereof in their conversations? how few in
<HI>London</HI> have been like so many <HI>Epistles</HI> of Christ,
in whom the will and grace of their Master
might be read? who have troden in Christs steps,
walking as he walked, and followed him in the
way of obedience and self-denyal? who have
shined like so many lights in dark places and
times, adorning their profession, and living as
becometh the Gospel?</P>
<P>Great irregularities there have been in the
lives of most Londoners, little Gospel-reforma|tion;
little making Religion the business; little
holy exact living. If a stranger had looked into
our City, and observed the lives of the most, and
not known them to have had the name of Chri|stians,
would not he have judged them to be
Heathens, yea many of them in their dealing to
be worse then Turks and Infidels? Thus Perso|nal
Reformation hath been neglected.</P>
<P>2. A great neglect there hath been of <HI>family
reformation</HI> in <HI>London;</HI> How few have with
<HI>Ioshuah</HI> resolved, and accordingly endeavoured
that they and their houses should serve the
<PB N="137" REF="61">
Lord? how few have set up Religious worship
in their families? have not many hundred houses
in the City been without family-prayer in them
from one end of the week to the other? and is
it strange that the Lord hath burned down those
houses, wherein the inhabitants would not vouch|safe
to worship him? And where there hath been
some prayer in many families, it was but once
a day, and that so late at night, and when the
body hath been so tryed, and sleepy, and the soul
so dull, and unfit for Gods service, that the pray|ers
have been no prayers, or lost prayers, such,
which instead of pleasing him, have provoked
him to anger? how few did labour to instruct
their families; Catechize their children and ser|vants,
to bring them up in the nurture and ad|monition
of the Lord? hath not God threatned
to pour out his wrath upon irreligious families?
<HI>Ier.</HI> 10. 25.</P>
<P>3. Neglect of <HI>City-reformation;</HI> have not the
Magistrates of <HI>London</HI> been faulty here? let them
ask their own consciences, whether to the utter|most
of their power according to the trust and
opportunity the Lord hath put into their hands,
they have endeavoured the Reformation of the
City? whether as Gods under-officers, they
have improved their interest for the promotion
of Religion in the zealous exercise of it? yea whe|ther
they have put the Laws made, in execution
against Sabbath-breakers, swearers, drunkards,
endeavouring to find out and punish such of|fenders?</P>
<P>4. Neglect of <HI>Church-reformation;</HI> And is
there no blame to be laid upon Church-officers?
<PB N="138" REF="62">
hath there been that zeal for, and faithful execu|tion
of Church-discipline according to the Rules

been affronted in his Kingly office by some, who

consciences, instead of vigorously endeavouring
the execution of his; and taken the power of
the Keyes out of the hands of those unto whom
the Lord hath entrusted it, hereby rendring the
execution of discipline impossible according to
the Laws of Christ? have not the tender and

in their Pulpits at holiness and zealous profes|sion;
which they have seconded by a conver|sation
of dissoluteness, malitious opposition
and persecution of those especially who have
been the most religious? Sad neglects there
have been of reformation in <HI>London;</HI> and that
when <HI>London</HI> lay under such obligations to re|form:
as Christians they were obliged by bap|tismal
and renewed vows: as Protestants of
the Reformed religion, they were obliged to
endeavour a reformation: by Mercies they
were obliged; an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter"> have they been under no
other obligations? And hath not the neglect of
reformation, notwithstanding all obligations,
rendred them guilty of disingenuity, infideliy,
yea of perjury it self? I verily believe
<PB N="139" REF="62">
this is the great sin God is scourging <HI>London</HI>
for; God is contending for a Reformation;
and if they do not endeavour it more vigorously
the sooner, I fear he will bring desolation upon
them.</P>
<P>7. <HI>A seventh sin of</HI> London, <HI>is fearful Aposta|cy,
and a spirit of complyance with the sins of the
times.</HI> How many in <HI>London</HI> who formerly
were great profestours, have discovered them|selves
to be rotten hypocrites? who casting off
the sheeps clothing, and laying aside all pro|fession,
have given themselves up to disso|luteness,
and licentious living? formerly they
have seemed true penitents, and to be washed
from their iniquities; but they have returned
with the dogg to the vomit, and with the Sow
that is washed to the wallowing in the mire,
2 <HI>Pet. 2. ult.</HI> formerly they have been swept a
little within; and garnisht outwardly with
a fair profession; but the unclean spirit hath re|turned,
and without any great difficulty hath
entered with seven worse spirits, and defiled
them more then before, and made their last
state worse then their first.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 12. 43, 44, 45.</NOTE> I speak not so
much of those who worship God in this Mode
or that Mode, and of alterations herein; but
of those who sometimes professed religion, and
now do not worship God in any mode at all,
but wholly addict themselves to their lusts,
and are ashamed to be called, or thought to
be religious.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="63">
They would not now look like a Saint, or
speak like a Saint, much less live like a Saint.
Thus have many in our dayes cast off all fear of
God, and devoted themselves with the Hell|hounds
of the times to the service of the Devil;
resolving to do what in them lies to promote
the interest of his Kingdom. And if some are
a little more aukward in his service, and not al|together
so like him, and such apt Scholars pre|sently,
as others whose education hath been in
his School from their childhood, yet they learn
very fast, and wonderfull is their proficiency in
a short time; and in regard of Apostacy they
come neerer the Image of the Devil, than those
that have been alwayes tutor'd by him.</P>
<P>Now for any in <HI>London</HI> to forsake God, that
they might serve the Devil; to draw off from
the wayes of Holiness, that they might walk
in the wayes of Wickedness; doth cast a great
slurr upon God and his wayes. They do in ef|fect
say, That the Devil is a better Master than
God; and that the way of sin that leadeth to
Hell is more eligible than the way of Holiness,
which alone can bring to Heaven. The Lord
threatneth, that his Soul shall have no pleasure
in such Apostates, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 38. It is a <HI>Meiosis,</HI>
and we are to understand, that the Lord is high|ly
displeased with such persons.</P>
<P><HI>See how God pleads with Apostatizing</HI> Israel,
Ier. 2. 9, 10, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Wherefore I will yet plead with
you, saith the Lord. Pass ye over to the Isles of <HI>Chit|tim,</HI>
and see, and send unto <HI>Kedar,</HI> and diligent|ly
consider, if there be any such thing? Hath any
Nation changed their gods, which yet are no gods?
<PB N="141" REF="63">
But my people have changed their glory for that which
doth not profit! Be astonished O ye Heavens at this,
and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the
Lord; for my people have committed two great evils;
they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters,
and have hewen out unto themselves broken cisterns,
that can hold no water: <HI>And hence follows,</HI> v. 15.
The young lions roared and yelled upon him, and laid
his land waste; his Cities are burnt without inha|bitant:
<HI>and v.</HI> 17. Thou hast procured these things
unto thy self, because thou hast forsaken the Lord thy
God: <HI>and v.</HI> 19. Thy own wickedness shall correct
thee, and thy back-slidings shall reprove thee; know
therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter,
that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that
my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts.
<HI>And may not God thus plead with the Apostates
of</HI> London, <HI>and punish them as he did his people
of</HI> Israel?</P>
<P>8. <HI>The Eighth sin of</HI> London <HI>is deafning the Ear
against all Gods Calls.</HI> The Lord hath called
upon <HI>London</HI> by his Ministers, but they have
been like the deaf Adder which will not hearken
to the voice of the Charmer; they have stopped
their ears, and turned away their shoulder, and
made their heart like an Adamant stone. God
hath called by his Mercies; but this voice hath
been too low, and they have slept the more se|curely
in sin. God after other Means hath called
by Afflictions, first lighter, then heavier; and
yet how many in <HI>London</HI> have, and still do walk
contrary unto God, and will not return to him
<PB N="142" REF="64">
that hath smitten them? They have been incor|rigible
under all Gods correcting Rods. When
God spake by the Plague, they were a little a|wakened,
but quickly dropt asleep again; when
the plague was a little over, they return to their
Trades again, to their sins again, but they do
not return unto the Lord. And when the Judge|ment
of the Plague was so much lost and inef|fectual
for their good; this no doubt hath provo|ked
God so quickly and unexpectedly to turn
his hand upon them, and bring the Judgement of
the Fire; and if they will still walk contrary
to God, they must expect that God will walk
contrary to them, untill he have consumed
them.</P>
<P>9. <HI>A Ninth sin of</HI> London <HI>is Profaneness, and
a loose and frothy spirit, especially in the Youth and
springing generation.</HI> I do not tax all; for I am
confident there is a serious and godly Youth
growing up. But O that there were not reason
to say, that the generality of Youth is profane
and wicked, as well as those who are grown
more mature in wickedness! And this Profane|ness
hath shewed it self
<LIST>
<HEAD>In</HEAD>
<ITEM>1 Profane using Gods Name.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Profane breaking of Gods Day.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Profane scoffing at Gods People.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>1. <HI>In profane using of Gods Name.</HI> How grosly
hath the third Commandment been broken in the
City? how hath the great and dreadfull Name
<PB N="143" REF="64">
of the Lord God, which should make men to
tremble in the mention of it, and command
their spirits into aw and reverence, been vainly
taken by many, and used to fill up the sen|tence
of their ordinary discourse? And not only
so; but how hath the Name of God been tossed
in the black mouths of the Children of darkness,
and even torn in pieces by their hideous Oaths
and Execrations? What an hellish noyse hath
the sound of full-mouth'd Oaths, made some|times
in the streets; enough to make the hair
stand on end, of one who hath a sence of the
greatness of that Majesty upon his spirit, which
hereby is so audaciously affronted? Oh the
Swearing that hath been used by <HI>Londoners</HI>
in buying and selling! Many Parents have been
so addicted to this sin in their Families, that
their little Children have no sooner learned to
speak, but they have also learned of them to
swear by the Name of God, which hath been
all the teaching of God that they have given
them; a devilish teaching indeed; which here|after
they will curse and bann them for in
Hell.</P>
<P>But if you should have laid your ears unto
the Taverns, and Ale-houses, and Whore-houses,
and other Devil-houses once standing in <HI>London;</HI>
and harkened to the speeches of many of the
Devils Imps, in their drinking and gaming, and
other lewd practises, especially when a little cross'd
and vexed; Oh what language of Hell might
have been heard! How have those cursed Vil|lains,
in the heat of their wine and anger, shot
vollies of Oaths in the face of the God of Hea|ven!
<PB N="144" REF="65">
and whetting their tongues like a sharp
sword, they have not feared to wound the name
of God, when they have received any injury
from men. O what poyson of Asps hath there
been under their lips? but a worse poyson of sin
in their hearts, from the evil treasure and abun|dance
of which, these oaths and blasphemies have
proceeded.</P>
<P>But who can find words to set forth the evil
of this sin, which hath not the temptation of
pleasure, advantage or honour, as other sins
have; and therefore is a great argument of a
monstrous wicked heart? And who can ex|press
Gods displeasure for this sin, for which he
makes sometimes a whole land to mourn?
And hath not this sin provoked the Lord to
utter his angry voice in Plaguing and burning
the City, that they might fear to abuse his
Name any more?</P>
<P>2. <HI>In profanc breaking of Gods day.</HI> Sabbath
breaking was an ordinary sin in <HI>London.</HI> I say
not, it was so much broken in doing the ordinary
works of the particular callings, but in that which
was worse: How many did spend the Sabbath
in eating to excess, and drinking till they were
drunk, in sleeping, in walking into the fields, in
sports and recreations? Many wholly neglected
the worship of God on that day; and instead of
that, did the Devil more service on the Lords
day, then all the days of the week besides.</P>
<P>The many weeks of Sabbaths which <HI>London</HI>
had in the time of the Plague, methinks did re|prove
<HI>London</HI> for their profaning of the weekly
Sabbath: And the great fire, (I will not call it
<PB N="145" REF="65">
bon-fire because so destructive to <HI>London.</HI>) which
was begun in the City on the Lords day did re|prove
<HI>London</HI> for those lesser fires, (I will not
call them bon-fires because so offensive to God)
which not long before were kindled in the streets
on that day which called for other kind of work.
Not to speak any thing whether there were any
just occasion for those fires and ringing of bells,
(most of which were melted before they were
rung so generally again) and such a shew of
mirth and rejoycing at that time.</P>
<P>The Citizens carrying forth their goods, and
lying in the fields, with grief and fear, might
put them in mind how often they had walked
out into those fields on the Lords day for their
recreation; when they should rather have been
hearing the word preached, or if that were
over, repeating it in their own families, giving
and receiving instruction, or in their closets at
the throne of grace, or employed in meditation.
As God delights in those that call his Sabbaths
a delight, and makes sweet promises to them;
so he is highly displeased with Sabbath breakers,
and hath denounced severe threatnings against
them, Jer. 17. 27. <HI>If ye will not hearken to me
to hallow the Sabbath day; I will kindle a fire in
the gates of</HI> Jerusalem <HI>which shall devour the
Palaces thereof, and shall not he quenched.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>In profane scoffing at Gods people.</HI> The name
of a Saint, and Godly man, hath been ridicu|lous
to many prophane Spirits in <HI>London,</HI> and
used by them in a way of reproach. How have
Gods people, especially the more strict and zea|lous,
been made the drunkards song, and laughed
<PB N="146" REF="66">
at in the streets? Horrid impiety! as if it
were matter of more shame to be like the
Holy God, than to be like the Foul Devill!
and to be employed in the work of angels, than
to drudge in Satans chains!</P>
<P>No wonder if God is angry with such a place
where such vipers have had their abode: Pro|phaness
is a great sin that hath brought ruine
upon us.</P>
<P>10. <HI>A tenth sin of</HI> London <HI>is Pride.</HI> This sin
being so odious to God; so destructive where
it abounds; and so universal in <HI>London;</HI> I shall
speak of it the more largely, both in regard of
the inward workings, and the outward expres|sions
of it: which when opened, I believe there
are none that will be able to say they are wholly
free from it.</P>
<P>1. <HI>In regard of the inward workings of pride.</HI>
Oh how hath the poison of this sin envenomed
the spirits of the most in a very high degree?
How many self-admirers have there been in
<HI>London,</HI> who have been puft up with an over|weening
conceit of their own excellencies?
What high, touring, swelling thoughts have
they had of themselves? What secret self-pleas|ing,
and lifting up themselves in their own
esteem? Some esteeming themselves for that
which is matter of shame; admiring themselves
for their own wit and parts, when they have lain
fallow, and not been employed for God, or when
they have been employed to his dishonour:
when they have been wise, but it hath been to
<PB N="147" REF="66">
do evil: when they have been men of under|standing,
but it hath been to practise iniquity:
when they have had cunning craftiness, but it
hath been to deceive, to defraud and over-reach;
or to plot and contrive others mischief; when
they have had a ripe wit, quick understanding,
rich fancy, fluency of speech; but the employ|ment
hath been about toyes and trifles, or that
which is worse; when the vent hath been in
foolish, empty complements and courtship, jest|ing
with Scripture, scoffing at the religious, or
in dirty and obscene discourses.</P>
<P>Others have admired themselves, for that
which really they never had but only in their
own imagination. Some for their parts and
learning; thinking themselves great schollars
when none have thought so but themselves:
others for their grace and godliness, when their
silver hath been dross; and their grace either
counterfeit in whole, or so mixed with unper|ceived
corruption, that upon examination they
might find themselves very poor, in that which
they thought themselves so much enriched with;
and if they looked to the root and principle of
their actions, they might find great flaws, and
deficiency in those things which they had the
highest conceit of.</P>
<P>How many in <HI>London</HI> have had very honour|able
esteem of themselves; preferring them|selves
above others, yea above the whole world?
Few have measured themselves by the rule, but
measured themselves by their own fancies, or
by other mens esteem. How many have thought
themselves to be something, when they have
<PB N="148" REF="67">
been nothing, and rejoyced in their actions as ex|cellent,
and admirable, not from their own proof
and tryal of them by the word, but from others
acceptation and commendations, and by com|paring
them with the actions of other men,
whom they have conceited themselves to ex|ceed?
O how have some lifted up themselves
above others, looking upon themselves as far
more worthy without any reall ground? their
eye hath been upon their own good things,
overlooking the secret evil, because it cannot be
seen by men: and their eye hath been upon
others evil things; overlooking the good which
hath been out of ready view: their eye hath
been upon their own best things, and upon others
worst things, aggravating their faults, and ex|tenuating
their own. Thus they have in their
thoughts brought others down through uncha|ritableness,
and lifted up themselves upon the ru|ines,
which their uncharitableness hath made in
others worth: and when they have had greater
esteem because of their greater shew, this opini|on
of themselves hath been confirmed; whereas
in truth, others who made less shew, and had
less esteem, have had more sincerity, and secret
hidden excellency.</P>
<P>I might further trace the inward workings
of pride in the self-love which it hath effected;
What a marvelous affection have proud persons
had towards themselves, notwithstanding their
ugliness, and spiritual deformity, the rottenness
and corruption within them? and many lusts of
their hearts? all which pride hath covered and a
thousand faults in themselves; as charity doth
<PB N="149" REF="67">
cover a thousand faults in others: Pride hath
put a fair gloss and Varnish upon all, and re|presented
men to themselves as very lovely and
amiable. Pride also hath chosen for such, their
friends, who have been loved, not according to
the worth which those persons have had, but
according to the estimation those persons have
had of their worth; which if those have fallen
in estimation, these have fallen in affecti|on.</P>
<P>I might shew the workings of Pride, in the
hatred, anger, spight, revenge which it hath ef|fected,
when it hath met with disesteem or slight|ing:
the grief at the substraction of its fuel, and
provision; the sollicitous thoughts, and cares con|cerning,
and eager progging, and pursuit after
others commendations; the storm of commotion
and disturbance which this winde hath raised,
when the tide of Applause hath run another way:
the complacency and delight it hath yielded in
drinking out of a full stream of others esteem,
in chewing the Cud, and revolving in the minde
the praise of men. But so much concerning the
inward workings of Pride.</P>
<P>2. Concerning the Outward expressions of Pride,
<HI>and that,</HI></P>
<P>1. In the <HI>Speech: London</HI> hath been grosly
guilty in Boasting and Vain-glory. What com|pany
could you come into almost, but you should
finde many boasting spirits? some foaming out
the shame of their own praise, in high expressi|ons,
and direct self-commendations (without any
regard to Gods glory, self-vindication, example,
or excitement; in which cases, modestly and
<PB N="150" REF="68">
sparingly, to do it may be lawfull and a duty)
but they have done it only to be well thought
on, and admired: Others driveling out their
own praises more sliely and indirectly; but a
Christian of eyes and brains, might easily per|ceive
that the drift and scope of the discourse
hath been Self, and a tacit begging of a good
opinion. As if one should say, <HI>Pray friends,
think a little better of me; pray have me higher in
your esteem; for to say the truth, by this I give you
to understand that I am a very worthy person.</HI>
Many we shall finde very forward to declare
their own goodness, but few faithfull in speak|ing
forth the praises of God; yea many there
have been who have discommended themselves,
not that they might fall, but rise in esteem.
Thus some rotten-hearted hypocrites as full of
pride as they can hold, and some sincere in the
main, yet too much like them, have spoken so
meanly of themselves, and so much against
themselves as none other would do; and what
hath been the design? even that they might be
accounted humble: and therefore they have ta|ken
care in their self-commendations, to speak
of nothing but common infirmities, concealing
their more gross faults; and those common in|firmities,
in a mourning and complaining way,
as if they were very sensible of them; as if af|fected,
afflicted, and burthened with them (as
the humble, sincere Christian is indeed) that they
might be esteemed for sensibility of small faults;
and then they have taken care to do it, not to
those that are more rigid, severe and quicksighted
Christians, that would quickly have smelt out
<PB N="151" REF="68">
their pride; but unto those, which they have
lookt upon as the most tender, charitable per|sons,
who are ready hereby to advance them
higher in esteem; or weaker Christians, who
are ready to confess more evil of themselves.
And when they have thus spoken against them|selves,
they have not really thought so, but the
contrary; but they have spoken so, that they
might be contradicted, and commended to their
faces; if they thought they should have fallen
in esteem by such words, they would have held
their peace, but because they supposed discom|mendation
might most effectually promote
esteem, and draw out a good word, therefore
they have used it. Proud Hypocrites speak ill
of themselves that they may be accounted hum|ble;
they cannot endure to be humble; they
care not for the grace, yea they hate it; yet they
would be thought to have it, because it doth pro|mote
esteem: they love the reward of humility,
but they care not for humility it self, they love
humility in others, because such persons will
stoop to them; but they love not humility in
themselves, for they will stoop to none.</P>
<P>Thus some also out of a secret design of pride
have discommended others behinde their backs,
that they might be thought to exceed them,
whom they could correct, and finde fault with|all;
they have laboured to bring down others
that they might set up themselves. And the same
design of Pride they have had in commending
others to their faces, and exalting them in words
above themselves, not from a reall esteem which
they have had of them above themselves, but
<PB N="152" REF="69">
only that they might draw forth a commenda|tion
from them.</P>
<P>Such expressions of pride have been to be found
in Professors, and have been more latent; but
I shall speak of the more gross and open expres|sions,
which have been generall in the City. We
read of the pride of the Daughters of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI>
Isa. 3. 16, &amp;c. <HI>They were haughty, and walked with
stretched forth necks, and wanton eyes, walking and
mincing as they went, and making a tinckling with
their feet:</HI> and what was it they were proud of?
See from <HI>v.</HI> 18. to <HI>v. 25. Their ornaments, their
Cauls, their Tires, their Chains, their Bracelets,
their Mufflers, their Tablets, their Head-bands,
their Rings, their Iewels, their changeable suits of
Apparel,</HI> and the like. And hath there not been
this pride in <HI>London?</HI> Were not the Daughters
of <HI>London</HI> like the Daughters of <HI>Zion</HI> for pride,
and haughtiness? Was there any place in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
that could shew such pride of Apparel as
<HI>London</HI> could shew, which the Female sex were
not only guilty of? Was there any fashion, though
never so antick and apish, which <HI>London</HI> did
not presently imitate? Who can count the
Cost which hath been lavished out in Cloath|ing,
and rich Apparel? some pinching their
Bellies and Families to lay it out on this
Lust.</P>
<P>This Pride of Apparel is very shamefull and
absurd, Cloaths being the Badge of Apostasie,
which were not made use of till after the fall,
therefore the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> which signifies Cloath|ing,
comes from <GAP DESC="foreign"> He <HI>prevaricated;</HI> and it is
as if a Thief should be proud of his Shackles, or
<PB N="153" REF="69">
any Malefactor of his mark of disgrace: At least
the gaudy attire of many persons hath signified
the emptiness and frothy minde within; and that
they have had nothing to set them forth but
their Cloaths.</P>
<P>I might also add; the <HI>pride,</HI> which the daugh|ters
of <HI>London</HI> have had of their Beauty, though
it be but skin-deep, and the Body but a skin|full
of dirt, and the choycest beauty without
discretion, like a Jewel hanged at the ear or nose
of a Swine: And the Lord knows what mon|strous,
and defiled, and deformed insides, the
most of those have had, who have been so fair
and adorned outwardly. Many in <HI>London</HI> have
been proud of their fine cloaths and fair faces;
and others of their fair Shops, and stately houses;
Pride has hung about the neck like a Chain, and
covered them like a garment, instead of the
cloathing and Ornament of Humility, which be|fore
God is of so great price.</P>
<P>Now God is highly offended with the sin of
Pride, <HI>God resisteth the proud,</HI> 1 Pet. 5. 5. <GAP DESC="foreign">,
he doth as it were set himself
in battell array against them. <HI>Pride goes before
destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall,</HI>
Prov. 16. 18. Pride was one of <HI>Sodoms</HI> sins,
which City was burnt with fire from Heaven,
<HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 49. The Scriptures speak of Three Ci|ties
that were burnt for this sin of pride among
other sins, namely <HI>Sodom, Ierusalem,</HI> and <HI>Baby|lon:</HI>
And may not <HI>London</HI> come in for a fourth?
The botches, and blains, and loathsome sores in
the bodies of many, when the Plague was in
<HI>London;</HI> and the burning of so much fewel of
<PB N="154" REF="70">
pride, by the Fire, methinks were a very loud
reproof and rebuke of <HI>London</HI> for this sin.</P>
<P>11. <HI>An eleventh sin of</HI> London, <HI>is fullness of
Bread, or intemperance in eating:</HI> this was ano|ther
of the sins of <HI>Sodom.</HI> God did feed <HI>London</HI>
with the finest of the Wheat, and gave plenty of
Corn, and Flesh, and other Provisions; but how
have they abused Plenty by their Intemperance
and Luxury? O the excessive Feasting in Halls,
and private Houses of them whose Estates have
been more plentifull! What indulging hath
there been to the Appetite, as if self-denyal in
regard of the Appetite were no duty, or an
enemy, and with the Poor to be shut out of
doors? What curiosity of Palat, and daintiness
have many in <HI>London</HI> had, so that Air, Earth,
Sea, must be ransackt to please them, and all
would not do? What loathing have they had of
ordinary food? Many good creatures of God
must be cut and mangled, and spoyled, to make
them new dishes; which however pleasing, have
but spoyled their stomachs, and bred diseases in
their bodies. Some have not eaten much, but
have been so choice, that scarce any food hath
pleased them; and that not, through sickness of
body, but wantonness of mind: others have
been pleased with their food and overpleased,
and all their pleasure hath been therein; <HI>All whose
God,</HI> as the Apostle speaks, Phil. 3. <HI>hath been their
belly.</HI> Such like the Rich man, Luk. 16. 19. <HI>have
fared sumptuously and deliciously every day;</HI> O the
excessive cost that some have bestowed upon their
<PB N="155" REF="70">
Tables daily! O the excessive quantity of Meat
that some have devoured! O the excessive time
that hath been wasted in pampering the flesh!
What rioting and banqueting hath there been
daily in <HI>London,</HI> many feeding themselves with|out
fear; as if gluttony were not any sin at all?
How many have been like fed Horses in the Ci|ty,
or like fatted Oxen, who as the Apostle <HI>Iames</HI>
speaks, <HI>have lived in pleasure and been wanton,
and nourished themselves as in a day of slaughter,</HI>
Jam. 5. 5. and as <HI>Hos. 13. 6. According to their
pasture so were they filled; they were filled, and
their heart was exalted, therefore have they forgot|ten
Me.</HI></P>
<P>This kinde of Intemperance hath so strangely
brutified many, that they have been even dege|nerated
into Beasts, only that they have been
more unusefull; for hereby they have unfitted
themselves for all kinde of service, as if they
were born only to eat: but withall they have
prepared themselves for those ruining and
slaughtering Judgements which have come upon
the City.</P>
<P>12. <HI>A twelfth sin of</HI> London <HI>is Idleness;</HI> a con|sequent
of the former; only that Idleness hath
been more generall: this was also a sin of <HI>Sodom;</HI>
I will not say but many Citizens of <HI>London</HI> were
diligent in their Calling, but how many idle
Vagrant persons were there in the City? What
Idleness in many of the Youth, if not held in
the more strictly, and some breaking forth, and
lavishing away stollen time, which was not at
<PB N="156" REF="71">
their own dispose whatever strictness was used?
Moreover what an ill example for idleness, did
many Governours themselves give to their chil|dren
and servants? When Masters were idle
abroad, no wonder that Servants were idle at
home; when Mistresses were idle in their Cham|bers,
no wonder if the Kitchin did imitate.</P>
<P>Though eating, and drinking, and cloathing
were necessary, and called for some time; yet the
excess of time spent about these things, if not
worse, was no better than idle time. Many
especially of the Females in the City have spent
so much time in the Morning in their beds, if
not in sleeping, at least in idle foolish Fancies,
and so much time after in neat and curious dres|sing
their bodies, that they have had no time
before Dinner for Prayer or Reading, no time
to dress their Souls: and the Afternoon being
far spent in eating and drinking, the rest of the
time hath run away either in Visitings or Enter|tainments,
wherein (if not worse) vain, idle, un|profitable
things have been the chief, if not the
only subject of their discourse: and by that time
they have again refreshed themselves with food
at night, they have been too sleepy and unfit for
Prayer, and the Service of God. And thus ma|ny
careless Women in the City have lived in ease
and idleness from one end of the Week, and one
end of the Year unto another. But methinks the
Lord hath by his terrible things in <HI>London,</HI> spo|ken
unto them much in the same language as
he did, Isa. 32. 9, 10, 11. <HI>Rise up ye Women that
are at ease, hear my voice ye careless Daughters,
give ear to my speech; many dayes and years shall ye
<PB N="157" REF="71">
be troubled ye careless Women: tremble ye Women
that are at ease, be troubled ye careless ones, strip
ye, make ye bare, and gird sackcloth upon your
loyns.</HI></P>
<P>But I would not charge this sin of idleness
only upon the female sex: many men have been
more shamefully guilty, especially those who
have mispent so much time in gaming, (not to
speak of excess in eating and drinking, and other
time-consuming sins which are reproved in their
proper place) O the time that many have spent
in gaming! Some recreations wherein the body
is exercised, may be lawful and necessary at some
time; so they do not steal away too much of
their time and affections; but for men to sit at
games as hard as schollars at their books, what
rational plea can be used for such wicked idle|ness?
Thus silver, and gold, and great estates
have been consumed; and O the golden hours,
the dayes, and nights, and precious time, that
have been lost in gaming! Thus some have run
out of all, and removed into the Country to hide
their shame, after their high port in the City;
some have gone into the high wayes, not to beg,
but to do that which is far worse, which in some
hath had a dreadful conclusion. And not only
this kind of Idleness hath brought poverty, but
also that heedless, slothful spirit, which many of
the City have had in their callings; which hath
made them blemishes to the City, and hath been
an helper on of our ruine.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="72">
13. <HI>A thirteenth sin of</HI> London <HI>is unmerciful|ness,</HI>
another of <HI>Sodom</HI>'s sins. <HI>Ezek. 16. 49. She
strengthened not the hands of the poor and needy.</HI>
I shall not blame the whole for this sin, for the
charity of <HI>London</HI> hath sounded throughout the
land, and throughout the world. But yet have
not many of the great men of the City been
guilty of unmercifulness, who though more
able, yet have been less forward to contribute
to the relief of such as have been in distress? It
hath been the comfort of some who have lost
much by the fire, that they had saved what be|fore
they had given to the poor, by putting it out
of the reach of moth, or rust, or thieves, or
flames of fire. But oh what marble bowels have
some had towards the poor! so that they could,
(whatever abundance they had by them beyond
what themselves did make use of) as freely part
with so many drops of their blood, as pieces of
money, though to help some of the needy and
distressed members of Jesus Christ: not consi|dering
that the Lord Jesus is the Heir of all
things, and whatever estate they had, they were
but his stewards; and that relief of the needy is
a debt, which though man cannot require it of
them, yet God can: and is it unequal if for want
of payment of Gods debts (which they owed out
of their estates, by vertue of Gods command, to
the poor) the Lord hath dispossest them of
his houses, and burnt them with fire, and taken
away part of the estates which he gave them
because they have employed them no more for
his glory.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="72">
14. <HI>A fourteenth sin of</HI> London <HI>is Vncleanness,</HI>
another sin of <HI>Sodom;</HI> their sin indeed was unna|tural
uncleanness. I would hope that this sin
hath been little known and practised in the
City. But Fornication and Adultery have been
too common. Indeed there hath not been that
boldness and impudency in this sin as elsewhere;
there hath not been that whores forehead so ge|nerally
in <HI>London,</HI> and declaring the iniquity
like <HI>Sodom:</HI> but let the consciences of many
Londoners speak, whether they have not been
secretly guilty of this sin? Would it not be a
shame to tell of the chambering and wanton|ness,
and privy leudness which hath been com|mitted
in <HI>London?</HI> suppose that in all the remain|ing
Churches the sin of uncleanness should be
reproved; and all, both men and women that
have been actually guilty of it, should be forced
by an inward sting of conscience (as sometimes
those were upon the words of our Saviour that
accused the woman taken in Adultery) immedi|ately
to go forth out of the place: what a stir
would there be in some Churches? what an
emptying of some Pews? what a clearing of
some Iles? and how few would there be remain|ing
in some places?</P>
<P>Suppose a visible mark were put by God up|on
the foreheads of all Adulterers in the City of
<HI>London,</HI> as God put a mark upon <HI>Cain</HI> after he
had been guilty of murther; would not many
who walk now very demurely, and with much
seeming innocency, walk with blushes in their
<PB N="160" REF="73">
cheeks? would not many keep house and hide
their face, and not stir abroad except in the
night? or if in the day, would they not shuf|fle
thorow the streets, and hate the fashion of
little hats, and the court-mode of wearing them
behind their head; and rather get such whose
brims are of a larger size, which might the more
conveniently cover their brows? And would
not many unsuspected and seemingly modest
women also, stain their cheeks with a vermilion
dye upon their husbands or friends search into
their countenance? would not many of them
walk with thick hoods, and wear continually
deep fore-head-cloaths, as if they were troubled
with a perpetual head-ake, that they might
hide their shame from the view of man?</P>
<P>This sin is so nasty and filthy, that whate|ver
swinish pleasure is found in the commission
of it, usually those that are guilty (unless the
brow be brass) are ashamed that it should be
known: the holy and jealous eye of God hath
seen them in their filthiness; their secret sins are
set in the light of his countenance, which above
all should make them ashamed; <HI>Whoremongers
and Adulterers God will judge,</HI> Heb. 13. 4. which
should make them afraid.</P>
<P>I have heard of <HI>Smithfield</HI> haunts, and <HI>Moore|field</HI>
walks, whither there hath been too great a
resort from the City under the shadow of the
wings of the night, about these deeds of darkness;
the words and signs which such lewd persons
have used to signifie their minds one to ano|ther
I am unacquainted withall: the many
Whorehouses, under the name of Alehouses
<PB N="161" REF="73">
about <HI>London,</HI> by report have had too many
customers: and if the Constables had been as
zealous at other times, as they were when the
strict Press was in the City to disturb those Con|venticles,
they might possibly have found more
of that Coat, and Tribe who should have given
better example.</P>
<P>If there have not been publick Stews in <HI>Lon|don</HI>
as in other Cities in the World; yet have not
some made their own houses little better, some
men bringing in their whores in little better
than publick view? and of the other Sex some
by the open weare of naked breasts, and their
light attyre and carriage, have enticed the eye
and courtship, and after, basely prostituted their
bodies to the lusts of filthy Ruffians. O the
boyling, burning lusts that have been in <HI>London!</HI>
O the wanton eyes and looks! the speculative
uncleanness, and secret self-pollutions! the ob|scene
and filthy speeches! the toying and lustful
dalliances! and the gross actual uncleann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ss
which God hath been witness to every day in
<HI>London!</HI> This sin of uncleanness doth debase the
spirit made at first after Gods own image; de|files
both soul and body, which should be the
Temple of the Holy-Ghost; and renders men
unfit for communion with an holy God, who is
of such pure eyes that he cannot approve of the
least iniquity; much less of this, which is so
gross; and not only so but doth exceedingly
provoke him unto anger and jealousie.</P>
<P>This may be one sin that hath brought down
such fearful judgements upon the City; we read
of twenty and four thousand men that fell in
<PB N="162" REF="74">
one day by the Plague, for the sin of fornicati|on,
<HI>Num.</HI> 15. 9. and have not many thousand
inhabitants and habitations of <HI>London</HI> fallen for
this sin? It is said of the Israelites, <HI>Hos. 7. 6. they
have made ready their heart like an Oven, while
they lye in wait, their Baker sleepeth all night; in
the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</HI> Have
not the hearts of many in <HI>London</HI> been like an
Oven for lust, and themselves like Bakers putting
fewel into it, and stirring it up; and if whilest
they have lain in wait, and have not had pre|sent
opportunity for satisfaction of their lusts;
they have seemed to be asleep; yet no sooner
hath the Morning light of a fit occasion offered
it self to their adulterous eyes, but their adulte|rous
hearts have burned within them, and
broken forth into a flaming fire, in the actual
commission of the sin.</P>
<P>And hath this been the practice only of the
Court, and of <HI>Westminster</HI> side? hath not the
cursed Leaven of this common sin of the times,
spread it self also in the City? Therefore the
Lord also hath made ready his wrath as in an
hot Oven; and though like a Baker he hath
seemed to sleep while he lay in wait, and de|layd
to execute his judgments; yet in the
Morning of his great provocation by this and
other sins, his anger hath broke forth like a
flaming fire, from whence that fire hath been
kindled which hath burnt the greatest part of
<HI>London</HI> down to the ground, <HI>Ier.</HI> 5. 8, 9. When
the Israelites were like <HI>fed horses in the morning,
every one neighing after his neighbours Wife;</HI> The
Lord speaks to them in his wrath, <HI>Shall not I
<PB N="163" REF="74">
visit for these things? shall not my soul be avenged
on such a Nation as this?</HI></P>
<P>15. <HI>A fifteenth sin of</HI> London <HI>is Drunkenness;</HI>
This sin hath been more visible and apparent; I
believe that scarcely any Nation under Heaven
hath proportionably more Taverns and Ale|houses
than <HI>England,</HI> and no place in <HI>England</HI> so
many as <HI>London,</HI> and its adjacent parts: and of
all the many thousands of these houses I believe
there hath been scarce any but could give many
instances of this sin. Besides the many private
houses where this sin hath been practised. How
have men <HI>risen early in the morning to follow strong
drink, and continued unto night, till wine inflamed
them?</HI> Isa. 5. 11. <HI>Come ye say they, and I will
fetch wine, and we will fill our selves with strong
drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and
much more abundant,</HI> Isa. 56. 12. The corners
and beds full of vomit, the reelings about the
streets, the <HI>contentions</HI> and wranglings, <HI>the wounds
without cause, the redness of the eyes,</HI> and such
like have been to evident a demonstration, of
mens <HI>tarrying too long at the Wine,</HI> and distem|pering
themselves with excessive drinking, <HI>Prov.</HI>
23. 29, 30. To be overtaken with drunken|ness
is a great sin, which makes men more brui|tish
than their very Horses, who will not ex|ceed
their measure in drinking, except they be
forced to it by Barnacles: and if none in the
City had yielded to receive the drench of a cup
beyond the measure without Barnacles upon
their noses, I suppose that with their horses, they
<PB N="164" REF="75">
would have been more sober; and hereby pre|vented
many distempers of body, and worse
distempers of mind, and which is worst of all,
much dishonour of God, as well as of themselves,
which excess in this kind hath been the cause
of. But for men to follow after this sin, and
make it their trade and common practice; to
delight in it, and seek for their God and chief
happiness, in a cup of Wine, or Ale, and to grow
men of might in drinking; to exceed the bounds
by many degrees without reeling, to entice others
to it, yea to force them to drink healths (that
ungodly practice) which would not in the least
promote anothers health, but was likely to de|stroy
their own, through the excess which such
practices do introduce; to take pleasure in drink|ing
down others under their feet; and after to
glory in their shame and wickedness; this is a
sin that doth so far exceed bruitish, that it be|comes
devilish, and doth highly provoke the Lord
to pour forth his fury like water upon the places
where such sins are committed.</P>
<P>And hath not <HI>London</HI> been guilty of this sin
of drunkenness with the aggravations of it?
Have not some of <HI>Londons</HI> Magistrates been
guilty, who should have punished this sin, and
too many Ministers, who should have reproved
it both by word and example of sobriety? And
for such to be seen drunk and reeling in the streets,
was very shamefull, and a great provocation.
Have not the late judgements in some sort point|ed
out this sin? the dizziness of head, and reel|ing
of persons that have been smitten with the
Plague; the flaming of the heart of the City,
<PB N="165" REF="75">
and reeling of the houses, and tumbling of them
to the ground by the fire, methinks were a re|proof
of the dizziness and reelings, about the streets
and houses, of such persons as had inflamed and
distempered themselves with excessive drinking.</P>
<P>16. <HI>A sixteenth sin of</HI> London <HI>is perverting of
judgement.</HI> This is a God-provoking sin: <HI>when
none calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth;
when men make to themselves crooked paths, and
there is no judgement in their goings; yea when
judgment is turned away backward, and justice
standeth afarr off, and truth is fallen in the streets,
and equity cannot enter; when truth faileth, and
he that departeth from evil, maketh himself a prey,</HI>
&amp;c. as the Prophet speaks, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59. When Magi|gistrates
are <HI>lovers of gifts, and followers after re|wards;
when they judge not the fatherless, neither
doth the cause of the widdow come unto them;</HI> then
the Lord cryeth <HI>Ah! I will ease me of mine
adversaries, and aveuge me of mine enemies,</HI>
Isaiah 1. 23, 24. I cannot charge <HI>London</HI>
deeply with this sin; not having been my self
present much in their Courts of Judicature;
and I would hope that justice hath taken place
here, as much as in most Cities in the world:
but when I read what the Lord saith concerning
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> Jer. 5. 1. <HI>Run ye too and fro through
the streets of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and see now and know,
and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find
a man, if there be any that executeth judgement,
that seeketh the truth, and I will pardon it:</HI> and
when withall I consider the dreadfull judgments
<PB N="166" REF="76">
of God upon the City of <HI>London,</HI> whereby the
glory of the Magistracy and government of the
City is so much stained; I would submit it to
enquiry whether there hath not been a failure
and perverting of judgment in the City? whe|ther
bribes and rewards have not blinded the
eyes, and the edge of the Law hath not been
turned against well doers, instead of evil doers?
whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">her the Fatherless and the Widdow have not
been sent weeping to their heavenly Father to
complain of injustice? It is not a time to cover
faults but to confess and leave them; least una|voidable
ruine come upon us when it will be
too late.</P>
<P>17. <HI>A seventeenth sin of</HI> London <HI>is Covetous|ness.</HI>
How universally hath this sin reigned in
the City? so that it may almost be said of <HI>London,</HI>
as it was of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> Jer. 6. 13. <HI>From the least
of them even unto the greatest of them every one is
given to covetousness.</HI> Those who have been free
from gluttony, drunkenness, adultery, and the
like expensive sins; have on the other hand ad|dicted
themselves to the sin of covetousness. I
do not charge all, but oh how almost universal
hath this sin among tradesmen been? which
hath evidenced it self both in their getting and
keeping riches.</P>
<P>1. In <HI>getting:</HI> what eager desires after the
world, and their obtaining an estate by their
trades? What studies and consultations, what
wracking the brains, and torturing the wits, to
find out the best way of thriving in the world?
<PB N="167" REF="76">
what earnest prosecutions have there been, and la|borious
endeavours, rising up early, and sitting
up late, and wearying the body, and the mind all
the day, eating the bread of carefulness, and
mingling the drink with sollicitousness, crouding
up the whole time with worldly business, so that
their own health hath been disregarded, as well
as the worship of God neglected in the families
of these worldlings; and all to scrape a little
worldly riches together which some have mist of,
notwithstanding all their endeavours: and if
they have obtained, yet they have remained more
poor in contentment, than when they were more
poor in their estates? for as their estates have
increased, so their desires have increased and been
farther off from satisfaction; as they have en|larged
their shops and trades; and wealth hath
flowed in upon them; so they have enlarged
their desires like Hell, and like the Grave have
never said It is enough: when they have added
bag to bag, and house to house, the more cares,
and fears, and sometimes piercing sorrows have
accompanied their gains; but far have they been
from finding the contentment and comfort in
their riches that they looked for.</P>
<P>2. This covetousness hath appeared in <HI>keeping</HI>
what they have gotten: keeping I say, for cove|tous
persons have had little heart to spend though
in necessary uses what they have scraped toge|ther:
they have had wealth, but the use of it
they have not had; it hath been to them like a
treasure in a chest of which they had lost the
key; or like another mans money in their
keeping, which they must not meddle withall.
<PB N="168" REF="77">
Whatever abundance they have had in the bag,
and in the coffer, their families have been in
want; the table hath been penurious; the back
and belly have been pinched; they have lived at
a meaner rate than those that have been of a
meaner degree. The poor might starve at their
doors, no pitty towards others in want and mi|sery,
and the least pitty towards themselves:
whilest they have saved, for fear least afterwards
they should want; they have all along wanted,
whilest they have been saving; and it may be
at last they have lost what they have been keep|ing,
to the unexpressible grief, and it may be
breaking of their hearts, which have been so set
upon these things.</P>
<P>This sin of covetousness in some hath had
deeper rooting, in most hath had too much foot|ing:
and in all hath been very heinous and abo|minable
before God. This sin is termed Ido|latry
in Scripture, and the covetous are stigma|tized
with the name of Idolaters, <HI>Col. 3. 5.
Ephes.</HI> 5. 5. It is heart idolatry forbidden in the
first commandment. That thing we make a
God to our selves, which we chiefly affect: if
it be the world, then we make the world our
God; which is inconsistent with the true love
of God the Father the only true God. 1 Joh.
2. 15. <HI>Love not the world, neither the things that
are in the world, if any man love the world, the
love of the father is not in him.</HI> This sin of co|vetousness
is hateful to God and provokes his
wrath, Isa. 57. 17. <HI>for the iniquity of his cove|tousness
was I wroth and smote him.</HI> Hath not
God smitten <HI>London</HI> with the plague and fire,
<PB N="169" REF="77">
among other iniquities, for this iniquity of Co|vetousness?
When <HI>London</HI> was eagerly pursuing
after the World, and all minding and seeking
their own Interest, without any regard to the
Interest of Gods glory and Kingdom, or care
of their soul-interest and salvation, which their
worldly business would not allow time for; did
not the Lord send a Plague to put a stop to their
Trade; and gave them time to seek him, and
to make their peace with him in their retire|ments,
which they could not, or rather would
not finde before? And when they returned with
more eagerness to their Trades, after the Plague
was a little over, that they might fetch up if
they could what they had miss'd by that inter|mission;
did not the Lord send a Fire to consume
much of that which they had set their hearts
upon, and in large legible Letters write <HI>Vanity</HI>
upon this Idol, which so many had worshipped?
Let <HI>London</HI> consider and lay to heart this sin of
Covetousness.</P>
<P>18. <HI>The Eighteenth sin of</HI> London <HI>is Extortion;</HI>
thus Covetousness hath expressed it self more
grosly in some. I shall not here discourse con|cerning
Usury; but the extorting Use, which
some have taken of those who have been in want;
the taking Use upon Use, and grinding the faces
of the Poor in their distress, no doubt is a great
sin, and very offensive to God. How many
Extortioners have there been in <HI>London,</HI> who
have enriched themselves by impoverishing of
others; who panting after the dust of the Earth,
<PB N="170" REF="78">
on the head of the Poor, have lent Money to
them, not for their help, but to catch them at
an advantage, that so without mercy they might
catch away all that they had, not leaving them
so much as a Bed to ly on? Thus some have
been like <HI>Lyons</HI> for Cruelty, and like <HI>Evening
Wolves</HI> unt the poor, <HI>tearing their flesh from
their bones, and reserving their very bones to gnaw
in the morning,</HI> as the Prophet speaks, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3. 3.
This sin of Extortion was one of the abomina|tions
reckoned up by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> for
which God was so highly offended with <HI>Ieru|salem,</HI>
chap. 22. 12. <HI>Thou hast taken Vsury and in|crease,
and hast greedily gained of thy Neighbour by
Extortion; and hast forgotten me;</HI> for this and
other sins there mentioned, it is said <HI>v. 3. There|fore
have I poured out my indignation upon them;
I have consumed them with the fire of my Wrath.</HI>
Unto this sin of Extortion I may add severall
other wayes that many in the City have had of
getting Estates, which some may dispute for
the lawfulness of, and because so common and
gainfull, the sin is little heeded; but when the
Lord hath been contending with the whole City,
and hath inflicted a generall stroke upon Trades|men,
yea one stroke upon another, and hath
trodden their Trade under his feet, as seeming
to be offended with something therein; me|thinks
they should be awakened, and open their
eyes, and impartially search, and labour to finde
out whatever it is that doth offend him, what|ever
seeming disadvantage may come to them
thereby. And if they will not hearken, God can
take away the remainder, as he hath done a
<PB N="171" REF="78">
great part, and so force them to a sense of their
sin.</P>
<P>One sinfull way of getting Estates, and I am
perswaded displeasing to God, is <HI>engrossing and
monopolizing of Commodities,</HI> which many in <HI>Lon|don</HI>
have done, that having all the Commodities
of that kinde in their hands, they might make
their own Market, and set their own price upon
them; which if they sold as cheap as other|wise
they would do, or as others do when they
are shared into many hands (as possibly some
may) I could not condemn the thing: But when
by getting the whole into their hands, they hoist
and raise the Price far beyond the just Value,
which they necessitate people to give, and that
only that they might enrich themselves: this I
dare confidently affirm to be unlawfull; and
my reason is, because hereby they prefer a lesser
good, before a greater; namely, the enriching
of themselves, and their Families, before the
more publick good of making the Commodity
more cheap to the Commonwealth. If they
say, the injury which they who buy of it, will
sustain, (they being so many) will be very small
and inconsiderable; but the good they shall get
hereby will be great, and they may be in a better
capacity of doing good; I answer, that none
ought to do the <HI>least injury</HI> for the reaping of the
<HI>greatest advantage;</HI> It being absolutely unlawfull
<HI>to do evil, that good may come thereby, and the
damnation of such will be just,</HI> Rom. 3. 8. and
consequently a greater injury will come to them|selves,
than to those whom they injure; yea, the
Injury will be greater, than the Good, which
<PB N="172" REF="79">
they obtain. And as for their being in a capacity
of doing more good; I believe that such persons,
if they do spend such gains, are more forward
to spend them on their lusts, than to lay them
out in Charitable uses; I have not heard
that the greatest Monopolizers in <HI>London</HI> have
been the most charitable persons.</P>
<P>If I were more acquainted with the mysteries
of Trades in the City, I fear, I might finde out
more than one Mystery of Iniquity among them.
If the Lord would put into the hearts of Ma|gistrates
and Citizens, to look into Trades, and
to consider the equity that they bear, and take
some course for rectifying abuses in them; it
might be one way to obtain a more favourable
aspect from Heaven; and the Lord might revive
again the Trade of <HI>London,</HI> which now is dying
and sinking to the ground.</P>
<P>19. <HI>A Nineteenth sin of</HI> London <HI>is Lying.</HI> It
is said of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> Nah. 3. 1. that it was <HI>a City
full of lies.</HI> O the Lies that have been in <HI>Lon|don!</HI>
who can reckon them? Lies in the streets,
<HI>loud lies,</HI> which have been cryed, false News
which we daily hear. Lies in the Chambers,
<HI>secret lies,</HI> privy false tales which are whispered
in the ears: Lies in the Shop, <HI>trading lies;</HI> lies
told in buying and selling: <HI>Officious lies,</HI> which
some tell to do their friends a kindness: <HI>Mischie|vous
lies,</HI> which some tell to do another an in|jury.
We read of some, <HI>that bend their tongue
like their bow for lies, that will not speak the truth,
but teach their tongue to speak lies,</HI> Jer, 9. 3, 5.
<PB N="173" REF="79">
How many Liars have there been in <HI>London?</HI>
What age is free from this sin? The Children
have learned to lie, as soon as they have learned
to speak. What house hath been free? How have
Tradesmen been guilty of lying, which some ac|count
a necessary adjunct to their Trade, with|out
which they could not live? How many Ser|vants
have excused one another and themselves
when they have committed faults, with their
lies? But of all lies, mischievous lies have been the
worst, which some have invented to do an inju|ry
to their neighbour; such lies are more im|mediately
begotten by the Devil the Father of
lies, and such liars are his most genuine Off|spring.
But all lies in a sense are mischievous
lies; they are mischievous to the party that tells
them; even the Officious liar cannot do so much
kindness to his Friend by his lye, as he doth inju|ry
to himself: What! will a man stab himself to
do his Friend a courtesie? he that wounds his
Conscience doth worse; he that gains in his
Trade by his lye, loseth more than he gains: A
bag of Gold is not to be compared with inward
peace, and the favour of God (better than life)
which by this sin is lost. Surely, the Lord, being
a God of Truth, is much offended with this sin
of lying. <HI>God delights,</HI> saith <HI>Solomon, in them
that deal truly, but lying lips are an abomination
to him,</HI> Prov. 12. 22. Lying was one sin of <HI>Is|rael,</HI>
for which <HI>their land did mourn,</HI> Hos. 14.
2, 3. And God threatneth to give <HI>all liars their
part in that lake which burneth with fire and brim|stone,</HI>
Rev. 21. 8. Methinks that one place should
make all liars to tremble. And is not this one
<PB N="174" REF="80">
sin which some Professors also in the City have
been guilty of, to the shame of their Profession;
for which the Lord hath sent the Fire to burn
down the City, to awaken us to fly from this
sin, as we would escape the future Fire of
Hell?</P>
<P>20. <HI>Another sin of</HI> London <HI>is couzening and de|frauding:</HI>
This sin hath been the product of
Covetousness, and the companion of Lying, and
how ordinary hath it been among Tradesmen,
which many have been so accustomed to, that it
hath been as easie to perswade the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> to
change his skin, as to perswade them to leave
off their Couzening? This they have lookt upon
as even essential to their Trade, at least as ne|cessary
to their Gains; yea some have pleaded
a necessity thereof, to get a Livelyhood for them|selves
and Families. But there is no necessity of
any sin; Duties are necessary, but sins are never
necessary, and the gain which is gotten by sin,
is like the gain of a Garment, which hath the
Plague in it, which if it bring warmth for the
present, quickly also may bring sickness and
death: and if Couzening brings gain into the
<HI>purse,</HI> it presently brings the Plague into the <HI>heart,</HI>
and quickly will bring the pain and punishment
of Hell.</P>
<P>To defraud another in dealing, is but a more
covert way of stealing, and it is as lawfull to
take a Purse upon the High-way, as to take a
Shilling by fraud in the Shop; the difference
lies only in the degree, the nature of the sin
<PB N="175" REF="80">
which is Theft, is the same in both. And the
Lord, as he hath expresly forbidden this sin, so
he hath threatned to avenge it, 1 <HI>Thess. 4. 6. That
no man go beyond or defraud his Brother</HI> (not only
in a greater thing but) <HI>in any matter, because the
Lord is the avenger of all such.</HI> The several ways
which Tradesmen have had of defrauding, would
be too large for me to speak of, neither am I
so skilfull as to understand. The falsifying of
Weights and Measures is gross, a sin practised
among the <HI>Iews</HI> of old, which God threatens
to punish them for, <HI>Hos. 12. 7. Ephraim is a mer|chant,
the ballances of deceit are in his hand.</HI> And
both their sin and Gods anger are set forth, <HI>Mic.
6. 10, 11, 12, 13. Are there yet the treasures of
wickedness in the houses of the wicked, and the scant
measure which is abominable? shall I count them
pure with the wicked ballances, and with the bag
of deceitfull weights? For the rich men thereof are
full of violence, and the Inhabitants thereof have spo|ken
lyes, and their tongue is deceitfull in their mouth:
Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee,
in making thee desolate, because of thy sins.</HI> And
was it not thus with <HI>London?</HI> Did they not
falsifie Weights and Measures, and falsifie Com|modities,
and speak falsly concerning the price
of them, and take unconscionable gains, and yet
profess kinde usage of their Customers, whom
they did most exact upon? But if I could, I
should not open the cunning wayes which some
have found out, of defrauding and over-reach|ing,
least any should learn, and be enticed to
practise the sin by the very reproof of it, as I have
heard some have done.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="81">
Now such persons, who have gotten their
wealth by defrauding and over-reaching their
brethren, bring themselves into such a snare of the
Devil, that very few ever get out, but are dragg'd
by him thereby into hell; because it is not bare
grieving for this sin, which is necessary to the
obtaining of a pardon; but restitution is neces|sary;
they must refund, they must restore, either
to the parties themselves, or to the poor, what
they have gotten wrongfully, if they be able;
if not, as much as they have, otherwise they can|not
be saved. No salvation came to <HI>Zacheus</HI> till
he was resolved upon restitution of what he had
wrongfully gained, <HI>Luke 19. 8, 9. God smites his
hand at dishonest gain,</HI> Ezek. 21. 13. and this is
one sin which I believe God hath smitten <HI>London</HI>
for.</P>
<P>21. <HI>The one and twentyeth sin of</HI> London <HI>is
Prodigality and Profuse spending;</HI> Some have
spared too much through covetousness, others
have spent too much through prodigality. Li|berality
is a great vertue; and bountiful cha|rity
an excellent grace, which <HI>London</HI> hath not
been without; but prodigality is a great sin.
Thus some have spent above their degree, lavish|ing
out their Estates on their tables, on their
houses, on their cloathes; but the worst prodi|gality
hath been, in that which men have la|vished
out in the satisfaction of their lusts, in
drunkenness, gaming, whoring, and the like; and
especially those, who have spent profusely that
which hath been none of their own, but what
<PB N="177" REF="81">
they have taken up on credit of others; have
been most grosly guilty of this sin.</P>
<P>And unto this sin of prodigality and profuse|ness,
I may refer the sin of <HI>excessive mirth and
jollity,</HI> which hath been in <HI>London,</HI> there is an
harmless mirth which is lawfull; and there is
a spiritual chearfulness, which is the duty of
Christians: though in times of great sin and af|fliction
of Gods people, sackcloth and mourning
doth become Christians, and some expressions of
joy which are more carnal, should be much for|born:
But I am speaking of the mirth of such,
who have had the least ground for mirth of any,
namely the wicked, unto whom no peace nor
joy in that estate doth belong: for Them to
be so excessively merry and Jovial, and frolick,
expressing it in their prophane, obscene, and
scurrilous jesting; in their musick, singing, and
dancing; in their ranting, roaring, and carous|ing;
in many wastfull and profuse wayes of
spending; when the Church is in sackcloth, and
lies a bleeding; as too many in <HI>London</HI> have
done; surely God hath been offended with this,
and hath been provoked to send down his judge|ments,
to alter the cheer of <HI>London,</HI> and hereby
to put them into mourning, which they were so
averse unto.</P>
<P>Had they foreseen the Plague, and how many
of them should have fallen by it, surely it would
have damped their mirth; had they foreseen the
burning of the City of <HI>London;</HI> and that their
houses should have fallen by the fire; surely their
laughter would have been turned into heaviness.
These judgements they could not foresee; but
<PB N="178" REF="82">
future Judgment far more dreadful, they might
have foreseen, which should have made an im|pression
of sorrow upon them if possibly by re|pentance
they might avoid and escape it. <HI>Be
afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter be
turned into mourning, and your joy into heaviness,</HI>
Jam. 4. 9. Such mourning if for sin might be a
means to prevent future miseries, and eternal
woe and weeping; others they have reason to
mourn for those miseries which will come upon
them. <HI>Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl,
for the miseries that shall come upon you,</HI> Jam.
5. 1. but for prophane wicked persons to sing,
and rejoyce just upon the brink of the grave and
hell, is very unreasonable and an aggravation of
their other sins.</P>
<P>22. <HI>The twenty second sin of</HI> London <HI>is envy|ing.</HI>
And this sin was to be found not only in
Women, which envied others that exceeded
them, in beauty of body, in cloaths, and dressing,
and such like toyes; but also in men, who en|vied
them who were of the same trade, which
had better houses and shops, more custome and
wealth than themselves, as <HI>Hesiod</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign">:</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign">.</L></Q></P>
<P>Yea this envying was to be found among many
Ministers, who envied others that had better
parts, and more learning, greater applause, and
more auditors than themselves. There was a
<PB N="179" REF="82">
<HI>spirit among us which lusted to envy,</HI> Jam. 4. 5.
which besides the great torment that it brings
to the spirit where it reigns, is a very great pro|vocation
to the Lord.</P>
<P>23. <HI>The twenty third sin of</HI> London <HI>is slandering
and backbiting,</HI> which hath been the consequent
of the former. The ninth commandment hath
been exceedingly broken in <HI>London,</HI> especially
in a private way of bearing false witness against
the neighbour, and wounding his reputation by
a slanderous tongue: some inventing lyes, and
raising slanders, which they have in their con|sciences
known to be false; others taking up
slanders, readily believing them without any
just proof. This sin you have set forth with a
caution to take heed of such persons, <HI>Ier.</HI> 9.
4, 5. <HI>London</HI> hath been full of backbiters and
tale-bearers, and too many professours have been
guilty of this sin: few have entertained back|biters
with an angry countenance, which as the
wind driveth away rain, would have driven
them out of sight. I might here add the hatred
of one another that hath been in <HI>London</HI> (much
through slanders) the emulation that hath risen
from hatred; the wrath that hath risen from
emulation; and the wrath of God which hath
arisen from these and other works of the flesh,
spoken of, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 19, 20.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="83">
24. <HI>The twentyfourth sin of</HI> London <HI>is murmur|ing:</HI>
and that not only in want, and under losses
and crosses but also in fulness and plenty. Ma|ny
Farmers in the Countrey have murmured at
the plenty and cheapness of Corn; many trades|men
in the City have murmured at the plenty of
the commodities which they have dealt in;
because however such plenty is a publick and
unspeakable mercy, yet they have had the less
private advantage which hath been chiefly re|garded
by them. Yea some in their murmur|ing
have wished for a Plague, that the survivers
might have the better trade; And I have heard
that a Fire also hath been wisht for, to take
off the plenty of such commodities, that
the remainder might bear the higher rate.
Is it a wonder then if God have sent Plague and
Fire which some have called for by such mur|muring
speeches? The <HI>Israelites</HI> in the Wilderness
were plagued for their murmuring; and the
murmuring company of <HI>Corah,</HI> that were not
swallowed up with him were consumed by a fire
from Heaven.</P>
<P>25. <HI>The twenty fifth and last sin of</HI> London,
<HI>which I shall speak of, is Carnal security;</HI> ano|ther
of <HI>Sodoms</HI> sins. It is said of the Sodomites,
Luk. 17. 28, 29. <HI>In the days of</HI> Lot, <HI>they did eat,
they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted,
they builded: But the same day that</HI> Lot <HI>went
out of</HI> Sodom, <HI>it rained fire and brimstone from
<PB N="181" REF="83">
Heaven, and destroyed them all.</HI> When <HI>London</HI> had
provoked God so highly by so many sins, yet
how secure were they before his judgements
broke forth upon them, they eat and drank, they
bought and sold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They sate at ease, and put
far from them the evil day, as <HI>Amos</HI> 6. they were
still, and at rest, little expecting such changes as
have come upon them, and taking little care to
prevent them: they were secure and trusted in arms
of flesh, broken reeds which have alwayes failed.
And I might add here as a cause of the security
of some, the presumptuous confidences of future
events which belong only to God to foreknow;
which some have taken upon them so absolutely
to determine as if they had looked into the book
of Gods decrees, or had an infallible revelation
from him of what should come to pass. O the
good dayes that some have looked for upon the
presumption of what they had no ground for&punc;
Great expectations many had of the Fall of <HI>An|tichrist</HI>
and <HI>Babylon</HI> in the year 1666. and other
events, limiting times, which God hath not clear|ly
revealed, which is an entrenching upon Gods
prerogative, and I believe a greater provocation
than such persons are aware of. This may be
one reason why <HI>London</HI> is fallen instead of <HI>Baby|lon,</HI>
in this year of such expectation and pre|sumption.</P>
<P>By this time it may be the Reader may be
wearied with reading, as I am with thinking
and writing of <HI>Londons</HI> sins. But how hath the
Lord been wearied with the bearing of them,
how hath he been pressed with the weight of
them, as a Cart is pressed that is full of Sheaves?
<PB N="182" REF="84">
<HI>Amos</HI> 2. 13. If when you have read of <HI>Lon|dons</HI>
judgements, withall you consider <HI>Londons</HI>
provocations, you must needs acknowledge that
God is righteous in that he hath punished <HI>Lon|don</HI>
no more than they have deserved for these
sins.</P>
<P>2. GOds <HI>Righteousness</HI> will further appear, if
we consider that <HI>he hath punished</HI> Lon|don
<HI>less than her iniquities deserved.</HI></P>
<P>1. God might have punished <HI>London</HI> deserv|edly
with more dreadful judgements here; and
that both in the same and another kind.</P>
<P>1. God might have deservedly punished <HI>London</HI>
worse in the same kind,</P>
<P>1. In the judgement of the <HI>Plague;</HI> It was
a dreadful Plague indeed; but God could have
made it more dreadful; where he shot one ar|row,
he might have shot an hundred: he visited
many families; he might have visited every fa|mily;
and swept every house with the beesome
of destruction. Though so many fell, yet I be|lieve
that five parts in six of the inhabitants of
<HI>London</HI> were preserved; God might have taken
away the five parts, and have left but one alive:
yea it might have been said of <HI>London,</HI> as it was
of <HI>Israel,</HI> Amos 5. 2, 3. <HI>The Virgin of Israel is
fallen, she shall rise no more; the City that went
out by a thousand shall leave an hundred.</HI> God
might have made every hundred that dyed by
the Plague, a thousand; he might have sent out
his arrows after all the inhabitants of <HI>London,</HI>
that were gone into the Countrey; and smitten
<PB N="183" REF="84">
them wheresoever he found them: or he might
have met with them upon their return home,
and given commission to Death to lay hold on
them assoon as they entred into their doors. He
might have depopulated the City of <HI>London</HI> by
the Plague; so that every house should have
had dead Corpses lying, and none to bury them.
He might have made our Plague <HI>wonderful, fear|ful,</HI>
and of <HI>long continuance.</HI></P>
<P>We that have survived so great a mortality,
have reason to say, that deservedly it might
have been greater; that we deserved as much
or more to fall, for our more heinous sins, than
thousands that are gone down into the pitt, surely
<HI>it is of the Lords mercies that we are not consumed;</HI>
he was merciful in sparing of us; he would
have been righteous if he had destroyed us.</P>
<P>Think with your selves, you that are alive, and
remain escaped; how fearful would the Plague
have been, if it had come home to <HI>your</HI> houses;
you were afraid to hear of others houses visited
and shut up; what would you have been, if it
had entered <HI>your</HI> doors? you were afraid when
others were struck with the disease; what would
you have been, if you had been struck your
selves? <HI>Sinners,</HI> what would you have done if
the arrow had pierced through your Livers, if
under such guilt and wrath you had been smit|ten?
when you had such a Plague of sin in
your hearts, if you should have had the Plague
of Pestilence in your bodies; if when you were
so rotten and corrupt, and defiled inwardly,
you should have had boyls, and blanes, and run|ning
sores outwardly; if when conscience was
<PB N="184" REF="85">
so filled with guilt; your bodies should have been
filled with this disease; In a word; If when you
had the marks of Hell and damnation in your
souls, you should have had the marks of inevita|ble
death in your bodies; Oh the dread that
would have seised upon you! The Judgement
of the Plague might have been worse to you;
you might have spent above a year in Hell by
this time among Devils and damned Spirits;
you might by this time have been inured to
those torments which yet you could not have en|dured,
but must have endured for ever without
any possibility of deliverance for ever.</P>
<P>Many of you who have escaped, have your
Families unbroken, when other whole Families
are swept away. Suppose thy dear Wife had
fallen, or thy hopefull Children had been nipt
by death in the very bud, and your Families had
been maimed; the Judgement would have been
much sorer on you. None can say but God
might have righteously punished <HI>London</HI> more
severely by the Plague.</P>
<P>2. God might have punished <HI>London</HI> also
more severely by the <HI>Fire.</HI> The greatest part
of the City is fallen, it might have been the
whole: Most of the City within the Walls is
consumed; the flames might have issued forth
at all the Gates, and consumed all the Suburbs
too: all the goods might have been burnt with
the houses, and all the Inhabitants with the Ha|bitations.</P>
<P>The Fire, though it burned dreadfully, yet it
began at one end; and came on so slowly, that
most of the Inhabitants of <HI>London</HI> had time to
<PB N="185" REF="85">
remove themselves, and the choycest of their
goods; some Livelihood was left, and Materials
for a future Trade.</P>
<P>Suppose the Fire had been so sudden, or had
been kindled in so many places, that there had
been no possibility of removing any thing, ex|cept
the persons themselves. Suppose all the
Silver, and Gold, and rich Plate of the City had
been melted by this Fire, that all the Wares and
Merchandize, all the Garments, Beds and Hous|hold
goods had been turned into ashes; and ma|ny
thousand Families, that have been turned out
of house had been turned out of all, and quite
bereaved of all their Substance, so that nothing
had remained to them for necessary use, this
would have been very sore.</P>
<P>Alas! what would they have done? whether
would they have gone for relief? Would the
Court have supplyed them? Could the Coun|trey
have helped and maintained so many,
when so much impoverished themselves, that
in many places they are hardly able to live?
Could they have hoped for relief from foreign
Nations? Are not all the World almost our Ene|mies?
Is Charity so warm abroad? Alas! what
would they have done? Must not many of them
have pined away in their wants, and starved un|der
Hedges, for lack of suitable provisions. This
would have been dreadfull indeed.</P>
<P>Or suppose they had lugg'd their Goods out
of <HI>London</HI> from the Fire, and the whole City
had been burnt down with all the Suburbs, and
no habitations left standing hereabouts; what
would they have done with their goods? where
<PB N="186" REF="86">
would they have disposed of them? How could
they any wayes have continued their Trades?
Where could they have disposed of their persons?
How could they have lived this cold Winter
Season? Could they have struck up Booths pre|sently,
fit for themselves to abide in, which
would have sheltred them from the injury of the
weather? where would they have had materials,
when all was burnt?</P>
<P>Alas! what would they have done? must not
their goods have been spoyled by lying abroad?
would not they themselves, who had been used
to so much tenderness, have quickly grown sick,
and died in the Fields? would not thousands
have starved for cold? and what Provision could
they have had for food and other necessaries?
Besides; would they not have been a prey to
Theeves and Cut-throats? Would not many of
their Enemies, who laughed at the fall of the
City, have rejoyced much more, and taken ad|vantage
to come upon them in their nakedness,
and butcher'd them without mercy?</P>
<P>But, suppose the Fire that begun at one corner,
had been kindled in every Gate at the same time;
when all the Inhabitants had been asleep in their
Houses, and they had been inclosed with flames,
and no possibility of escape, how dreadfull would
the Fire have been then? If when they awakened
in the Morning they had seen the smoke ascend|ing
round about them, and the Fire drawing
neer to them; if both ends of a street had been
on Fire together, and they in the midst, and
had heard with the roaring of the Fire, a greater
roaring of the People that were burning with
<PB N="187" REF="86">
the Houses; O the ruefull looks! Oh the hor|rible
shrieks by women and children! oh the
dreadfull amazement and perplexity which
would have been in such a place and case! To
be burnt alive is dreadfull; but think what tor|tures
would have been in the spirits of guilty sin|ners,
who had not made their peace with God,
that had slept out the Harvest and day of Grace,
that had made no Provision for death and Eter|nity!
The noise and roaring without, would
have been nothing to the lashes and tearings
within them; the Fire in their Houses would
have been but small, in comparison of the fire in
their Consciences; and the flames of Hell-fire,
which if awakened, they would have seen just
before them.</P>
<P>This Judgement of the Fire might have been
more dreadfull than it was: Persons are esca|ped;
Goods and Wealth much saved; Houses
standing to receive them; Trade going on; God
might have punisht <HI>London</HI> more sorely in the
same kinde.</P>
<P>2. God might have punished <HI>London</HI> more se|verely
in other kindes of Judgements.</P>
<P>1. He might have brought upon them, and
upon the whole Land, the <HI>Sword</HI> of a Foreign
Enemy, as he did upon <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and the land
of <HI>Iudea,</HI> for their sins, which being so pathe|tically
set forth by the Prophet <HI>Ieremy, 4. v.</HI> 16.
to the end, I shall represent to the eye.</P>
<P>A Voice declareth from <HI>Dan,</HI> and publisheth af|fliction
from Mount <HI>Ephraim,</HI> make ye mention to
the Nations; behold, publish against <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
that Watchers come from a far Countrey, and give
<PB N="188" REF="87">
out their voice against the Cities of <HI>Judah:</HI> As
Keepers of the Field they are against her round about,
because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the
Lord. Thy way and thy doings have procured these
things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it
is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart. My
bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart,
my heart maketh a noise within me, I cannot hold
my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the
sound of the Trumpet, the Alarm of Warr. De|struction
upon destruction is cryed, for the whole land
is spoyled, and my curtains in a moment. How long
shall I see the Standard, and hear the sound of the
Trumpet; I beheld, and all the Cities were broken
down at the presence of the Lord, and by his fierce
anger; for thus hath the Lord said, The whole land
shall be desolate; for this shall the land mourn, and
the Heavens above be black. The whole City shall flee
for the noise of the Horsemen and the Bowmen, they
shall go into the Thickets, and climbe up upon the
Rocks; every City shall be forsaken, and not a man
dwell therein; And when thou art spoyled, what
wilt thou do? though thou cloathest thy self with
Crimson, though thou deckest thy self with Ornaments
of Gold, though thou rentest thy face with Paint|ing;
in vain shalt thou make thy self fair; thy
lovers shall despise thee, they will seek thy life: for
I have heard a voice, as of a woman in travell, and
the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first
childe; the voice of the daughter of Zion, that be|waileth
her self; that spreadeth forth her hands,
saying, Wo is me now, for my soul is wearied be|cause
of murtherers. <HI>This might have been the
Judgement, and these the Complaints of</HI> London
<PB N="189" REF="87">
<HI>and</HI> England; <HI>which would have been worse
than Plague or Fire. The Plague reached ma|ny,
but the Sword might have reached all; the
Fire devoured Houses, but the Sword might
have devoured the Inhabitants. The Lord might
have brought a Foreign Sword, and open Inva|sion;
or he might have given up</HI> London <HI>to a
more private sudden Butchery and</HI> Massacre <HI>by
the hands of cruel</HI> Papists, <HI>as was feared; which
would have been more dreadfull than the Massa|cre
of the Protestants by the Papists in</HI> Paris; <HI>be|cause
our numbers do so far exceed those which
were in that City.</HI></P>
<P>If bloody Papists had come into our Houses
in the dead of the Night, with such kinde of
Knives in their hands as were found after the
Fire in Barrels; and having set Watch at every
Streets end, had suffered none to escape, but
cruelly slaughtered the Husband with the Wife,
the Parents and the Children together, rip|ping
up women with Childe, and not sparing
either the Silver hair, or the Sucking Babe; If
there had been a cry at midnight, <HI>They are come;</HI>
but no possibility of flying from them, or making
resistance against them; if instead of heaps of
Stones and Bricks in the top of every street,
there had been heaps of dead Bodies, and the
Kennels had been made to run down with gore-blood;
sure this Judgement would have been
more dreadfull than the Plague or Fire, which
have been among us.</P>
<P>2. God might have punished <HI>London</HI> with
<HI>Famine,</HI> which is a greater Judgement than the
Plague or Sword: If the Lord had broken
<PB N="190" REF="88">
the whole staff of bread, and cut off all provi|sions
of food from the many thousand souls that
lived in and about the City; how dreadful
would this have been! If a famine had been so
sore in <HI>London;</HI> that people should have been
forced to eat one another and their own flesh,
as it was in <HI>Samaria</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> If instead
of houses in <HI>London,</HI> God should have made the
people as fuel of the Fire in this judgement, as
is threatned, Esa. 9. 19, 20. <HI>Through the wrath
of the Lord of Hosts is the Land darkened; and
the people shall be as the fuel of the fire, no man
shall spare his brother; and he shall snatch on his
right hand and be hungry; and he shall eat on
the left hand, and not be satisfied; they shall eat
every man the flesh of his own arms:</HI> If <HI>London</HI>
had been forced through hunger to eat the flesh
of their own arms, and the fruit of their own
bodies, Oh what a dismal face would there
have been in the City! and how would death
have been chosen rather than life; in the by-us-unconceivable
pain of gnawing hunger! Those
which <HI>dye</HI> by the Plague or are slain by the
sword, would be counted happy in comparison
with them that <HI>live</HI> under such a judgement.</P>
<P>Lastly, The righteousness of God in the judge|ments
he hath inflicted on <HI>London,</HI> appears; in
that he might instead of Plague and fire on earth
have punished them with the plagues and fire
of <HI>hell;</HI> which such sins as we have reckoned
up have abundantly deserved. <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon</HI>
now in Hell; <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> under the

<P>3. <HI>COncerning the design of these judgements. What
doth God mean by this terrible voice? by
speaking such terrible things in the City of</HI> London?
The Lord hath not only spoken but cryed and
shouted, he hath lifted up his voice like a Trum|pet;
and his voice hath not been inarticulate
and insignificant; but hath had a meaning;
and they that have an ear to hear, may under|stand;
for as the voice of the Lord hath cryed
in the City, so the voice of the Lord hath cryed
to the City, Mic. 6. 9. <HI>The Lords voice cryeth un|to
the City, The man of Wisdom shall see thy name,
hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</HI> Some
take notice of the judgements themselves, and
the effects of them upon themselves and fami|lies;
They discourse of the Plague, and how
many dyed thereby, that they have lost such a
relation, such a friend or neighbour was visited
and dyed quickly; They discourse of the Fire,
where it began, how it increased and prevailed,
<PB N="192" REF="89">
what day such a street fell, and where their
houses were consumed, what they lost, and how
much they saved: And it may be, some speak
of the hands of men, that were suspected to en|kindle
and carry it on; but few discourse of the
hand of God which sent both Plague and Fire,
and what he means by such strange and dread|ful
judgements: But the man of wisdom, such
as are wise do consider that these judgements
spring not out of the dust, but were sent down
from Heaven, They see Gods Name, and Gods
hand that hath been stretched forth upon <HI>London.</HI>
They know that both Plague and Fire have had
their commission from the God of Heaven; other|wise
they could not have wrought with such force
and power.</P>
<P>They see Gods Name, that is, the glorious at|tributes
of his name displayed. God proclaim|ed
his Name before <HI>Moses</HI> when he caused his
goodness to pass before him; and discovered
himself to be <HI>the Lord, the Lord God gracious and
merciful, slow to anger, abundant in lovingkind|ness,
goodness and truth,</HI> Exod. 34. 6. And God
hath proclaimed his Name before <HI>London,</HI> in
causing his judgements to come upon the City;
and hath declared himself to be <HI>the Lord, the
Lord God Holy and Iealous, a God that can be an|gry
when much provoked, and yet righteous in the
severest judgements which he doth inflict.</HI> A man
of wisdom may see Gods Name in <HI>Londons</HI>
judgements, and as he may see power and righte|ousness
in Gods name; so he may see grace and
goodness in the name of God, which hath passed
before the City; he may see and know that God
<PB N="193" REF="89">
hath a gracious meaning and design of good to
<HI>London</HI> in these judgements; he may see Gods
name, and hear Gods voice, and what it is that
he speaketh by the rod.</P>
<P>On that <HI>London</HI> were thus wise! that they
would open their eyes and see Gods Name!
Gods hand so just and righteous; as also open
their ears, and hear Gods voice, and understand
Gods design so gracious, and so much for their
good! O that God would open the ears of <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and bend them to the discipline of his judge|ments!
that with the loss of friends and relati|ons
by the Plague, and of houses and goods by
the Fire; they may not lose the good of these
Judgements too, though of another kind, yet
of far greater value, which God intends them.</P>
<P><HI>The enquiry then is,</HI> What meaneth the Lord by
the Plague, and by the Fire in the City? what doth
he call for by this terrible voice? and look for in
<HI>London,</HI> that these judgements may turn to their ad|vantage?</P>
<P>The duties which God expects from <HI>London</HI>
after such desolations by the Plague and Fire, are
these.</P>
<P>1. <HI>God expects that</HI> London <HI>should awake. Lon|don</HI>
hath been asleep; both the foolish and the
wise Virgins have been asleep; and when such a
voice hath come down in these judgements,
which have been revealed from Heaven, crying
in the midnight of their carnal security, <HI>Behold,
the great God is come forth from his place, and is
<PB N="194" REF="90">
entred into</HI> London <HI>in fury;</HI> surely all should
awake and arise, and prepare to meet him, see|ing
none can flee from him. God hath seemed
to be asleep, while he exercised so much pati|ence
towards <HI>London;</HI> his arm slept in his bo|some;
but now the Lord hath been awakened
with the loud cry of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Londons</HI> sins;
his arm hath awaked, and put on strength and
vengeance.</P>
<P><HI>Awake!</HI> then O <HI>London awake!</HI> open thine
eyes, draw thy curtains; come forth of thy bed;
look out of thy windows; <HI>Apparitions! Appa|ritions!</HI>
strange sights to be seen; Behold! Hea|ven
is opened, and God is come down upon
earth; cloathed with garments of lightning: God
is come down in his Majesty, and looks upon
<HI>London</HI> with a terrible countenance: Behold the
amazing terrour of God in the late strange and
prodigious Judgements. What! doest thou not
see him? surely thou art fast asleep still, thine
eyes are closed, the vail is before them.</P>
<P><HI>Awake! London Awake!</HI> open thine ears,
Harke! Oh the Trumpet that hath been sound|ing
from Heaven over the City exceeding loud!
Oh the Thundrings of the terrible voice of the
Angry God! the voice of the Lord hath been
powerful and very dreadful: What! canst thou
sleep under such a noise? surely thou art dead
asleep, dead in sin and security. What will
awaken thee, if these Judgements do not awaken
thee? If a shrill and loud trumpet do not pierce
thine ears, will soft musick enter? if the sound
of Cannons be not heard, can any expect that
Pistols should? It when the Lyon roareth in
<PB N="195" REF="90">
thine ears thou canst sleep still, will soft whispers
awaken thee? What will awaken thee if the
loud voice of these judgements do not awaken
thee? The Lord called upon thee before by his
Ministers, by his mercies: now he hath shouted
in thine ears by his Judgements.</P>
<P>Awake! <HI>London</HI> Awake! Thou hast been
rouzed out of thine habitation; methinks thou
shouldest be rouzed out of thy security: What!
sleep when dying! dying by the plague, and
tumbling into the grave! what sleep when burn|ing!
burning by the fire, and tumbling into de|solation!
What! sleep in a storm! when winds
are blowing, and waves roaring, sea entring,
and ship sinking! <HI>What meanest thou O sleeper!</HI>
could the Heathen Ship-master say, in such a
case, unto <HI>Ionah, chap.</HI> 1. 5, 6. when he lay fast
asleep in the sides of the ship: <HI>Arise, call upon thy
God; if God will think upon us that we perish
not.</HI> And may not I say, What meanest thou
O sleepy <HI>London;</HI> hast thou not perceived the
storm that hath beaten so fiercely on thy head?
dost thou not perceive that thy ship is shattered
and broken? and the Sea is coming in amain,
and thou art in danger of sinking, and that
quickly, unless some speedy course be taken for
prevention? And yet canst thou sleep still?
<HI>Awake!</HI> arise! call upon thy God, if so be he
will think upon us, that we perish not.</P>
<P>God calls upon <HI>sleepy sinners</HI> to awake. Sup|pose
you were under the power of cruel ene|mies,
that had killed your husbands, or wives,
or dear children and friends; and you knew not
how soon they might fall upon you, and cut
<PB N="196" REF="91">
your throats; could you sleep securely in the
same house with such persons?</P>
<P>You are under the power of Tyrannicall lusts,
which are far worse enemies; you are under the
reigning power of sin, which hath brought the
Plague into the City; and whereby some of you
have been deprived of these relations; and you
know not how soon sin may bring death upon
your selves, not only the first, but the second
death; not only temporal, but eternal death; and
deprive you not only of life, but happiness, and
all hopes of the least share in it for ever: And
yet can you sleep securely with sin in your hearts?
with such an enemy, with such a viper in your
bosomes?</P>
<P>When the Fire was in <HI>London</HI> I believe few of
you could take much sleep for divers nights to|gether;
when the Fire was burning in your
streets, and burning down your houses, you
could not sleep in your houses least the Fire
should have burned your persons too: And,
when the Fire of lust is within you, and burning
within you; when the fire of Gods anger is
kindled above you, and burning over you; and
the fire of hell so dreadful and unextinguishable is
burning beneath you; and you are hanging over
the burning lake by a twine thred, which ere
long will untwine of it self; and may ere you
are aware, and suddenly be cut or snapt asunder,
and then you must drop into the midst of flames;
can you sleep under the guilt and power of sin,
when you are in such danger?</P>
<P><HI>Awake!</HI> sinners <HI>awake!</HI> God doth not burn
you presently, but warns you first; he burns your
<PB N="197" REF="91">
houses, that you might awake, and scape a
more dreadful fire. <HI>Awake!</HI> sinners, when
will you awake! how often, how long, how
loud shall God call upon you, before you will
arise? <HI>Eph. 5. 14. Awake thou that sleepest, and
arise from the dead, and Iesus Christ shall give
thee life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of
the hands to rest.</HI> What! can you sleep any longer
now? Was not this your tone long ago, when
you were under the calls of the Word? and is it
the same under the Rod too? What will awaken
you? or when do you think you shall be awa|kened,
if still you lye down in the Bed of se|curity,
and love to slumber upon the lap of
pleasure, and after a little startle sleep faster than
before?</P>
<P>Ministers have preached, and you have slept
under their Sermons; but when God hath
preached, methinks you should awake. When
<HI>Paul</HI> preached to <HI>Felix</HI> a Sermon of Judgement,
<HI>Felix</HI> trembled. God hath preached One, nay
Two Sermons of Judgement; and that more
feelingly than <HI>Paul</HI> could; methinks you should
awake, and not drop asleep so soon, because
God gives you a little respite to learn his Ser|mon,
before he preach the third Sermon, which
may be your last and ruining Sermon. If you
do not awake by the sound of his Judgements
before you, you shall awake by the sense of his
Judgements upon you: If the Plague and Fire
of <HI>London</HI> do not awaken you, you shall be awa|kened
by the plagues and fire of Hell, which
you shall see and feel, but not be able to flee
<PB N="198" REF="92">
from, as here you might do, if presently awa|kened.</P>
<P>God calls upon sleepy Sinners to awake, and
God calls upon <HI>drowsie Saints</HI> to awake; and was
there not great need? were not the <HI>Ionahs</HI> gone
down into the sides of the Ship and lying on
Pillows? Were not the wise Virgins turning
foolish, sleeping with the rest, untrimm'd and
undress'd? Had there not of late a strange tor|pour
and benummedness seized upon the spirits
of Gods own people? Was not the ancient vi|gour
and activity, which once they had in the
ways and Worship of God, much abated and
decayed before these Judgements came upon
<HI>London?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Awake</HI> then ye drowsie Saints, <HI>awake!</HI> put on
your Garments, which you have laid aside to
the discovery of your Nakedness; shake your
selves from the dust, which hath covered and sul|lied
your faces, and loosen the bands of sleep. God
hath been thundring, your Father hath been
angry, and displeased with you as well as with
others: Your God hath spoken in his Jealousie,
and he hath spoken in his fury; he hath spoken
with a loud voice in righteousness and in Judge|ment.</P>
<P><HI>Awake!</HI> ye Children, your Father is stirring,
and knocking, and calling, yea he hath entred
your Chamber, and smitten you on this side
and that; and yet will you not arise? He hath
been crying in your Ears; now he is looking
and harkening whether you will cry in His, and
what you will say and do for the prevention of
the ruine of <HI>England,</HI> which he seems to be
<PB N="199" REF="92">
threatning. It is high time to awake out of sleep,
for now is the utter destruction of the City and
Nation neerer it may be than you believe or
imagine. <HI>Awake</HI> then, put off your Cloaths of
night and darkness, in which you have been
sleeping, and put on your Garments of light.
Cloath your selves with humility, and begirt you
with all your graces, and get you to Gods knee,
hang about his arm; put your selves in the breach;
<HI>It may be the Lord may think upon us, that we perish
not.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>The Lord doth now after his speaking by ter|rible
things, expect that</HI> London <HI>should stand in
awe of him.</HI> Gods Judgements made this Im|pression
upon <HI>David, Psal. 119. 120. My flesh
trembleth for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy
judgements.</HI> And see how the Prophet <HI>Habak|kuk</HI>
behaved himself, when God spake with a
terrible Voice, <HI>chap.</HI> 3. 2, &amp;c. <HI>O Lord, I have
heard thy speech and was afraid; when God came
down from</HI> Teman, <HI>the Holy One from Mount</HI> Pa|ran,
<HI>Selah; when the Pestilence went before him,
and burning Coals went forth at his feet; when the
Nations were drove asunder, the everlasting Moun|tains
were scattered, and the perpetual hills did bow;
when the Tents of</HI> Cushan <HI>were in affliction, and
the Curtains of the land of</HI> Midian <HI>did tremble:
when God did ride upon Horses, and his Bow was
made quite naked: when the Sun and Moon did
stand still in their habitations, at the light of his
arrows that went forth, at the shining of his glit|tering
Spear: when God did march through the
<PB N="200" REF="93">
land in his indignation, and walk through the Sea
with his horses, and did wound the head out of the
house of the wicked, and did strike through habita|tions
with his staves: at this,</HI> the Prophet is
<HI>afraid, his Belly trembled, his lips quivered at the
voice, rottenness entred into his bones, &amp;c.</HI> And
when God hath come down from Heaven, the
Holy One from Mount <HI>Sion, Selah.</HI> When the
Pestilence hath gone before him, and burning
Coals at his feet, when the Lord drove <HI>London</HI>
asunder, scattered the Inhabitants, and made
the stately buildings to bow and fall, whose rear|ing
up none can remember; when the Tents of
<HI>London</HI> have been in affliction, and the Curtains
of the City have trembled: when Death hath
been riding upon Horses, and his Bow hath been
made quite naked; when the Heavens have been
astonished at Gods Judgements, and the Sun and
Moon have hid their heads in their Habitations,
at the shining of his glittering Spear: When the
Lord hath marched through the City in his in|dignation,
hath wounded the heads of so many
wicked with his arrows, and struck through so
many Habitations with his staves: Oh how
should <HI>London</HI> tremble and quiver, and stand in
awe of this glorious Majesty, at the voice of these
terrible Judgements!</P>
<P><HI>Read and apply what the Lord speaketh by
the Prophet</HI> Isaias, <HI>Chap.</HI> 33. 13, 14. Hear ye
that are far off, what I have done, and ye that are
neer, acknowledge my might. The sinners of <HI>Sion</HI> are
afraid, fearfulness hath surprized the hypocrites; who
among us shall dwell with devouring fire? who among
us shall inhabit everlasting burnings? <HI>v.</HI> 18. Thine
<PB N="201" REF="93">
heart shall meditate terrour; where is the Scribe?
where is the receiver? where is he that counted the
Towers?</P>
<P>Methinks the sinners now in <HI>London</HI> should be
afraid, and fearfulness should surprize the Hypo|crites;
when God hath sent so many of their
number into the Everlasting burnings of Hell by
the Plague; and by such a devouring Fire hath
consumed so many Habitations.</P>
<P>Tremble ye Sinners at this, and be ye horribly
afraid all ye workers of iniquity! God hath
come down with a shout, the Lord with the
sound of a Trumpet: He hath taken his wea|pons
in his hand, and hath appeared in <HI>London</HI>
as a furious Enemy: should not this make the
sinners in the City to quake, and strike a dread
upon the spirits of the rebellious? When the
Lord hath spoken thus, and done thus; be|cause
of our sins, should not <HI>London,</HI> yea all
<HI>England, hear and fear, and do no more so wic|kedly.</HI></P>
<P>Because God was patient formerly, you pre|sumed:
because sentence against your evil works
was not speedily executed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 9.</NOTE> therefore your hearts
were hardened and resolved in your evil ways.
Because the Lord kept silence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 50.</NOTE> you thought he
was altogether such an one as your selves. You
thought it may be that he took no more notice
of you, than you did of him; or that you had
no more reason to fear him, than he had to fear
you. You thought it may be, that God had
forsaken the Earth; or had hidden his face, and
should never see your wickedness: And oh how
bold have you been, how audacious and fearless
<PB N="202" REF="94">
in sin? You were afraid to offend man though
a Worm, and yet you have not been afraid
to offend God the King of the whole World.
Mens Laws have kept you from some sins, but
the Laws of God have not put upon you the least
restraint. You have lived and sin'd as if there
were no God, or as if he had been so gentle, and
milde, and mercifull, that you might do any
thing to him, and he not be displeased with you:
or as if though he were displeased, yet his
displeasure were not to be regarded, and that
he had no power to execute vengeance upon
you.</P>
<P>But now Gods patience hath in a great mea|sure
been turned into fury. Now sinners you
may perceive a little that God can be angry;
and when his anger is kindled but a little, if it
doth express it self so dreadfully; what dread|full
expressions will there be of it, when it
breaks forth into an open flame? If his anger
be such in the day of some lighter, temporal
Judgements; what will it be in the day of the
Revelation of the treasures of it, upon all the
wicked, at the appearance of Jesus Christ?</P>
<P>But Gods vengeance now in these Judgements
should work your hearts to a fear and awe of
this righteous Judge, who hath done such exe|cutions
in the City; it should bridle and stay you
in that fearless course of sin, in which you were
rushing on as the Horse rusheth into the bat|tle.</P>
<P>When <HI>Balaams</HI> Ass saw the Angel stand in
the way with a drawn Sword, he was afraid,
and would not go forward, though spurr'd on,
<PB N="203" REF="94">
and beaten by his Master. And when God stands
in the way with his Sword of Judgement which
hath made such slaughter already, and is lifted
up again to strike you, methinks you should be
afraid, and turn back: It is the way to Hell that
God stands in by his Judgements; and will you
break through all into those flames? Oh stand
in awe, and sin not, commune with your own
hearts. Consider what hath been doing in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and who hath done these things. You have
neerly escaped it may be with your lives; Oh
learn to fear the glorious and fearfull Name of <HI>the
Lord God</HI> in these dreadfull Judgements.</P>
<P>And as God doth expect that the World and
his Enemies should stand in awe of him; so also
much more that the righteous and his people
should. Some it may be when God gave them
free access to him, and admitted unto familiari|ty
with him, and encouraged them to boldness
and confidence, and strowed their path with
nothing but Mercy; it may be might abuse his
goodness, and forget to mingle faith and love
with due reverence and respect; and began to
be too sawcy with God, and peremptory, and
did not consider their originall and distance, and
forgat the severity which they deserved for sin.
Therefore God appears in the way of these Judge|ments
with such terrible rebukes, that his own
people might be brought unto a due awe and
fear of his Name; that if they love him, they
may fear him too; if they pray with boldness,
they may pray also with reverence; if they re|joyce
in his goodness, they may tremble also at
his Judgements.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="95">
3. <HI>God doth expect that</HI> London <HI>should now
search and try their wayes.</HI> When God had pu|nished
<HI>Ierusalem</HI> with dreadfull Judgements, in
the Lamentation of which, the Prophet <HI>Iere|miah</HI>
doth spend a Book, see what use and im|provement
he calls upon the People to make
hereof, Lam. 3. 40. <HI>Let us search and try our
wayes, and turn again unto the Lord.</HI> This was
the practice of <HI>David</HI> in the day of his trouble,
<HI>Psal. 77. 6. I commune with mine own heart, and
my spirit made diligent search.</HI> It hath been <HI>a day
of Gods wrath in</HI> London, <HI>a day of trouble and
distress, a day of wasting and desolation, a day of
darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick
darkness,</HI> as it was in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> Zeph. 1. 15.
There have been dark and thick Clouds over <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
which in part have broken into dreadfull
storms and amazing Tempests of Gods anger ex|pressed
in the late Judgements; and all have
been the product of <HI>Londons</HI> sins, which may
yet produce far worse effects: <HI>London</HI> is then
called upon with a loud voice, to search and
finde out those sins which have been the trou|blers
of the City. I suppose that true Citizens
would be forward to search after those persons
that had a hand in the first kindling and carry|ing
on the Fire, which burned their Habitations
to the ground: give me leave, and I shall make
a discovery of <HI>Londons</HI> Incendiaries, how you
may finde the persons, how you may trace their
footsteps, what marks they bare, what their
Names are, and where their abode; and need I
<PB N="205" REF="95">
lead you far in the search? The <HI>sinners,</HI> the <HI>sinners</HI>
of <HI>London</HI> did kindle the Fire of <HI>London;</HI> it was sin
which fired the first house, and sin was like Oyl
poured upon the flames which put such fury
unto them, that none could withstand untill the
greatest part of the City was fallen and turned
into ashes: the Swearers, the Sabbath-breakers,
the Adulterers, the Drunkards, the Unrighte|ous,
the Prophane and the like sinners have been
<HI>Londons</HI> Incendiaries, and had a hand in pulling
down this and other judgements upon the place
where they lived; and is it hard to find out these
persons? are they gone far from the place of
their former abode? the skirts of <HI>London</HI> are re|maining,
and if you turn up the skirts, or turn
your eye under them, and look into the houses
standing about the City, may you not find many
of these persons, these vile sinners inhabiting,
who are still blowing hard at the Fire of Gods
anger, and pulling hard with cords of vanity and
sin, for further judgements? Search, <HI>London</HI>
search, and find out thine enemies, thy destroyers;
hast not thou destroyed thy self? Search, and
find out thy sins, which have brought such
mischiefs and ruines upon thee.</P>
<P>Sinners, enter into your closets, retire into your
selves, take the candle of the Lord, and look into
your inner rooms, make a strict search into
your hearts, find out those filthy Lusts which
lodge in dark corners, and bring them forth to
be slain; read over the old records of your
lives, consult the Register of your Consciences,
revolve in your minds your former sins; take
the glass of the Word, and look upon your faces
<PB N="206" REF="96">
in it, and see how many spots it will discover
which you never before did perceive; not beau|ty
spots, but spots of deformity, Plague-spots,
Death-marks, Hell-tokens, such as will bring
upon you inevitable misery, unless they be wiped
off; Take the Rule of the Word, and measure
your actions by it, and you may quickly per|ceive
how much they have fallen short, how
crooked they have been, <HI>Rectum est index sui &amp;
obliqui:</HI> compare your actions with the straight
rule of Gods Law, and you may find out many
irregularities; If you do not find out your sins,
your sins will find you out, and Gods judge|ments
will find you out; and if you be found
out in your sins, woe be to you; O the horrour
which will be upon your consciences when ruin|ing
judgements are inflicted upon you particu|larly,
and you cannot escape, when Death looks
you in the face, and comes with the sting of sin
in its mouth to devour you! But O the hor|rour
you will be under hereafter if you be taken
away in your sins! when your souls shall be
summoned, immediately after their separation,
unto the barr of God, where you will be searched
and tryed, and condemned to everlasting tor|ment,
by an inevitable and irreversible sentence of
the Judge himself: O therefore hearken to the
voice of God in these temporal judgements on
the City (after which you still remain alive,
through infinite patience) which calls upon
you to search and try your wayes, that you may
escape more fearful judgements which may be
preparing for you; labour to find out your sins
which are the cause of all judgements, temporal
<PB N="207" REF="96">
and eternal; and to help you in your search
after sin, read the Catalogue I have given you of
<HI>Londons</HI> sins, and examine your selves thereby;
be very serious, and thorow, and impartial in
this search; sequester your selves often from all
company; ease your mind of the load of worldly
business; leave the carriages at the bottom of the
hill; strive against temptations and indispositions
to the work; set your selves in the Presence of
the Heart-searching God; beg the help of his
spirit to discover to you what hath displeased
and provoked him; search after sin as offensive
to God, and as destructive to your selves, as
your worst enemy, as the cause of Plague and
Fire in <HI>London,</HI> and as that which will bring
the Plagues and Fire of Hell upon you, if it be
not found out and subdued.</P>
<P>4. God doth expect that <HI>London</HI> should acknow|ledge
their sins unto him. <HI>When the Prophet had
directed the people to search and try their wayes
after the execution of such Judgements upon
them,</HI> Lam. 3. 40. <HI>see the following direction,
v.</HI> 41, 42. Let us lift our hearts with our hands
unto God in the Heavens: we have trangressed, and
have rebelled, <HI>&amp;c. thus the Prophet doth confess
the sins of</HI> Ierusalem, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. 8, 9. Ierusalem
hath greatly sinned, therefore she is removed. Her
filthiness is in her skirts, she remembred not her
last end, therefore she came down wonderfully; <HI>and
thus the Daughter of</HI> Zion, <HI>as she bewaileth her
affliction, so she acknowledgeth her transgression,
v.</HI> 17, 18, 20. Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and
<PB N="208" REF="97">
there is none to comfort her. The Lord is righ|teous,
for I have rebelled against his commandment.
Behold O Lord for I am in distress, my bowels are
troubled, mine heart is turned within me, for I
have grievously rebelled. <HI>Thus</HI> Daniel <HI>after dread|ful
judgements maketh confession of the sins of
the people of</HI> Israel, <HI>chap.</HI> 9. 4, 5, 6. I prayed unto
the Lord, and made my confession, and said, O Lord
the great and Dreadful God, we have sinned and
committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and
have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts
and thy judgements: neither have we hearkened
unto thy servants the Prophets, which spake in thy
name to our Kings, our Princes, and our Fathers,
and to all the people of the land, <HI>and v.</HI> 11, 12.
Yea all <HI>Israel</HI> have transgressed thy law, by depart|ing,
that they might not obey thy voice; therefore
the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is
written in the law of <HI>Moses</HI> the servant of God,
because we have sinned against him: And he hath
confirmed his word which he spake against us, and
against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon
us a great evil: for under the whole Heaven hath it
not been done, as it hath been done upon <HI>Jeru|salem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>God doth expect that</HI> London <HI>should find out
their sins, and having found them, that they
should make confession of them: O that the
Prophane and ungodly generation in</HI> London,
<HI>whose sins have been enumerated in the Ca|talogue,
would be perswaded to get alone by
themselves, and consider their evil wayes, and
what the consequents of their sins have been
in bringing down temporal Judgements, what
<PB N="209" REF="97">
the consequence of their sins is like to be, even
the bringing upon them eternal Judgements,
and that they would fall down and pro|strate
themselves at Gods foot, and covering
their cheeks with shame and blushing, because
of their filthiness and foul sins under the view
of so holy an eye, that they would acknowledge
their transgressions unto him not only in gene|ral,
but also particularly with their heinous ag|gravations!
O that with an inward deep sense,
with a bleeding, broken heart, they would fill
their mouths with confessions! that they would
take to themselves words and say,</HI> We have re|belled
against thee O Lord, and done wickedly, and
grievously offended thee; so foolish have we been,
and ignorant of thee, we have been worse than beasts
before thee; the Oxe acknowledgeth his owner, and the
Ass his master; but, though we are thy creatures
and live upon thy bounty, and are daily at thy find|ing,
yet we have not acknowledged thee, and have
had less consideration, than those creatures, who have
had no reason; we have been a sinful people, laden
with iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children that
have been corrupters, who have forsaken thee, and
by our wickedness provoked thee to anger. We have
been stubborn and disobedient; serving thine ene|mies,
the devil and our own lusts, but have neglected,
yea refused to serve and worship thee in our families and
closets, living as if there had been no God in the world.
We have seldom if ever taken thy Name into our mouths,
unless it hath been in vain, unless in our Oaths and
Curses. We have prophaned thy Sabboths, and de|filed
thine ordinances, and have often been more
wicked on the Lords day, than any day of the week
<PB N="210" REF="98">
besides. When we were children we disobeyed our
Parents, but disobeyed thee much more, who didest
command us to honour them; when we were chil|dren
in years, we were grown Men and Women
in sin; when we were weak in body, we were
strong in spirit to commit iniquity; we learnt the
trade of sin before any other, and were apt Schol|lars
in the School of the Devil, when dull and
blockish to learn any thing, which was good; we
were wise to do evil, when to do good we had
no understanding; our iniquities have increased
over our heads, faster than our years have done:
Since we have been governours of others, we have
had no government upon our own spirits, and have
endeavoured to lead those under our charge with us
in the way to Hell, instead of labouring to draw
them into the way of Heaven, by our example, com|mand,
and perswasions; and we have filled up all
our relations with sin, instead of filling them up
with a duty. If we have not murdered any with
our hand, we have murdered many with our tongue,
swords have been in our lips, and bitter reviling
speeches in our mouths, heart murder we have been
guilty of, O the inordinate anger that hath boiled
in our hearts! O the envy and malice which have
gnawed our spirits, and been working daily within
us! and especially those persons have been most hated
by us, who have had thine image upon them, and
have been best beloved by thee; we have scorned
them, and looked upon them as mean-spirited peo|ple;
we have separated them from our company,
as those who damp and spoil our mirth by their
words and looks of reproof; yea, we have persecu|ted
them as seditious and factious persons, when
<PB N="211" REF="98">
in truth it was their holiness and conversation that
did contradict and condemn our wicked practices,
which did stir up our anger against them; we have
scoft at them, who have prayed for us, and we
have lookt upon them, and dealt with them as our
enemies, because so to our lusts, who were the best
friends to our souls, and above all things desired
our Salvation. Thou hast given us Corn, and
Wine, and Oyle, and plentiful provisions for our
body, but we have abused thy mercies by our in|temperance
and luxury: we have been guilty of
drunkenness and gluttony; we have indulged our
flesh and sensual appetite; we have lived in plea|sure
and been wanton; we wallowed, like so many
swine, in the mire and dung of some filthy sins,
which it is a shame to speak of; we have had eyes
and hearts full of lusts and adultery, and have
broken forth into such vile actual sins of unclean|nesses,
as would raise blushes in modest cheeks to
hear but the mention of; we have been unjust and
unrighteous in our dealing, have wronged and de|frauded
our neighbour, though thou hast threatned to
be avenged on all such persons; O the lyes we have
spoken, the slanderous backbiting speeches we have
uttered! O the discontentment, murmuring, envy|ing,
evil concupiscence, inordinate affection, and wick|ed
distempers which have been in our spirits!
and though we have broken all thy Laws, and
are guilty of such notorious sins, yet O the impen|tency
and hardness of our hearts! though no Sal|vation
is attainable but by Christ, who is freely
tendered unto us, yet O the unbelief of our hearts,
and neglect of our own Salvation! We have
sinned, we have sinned against thee, and what
<PB N="212" REF="99">
shall we do unto thee, O thou preserver of men!</P>
<P>God expects that <HI>London</HI> should make Con|fession
of their sin, and it could be wish'd that
<HI>London</HI> would joyn together like one man in
this work; but if this cannot be, and they want
common mouths to open their hearts and sins
before the Lord in particular Confession, let
every one of them be a Mouth to himself, and get
into his Closet, and there acknowledge <HI>Londons</HI>
sins; and if those who are most guilty, do neglect
this work, let Gods people do it in their room,
and confess not only their own sins, but also the
sins of the profane and wicked where they live,
and that not only because God is dishonour'd,
but also because they are in danger of being ruin'd
by the unbewail'd sins of others.</P>
<P>5. <HI>God doth expect that</HI> London <HI>should be hum|ble
under these Iudgements.</HI> God inflicted Judge|ments
on the children of <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilder|ness,
<HI>to humble them,</HI> Deut. 8. 16. and he pro|miseth
after the sorest distresses which he brings
his people into for their sins, to remember his
Covenant, <HI>if their uncircumcised heart be humbled,</HI>
Levit. 26. 40, 41, 42. Yea he promiseth to exalt
such in due time, <HI>who humble themselves under
his mighty hand,</HI> 1 Pet. 5. 6. Gods mighty hand
hath been stretched forth upon <HI>London,</HI> God
expects that <HI>London</HI> should be humble; he hath
humbled them by his Judgements, he expects
that they should humble themselves under his
Judgements; God hath stained the Pride of
<HI>London,</HI> he expects that they should let down
<PB N="213" REF="99">
their plumes; he hath brought them down, and
he expects that they should lye low; he hath
brought Poverty upon many of them in regard
of their Estates, and he expects that all of them
should be poor in regard of their Spirits; he
hath made many of them mean in regard of their
Condition, and he expects that their disposition
and affection should be accordingly: God hath
laid many Persons in the dust by the Plague,
and he hath laid many Houses in the dust by
the Fire, and he expects that those which sur|vive
and remain after such Judgements should
lay themselves in the dust for their sins. Hum|ble
thy self them, O <HI>London,</HI> humble thy self be|fore
the Lord, lick the dust of his feet, put off
thy Ornaments, and gird thee with Sackcloth,
cloath thy self with Humility. God hath spit
in thy face, wilt thou be proud of thy beauty
again? he hath burnt the City with Fire, wilt
thou be proud of thy Buildings and stately Edi|fices
any more? he hath consumed much of the
fuel of thy pride, and he expects that thy pride
should be abated, and that thou shouldest a|base
thy self, and humble thy self before
him.</P>
<P>6. <HI>God doth expect that</HI> London <HI>should accept
of the punishment of their iniquity.</HI> Levit. 26. 40,
41, 42. <HI>If my people shall confess their iniquity, and
the iniquity of their Fathers, and be humbled, and
accept the punishment of their iniquity, then will I
remember my Covenant, and remember the land.</HI>
God expects that <HI>London</HI> should justifie him in
<PB N="214" REF="100">
the severest Judgements which he hath inflicted
upon them; as they should acknowledge their
sins, so they should acknowledge their demerit,
and that the Lord hath punished them no more,
yea that he hath punished them less than their
iniquities have deserved: As they should bring
a bill of Inditement against themselves, so they
should bring a bill of Acquittance of God; God
expects that they should say, as <HI>Neh. 9. 33. Thou
art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast
done right, but we have done wickedly.</HI> Or as
Dan. 9. 7, 8. <HI>O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto
thee, but unto us confusion of faces, because we have
sinned against thee.</HI> Let not <HI>London</HI> murmure or
repine, let not <HI>London</HI> finde fault and complain
of God, because of his Judgements, <HI>Lam. 3. 39.
Why doth the living man complain, a man for the
punishment of his sin?</HI> God hath opened his
mouth, and spoken <HI>terribly,</HI> but let <HI>London</HI> shut
her mouth, because God hath spoken <HI>Righte|ously;</HI>
God hath spoken with a loud Voice, let
<HI>London</HI> be in deep silence; I <HI>was dumb,</HI> I <HI>opened
not my mouth,</HI> saith <HI>David, because thou didst it,</HI>
Psal. 39. 9. When <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> the two
Sons of <HI>Aaron</HI> were consumed with Fire from
Heaven, for offering strange Fire before the Lord,
It is said, that <HI>Aaron held his peace,</HI> Lev. 10. 1,
2, 3. So when God hath consumed the City of
<HI>London</HI> with Fire, for the sins of the Inhabitants,
let them hold their peace, because they have de|served
it. Let <HI>London</HI> be still, and know that
God is righteous; let <HI>London</HI> lay her hand upon
her mouth, and her mouth in the dust; let
<HI>London</HI> close up her lips, and seal them up with
<PB N="215" REF="100">
silence; or if she open them, let her mouth be
filled with Confessions, not with Complaints;
or if she complain, let her complain to God, but
let her not complain of him; if she complain,
let her complain against her self, but let her not
complain against God; let her complain of her
own sin and wickedness, but not of Gods Judge|ment
so righteous. Let <HI>London</HI> wonder it is
no worse with her, when both her sin and her
danger was so great; let her wonder, when God
was so angry, that he should put any restraint
upon it; that when wrath was come forth, that
it proceeded no further; let her wonder that
the Plague did not quite depopulate her, and
that the Fire did not wholly consume her; let
her wonder it is so well with her, that she is
not made a Desolation, and say, <HI>It is the Lords
mercies we are not consumed,</HI> Lam. 3. 22.</P>
<P>7. God doth expect, that <HI>London</HI> should mourn
for her sins. <HI>We read,</HI> Ier. 3. 21. A voice was
heard upon the high places, weeping and supplica|tions
of the house of <HI>Israel. When the terrible
voice of Gods Judgements hath been heard in</HI>
London, <HI>God doth hearken for the voice of Weep|ing
and Supplications; this Gods voice doth call
for; when breaches were made in the City of</HI>
David, <HI>Isa.</HI> 22. 9. then did the Lord of hosts call to
weeping, and to mourning, to baldness, and to gird|ing
with sackcloth, <HI>v. 11. and when instead here|of
there was</HI> joy and gladnesse, eating flesh, and
drinking wine, <HI>the Lord is so angry, that he
threatneth,</HI> surely this iniquity shall not be purged
<PB N="216" REF="101">
<HI>from you till you die,</HI> v. 13, 14. See also what the
Lord calls for to the Daughter of <HI>Sion</HI> under her
Judgements, Lam. 2. 18, 19. <HI>Let tears run down
like a river day and night, give thy self no rest, let
not the apple of thine eye cease: Arise, cry in the
night, in the beginning of the Watches pour out thine
heart like water before the face of the Lord.</HI> God
doth not only expect that <HI>his Ministers and
Priests should weep between the Porch and the Altar,</HI>
when sore Judgements are upon his Land, as
<HI>Ioel</HI> 2. 17. but also that the People should weep
too, <HI>that the Bridegroom should go forth of his Cham|ber,
and the Bride out of her closet,</HI> as <HI>v.</HI> 16. that
people should be <HI>afflicted, mourn and weep, that
their laughter should be turned into mourning, and
their joy into heaviness,</HI> Jam. 4. 9. He expects
that those which escape his Judgements <HI>should
be like Doves upon the mountains, every one mourn|ing
for his iniquities,</HI> as Ezek. 6. 16. <HI>London</HI> may
mourn for her Judgements which have been so
dreadfull, but God expects they should mourn
more for his displeasure, which hath been the
cause of these Judgements, and most of all for
their sins, which have been the cause of his dis|pleasure.</P>
<P><HI>Weep,</HI> London, <HI>weep</HI> for thy sins, which have
been so many and provoking; let thine eye affect
thine heart: When thou lookest into thy Bury|ing
places, and thinkest how many of thy people
have lately there taken up their habitation; it
should draw tears from thine eyes to think of
thy sins, which opened the doors of those Lodg|ings
unto them: Methinks, when thou passest
thorow thy ruinous Habitations, and seest the
<PB N="217" REF="101">
heaps of Stones at the top of thy streets, when
thou viewest thy half-Churches and bare Steeples,
and ragged Walls, and open Vaults, and the dis|mal
Solitude in those places, which not long
ago were full of people, it should fill thine heart
with sorrow for thy sins, which have kindled
such anger in the breast of God, as to send the
late dreadfull Fire, which hath made such deso|lations.</P>
<P><HI>Mourn,</HI> London, <HI>mourn,</HI> put on Sackcloth,
thou seest in part what an evil thing and a bitter
it is, to offend a Holy and Jealous God; the
effects of sin here are fearfull sometimes, what
evil is there is sin then which is the cause of thy
Ruines. God looks now that the sinners of <HI>Lon|don</HI>
should become Mourners: We read of a
Mark which was set upon the foreheads of them
in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which did mourn and cry out for
the Abominations that were done in the midst
thereof, and they were separated from temporal
destruction which was brought upon the rest,
<HI>Ezek.</HI> 9. 4. 6. God doth set a mark upon them
that mourn in <HI>London</HI> for the sins of <HI>London,</HI> and
however he may deal with them in regard of
temporal Calamities, be sure he will separate
them, and preserve them from eternal destructi|on.</P>
<P>Methinks, the fall of <HI>London</HI> calls for a
Mourning like the <HI>Mourning of</HI> Hadadrimmon
<HI>in the Valley of</HI> Megiddo, where <HI>Iosiah</HI> fell in bat|tle,
<HI>Zach.</HI> 12. 11. And there should not only be
publick mourning, but also private mourning,
and secret mourning; Families apart, and Per|sons
apart: It becomes Christians now, after such
<PB N="218" REF="102">
strokes of Gods wrath, to keep secret Fasts, to
bewail <HI>Londons</HI> ruines, especially to bewail <HI>Lon|dons</HI>
sins; their eyes should weep in secret pla|ces,
for the Abominations committed in the Ci|ty,
and bedew Gods feet with their tears, that
if possible they might turn away his displea|sure.</P>
<P>8. <HI>God doth expect that</HI> London <HI>should labour
to pacifie his anger.</HI> When God threatned to
send the Sword, and to cut off from <HI>Israel the
head and the tail, the branch and the rush in one
day,</HI> and to send the Famine so sore that they
should <HI>eat every man the flesh of his own arm,</HI> yet
it is said, <HI>For all this his anger is not turned away,
but his hand is stretched out still,</HI> Isa. 9. 14, 17,
20, 21. And now God hath executed his Judge|ments
of Plague and Fire in <HI>London,</HI> have not
we reason to fear that his anger is not yet turned
away, but his hand is stretched out still? When
the <HI>houses</HI> of <HI>London</HI> were consumed, which were
the fuel to the late Fire, then the Fire quickly
went out; and if the <HI>sins</HI> of <HI>London</HI> had been
consumed with the houses, if the Inhabitants
of the City had not brought forth their sins,
when they were forced to leave their goods be|hinde
unto the flames, then we should have
reason to think that the Fire of Gods anger was
gone out, and his wrath turned away from the
escaped remnant of <HI>London,</HI> insomuch as the sins
of <HI>London</HI> have been the fuel, as it were to this
Dreadful Fire; but when so much sin after such
Judgements is saved alive, untouch'd, and un|mortified;
<PB N="219" REF="102">
when the Plague of sin doth rage so
much after the Plague of Pestilence is removed;
and the Fire of lust doth burn so much, when
the other Fire is extinguished; when London|ers
who have taken new houses, have brought
into them their old hearts, and live in the pra|ctice
of their old sins; when the Swearers, and
Prophane, the Drunkards and Unclean, the Co|vetous,
Unrighteous, and loose Livers still perse|vere
in their wicked courses, and no Judge|ment
will put a stop to them, but they grow
more hardened and incorrigible, when as it is
said, <HI>Ier.</HI> 5. 3. the Lord hath <HI>stricken them</HI> for
sin, <HI>but they are not grieved, consumed them, but
they refuse to receive correction, making their faces
harder than a rock, and refuse to return:</HI> what
can we conclude, but that Gods anger doth still
remain, yea is more enraged by this aggravati|on
of their wickedness, and that he is stretch|ing
forth his hand to give them another blow.</P>
<P>God doth expect that <HI>London</HI> should use some
means to pacifie his anger; and he gives them
time for it by the pauses which he m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">kes be|tween
his Judgements, being still slow to anger,
and unwilling, if he be not even forced unto it,
utterly to destroy this place, where his Name
hath been called upon. O that <HI>London</HI> would
be perswaded unto this Duty, which doth so
much concern their safety and happiness: when
the Fire was in <HI>London,</HI> and it burned so furiously
and dreadfully on the Monday, and Tuesday,
Londoners hearts were sunk within them,
having little hopes of getting victory over this
conquerer, which marched thorow their streets,
<PB N="220" REF="103">
and therefore little resistance was made, but all
were busily employed in flying from him, with
their goods; but when the fury of the Fire was
something abated on the Wednesday, and they
began to conceive any hopes that it might be
extinguished; then they pluck up their spirits,
and join their forces, and many thousand hands
are at work in drawing waters, and pouring
them upon the Flames, and their pains through
Gods blessing was not unsuccessful: The Fire
of Gods wrath which shall devour the wicked
and burn them everlastingly, will be so furious
and dreadful that the hearts of the damned will
sink under it without the least hopes of ever
extinguishing this Flame, or flying from it
when it hath once got hold of them: And there|fore
they will not attempt, but let alone all en|deavours
for ever to turn away Gods displea|sure,
and to put out the unquenchable Fire of
Hell: but the Fire of Gods wrath and anger
<HI>here</HI> may be put out, and the <HI>flames of his an|ger</HI>
may be turned into <HI>flames of Love;</HI> Gods
anger which hath been so hot against <HI>London</HI>
may be cooled, his wrath alleviated and his
displeasure removed: there is Hope in <HI>Israel</HI>
concerning this thing, God is not yet grown so
furious that he will not be spoken unto, he is
easie to be entreated, and therefore <HI>London</HI> may
be encouraged in their endeavours to pacifie
his anger. Let them not say as <HI>Israel</HI> of old,
Jer. 2. 25. <HI>There is no hope, no, for I have loved
strangers, and after them will I go.</HI> Though Gods
anger be not yet turned away, yet it <HI>may</HI> be
turned away; and though one hand be stretch|ed
<PB N="221" REF="103">
out to destroy you, yet the other hand is
stretched forth to save you; <HI>for he stretcheth forth
his hand all the day long, to a disobedient and
gain-saying people,</HI> Rom. 10. 21. O Labour then
to pacifie Gods anger, to quench this Fire; arise
and gird your selves with humility; pluck up
your spirits, and stir up your selves to lay hold
on God, and stop him in the march of his Judge|ments;
bring forth your buckets, draw water,
and pour it forth before the Lord; let your eyes
be like Fountains of tears, the voice of weep|ing,
and mourning for sin, doth turn Gods bow|els
within him, <HI>Ier.</HI> 31. 18, 19, 20. I have sure|ly
heard <HI>Ephraim</HI> bemoaning himself, <HI>Thou hast
chastised me, and I was chastised,</HI> &amp;c. and when
he <HI>repented</HI> after such chastisements, and was
<HI>ashamed</HI> of his sin, God doth relent, and his bow|els
are moved for him, <HI>Is</HI> Ephraim <HI>my dear Son!
is he a pleasant Child? for since I spake against
him, I earnestly remember him still, therefore my
bowels are troubled for him; and I will surely have
mercy upon him saith the Lord.</HI> If <HI>London</HI> would
be chastised, and receive the impressions of grief
and shame for their sins by these Judgements,
Gods bowels would be moved, and his fierce
anger would be changed into tender compassi|ons;
and though he hath spoken terribly against
<HI>London,</HI> yet he would now speak comfortably
unto her, he would earnestly remember her,
and make her glad according to the dayes where|in
he hath afflicted her, and the years wherein
she hath seen evil; there is an excellent vertue
in the tears of true repentance accompanied with
the blood of Christ, applyed by faith to quench
the fire of Gods anger.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="104">
Sinners, God is angry with you, <HI>Psal. 7. 11.
God is angry with the wicked every day,</HI> and it is
worse to have God angry with you, than all the
men in the world; his favour is better than Life,
his displeasure is worse than Death: to have
God angry with you, who is so Just and Jea|lous,
who is so potent and furious, is very dread|ful;
if the wrath of an earthly King be like the
roaring of a Lyon, what is the wrath of the
King of Heaven? and when his anger is stirred
up by your sins, and blown into a flame, and
breaks forth upon you, what will you do?
you cannot hide your selves in any place where
his all seeing eye will not find you; you can|not
flie into any place, where his stretched-forth
arm will not reach you; you cannot gather such
strength as to make head against him, and defend
your selves from the strokes of his vengeance,
<HI>who can stand in his sight when once he is angry?</HI>
Psal. 76. 7. O then labour to pacifie his anger,
you cannot fly from him, O then fly unto him;
you cannot stand in his sight when he is angry,
O then fall down at his feet; make peace with
this adversary, whilest you are upon the way,
before he deliver you to the officer Death, and
cast you into the prison of Hell.</P>
<P>Sinners, Gods patience doth as yet hold his
arm; and his mercy calls upon you to repent,
and he invites you to make your peace with
him, Isa. 27. 4, 5. <HI>Who would set the briers and
thorns against me in battle, I would go thorow them,
I would burn them together; or let him take hold
on my strength, and make peace with me, and he
shall make peace with me.</HI> You will be like bri|ers
<PB N="223" REF="104">
and thorns, which will easily take fire, and
quickly be consumed in the time of Gods anger;
and if briers and thorns do offer to contend with
devouring Fire, what will be the issue, but the
burning of them up without remedy; you will
find it sharp and painful for your feet, if you
kick against the pricks; you will dash out your
brains, if you run your head against a Rock, or
a brazen wall; none ever hardened themselves
against God, and prospered; none ever fought
against the God of Heaven by their sins, but
they were wounded, and in the end destroyed;
sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth Death,
and wrath, and misery for ever: O then lay
hold on Gods strength, and make peace with
him; run to him, take hold of the Scepter of
grace and reconciliation, which is held forth unto
you; take hold of his arm, and plead with him
for mercy; take hold of his Son who is offered
to you, who is set forth to be a propitiation for
the remission of sins which are past through the
forbearance of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 25. as yet God
hath forborn you; as yet you are on this side
of the Grave, and Hell, and there is a possibility
of turning away Gods anger which is kind|led
against you, of flying from that wrath which
is pursuing of you, of escaping those miseries
which are preparing for you; and therefore lay
hold on Christ who is freely tendered unto you,
who is able and willing to save you, and make
your peace with the Father, and to procure a
pardon for you; and further to move you, you
are not only offered peace and reconciliation,
but you are entreated to be reconciled, Ministers
<PB N="224" REF="105">
entreat you, yea God himself, and Jesus Christ
by us, doth entreat, and pray, and beseech you,
that you would accept of reconciliation, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI>
5. 20. Be astonished O ye Heavens! and wonder
Oye Angels! Be astonished much more ye Sin|ners!
and be rapt up with admiration O ye
Rebels! the King of glory against whom you
have rebelled, and who could crush you so easily
without any injury to himself, is not only wil|ling
to lay aside his anger, but also entreats you
to accept of reconciliation; heartily embrace
Jesus Christ upon his own terms, and the work
will be done, otherwise the fury of the Lord
will be so much the more provoked, and the
Fire of his anger will break forth into such a
flame, as none shall be able to quench; other|wise
the Lord will be so much the more enraged
against you, and meet you like a <HI>roaring and de|vouring
Lyon,</HI> or <HI>like a Bear bereaved of her Whelps;
and rent the Caul of your heart, yea tear you in
pieces, when there shall be none to deliver,</HI> Hos. 13.
7, 8. Psal. 50. 22.</P>
<P>9. <HI>God doth expect that</HI> London <HI>should turn
from her evil wayes,</HI> 2 Chron. 7. 14. The Lord
maketh a sweet promise under the dreadfull
Judgements of Famine or Pestilence, which some|times
he sendeth upon his people for their sins,
<HI>If my people which are called by my name shall hum|ble
themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn
from their wicked wayes: then will I hear from
Heaven, and forgive their sin, and will heal their
Land.</HI> God doth not only expect that Lon|doners
<PB N="225" REF="105">
should now acknowledge their sins, and
humble themselves, and mourn for their sins;
but also that they should turn from them, other|wise
pardon, and healing, and his favour is not
to be obtained, neither are further Judgements
likely to be prevented; they must <HI>confess and
forsake their sins, if they would find mercy,</HI> Prov.
28. 13. the wicked must <HI>forsake their way</HI> of
sin, and <HI>turn unto the Lord,</HI> and then <HI>he will have
mercy, and abundantly pardon,</HI> Isa. 55. 7. God
threatneth to go on to punish such as go on to
transgress, Psal. 68. 21. <HI>He will wound the head
of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such as go on
still in their trespasses.</HI></P>
<P>Break off then your sins by repentance, and
cast away all your transgressions from you; put
away the evil of your doings from before the
holy and jealous eyes of God; cease to do evil;
cleanse your hands you sinners, and purifie your
hearts ye wickedly-minded; wash your selves in
the fountain of Christs blood set open to you,
that you may be cleansed from all filthiness of
flesh and spirit, and be partakers of holiness, and
the divine nature; Deny all ungodliness and
worldly lusts; abstain from flesh-pleasing sins,
which war against the soul<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters"> and be not con|formed
to the wicked cust<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters">es of wicked men,
neither follow this ungodly generation to do
evil, much less run with them to the same ex|cess
of riot; but be ye transformed by the re|newing
of your minds, and live soberly, righte|ously
and godly in this present evil world; and
let the time past of your lives be sufficient where|in
you have wrought the will of the flesh, and
<PB N="226" REF="106">
served divers lusts, and cast a blot upon the pro|fession
of Christianity: now be blameless, and
harmless, and unrebukeable in the midst of
a crooked and perverse Nation, cast off the
works of darkness; lay aside your night-vail of
ignorance; put on the robes of light; walk ho|nestly,
as in the day, shining as lights where you
live; forbear all works of darkness and sin; and
as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye
holy in all manner of conversation.</P>
<P>Sinners, turn from your evil wayes, otherwise
iniquity will be your ruine.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Drunkards turn from your evil wayes;</HI> over|charge
not your selves with excess, where God
allows you enough for use; <HI>Look not upon the
Wine when it is red, when it giveth its colour in
the Cup, when it sparkleth and moveth it self aright:
At last it biteth like a Serpent, and stingeth like an
Adder,</HI> Prov. 23. 31, 32. <HI>wounds</HI> and <HI>woe</HI> are the
issue of excessive drinking, <HI>v.</HI> 29. this sin may
be sweet and pleasing to the eye and appetite in
the temptation; but it will wound and sting the
conscience, worse than an Adder or Serpent can
do the body, in the reflection; God hath put
bitterness into the Cup by his Judgements, and
will you drink as deep as before? are you re|solved
to taste the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">reggs that lye at bottome?
the Cup hath poison in it, soul-poison, and will
you drink of it still, though you murder and
destroy your souls for ever by this sin? the Cup
hath wrath in it, the wrath of an angry God; and
is it good for you to drink off the Wine of Gods
wrath? Drunkenness hath been your sin, and if
you go on, God threatneth that Drunkenness
<PB N="227" REF="106">
shall be your punishment, Jer. 15. 12. <HI>Speak un|to
them this word, thus saith the Lord, every bottle
shall be filled with Wine;</HI> Drunkards like this
very well, they are very well pleased that their
bottles shall be filled with Wine, that they may
empty them, but understand the meaning,
v. 13, 14. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, I will fill all
the inhabitants of the Land with Drunkenness;
and I will dash them one against another, even the
Fathers, and the Sans together: I will not pity,
nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.</HI> Drunk|ards,
you reel and fall sometimes with your sin;
God will make you reel and fall by his Judge|ments,
and dash you one upon another, yea dash
you in pieces, and destroy you without pity or
mercy. Will you not forbear your Cups, and
excesses, God will put a Cup of trembling and
astonishment into your hand; he will put Gall
and Wormwood into your Cup, and make you
taste the bitter effects of this sin; if he do not
severely scourge you for this sin here, he will be
sure to torment you for this sin for ever.</P>
<P>Turn ye Drunkards from your evil wayes;
vomit up your sin by repentance; weep and
mourn for all your sinfull mirth and jollity;
and take heed of returning with the Dog, and
licking up the Vomit which you have disgorged:
avoid the occasions of this sin; shun the com|pany
of such as have been your tempters; take
heed of coming into the places where you have
been drawn in to commit it; make a Covenant
with your feet that they may never lead you
out of the way of God, into such places, where
you have been so often overtaken; curb and re|strain
<PB N="228" REF="107">
your appetite, take some kind of holy re|venge
upon your selves; deny your selves some
things which are lawfull in themselves, because
occasions of sin unto you; and instead of filling
your selves with Wine, or strong Drink unto drun|kenness,
and excess; labour to be filled with the
spirit, and by the spirit to mortifie this and all
other deeds of the body, and rather let the
wicked wonder at you, and speak evil of you
for your sobriety, than God hate you, and bring
destruction upon you for your intemperance.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Adulterers Turn from your evil wayes;</HI> come
out of the unclean bed; wallow not any longer
in this besmearing mire: are you fallen into the
ditch, get up and come forth with speed, and
wash your garments from the spots, which
they have received; are you taken in the net,
and ensnared in adulterous embracements, de|liver
your selves like a Roe from the net of the
Hunter, and like a Bird from the snare of the
Fowler; Lust not after the beauty and enjoy|ment
of Adulterous Women; let not the soft
and sweet language of their lips entice you;
nor the sparkling motions of their eyes enflame
you; put not fire into your bosomes, and take
heed of walking upon burning Coals; why will
you consume your body, and time, and sub|stance,
which cannot be redeemed? why will
you bring upon your selves a wound and dishonor
which cannot be wiped off? Why will you be
like Oxen which go to the slaughter, and be such
fools, as to bring upon your selves destruction?</P>
<P>Turn from your evil wayes; dare not to go
forward in that way which leads unto death and
<PB N="229" REF="107">
hell. <HI>Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed
undefiled, but Whoremongers, and Adulterers God
will judge,</HI> Heb. 13. 4. God hath shot his arrows
into the City, and wounded many Adulterers for
this sin, that had before defiled and wounded
themselves by it; and will you go on till a dart
pierce thorow your Liver? the beginning of
the sin is sweet like honey, but will not the end
of it be more bitter than wormwood? and if a
little short pleasure of the flesh be so desirable,
will not the extream endless pain, it will pro|duce,
be intollerable? can you be content to lye
so many millions of years under the horrible
tortures of Hell, for a little present sensual de|light,
which when reaped, cannot yield you sa|tisfaction?
is it sweet to fall into the arms of
an adulterous woman; and will it not be bitter,
yea a <HI>fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the
Living God,</HI> Heb. 10. 31. especially when he is
irreconcileably angry, and his anger burns like
fire which is devouring, and unquenchable?
you have seen the Fire which hath burnt down
the City how dreadfull it was; the fire of Lust
within you, is worse; and the Fire of Hell be|neath
you, which is preparing for you, and un|to
which by this sin you are hastening, is a
thousand fold more dreadfull; (of which more
by and by) and yet will you go on? O Turn
from your adulterous wayes; come not near the
door of such houses, where you have had incen|tives
to Lust, and opportunities for such lewd
practices; make a Covenant with your eyes, the
spark is catcht at the eye, not only from it, but
also by it; the spark that falling upon the tinder
<PB N="230" REF="108">
of an adulterous heart, puts it into a flame;
do not look upon the Maid or Woman, that you
may not think; do not think, that you may not
lust; do not touch, that you may not desire to
taste; do not toy, least you be caught; do not
come too near the brink, least you fall into the
stream before you are aware; take heed of spe|culative
uncleanness, as you would be kept from
actual uncleanness; take heed of self-pollutions,
as you would be kept from adultery with others;
avoid occasions of this sin, come not into such
Company and places where you may have oppor|tunity
to commit it; flee youthfull lusts which
warr against the soul; keep your mindes pure
and chaste; resist the first suggestions to this sin;
quench the fire, when it begins to kindle; look
to the issue and consequents of this sin; remem|ber
that the holy eye of God is upon you, in
your most secret retirements, and he will ere long
call you to an account.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Swearers, turn from your evil wayes.</HI> Re|member
the Third Commandment, unto which
a Threatning is annexed, of Gods charg|ing
guilt especially upon the breakers hereof,
<HI>Exod. 20. 7. Thou shalt not take the Name of the
Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him
guiltless, that taketh his Name in vain.</HI> The very
use of the Name of God irreverently, is a breach
of this Command; but to swear by the Name
of God in ordinary discourse, is a gross breach
of it; which as it affronts God highly, so it will
bring Condemnation certainly upon the guilty,
that do not repent and forbear. When God
hath made your Mouths, and given you tongues
<PB N="231" REF="108">
to speak his praise, which then are your glory;
will you profane the Name of this God, and
turn not only the glory of God, but also your
own glory into shame and dishonour, and that
when you have not the motive and incentive as
to flesh-pleasing sins? <HI>Herbert.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Take not his Name, who made thy mouth, in vain;</L>
<L>It gets thee nothing, and hath no excuse:</L>
<L>Lust and Wine plead a pleasure, Avarice gain:</L>
<L>But the cheap Swearer through his open sluce</L>
<L>Lets his soul run for nought, as little fearing:</L>
<L>Were I an <HI>Epicure,</HI> I could hate swearing.</L></Q>
<P>Look into <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. 58, 59. what threatnings
the Lord doth denounce there against such as do
not fear his Name; and surely it is for want of
fear and awe of Gods Name, that any are so bold
as to swear by it, or take it in vain: <HI>If thou wilt
not fear this glorious and fearfull Name,</HI> THE
LORD THY GOD, <HI>then the Lord will
make thy Plagues wonderfull, and the Plagues of thy
seed, even great Plagues, and of long continuance,
and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance,</HI> &amp;c.
Hath not God plagued and burned the City of
<HI>London,</HI> amongst other sins, for this of Swearing?
and yet will you swear still, and provoke the
Lord to further wrath? when you have seen in
part how fearfull the Name of God is, in the
Judgements which he hath executed, will you
go on still to profane his Name? Do you not
fear future Judgements? will not the Name of
God be displayed more dreadfully before you,
when he opens the Treasures of his wrath, and
<PB N="232" REF="109">
sends his Son in flaming Fire, to take vengeance
upon sinners, and yet will not you fear this Name
of God?</P>
<P>Swearers, with what confidence can you pray
to God? what hopes can you have when you
use Gods Name in Prayer, that you shall have
the least audience or acceptance, when you abuse
his Name so much, and cast such dishonour upon
it by your Oaths? If you do not pray now, as
Swearers seldom do, will you never be driven
to your knees? will you never be brought to
such extremities that no creature shall be able
to give you any relief? and with what face can
you then look up to God? will not your call|ings
upon the Name of God be in vain, as you
have taken his Name in vain? will not God
laugh at your Calamity, and though you cry
and shout, will not he shut out your Prayer,
and barr the door of Mercy upon you for
ever?</P>
<P>Swearers, turn from your sin; make a Cove|nant
with your mouth; set a Watch before the
dore of your lips; use Gods Name in Prayer,
and reverently in discourse; do not swear by it,
or take it in vain any more; get an awe of this
Name upon your hearts, which will be an ex|cellent
means to keep you from this sin.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Lyars, turn from your evil wayes.</HI> We read
<HI>Acts</HI> 5. at the beginning, of <HI>Annanias</HI> and <HI>Sapphi|ra,</HI>
who were smitten with sudden Death for
the sin of Lying; it is said, <HI>they fell down at the
Apostles feet, and gave up the ghost.</HI> And hath not
the sin of Lying been one ingredient in the meri|torious
Cause of the fall of so many persons and
<PB N="233" REF="109">
houses by the Plague and Fire in the City of
<HI>London?</HI> This sin of Lying, the Apostle doth in
especial caution the <HI>Colossians</HI> and <HI>Ephesians</HI> a|gainst,
after the wonderfull grace of God in the
renovation of them according to his Image,
<HI>Col. 3. 9. Lye not one to another, seeing ye have put
off the Old man with his deeds: And have put on
the New man,</HI> &amp;c. Eph. 4. 24, 25. <HI>Having put on
the New man, which after God is created in righte|ousness
and true holiness. Put away lying, and speak
every man truth to his Neighbour.</HI> And this sin I
may caution <HI>Londoners</HI> against, after the dread|ful
anger of God, expressed in the Desolations
which he hath made amongst them by his late
Judgements; Lye not one to another any more,
but speak every one Truth to his Neighbour.
The Lord is a God of truth, and he cannot lye;
do you labour to be men of truth, such as will
not lye: The Devil is the Father of Lyes, and
Lyars, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 8. 44. and which is most eligible,
to be Children of God, or Children of the Devil?
A lying tongue, is one of the seven Abominati|tions
which the Lord hateth, <HI>Prov.</HI> 6. 16, 17.
And is there any good you can get by your lying,
comparable to the evil of rendring your selves
hatefull and abominable in the sight of God? Is
it needfull for you sometimes to speak lyes? Is it
not a thousand fold more needfull for you alwayes
to speak truth? are you likely to gain so much
by the former, as by the later? what is a little
outward Emolument in comparison with inward
Peace? are you likely to lose so much by the
later, as by the former? what is the loss of ex|ternal,
temporal things, in comparison with the
<PB N="234" REF="110">
loss of your Souls and Happiness for ever? Is
it needfull to lye that you may excuse your faults?
this makes them double. <HI>Herbert.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Nothing can need a lye;</L>
<L>A fault which needs it most, grows two thereby.</L></Q>
<P>Parents, warn your Children against this sin
of Lying; do not spare the Rod of Correction
where you finde them guilty; pass by twenty
other faults rather than this; Lying is the first
link in the Chain of a thousand gross sins; rap
off their fingers from the first link, least the
Chain after grow too strong for you to
break.</P>
<P>Masters, indulge not your Servants in this sin,
the resolution of <HI>David</HI> was, <HI>Psal. 101. 7. He
that worketh deceit shall not dwell in my house; he
that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.</HI> Especial|ly
take heed of leading Servants to this sin by
your Example; above all of putting them upon
this sin, by your perswasions or commands; for,
besides the guilt of their sin which hereby you
incurr; your dammage is like to be more than
your advantage by their lyes; If you put them
upon lying for you, they will put themselves
upon lying to you; and if you deceive others
in some things by the former, they are likely to
deceive you, deservedly, in greater things by the
latter.</P>
<P>Young ones, take heed of Lyes; do nothing
as may need the cloak and excuse of a lye; and
if you be overtaken with a fault, never deny it
when examined, but with sorrow acknow|ledge
<PB N="235" REF="110">
it as you would gain favour with God and
man: Take heed of this sin betimes; lay aside
lying before it grows into a Custom, which will
be hard to leave. Old ones, break off this sin,
before you be dragg'd by the chain of this sin
into the Fire of Hell, which is the threatned pu|nishment
thereof, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21. 8. Be not too hasty
in speech, least this sin issue forth at the door of
your lips, before you are aware; speak always
as in the hearing of God, who knows whether
your words and heart do agree, and who will
one day call you to an account for this sin, and
except you repent, punish you for it severely
in the Lake of Fire and Brimstone.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Slanderers, turn from your evil wayes.</HI> The
sin of slandering is one of the worst sorts of Ly|ing;
and the <HI>teeth</HI> of slanderers are compared to
<HI>spears and arrows, and their tongue to a sharp sword,</HI>
Psal. 57. 4. and when they utter their slanders,
they <HI>bend their bowe, and shoot their arrows, they
whet their sword,</HI> and wound therewith the re|putation
of others, which they are bound to be
as carefull of as their own, <HI>Psal.</HI> 64. 34. Slande|rers
are false-witnesses, who <HI>lay to the charge of</HI>
others such <HI>things as they know not,</HI> Psal. 35. 11.
they are Lyons, who tear in pieces the good
Name of others; they are Serpents, whose words
are stings, and full of deadly poyson; they are
compared to <HI>mauls, and swords, and sharp arrows,</HI>
Prov. 25. 18. yea, they are like <HI>mad men, who
cast about fire-brands, and arrows, and death,</HI> Prov.
26. 18. By this sin, you wound others, and
are guilty of tongue-murder; but you wound
your selves more, I mean your Consciences, and
<PB N="236" REF="111">
are guilty of self-murder, of soul-murder; and
the poyson of such speeches is not so venemous
and deadly, in regard of your Neighbours good
name, as it is in regard of your own spirits,
which are invenom'd, and will be destroyed
hereby, without the application of the blood of
Christ for pardon and healing.</P>
<P>Slanderers, forbear your backbiting, slande|rous
speeches; forbear devouring words, which
swallow up the good name of your neighbours;
let not your throats be like open Sepulchres, to
entombe their Reputation: Take heed your
tongues do not utter slanders and reproaches,
devised by your selves; be carefull also that you
do not spread such Calumnies as others have de|vised.
Receive not any accusation against your
Neighbours without good proof; drive away
backbiting tongues with an angry countenance;
and if you must hear of others faults, let love
conceal them as much as may be from the know|ledge
of others; rather speak to themselves what
you hear, and reprove them, (if the things be
scandalous) with prudence, love, and a spirit of
meekness. Remember the command, <HI>Tit. 3. 2.
Speak evil of no man.</HI> And take heed of the sinfull
practice of the Women described, 1 <HI>Tim. 5. 13.
They learn to be idle, wandring about from house to
house; and not only idle, but Tatlers also, and busie|bodies,
speaking things which they ought not.</HI> Where
your tongues have been instrumental to wound
others, and your selves withall, by slanderous
speeches, make use of the same instrument for
healing; labour to heal your selves by Confession
of your sin to God, and to heal others by ac|knowledging
<PB N="237" REF="111">
to them the wrong you have done
them; labour to lick whole their fame, and by
good words to promote their esteem, which
you have unjustly taken away. Labour for so
much humility and brotherly love, as to be as
tender of their good Name and fame as your
own, and in honour to preferr them above your
selves, which will make you ready to hide their
faults, and keep you from evil furmises, and evil
slanderous speeches.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Revilers, turn from your evil wayes.</HI> Revi|ling
and slandering often go together, as pro|ceeding
both from the same root of malice and
hatred; yet sometimes the malice is kept more
close; when Warr is in the heart, and mischief
is inwardly devised, and the Name secretly
wounded with slanders behinde the back, the
tongue doth flatter, and like a Honey-comb doth
drop nothing but sweet words before the face.
The sin of Reviling is open, and spits forth ran|cour
and malice into the face, and breaks forth
into bitter speeches, for the shame and disgrace
of such persons against whom they are spoken,
though Revilers disgrace themselves more by the
weakness, and ill government of spirit, which
hereby they discover.</P>
<P>Revilers, refrain your angry bitter speeches;
<HI>Let all bitterness and wrath, and anger, and clamour,
and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all
malice,</HI> Eph. 4. 31. Do not quarrel and contend,
do not break forth into brawls and clamours,
and bitter reviling speeches, against such as give
you no occasion, but desire to live at peace with
you; and if others are angry and quarrel with
<PB N="238" REF="112">
you, labour to pacifie their anger, do not stir up
the coals by your bitter retorts; when you are
reviled, revile not again, like our Saviour, 1 <HI>Pet.
2. 23. Render not evil for evil, nor railing for
railing, but contrariwise blessing,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 9. The
second blow breeds the quarrel, and the second
reviling word breeds the strife; give to a hard
speech the return of a soft answer, Prov. 15. 1.
<HI>A soft answer turneth away wrath, but grievous
words stir up anger.</HI> And Prov. 25. 15. <HI>Long for|bearance</HI>
is of great perswasion, and <HI>a soft tongue
breaketh a bone:</HI> there is a marvelous force in a
meek reception of bitter speeches to appease an|ger,
and molifie the spirits of those which are
most fierce; whereas grievous and bitter returns
stir up unto greater contention; Revenge not
your selves with the hand, neither revenge your
selves with the tongue; revile not your enemies,
but <HI>love them,</HI> and <HI>pray for them,</HI> and <HI>do good to
them, feed</HI> and <HI>cloath them,</HI> and <HI>heap coals upon
their head,</HI> Matth. 5. 44. Rom. 12. 19, 20. <HI>Be
gentle shewing all meekness to all men,</HI> Tit. 3. 2.
especially revile not your friends, take heed of
stirring up strife in the house where you live;
be of a peaceable disposition; above all, take
heed of reviling Christs friends, Gods children;
revile not the Saints, remember that no revilers,
especially such revilers that persevere in that sin,
shall inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 10.
and when the Lord Jesus cometh at the last day,
<HI>he will execute judgement upon the ungodly, for
their hard speeches which they have spoken against
him,</HI> in speaking against his people, <HI>Iude</HI> 15.</P>
<P>Revilers govern your tongues, <HI>If any man
<PB N="239" REF="112">
among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his
tongue, that mans religion is vain,</HI> Jam. 1. 26.
would you govern your selves well according to
Scripture rules, bridle and govern your tongues,
Jam. 3. 3, 4. <HI>Behold we put bits into the Horses
mouths that they may obey us, and we turn about
their whole body. Behold also the Ships, which
though they be so great, and are driven of fierce
winds, yet they are turned about with a very small
helm, withersoever the governour listeth.</HI> Put a
bit upon this little member, and you may the
better have all the rest at command, and keep
your selves in, when otherwise vented passions
like wilde horses without rains may carry you
into many a precipice; when otherwise the fierce
storms of your minds may break forth, and
drive you upon rocks and shelves, and ship|wrack
both soul and body together. <HI>There is a
world of iniquity in the tongue, which defileth the
whole body; the tongue is a fire, which setteth on
fire the whole course of nature, and it self is set
on fire of Hell,</HI> y. 6. get the former fire quenched,
get the heat of your tongues cooled, as you
would escape the latter fire, I mean the fire of
Hell, from whence the former fire doth pro|ceed,
and unto which it will certainly bring
you. The tongue is full of deadly poison, it is
an unruly evil which no man can tame, when
by art the wildest beasts may and have been
tamed, <HI>v.</HI> 7, 8. others cannot tame your tongues,
but you may get them tamed your selves: put
them under the government of Christ, and he
will tame them, get your passions tamed with|in,
and you may tame this member which is
<PB N="240" REF="113">
the instrument that they make use of to vent
themselves in your revilings; keep guard and
sentinel before the door of your lips, and watch
your words that you offend not with your
tongues.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Persecutors turn from your evil waies:</HI> For|bear
persecuting the people of God, who desire
your good, and are the best safeguard and de|fence
by their prayers and faith of the places
where they live, from miseries and destruction;
is it good for you to hew at the bough on
which you stand, over such a deep, into which if
you should fall, it will be impossible for you to
recover your selves again? is it good for you
to pull at the Pillars of the house, which if you
pluck down, will bring the house upon you,
and bury you in its ruines? is it good to put
your selves under the burdensome stone which
will grinde you to powder? suppose whilest
you are breathing forth threatnings against any
of Christs Disciples, and are in the heat of your
rage and furious persecution of them, you should
hear such a voice as <HI>Paul</HI> did from Heaven, <HI>Sin|ners,
sinners, why persecute you me,</HI> would it not
cool, and stop you? you may hear this voice,
if you will open your ear unto the word; It is
Christ you persecute in his Disciples; it is Christ
you wound thorow their sides, you would do
the same to him as the Jews did, were he alive
amongst you, and you had the same power as
sometimes was put into their hands against the
Lord of life. I will not charge <HI>London</HI> with,
and therefore need not warn them generally
against the sin of persecution of Gods people,
<PB N="241" REF="113">
because they have been a shelter to them when
the times have frowned most upon them; but are
there none have need of this warning? are there
no <HI>Iudas</HI>'s amongst them, none of <HI>Pauls</HI> spirit
before his Conversion?</P>
<P>Persecutors forbear this sin, which makes you
as like the Devil as any that I know, and locks
you fastest in his arms; which is the very
next door to the sin against the Holy Ghost&punc;
which will bring upon you swift destruction;
which will sink you into the lowest parts of the
bottomless pit; which will lash and sting your
Consciences with horrible scourges hereafter, if
they be not awakened with horrour here; turn
from this sin before it be too late; Imitate <HI>Paul&punc;</HI>
and become friends to them against whom you
have expressed so much enmity and spight.</P>
<P>8. <HI>Covetous persons turn from your evil wayes&punc;</HI>
God hath smitten you for the iniquity of your
covetousness, do not go frowardly on in this
sin; he hath substracted much of the fuel of
this sin, and burnt it in the fire, let there be a
greater decay in your lust of Covetousness, than
there hath been in any of your estates. Cove|tousness
is one of the sins which the Apostle
would not have so much as named amongst the
Saints, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5. 3. It is a sin if it reign, which
is inconsistent with the truth of grace, and
power of Godliness, because it is Idolatry, <HI>Col.</HI>
3. 5. and the Apostle tells us expresly that Co|vetous
persons shall not inherit the Kingdom of
God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 10. yea that the wrath of God
shall come upon them, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5. 6.</P>
<P>Covetous persons turn from your sin, get
<PB N="242" REF="114">
this earthly member mortified: get your hearts
loosened from those things, which you have hi|therto
made your God, and in which you have
sought for your chiefest felicity.</P>
<P>Have you little in the world? be content|ed
with the portion which God gives you;
you have as much as God seeth fit for you,
Heb. 13. 5. <HI>Let your conversation be without co|vetousness,
and be content with such things as you
have,</HI> Covetousness may not heal your poverty
any more, than riches can heal your Cove|tousness.</P>
<P>Have you much in the world? do your
riches encrease? set not your heart upon them;
make use of what God hath given you without
such pinching and self-deniall which the Lord
Jesus never commanded in his&punc; precepts of that
kind; God never gave riches to save, but to
use; take heed of exceeding the bounds in
spending, and do not spare the moderate use
of what you have for fear of future wanting;
use part of your estates for your selves in what is
needful for the body, and sutable to your degree
and quality&punc; lay aside part for your posterity,
and lay out part in the help of those in necessity&punc;
for relief of the poor, whereby you will lay up
for your selves a good foundation for the time
to come, and at last, lay hold on eternal life&punc;
1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6. 18, 19.</P>
<P>9. <HI>Vnrighteous persons turn from your evil
wayes.</HI> God hath been righteous in his Judge|ments,
because you have been unrighteous in
your dealings; and as his Judgements are a re|proof
of your sin, so are they a warning to you
<PB N="243" REF="114">
to leave it. Unrighteous gains will yield you
little advantage in the issue: See what the Apostle
<HI>Iames</HI> speaks of the wealth which men get in
such a way, Chap. 5. 2, 3, 4. <HI>Your riches are
corrupted, and your garments Moth-eaten: Your
Gold and Silver is cankered, and the rust of them
shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your
flesh, as it were fire: ye have heaped treasure
together for the last dayes; Behold the hire of your
labourers which have reaped down your fields,
which is of you kept back by fraud, cryeth, and
the cryes have entered into the ears of the Lord
of Sabboth.</HI> The curse of God goeth along
with unlawfull, unrighteous gains; and is like
Moth and Rust to corrupt and canker them;
they bring a fire into the flesh and bones, which
will eat and torment; they pierce men thorow
with many sorrows, and at their latter end ut|terly
consume them with terrours, if their con|science
be awakened; Unrighteous persons do
not heap up such treasures of wealth, as by sin
they heap up treasures of wrath against the last
day: the wrongs, which they do to others, cry
with a loud voice to God, and the Lord will
be the avenger of all such as are defrauded.
Let them that have been unrighteous then be
unrighteous no more: you cannot wrong o|thers
so much by this sin, as you wrong your
selves; shake your hands of dishonest gains:
make restitution of what you have defrauded
others, as you expect salvation, <HI>non remittitur
peccatum, nisi restituctur ablatum.</HI> This is a hard
saying to some, who have no other wealth, but
what they have gained in a dishonest and
<PB N="244" REF="115">
unrighteous way; but will it not be harder to
suffer the vengeance of Eternal fire for this sin?
is it not better to impoverish your selves that
you may be just and honest whilest you live, than
to be damned, and thrust into a place of torment
when you die? you must leave what you have;
if God do not take away what you have by some
temporal Calamity before, be sure Death will
strip you of all; and is it not better for you to
part with it your selves to the just owners, when
this is the way to obtain pardon and peace, and
an Inheritance which is of a thousand fold more
value? And do not fear but God will make pro|vision
for you whilest you abide in the world,
if you resolve to be honest, and put your trust in
him, who hath the dispose of the Earth, and the
fulness thereof. Be righteous for the future, do
not swerve a hair from the Rule of Right;
what you would that others should do unto
you, do unto them, this is a Principle inscribed
upon the heart by Nature, and this is the Law
and the Prophets, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. 12.</P>
<P>10. <HI>Hypocrites, turn from your evil wayes.</HI> Me|thinks
the terrible voice of God should affrighten
you, under your Hypocritical showes, and out|side
Devotions: Methinks you should now bend
your hearts to please the Lord, and approve
your selves chiefly to him, who hath expressed
so much displeasure against sinners, and is most
highly offended with Hypocrites; what good
will a Form do you, without the Power of god|liness?
what good will showes do you, without
sincere and substantial service? what benefit
will you get by counterfeit Graces, if your Gra|ces
<PB N="245" REF="115">
be not reall? if your Repentance, and Faith
and Love, and the like, be feigned, how unef|fectual
will they be to procure pardon, and peace,
and salvation? are you content to lose all your
Bodily Exercise, and to have all your heartless
lifeless Duties rise up one day in Judgement a|gainst
you? What advantage will you get by a
bare Profession of Religion, especially in such
times when profession if it be strict is discounte|nanced,
and Professors if their Lamp shine with
any brightness, and they carry any great sail,
expose themselves to danger? And if you have
not Sincerity, which alone can yield you the true
and sweet fruits of Religion, you are like to lose
all, and of all others to make your selves most
miserable; you may suffer from Men, because
you have a Profession, and you will suffer from
God, because you have no more than a Profes|sion:
What then? should you cast off your Pro|fession?
No; so you would turn Apostates; and
may fall into the sin against the Holy Ghost,
which will bring upon you inevitable Damna|tion;
but lay aside your hypocrisie, and be|come
sincere; be that in truth, which you are
in show; labour for sincerity in regard of your
State, and labour for sincerity in regard of your
Duties.</P>
<P>Sinners, God calls upon all of you to turn
from your evil wayes by his thundering Voice.</P>
<P>Turn <HI>presently:</HI> let the time past be sufficient
wherein you have fulfilled the desires of the
flesh and the minde; go not a step forward in
the way of sin, least you meet with destruction
suddenly, and perish without remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="116">
Turn <HI>universally,</HI> say not of any sin, as <HI>Lot</HI> did
of <HI>Zoar, It is a little one,</HI> cast away all your
transgressions; and let no iniquity have domi|nion
over you for the future.</P>
<P>Turn <HI>heartily,</HI> from an inward Principle of
hatred to sin, and love to God, and not from
outward Considerations, and meerly upon the
account of sins dreadfull consequents.</P>
<P>Turn <HI>constantly,</HI> and with full purpose of heart
never to return unto your evil wayes of sin any
more.</P>
<P>10. The Lord doth expect after such Iudgements
that <HI>London</HI> should seek him: <HI>That they should
not only turn from their evil wayes, but also
that they should</HI> turn unto him that hath smitten
them, and seek the Lord of Hosts, <HI>Isa. 9. 13. We
read,</HI> Am. 5. 2. The Virgin of <HI>Israel</HI> is falen, she
is forsaken, and none to raise her up: <HI>whereupon
God calls to this duty,</HI> v. 4, 5, 6, 8. Thus saith
the Lord to the house of <HI>Israel,</HI> Seek ye me, and ye
shall live; but seek not <HI>Bethel,</HI> &amp;c. seek the Lord,
and ye shall live, least he break forth like fire in the
house of <HI>Joseph,</HI> and devour, and there be none to
quench; seek him who made the seven Stars, and
<HI>Orion,</HI> and turneth the shadow of death into the
morning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>LORD</HI> is his Name: and it
<HI>follows,</HI> v. 15. It may be the Lord will be gracious
unto the remnant of <HI>Joseph. And when this
Duty is neglected, see the Threatning,</HI> v. 16.
Wailing shall be in all streets, and they shall say in
all the high wayes, Alas, alas! and they shall call
the Husbandmen to mourning, and such as are skil|ful
<PB N="247" REF="116">
of lamentation, to wailing. <HI>And now</HI> Lon|don
<HI>is fallen, doth not the Lord call upon them,
that they would call upon him, and as they
would turn away his anger, and prevent their
utter ruine, that they would seek him who can
turn the shadow of death into the Morning,
and the blackest night of affliction into a day of
Prosperity and Rejoycing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>London,</HI> seek the Lord, that ye may live, that
there may be a reviving after the years of such
death and ruines; seek the Lord, before the de|cree
bring forth some other Judgement, and ye
pass away like Chaffe before the Whirlwinde, in
the day of the Lords fierce anger; it may be the
Lord will be gracious to the remnant of this
great City. God expects that <HI>London</HI> should
now pray at another rate than heretofore they
have done. It is said, <HI>Dan. 9. 13. All this evil is
come upon us, yet made we not our prayer unto the
Lord our God;</HI> and when God had consumed
<HI>Israel</HI> because of their iniquities, the Prophet
complains, Isa. 64. 7. <HI>There is none that calleth
upon thy Name, that stirreth up himself to take hold
of thee.</HI> Had the Prayers of <HI>London</HI> been such as
they should have been, such as they have been,
the Desolations of <HI>London</HI> might have been pre|vented:
God expects that <HI>London</HI> under such
Chastisements, should pour out Prayers before
him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26. 16. God hath spoken <HI>terribly</HI> unto
them, he expects that they should cry <HI>mightily</HI>
unto him. God expects that <HI>London</HI> should meet
him in the way of his Judgements, not only
with weepings for their sins, that they have pro|voked
him unto so great displeasure, but also
<PB N="248" REF="117">
with Supplications for his Mercies. When <HI>Ia|cob</HI>
was devoured, and his dwelling-place laid
waste, <HI>Psal.</HI> 79. 7. you have their prayer, <HI>v.</HI> 8, 9,
&amp;c. <HI>O Remember not against us former iniquities,
let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us, for we are
brought very low: Help us O Lord God of our sal|vation,
for the glory of thy Name: deliver us, and
purge away our sins for thy Names sake.</HI> And the
Church under desolating Judgements doth in
prayer express her self very pathetically, Isa. 63.
15, &amp;c. <HI>Look down from Heaven, and behold from
the habitation of thy holiness, and thy glory, where
is thy zeal, and thy strength, the sounding of thy
bowels, and thy mercies, are they restrained? Doubt|less,
thou art our Father,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>We are thine, return
for thy servants sake, &amp;c.</HI> and chap. 64. 9. <HI>Be not
wroth very sore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity
for ever, behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy
people.</HI> God hath been pleading and contending
with <HI>London</HI> by his Judgements, and God doth
look that <HI>London</HI> should plead with him in pray|er
for his Mercies.</P>
<P><HI>London,</HI> seek the Lord of Hosts, who hath
come forth against you in battel, and wounded
you with his sharp arrows, and yet hath not
laid down his weapons; get to your knees;
hang about Gods feet and arms; fill your
mouths with arguments to stay him in the
course of his Judgements; let not the Apple
of your eye cease from weeping, that you have
displeased him; and let not your tongue cease
from humble and earnest Entreaties, that he
would pardon you, and remove his displeasure
from you.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="117">
Seek the Lord <HI>humbly;</HI> put your mouths in
the dust, if so be there may be any hope; God
hears the Cry of the Humble, and will not de|spise
their Prayer, <HI>Psal. 10. 17. Psal.</HI> 102. 17.</P>
<P>Seek the Lord <HI>diligently:</HI> He hath promised to
be found of all them that diligently seek him,
<HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 6. God looks for earnest, hearty, fer|vent
Prayer: There is a sweet Promise which
God makes to his Peoples prayers after his sore
Judgements which he had brought upon them:
<HI>Ier. 29. 11, 12, 13. I know the thoughts, that</HI> I
<HI>think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace,
and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then
shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go, and pray unto
me, and</HI> I <HI>will hearken unto you: And ye shall seek
me and finde me, when ye shall search for me with all
your heart.</HI></P>
<P>Seek the Lord <HI>believingly;</HI> mingle your Pray|ers
with Faith, and make use of the Mediation
of Christ, that you may prevail.</P>
<P>11. <HI>God calls upon</HI> London, <HI>by the voice of his
Iudgements, to prepare for greater troubles.</HI> The
face of God seems to threaten greater troubles,
there is little sign that Gods brow is smoothened
now, more than it was before the Fire; there
is little evidence of the appeasement of Gods an|ger:
The face of the times seem to threaten
greater troubles; the Cloud over <HI>London</HI> and
<HI>England</HI> is still very black, and seems to be thicker
than it was before.</P>
<P>Gods own people are like to undergo greater
troubles: some of them have endured much, but
<PB N="250" REF="118">
they are like to endure much more; some of
them have suffered deeply, but they are like to
suffer greater things more generally: they have
been brought low by affliction, but not so low
as others be; when others of Gods people are
stript of all, they enjoy a comparative prospe|rity:
they are not so low as they deserve to be;
their Gospel-reproaching sins deserve far greater
severities: they are not so low as they may have
need to be; they may need greater troubles, to
unite them more one to another in their affecti|ons&punc;
to further their sanctification, to wean and
loosen them more from the World; to humble
them for, and purifie them more from sin; to
exercise and brighten more their graces: they
are not so low as possibly they must be before
they be exalted; the Night is the darkest before
the Day breaks; the storm is the fiercest many
times in its last blast; and the afflictions of Gods
people are the sorest before God gives them
deliverance; God layes his people most low,
when he intends their highest exaltation: sure|ly,
the expected shock is not yet over, and Gods
Peoples most dreadfull sufferings seem most im|mediately
to be threatned, they seem to be near,
very near, even at the doors. The intent of
the late Judgements by Plague and Fire, seems
plainly to be for the fitting and preparing of
them for more smart and heavy strokes. If God
had permitted those expected sufferings to have
come upon them more suddenly, they might
have found them more unready; God hath
given them time to prepare, and awakening
warnings to prepare; and when will they be
<PB N="251" REF="118">
ready to suffer like Christians, like Protestants,
if now they be not ready?</P>
<P>The Profane and wicked Generation in the
Land are like to endure greater troubles, as hath
been shown <HI>pag.</HI> 80, 81, 82. and when the storm
of Gods anger doth break down upon them,
are there no drops likely to fall upon <HI>London?</HI>
Is not the whole Land likely to be in danger of
ruine, when God doth deal with the ungodly
and wicked Crew, whom he spares for some
time, whilest he punisheth so severely the more
righteous? The troubles of <HI>London</HI> have been
great, but methinks it is evident, that <HI>London</HI>
is in danger of greater troubles; therefore they
have need to make preparation, which they
have had such awakening calls unto. Some
possibly may think the bitterness of <HI>Londons</HI>
troubles is over, because their troubles have
been so bitter; that the sharp Winter cold is
gone, when it was so sharp in the midst of
Winter, and the Sun had got to some height;
but <HI>March</HI> can bring in as cold nipping Frost,
as <HI>December</HI> and <HI>Ianuary</HI> did; and when the
Spring of Prosperity is expected by some, they
may finde the sharpest part of the Winter of
troubles to be behinde. Prepare therefore <HI>Lon|don</HI>
for greater troubles.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="119">
12. <HI>God doth expect that</HI> London <HI>should trust
no more in arms of flesh, but in himself alone.</HI>
By these Judgements God hath shown to <HI>London</HI>
the weakness and insufficiency of arms of flesh
what broken reeds they are. Some put their
trust in men, and their great expectation of re|lief
and comfort hath been from their friends;
by the Plague God hath shown, how frail and
weak man is, how like grass or a flower that
quickly withereth, or is cut down; how like
glass or a bubble which is easily broken and va|nisheth;
many have lost by the Plague their chief
friends upon whom they have had all their de|pendance,
and the Lord hath shown how insuf|ficient
a foundation man is for any ones trust
and confidence, therefore he calleth aloud to
<HI>London</HI> to <HI>cease from man, whose breath is in his
nostrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</HI> Isa.
2. 22. not to trust in <HI>any of the sons of men, in
whom there is no help;</HI> and the reason is, because
<HI>their breath goeth forth, they return to their dust, in
that very day all their thoughts perish,</HI> Psal. 146.
3, 4. Some put their trust in their wealth and
riches. Prov. 18. 11. <HI>the rich mans wealth is his
City, and a high wall in his own conceit.</HI> God
hath by the Fire, which hath consumed so much
of the wealth of the City, shown how insuffici|ent
a foundation wealth is for any mans confi|dence,
he hath made it evident that riches are
uncertain, and that they fly away with Eagles
wings, sometimes whilest the owners are look|ing
<PB N="253" REF="119">
on; may not that which is threatned, <HI>Psal.</HI>
52. 5. 7. be spoken of many in <HI>London,</HI> that
God hath rooted some of them by the Plague
out of the Land of the living, plucked and
forced others out of their habitations by the Fire,
and taken away their stay and prop from them,
of whom it may be said, Lo these are they that
made not God their strength, but trusted in the
abundance of their riches, and strengthned them|selves
in their wickedness.</P>
<P><HI>London</HI> trust no more in arms of flesh, but trust
in God alone: <HI>It is better to trust in the Lord,
than to put confidence in men; it is better to trust
in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes,</HI> Psal.
118. 8, 9. God is knocking off your fingers from
all things here below, his will is that you
should put your trust in him; which is one
promised effect of great desolations and afflicti|ons,
that you should labour after; Zeph. 3. 12.
<HI>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted,
and poor people, and they shall trust in the Name
of the Lord.</HI> You were not so forward to trust
in the Lord when you had greater abundance,
endeavour to trust in him, now you are brought
into greater poverty and affliction: his Infinite
Power, Wisdom, loving kindness, his promise,
truth and faithfulness are a strong bottome for
your trust and confidence in God. Trust in him
at all times, in the worst of times; when your
danger is greatest, he will be your help and
shield, <HI>Psal.</HI> 115. 11. he will be your refuge un|der
oppression, and present help in time of trou|ble,
<HI>Psal.</HI> 46. 1. he will be your rock and for|tress,
your high tower to defend you, or your
<PB N="254" REF="120">
deliverer to redeem you out of all your trou|bles:
trust in God alone for all things: if you
make use of creatures, do not lean and stay up|on
them, for they will slip from under you;
but stay your selves on God. O the peace and
quiet which this will yield in shaking trouble|some
dayes! when others hearts tremble within
them, and are moved like leaves upon the ap|proach
of danger, you shall not be afraid of
evil tydings, but have your hearts fixed trusting
in the Lord, <HI>Psal.</HI> 112. 7.</P>
<P>13. <HI>God doth expect that</HI> London <HI>should have
Death in continual remembrance:</HI> This God ex|pects
from the Judgement of the Plague, the
Death of so many thousands a week in <HI>London,</HI>
gave such a spectacle of Mortality, and Preached
such a Sermon in the City, as should bring the
remembrance of Death into their minds every
day of their lives; the death, if it were but of
one or two should put you in mind of your
later end; but when you have seen so many go
down into the pit before you, it should inscribe
the remembrance of death more deeply upon
your mindes, the record of which you should
look daily into: the gates of the City in the
year of the Plague seem'd to have this inscripti|on
upon them, <HI>All Flesh is Grass;</HI> Let that
word sound every day in your ears, and remem|ber
your bodies are exposed to the stroke of
death every day; and though you have out|lived
the Plague, that yet Death hath you in
the chase, and will ere long (you know not
<PB N="255" REF="120">
how soon) overtake you; remember your glass
is running, and will quickly be run out; and
therefore all the dayes of your appointed time,
as you should remember; so you should pre|pare
for your great change.</P>
<P>God expects that the remaining inhabitants
of <HI>London</HI> should be prepared well for death now,
when they have had death so much in their
view: some of you have been sick of the Plague
and brought to the very brink of the Grave,
all of you have been in danger of the Plague,
when the disease was so sore and raging:
I fear most of you were unprepared for
death at that time, and had you dyed then, that
it would have been with horrour: and I be|lieve
that there are few of you, but did in the
time of your fears and danger, make vows and
promises, if the Lord would shelter you from
the arrows, which flew about you, and spare
your lives then; that you would lead new lives,
and be more carefull to prepare for your change;
so that Death should not take you so unprovided
any more: God expects the fulfilling of your
promises; and that you should live up to the
vowes, which you made in the time of your
distress; and so provide your selves whilest you
are well, that the messenger of Death may have
a welcome reception, when ever he summoneth
you to leave this world.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="121">
14. <HI>God expects that</HI> London <HI>should retain
great impressions of Eternity.</HI> You have had the
door of Eternity set wide open in your view,
when so many were thronging in at the door,
and I believe you had deeper apprehensions of
Eternity in those dayes, than ever you had in
your lives; take heed that those impressions do
not wear off, and that you lose not those ap|prehensions,
especially when you are drawing
every day nearer and nearer thereunto. Think
often of the vast Ocean of Eternity without bot|tome
or bank on the other side, into which the
whole stream of time will empty it self; and
how quickly the small rivulet of your appointed
dayes may fall into it: Think often of the unal|terable
state of Joy or Misery, which you must
enter into at the end of your course: think how
thin and short the pleasures of sin are in this life,
in comparison of the horrible and endless tor|ments
of hell; and how light and momentane|ous
the afflictions of Gods people are here, in
comparison with the exceeding and eternal
weight of glory prepared for them in Heaven,
2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 17.</P>
<P>15. <HI>God doth call upon</HI> London <HI>by the Fire
which burnt down the City to secure themselves
against the Fire of Hell. London</HI>'s Fire was
Dreadful, but the Fire of Hell will be a thou|sand-fold
more Dreadfull. The Fire of <HI>London</HI>
was kindled by man; be sure some second cause
<PB N="257" REF="121">
was made use of herein; but the Fire of Hell
will be kindled by God himself, Isa. 30. 33.
<HI>Tophet is ordained of old, for the King it is pre|pared,
he hath made it deep and large: the pile
thereof is Fire and much Wood, and the breath of
the Lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it.</HI>
The Fire of <HI>London</HI> burnt the houses of the City,
and consumed much of the goods; but the Fire
of Hell will burn the persons of the wicked,
Matth. 15. 41. <HI>Depart ye cursed into everlasting
Fire.</HI> The Fire of <HI>London</HI> did burn most, but
not all the houses in the City, some are yet re|maining,
but the Fire of Hell will burn all the
persons of the wicked, not one of them shall
escape and remain. The Fire of <HI>London</HI> was
extinguished, and did last but four dayes; but
the Fire of Hell will be unextinguishable, it will
burn for ever, it is called everlasting Fire, in
which the damned must lye and burn eternally,
without any possibility of ever getting forth. If
you had known before of <HI>Londons</HI> Fire, where
it would begin, and how it would spread, and
seize upon your houses, surely you would have
taken some course for the prevention of it: you
know before of the Fire of Hell, the Word of
God hath revealed it; O take some course for
prevention of it, at least for securing of your
selves against it: when the Fire was burning in
<HI>London,</HI> you did fly from it, least it should have
consumed your persons as well as houses; O fly
from the Fire of Hell, into which your persons
will be thrown if you go on in sin; fly from
the wrath which is to come; fly unto Jesus
Christ who alone can deliver you.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="122">
16. <HI>God doth call upon</HI> Londoners <HI>by the Fire
to be like Strangers and Pilgrims in the World.</HI>
God hath burned you out of your habitations,
that he might loosen your affections from
houses, and riches, and all things here below;
that he might unsettle you, unhinge, unfix you,
that you might never think of Rest and Settle|ment
in the Creatures, as long as you live:
God calls upon you by this Judgement, to take
off your hearts from this world, which is so
very uncertain, and to be like Strangers and Pil|grims
upon the earth, who are to take up your
lodging here but a few dayes and nights in your
passage to the other world; God expects you
should live as those who have here no certain
dwelling place, and therefore that you should
not lavish away too much of your thoughts,
and affections, and time about these uncertain
things, which are of so short a continuance, and
with which you cannot have a long abode; God
hath by his Judgements crucified the World very
much before you, and he expects that the world
should be crucified in you; God hath poured
contempt upon the world, and set a mark of
disgrace thereon; he hath cast dirt upon the face
where you fancied before so much beauty to
lye; and he expects that you should fall in
esteem, and grow out of love with the world,
and never go a whoring from him to the crea|tures
any more.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="122">
17. <HI>God calls upon</HI> London <HI>to make him their
habitation.</HI> Psal. 90. 1. <HI>Lord thou hast been our
dwelling places in all generations.</HI> God is the hiding-place,
and he is the dwelling-place of his peo|ple;
you have lost your dwellings by the Fire,
make God your habitation, and dwell in him,
to whom you may have constant resort, and in
whom you may have a sure abode. Get possession
of this house by your union to God through his
Son; and when you are in, keep possession,
abide in this honse, do not wander from him, and
turn your selves out of doors by breaking of
his houshold laws; make God your home, and
labour to be much acquainted at home; spend
your time with God, and give your hearts to
him: Rest and repose your selves in God daily;
look for all your provisions in him, and from
him; walk in him and with him. Make God
your habitation.</P>
<P>18. <HI>God calleth upon</HI> London <HI>to seek after an
abiding City.</HI> Heb. 13. 14. <HI>We have here no con|tinuing
City, but we seek one to come. London</HI>
hath reason to say the former, therefore let <HI>Lon|don</HI>
do the later: you have seen the City fall by
the Fire, seek after a City which hath more last|ing
foundations, and is of such strong building,
that neither time can wear and weaken, nor
flames of Fire reach and consume. I mean the
<PB N="260" REF="123">
New <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which is above, the Heavenly
City, whose builder and maker is God;
there are Mansions, abiding places for the
Saints, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 14. 2. there the wicked will
cease from troubling, and the weary will be
at rest, seek: after this City, labour for a title
to it, lay up your Treasure in it, get your
affections set upon it; above all Trades drive a
Trade for Heaven, which in the issue will yield
you the best returns.</P>
<P>19. <HI>God doth expect that</HI> London <HI>should labour
to build his House.</HI> The neglect of Gods House,
I believe hath been a great cause of the fall of so
many Houses in the City by Fire. God expects
that now you should endeavour the building of
his House; otherwise, I do not think that God
will build again your Houses: you may have
an Act of Parliament for building the City, and
set Workmen about it; but unless God do enact
it too, the building will never go forward; un|less
God build the City, the Workmen will la|bour
in vain. Read and consider the Prophesie
of <HI>Haggai.</HI> Set about the work of Reformation
more vigorously; especially in the House and
Worship of God.</P>
<P>20. <HI>God doth expect that</HI> Londoners <HI>should de|dicate
themselves and Families unto him.</HI> You
have broken your Baptismal and other Vows,
<PB N="261" REF="123">
and God hath made great breaches upon you for
your Infidelity; now renew your Vows, give
up your selves to God, avouch him to be your
God, and avouch your selves to be his People,
and live accordingly: Take up <HI>Ioshuah</HI>'s reso|lution,
that whatever others in the Land do,
that you and your Families will serve the Lord:
Make it your only business in the World to
serve God; let Religion have an influence upon
all your actions; do nothing without the War|rant
of Gods Precept; let your Conversation be
such as becometh the Gospel; govern your
Families in the fear of God; fill all your Rela|tions
with duty; learn more righteousness by
Gods Judgements, and be quickned by them
unto a more holy and strict walking.</P>
<P>And if you yield such Fruits as these, which
God expects after his plowing and harrowing
of you; if you open your Ear to the Terrible
Voice of the Lord which hath uttered it self in
the City, and with full purpose of heart set
about the practice of the duties he expects and
calls for; then you may hope that he will yet
build you up and plant you, that he will close
your breaches, and raise up your ruinous Ha|bitations;
that he will make you glad accord|ing
to the Years wherein he hath afflicted
you, and give you to see good dayes, instead
of those evil which you have seen and felt;
then the Lord will rejoyce over you to do you
good; and make <HI>London</HI> like Mount <HI>Zion,</HI>
where he will pitch his Tent, and take up his
Habitation; then he will compass you about
<PB N="262" REF="124">
with the Bulwark of Salvation, and prevent
those further utterly Desolating Judgements
which you are in danger of; yea the Lord
will be as <HI>a wall of fire</HI> round about you, and
the Glory in the midst of <HI>London,</HI> from whence
his Praise and your Fame shall sound through|out
the whole World.</P>
