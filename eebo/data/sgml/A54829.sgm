<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THat what I committed the other day to the
ears of Many, I now so suddainly expose
to the eyes of All, as I dare not pretend to
deserve thy Thanks, so I conceive I cannot justly
incurr thy censure. For it is not in complyance
with my peculiar inclinations, (which of
themselves are well known to be sufficiently
<HI>averse,</HI> from any farther publication of <HI>single
Sermons,)</HI> but partly to testify my Obedience to
the commands of some Learned and pious Friends,
partly to frustrate the ill-meant whispers of some
unlearned and peevish Enemies. How farr
I was from a design either to <HI>please</HI> or to <HI>provoke</HI>
either this or that part of the Congregation, And
how probably desirous to <HI>profit both, I</HI> leave them
<HI>both</HI> to passe a Iudgement, not by any <HI>one
part,</HI> but by <HI>alltogether.</HI> It would no doubt have
been <HI>greivous</HI> to me, to suffer the contum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lies of
Men for preaching <HI>Loyalty,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Re|formation
of Life,</HI> a tender <HI>care</HI> of <HI>weak Bre|thren,</HI>
and a Christian <HI>Forbearance</HI> of <HI>one a|nother,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 5. 41.</NOTE>
if I had not thought it an happy lot, to
suffer ought for His sake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 3.</NOTE> who <HI>indur'd</HI> (for mine)
<PB REF="5">
<HI>such contradiction of sinners against himselfe;</HI>
some affirming, <HI>he was a good Man,</HI> and <HI>others
saying, Nay, but he deceiveth the People.</HI></P>
<P>If some are yet so devotedly the <HI>Servants of
Sin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 7. 12.</NOTE> as to hate me <HI>for bringing them (unawares)
into the light,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 8 34.</NOTE> because the <HI>Light hath reproved
their evill deeds,</HI> it cannot be from any <HI>hurtful|ness</HI>
either in <HI>Me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 3. 20.</NOTE> or in the <HI>light,</HI> but from their
<HI>own sore eyes,</HI> that their <HI>eyes</HI> are <HI>hurt.</HI> When Men
are <HI>exasperated</HI> with <HI>Lenitives,</HI> and throw them|selves
into <HI>Paroxysmes,</HI> after all our <HI>Pacifick</HI> and
most <HI>Anodynous applications,</HI> we ought not sure
to think the <HI>worse,</HI> but rather the <HI>better</HI> of our
Praescriptions. That Christ Himselfe <HI>could do no
miracles amongst the Men of his own Country,</HI>
was only the <HI>Fault</HI> of their <HI>prejudice,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nbeleif.</HI>
That the heat <HI>harden's clay,</HI> is from the unto|wardness
of the <HI>clay;</HI> For if it were <HI>wax, the</HI> heat
would <HI>melt</HI> it. Nor is the fault in the <HI>Sun,</HI> but in
the <HI>Dunghill,</HI> if the more he <HI>shine's</HI> on it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he worse
it <HI>smell's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> know that those <HI>Lovers</HI> of publick <HI>Discord</HI>
(whom my endeavours to <HI>reconcile</HI> have made <HI>out|ragious)</HI>
as they are <HI>few</HI> in point of <HI>Number,</HI> so
in point of <HI>Quality</HI> they are of smallest Considerati|on.
And I know there are many most worthy persons,
<PB REF="5">
whom the <HI>Virulence</HI> of mine <HI>enemies</HI> hatb made
my <HI>Friends.</HI> So that if I were studious to promote
mine <HI>own Interest,</HI> and did not very much preferr
the consideration of <HI>their Amendment,</HI> I should not
indure (as now I shall) to <HI>sue</HI> for peace whilst I
am <HI>injur'd.</HI> But still remembring what it is, to
which as Christians <HI>we are appointed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. 1 Thes. 3. 3. That no man should be moved by these afflicti|ons; for your selves know that we are appointed thereunto.</NOTE> or as Soul|diers
<HI>markt out,</HI> and that we are bound to <HI>follow
our leader,</HI> (even <HI>the Captain of our salvation
who was perfected through sufferings,)</HI> I shall
cheerfully strive to <HI>approve my self as a minister
of God,</HI> by <HI>honour and dishonour,</HI> by <HI>evill re|port,</HI>
and <HI>good report,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 2. 10.</NOTE> as a deceiver,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 6. 4. <HI>&amp;</HI> 8.</NOTE> and yet
<HI>true; I</HI> will <HI>blesse,</HI> being <HI>calumniated,</HI> And being
<HI>wrong'd above measure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4. 13. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> I will <HI>intreat.</HI> The more
it seems to be impossible, to win the <HI>inventors of
evill things</HI> to reconcileableness of Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diod. Sicul.</NOTE> the more
will <HI>I</HI> labour for its <HI>Attainment.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom, 1, 30,</NOTE> For I will never
cease to <HI>pray,</HI> that by that powerfull convincing
controuling Spirit, which <HI>stilleth the raging of the
sea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor, 1, 10,</NOTE> <HI>and the madness of the People,</HI> we may be
<HI>knit together in one mind,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph, 4. 31,</NOTE> <HI>and in one judgment;</HI>
That the present time of our <HI>prosperity</HI> may prove
the <HI>Season</HI> for our <HI>Amendment,</HI> and change of life;
that all <HI>bitternesse, and wrath, and anger, and
clamor, and evill speaking, may be put away
<PB REF="6">
from us with all malice;</HI> and that as members <HI>of
one</HI> Body, whereof Christ Iesus is the Head, we
may each of us indeavour (in our several stations)
to <HI>keep the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace.</HI></P>
<P>That this was really the intent of the Following
Sermon, the later part of the Sermon, will make
apparent. For what was spoken in reflection upon the
<HI>darknesse of the night,</HI> was only premised as a <HI>Foyl</HI>
to commend the <HI>Day.</HI> And as a thing without which
I could not make an impartial <HI>parallel</HI> between the
<HI>Text</HI> and the <HI>Time.</HI> Besides that in the method of
<HI>healing wounds,</HI> (which a flatterer may <HI>palliate,</HI>
but cannot <HI>cure,)</HI> there is as charitable an use both
of the <HI>Probe</HI> and the <HI>Abstersive,</HI> as there can possi|bly
be of the <HI>Oyl</HI> and <HI>Balsam.</HI> The <HI>Decollati|on</HI>
of <HI>Gods Anointed,</HI> (which was so farr a <HI>Dei|cide,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 82. 6.</NOTE>
as he was one of those <HI>Gods</HI> who shall <HI>dye
like men,)</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exo. 22. 28</NOTE> had been declared by the <HI>Parliament</HI>
(before I made my <HI>strictures</HI> on it) to haue been a
most <HI>horrid</HI> and <HI>hideous Murder.</HI> And if my cen|sors
did not think they had once <HI>offended,</HI> they would
not be <HI>candidates</HI> (as they are) for a Royal <HI>Pardon.</HI>
It being so naturall for a <HI>pardon</HI> to include and
connotate an <HI>offence,</HI> that unlesse we were <HI>conscious</HI>
of having <HI>sinn'd,</HI> we could not <HI>sincerely</HI> ask <HI>God
<PB REF="6">
forgivenesse.</HI> I am not able to ask any, for what I
have said in the following Sermon, tending to <HI>Loy|alty</HI>
and <HI>Union,</HI> and the <HI>establishment</HI> of <HI>both</HI>
upon the only sure <HI>Basis</HI> of impartiall <HI>Repentance</HI>
and <HI>self-revenge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 7. 11.</NOTE> untill I am able to be convinced
of <HI>Unsincerity</HI> in my <HI>ayme</HI> at so good an <HI>End,</HI> or
of unlawfullnesse in the <HI>means</HI> which I have us'd
for its <HI>attainment.</HI> And therefore that which I
begg from the <HI>Christian Reader,</HI> is not the <HI>favour</HI>
of a <HI>partiall,</HI> but the <HI>Justice</HI> of an <HI>unpassionate</HI>
and <HI>unbyassed</HI> perusall of all that follows.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ROM. XIII. xii.</BIBL>
<Q>The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us
therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let
us put on the armour of light.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO make you see how the <HI>Text</HI> is exact|ly
<HI>suitable</HI> to the <HI>Time,</HI> (as well to the
Time when 'twas <HI>written,</HI> as to the
Time wherein 'tis <HI>read,)</HI> It will be needful
to entertain you with two such <HI>Praeliminary
Observables,</HI> as without which it is impossi|ble
to come at the <HI>meaning</HI> of the <HI>words.</HI> And
yet the true <HI>meaning</HI> must be attain'd, as
well in their <HI>Rational,</HI> and <HI>Historical,</HI> as in
their <HI>Literal</HI> Importance, before I can <HI>handle</HI>
them as I <HI>ought,</HI> without <HI>injustice</HI> to the <HI>Apo|stle,</HI>
or <HI>Apply</HI> them as I <HI>desire,</HI> without <HI>de|frauding</HI>
the <HI>Congregation.</HI></P>
<P>First then, yee are to take an especial notice,
That in the space of <HI>fourty years</HI> after the
Crucifying of <HI>Iesus,</HI> there was to happen
<PB N="2" REF="8">
amongst the <HI>Iews</HI> a famous <HI>day</HI> of <HI>Discrimi|nation,</HI>
wherein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Matth. 24. 40.</NOTE> <HI>one was to be taken, and ano|ther
left.</HI> The <HI>cruel</HI> and the <HI>incredulous</HI> were
to be utterly <HI>destroy'd,</HI> But the <HI>persecuted Be|lievers</HI>
to be remarkably <HI>preserved</HI> from that
Destruction. <HI>Preserved,</HI> not only from that
<HI>deluge</HI> of Judgments, like<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Matth. 24. 38.</NOTE> <HI>Noah</HI> in the <HI>Ark,</HI> but
from the <HI>mischievous designs</HI> of the <HI>Mosaical Ze|lots,</HI>
by whom they could <HI>never</HI> be <HI>forgiven</HI> their
having been <HI>Loyal</HI> unto their <HI>Lord.</HI> Which fa|mous
<HI>day of Discrimination,</HI> as the Scriptures
have expressed in those sublimer sorts of <HI>Peri|phrasis,
[The Kingdome of Heaven, the coming of
Christ, the end of all things, and the conclusion of
the Age;]</HI> so in respect of one part, that of <HI>de|liverance
unto the Faithful,</HI> we find it expressed
in other places, by <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>The Redemp|tion
drawing neer, <GAP DESC="foreign">, The Season, <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Doctor <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mmond</HI> (of blessed memory) upon the place, and the Texts by him re|ferred to.</NOTE> The
Day, <GAP DESC="foreign">, The Deliverance,]</HI> which <HI>Delive|rance</HI>
being <HI>nearer</HI> at the writing of this <HI>Epistle,</HI>
than when they had first embraced the Chri|stian
<HI>Faith,</HI> is therefore the rather introduced
with [an <GAP DESC="foreign">,] a <HI>consideration</HI> of the <HI>time;</HI>
and that as an <HI>Argument,</HI> or <HI>Allective,</HI> whereby
to win them to the <HI>duties</HI> of this <HI>whole Chapter;</HI>
which Duties, that they concern us as we are
<PB N="3" REF="8">
men of <HI>these Times,</HI> and relating in particular
to our now happy <HI>revolution,</HI> I foresee an oc|casion
to shew anon.</P>
<P>As this is the <HI>first Praecognition,</HI> so it natu|rally
affords me an easie passage unto the <HI>se|cond.</HI>
For our Apostle having observed cer|tain
<HI>spots</HI> in the <HI>Christians</HI> which dwelt at <HI>Rome,</HI>
theie being invelloped at once with a <HI>double
darkness,</HI> as well of their <HI>doings,</HI> as of their <HI>suf|ferings,</HI>
no le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI>asleep</HI> in <HI>sin,</HI> than <HI>benighted</HI> with
<HI>Persecution,</HI> comes early to them in this <HI>Epistle;</HI>
and here endeavours to <HI>awake</HI> them, not onely
with a <HI>Call,</HI> but a <HI>Reason</HI> for it. Because the
<HI>night</HI> do's now begin to be less and less <HI>dark,</HI> he
tells them it is fit they be less and less <HI>drowzie.</HI>
In the next words before my Text, we have an
Apostolical <GAP DESC="foreign">, (the very thing that in
<HI>English</HI> we use to call the <HI>Cock-crow,)</HI> whereby
he tells the guilty <HI>sleepers,</HI> 'tis more than time
that they <HI>awake.</HI> And the <HI>Reason</HI> which he
gives them is very cogent; <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>for now
is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</HI>
That is to say in plainer terms, our <HI>delive|rance</HI>
at present is more <HI>approaching,</HI> than when
we were <HI>newly Christianiz'd.</HI> It is better with
us <HI>now,</HI> than when we were <HI>Neophytes</HI> in the
<PB N="4" REF="9">
Church. But to acquaint them the more di|stinctly
how <HI>late</HI> it is that he <HI>awakes</HI> them;
<HI>The Night</HI> (saith he) <HI>is far spent, and the Day is
at hand;</HI> (that is) the <HI>time</HI> of <HI>Persecution</HI> is <HI>now</HI>
well <HI>over,</HI> and the <HI>day of Deliverance</HI> begins to
<HI>dawn.</HI> At the Tyrant <HI>Tiberius,</HI> our <HI>Sun</HI> was
<HI>set;</HI> At the other Tyrant <HI>Nero,</HI> 'tis more than
<HI>midnight:</HI> Do but wait for <HI>Vespasian,</HI> and you
will find it <HI>break of Day.</HI></P>
<P>Nor does the <HI>vigilant</HI> Apostle meerly <HI>awake</HI>
them out of <HI>sleep,</HI> but also desires that they will
<HI>rise,</HI> and instructs them in the <HI>method</HI> how to
make themselves <HI>ready.</HI> They are to leave off
their <HI>chamber-Robes,</HI> and make them fit to go
<HI>abroad;</HI> to cast away their <HI>Bed-cloaths,</HI> as only
suitable to the <HI>Night;</HI> and to appear in such
<HI>habits,</HI> as are agreeable to the <HI>Day.</HI></P>
<Q>Let us therefore cast off the works of Darkness,
and let us put on the Armour of Light.</Q>
<P>For a man to <HI>Preach</HI> on this Text, no more
is needful than to <HI>explain</HI> it. The <HI>Text</HI> it self
being a <HI>Sermon,</HI> as <HI>full,</HI> and <HI>pithy,</HI> as it is <HI>short.
[The Night is far spent, and the Day is at hand;]</HI>
There is <GAP DESC="foreign">, the double <HI>Doctrine.</HI> [Let us
therefore <HI>cast off,</HI> and let us therefore <HI>put on;]</HI>
There is <GAP DESC="foreign">, the double <HI>Use.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9">The <HI>words,</HI> apparelling the <HI>matter,</HI> have both
<HI>number,</HI> and <HI>measure;</HI> and the <HI>matter it self</HI> is as
full of <HI>weight.</HI> From both together it is obvious
to observe <HI>three things</HI> in this mighty <HI>Preacher;</HI>
His <HI>Logick,</HI> his <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> and his <HI>Divinity.</HI></P>
<P>We have his <HI>Logick</HI> in the Illative <HI>[Therefore]</HI>
which is a note of <HI>Argumentation,</HI> giving the
<HI>force</HI> of an <HI>Enthymem,</HI> though not the <HI>form.</HI> And
yet the form is <HI>implyed</HI> with more advantage
than if <HI>exprest.</HI> The Night is far spent; <HI>There|fore</HI>
night-works and darkness must go away.
The Day is at hand; <HI>Therefore</HI> Light must be
welcome to us.</P>
<P>We have his <HI>Rhetorick</HI> in the <HI>Figures,</HI> of
which the <HI>whole</HI> is <HI>made up.</HI> For besides the
<HI>Isoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">la,</HI> and <HI>Homioteleuta</HI> of the Text, (that is)
the <HI>evenness</HI> of the <HI>Members,</HI> and Musical
<HI>Cadence</HI> of every <HI>Clause;</HI> we see the <HI>Metaphors</HI>
in the Period are just as many as the <HI>Members.</HI>
The first is borrowed from <HI>Darkness,</HI> the se|cond
from the <HI>Day;</HI> and <HI>both</HI> in <HI>Allusion</HI> to two
things more which are very distant, to wit our
<HI>Armour,</HI> and our <HI>Apparel.</HI> And yet the whole is
an <HI>Allegory,</HI> most artificially carryed on. For
as he <HI>begins</HI> his holy <HI>Trope</HI> with the <HI>night</HI> of trou|ble
and <HI>persecution,</HI> so he <HI>shuts it up too</HI> with the
<PB N="6" REF="10">
<HI>light of Peace.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In Allegori&acirc; tenendum est hoc, ut quo in gene|re incipias, eodem desi|nas, aliter consequen|tia sit tur|pissima. <HI>Quintilian.</HI></NOTE> Nay, besides all <HI>these,</HI> the Text
affords us <HI>three figures more. Three</HI> (I say in <HI>kind,</HI>
but <HI>six</HI> in <HI>number.</HI> Here is a <HI>single Anaphora,</HI> a
<HI>double Epanodos,</HI> and no less than a <HI>threefold An|tithesis,</HI>
by which the <HI>terms</HI> of the <HI>last clauses</HI>
(and there are <HI>three</HI> Terms in <HI>each)</HI> are thus op|pos'd
to one another; <HI>Darkness, to Light; Works,
to Armour;</HI> and <HI>casting off, to putting on.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Logick,</HI> and the <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> observe
the <HI>Divinity</HI> of the Apostle; to which his <HI>Art</HI>
is but the <HI>Handmaid,</HI> and made to <HI>serve.</HI> Here
is <HI>a seasonable Advertisment,</HI> and a most <HI>useful
Inference.</HI> And <HI>each</HI> of these is <HI>twofold,</HI> exactly
<HI>looking</HI> one <HI>on another,</HI> even as <HI>face answers face</HI> in
a perfect <HI>Mirroir.</HI> Observe how the <HI>later</HI> is
strongly inforc'd out of the <HI>former.</HI> Since the
<HI>night</HI> of our <HI>sufferings</HI> is now <HI>far spent,</HI> what have
we to do with the <HI>night</HI> of <HI>sin?</HI> And since the
<HI>day</HI> of our <HI>deliverance</HI> is hard <HI>at hand,</HI> what
should we do but<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vers. 13.</NOTE> <HI>walk honestly as in the day?</HI>
The <HI>night</HI> of <HI>Errour</HI> and <HI>Disorder</HI> is now well
over; <HI>Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness.</HI>
The <HI>day</HI> of <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Restauration</HI> begins to
<HI>dawn; Let us therefore put on the armour of light.</HI>
Let us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 8.</NOTE> <HI>walk</HI> in the <HI>light,</HI> as becomes <HI>children of
the light.</HI> Let our <HI>light</HI> so <HI>shine</HI> before <HI>God</HI> and
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<HI>men,</HI> that Men may <HI>see</HI> our good works, and
God <HI>reward</HI> them. That <HI>men</HI> may see our good
works, and glorify <HI>God</HI> in this <HI>present</HI> world;
that <HI>God</HI> may see our good works, and glorify
Us in the world to <HI>come.</HI> Thus we see S. <HI>Pauls
Divinity,</HI> and way of <HI>Teaching.</HI></P>
<P>It is indeed a <HI>whole Body</HI> of his <HI>practical Divi|nity,</HI>
however <HI>summ'd</HI> up in so small a <HI>System.</HI>
For the <HI>whole Duty</HI> of a <HI>Christian</HI> do's consist in
<HI>two things;</HI> first (by way of <HI>privation) in casting
off the works of Darkness, in denying ungodliness,
and worldly lusts;</HI> next (by way of <HI>Acquisition)
in putting on the armour of light; living soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world. Tit.</HI> 2.
12. For so the Apostle explains himself in the
<HI>two verses</HI> after my Text, <HI>Let us walk honestly,
as in the Day.</HI> And how must that be? first he
tells us in the <HI>Negative, Not in rioting and drun|kenness,
not in chambering and wantonness, not in
strife and envying,</HI> not in any of those things
which were yesterday forbid by his <HI>Majesties</HI>
excellent <HI>Proclamation;</HI> (for these are some of
the <HI>works of darkness,</HI> the very <HI>worst use</HI> that men
can make of a <HI>Deliverance,)</HI> next he tells us in
the <HI>Affirmative,</HI> It must be by <HI>putting on the Lord
Iesus Christ;</HI> By sticking close to his <HI>Precepts,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="11">
and taking a copy from his <HI>example;</HI> by having
a <HI>fellowship with his death,</HI> and a <HI>conformity</HI> to his
<HI>sufferings;</HI> For <HI>this</HI> is here meant by the <HI>Armour
of Light.</HI></P>
<P>And each of these is improved by <HI>three</HI> main
circumstances. First by the <HI>union</HI> of the <HI>one</HI>
with the <HI>other;</HI> they are not set with a <HI>disjun|ctive,</HI>
that we may take which we please, [Let
us cast off, Or let us put on] as if the one would
serve turn without the other; But tied together
with a <HI>copulative</HI> [Let us cast off, And let us
put on,] neither of them must go <HI>alone.</HI> We
stand obliged to do them both by indispensable
necessity; nor must we vainly flatter our selves
that Salvation is to be had upon easier terms.
Secondly by the <HI>inforcement</HI> of both <HI>together,</HI>
from the seasonable <HI>conjuncture</HI> of our <HI>affairs.</HI>
For <HI>Because</HI> the Night is far spent, we must <HI>di|vest</HI>
our selves of <HI>darkness;</HI> And <HI>Because</HI> the
Day is at hand, we must <HI>apparel</HI> our selves with
<HI>light.</HI> Thirdly by the <HI>order</HI> in which these <HI>duties</HI>
are to be <HI>done.</HI> We must not put on the Ar|mour,
<HI>Before</HI> we cast off the Works; But cease
<HI>from dishonesty</HI> in the <HI>first</HI> place, and talk of <HI>god|liness</HI>
in the <HI>second.</HI> For a <HI>godly Knave</HI> is a <HI>con|tradiction</HI>
in <HI>Adjecto.</HI> The <GAP DESC="foreign"> hath the Pre|cedency,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
we must <HI>begin</HI> with <HI>casting off</HI> what|ever
is <HI>contrary</HI> to <HI>virtue;</HI> And <HI>then</HI> comes in
the <GAP DESC="foreign">, we must <HI>proceed</HI> to the <HI>putting on</HI>
whatever is <HI>opposite</HI> to <HI>vice.</HI> We must not hope
to serve <HI>two Masters,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 6. 24.</NOTE> (which our Saviour tells
us is impossible, and which yet hath been the
project of some years past,) erecting a <HI>Church</HI>
for the <HI>one,</HI> and also a <HI>Chappel</HI> for the other;
But first of all we must abhor, and <HI>forsake</HI> our
<HI>Mammon,</HI> that so we may rationally endeavour
to <HI>cleave</HI> with <HI>stedfastness</HI> unto <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus ye see how the Text is <HI>ravell'd</HI> out
into <HI>Particulars.</HI> And were I not really some|what
afraid to spend too much of my time in
a meer <HI>Division,</HI> I would presently <HI>wind up all</HI>
into <HI>three great Bottoms.</HI> Whereof the <HI>first</HI>
would provide against <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> the <HI>second</HI>
against <HI>Indifferency,</HI> the <HI>third</HI> against <HI>fainting,</HI> as
also against <HI>Procrastination.</HI> And when <HI>Provi|sion</HI>
shall have been made for these four things,
not only <HI>Zeal,</HI> and <HI>Sincerity,</HI> but also <HI>dispatch</HI>
in our <HI>amendment,</HI> and <HI>perseverance unto the end;</HI>
I know not what can be wanting either to sa|tisfie
the <HI>Text,</HI> or to <HI>Edifie</HI> the Souls of a
<HI>Congregation.</HI></P>
<P>But before I come to handle the <HI>useful In|ference</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
of the Apostle, (which to do, will be
the business of more than <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> Sermons)
the <HI>time</HI> does prompt me to make <HI>Advantage</HI> of
his most <HI>seasonable Advertisment,</HI> out of which
he does fitly <HI>deduce</HI> his Inference. So <HI>opportune</HI>
is the <HI>Advertisment,</HI> as well to <HI>these,</HI> as <HI>those</HI>

by their happy <HI>conversion,</HI> and <HI>union</HI> with us.
For mutual <HI>love,</HI> as well as <HI>loyalty,</HI> is the thing

that <HI>We</HI> can get by it, is God's <HI>displeasure.</HI> The

the <HI>Repentance</HI> of the Nation may be <HI>impartial;</HI>
and so to our <HI>SOVERAIGNS RETURN,</HI>
there may be added his <HI>Continuance</HI> in <HI>Peace</HI> and

so long as men are <HI>well humour'd,</HI> but so long as
the <HI>Sun or the Moon endures.</HI> And then for you
of this Place, who are an honourable part of
the <HI>English</HI> Nation, That which I take to be
your <HI>Duty,</HI> I think is your <HI>Interest</HI> to indeavour.
The most I am pressing on you is <HI>this,</HI> That
ye will labour for the means of your being
<HI>happy.</HI> If ye think ye cannot be happy, <HI>with</HI> the
establishment of the <HI>Prelacy,</HI> I shall pray you
may be happy, at least <HI>without</HI> it; and also wish
I may be able to <HI>pray with Faith</HI> too. Only as
often as I reflect on <HI>King IAMES</HI> his Motto,
<HI>[No Bishop, no King,]</HI> and withal do consider
its having been <HI>verified</HI> once, and before our <HI>eyes,</HI>
I think it my duty to desire, it may <HI>not</HI> be veri|fied
<HI>any more:</HI> But that it may rather be <HI>here</HI>
applyed, what was spoken heretofore of the

<HI>Spartan Laws, [ut semper esse possent, aliquando non

they might continue to all eternity.</HI> These are sin|cerely
the very <HI>Reasons</HI> for which I insist upon
<HI>such</HI> a <HI>Subject.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly I do it in <HI>such</HI> a <HI>place,</HI> because I
look on <HI>This Assembly,</HI> as on the <HI>Head</HI> and the

<P>Having gone thus far in prosecution of the

<P>Our Apostle does not <HI>thus</HI> argue; Because

let none of us go without his share of Voluptuousness,
for this is our portion, our lot is this:</HI> I say he does
not thus reason, (like the <HI>swaggerers</HI> and <HI>Hectors</HI>
in the second <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and in the <HI>sixt</HI> of

the serious consideration of an <HI>approaching deli|verance,</HI>

<HI>Because</HI> the Night is far spent, and <HI>because</HI> the

<P>Ye know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> I told you in the beginning,

with an Increase, to bless that Increase with a
long <HI>Continuance,</HI> and so to Sanctifie unto us our

of the things <HI>Aeternal.</HI></P>
<P>This is the <HI>rational</HI> importance of the word

betwixt our <HI>Duty,</HI> and our <HI>Deliverance.</HI></P>
<P>Now that the Duty of keeping close to the
Commandments of <HI>Christ,</HI> (by casting off <HI>All</HI>
our works of Darkness, and by putting on the
<HI>whole</HI> armour of light,) should be inforced upon
our Souls from the consideration of the <HI>Time,</HI>
[a Time of <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Prosperity,</HI> succeeding a
Time of <HI>Persecution;</HI> a very bright <HI>Day,</HI> after
<PB N="31" REF="22">
a very Dark <HI>Night;]</HI> I shall the rather proceed
to prove by the several Reasons of the thing;
because the <HI>Reasons</HI> making <HI>for</HI> it, will be also
the <HI>Motives</HI> inducing <HI>to</HI> it. They will not only
clear the <HI>Truth,</HI> but advance the <HI>practice</HI> of my
Assertion.</P>
<P>The first Reason is, Because it is generous,
and noble, to <HI>amend</HI> our <HI>lives,</HI> with our <HI>conditi|ons;</HI>
and rather out of <HI>gratitude,</HI> than fordid
<HI>fear.</HI> It will be ever the greatest glory of <HI>Titus
Vespasian,</HI> (above the rest of the Roman Empe|rours)
that he was moulded by his <HI>Empire</HI> from
the <HI>worse</HI> to the <HI>better;</HI> from having been a very
cruel, and a very proud person, to be as emi|nently
<HI>mild,</HI> and <HI>humble</HI> too, as if he had listen'd
to the <HI>Precept</HI> in <HI>Ecclesiasticus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 3. 18.</NOTE> and made his
<HI>Practice</HI> an Answer to it, <HI>[My Son, the greater
thou art, humble thy self so much the more.]</HI> Happy
is the Man that can say with <HI>David, It is good
for me that I have been in trouble.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 71.</NOTE> But He is the
Man of a <HI>rarer</HI> happiness, who is <HI>inwardly</HI> the
<HI>better</HI> for having <HI>prosper'd.</HI> 'Tis very much
worthier of a <HI>Christian,</HI> to be <HI>led</HI> by Gods <HI>fa|vour,</HI>
then to be <HI>driven</HI> into duty by his <HI>severity.</HI>
A well natur'd people, upon the <HI>receiving</HI> of a
<HI>blessing,</HI> will be apt to <HI>bethink</HI> themselves, (with
<PB N="32" REF="23">
<HI>David)</HI> by what <HI>expressions</HI> of their <HI>gratitude</HI>
they may signifie their <HI>sense</HI> of their <HI>Obligation.
Quid retribuemus?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Philo <GAP DESC="foreign"> pag. 552.</NOTE> what shall we render unto the
Lord for all his benefits bestowed upon us,</HI> (Psal.

make a <HI>sacrifice</HI> to his <HI>wrath?</HI> what monstrous
<HI>sin</HI> shall we <HI>mortifie?</HI> what darling <HI>lust</HI> shall we
<HI>subdue?</HI> how shall we <HI>honour</HI> him with our
<HI>lives,</HI> and give him <HI>thanks</HI> by our <HI>Reformation?</HI>
shall we <HI>despise the Riches of his forbearance,</HI> be|cause
he is willing that his <HI>forbearance</HI> should
<HI>allure</HI> us to Repentance, and not that his <HI>Iudg|ments</HI>
should <HI>fright</HI> us to it? shall we presume
to be <HI>evil,</HI> because he is <HI>good?</HI> And <HI>offend</HI> the
more <HI>boldly,</HI> because his <HI>Grace</HI> does so much
<HI>abound?</HI> No, we will not (for <HI>shame)</HI> abuse his
<HI>Love,</HI> and corrupt our selves with his <HI>Indulgence.</HI>
Nor will we (in pity to our Souls) <HI>pollute</HI> our
selves with his <HI>gifts,</HI> or sin away his <HI>graces</HI> and
<HI>mercies</HI> to us, by making them serve to incense
his <HI>Iustice.</HI> But by how much the greater his
Mercies are, by so much the more will we
tremble to <HI>provoke the eyes of his glory.</HI> Because
we find by so late experience, He is a <HI>God ready
to pardon, swift to shew mercy,</HI> and <HI>slow to wrath;</HI>
we will indeavour to let him see, we are a peo|ple
<PB N="33" REF="23">
<HI>ready</HI> to <HI>serve</HI> him; <HI>swift</HI> to ask him <HI>for|giveness,</HI>
but <HI>slow</HI> to sin. Thus ye have the first
Reason of the word <HI>Therefore</HI> in my Text, as
'tis a particle of connexion betwixt the <HI>Duty,</HI>
and the <HI>Deliverance.</HI></P>
<P>The second <HI>Reason</HI> is, because he will other|wise
<HI>Repent</HI> of his favours to us, and will <HI>punish</HI>
us the more, for sinning against such <HI>Obligati|ons.</HI>
We ought to look upon our priviledge,
with Fear and Trembling: for that which
heightens our <HI>dignity,</HI> whilst we <HI>attend</HI> to Gods
service, does also <HI>aggravate</HI> our <HI>doom,</HI> whilst we
<HI>neglect</HI> it. The very things which make us
<HI>capable</HI> of greater <HI>happiness</HI> than others, may ac|cidentally
<HI>fit</HI> us for greater <HI>ruin.</HI> Remember
those words of our blessed Saviour, <HI>[Luk. 10. 15.]
And thou Capernaum which art lifted up to Heaven,
shalt be cast down to Hell.</HI> Whereby 'tis intima|ted
unto us, that God will punish Malefactors,
as well in respect of the <HI>mercies</HI> they have <HI>re|ceiv'd,</HI>
as in respect of the <HI>sins</HI> they have com|mitted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 5. 10.</NOTE>
When we shall all <HI>appear before the
judgment seat of God, to answer for the things
which are done in the body,</HI> we then must render
a strict accompt, what <HI>Use</HI> we have made of
our <HI>Grand deliverance,</HI> and how much we are
<PB N="34" REF="24">
the <HI>Better,</HI> for all that good that is done unto
us.</P>
<P>The third <HI>Reason</HI> is, because our <HI>dangers</HI>
are greater in time of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Prosperity,</HI> than
in time of <HI>Distress</HI> and <HI>Persecution;</HI> and so we
have need of the greater <HI>Caution. Agur</HI> pray'd
against <HI>Poverty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 30. 8, 9.</NOTE> for fear of <HI>Stealth;</HI> but he
pray'd against <HI>Riches,</HI> for fear of <HI>Atheism.</HI> If
<HI>Iesurun</HI> wax fat, he falls a <HI>kicking,</HI> and quite
<HI>forgets the God that made him. [Deut.</HI> 32. 15.] If
<HI>Nabal</HI> is drunk with the <HI>prosperity</HI> of sheering
the <HI>Innocent</HI> and harmless <HI>Sheep,</HI> it is no time to
tell him, that either <HI>David,</HI> or <HI>God</HI> is Angry.
Nay <HI>David</HI> himself, in his prosperity, began
to boast <HI>he should never be moved,</HI> [Psal. 30. 6.]
From <HI>fulness of Bread,</HI> ariseth <HI>Idleness.</HI> and
<HI>Pride;</HI> and those (we know) were the <HI>sins</HI> of
<HI>Sodom.</HI> When God rain'd <HI>Manna</HI> upon his peo|ple,
<HI>and gave them all that they desir'd,</HI> Then
[saith the Text] they <HI>were not estranged from
their lusts.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 78. 24. 25.</NOTE> But when he slew them, <HI>they sought
him, and inquired early after God.</HI> If ever any
mortal was <GAP DESC="foreign">, (that is) the <HI>White
boy</HI> of <HI>Fortune,</HI> and special favorite of the <HI>Fates,</HI>
(as the Heathens phras'd it) the Youth of <HI>Ma|cedon</HI>
was sure the Man. But though he could
<PB N="35" REF="24">
not be overcome by the <HI>strength</HI> of all <HI>Asia,</HI> he
was by the <HI>weakness,</HI> and <HI>softness</HI> of it. 'Twas
<HI>this</HI> made <HI>Cato</HI> cry out in <HI>Livy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ne illae magis res nos cepe|rint, quam nos illas. <HI>Liv.</HI> lib. 34. pag. 849.</NOTE> Quo magis impe|rium
crescit, eo plus horreo.</HI> The more our Ter|ritories
increase, the more I <HI>tremble;</HI> for fear
the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> which we have <HI>taken,</HI> do prove in|deed
to have taken <HI>Us.</HI> He knew that where
the Soul is not commensurate with the <HI>success,</HI>
the <HI>Pride</HI> arising from the Victory, does so de|file
the glory of it, that the <HI>prize</HI> may be said
to lead the <HI>Triumph</HI> into Captivity. It is so na|tural
for a man to be transported with prospe|rity,
that it extorted from <HI>Moses</HI> an extraordi|nary
<HI>caveat,</HI> before he could safely admit his
people to the delights of <HI>Canaan. When the Lord
thy God shall have brought thee into the Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 6. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE> to
give thee great and goodly Cities, and houses full of
all good things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Deut. 8. 10. to 18.</NOTE> Then beware that thou forget not the
Lord, who brought thee out of the Land of Egypt,
[Deut.</HI> 6. 10. 12.] and so again in the 8 Chapter,
<HI>When thou hast eaten, and art full, and hast built
goodly houses, and dwelt therein, Then beware least
thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy
God, who brought thee out of the house of</HI> Bondage.
'Tis a dangerous thing, to be imparadis'd on
Earth, because in every <HI>such paradise</HI> there lurks
a <HI>Serpent.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="25">The fourth <HI>Reason</HI> is, Because it is better to
have a <HI>conquering,</HI> then an <HI>untempted</HI> Innocence.
To live exactly in <HI>despight</HI> of <HI>sollicitations</HI> to the
contrary, is more <HI>thank-worthy,</HI> and more <HI>re|wardable,</HI>
than only to want the <HI>Importunity,</HI> or
<HI>Opportunity</HI> to offend. A man may easily be
<HI>submissive,</HI> whilst he is under a <HI>Persecution;</HI> and
study <HI>compliance,</HI> when he is <HI>worsted.</HI> But 'tis
as <HI>laudable,</HI> as it is <HI>difficult,</HI> if we who sought
even for <HI>Victory,</HI> whilst we were trodden <HI>under
foot,</HI> shall sue for <HI>Peace</HI> in our <HI>Prosperity.</HI> That
which makes us <HI>most high,</HI> (in the sight of God)
is our <HI>Humility;</HI> for which there is hardly any
place in our <HI>Humiliation.</HI> But the <HI>Taller</HI> any
man is, by so much the <HI>lower</HI> he hath to stoop;
and so 'tis the <HI>Benefit</HI> of <HI>success,</HI> to be <HI>Remarkable</HI>
for <HI>Modesty,</HI> and <HI>Moderation. That</HI> especially is
the <HI>season,</HI> wherein our <HI>Armour of light</HI> is of most
honourable Employment, when the <HI>Prince of
darkness</HI> hath most auxiliaries <HI>within,</HI> and our
<HI>Lusts</HI> are made <HI>ablest</HI> to <HI>War</HI> against us.</P>
<P>The fift <HI>Reason</HI> is, because there is no other
way whereby to prevail with God Almighty,
both to <HI>complete</HI> that happiness he hath begun,
and to <HI>continue</HI> it when <HI>compleated.</HI> I say to <HI>com|pleat</HI>
it being <HI>begun,</HI> because the night is <HI>far
<PB N="37" REF="25">
spent,</HI> but not <HI>quite over;</HI> The day is <HI>dawning,</HI>
or <HI>at hand,</HI> but not arriv'd at its <HI>Meridian.</HI>
God's <HI>Anointed</HI> is setled, but not his <HI>Spouse.</HI>
Many are <HI>sorry</HI> for their Sacriledge, but do not
earnestly <HI>Repent;</HI> Or they Repent a fair way,
(as far as <HI>Ahab,)</HI> but not (with <HI>Zachae</HI> the
<HI>Publican)</HI> as far as a four-fold <HI>Restitution.</HI>
Many who sinned out of <HI>Ignorance</HI> in a very
<HI>high</HI> manner, do stifly argue their being <HI>Inno|cent,</HI>
from their <HI>not apprehending</HI> that they were
<HI>guilty.</HI> But (seeing <HI>Repentance</HI> is better for
them, than a meer Temporal <HI>Impunity,)</HI> they
should be intreated to consider, and put it a
little to the question, whether their <HI>Ignorance</HI>
was not caus'd by the <HI>Previous Dominion</HI> of
some great <HI>Prejudice,</HI> which had also its <HI>Rise</HI>
from some <HI>Reigning sin.</HI> Alas! The Jews were
too <HI>guilty</HI> of <HI>killing Christ,</HI> although <HI>they knew
not what they did;</HI> for had they known him,
<HI>they would not have crucified to themselves the
Lord of Glory.</HI> But yet I say they were <HI>guil|ty,</HI>
because their <HI>Ignorance</HI> was <HI>not invincible.</HI>
It was their <HI>guilt</HI> that they were <HI>Ignorant;</HI>
they might have known what they did, had
they not stood in their <HI>own Light.</HI> If men will
either <HI>wink hard,</HI> or fling dust into their eyes,
<PB N="38" REF="26">
It is not only their <HI>Infirmity,</HI> but their <HI>fault</HI> that
they are blind. <HI>Saul</HI> the <HI>Pharisee</HI> was excused
indeed <HI>a Tanto,</HI> for having blasphem'd <HI>against
God,</HI> and also <HI>Persecuted the Church,</HI> because he
did it in <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and <HI>Unbelief.</HI> But however
it did <HI>alleviate,</HI> it did not <HI>nullifie</HI> his sins; For
to become the <HI>Apostle Paul,</HI> he stood in need
of a <HI>Conversion.</HI> Now if we do not only <HI>earnestly,</HI>
but also <HI>rationally</HI> desire to see a sutable <HI>end</HI> (or
rather <HI>no end at all)</HI> of these fair <HI>Beginnings;</HI>
that the <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Ianus</HI> may so be <HI>shut</HI> by our
<HI>Augustus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sueton. lib. 2. c. 22. p. 66.</NOTE> as <HI>never</HI> more to be open'd by any
<HI>Caesar;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Florus lib. 4. c. 12. p. 136.</NOTE> and that this <HI>Day</HI> of our <HI>Deliverance</HI>
may never more be overcast with a cloud of
darkness, but happily lost into <HI>Eternity;</HI> we
cannot better give <HI>Thanks</HI> to God for the pre|sent
<HI>breaking in</HI> of our <HI>glorious day,</HI> than by an
<HI>Annual day</HI> of <HI>Fasting</HI> for the clamorous sins of
our tedious <HI>Night.</HI> I mean the Profanation of
<HI>Holy Places;</HI> the sacrilegious perversion of
<HI>Holy Things;</HI> the <HI>monstrous Harmony</HI> of <HI>Oathes,</HI>
which some have fancied to arise from the <HI>grea|test
discord;</HI> the effusion of innocent, and (not
only so, but of) <HI>Royal Blood;</HI> with all the <HI>Pre|paratives</HI>
and <HI>Attendants</HI> of that <HI>unspeakable</HI> Pro|vocation,
which of it self does deserve (and that
<PB N="39" REF="26">
for ever) a <HI>Monthly day</HI> of <HI>Humiliation.</HI> It was
the Policy of <HI>Balaam</HI> (saith <HI>Philo</HI> the <HI>Iew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>) to
make the <HI>Moabitish Women</HI> sell the <HI>Use</HI> of their
flesh to the <HI>Hebrew Men;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo p. 501. confer. cum Num. 25. &amp; Num. 31. 16.</NOTE> and that for no o|ther
price, than their <HI>Sacrificing</HI> to <HI>Idols.</HI> As
knowing that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> were not otherwise
to be worsted, than by their own <HI>breaches</HI> of
Gods <HI>Commandments.</HI> And we know not how
soon our dawning Day may grow dark, if we
do not cast off the works of Darkness. Which
implies a good reason for the word <HI>Therefore</HI> in
the Text, as 'tis a particle of connexion be|twixt
the <HI>Duty,</HI> and the <HI>Deliverance.</HI></P>

<Q>Then beware lest thou forget the Lord, who brought
thee out of the Land of Egypt.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHen I look back upon the <HI>Church</HI> in
all her motions out of the <HI>East,</HI> ob|serving
how <HI>Monarchy</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI>
have been at once the two <HI>Shoulders</HI> to bear her
<HI>up,</HI> and withal the two <HI>Legs</HI> to bring her <HI>hither;</HI>
And when again I do reflect upon our <HI>Twenty</HI>
years <HI>sins,</HI> which were the complicated Cause
of our <HI>Twelve</HI> years <HI>sufferings;</HI> I mean our
<HI>Drunkenness</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI> which were deser|vedly
prescribed so long a <HI>Fast;</HI> the <HI>rashnesse</HI>
and <HI>vanity</HI> of our <HI>Oaths,</HI> which gave us a mi|serable
option betwixt a <HI>perjury,</HI> and an <HI>undoing;</HI>
our profanation of the <HI>Quire,</HI> which turn'd us
out of the <HI>Cathedral;</HI> our gross <HI>neglect of Gods
Service,</HI> which helpt to <HI>vote down</HI> our publick
<PB N="44" REF="29">
<HI>Liturgie;</HI> our general <HI>idleness</HI> and <HI>sloth,</HI> which
often cast us out of our Houses, and as it were
set us to eat our Bread, in the <HI>sweat</HI> of our <HI>brows,</HI>
or of our <HI>brains;</HI> our <HI>unprofitable</HI> walking under
all God's methods and means of <HI>Grace,</HI> which
left us nothing but his <HI>Iudgments</HI> (for many sad
years) to work upon us; And yet again when
I consider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 126. 4.</NOTE> <HI>How God hath turn'd our Captivity as
the Rivers of the South,</HI> and cast the Locusts out
of our Vineyards, <HI>that we may sit under our Vines;</HI>
injoying <HI>our Iudges as at the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 1. 26.</NOTE> and our Coun|sellors
as at the Beginning;</HI> And that the <HI>use</HI> we
are to make of so <HI>miraculous</HI> a <HI>Recovery,</HI> is to
be fedulous in providing against the Danger of
a <HI>Relaps;</HI> To <HI>sin no more</HI> after pardon, <HI>for fear
a worse thing happen unto us;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 5. 14.</NOTE> I think I cannot
be transported with a more <HI>Innocent Ambition,</HI>
because I cannot be <HI>ambitious</HI> of a more <HI>profitable
Attempt,</HI> than that of bringing down the <HI>Heads</HI>
of certain Hearers into their <HI>Hearts;</HI> that what
is <HI>now</HI> no more than <HI>Light,</HI> may by that means
become <HI>Fire;</HI> That we may All (in this sense)
be like the Baptist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 5. 35.</NOTE> not only <HI>shining,</HI> but <HI>burning

of Christian duties; but <HI>zealous</HI> too in the <HI>dis|charge;</HI>
as <HI>unaffectedly punctual</HI> in all our car|riage,
<PB N="45" REF="29">
as the greatest Enemies of Godliness are

of Heresies, by how much the <HI>Errour</HI> of a mans
<HI>Practice</HI> is worse than <HI>That</HI> of his bare <HI>Opinion.</HI></P>
<P>Last of all, when I consider, That though
<HI>Peace</HI> is a <HI>Blessing,</HI> and the <HI>greatest</HI> in its <HI>kind,</HI>
yet many <HI>consequences</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> are but <HI>glittering
Snares,</HI> and that the things which are given us
as <HI>helps</HI> to <HI>memory,</HI> are apt to make us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Isa. 5. 12.</NOTE> <HI>forgetful</HI>
of <HI>Him</HI> that <HI>gave</HI> them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hab. 1. 13. 16.</NOTE> I cannot think of a fit|ter

<P>When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee
into the Land, to give thee great and goodly Cities,
and houses full of all good things, when thou shalt
have eaten, and art full; <HI>THEN</HI> beware that
thou forget not the Lord, who brought thee out of the
Land of Egypt.</P>
<P>AT the very first view of which holy <HI>Caveat,</HI>
there are <HI>five</HI> particulars of Remarque
which presently meet my observation. As first,
<PB N="46" REF="30">
the <HI>Downfal</HI> of a Nation: Secondly, the <HI>De|liverance:</HI>
Thirdly, the <HI>Author</HI> of that <HI>Deli|verance:</HI>
Fourthly, the <HI>Duty</HI> by him injoyn'd:
And lastly, the <HI>Iuncture</HI> of <HI>Affairs</HI> wherein this
Duty is most in <HI>Season.</HI></P>
<P>And of all these Particulars each is the <HI>grea|test</HI>
in its kind too. For,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="I"> First behold the <HI>greatest Curse,</HI> that any poor
Nation can struggle under. A <HI>Yoke</HI> of <HI>Bondage</HI>
and <HI>Captivity,</HI> impos'd by the <HI>hardest</HI> and <HI>worst</HI>
of men. A <HI>Yoke</HI> so insupportable to some mens
<HI>Necks,</HI> that I remember <HI>Hegesistratus</HI> (a captive
Souldier in <HI>Herodotus)</HI> would rather <HI>cut off</HI> his
<HI>legs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodot. in Calliope.</NOTE> then <HI>indure</HI> his <HI>Fetters;</HI> that by the <HI>loss</HI> of
his <HI>Feet,</HI> he might be enabled to <HI>run away.</HI> So
insufferable a thing is the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Thraldome,</HI>
very significantly imply'd in the <HI>Land of Egypt,</HI>
and <HI>exegetically</HI> express'd by <HI>the house of Bondage.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"> But yet the <HI>Curse</HI> is so set, (like <HI>Shadows</HI> in
a <HI>Picture,</HI> or <HI>Foyles</HI> with <HI>Diamonds)</HI> as to com|mend
and illustrate the <HI>greatest Blessing.</HI> A <HI>De|liverance</HI>
brought about by such a miraculous
complication, that nothing but the <HI>experience</HI>
that so it is, can extenuate the <HI>wonder</HI> that so it
<HI>should</HI> be. A People groaning under the pres|sures
of several Centuries of years, and so <HI>ac|custom'd</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="30">
unto the <HI>Yoke,</HI> as to have made it a kind
of <HI>acquired Nature,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">, as <HI>Galen</HI> calls it)
<HI>De Terra Aegypti eductus est,</HI> is now at last
<HI>brought out</HI> of the Land <HI>Egypt.</HI>&mdash;And yet the
wonder begins to cease; Because</P>
<P>The <HI>Author</HI> of this Deliverance is so much <MILESTONE N="III">
the <HI>greatest</HI> to be imagin'd, that he is <HI>Dominus,
the Lord;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 40. 22.</NOTE> the Lord that <HI>stretcheth out the Hea|vens;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 104. 5.</NOTE>
the Lord that <HI>layeth the foundations of the
Earth;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zech. 12. 1.</NOTE> the Lord that <HI>formeth the spirit of Man
within him.</HI> The Lord in whose <HI>Hand</HI> are the
<HI>hearts</HI> of all men; who <HI>turneth man to Destru|ction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 90. 3.</NOTE>
and again who saith, Come again ye children
of Men</HI> In a word, It is the <HI>Lord,</HI> to whom
<HI>Miracles</HI> are <HI>natural,</HI> and by whom <HI>Impossibilities</HI>
are done with <HI>ease.</HI> 'Tis <HI>He</HI> that brought thee
out of the Land of <HI>Egypt.</HI> And therefore,</P>
<P>The <HI>Duty</HI> in proportion must be superlative|ly <MILESTONE N="IV">
<HI>great</HI> too, however hid in this place by a little
<HI>Meiosis</HI> of expression. <HI>Beware that thou forget not</HI>
the Lord thy God; that is, <HI>Remember what he
hath done,</HI> and <HI>thank</HI> him for it by thy <HI>obedience;</HI>
Let thy <HI>gratitude</HI> be <HI>seen</HI> in thy <HI>conversation.</HI> Be
sure to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Deut. 10. 12.</NOTE> <HI>love</HI> him, and to <HI>serve</HI> him, 'with <HI>all</HI> thy

which may either <HI>drown</HI> thee, or make thee
<HI>drunk,</HI> if thou are not <HI>fore-Armed</HI> with <HI>circum|spection.</HI>
And therefore <HI>Beware</HI> that thou for|get
not the Lord that brought thee out of <HI>Egypt.</HI>
And that thou mayest <HI>not forget</HI> him, write the

season of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Prosperity,</HI> succeeding a

to the <HI>Duty,</HI> should be the manifold <HI>Injoyment</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="31">
of this <HI>Deliverance.</HI> For so 'tis obvious to infer
from the particle THEN, (so strongly <HI>im|plyed</HI>
in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> that in the <HI>English</HI> 'tis well
<HI>express'd,)</HI> upon which there seems to lie the
chiefest <HI>emphasis</HI> of the Text, if we observe how
it stands in a <HI>double Relation</HI> to the <HI>Context.</HI>
[When the Lord thy God shall have brought

<P>The Text is so <HI>fruitful</HI> of particulars, and
each particular is so apt to administer <HI>matter</HI> of
<HI>Discourse,</HI> that it hath been my hardest Que|stion,
whereabouts I should <HI>begin,</HI> and how I
should <HI>end</HI> my meditations. And after too much
time lost in stating the Question within my
self, I have thought it at once the <HI>fittest</HI> and the
most <HI>useful</HI> to be resolv'd, (as most immediate|ly
complying with the <HI>solemnity</HI> of the <HI>Time,)</HI>
not to yield to the temptation of comparing

<P>First because of the <HI>Difficulty</HI> of having God

at <HI>other times.</HI> Next for the <HI>Dignity</HI> of the Duty,
rather <HI>Then,</HI> than <HI>before</HI> or <HI>after.</HI> Lastly by
reason of the <HI>Danger</HI> of not performing the
Duty <HI>Then,</HI> when it becomes incumbent on

us by many <HI>unspeakable obligations.</HI></P>
<P>These especially are the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the par|ticle

insist in this Mornings Service. For should I
adventure upon the rest, not only the <HI>hour,</HI> but
(for ought I can conjecture) the <HI>day</HI> would
fail me.</P>
<P>AND first of all let us beware, amidst the <MILESTONE N="I">
<HI>Effects</HI> of our Deliverance, that we <HI>forget</HI>
not the <HI>Author</HI> of it; because it is difficulter
THEN, than at <HI>other times.</HI> For the Flattery
and Dalliance of the world, hath perpetually
been the <HI>Mother</HI> of so much <HI>Wantonness,</HI> or
<HI>Pride,</HI> that <HI>Adam</HI> found it <HI>dangerous</HI> to be in
<HI>Paradise,</HI> yea and <HI>Lucifer</HI> to be in <HI>Heaven.</HI> Do
but look upon <HI>Solomon</HI> in the <HI>Book of Kings,</HI> and
again look upon him in his <HI>Ecclesiastes.</HI> How was
he <HI>there</HI> li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ted <HI>up</HI> by his Prosperity? and how
does he <HI>here</HI> Preach it <HI>down?</HI> I know not whe|ther,
as a <HI>Prince,</HI> he more <HI>inioy'd</HI> his Pleasures;
or, as a <HI>Prophet,</HI> more <HI>condemn'd</HI> them. Whe|ther
the <HI>luxury</HI> of his <HI>Table</HI> made him a <HI>Wanton,</HI>
or whether the <HI>vastness</HI> of his <HI>Wisdom</HI> made
him a <HI>Fool;</HI> 'Twas <HI>That</HI> betray'd him to his

(not the first in a state of <HI>sinlesness,</HI> nor the

the man <HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> that hath been ever <HI>temp|tation

on this side Heaven! and how dangerously

truly <HI>thankful,</HI> for all those wonders of <HI>salva|tion</HI>
which God hath wrought and is working
for us; the grateful commemorating of which,
is religiously the <HI>end</HI> of our present <HI>meeting.
Sweet-meats</HI> indeed are <HI>pleasant,</HI> but then they
commonly turn to <HI>choler.</HI> 'Tis sure the state of
<HI>Humiliation,</HI> which though we can <HI>worst feed
upon,</HI> we are notwithstanding <HI>best nourisht with:</HI>
we are such barren pieces of <HI>clay,</HI> that our

<HI>fruits</HI> will be <HI>wither'd</HI> with too much <HI>laughter,</HI>

he was <HI>destitute,</HI> with <HI>comfort,</HI> so he <HI>abounds,</HI>
with <HI>moderation;</HI> and that he <HI>does</HI> not live re|joycingly,
is many times a chief reason for

we may charitably pray, that God will

<P>That the pleasant <HI>effects</HI> of a Deliverance
(which are <HI>peace,</HI> and <HI>plenty,</HI> living <HI>securely,</HI> and
at <HI>ease,)</HI> are apt to make us turn <HI>Atheists,</HI> pro|voking
the <HI>Author</HI> of our Deliverance to correct
us once more in the <HI>house of Bondage;</HI> appears,
as by many other reasons, so particularly by
<HI>this;</HI> that it is hard for us to <HI>prosper,</HI> and not
to lye <HI>snoring</HI> in our prosperities. For 'tis the
<PB N="54" REF="34">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> of a <HI>prosperous man,</HI> (as our Sa|viour

much goods laid up for many years,</HI> (Luk. 12. 19.)
And therefore <HI>Agur</HI>'s <HI>wisdome</HI> was never more
seen, than in his <HI>Prayer; Give me not Riches,
lest I be full, and deny thee, lest I say, who is the
Lord?</HI> (Prov. 30. 8, 9.) He knew by manifold
experience, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jam. 4. 4.</NOTE> <HI>the friendship of the world is
perfect Enmity with God,</HI> and tends immediately
to <HI>practical,</HI> if not to <HI>speculative</HI> Atheism. He
did not therefore pray <HI>thus, Give me not Riches,</HI>
lest I be <HI>liberal</HI> to my <HI>Coffers;</HI> or, <HI>Give me not
Riches,</HI> lest I be <HI>bountiful</HI> to my <HI>Lusts;</HI> but (for
fear of a <HI>greater</HI> mischief) <HI>give me not Riches, lest I
be full, and deny thee, lest I say in my heart, who is
the Lord?</HI> that is, for fear I turn <HI>Atheist,</HI> and only

of a very <HI>vicious Prince</HI> became a <HI>Preacher of

his trials (who sure had made more trials than

them a <HI>Law,</HI> so he <HI>promis'd</HI> them a <HI>Ca|naan.</HI>

they fell a hungring after the <HI>Garlick,</HI> and the

them; like some repining at their <HI>King,</HI> as if he
were worse than a <HI>Protector,</HI> (For <HI>That,</HI> ye

the most <HI>Bloody Tyrant;)</HI> How like so

to <HI>miss</HI> of their <HI>Canaan,</HI> whilst they were taking

<P>Pass we now (if ye please) out of the <HI>Vine|yard,</HI>
into the <HI>Fold;</HI> from the <HI>People</HI> under the

though our Lord (out of <HI>goodness)</HI> was pleas'd

And this may point us out a <HI>Reason,</HI> why for

<HI>presumption;</HI> of <HI>pride,</HI> and <HI>wantonness;</HI> of <HI>for|getfulness,</HI>

either in <HI>this,</HI> or <HI>another</HI> world. And if instead
of being <HI>thankful</HI> for all the blessings we now in|joy,
more especially for <HI>That</HI> which we this day
Celebrate, we shall but <HI>turn</HI> them into <HI>wanton|ness,</HI>
and grow the <HI>worse</HI> for the <HI>effects</HI> of so

but that the <HI>powers of Hell</HI> should once
again be <HI>let loose</HI> upon <HI>us</HI> and <HI>ours?</HI> For since
to <HI>continue</HI> in our impieties, is the greatest <HI>dis|honouring</HI>
of God that can be; a <HI>filling up</HI> the
<HI>measure of our Iniquities,</HI> and so the <HI>vials</HI> of his

<P>What then remain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s, but that we take up the
<HI>Words</HI> of the Royal Prophet, and together with
<PB N="70" REF="42">
<HI>Them,</HI> his <HI>Resolution? We will take the Cup of
Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord.</HI>
The <HI>Cup of Salvation,</HI> that is to say, the <HI>Cup

<HI>wrought;</HI> as <HI>Iunius</HI> and <HI>Tremellius</HI> do rightly ex|plicate
the <HI>Trope.</HI> And mark the force of the
<HI>Copulative,</HI> by which these <HI>Duties</HI> are tyed to|gether.
Without the <HI>Cup of Salvation,</HI> (that is)
<HI>The Cup of Thanksgiving</HI> unto the <HI>Author</HI> of our
Salvation, all our <HI>calling upon his Name</HI> will be
quite <HI>in vain:</HI> For <HI>when we spread out our hands,
he will hide his eyes,</HI> and when we make many
Prayers he will <HI>not hear,</HI> (Isa. 1. 15.) And then
to <HI>thank</HI> him as he <HI>requires,</HI> is not only to en|tertain
him with <HI>Eucharistical words,</HI> with the
meer <HI>Calves of our lips,</HI> or a <HI>Doxologie</HI> from the
<HI>teeth outwards;</HI> but to <HI>imitate,</HI> and <HI>obey</HI> him, and
to <HI>love</HI> him after the <HI>rate</HI> of his <HI>favour</HI> towards
us. That we may not forfeit all our interest in
the <HI>temporal salvation</HI> we this day Celebrate, nor
bring a <HI>reproach</HI> on the <HI>Author</HI> of it, for saving a
people so ill deserving; we must add to our
<HI>verbal,</HI> our <HI>vital</HI> Prayers; nor only keep an
<HI>annual Day,</HI> but even an <HI>Age</HI> of <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> for
our <HI>Deliverance.</HI></P>
<P>And then with a greater force of Reason,
<PB N="71" REF="42">
we must <HI>beware</HI> that we <HI>forget</HI> not the Lord

(Both sufficiently express'd;) And of

and <HI>Final Cause.</HI> But in as much as the

are easily comprised in this <HI>Tricotomie.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="47">First a <HI>Terrible Commination</HI> of no less than
<HI>utter Ruin</HI> to the People of God. <HI>Sic faciam tibi</HI>

<P>Next the <HI>reasonable Ground</HI> of this <HI>Commina|tion,</HI>
which is their living <HI>unreform'd</HI> under the
Essaies and Methods of <HI>lesser Judgments.</HI> And
this I cannot but Collect from the Illative
<HI>Therefore,</HI> as it looks back upon the Causal, in
the words immediately going before. For Be|cause
<HI>Ye have not return'd unto me saith the Lord,
Idea sic faciam, Therefore thus will I do.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly the <HI>End,</HI> or the <HI>final Cause,</HI> which is

<P>These Particulars thus <HI>premis'd,</HI> will very

<P>First, That the <HI>Terrors of the Almighty</HI> do
make up one of his <HI>choicest Methods,</HI> whereby to
bring <HI>Sinners</HI> to true <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>Next that his <HI>sharper</HI> sort of <HI>Iudgments</HI> is a
fit Remedy for <HI>Those,</HI> upon whom his <HI>milder
Chastisements</HI> have been unhappily ineffectual.
And yet</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="48">Thirdly, So far is God from <HI>delighting</HI> in
his <HI>Inflictions,</HI> or from <HI>willingly grieving the Chil|dren

Destruction not on the <HI>sinner,</HI> but on the <HI>sin;</HI>

<P><MILESTONE N="I"> &sect;. 1. To begin with the First of the Pro|positions,
is not more <HI>natural</HI> to the <HI>Text,</HI> than
it is <HI>serviceable</HI> and <HI>fit</HI> to lay the Foundation of
the <HI>Sermon.</HI> For of the many strong Affecti|ons
which are seated in the Appetite and Heart
of Man, though <HI>none</HI> is certainly more <HI>Infamous,</HI>
yet (being rationally determin'd) there is not
any more <HI>Useful</HI> than that of <HI>Fear.</HI> It is in|deed
the most <HI>unhandsome,</HI> (as the World now
goes,) but being <HI>well fix'd,</HI> the most <HI>wholesome</HI>
passion; the most <HI>ungentlemanly</HI> perhaps, but
not the most <HI>unchristian</HI> Quality; And though
the worst for <HI>Execution,</HI> yet the best for <HI>Advise.</HI>
It was a very <HI>good saying,</HI> though of a very <HI>ill
man,</HI> (and meant I suppose to as <HI>ill a purpose,)
Primus in Orbe Deos fecit Timor.</HI> That had
there been less <HI>Fear,</HI> there had been also less
<HI>Religion</HI> in many Places of the World. For as
<HI>Fear</HI> was the first <HI>Engine</HI> which brought in <HI>Re|ligion</HI>
amongst the <HI>Heathens;</HI> so after the mea|sure
<PB N="84" REF="49">
that It departed, <HI>Irreligion</HI> and <HI>Atheism</HI>
fill'd up its Room. <HI>This</HI> was That that taught
the Gentiles, first to <HI>make</HI> their own Gods, and
then to <HI>Worship</HI> them. They were Religious
(poor Souls!) in their <HI>own defense,</HI> (if we may
call <HI>Superstition</HI> by such a Name,) not out of
<HI>gratitude</HI> to their Deities, for that they had don
them any <HI>Good,</HI> but only out of a <HI>Fear</HI> that they
would otherwise do them <HI>Harm.</HI> Hence the
Heathen Theologists, (I mean their <HI>Poets,</HI> and
their <HI>Philosophers,)</HI> finding the People more apt
to be <HI>driven,</HI> than <HI>led,</HI> and to have easier Im|pressions
of <HI>Fear,</HI> than <HI>Hope,</HI> thought it conve|nient
to Catechize them, more in the <HI>Torments</HI>
of their <HI>Erebus,</HI> than in the <HI>Pleasures</HI> of their
<HI>Elizium.</HI> They told them of <HI>Minos,</HI> and <HI>Rada|manthus,</HI>
as the grim <HI>Judges</HI> of <HI>Offenders;</HI> of
<HI>Haggs,</HI> and <HI>Furies,</HI> as <HI>Executioners</HI> of the <HI>Sen|tence;</HI>
of such as <HI>Ixion,</HI> and <HI>Prometheus,</HI> as sad
<HI>Examples</HI> of the <HI>Condemn'd.</HI> All which (saith
<HI>Diodorus)</HI> were but <GAP DESC="foreign">, so many <HI>Bugs,</HI>
or <HI>Mormo's,</HI> to fright the People into Morality.</P>
<P>&sect;. 2. So great an <HI>Influence</HI> had <HI>Fear</HI> on the
<HI>False</HI> Religions of the World. And to disco|ver
as great an <HI>Influx</HI> which it had also upon the
<HI>True,</HI> Let me lead you forth a little out of the
<PB N="85" REF="49">
<HI>Forrest</HI> into the <HI>Garden,</HI> wherein the very <HI>first
Precept</HI> was fens't with <HI>Terror.</HI> It was not said
unto the <HI>Protoplast, Thou shalt surely live,</HI> if
thou <HI>eatest not;</HI> But (as a method of greater
force,) <HI>In the day that thou eatest, thou shalt surely
dye.</HI> If we look into the Bible, from the Be|ginning
to the End, This we shall find to have
been the Method of <HI>each Person</HI> in the <HI>Trinity.</HI>
First of all it was the Method of <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Father,</HI>
when he deliver'd his Law from a <HI>Burning
Mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 18, 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> even with Thundering and Lightning,
with Blackness and Darkness, with smoke and
Tempest, with the sound of a Trumpet, and the
voice of words,</HI> which <HI>voice they that heard, intrea|ted
that they might not hear it, and so terrible was
the sight, that</HI> Moses <HI>said, I exceedingly fear and
quake.</HI> This again was the Method of <HI>God</HI> the
<HI>Son,</HI> who said he came not to <HI>destroy,</HI> but <HI>fulfil</HI>
the Law; his word is <GAP DESC="foreign">, to <HI>fill it up.</HI> He
did endeavour to Preach his Hearers into the
High-way of <HI>Heaven,</HI> even by setting before
them the pains of <HI>Hell.</HI> He threatn'd them
with <HI>Weeping,</HI> and <HI>Gnashing of Teeth;</HI> with <HI>a
Worm that dyeth not,</HI> and with <HI>a Fire that is not
quenched.</HI> We hear him saying, <HI>It is Impossible,</HI>
(that is to say, exceeding <HI>Hard,)</HI> for a <HI>Rich man
<PB N="86" REF="50">
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> He saith the
<HI>way</HI> to it is <HI>streight,</HI> and the <HI>Gate Narrow,</HI> and
the Travellers that find it extreamly <HI>Few.</HI> He
bids us <HI>strive</HI> to enter in; and never <HI>leave</HI> stri|ving,
until we <HI>Conquer.</HI> Nay this was the Me|thod
of the <HI>Comforter,</HI> even of <HI>God the holy Ghost;</HI>
who taught St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>constrain</HI> his Scholars,
by shewing the <HI>Terrors of the Lord.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 11.</NOTE> Nay to <HI>de|liver

of the Lord Iesus.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 3. And indeed if we consider, How many
poor Souls have been debauch'd in these <HI>Times,</HI>
by the false Apprehensions of <HI>Christian Liberty,</HI>
and <HI>Conscience,</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> without <HI>Love, Justification</HI>
without <HI>Honesty,</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI> of <HI>Sins</HI> with|out
<HI>Amendment;</HI> so as the <HI>stales</HI> of those Here|sies
which had been <HI>brew'd</HI> in ancient <HI>Times,</HI>
are freshly <HI>broach'd</HI> in our Dayes, and given
for <HI>Drink</HI> to the <HI>giddy People;</HI> we cannot but
wish that all our Clergy would now become
<HI>Boanerges,</HI> or <HI>Sons</HI> of <HI>Thunder;</HI> at least by shew|ing
the strict <HI>necessity</HI> of <HI>Impartial obedience unto
the Gospel;</HI> that is to say, unto the <HI>Statutes</HI> or

and <HI>Honesty;</HI> in the Duties of the <HI>First,</HI> and the

<P>&sect;. 4. This (we see) is so peculiar to that
Amazing <HI>Lover of Souls,</HI> that he does not only
set <HI>Hell before</HI> us, and sad <HI>Examples</HI> too <HI>behind,</HI>
but Temporal <HI>Crosses</HI> on <HI>either side.</HI> And how|ever
<HI>surrounded</HI> thus with <HI>Terrors,</HI> we find them
All <HI>little enough.</HI> For first it being not the <HI>great|ness,</HI>
but the <HI>presentness</HI> of Danger which most
<HI>affrights</HI> us; He does not <HI>threaten</HI> his Rod only,
but often <HI>layes</HI> it upon our <HI>Backs.</HI> And then
because (like common <HI>Mariners)</HI> we would not
<HI>Pray,</HI> though in a <HI>Tempest,</HI> were it impossible
to be <HI>drown'd,</HI> or to suffer <HI>Shipwrack;</HI> He does
not Punish only at <HI>present,</HI> and <HI>for a Time;</HI> But
also <HI>threatens</HI> he will do it to all <HI>Eternity.</HI> For
if after this <HI>Life</HI> is swallow'd up of <HI>Immortality,</HI>
He should only have an Heaven for <HI>Loyal</HI> Sub|jects,
and never a <HI>Hell</HI> for his <HI>Rebellious</HI> ones;
men would be readier to say, at the last period
of their lives, <HI>Let us eat and drink, for to mor|row
we dye,</HI> Than <HI>Let us fast and pray, for to

<P>&sect;. 5. If any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iduciary shall say, That
<PB N="88" REF="51">
<HI>Terrors</HI> work not a <HI>filial,</HI> but <HI>servile</HI> Fear; and
rather cause an <HI>hypocriticall,</HI> than <HI>Godly</HI> sor|row;
the Answer to it is very Easy, That as
Gods <HI>severity</HI> speaks his <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>That</HI> his
<HI>Excellence;</HI> so many times a <HI>servile Fear</HI> begets
a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Admiration;</HI> And <HI>Admiration</HI> is apt
to end in a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Reverence;</HI> and <HI>Reverence</HI> is
a <HI>Compound,</HI> which has <HI>Love,</HI> as well as <HI>Fear,</HI>
for a chief <HI>Ingredient.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 6. And if again it shall be objected, that
<HI>John</HI> and <HI>James</HI> are but <HI>uncomfortable Preachers,</HI>
enough to <HI>blast</HI> a mans <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Thunderstrike</HI>
him into <HI>Despair;</HI> I Answer to it by these de|grees.
First that for here and there <HI>one</HI> who
possibly falls into <HI>Despair,</HI> Thousands rise to
<HI>Presumption,</HI> and <HI>Millions</HI> lye down in carnal
<HI>Security.</HI> Again, The <HI>Sin</HI> of <HI>Despair</HI> is not so
commonly <HI>understood,</HI> as it is dangerously <HI>mista|ken,</HI>
and that by <HI>some</HI> who Domineer in our
open Pulpits. There is a kind of <HI>Despair,</HI> which
is only the effect of a <HI>broken heart,</HI> and the ma|nifest
sign of a <HI>tender Conscience.</HI> The mark of
such a <GAP DESC="foreign">, as is <GAP DESC="foreign">, a <HI>Repentance</HI> never
to be <HI>repented.</HI> There have been Persons in the
world, who have been so very passionately in
<HI>Love</HI> with <HI>God,</HI> and so amorous of his <HI>Purity,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="51">
that they have <HI>hated themselves</HI> extreamly, be|cause
they have suspected they have <HI>not lov'd
him;</HI> And have been easily <HI>betray'd</HI> into such
suspicion, by their <HI>sense</HI> of some things which
are <HI>unavoidable,</HI> even the natural Infirmities of
Flesh and Blood. Every small <HI>Mote</HI> in <HI>anothers</HI>
Eye hath seem'd a <HI>Beam</HI> in their <HI>own.</HI> They
have look'd upon their Sins through a kind of
<HI>Microscope,</HI> (for such is the <HI>Glass</HI> of an holy
<HI>Jealousie,)</HI> which hath made a little <HI>Ignorance</HI> to
look as bigg as an <HI>Infidelity;</HI> an <HI>human Frailty</HI> to
seem as monstrous, as an <HI>Apostacy from Grace.</HI>
Thence come those Syncopes of Spirit, by
which they are made to cry out, with Christ
Himself upon the Cross, (although 'tis quite in
another sense,) <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?</HI> An evident Argument, and sign,
not that <HI>God</HI> hath forsaken <HI>Them,</HI> but rather that
<HI>They</HI> have forsaken <HI>Sin.</HI> So when <HI>Peter</HI> cry'd
out (and even to that very Saviour on whom he
depended for his Salvation,) <HI>Depart from me</HI>
&ocirc; <HI>Lord, for I am a sinful man,]</HI> He <HI>drew</HI> Christ
<HI>to</HI> him, by his intreating him to <HI>Depart;</HI> The
more a <HI>Saint</HI> in <HI>Christs</HI> Eyes, for being a <HI>Sinner</HI>
in his <HI>own.</HI> As there are many <HI>silly Shepherds,</HI>
who mistake a <HI>Repenting</HI> for a <HI>Despairing</HI> Sheep;
<PB N="90" REF="52">
so there is oftentimes an <HI>Innocent,</HI> but <HI>silly</HI> sheep,
which mistakes his own <HI>Weakness</HI> for <HI>want</HI> of
<HI>Faith.</HI> And in as much as he does not at all
<HI>Presume,</HI> is very apt to apprehend he does not
sufficiently <HI>Believe;</HI> whereas his <HI>seemingness</HI>
of <HI>Despair</HI> is a real Argument of his <HI>Faith,</HI> whilst
attended with an hatred of <HI>former sins,</HI> and <HI>fear</HI>
of falling into the <HI>like.</HI> For whilst he thinks he
<HI>has not</HI> Faith, he does at least <HI>desire</HI> to have it.
And whilst he <HI>desires,</HI> 'tis plain he <HI>loves it.</HI> And
because of just <HI>nothing</HI> there can be <HI>no love at
all,</HI> He that <HI>loves</HI> must needs <HI>believe,</HI> that the
<HI>object</HI> of his Love has a <HI>real Being.</HI> And if he
<HI>desires</HI> what he <HI>wants,</HI> and truly loves what he
<HI>desires,</HI> and by consequence <HI>believes</HI> what he
truly <HI>loves;</HI> Then sure the sequel is unavoid|able,
That this <HI>falsifying Despair</HI> is an <HI>excellent
good mark of a True Believer.</HI> And to <HI>This</HI> alone
it is I would fain drive <HI>Others,</HI> because to <HI>This</HI>
I would fain be <HI>driven.</HI> But now the <HI>Murder|ing
Despair</HI> is another Thing, and often issues
from the Preaching of <HI>unconditional Reprobation;</HI>
when whosoever thinks himself of the <HI>Hopeless
Number,</HI> is apt to hold it so <HI>vain</HI> a Thing to
catch at an <HI>Interest</HI> in <HI>Heaven,</HI> that he resolves
to enjoy his <HI>good Things</HI> upon the <HI>Earth.</HI> And
<PB N="91" REF="52">
as nothing is so <HI>daring</HI> as a <HI>Desperate Coward,</HI>
when he finds <HI>no way</HI> to obtain his <HI>safety</HI> by his
<HI>escape,</HI> and thence is made by his <HI>Despair</HI> a most
<HI>insufferable fighter,</HI> (from whence ariseth the
common saying, That when an Enemy is <HI>flying,</HI>
'tis good to make him a <HI>Golden Bridge)</HI> so there
is nothing more <HI>jovial</HI> (at least by <HI>Intervals</HI> and
<HI>fits,)</HI> than the <HI>Desperate Sinner</HI> which now I
speak off; whose Famous Character we meet
with in the <HI>second Chapter of Wisdom;</HI> where the
<HI>Despairer</HI> of <HI>Immortality</HI> in an extreamly <HI>better</HI>
world, does make an hearty resolution of living
merrily in <HI>This.</HI> This is that <HI>desperate Despair</HI>
which is as mischievous as <HI>Presumption,</HI> in that
it placeth the <HI>sinner</HI> beyond <HI>Repentance.</HI> And
so the <HI>objection</HI> notwithstanding, my <HI>Doctrine</HI>
seems to stand firm, and unremoveable, [That
the <HI>Terrors</HI> of the Almighty do make up one of
his choicest Methods for the bringing of Sinners
to true Repentance.]</P>

<HI>proof</HI> of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> methinks our manifold
<HI>Experience</HI> should save me the Labour of <HI>Ap|plication,</HI>
whether we fall under a <HI>publick,</HI> or a

And God hath only <HI>said</HI> to <HI>Us,</HI> as to the People

<P><PB N="95" REF="54">&sect;. 1. I cannot shew you this <HI>better,</HI> than by
<HI>Example;</HI> nor by a <HI>better Example,</HI> than what
<HI>this Chapter</HI> does here afford us. For when the
<HI>Kine of Bashan</HI> on the <HI>Mountains</HI> of <HI>Samaria,</HI>
(the <HI>Schismatical Tribes</HI> of the People <HI>Israel,</HI>
whom God did therefore stigmatize with so
disgraceful a <HI>Periphrasis,)</HI> had oppress'd the
poor, and crush'd the needy, <HI>(ver.</HI> 1.) when
they had greatly <HI>transgress'd at Bethel, and mul|tiplied
Transgressions at Gilgal, (ver.</HI> 4.) God
was pleas'd to proceed against them by several
<HI>steps</HI> and <HI>degrees</HI> of his Indignation; that if a
<HI>lesser</HI> corrosive would not cure them, a <HI>sharper</HI>
might. For first he sent them <HI>cleanness of Teeth,</HI>
as his <HI>Embassadour</HI> or <HI>Herald</HI> to fetch them in.
There was <HI>a want of Bread in all their places,</HI>
which was the first part of Famine; and yet
for all this <HI>they would not return unto the Lord,
(ver.</HI> 6.) Next he Plagued them with a <HI>Drowth,</HI>
that <HI>second</HI> part of Famine; Their Sins had
made the <HI>Heavens Brass,</HI> and the <HI>Earth Iron.</HI>
So that <HI>two or three Cities</HI> were fain to <HI>wander
into one,</HI> and all <HI>to drink a little water.</HI> But yet
for all this they would not <HI>Return unto the Lord,
(ver.</HI> 8.) After this he proceeded to pour out a
Curse upon all their <HI>fruits;</HI> The <HI>fruits of their
<PB N="96" REF="55">
Gardens, and of their Vineyards,</HI> which were sud|dainly
<HI>blasted,</HI> and <HI>devour'd,</HI> partly by the <HI>Mil|dew,</HI>
and partly by the <HI>Palmer-worm.</HI> And this
(we know) was a third part of Famin; But
notwithstanding all this, <HI>They would not return
unto the Lord, (ver.</HI> 9.) Hereupon his Indignation
<HI>waxt hot</HI> against them; For seeing the <HI>Gastly
Pale Horse</HI> had been so utterly <HI>unsuccesful,</HI> He
sent the <HI>Red Horse</HI> amongst them, and that in
<HI>both</HI> parts of the dreadful <HI>Hieroglyphick;</HI> I mean
the <HI>War,</HI> and the <HI>Pestilence.</HI> And <HI>yet</HI> for all this,
<HI>They would not return unto the Lord, (ver.</HI> 10.) In
the Fifth place therefore, when neither <HI>any</HI> of
these Judgments, nor <HI>altogether,</HI> could do the
work; what remained but that the <HI>Earth</HI>
should <HI>open</HI> her <HI>Mouth,</HI> and <HI>swallow them up?</HI> or
that a <HI>Fire</HI> sent from <HI>Heaven</HI> should send them
hastily into <HI>Hell?</HI> And even of <HI>This</HI> they had a
<HI>Tast,</HI> (as appears by the verse before my Text,)
God <HI>overthrowing some of them,</HI> as he had <HI>Sodom</HI>
and <HI>Gomorrah;</HI> and the Rest were but respited,
after the manner of a <HI>Fire-brand pluckt</HI> out of
the <HI>Burning;</HI> And yet in despight of all This,
<HI>They would not return unto the Lord, (ver.</HI> 11.)
Sixtly and lastly, when so many <HI>Prelusorie
Iudgments</HI> were in effect <HI>cast away</HI> on a stubborn
<PB N="97" REF="55">
People; when all those <HI>Emisaries</HI> and <HI>Heraulds</HI>
were sent in <HI>vain;</HI> when <HI>Death it self</HI> could not
fright them, however <HI>usher'd</HI> and <HI>waited on</HI> with
so grim and formidable a <HI>Train;</HI> what could
in reason be expected but such an Absolute
<GAP DESC="foreign">, such a <HI>complete Devastation</HI> of <HI>Them,</HI> and
<HI>Theirs,</HI> as should not leave so much as a <HI>Praeco,</HI>
(no not so much as a <GAP DESC="foreign">) to carry the Ti|dings

<HI>Prayers,</HI> and <HI>Tears,</HI> the only <HI>Armour</HI> of a <HI>Chri|stian,</HI>
whereby to <HI>hold out</HI> against Omnipotence,
and the only <HI>Weapons</HI> to <HI>overcome</HI> it. We have
rather gon out to <HI>meet</HI> him, as we commonly
meet a <HI>Just Enemy;</HI> Not to ask him <HI>forgiveness,</HI>
but give him <HI>Battle.</HI> We have gon out to <HI>meet</HI>
Christ, not like Them on <HI>Palm Sunday,</HI> who
ran before him into <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> with <HI>Doxologies</HI>
and <HI>Hosannahs</HI> to the <HI>Son of David;</HI> But rather
like his first <HI>Crucifyers,</HI> with <HI>Swords and Staves

we have hitherto been in our <HI>Encounters;</HI>
Though God hath many years <HI>knockt</HI> us against
<HI>each other,</HI> and so <HI>oppos'd</HI> us unto our <HI>selves,</HI> as
that we really became no less his <HI>Host,</HI> than his

Heb. 12. 29.) And since there is hardly <HI>any

<HI>but is a spark of Gods wrath;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 5. 6, 7. Ch. XLI. ver. 29.</NOTE> Let us not by our

But</P>
<P>&sect;. 3. Let it rather be our <HI>wisdom,</HI> from this
day forewards, <HI>Venienti occurrere (non jam morbo

come too <HI>late</HI> for the <HI>prevention</HI> of the <HI>Disease,</HI>
Let us go <HI>meet</HI> our <HI>Physician,</HI> and stay the <HI>sharp|ness</HI>
of the <HI>means</HI> he is <HI>preparing</HI> for our <HI>Recovery.</HI>
We know not what <HI>Judgments</HI> may yet be ho|vering
over our <HI>Heads;</HI> and perhaps our very
<HI>Harvest</HI> may be as <HI>Terrible</HI> as our <HI>Spring.</HI> God
will not give over the <HI>Cure,</HI> till the <HI>Disease</HI> is
<HI>Desperate.</HI> For though his <HI>lesser</HI> sort of Punish|ments
did scarce <HI>incline</HI> the Heart of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI>
his <HI>last orecame it;</HI> (so far at least as to <HI>compel</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="57">
him to <HI>let the People go free.)</HI> And if his <HI>Launce</HI>
is unsuccesful, we shall be so much the surer to
feel his <HI>Caustick.</HI> But yet behold the <HI>Sun of
Righteousness</HI> breaking forth in this place like
the <HI>Sun of Nature.</HI> There is not wanting mat|ter
of <HI>comfort,</HI> in the midst of those <HI>Terrors</HI> which
have <HI>besieg'd</HI> us; Because the <HI>sharpest</HI> Judgments
<HI>here</HI> are but the <HI>Regia Medicamenta,</HI> or <HI>Magiste|rials</HI>
of our <HI>Physician;</HI> which, though by <HI>accident</HI>
they may <HI>kill,</HI> are yet <HI>intended</HI> only to <HI>cure</HI> us.
And this does lead me to consider the Third
Particular in the Division,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="III"> That God is far from delighting in his Inflictions;
He does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Chil|dren
of men. For the first and chiefest end both of
his Menaces and his stripes, is not to destroy the
sinner, but the sin; not to slay, but to reduce the
Fugitive.</P>
<P>&sect;. 1. Amongst the Reasons which may be
render'd to prove the Truth of this Doctrine,
This may certainly pass for one, That God is
never so much in <HI>Wrath,</HI> as when he will not
vouchsafe to <HI>strike.</HI> I remember <HI>Spartianus</HI> ob|serves
of <HI>Geta,</HI> (much what <HI>Tacitus</HI> of <HI>Tiberius)
Quod iis praecipue blandiretur quos ad Necem desti|nabat.</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="57">
He <HI>made so much</HI> of those persons whom
he design'd for <HI>slaughter,</HI> That his <HI>Embraces</HI> and
his <HI>best looks</HI> became more <HI>dreadful</HI> than all his
<HI>Frowns.</HI> And though 'twere Impiety but to
<HI>imagine,</HI> (what <HI>some</HI> notwithstanding have dar'd
to <HI>Preach,)</HI> that God can <HI>absolutely</HI> will the
eternal Ruin of his Creatures; much <HI>less</HI> that
He can will it, when He hath <HI>sworn</HI> he wills it
<HI>Not;</HI> much less <HI>yet</HI> that he can <HI>contrive</HI> it, by
taking care for an <HI>Impenitence</HI> to bring it <HI>orderly</HI>
about;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 16. 25.</NOTE> Yet considering how <HI>rarely</HI> 'tis given to
<HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> man, To <HI>sit</HI> with <HI>Dives</HI> at his
<HI>Table,</HI> and to <HI>lye</HI> with <HI>Lazarus</HI> in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s
<HI>Bosome;</HI> To have his Good Things <HI>here,</HI> and
<HI>hereafter</HI> too; I cannot but say of many persons
whom the <HI>World</HI> calls <HI>happy,</HI> that They who
have <HI>most</HI> of God's <HI>Bounty,</HI> may yet have <HI>least</HI>
of his <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Favour.</HI> For seeing it is True
(what the Scripture saith) That <HI>whom God
loveth he chasteneth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 6. 7, 8. and Act. 14. 22.</NOTE> and scourgeth every son whom
he receiveth;</HI> we may with good <HI>Logick</HI> infer,
That <HI>whom he chasteneth not, he doth not love; nor
receiveth any Son whom he doth not scourge.</HI> 'Twas
very shrewdly said by <HI>Solon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodot. lib. 1. pag. 14.</NOTE> (if we believe <HI>He|rodotus,)</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign">, That
the <HI>Minions</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> are but the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Prov. 1.</NOTE> <HI>sport of
<PB N="102" REF="58">
Heaven.</HI> God often <HI>lends</HI> them a kind of hap|piness,
only to shew them he does but <HI>lend</HI> it.
At once does <HI>prosper</HI> their <HI>Branches,</HI> and <HI>Curse</HI>
their <HI>Root;</HI> turns them <HI>loose</HI> into <HI>Plenty,</HI> as fit
to be <HI>fatted</HI> for the <HI>Shambles.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. But not to spend time in this Inquiry,
How hardly God's <HI>Friends</HI> can be the <HI>Favorites</HI>
of the World, or <HI>vice versa;</HI> And how by
Consequence to be <HI>pitied</HI> those Creatures are,
whom God Almighty in his <HI>Wrath</HI> permits to
<HI>wallow</HI> in <HI>superfluity;</HI> Methinks the Difference
may be This, betwixt a <HI>good</HI> man <HI>afflicted,</HI> and
an <HI>ill</HI> man <HI>prosperous,</HI> that the <HI>first</HI> does seem
to be clearly <HI>under</HI> God's Cure, and the <HI>second</HI>
to be <HI>beyond</HI> it; <HI>That</HI> indeed a <HI>Tormented,</HI> but
This a <HI>desperate</HI> Patient.</P>
<P>&sect;. 3. It is another way of proving the Infi|nite
<HI>Goodness</HI> of God's <HI>severity,</HI> in his willing|ness
to <HI>Cure</HI> whom he vouchsafes to <HI>Wound,</HI>
That he is pleased still to <HI>threaten,</HI> before he
<HI>strikes;</HI> whensoever he is an <HI>Enemy,</HI> he is <HI>de|claredly</HI>
such in his <HI>written Word.</HI> He is <GAP DESC="foreign">,
(as <HI>Aristotle</HI> calls a <HI>Generous Enemy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristot. Eth. lib. 4. cap. 8.</NOTE>)
And though his <HI>Love</HI> towards his Children may
be sometimes <HI>conceal'd,</HI> yet his <HI>Anger</HI> at their
<HI>Rebellions</HI> is still <HI>profest;</HI> and profest even to
<PB N="103" REF="58">
<HI>Them,</HI> whom he does <HI>punish</HI> with <HI>Impunity</HI> on
this side <HI>Hell.</HI> Not like <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius,</HI> those
<HI>reserv'd</HI> Enemies of <HI>Caesar,</HI> who Plotted to
Murder him in secret; But like <HI>Pompey,</HI> and
<HI>Cato,</HI> those <HI>Brave Antagonists,</HI> who bid him De|fiance
in the <HI>Field.</HI> God does <HI>tell</HI> us when He
will <HI>Arm</HI> himself, that we may stand upon our
<HI>Guard</HI> by sincere <HI>Repentance;</HI> and he does <HI>shew</HI>
us where he will <HI>strike,</HI> that we may <HI>look</HI> unto
our <HI>Posture.</HI> He <HI>Brandishes</HI> his Rod, that he
may <HI>not scourge</HI> us; and hangs his Sword over
our <HI>Eyes,</HI> that it may <HI>not</HI> fall upon our <HI>heads.</HI>
There is a Story of <HI>Diogenes,</HI> That being ask'd
what he would <HI>take</HI> to receive a <HI>Blow</HI> upon his
<HI>Head,</HI> his Answer was, He would <HI>take</HI> an <HI>Hel|met.</HI>
Now such is the Mercy of our God, that
he gives us an <HI>Helmet,</HI> before he <HI>strikes;</HI> And
when at last our <HI>Provocations</HI> have <HI>forc'd</HI> his
Sword out of his Hand, he is willinger to
<HI>drop</HI> it, than <HI>throw</HI> it down. He does not <HI>pour</HI>
out the Vials of his Displeasure <HI>all at once;</HI> but
first he dispatches his <HI>lesser</HI> punishments; and
those not as <HI>Harbingers,</HI> to <HI>prepare</HI> the way for
greater, but rather as <HI>Heralds</HI> to <HI>prevent</HI> them.
And when those <HI>greater</HI> too do follow, (I mean
the Punishments inflicted in <HI>this</HI> present life,)
<PB N="104" REF="59">
they are oftner <GAP DESC="foreign">, than <GAP DESC="foreign">, (as Philoso|phers
distinguish,) rather as <HI>motives</HI> to our

we find it to have been in the case of <HI>Zacharie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 1. 19. 20.</NOTE>
whose miraculous <HI>Iudgment</HI> was a Token of his
<HI>Pardon,</HI> as well as <HI>Sin.</HI> God indeed struck him
<HI>Dumb,</HI> but it was that ever after he might <HI>speak</HI>
so much the <HI>better,</HI> and the <HI>Privation</HI> of his <HI>Lan|guage</HI>
was to <HI>habituate</HI> his <HI>Faith.</HI> Nay I dare be
bold to say, (what yet I cannot without Asto|nishment
at the wisdom and goodness of our
Creator,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, Ploti|nus Ennead. 2. lib. 3. pag. 48.</NOTE>) that <HI>Damnation it self</HI> was at first
meant to <HI>save</HI> us, in as much as it is evident that
<HI>God</HI> made <HI>Hell,</HI> as well for the <HI>best</HI> as the <HI>worst</HI>
of men; as well for the <HI>Terror</HI> of the <HI>former,</HI>
as for the <HI>Torment</HI> of the <HI>later;</HI> as well to fright
all men from coming <HI>thither,</HI> as to punish the
Impiety of bold and desperate <HI>Intruders.</HI> Much
like the <HI>merciful severity</HI> of former <HI>Magistrates</HI>
here in <HI>England,</HI> who set up <HI>Pillaries</HI> and <HI>Gal|lowses</HI>
in publick places of the Realm, as well
to keep men from <HI>stealing,</HI> as to <HI>hang up Thieves</HI>
and <HI>Robbers;</HI> as well to <HI>prevent,</HI> as to <HI>punish</HI>
wickedness. And what a fathomless <HI>Abysse</HI> of
God's <HI>compassion</HI> must we esteem it, to set his
<HI>Bridewell</HI> before our eyes, as some say <HI>Phalaris</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="59">

that He converts our very <HI>Tempter</HI> into an

was such a <HI>Dunce,</HI> as to accelerate and further
the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> who was to dye the <HI>Propiti|ation

<HI>Hell,</HI> he spent his <HI>Malice</HI> indeed upon our
<HI>Saviour,</HI> but really the <HI>mischief</HI> was all his
<HI>Own.</HI> So that considering how the <HI>Death</HI> of our
blessed Saviour was at once a sure <HI>passage</HI> both
to <HI>His,</HI> and <HI>Our</HI> Glory, It follows that when
<HI>Iudas</HI> did <HI>kiss</HI> his <HI>Master,</HI> he only <HI>delivered</HI> up
<HI>Christ,</HI> but <HI>betray'd</HI> the <HI>Devil.</HI> Thus we find

<HI>Devil,</HI> in <HI>that</HI> case, was made <HI>Instrumental</HI> to his

were written to the Christians who dwelt at
<HI>Rome;</HI> to wit, <HI>That all things work together for
good,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 28.</NOTE> that is, <HI>to them that love God, to them that
are called according to his purpose. All</HI> that be|falls
us by God's <HI>Appointment,</HI> and the <HI>most</HI>
things that happen by God's <HI>Permission,</HI> are
strangely turn'd to our <HI>Advantage,</HI> though we
are many times so <HI>stupid,</HI> as not to be able to
<HI>apprehend</HI> it. First the <HI>evils</HI> of <HI>affliction</HI> are <HI>uni|versally</HI>
made to better us; And next, by the
<HI>Wisdom</HI> of God's <HI>Disposal,</HI> the <HI>evil</HI> of <HI>sin,</HI> in
other men, is many times of great use to <HI>secure</HI>
our <HI>Innocence.</HI> Nor have we only <HI>heard</HI> the ob|liging
Method of God's Proceedings, but I
think I may say we have <HI>felt</HI> it too. How he
first of all <HI>threatens,</HI> that he may <HI>not inflict;</HI> and
how he afterwards inflicts, that he may not
<HI>consume.</HI> How he mercifully indeavours to <HI>whip</HI>
the Sinner into a Saint; <HI>destroying</HI> the <HI>Beast</HI> in
us, to <HI>save</HI> the <HI>Man.</HI> How his <HI>Wisdom</HI> does
sometimes suffer us to be <HI>intangl'd</HI> with Temp|tations,
that so his <HI>Goodness</HI> may <HI>deliver</HI> us, and
<HI>help</HI> us <HI>out;</HI> And that we may be able to say

with <HI>David,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 75.</NOTE> Thou</HI> &ocirc; <HI>Lord of very faithfulness hast

<P>&sect;. 1. For the better <HI>Elucidation</HI> of what may
seem a <HI>dark</HI> Point, and for the <HI>prevention</HI> of such
<HI>objections</HI> as may be made by those men, who
are either so <HI>unconsidering</HI> as <HI>not</HI> to <HI>think</HI> of Gods
Methods, or so <HI>unlearned</HI> as <HI>not</HI> to <HI>know</HI> them,
or so <HI>prophane</HI> as to <HI>murmur</HI> and <HI>quarrel</HI> at them;
we shall do well to take notice of those <HI>two sorts</HI>
of Menaces, which do occur to us in Scripture
under <HI>two</HI> several <HI>Notions.</HI> Some we find under
God's <HI>Oath,</HI> and others only under his <HI>Word.</HI>
The <HI>first</HI> of which are <HI>positive,</HI> the second <HI>sup|positive.</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="61">
The <HI>former</HI> are purposed as <HI>Revenges,</HI>

Those under his <HI>Word only</HI> He does many
times <HI>Retract.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. But now it being not consistent with
the <HI>simplicity</HI> of the Almighty, that either his
<HI>Oath</HI> or his <HI>Retractation</HI> should differ really from
his <HI>Will,</HI> the Eighth Council of <HI>Toledo</HI> will give
us the Ground of this Distinction. <HI>Iurare Dei
est,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concil. Tolet. 8. cap. 2.</NOTE> <HI>&agrave; seipso ordinata nullatenus convellere; Poeni|tere
vero, eadem ordinata, cum voluerit, immutare.</HI>
When God will <HI>Execute</HI> his Sentence, he is
then said to <HI>Swear;</HI> And when he will <HI>alter,</HI> or
<HI>remit</HI> it, he is said to <HI>Repent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Poenitentia Dei nihil aliud est, qua~ simplex con|versio prioris sententiae.</NOTE> God's Repentance</HI>
(saith <HI>Tertullian) is nothing else, but a simple Re|suming

learned <HI>Philo) is nothing else but his Word exerting
it self into Effect.</HI> So that the <HI>Promises</HI> and the
<HI>Threats</HI> which are deliver'd under his <HI>Oath,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">&punc; Philo Iud. Allegor. lib. 2. pag. 75.</NOTE> are
That <HI>indeed</HI> which was but <HI>said</HI> of the <HI>now An|tiquated
Laws</HI> of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians;</HI> Irre|versible,
and peremptorie, and <HI>incapable of a
Repeal.</HI> I shall make them both plain by a few
<HI>Scriptural Examples.</HI> And</P>
<P>&sect;. 3. First of the <HI>Promises</HI> under his <HI>Oath,</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="62">
the Prophet <HI>David</HI> gives us an Instance in the
89 <HI>Psalm,</HI> at the 34 <HI>verse,</HI> where first he posi|tively
pronounceth, <HI>My Covenant will I not break,
nor alter the thing that is gon out of my lips.</HI> And
then the reason of it follows, <HI>I have sworn by
my Holiness that I will not fail David.</HI> Another
Instance of it we have in the 7. of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI>
at the 8. <HI>verse,</HI> where God is said to <HI>love Israel
more than any other Nation,</HI> even for this very
reason, and this alone, because <HI>he would make
good the Oath which he had sworn unto their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly of the <HI>Threats</HI> which God delivers
under his <HI>Oath,</HI> we have a very pregnant In|stance
in the 95 <HI>Psalm,</HI> at the 11 <HI>verse,</HI> where
speaking of the <HI>Israelites</HI> to whom the <HI>Holy Land</HI>
was <HI>promis'd,</HI> saith He, <HI>I sware in my wrath that
they should not enter into my Rest.</HI> Nor did <HI>one</HI>
of them enter, excepting <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Ioshua,</HI> who
were exempted from the Sentence, <HI>Num.</HI> 14.
30. Nay they <HI>did not</HI> enter in, though <HI>God</HI> had
<HI>sworn</HI> they <HI>should</HI> enter. From whence ariseth
an objection, How it can <HI>stand</HI> with God's
<HI>Veracity,</HI> to Swear they <HI>shall,</HI> and they <HI>shall not.</HI>
For <HI>Num. 14, 23, Surely,</HI> saith God, <HI>they shall
not see the Land which I sware unto their Fathers;</HI>
And (vers. 30.) <HI>Doubtless ye shall not come into the
<PB N="111" REF="62">
Land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell
therein.</HI> First he <HI>swore</HI> they should inhabit in
the Land, and yet afterwards He <HI>swore</HI> they
should not <HI>see</HI> it, much less should they <HI>enter,</HI>
or <HI>dwell</HI> within it. This <HI>objection</HI> seems <HI>hard,</HI>
but yet the <HI>Answer</HI> is very <HI>easie,</HI> and may be
rationally drawn from the <HI>same verse</HI> with the
<HI>objection.</HI> For the Promise was not made to the
<HI>Individuals,</HI> but to the <HI>Nation;</HI> not to the <HI>Per|sons,</HI>
but <HI>People Israel.</HI> So as <HI>both</HI> these <HI>Oaths</HI>
were most <HI>inviolately</HI> accomplished, the <HI>Nega|tive</HI>
in the <HI>Parents,</HI> and the <HI>Affirmative</HI> in their
<HI>Posterity.</HI> The <HI>Negative</HI> in the <HI>Provokers,</HI> and
the <HI>Affirmative</HI> in the <HI>Obedient.</HI> So that the
<GAP DESC="foreign">, does still stand good.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 16.</NOTE> The
<HI>Oath</HI> of God does still imply the <HI>Immutability
of his Decree,</HI> Heb. 6. 17.</P>
<P>&sect;. 4. But for the <HI>Menaces</HI> under his <HI>Word</HI>
only, the Case is different. He had much ra|ther
they should be <HI>frustrated,</HI> than severely
<HI>fulfil'd</HI> upon us. And perhaps I may say with
more propriety of speaking, that to <HI>frustrate</HI>
such Menaces is most perfectly to <HI>fulfil</HI> them.
So very signal is the <HI>Indulgence</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God,</HI>
that he will <HI>imitate</HI> and <HI>follow</HI> his very <HI>Creatures.</HI>
For no sooner can it <HI>Repent</HI> us of the <HI>evil</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="63">
which we have <HI>don,</HI> but He as suddenly repents
him of the <HI>evil</HI> of <HI>punishment</HI> which he <HI>intended.</HI>
It is his own Affirmation, <HI>Ier. 18. 8. If that
Nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from
their evil, I will repent of the evil which I thought
to do unto them.</HI> And again in the same Chapter,
<HI>Behold</HI> (saith God) <HI>I frame evil against you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 18. 11.</NOTE>
when straight it follows, <HI>Return ye every one
from the evil of his way.</HI> A fit example of this
we have, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 20. 1. where saith <HI>Isaiah</HI> to
<HI>Hezekiah,</HI> (as a Message sent from God,) <HI>Set
thy House in order, for thou shalt dye, and not live.</HI>
And yet so far he is from <HI>dying,</HI> in the <HI>fift verse</HI>
of that Chapter, that <HI>There</HI> we find tidings of his
<HI>Recovery;</HI> yea and his <HI>Lease</HI> of Life <HI>renewed</HI> for
<HI>fifteen years</HI> longer. Now the reason of it is,
because such <HI>Menaces</HI> are <HI>conditional;</HI> And <HI>con|ditio
non impleta non obligat Fidem.</HI> If it <HI>Repents</HI>
us of our <HI>sins,</HI> God Almighty is not obliged to
put <HI>such</HI> Threats in Execution, as were only
denounced on a <HI>supposal</HI> of our <HI>Impenitence.</HI>
Such was that <HI>Threat</HI> of God Almighty to
<HI>Abimelech,</HI> (for unwittingly taking the <HI>Wife</HI> of
<HI>Abraham,) Behold thou art but a dead man.</HI> But
the meaning of it follows a little after, <HI>If thou
restore her not, thou shalt surely dye. Now there|fore
<PB N="113" REF="63">
restore the man his Wife; for he is a Prophet,
and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live.</HI> Gen.
20. 3, 7. And now if any shall yet object, that
God did earnestly <HI>threaten</HI> both <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and
<HI>Abimelech,</HI> without a <HI>Proviso,</HI> or <HI>Reserve;</HI> I
shall send him for an Answer to the Rule of
Equity in <HI>Quintilian. Quaedam, etiamsi nulla
legis significatione comprehensa sunt, natura tamen
excipiuntur.</HI> The very Nature of certain words,
whether <HI>promising,</HI> or <HI>threatning,</HI> do so <HI>imply</HI> an
<HI>exception</HI> in certain <HI>cases</HI> and <HI>suppositions,</HI> that
they save the <HI>Author</HI> of them the care and la|bour
of <HI>expression.</HI> A plain <HI>Example</HI> of which
we have in the 7 <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> where
God had <HI>forbidden</HI> his People <HI>Israel</HI> to have any
<HI>Traffick</HI> or <HI>Commerce</HI> with the Neighbouring
Nations. And yet if any of those Nations
should submit to <HI>pay Tribute,</HI> and yield obedi|ence
to the <HI>Precepts</HI> which had been given down
of old to the <HI>Sons</HI> of <HI>Noah,</HI> from that very In|stant
<HI>Commerce</HI> was <HI>free.</HI> The <HI>Prohibition</HI> being
<HI>silent,</HI> where the <HI>Cause</HI> of it did <HI>cease.</HI> Nay 'tis
so absolutely impossible that any <HI>Falshood</HI> should
proceed from the <HI>Mouth</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> or that his
words should be found <HI>light</HI> in the <HI>Ballance</HI> of
the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> that we shall find them holding
<PB N="114" REF="64">
<HI>weight</HI> in our <HI>humane scales.</HI> For 'tis a Rule in
<HI>our</HI> Law, <HI>Comminationes nemini jus conferre.</HI> And
such is the Goodness of our <HI>Divine Legislator,</HI>
that though he gives us a Title to any <HI>Rewards</HI>
which he shall <HI>promise,</HI> yet he denies us all
claim to any <HI>Punishments</HI> which he shall <HI>threa|ten.</HI>
The reason is, because <HI>Promises</HI> are foun|ded
<HI>in materia favorabili,</HI> which is in Equity to
be <HI>stretch'd;</HI> But <HI>Menaces</HI> on the contrary <HI>in
materia odiosa,</HI> which by consequence is to be
<HI>streightned.</HI> For 'twas exactly said by <HI>Aristotle,</HI>
That as the proper vertue of the <HI>Intellect</HI> is
<GAP DESC="foreign">, so That of the <HI>Will</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Both</HI> im|porting
such an <HI>Equity</HI> and <HI>Equanimity</HI> in the
<HI>Iudge,</HI> (that is to say,) such a <HI>propensity</HI> towards
the <HI>right</HI> hand of <HI>Favour,</HI> as blunts and mollifies
the <HI>Edge</HI> of a <HI>Rigid Iustice.</HI> Thus it <HI>ought</HI> to be
in <HI>Man;</HI> But in <HI>God</HI> thus it <HI>Is.</HI> The <HI>Court of
Heaven</HI> hath been alwayes a kind of <HI>Chancery,</HI>
wherein he useth an <HI>Equiprudence</HI> in his <HI>judging</HI>
of the <HI>Fact,</HI> and a gracious <HI>Equity</HI> in his <HI>passing</HI>
of the <HI>Sentence.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 5. To conclude this part of my under|taking,
and to vindicate God's <HI>Veracity</HI> from
any unworthy Imputation, in the judgments
of the <HI>best,</HI> and the <HI>worst</HI> of men also, (if they
<PB N="115" REF="64">
will but deal with <HI>God,</HI> as they <HI>Themselves</HI>
would be dealt with by <HI>humane Laws,)</HI> There
are <HI>three Cases</HI> amongst <HI>Civilians,</HI> wherein all
obligations (whether by <HI>promises</HI> to <HI>Reward,</HI> or
by <HI>Menaces</HI> to <HI>Punishment,)</HI> do cease to bind.
And we shall find them all applyable to the
<HI>Doctrine</HI> or <HI>Thesis</HI> we have in hand. First I say
they cease to bind, <HI>per Cessationem rationis unicae;</HI>
to wit <HI>Impenitence.</HI> Next <HI>per Casus emergentis
Repugnantiam cum voluntate;</HI> to wit <HI>Repentance.</HI>
Then <HI>per comparationem alterius legis;</HI> to wit the
<HI>law of forgiveness</HI> to such as sincerely do <HI>Repent.</HI>
If God hath <HI>threaten'd</HI> us with <HI>Destruction</HI> upon
a supposal of our <HI>Impenitence,</HI> (which is the <HI>sole
reason</HI> for which he threatens,) And if our
<HI>Repentance</HI> shall <HI>interpose</HI> betwixt the <HI>Threat</HI> and
the <HI>Execution,</HI> (which Repentance is an <HI>Emer|gency,</HI>
to which the <HI>Will-of-God-to-punish</HI> is most
<HI>Repugnant,)</HI> Then by vertue of the <HI>Promise</HI> of
God to men, [<HI>That when soever they repent, they
shall not fail of his Pardon,</HI>] he cannot possibly
be obliged to put his <HI>Threat</HI> in <HI>Execution.</HI> For
whatsoever may have been said to a <HI>yet-sinning
People,</HI> (as once to <HI>Nineve,)</HI> yet such a People
(like the <HI>Ninevites)</HI> may seasonably <HI>break off
their sins by Righteousness,</HI> and make it <HI>just</HI> that
<PB N="116" REF="65">
the <HI>Statute</HI> should void the <HI>sentence.</HI> that is to say,
that the <HI>Statute</HI> enacting <HI>Pardon</HI> to the <HI>Penitent,</HI>
should <HI>void</HI> the <HI>sentence</HI> of <HI>Destruction</HI> which was
but made to <HI>unrepenting</HI> and <HI>desperate</HI> Sinners.</P>
<P>&sect;. 6. Now from all that hath been said of
the <HI>last observable</HI> in the Text, it is obvious to
gather this observation. That as the <HI>Impeni|tence</HI>
of the <HI>Jews</HI> did work <HI>one Miracle,</HI> in that
it <HI>hinder'd</HI> our blessed Saviour <HI>from working Mi|racles</HI>
among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 13. 58.</NOTE> which made it look like an
<HI>infeebling</HI> even of <HI>Him</HI> who was <HI>Omnipotent;</HI> so
<HI>Repentance</HI> can do a <HI>Miracle</HI> as great as <HI>That,</HI>
even <HI>change</HI> the <HI>purpose</HI> of the <HI>Immutable;</HI> and
when his <HI>Arrows</HI> are <HI>flying</HI> at us, can send them
<HI>back</HI> into their <HI>Quiver.</HI> What a kind of <HI>Almigh|tiness</HI>
hath the Almighty thus indowed <HI>Repen|tance</HI>
with? And what <HI>stratagems</HI> does he use
to <HI>induce</HI> us to it? How does he <HI>fright</HI> us to this
<HI>Duty,</HI> (after the manner in which we deal with
our little Children,) as well by slight and
<HI>empty Buggs,</HI> as by <HI>real Dangers?</HI> How does he
<HI>thunder</HI> out his <HI>Threats,</HI> as so many <HI>gracious
Equivocations,</HI> which with a blessed kind of
<HI>Fraud</HI> are meant to <HI>beguile</HI> us into <HI>Obedience?</HI>
(It is indeed a <HI>bold</HI> Metaphor, but I borrow it
from St. <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 12. 16.</NOTE> who told his <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that
<HI>being crafty, he caught them with guile.)</HI> How does
<PB N="117" REF="65">
he hold forth his <HI>Comets</HI> to a <HI>sinful Nation,</HI> very
much rather to <HI>prevent,</HI> than <HI>presage</HI> his Pla|gues?
How does he send out his <HI>Thunder,</HI> before
his <HI>Bolt?</HI> and <HI>affright</HI> us with his <HI>Lightning,</HI> that
he may not <HI>consume</HI> us with his <HI>Fire?</HI> How did
he <HI>scare</HI> us very lately with <HI>Gluts</HI> of <HI>Rain,</HI> that
he might not destroy us with <HI>perfect Famine?</HI> I
pray contemplate on my <HI>Text,</HI> a little more
<HI>attently</HI> before I leave it, and ye will find how
exactly it is conformable to the <HI>Time.</HI> What
<HI>Beams</HI> of <HI>Mercy</HI> may we <HI>descry,</HI> most sweetly
<HI>breaking forth</HI> from a <HI>Cloud of Justice?</HI> How does
his <HI>Pity</HI> in a manner give a <HI>Counter-check</HI> to his
<HI>wrath?</HI> whilst he says in his <HI>Anger, Thus and
thus will I do;</HI> his <HI>Loving kindness</HI> interposeth,
<HI>Prepare to meet thy God</HI> &ocirc; Israel. <HI>Thus will I do,</HI>
to <HI>destroy</HI> the <HI>Sin;</HI> but <HI>prepare to meet me,</HI> to the
end that I may <HI>not destroy</HI> the <HI>sinner.</HI> 'Tis true
we read that when <HI>Adrastes</HI> had <HI>kill'd</HI> the <HI>Son</HI>
of King <HI>Croesus, Croesus</HI> was so <HI>touch'd</HI> with that
very <HI>Murderer's Humiliation,</HI> as at that very
time to pronounce his <HI>Pardon.</HI> A Temper (ye
will say) in an <HI>Heathen Prince,</HI> which the grea|test
part of Christians would <HI>admire</HI> sooner than
<HI>imitate.</HI> But how transcendently <HI>greater</HI> is the
<HI>Patience</HI> and the <HI>Love</HI> of our <HI>God</HI> to <HI>Us?</HI> For al|though
<PB N="118" REF="66">
by <HI>continuing</HI> in our <HI>Impieties,</HI> we often
<HI>Crucify</HI> his <HI>Son,</HI> he is not only <HI>inclinable</HI> to give
a <HI>Pardon,</HI> or a <HI>Reprieve,</HI> but does <HI>invite</HI> and <HI>desire</HI>
us to give him <HI>leave</HI> too.</P>
<P>&sect;. 7. If ye will take a right <HI>Prospect</HI> of <HI>both
together,</HI> (I mean the twofold transcendency
both of his <HI>Patience</HI> and his <HI>Love,)</HI> hear him
<HI>speaking</HI> unto <HI>Israel,</HI> and through <HI>Israel</HI> unto
<HI>our selves.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MICHA 6. 9.</BIBL>
<Q>Hear ye the Rod, and who hath Appointed it.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>&sect;. 1. THe Text (as things stand) should
now be handl'd in such a manner, as
to respect the double quality and complexion
of the Time. A Time of <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> and
<HI>Fasting</HI> too. A Time of great <HI>Comfort,</HI> and yet
of <HI>Mourning.</HI> A Time which placeth us in the
Confine of those two Passions, which seiz'd
upon the two <HI>Maries</HI> at the Sepulcher of our
Lord; from which they are said to have de|parted,
<HI>with Fear and great Ioy.</HI> Mat. 28. 8.</P>
<P>First 'tis matter to us of <HI>Ioy,</HI> that after the
very same measure in which our Enemies from
abroad did Increase upon us, our abler Enemy
here at home began to be at Peace with us.
And I think I may say without a Figure, that
both the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> have one Defeat
without Fighting. For, weighing well the two
<PB N="124" REF="69">
Grounds whereupon the two Nations pre|sum'd
against us, The <HI>unanimity</HI> of our <HI>Coun|trymen</HI>
corrects the <HI>Insolence</HI> of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
the <HI>Abatement</HI> of our <HI>Pestilence</HI> does Plague the
<HI>French</HI> for their <HI>Supercherie.</HI></P>
<P>But yet 'tis matter to us of <HI>Fear,</HI> and of <HI>Hu|miliation,</HI>
that though the Pestilence <HI>decreases,</HI>
it also <HI>continues</HI> in some degree; That whilst
the Rod is <HI>removing,</HI> 'tis also <HI>hanging</HI> over our
<HI>heads;</HI> And though the <HI>Furie</HI> of the Judgment
is (God be thanked) well <HI>pass'd,</HI> yet the <HI>sense</HI>
of its <HI>Threatnings</HI> is <HI>present</HI> with us. We know
the <HI>Autumn,</HI> many times, is a <HI>pregnant</HI> season;
nor can we Prophecy, <HI>This</HI> Month, what the
<HI>Next</HI> may bring forth. And as the <HI>likelihood</HI> of
a <HI>Victory</HI> must needs be very much allay'd by
the <HI>Possibility</HI> of a <HI>Defeat;</HI> so must the <HI>Hopes</HI> of
a <HI>Recovery</HI> by the great <HI>Danger</HI> of a <HI>Relaps.</HI> And
seeing the Wisdom of Authority hath still ap|pointed
this Day (although a Day of no sad
Tidings) to be observ'd in all our Churches as
a <HI>Day</HI> of Solemn <HI>Humiliation;</HI> let us <HI>Rejoyce</HI>
with so much <HI>Trembling</HI> at the <HI>Retreat</HI> of God's
Anger, as by <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Fasting</HI> to stop the
way to its <HI>Return.</HI> The Text which now lies
before us is very fit for this Purpose. For</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="69">&sect;. 2. Now it was that <HI>God's People,</HI> the
men of <HI>Israel</HI> and of <HI>Iudah,</HI> after their mani|fold
obligations to <HI>Watch,</HI> and <HI>Pray,</HI> and give
<HI>Thanks,</HI> for their Deliverance out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that
<HI>House of Bondage,</HI> were most securely faln <HI>asleep</HI>
in a dead <HI>Lethargy</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> A <HI>sleep</HI> in which they
lay <HI>snoring</HI> with such <HI>Indulgency</HI> to Themselves,
that all his <HI>ordinary Calls</HI> were too <HI>low</HI> to <HI>wake</HI>
them. But God hath <HI>two</HI> sorts of <HI>Voices</HI> where|by
to <HI>rouze</HI> us into <HI>Repentance.</HI> The <HI>one</HI> he ut|ters
by his <HI>Prophets,</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> by his <HI>Rod.</HI>
And we have <HI>Both</HI> in <HI>this verse,</HI> whereof my
<HI>Text</HI> is the <HI>later part.</HI> For what we call the
<HI>Lord's Voice,</HI> in the next words before my <HI>Text,</HI>
The <HI>Chaldee</HI> paraphraseth well by <HI>[the voice of
the Prophets of the Lord.]</HI> And <HI>This</HI> was it he <HI>first</HI>
us'd to the men of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> and <HI>Samaria.</HI> Nor
did he <HI>whisper</HI> into the <HI>Ear</HI> of only here and
there <HI>one,</HI> but extended it to the <HI>hearts</HI> and the
<HI>ears</HI> of <HI>all. The Lord's Voice cryeth unto the City,</HI>
that is, his <HI>voice</HI> by the <HI>Prophets is lifted up like
a Trumpet, to shew the people their Transgressions,
and the House of Iacob their Sins.</HI> (Isa. 58. 1.)
But since the <HI>Voice</HI> by his <HI>Prophets</HI> is only heed|ed
by very <HI>few,</HI> (that is to say, here and there
by a <HI>man of Wisdom,)</HI> at least give ear unto the
<PB N="126" REF="70">
<HI>voice</HI> which now he uttereth by his <HI>Rod;</HI> and
look ye up unto the <HI>hand</HI> that hath <HI>laid it on.</HI>
The <HI>Chaldee</HI> Paraphrase on the <HI>Persons</HI> to
whom the words are directed is most remark|able.
For 'tis not only, <HI>hear ye Tribes;</HI> as the
<HI>Septuagint</HI> read, and the <HI>vulgar Latine;</HI> nor only
<HI>hear ye the Rod;</HI> as the <HI>Interlineary Hebrew.</HI> But,
<HI>here ye Princes,</HI> and <HI>Rulers,</HI> and <HI>People of the
Earth.</HI> Or (as I find it translated by Learned
<HI>Grotius) Audite Rex, &amp; Proceres, &amp; Conventus.</HI>
Which I cannot better <HI>English,</HI> than by <HI>King,
Lords,</HI> and <HI>Commons.</HI> Let your <HI>Qualities</HI> or
<HI>Conditions</HI> be what they will, <HI>Audite Vos Virgam,
Hear Ye the Rod.</HI> So that the <HI>Voice</HI> of the <HI>Pro|phets,</HI>
(in the <HI>beginning</HI> of the verse,) does seem
to differ just as much, from the <HI>voice</HI> of the
<HI>Rod,</HI> (in the <HI>later end,</HI>) as the <HI>Prophecy</HI> from the
<HI>Iudgment</HI> which is <HI>Prophecyed of;</HI> or as the
<HI>Threat</HI> from the <HI>Sentence,</HI> and some <HI>degree</HI> of
<HI>Execution;</HI> or as the <HI>Preaching</HI> from the <HI>Text</HI>
which is <HI>Preached on.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 3. <HI>This</HI> is therefore God's <HI>Method</HI> for the
calling of <HI>Sinners</HI> unto <HI>Repentance.</HI> The pub|lick
<HI>Preachers</HI> of his <HI>Word</HI> do <HI>first</HI> give <HI>warning.</HI>
Then the truly <HI>wise in heart</HI> do <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>tremble</HI>
at the Word Preach'd. Yet the <HI>foolish</HI> and <HI>in|considerate,</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="70">
(who are the <HI>most</HI> of Mankind) be|ing
<HI>deaf</HI> to that <HI>Word,</HI> and not <HI>afraid</HI> of that
<HI>Warning,</HI> The <HI>Rod</HI> comes in with its <HI>Sermon,</HI>
or <HI>excitation</HI> to <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>All</HI> are conju|red
to <HI>hearken</HI> to it.</P>
<P>This (considering how the <HI>words</HI> are made
<HI>obscure</HI> by an <HI>Elipsis,</HI> which the most <HI>Critical
Commentators</HI> have several Methods of <HI>filling up)</HI>
I do conceive to be the <HI>plainest</HI> and most <HI>satis|factory</HI>
scope of the words in Hand. <HI>The Lords
Voice cryeth unto the City, and the man of wisdom
shall see thy Name.</HI></P>
<P>Hear ye the Rod, and who hath appointed it.</P>
<P>&sect;. 4. The Text in the <HI>General,</HI> or in the
<HI>Great,</HI> does present us with an <HI>Embassy</HI> from
<HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>Earth;</HI> which being taken in the <HI>Re|tail,</HI>
doth spread it self into these Particulars.</P>
<P>First the <HI>Embassadour</HI> here <HI>employ'd;</HI> and that
is <HI>expressed</HI> to be the <HI>Rod.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly the <HI>People</HI> to whom <HI>directed;</HI> And
These are <HI>imply'd</HI> in the Pronown <HI>Ye.</HI> My <HI>Israel,</HI>
my Chosen, the peculiar Lot of mine Inheri|tance,
<HI>Audite Vos, hear Ye.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly the <HI>Audience,</HI> or <HI>Attention,</HI> which is
to be given to the Embassadour; <HI>Audite, Hear.</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="71">
Last of all we have the <HI>Potentate</HI> from whom
the Embassadour is <HI>dispatch'd,</HI> described clearly
by the <HI>Periphrasis</HI> of <HI>[Him</HI> who hath <HI>appointed it.]</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second</HI> of these particulars will
be best capable of Discourse, not <HI>severally</HI>
handled, but in <HI>conjunction.</HI> For the close Ap|plication
of the <HI>Embassadour</HI> to the <HI>People,</HI> the
<HI>Rod</HI> to <HI>Israel,</HI> will very seasonably afford us this
<HI>Doctrinal Proposition.</HI></P>
<P>That God Almighty is so far from <HI>conniving
at,</HI> or <HI>not seing</HI> Sin in his <HI>Children,</HI> (though the
<HI>Tempter</HI> in these Times hath taught a great num|ber
of men to <HI>flatter</HI> themselves into <HI>Destruction</HI>
by this Opinion,) that he <HI>hates,</HI> and <HI>will punish</HI>
it, much more in <HI>Them,</HI> than in <HI>Those</HI> that are
<HI>Stranger,</HI> and <HI>Aliens</HI> to him.</P>
<P>&sect;. 1. Which to the end I may evince in the
<HI>clearest Method</HI> that I can use, I shall first of all
observe out of <HI>Aulus Gellius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aul. Gell. l. 6. c. 14. p. 224.</NOTE> (what He him|self
does observe out of <HI>Plato</HI>'s <HI>Gorgias,)</HI> That
there are <HI>three</HI> distinct <HI>ends</HI> for which Offenders
are to be punish'd. Whereof the <HI>first</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign">,
for the <HI>Amendment</HI> of <HI>Offenders.</HI> The <HI>second</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign">, for the <HI>Benefit</HI> of such as are <HI>Lookers-on.</HI>
The <HI>third</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, for the Party's <HI>Satis|faction</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="71">
who is <HI>Offended.</HI> And if we look on all
<HI>Three,</HI> as they are applicable to <HI>God,</HI> in his
laying on of <HI>stripes</HI> on the <HI>sons of Men;</HI> whe|ther
the <HI>End</HI> of his Inflictions is to <HI>redeem us
from our Iniquities,</HI> or to <HI>fright Lookers-on</HI> from
daring to do as we have don, or to make some
<HI>Amends</HI> to his <HI>injur'd Goodness;</HI> we shall find
him ever <HI>Iust,</HI> after the measure that he is
<HI>Merciful.</HI> And as he is <HI>kinder</HI> by much to the
<HI>little Flock,</HI> which he hath tenderly Pent up in
his rich <HI>Inclosure,</HI> than to the <HI>numerous Herd</HI>
which are turn'd out into the <HI>Common,</HI> so is he
<HI>rigider</HI> to the <HI>Sheep</HI> that rudely <HI>break out</HI> of the
<HI>Fold,</HI> than to the <HI>Swine</HI> or the <HI>Goats</HI> that were
<HI>never in</HI> it. For the better evidencing of which,
let us consider his <HI>Rod of Iustice</HI> with its <HI>three
final Causes,</HI> and mark how fitly it tends to <HI>each.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. First I say the <HI>Rod</HI> of God is <GAP DESC="foreign">,
(as <HI>Plutarch</HI> calls it,) the <HI>Med'cin,</HI> or <HI>means</HI>
of <HI>Cure,</HI> unto the <HI>Souls</HI> of such men as are <HI>sick</HI>
of <HI>Sin. So much</HI> the Med'cin, that <HI>Plato</HI> will
allow it <HI>no other end;</HI> and <HI>Lucius Seneca</HI> looks
upon it, as a Thing that can be useful for <HI>no|thing
else.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seneca de Ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. l. 1. <HI>r.</HI> 16. p. 406.</NOTE> Nemo prudens punit, quia peccatur,

because we have <HI>already</HI> sin'd, but only to the

end we may sin <HI>no more.</HI> And his <HI>Reason</HI> is as
<HI>plausible</HI> as the <HI>matter</HI> will <HI>bear. Revocari praete|rita
non possunt, futura prohibentur.</HI> Whatsoever
is <HI>past,</HI> is past all <HI>Remedy;</HI> And an <HI>evil</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI>
already <HI>don,</HI> no <HI>evil</HI> of <HI>Punishment</HI> can have the
power to <HI>undo.</HI> But what is <HI>future,</HI> and yet <HI>to
come,</HI> may be anticipated <HI>at present;</HI> and though
we cannot <HI>retrive yesterday,</HI> we may wisely
provide against the <HI>morrow.</HI> Nay the <HI>sharpest</HI> of
<HI>Remedies</HI> is so <HI>desirable,</HI> where <HI>continuance</HI> in
<HI>Sin</HI> is the <HI>Disease,</HI> that when the <HI>Patient</HI> cannot
be <HI>cur'd,</HI> 'tis a kind of a <HI>Favour,</HI> to <HI>cut him off.
Interdum ut pereant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Helio|dor. lib. 1.</NOTE> interest pereuntium.</HI> Even
<HI>Destruction it self</HI> is many times very <HI>Medicinal.</HI>
And many <HI>thousands</HI> had been <HI>undo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> if they had
<HI>not perish'd.</HI> Sure I am that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was of this
opinion, when <HI>he deliver'd men up to Satan for
the Destruction of the Flesh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5. 5.</NOTE> that their Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s might
be saved in the Day of the Lord Iesus.</HI> And re|flecting

man that he had never been born;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Plotinus Enn. 1. l. 7. p. 62.</NOTE> we may infer,
with good <HI>Logick,</HI> It had been <HI>good</HI> for that
man, to have <HI>liv'd</HI> very <HI>little beyond</HI> his <HI>Birth.</HI>
For when the <HI>Devil</HI> shall give a <HI>Visit</HI> to such an
<HI>Impenitent</HI> on his <HI>Death-bed,</HI> his <HI>wish</HI> will una|voidably

be <HI>one</HI> of these <HI>two,</HI> That he had <HI>led</HI>

<P>&sect;. 3. To make my meaning more plain by
a familiar Illustration; Admit the <HI>Arm</HI> or the
<HI>Legg</HI> of any mans body is <HI>gangren'd,</HI> we do not
say it is the <HI>Cruelty,</HI> but the <HI>Skill</HI> of the <HI>Chirur|geon</HI>
to <HI>cut it off.</HI> And if the <HI>Patient</HI> being angry
shall <HI>expostulate</HI> with the Artist in such a Case,
or demand by what <HI>Authority</HI> he does such
things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crysost. ad 2. Cor. 7. 13.</NOTE> St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> tells him he may An|swer,

(whether <HI>Truth,</HI> or <HI>Fiction,)</HI> does shew a good

this Opinion. For it seems they could not in|vent
a severer Punishment to the <HI>Iew,</HI> for his
having <HI>contumeliously struck</HI> our Saviour, as he
was going from <HI>Pilate's House</HI> unto the <HI>Place of

<GAP DESC="foreign">, for the <HI>Benefit</HI> of such as are <HI>Lookers-on.</HI>
And it tends to their Benefit in <HI>two respects.</HI>
First by <HI>removing</HI> an <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> which
might otherwise make them <HI>worse,</HI> and next by
<HI>shewing</HI> one of <HI>Punishment,</HI> which hath an Apti|tude
at least to make them <HI>better.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 5. For the first of these two there is very
great Reason. Because your <HI>Exemplary</HI> Sinners
are such a <HI>publick</HI> sort of Mischiefs, such <HI>Epi|demical</HI>
Diseases, that <HI>Seneca</HI> looks upon them
as on <HI>Venemous Beasts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seneca de Ira, lib. 2.</NOTE> and professeth he would
destroy them with the same temper of mind,
<PB N="135" REF="74">
wherewith he would <HI>chop off a Vipers Head;</HI> lest
by permitting them to <HI>live,</HI> and to fill the
<HI>Aire</HI> with their <HI>poison,</HI> they should happen to
be <HI>contagious</HI> to all that <HI>neighbour</HI> within their

them <HI>both</HI> in as great hast, as a man would have
us'd to a <HI>couple</HI> of <HI>Serpents.</HI> And indeed he had
reason for what he did. For as the <HI>rational</HI> kind
of <HI>Viper</HI> is more <HI>malignant</HI> than any other, so of
<HI>that sort</HI> too the most <HI>destructive</HI> is the <HI>religious;</HI>

Aire,</HI> and the <HI>beating upon our shoulders;</HI> the for|mer,
when he <HI>threatens,</HI> and <HI>only threatens</HI> to in|flict
it, the later, when he <HI>proceeds</HI> to put his
<HI>Threats</HI> into <HI>Execution;</HI> so the <HI>Message</HI> which
it brings us is <HI>double</HI> too; for 'tis <HI>expostulatory</HI> in
part, as when it <HI>chides</HI> us for our <HI>Sins;</HI> and in
part it is <HI>exhortatory,</HI> as when it <HI>presses</HI> us to <HI>Re|pentance.</HI>
Such is the admirable contrivance
and disposition of Gods Inflictions, that they
commonly speak his <HI>Mercy</HI> at the same instant
with his <HI>Iustice.</HI> As if it were not sufficient that
his <HI>Ballance</HI> is equal, and that he puts <HI>Punish|ment</HI>
into <HI>one Scale,</HI> as we <HI>Offences</HI> into the <HI>other;</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="80">
He makes the <HI>Punishment</HI> many times to have

just as <HI>general</HI> as their <HI>Sin,</HI> and only a <HI>Lot</HI> exem|pted

he was denyed by the same <HI>Lazarus</HI> a <HI>drop</HI>

it <HI>cryes</HI> as an <HI>Herauld,</HI> that is, it <HI>Proclaims</HI> the

from the Times of the Text to these we live in.
For God hath sent such an <HI>Embassadour</HI> unto
<HI>Us</HI> of <HI>this Nation,</HI> as heretofore to the <HI>People
Israel.</HI> And it is now a great while, since <HI>our
Guilts have risen up into a Rod of wickedness.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezeck. 7. 11.</NOTE> I

twenty years, (and with but little Respiration)
since his <HI>Rod</HI> has been <HI>speaking</HI> to us in <HI>several
Dialects</HI> of <HI>severity.</HI> First of all it spake to us
by <HI>Drums,</HI> and <HI>Trumpets,</HI> and by as many wide
<HI>Mouths,</HI> as the <HI>Sword</HI> had made <HI>wounds</HI> in our
<HI>English</HI> Nation; by <HI>lying Prophets</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI>
by <HI>prosperous Rebels</HI> in the <HI>State,</HI> by loss of <HI>ho|nour,</HI>
and of <HI>Religion,</HI> by <HI>Sacriledge,</HI> and <HI>Regi|cide,</HI>
and other execrable effects of a <HI>Civil War.</HI>
From which we have not yet injoy'd more than
a five years <HI>Respiration,</HI> when our <HI>Unthankful|ness</HI>
for <HI>That</HI> hath betrayed us to a <HI>greater</HI> and
<HI>sadder</HI> Judgment. For so notable is the diffe|rence
betwixt our <HI>War</HI> heretofore, and our <HI>Pe|stilence</HI>
of late, That the <HI>former</HI> might be called
a <HI>Rod</HI> of <HI>Chastisement,</HI> whereas the <HI>later</HI> began

And truly such as it was <HI>there,</HI> it will be <HI>here</HI>
when God pleases. For our <HI>greater means</HI> of

<P>&sect;. 3. Yet so little is this <HI>consider'd,</HI> and <HI>laid
to heart</HI> in our <HI>English</HI> Nation, that our general
<HI>unconcernedness</HI> in the <HI>miseries</HI> of <HI>others,</HI> and our

be <HI>greater</HI> by seeming <HI>less,</HI> does pass with some
for the <HI>greatest</HI> of all our <HI>miseries.</HI> For though
<HI>the Rod</HI> of Gods <HI>Anger,</HI> hath been thus far the
<HI>Rod</HI> of his tender <HI>Love</HI> too, that it hath sought
to gain from us a <HI>Day of Hearing,</HI> first by its
<HI>brushing in the Aire,</HI> and then by its <HI>beating</HI> upon
our <HI>shoulders;</HI> yet so <HI>barbarous</HI> have we been in
our <HI>Reception</HI> of God's <HI>Embassadour,</HI> that we
<PB N="153" REF="83">
have hardly yet allow'd it a patient <HI>Audience.</HI>
We have not <HI>hearkn'd to the Rod,</HI> nor to <HI>him who
hath appointed it.</HI> Nay so much are many of us
become the <HI>worse</HI> for those Messages, which
God had purposely designed to make us <HI>better,</HI>
that we may seem to have abused his <HI>special
Grace</HI> into an Instrument of becoming the more
<HI>ungracious;</HI> And by a necessary consequence,
to have so much of God's <HI>Mercy</HI> as to be <HI>damn'd</HI>
by. For should a <HI>Porphiry</HI> or a <HI>Iulian</HI> revive
amongst us, and together with the <HI>profession</HI>
compare the <HI>practice</HI> of many Christians, they
would have reason to admire, why a <HI>great part</HI>
of <HI>Christendom</HI> should be rather call'd <HI>Christians,</HI>
than by any other Name; why rather <HI>Christi|ans,</HI>
than <HI>Antichristians,</HI> considering how they
live in a direct contrariety, at once to the <HI>Do|ctrine</HI>
and <HI>Life</HI> of Christ, <HI>What have such men to
do to take his Name within their mouths, whilst they
hate to be reform'd, and cast his words behind their

their <HI>King</HI> by the same kind of <HI>Ironie</HI> by which
the <HI>Iews</HI> call'd him <HI>Theirs,</HI> when platting a

<PB N="154" REF="84">
the Gnosticks heretofore, by owning <HI>Christ</HI> for
their <HI>Masters</HI> whilst they were <HI>servants</HI> to the

<HI>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that they esteem'd it

and some such other <HI>enormous Villanies,</HI> as
were not so much as to be <HI>nam'd,</HI> much less
<HI>committed</HI> among the <HI>Heathens;</HI> so 'tis worthily
to be fear'd, that when a sort of <HI>Professors</HI> a|mongst
our selves, who call themselves <HI>Christi|ans,</HI>

spoken of in <HI>Gath,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Clement R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m. in Epist. ad Cor. p. 62.</NOTE> and published abroad in the
<HI>streets</HI> of <HI>Askelon,</HI> the <HI>Daughters of the Philistins</HI>
will too much <HI>rejoyce,</HI> the <HI>uncircumcised</HI> will
greatly <HI>triumph.</HI> I say 'tis too much to be <HI>fear'd,</HI>
(and cannot be too much <HI>consider'd,</HI> unless too
late to be <HI>prevented,</HI>) least that Christ a second
time should become through our means, <HI>To the
Iews a stumbling Block, and to the Greeks Foolish|ness.</HI>
The greatest comfort of hope we have
left is This, That as the scandalous <HI>Aspersions</HI>
which first were cast on <HI>Christianity</HI> were <HI>wash'd
away</HI> by the <HI>Blood</HI> of the antient <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and
<HI>blotted out</HI> by the <HI>Ink</HI> of the learned <HI>Fathers</HI> of

our Nation shall so repent upon the <HI>Preaching</HI>
of the <HI>Rod</HI> which God is now holding over us,
as once the <HI>Ninevites</HI> did at <HI>Ionah</HI>'s; or unless

within it,</HI> (as <HI>Jerusalem</HI> for the <HI>righteousness of

by his Prophet <HI>Isaiah. I will rise up against
them, and cut off from</HI> England <HI>the Name, and

and I will sweep it with the Beesom of Destruction,
saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> Such is the <HI>Voice</HI> of
God's <HI>Red,</HI> whereby it would <HI>fright</HI> us out of

Lessons</HI> of the <HI>Rod.</HI> The Lessons it teacheth us
in particular are more especially these <HI>Three&punc;</HI>
First it teacheth us to <HI>reflect</HI> on those particular
<HI>crying Sins</HI> which have probably been the <HI>Cause</HI>
of our present <HI>Iudgment.</HI> Such as are <HI>Sacrilege,</HI>
and <HI>Simonie, Perjury,</HI> and <HI>Profaneness,</HI> and <HI>Im|patience
of the Cross, Schism,</HI> and <HI>Faction,</HI> and
an <HI>Itch</HI> after <HI>Changes,</HI> and that as well in the
<HI>Civil,</HI> as <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Estate. Next it teacheth
us the Necessity of <HI>casting out</HI> the <HI>Accursed Thing,</HI>
however seemingly as gainful as <HI>Achan</HI>'s <HI>wedge;</HI>
Not an <HI>Agag,</HI> not an <HI>Oxe,</HI> not the <HI>bleating</HI> of a

stands in <HI>competition</HI> with our <HI>obedience.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers. 22.</NOTE> Lastly
the <HI>Rod</HI> which at the present is <HI>threatning</HI> every
one of <HI>Us,</HI> by whipping <HI>others</HI> into their <HI>Graves</HI>
who are round about us, does teach <HI>humility</HI>

whether for the <HI>strength</HI> or the <HI>Bewty</HI> of them.
It seeks to pull down their <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>exalted
thoughts</HI> of <HI>Themselves,</HI> as well as to <HI>abate</HI> their
<HI>contempt</HI> of <HI>Others,</HI> by making them to know
<HI>whereof</HI> they are <HI>made,</HI> and by compelling them
to consider of what <HI>materials</HI> they do <HI>consist.</HI>
For if it is true, what is said by the Philoso|pher,

let us impartially consider, whether the

Time may have wrought within us, does pro|ceed
from a Resentment of <HI>Sins,</HI> or <HI>Sufferings.</HI>
Whether it be a <HI>Contrition,</HI> or an <HI>Attrition</HI> only.
Whether a <HI>sorrow</HI> that is <HI>worldly,</HI> and <HI>worketh

to Salvation,</HI> and therefore is <HI>never to be

to begg of God Almighty, that he will <HI>add</HI> to
our <HI>Patience,</HI> rather than <HI>take from</HI> our <HI>Punish|ment;</HI>

but imagin himself upon his <HI>Death-bed,</HI> And
what <HI>then</HI> would he not give for the <HI>completing</HI>
of that Anxiety, whereof he is now so over apt

help to make us happy even in this present
world, if we have but the Grace to use them
rightly; else they will make us the unhappier

though I never had yet such a <HI>Roman Faith,</HI> as to
believe that there IS such a thing as Purgatory;
yet, with <HI>submission</HI> to <HI>God's Oeconomy,</HI> I think
the most of mankind might be glad there <HI>were.</HI>
Because it seems a very easy Composition with
his Justice, to suffer <HI>Hell</HI> for a <HI>time,</HI> in order to
<HI>happiness</HI> for <HI>Eternity.</HI> It concerns us therefore
to pray, in this conjuncture of our affairs, that

we may discern matter of <HI>Comfort,</HI> whereby to
couple our <HI>Fear</HI> with <HI>Hope.</HI> I say 'tis matter of
<HI>some</HI> Comfort, that God doth seem by his <HI>Cor|rection</HI>
to own us still for <HI>his People;</HI> that he
does not severely suffer us to be <HI>over prosperous</HI>
in our impieties; that he has not so <HI>wholly left</HI>
us, as not to visit us with his <HI>Rod;</HI> but that at
least he does vouchsafe us the <HI>Mercy</HI> of his
<HI>Iudgments</HI> to work upon us. And though he
threatens to give us up to some of the <HI>cruelest</HI> of
our <HI>Enemies,</HI> (such as are the <HI>two plagues</HI> of per|fect
<HI>beggery,</HI> and the <HI>Pestilence,)</HI> 'tis that he may

we may never indure the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of our own

And therefore to the end we may ra|ther

we may observe how mens reflections upon the

Whereas the Christians on the contrary,

were so far from <HI>sincking under,</HI> that ra|ther
of the two they <HI>injoy'd</HI> their sufferings.
Whereof the reason in <HI>Eusebius</HI> is only this,
that they <HI>heard</HI> not the <HI>Rod</HI> only, but had regard
unto <HI>Him who had laid it on.</HI> And so they look't
upon their <HI>Iudgment,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, as the <HI>Test</HI>

God that judgeth the Earth.</HI> Nay if a Messenger
come and tell him (as heretofore 'twas told
<HI>David)</HI> that <HI>he who came out of his Bowels does
seek his Kingdom and his life;</HI> still his Remedy
lies in this, that he can say with <HI>David</HI> still,
<HI>Behold here I am; if the Lord say, I have no de|light
in thee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 15. 26.</NOTE> let him do with me as it seemeth good
to him.</HI> Nay if <HI>Isaiah</HI> bring him a Message, <HI>that
all the Possessions of his house shall be led captive in|to
Babylon, and that the Sons which Issue from him
shall be taken away by force, to serve as Eunuchs

amongst the Heathen;</HI> yet still his Remedy is at
hand, whilst he can answer with <HI>Hezekiah, Good
is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kin. 20. 19.</NOTE> Nay if
the Devil besiege his <HI>Patience</HI> with all the <HI>wittiest</HI>

even <HI>then</HI> he hath his Remedy, whilst he can ask
with holy <HI>Iob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job.</NOTE> shall I receive good things at the
hand of God, and shall I not receive evil</HI> also?
<HI>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, blessed
be the name of the Lord.</HI> Nay if a <HI>Samuel</HI> bring
him Tidings, not of a <HI>private</HI> Judgment only,
<HI>[that the Iniquity of his house shall not be purg'd with
Sacrifice,]</HI> but of a <HI>publick</HI> Judgment also, (which
whosoever shall but hear shall find that <HI>both his
ears shall tingle,)</HI> to wit, That <HI>even the Ark of the

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE 2. 22.</BIBL>
<Q>And when the Dayes of her Purification according
to the Law of Moses, were accomplished, they
brought him to Ierusalem to present him to the
Lord.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>&sect;. 1. VPon the Feast of the <HI>Nativity,</HI> our
Lord himself was a <HI>Present.</HI> Upon
the Feast of the <HI>Epiphanie,</HI> He was <HI>Presented.</HI>
And now on the Feast of <HI>Purification,</HI> He pur|posely
comes to <HI>Present Himself.</HI></P>
<P>He was a <HI>Guift</HI> sent at <HI>Christmas,</HI> from <HI>God</HI>
to <HI>Men.</HI> At <HI>Twelftide</HI> as <HI>God,</HI> he is said to have
<HI>received Guifts of Men.</HI> And now at <HI>Candlemas,</HI>
as <HI>Man,</HI> he is a Guift unto <HI>God</HI> for the Sins of
<HI>Men.</HI> At the 16 verse of this Chapter, the Ru|ral
Votaries from the <HI>Fold</HI> did find him <HI>weeping</HI>
in his <HI>Cratch.</HI> At the 21 verse we find him <HI>bleed|ing</HI>
in His <HI>Cradle.</HI> But in the words of this
Text, we find Him <HI>smiling</HI> (as we may guess)
<PB N="260" REF="135">
in his <HI>Mothers Armes.</HI> She devoutly carrying
<HI>Him,</HI> and her <HI>Devotion</HI> carrying <HI>Her,</HI> and the
Law of <HI>Moses</HI> carrying Both, at once that <HI>Shee</HI>
may be <HI>Purified,</HI> and <HI>He presented</HI> unto the
Lord.</P>
<P>&sect;. 2. I have desir'd so much the rather, in
the choise of this Text, to take advise with the
<HI>Rubrick,</HI> and the <HI>Gospel</HI> appointed for the Day,
Because we have hardly escap'd an Age of so
much <HI>ignorance</HI> in the <HI>Canons,</HI> and <HI>Disobedience</HI>
to the <HI>Commands</HI> of our <HI>English</HI> Church, that
unless the old custome be now reviv'd, the <HI>Peo|ple</HI>
of <HI>England</HI> (like the <HI>Italian Priest,)</HI> will be
in danger of disputing in time to come, whether
the <HI>Rubrick</HI> be <HI>Fish</HI> or <HI>Flesh;</HI> and be as apt to
be in doubt, as the Man in <HI>Poggius,</HI> whether
the <HI>Pentecost</HI> were a <HI>Man</HI> or a <HI>Woman.</HI> Again I
choose so much the rather, to do the work of
each day on the day it self, because the <HI>Festivals</HI>
of the <HI>Church</HI> being consider'd in conjunction,
do comprehend the <HI>Fundamentals of Christian
Faith.</HI> And so a Pertinent discourse upon each
of <HI>Them,</HI> will (when the <HI>Calendar</HI> is expir'd) be|come
a <HI>Body of Divinity.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 3. I shall therefore make hast to the due
Solemnity of the Day; and by premising its
<PB N="261" REF="135">
several <HI>Names,</HI> shall give a guess at some part
of its <HI>Nature</HI> too. 'Tis call'd the Feast of <HI>Pu|rification,</HI>
from the Pure Virgins being <HI>cleans'd</HI>
from her Mosaical <HI>Impurity.</HI> The word <HI>Impuri|ty</HI>
being us'd by such a Scriptural <HI>Catachresis,</HI> as
only to signifie the <HI>yoke,</HI> or the <HI>obligation,</HI> which
by the <HI>ordinance</HI> of <HI>Moses</HI> was fasten'd on her.
'Tis call'd the Feast of <HI>Presentation,</HI> from our
Lords condescension to be presented unto the
Lord. It might have been called the <HI>Feast of
Ransome,</HI> because no sooner was he <HI>presented</HI>
and given to God, but he was presently <HI>bought
back</HI> with a <HI>Piece</HI> of <HI>Silver.</HI> 'Twas commonly
call'd <HI>Hypapante</HI> throughout the Churches of
the <HI>East,</HI> from the Interview and meeting be|twixt
our <HI>Saviour</HI> and good old <HI>Simeon,</HI> (v. 28.)
<HI>Candlemas</HI> it was call'd, or the <HI>Feast of Lights,</HI>
because of a Custome still <HI>retein'd</HI> in the <HI>Church
of Rome,</HI> though worthily cast off by the <HI>Church
of England;</HI> for that of old it was the Day
wherein they consecrated <HI>Candles,</HI> and that in
honour to the Idol which was commonly call'd
<HI>Februa.</HI> A Goddess feign'd to be propitious to
pregnant Women in their Child-births; and
therefore allow'd to have the Priviledge of
giving a <HI>Name</HI> to this <HI>Month,</HI> as well as the
<PB N="262" REF="136">
mode of Solemnizing this very <HI>Day.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 4. From whence (by the way) 'twill not
be useless to observe, that the <HI>purifying</HI> of <HI>Wo|men</HI>
after the Agonies of their Child-birth, is a
thing common to us of <HI>Christendom,</HI> not only
with the <HI>Iews,</HI> but the <HI>Gentiles</HI> too; and may
be matter of contention to the Malice or Igno|rance
of a Sect, which is either so <HI>stupid</HI> as not
to <HI>know,</HI> or else so <HI>obstinate</HI> as not to <HI>acknowledge,</HI>
or at least so over <HI>peevish</HI> as not to admit of a
<HI>consideration,</HI> That the very <HI>same custome</HI> in se|veral
Places, may receive its Beginning from
<HI>God</HI> and <HI>Belial;</HI> though not observed in the
<HI>sam&eacute;,</HI> but in a <HI>contrary</HI> manner; not with the
<HI>same,</HI> but with a <HI>contrary</HI> mind; nor at all to
the <HI>same,</HI> but to a <HI>contrary</HI> end. <GAP DESC="foreign"> (saith
<HI>Gregory Nazianzen)</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. The <HI>Iew</HI> keeps
Holy-Day, but according to the <HI>Letter.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">
The <HI>Gentile</HI> keeps Holy-Day, but according to
the <HI>Flesh.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, The <HI>Christian</HI> also keeps
Holy-Day, but according to the <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 5. Let us <HI>Rejoyce</HI> then on <HI>This Day,</HI> be|cause
<HI>it is the Day which the Lord hath made.</HI> And
again let us <HI>rejoyce,</HI> even because it is the Day
which hath <HI>made the Lord.</HI> I mean hath made
him, of a <HI>Lord,</HI> to become a <HI>Servant;</HI> hath made
<PB N="263" REF="136">
him, of a <HI>God,</HI> to become a <HI>Votary;</HI> hath made
him of a <HI>Giver</HI> become a <HI>Guift.</HI> The Lord him|self,
on <HI>this Day,</HI> having been brought unto <HI>Ieru|salem,</HI>
to be <HI>presented</HI> unto the Lord.</P>
<P>&sect;. 6. And as the <HI>Text</HI> does thus instruct us
to the <HI>Solemnity</HI> of the Day; so the double
Solemnity of the Day does teach us how to
<HI>divide</HI> the Text; or rather the Text divides it
self into these two Generals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Purification</HI> of our <HI>Lady,</HI> and the <HI>Pre|sentation</HI>
of our <HI>Lord.</HI> For each of which com|pellations,
we have not only <HI>Custome,</HI> but <HI>Reason</HI>
too. For as <HI>Christ</HI> in the <HI>Greek</HI> does import a
<HI>Lord,</HI> so <HI>Mary</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is known to signifie
a <HI>Lady.</HI> And it is obvious to infer, That She
may well be <HI>our</HI> Lady, who was the Mother
of <HI>our</HI> Lord.</P>
<P>In both these Generals put together, there
are seven Particulars to be observ'd.</P>
<P>First the <HI>Actions,</HI> which are express'd; <GAP DESC="foreign">,
they <HI>brought,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> they <HI>presented.</HI> Next the
<HI>Agents,</HI> which are imply'd; namely the <HI>Rela|tions</HI>
and <HI>Friends</HI> of Christ. <HI>They</HI> brought, and
<HI>They</HI> presented. Thirdly the <HI>Subject,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,
they brought <HI>Him.</HI> Fourthly the <HI>Place;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,
to <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Fifthly the <HI>End;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<PB N="264" REF="137">
to <HI>present him unto the Lord.</HI> Sixtly the <HI>Time,</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign">, when the <HI>dayes were accomplished</HI>
wherein the <HI>Mother</HI> was to be <HI>purifyed.</HI> Last of
all the <HI>Obligation</HI> and <HI>Inducement</HI> unto the whole;
and that is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the Law of Moses.</HI></P>
<P>To go no farther than the two Generals,
were too little for the Text; And yet to insist
on each Particular, would be as certainly too
much for the <HI>Time allow'd.</HI> And therefore I shall
pitch on a Middle course; so <HI>extending</HI> the Ge|nerals,
and so <HI>contracting</HI> the Particulars, as
to wind them up together into these four
Bottomes.</P>
<P>The Purification of the Parent, at once a
Maid and a Mother too.</P>
<P>The presentation of her Son, at once pre|sented
unto the Lord, and the Lord presented.</P>
<P>Next the Circumstances or Adjuncts of
Time and Place, wherewith these Actions
were to be cloath'd.</P>
<P>Lastly the <HI>Rule</HI> of the Actions and Adjuncts
too, unto which they both are to be conform'd.</P>
<P>&sect;. 1. I must premise, touching the first, the
<HI>Purification of the Virgin,</HI> (the first in <HI>Order,</HI>
though not in <HI>Dignity,</HI> and perhaps to be <HI>pre|fer'd</HI>
for giving the <HI>Title</HI> unto the <HI>Day,)</HI> That a
<PB N="265" REF="137">
legal <HI>Cleansing</HI> or <HI>Purification</HI> must needs imply
and presuppose a legal <HI>Impurity</HI> and <HI>Pollution;</HI>
for which the Mother being deliver'd, and the

For was shee not <HI>chaster</HI> than the <HI>Turtles</HI> shee

their <HI>Quintessence?</HI> To <HI>purifie</HI> a <HI>Virgin,</HI> may

the <HI>Arabick,</HI> from which our <HI>English Translators</HI>

that <HI>Mary</HI> should be Purified, there is a rea|son
more obvious. Because though <HI>her self</HI> was
a <HI>Mother-Maid,</HI> in so much that a Child-Birth

have <HI>cleansed Her,</HI> (&amp; so her <HI>real Purification</HI> was

was the <HI>Daughter</HI> of a <HI>Conjugal Bed,</HI> and so the
subject of an <HI>Original,</HI> though not an <HI>Actual</HI> Vi|tiosity.
Albeit the <HI>Greek</HI> Fathers are wont to
call her [<GAP DESC="foreign">] <HI>the Mother of God,</HI> yet did they
not make her, by That, a <HI>Goddess;</HI> (as some in

<HI>numbred with the Transgressors,</HI> and so made
subject to the <HI>Levitical,</HI> as well as the <HI>Moral</HI>
Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> (born as he was, of a <HI>Iewish</HI>

<P><MILESTONE N="II"> This (as I said in the Beginning) was the <HI>se|cond
Action</HI> of the <HI>Day,</HI> and so deserves the <HI>second
Place</HI> in the consideration of the <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 1. To give you the History of the Action
from that which gave it its <HI>Original,</HI> I must
goe back to take my <HI>Rise</HI> from as farr as
<HI>Exodus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 12.</NOTE> Where after Sundry dismal miracles
for the freeing of <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> the last
and greatest was shewn at <HI>midnight.</HI> When the
sword of the Lord did <HI>cut off all the first-born</HI>
among the Children of the <HI>Egyptians, from the
first-born of Pharoah that sate on his throne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 29.</NOTE> <HI>to the
first-born of the Captive that lay in the dungeon.</HI> But
the <HI>first-born</HI> of Israel being miraculously <HI>pre|serv'd,</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Chap. 13. Vers. 15.</NOTE> were immediately claimed by their
<HI>preserver.</HI> who besides the <HI>common Interest</HI> which
he had in them as his <HI>Creatures,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 1. 22.</NOTE> did farher <HI>devote</HI>
them unto Himself by a peculiar right of <HI>Re|demption</HI>
too.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 8. 18.</NOTE> And though by way of <HI>Commu|tation</HI>

but that they were farther to be <HI>ransom'd by
the summ of five Shekels.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. Now put all this together, and it will
prove an <HI>Adumbration</HI> of the <HI>holy Child Iesus;</HI>
who, though <HI>the Lord,</HI> and the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> was
yet <HI>presented unto</HI> the <HI>Lord,</HI> and <HI>Redeemed</HI> this
Day with a <HI>piece of Silver.</HI> For <HI>He</HI> was sure
<HI>the Fist-born,</HI> who is expressed so in Scripture by
way of <HI>Eminence,</HI> and whom the <HI>First-born of
Israel</HI> were but intended to <HI>represent.</HI> He <HI>pre|sented</HI>
Himself as our <HI>Elder Brother,</HI> (and so
again the <HI>first-born,)</HI> to redeem us from the
Fury of <HI>the Destroying Angel.</HI> He, as the <HI>First-born,</HI>
or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Psal. 2. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Heir of all things,</HI> was presented
this day to receive his right of <HI>Primogeniture,</HI>
by claiming the <HI>Heathen for his Inheritance,</HI> and
<HI>the uttermost part of the earth for his possession.</HI>
He again was the <HI>first-born,</HI> who presented
<HI>Himself</HI> unto <HI>as many</HI> as would <HI>receive</HI> him,
that he might <HI>give them power to be the Sons of
God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 1. 12.</NOTE> To sum up all in a word, He is call'd
<HI>the First-Born of every Creature</HI> (Col. 1. 15.)

Time;</HI> And the <HI>first-born</HI> of his <HI>Mother,</HI> brought
forth into the world <HI>in the fulness of Time.</HI> He
was again the <HI>first-born</HI> by vertue of his office,
as <HI>Mediator.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> that was <HI>born</HI> of a pure
<HI>Virgin;</HI> the <HI>first</HI> that ever was <HI>born</HI> without the
least stain of <HI>Sin;</HI> the <HI>first</HI> and last that was
<HI>born</HI> both <HI>God and Man.</HI> Many wayes the
<HI>first-born,</HI> he was brought on this day to be
presented unto the <HI>Lord,</HI> not as a <HI>Servant</HI> only,
or <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> but as a <HI>King,</HI> and a <HI>Priest</HI> too,
on whom his Brethren depended for <HI>Life and
Fortune;</HI> so to claim his <HI>own</HI> Right, and so to
communicate it to Us, that <HI>whether Paul, or
Apollo,</HI> whether <HI>Cephas, or the World, whether
life or Death, whether things present or things to
come; All might be ours, as we are Christ's, as
Christ is God's.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 3. From the whole History of the Action,
(so farr at least as our Lord was concerned
in it,) it will be easy enough to gather These
usefull Considerations.</P>
<P>&sect;. 4. First that the Dayes being accom|plish't,
when both the <HI>Mother</HI> and her <HI>Babe</HI>
might have the freedom to goe abroad; The
first Journy they took, was not to <HI>Nazareth,</HI>
<PB N="281" REF="145">
but <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> She brought Him to <HI>God's</HI>
House before her <HI>own.</HI> Implying this Caveat
to Christian Parents, that they suffer not the
<HI>Devil</HI> to take the <HI>first Hansel</HI> of their Children;
but acquaint them with God in their very <HI>Non|age;</HI>
and so <HI>present</HI> them unto Him by a <HI>Reli|gious
Education.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 2.</NOTE> That they devote them to his
Service, even as early as <HI>Hannah</HI> devoted <HI>Sa|muel.</HI>
That their <HI>enmity</HI> to <HI>Sin</HI> be as soon <HI>be|spoken,</HI>
as the Child<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Annorum ferm&egrave; novem, altaribus ad|motus, tactis Sacris jureju|rando adactus ab Amilcare, se quum pri|mum posset, Hostem fore Populo Roma|no. <HI>Liv.</HI> l. 21. <HI>cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>Hanibal</HI> at the Altar was
<HI>bespoken</HI> by his <HI>Father</HI> to <HI>hate</HI> the <HI>Romans.</HI>
That they suffer them not to <HI>lisp</HI> in the <HI>Language</HI>
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but (as Children put to Nurse in the
Land of <HI>Goshen)</HI> make them Suck in <HI>good man|ners</HI>
as soon as <HI>Milk.</HI> That they permit them
not to enter within the <HI>Breath</HI> of the <HI>Prophane,</HI>
from whose un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">avory communication (like the
<HI>New-landed Spaniard,)</HI> they can many times
<HI>Swear,</HI> when they cannot <HI>speak.</HI> That they put
so fit a difference betwixt <HI>themselves</HI> and <HI>Brute-Beasts,</HI>
as to become unto their children, not
only <HI>carnal,</HI> but <HI>spiritual</HI> Parents; and so <HI>beget</HI>
them to <HI>God</HI> by a <HI>second</HI> Birth, as not to afford
them any reason to <HI>Curse</HI> their <HI>first.</HI> This is the
Use we are to make of our first Consideration,
the Mother's seasoning of her Babe, not at <HI>Na|zareth,</HI>
but <HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="146">&sect;. 5. Secondly let us consider, That as of all
the <HI>Iewish</HI> off-spring, not the <HI>Females,</HI> but the
<HI>Males</HI> were to be offer'd unto the <HI>Lord;</HI> (as it
were intimating unto us, that <HI>They alone</HI> may
expect to be admitted into God's Presence,
who <HI>Captivate</HI> the Lusts of the <HI>effeminate Flesh,</HI>
by the <HI>masculine</HI> power of a <HI>controuling spirit;)</HI>
so of all the <HI>Males</HI> too, none but the <HI>best,</HI> or the
<HI>first-born</HI> were set a part for <HI>God's Portion.</HI> For
when I say the <HI>first-born,</HI> I mean the <HI>Might</HI> of
the Parents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 49. 3.</NOTE> <HI>and the beginning of their strength,
the excellency of Dignity, and the excellency of
Power,</HI> as <HI>Iacob</HI> said of his Eldest Son <HI>Reuben.</HI>
They were not <HI>then</HI> like the Parents of our <HI>last</HI>
and <HI>worst</HI> Times, who when their children are
<HI>Blind,</HI> or <HI>Crooked,</HI> or (in a word) <HI>nothing worth,</HI>
do fly for <HI>refuge</HI> to the <HI>Temple,</HI> and make them
<HI>Deodates.</HI> God is little beholding to such a
Parent, who when his Son is too <HI>dull</HI> for either
the <HI>Shop,</HI> or the <HI>Exchange,</HI> does straight <HI>present
him</HI> unto the Lord, by devoting him to serve in
his <HI>dreadful House,</HI> and (as a Minister) to <HI>wait</HI>
at his <HI>holy Table;</HI> Does give him over to the
<HI>Pulpit,</HI> because too old for the <HI>Grammar School;</HI>
And if he cannot <HI>Write</HI> or <HI>Read,</HI> does therefore
teach him to Pray <HI>extempore.</HI> As if to the office
<PB N="283" REF="146">
of a <HI>Workman who needeth not to be asham'd,</HI> there
were nothing required but <HI>lungs and Impudence.</HI>
From the beginning (I am sure) it was not so.
For <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> in time of <HI>Yore</HI> were
thought most proper to be the <HI>Priests.</HI> And
when the <HI>Priesthood</HI> was <HI>Entail'd</HI> on the <HI>Tribe of
Levi,</HI> it was by way of <HI>Prerogative,</HI> and in <HI>reward</HI>
of a special <HI>Service.</HI> The <HI>Best</HI> by <HI>Pedegree,</HI> by
<HI>Sex,</HI> by <HI>Primogeniture,</HI> They that were every
way the <HI>Best,</HI> and the <HI>Choisest</HI> Persons, were set
apart in the <HI>Beginning</HI> for the peculiar Service
of the most High.</P>
<P>&sect;. 6. From whence 'tis obvious to infer,
That as of the <HI>fruit</HI> of a man's <HI>Body,</HI> so by con|sequence
of the <HI>Fruit</HI> of his <HI>Labour</HI> too, of the
<HI>fruit</HI> of his <HI>Substance,</HI> and of the <HI>fruit</HI> of his
<HI>Soul,</HI> of every thing that he calls <HI>His,</HI> He is not
to offer up to <HI>God,</HI> but the <HI>best, and choisest.</HI>
We must not <HI>sacrifice</HI> to <HI>Pleasure</HI> with the
<HI>strength and Beauty</HI> of our Age, and think that
<HI>God</HI> will be content with a <HI>noysome Carkass;</HI>
(like the false <HI>Votary</HI> in the <HI>Apologue,</HI> who <HI>vow'd</HI>
to consecrate unto <HI>Iupiter, Half</HI> of the <HI>All</HI> that
he went to <HI>find,</HI> and presently <HI>finding a Bagg of
Nuts,</HI> made no doubt but he should bravely
<HI>perform</HI> his <HI>Vow,</HI> by giving the <HI>shells</HI> unto his
<PB N="284" REF="147">
<HI>God,</HI> and taking the <HI>Kernels</HI> unto <HI>Himself;)</HI>
This were at <HI>best</HI> to <HI>forsake the world,</HI> because
the <HI>world forsakes Us;</HI> And only to <HI>keep</HI> our
<HI>Baptismal Vow,</HI> because we know not any longer
which way to <HI>break</HI> it. Will God accept of
our <HI>Presenting</HI> our selves unto him, not (as
<HI>Christ</HI> on <HI>this Day,)</HI> when newly come into the
world, But (as the <HI>Clinicks</HI> of old,) at our <HI>going
out?</HI> Will he <HI>accept</HI> of our coming, when we
come to him but in a <HI>Fright?</HI> not of <HI>choise,</HI> but
<HI>necessity?</HI> not at all as to our <HI>best,</HI> but rather as
to our <HI>last,</HI> and our <HI>only</HI> Refuge? Will he <HI>re|ceive</HI>
us when we shall <HI>choose</HI> him as the <GAP DESC="foreign">;
not as the <HI>greatest Good</HI> Thing, but the
<HI>lesser Evil?</HI> not as <HI>better</HI> and more <HI>desirable</HI> than
the Injoyments of the <HI>Earth,</HI> but as <HI>preferrable</HI>
at least to the Pains of <HI>Hell?</HI> It cannot possibly
be our vertue, to be <HI>forsaken</HI> of our <HI>Sins,</HI> or
rather <HI>bereaved</HI> of our <HI>strength</HI> whereby to be
<HI>vigorously Sinfull,</HI> and without which we can
no longer be <HI>sturdy Sinners.</HI> So again, (in pro|portion
to this Discourse,) 'Tis not enought that
we present him with the <HI>Labour</HI> of our <HI>Lipps,</HI>
and that a little towards <HI>Night,</HI> to make our <HI>Time</HI>
the more <HI>supportable;</HI> (which is to make our <HI>bet|ter</HI>

<HI>Fire,</HI> our blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> must be the <HI>God,</HI> and
our <HI>Soul</HI> the <HI>Sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 7. But then withal <HI>(like a sacrifice)</HI> it
must be <HI>pure,</HI> and <HI>unpolluted;</HI> pure, as the <HI>Vir|gin,</HI>
who was this Day <HI>Purified;</HI> And <HI>unpolluted,</HI>
as the <HI>Babe,</HI> who was presented this day in the
holy Place. And yet because we cannot <HI>(other
wayes)</HI> be <HI>purified</HI> as the <HI>Virgin,</HI> much less <HI>per|fect</HI>
as the <HI>Babe,</HI> (who yet hath <HI>commanded</HI> us to
be <HI>perfect, even as our Father in Heaven is perfect,</HI>
Mat. 5. ult. and <HI>to purifie our selves, as Himself
is pure,</HI> 1 Joh. 3. 3.) Because, I say, we cannot
<HI>otherwise</HI> be pure and perfect, Let us do like
the Virgin, (as well <HI>this day,</HI> as from this <HI>day
forwards,)</HI> Take the <HI>Babe</HI> into our <HI>Hearts,</HI> as
<HI>she</HI> now did into her <HI>Armes;</HI> And so together
with our <HI>Saviour,</HI> present <HI>our selves</HI> unto the
Lord. For as the Man that was <HI>condemn'd</HI> by
the <HI>Roman Senate,</HI> procured <HI>Love</HI> as well as <HI>Par|don,</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="148">
by representing the <HI>Scars</HI> in his <HI>naked Bo|some,</HI>
which were the Monuments of his <HI>Suf|ferings</HI>
for the honour and Service of his <HI>Coun|try;</HI>
so to obtein at once our <HI>Pardon</HI> and <HI>Accep|tance</HI>
also at Gods Tribunal, not only <HI>Pardon</HI> of
our <HI>Sins,</HI> but <HI>Acceptance</HI> of our <HI>Persons,</HI> we must
<HI>recount</HI> the many <HI>sufferings</HI> of our Elder Brother
in our behalf;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 2. 17. &amp; 3. 11.</NOTE> pleading the <HI>Scars</HI> and the <HI>Blood|shed</HI>
sustein'd by the <HI>Captain of our Salvation.</HI> To
such <HI>objections</HI> as may be made by an <HI>Injur'd
Iustice,</HI> we must present an <HI>injur'd Iesus</HI> as our
only <HI>Answer</HI> and <HI>Apologie.</HI> To every Arrow
levell'd at us by God's <HI>Displeasure,</HI> we have but
<HI>Christ and Him Crucified</HI> for our <HI>Shield</HI> or <HI>Helmet</HI>
to <HI>intercept</HI> it. Though with our <HI>Prayers</HI> and
our <HI>Tears</HI> (our only <HI>warrantable Weapons)</HI> we
humbly venture to <HI>contend</HI> with the <HI>Lord of
Hosts, hoping the Pungency</HI> of our <HI>sorrow</HI> will
make him <HI>yield;</HI> (yield I mean to his own <HI>Re|sentment,)</HI>
yet may we not hope to <HI>prevaile</HI> up|on
him, unless we stand <HI>behind Christ,</HI> and (as
the Virgin this Day,) <HI>hold him up</HI> as our <HI>Buckler,</HI>
our only <HI>Armour</HI> of <HI>Defence,</HI> against <HI>Himself</HI>
(if need be) as our <HI>Injur'd Iudge</HI> too. For (that
I may shew by an experiment how as a <HI>Buckler</HI>
he must be <HI>weilded,)</HI> be our <HI>misdeeds</HI> never so
<PB N="287" REF="148">
<HI>numerous,</HI> they are no more than his <HI>Merits.</HI>
Though he will come to be our <HI>Iudge,</HI> He is
<HI>first</HI> our <HI>Advocate,</HI> who, before he can <HI>censure,</HI>
will <HI>plead</HI> our Cause. Are our Sins of <HI>deep die?</HI>
his <HI>Blood</HI> was <HI>Crimson,</HI> in which our <HI>sins</HI> being

<HI>dead.</HI> And shall we suffer <HI>by</HI> the Sins, <HI>for</HI> which
he suffer'd? no blessed Lord, Though thou
canst not but <HI>perceive</HI> them as they <HI>lie open</HI> in
our <HI>Souls,</HI> yet being <HI>hid</HI> in his <HI>Grave</HI> thou wilt
not <HI>see</HI> them; or though thou canst not but <HI>see</HI>
them with the Eye of thine <HI>Omniscience,</HI> yet
with that of thy <HI>Iustice</HI> we hope thou <HI>wilt</HI> not;
or though thou canst not but in <HI>Iustice</HI> detest
our <HI>sins,</HI> yet in <HI>Mercy</HI> be thou pleas'd to <HI>forgive</HI>
the <HI>sinners.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 8. Thus the <HI>Feast</HI> of <HI>Presentation</HI> is to be
celebrated by us throughout the year. The <HI>holy
child Iesus</HI> must still be <HI>brought</HI> into the <HI>Temple,</HI>
And All he suffer'd in our behalf be still <HI>pre|sented

a <HI>Duty</HI> begun <HI>too soon?</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. <HI>This had been to chop Logick just
like</HI> Naaman <HI>the</HI> Syrian, <HI>in</HI> the second of Kings,
and the fifth Chapter: <HI>where commanded by</HI>
Elisha to wash himself in the River Iordan, <HI>and
that precisely</HI> seven Times, <HI>whereby to be</HI> clean|sed
of his Leprosie, <HI>(ver. 10.)</HI> He, <HI>instead of being</HI>
thankful, began <HI>(saith the Text)</HI> to be very wroth,
(ver. 11.) <HI>It seem'd to</HI> Him <HI>a strange thing, that
he could not be</HI> clean, <HI>unless he would be</HI> super|stitious.
<PB N="291" REF="150">
<HI>He expected that the</HI> Prophet <HI>should
have</HI> come out to him <HI>in Person, and</HI> calling on the
name of the Lord his God, should have struck his
hand over the Place, and so have recover'd him of
his Leprosie. <HI>What? (saith he in the next verse)</HI>
Are not Abana and Pharpar, Rivers of Damascus,
better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash
in them, and be clean? <HI>Thus did the</HI> Wisdom <HI>of</HI>
Elisha <HI>seem</HI> light <HI>as</HI> Folly, <HI>whilst</HI> weigh'd <HI>in the</HI>
scales <HI>of that</HI> Syrian Fool. <HI>But though he pre|sently
went away, not</HI> obedient, <HI>but</HI> in a Rage,
<HI>(ver. 12.) Yet his Servants said That (ver. 13.)
which turn'd his</HI> Rage <HI>into</HI> Obedience. My Fa|ther,
if the Prophet had bid thee do some great thing,
wouldst thou not have don it? how much rather when
he saith unto thee, wash, and be clean? <HI>whereupon
he was cured, (but observe in what order,) first
of his</HI> Folly <HI>and</HI> Disobedience, <HI>and immediately
after of his</HI> Disease <HI>too.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 3. Let us now apply this to certain <HI>Secta|ries</HI>
here at <HI>home,</HI> who often indeavour in their
Discourses to shew the <HI>fitness,</HI> the <HI>lawfulness,</HI>
and many times the moral <HI>Necessity</HI> of their be|ing
<HI>Schismatical</HI> and <HI>Disobedient.</HI> I shall give
but <HI>one</HI> Instance, because I want Time to insist
on many; And in the office of <HI>Confession,</HI> be|cause
<PB N="292" REF="151">
it is amongst <HI>Christians</HI> a kind of <HI>Gospel-Purification.</HI>
The Duty of <HI>Confession</HI> from the
<HI>Penitent</HI> to the <HI>Priest,</HI> hath been commanded
by the Church in the <HI>purest</HI> Times of <HI>Antiquity;</HI>
and however misus'd by the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI>
hath been <HI>reform'd,</HI> and not <HI>abolish'd</HI> by this of
<HI>England.</HI> Now some <HI>Male-Contents</HI> there were,
who thought our Church not clean enough, un|less
they might <HI>sweep</HI> away the <HI>Pavement;</HI> And
amongst many other things, their Stomacks
rose against <HI>Confession.</HI> Will not God (say they)
be pleas'd with the <HI>acknowledgment</HI> of the <HI>Heart,</HI>
but must <HI>That</HI> of the <HI>Mouth</HI> be required also?
Or can we not make it in our <HI>Clossets,</HI> but they
must have it in the <HI>Church</HI> too? Must we powre
out our Souls into the <HI>Ear</HI> of the <HI>Priest?</HI> Or
can he <HI>loose</HI> us from <HI>our</HI> Sins, who is <HI>bound</HI> and
<HI>manicl'd</HI> in his <HI>own?</HI> But I would say to such
an <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Scotish Naaman,</HI> no other thing than
was said by the <HI>Syrian</HI> Servant. <HI>My Brother,
or my Sister; suppose our Mother the Church of</HI>
England, <HI>had bid thee do some great thing, wouldst
thou not cheerfully have don it without Dispute?
How much rather when she saith, wash and be clean?</HI>
That is, <HI>confess, and be forgiven?</HI> vouchsafe to
<HI>write</HI> after the <HI>Copy,</HI> which the <HI>Virgin</HI> and her

thought it <HI>no Robbery</HI> to be <HI>equal</HI> with <HI>God,</HI>
thought it also <HI>no dishonour</HI> to be <HI>equal</HI> with <HI>Man;</HI>

<HI>any where</HI> at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> but in the <HI>Temple;</HI> no
nor <HI>any where</HI> in the Temple, but at the <HI>Altar;</HI>
each of which places, notwithstanding, was <HI>an|tecedently
Indifferent;</HI> and so far only <HI>good,</HI> as
'twas <HI>commanded,</HI> not <HI>commanded</HI> for being <HI>good.</HI>
'Tis in the Power at this day of <HI>God's Vicegerents</HI>

For even <HI>These</HI> under the <HI>Gospel</HI> are at least <HI>me|diately</HI>

so is there also as fit a Time, to <HI>obey God by obey|ing

not make their Duties difficult, by calling them
<HI>humane Impositions;</HI> nor cast about for <HI>expedients</HI>

Not as if the Time of our <HI>Oxford Act</HI> were

<P>&sect;. 3. Never was there any <HI>Exercise</HI> so well
and <HI>laudably perform'd.</HI> For <HI>every one</HI> of these
<HI>Inceptors</HI> was even <HI>fill'd with the holy Ghost.</HI> Every
one <HI>spake as the Oracles of God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4. 11.</NOTE> Every one was
so great a <HI>Linguist,</HI> (not only such a <HI>Polyglot,</HI> but
such a <HI>Pantiglot</HI> in his speaking,) that <HI>Atheneus</HI>
his <HI>Galen</HI> was but an <HI>Infant</HI> in comparison.
Every one was a <HI>Theopneust,</HI> and had the Privi|lege
to speak through a <HI>Door of Utterance,</HI> which
was Divinely <HI>open'd</HI> to him by the <HI>Third Person
<PB N="301" REF="155">

and <HI>lightness,</HI> but to speak <HI>Apophthegmes,</HI>
and <HI>Cubes,</HI> as heretofore with lesse reason 'twas
said of <HI>Socrates.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 4. And in proportion to their <HI>Exercise</HI>
which was so eminently good, we find their <HI>Au|ditorie</HI>
too was extremely great. Never was
there such a Concourse of <HI>Spectators</HI> and <HI>Hear|ers</HI>
at any <HI>Act,</HI> or <HI>Comitia,</HI> before, or after. For
there were present at this Assembly, both <HI>Iews,</HI>
and <HI>Proselytes;</HI> And of these last, <HI>of every na|tion
under Heaven,</HI> (v. 5.) which though spoken
by an <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> a very ordinary figure amongst
the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> (for no man certainly will say
there were <HI>French,</HI> or <HI>English, Scotch,</HI> or <HI>Irish,</HI>
which yet at that Time were of <HI>some of the Na|tions
under Heaven;)</HI> Yet <HI>Parthians, Medes,</HI> and

<PB N="302" REF="156">
Cretes,</HI> and <HI>Arabians, and strangers of Rome,</HI> we
are certain were a part of that mighty Con|course,
which flock't about the New Doctors,
and <HI>heard them speak</HI> to their Amazement <HI>in
their several Languages</HI> and <HI>Dialects,</HI> the tre|mendous
and <HI>wonderful works of God,</HI> (v. 11.)</P>
<P>&sect;. 5. And yet I say these <HI>Apostles</HI> were but
<HI>Inceptors</HI> in <HI>Divinity.</HI> They did all at this <HI>Assem|bly</HI>
no more then celebrate their <HI>Commencement.</HI>
For though their Master gave them a <HI>Call</HI> whilst
he was yet upon the <HI>Earth,</HI> yet to execute their
Calling, He did not give them <HI>Qualifications</HI> till
he ascended into <HI>Heaven. (Eph.</HI> 4. 10. 11.) He
who commission'd them <HI>to go, and to teach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll Na|tions,
(Mat.</HI> 28. 18.) did also commission them
to <HI>tarry, and not depart from Hierusalem,</HI> but with
meeknesse there <HI>wait for the promise of the Father,
(Act.</HI> 1, 4.) St. <HI>Iohn</HI> is positive, and dogmatical,
That <HI>the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that
Iesus was not yet glorified. (Ioh.</HI> 7, 39.) And 'tis
as evident from St. <HI>Luke (Act.</HI> 1, 5,) that till this
<HI>Actus Comitialis,</HI> or Solemn <HI>Assembly</HI> at <HI>Hierusa|lem,</HI>
they had <HI>not been baptiz'd with the Holy Ghost.</HI>
From whence it follow's, That if they had only
had an eye unto their <HI>mission,</HI> and <HI>Commission,</HI> and
taken their Journeys thereupon into the several
<PB N="303" REF="156">
Quarters of the world, they had shew'd them|selves
<HI>Zealous,</HI> but <HI>Indiscreet</HI> too; And their
Preaching might have been <HI>good,</HI> but <HI>ineffectual.</HI>
For <HI>all</HI> the <HI>world</HI> (except their <HI>Country-men)</HI> had
been <HI>Barbarians</HI> unto <HI>Them,</HI> and <HI>They Barbarians</HI>
to <HI>all</HI> the <HI>world,</HI> had they only spoken <HI>Syriac,</HI> as
hitherto they had don. If their <HI>Toungs</HI> had not
been <HI>cloven</HI> into all kinds of <HI>Dialect,</HI> how could
their <HI>Sound have gon out into all Lands, and their
words unto the Ends of the Earth?</HI> How many
men's <HI>Souls</HI> were to be <HI>heal'd,</HI> by their miracu|lous
Ability to heal their <HI>Bodys?</HI> How could the
<HI>Scholars</HI> have <HI>repeated</HI> whatsoever the <HI>Master</HI> had
said unto them, (he having not <HI>written,</HI> nor they
taken <HI>Notes,)</HI> but that <HI>the Spirit</HI> was now by
<HI>miracle</HI> to <HI>bring all things to their Remembrance.
(Ioh.</HI> 14, 26.) So that besides the <HI>holy Function</HI>
unto which they were admitted some weeks
<HI>before,</HI> there was an absolute Necessity they
should have <HI>Qualities</HI> to <HI>discharge</HI> it. <HI>Graces</HI>
they had <HI>before,</HI> for the <HI>Sanctification</HI> of <HI>Them|selves;</HI>
But <HI>now</HI> it was that they had <HI>Gifts,</HI>
for the <HI>Edification</HI> also of <HI>others.</HI> They had <HI>before</HI>
a kind of <HI>Thummim,</HI> sett by God upon their
<HI>Hearts;</HI> But not 'till <HI>now</HI> had they the <HI>Urim,</HI>
divinely sitting upon their <HI>Heads</HI> too.</P>

been fill'd with the holy-Ghost, and been enabled to

utterance.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 7. The Text perhaps might be divided
into almost as many Parts, as there were <HI>Lan|guages</HI>
and <HI>Tongues</HI> for the Subject of it. Parts,
enough to <HI>entertain,</HI> if not to <HI>tyre</HI> a Congrega|tion;
enough to <HI>direct,</HI> and <HI>distract</HI> Attention.
But I shall mention only <HI>those,</HI> which will be
<PB N="307" REF="158">
sufficient to acquaint you with its <HI>whole rational
Importance.</HI> As</P>
<P>First the <HI>Persons here endow'd,</HI> who were a
Dozen of <HI>illiterate</HI> and obscure <HI>Galileans,</HI> grown
in the twinkling of an eye, <HI>Learned Professors of
Divinity.</HI> And so by consequence in propriety
of Academical speech, we cannot say that they
were <HI>made,</HI> but <HI>created</HI> Doctors. At once the
<HI>first</HI> and the <HI>greatest</HI> that ever were in the Chri|stian
world. For</P>
<P>Here is secondly the <HI>Measure</HI> according to
which they were indow'd. They were not <HI>sea|son'd</HI>
only, as <HI>others,</HI> or as <HI>themselves</HI> a little <HI>be|fore,</HI>
(when their great Master <HI>breath'd upon
them,</HI> and bid them <HI>receive the Holy Ghost,</HI> Joh.
20, 22;) But <HI>now</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>they were fill'd.</HI> And
<HI>fill'd</HI> they were in such sort, that we shall see
by and by how they <HI>overflow'd.</HI> Nor were they
fill'd more ordess, as their <HI>Persons</HI> or their <HI>Parts</HI>
were more or less to be rever'd in the eyes of
men; For</P>
<P>Here is thirdly the <HI>Equality</HI> and <HI>Universality</HI>
of its <HI>Extent;</HI> which was not only unto <HI>Peter,</HI>
who was the <HI>first</HI> of this <HI>Assembly,</HI> (as 'twere the
<HI>Senior of the Act,)</HI> no nor onely to <HI>Iames</HI> and
<HI>Iohn,</HI> the <HI>sons</HI> of <HI>Zebedee</HI> and of <HI>Thunder,</HI> who
<PB N="308" REF="159">
lately <HI>disputed</HI> between themselves, <HI>which of them
should be the greatest;</HI> But without any <HI>Partia|lity,</HI>
either to the <HI>Qualities,</HI> or <HI>Years</HI> of men,
<GAP DESC="foreign">, they <HI>All</HI> were filled. Nor were
they filled with a <HI>Vapour</HI> or <HI>wind</HI> of <HI>Doctrine,</HI>
which commonly comes from <HI>another spirit,</HI>
(even <HI>the spirit which is now working in all the chil|dren
of Disobedience,)</HI> nor with a <HI>zeal without
knowledge,</HI> or with a <HI>knowledge which puffeth up,</HI>
as being apt to <HI>ferment</HI> in the minds of men;)
For</P>
<P>Here follows in the fourth place the excel|lent
<HI>nature</HI> of the endowment; it was <GAP DESC="foreign">,
they all were fill'd with the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI>
Which is not so properly and literally, as <HI>Me|tonymically</HI>
spoken. Not exclusively of his <HI>Per|son,</HI>
but more especially of his <HI>Power.</HI> Nor
exclusively of his <HI>Graces,</HI> but more especially
of his <HI>Gifts,</HI> (for so in distress of better <HI>English,</HI>
I am contented to speak the difference, as the
<HI>Hellenisticks</HI> do, by calling them <GAP DESC="foreign">.)</P>
<P>Fifthly the Primary <HI>Effect,</HI> shewing the <HI>Ver|tue</HI>
of the <HI>Descent</HI> of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> very par|ticularly
express'd in <HI>the Gift of Tongues,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<HI>they began to speak;</HI> that is, to propagate
the Gospel throughout the world. They be|gan
<PB N="309" REF="159">
to be <HI>Enthusiasts</HI> in the <HI>literal sense.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 16, 17</NOTE> For
they spake with such Tongues as they never
learnt. With <HI>other Tongues,</HI> saith St. <HI>Luke;</HI> with
<HI>new Tongues,</HI> saith Saint <HI>Mark;</HI> with <HI>many
Tongues,</HI> saith the <HI>Syriac.</HI> Where 'tis not <HI>Leshon
ve Leshon, with a Tongue and a Tongue,</HI> (such as
<HI>Hypocrites</HI> in Religion are wont to speak with,)
but<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In Syro est, Incipiebant loqui <GAP DESC="foreign"> lingu&acirc; lingu&acirc;. He|braismus ad|modam fami|liaris. <HI>Gualt|perius in Lo cum.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Beleshon Leshon, with a Tongue a Tongue;</HI>
which according to the <HI>Syriacism</HI> by which 'tis
spoken, does only signify the <HI>Dividedness,</HI> not
the <HI>Doubleness of the Tongue.</HI> And yet they were
not <GAP DESC="foreign">, such as took it of <HI>themselves;</HI> nor
did they speak out of their <HI>Memories,</HI> much less
out of their <HI>Inventions.</HI> For</P>
<P>Here is Sixthly the <HI>Principle</HI> (and I may also
say the <HI>Prompter)</HI> from which they spake, be|cause
they spake <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>as the spirit gave
them utterance.</HI> Not as utterance is oppos'd
either to <HI>stammering,</HI> or <HI>dumnesse,</HI> as if 'twere an|swer'd
in the Greek by nothing more than
<GAP DESC="foreign">: For</P>
<P>Seventhly and lastly, the Spirit gave them
<GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, to speak the most <HI>important</HI> and
<HI>pithy</HI> Periods. To speak as <HI>Stewards of the My|steries
of the living God.</HI> To speak as men to
whose Trust was <HI>committed the word of Reconci|liation.</HI>
<PB N="310" REF="160">
To speak as <HI>Angels</HI> whose <HI>Lips</HI> were
made <HI>conservatories</HI> of <HI>knowledge;</HI> and who had
<HI>Tongues that had been touched with a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Isa. 6. 6. 7.</NOTE> Coal from
Gods Altar.</HI> So that <HI>here</HI> the <GAP DESC="foreign"> is of too
<HI>rich</HI> a signification, to be express't by the <HI>Po|verty</HI>
of <HI>English words.</HI> As <HI>many</HI> Tongues as
they had, they wanted <HI>one more,</HI> to express the
hid Treasures of those they had. There are
<HI>three</HI> things at least, which are secretly couch'd
in the <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Wisdom, Zeal,</HI> and <HI>Elocution.</HI> for
we observe in the <HI>Context,</HI> both a <HI>Wind,</HI> and a
<HI>Fire,</HI> and also <GAP DESC="foreign">, a multitude of clo|ven
divided <HI>Tongues. Tongues,</HI> not <HI>in,</HI> but <HI>upon</HI>
their Heads. And truly each of these three hath
such a mystical signification, as seems to have
a clear prospect upon the <GAP DESC="foreign">. For first
of all they had such a <HI>wind,</HI> as to <HI>inspire</HI> them
with <HI>Wisdom:</HI> They had secondly such a <HI>Fire,</HI>
as to <HI>inflame</HI> them with <HI>Zeal:</HI> And they had
thirdly such <HI>Tongues,</HI> as to <HI>indue</HI> them with <HI>ut|terance:
more</HI> than which may be possibly, but
<HI>less</HI> than which cannot be meant by their mira|culous
way of speaking, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>not
as the Flesh, but as the spirit gave them utterance.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 8. Thus at last I have put an end to the
tedious beginning of my Design. A beginning
<PB N="311" REF="160">
made up of three preparatory Ingredients, The
<HI>Accommodation,</HI> the <HI>Explication,</HI> and the <HI>Division</HI>
of the Text. The several <HI>links</HI> of that <HI>chain,</HI>
whereof the use is both to <HI>guide</HI> and to <HI>tye</HI> your
Attention to my Discourse. But the Particu|lars
being too many to be dispatch'd in <HI>one</HI> Ser|mon,
(unless that <HI>one</HI> be as <HI>long</HI> as <HI>many,)</HI> I shall
not proportion my Meditations unto the <HI>Ful|ness</HI>
of the <HI>Text,</HI> (from which there flow's to us
a <HI>Sea</HI> of matter,) But to the <HI>scantness</HI> of the
<HI>Time</HI> which is allow'd for this Service.</P>
<P>&sect;. 1. And first for <HI>the Persons here indow'd,</HI>
I must not speak of them in <HI>Thesi,</HI> either at <HI>ran|dome,</HI>
or at <HI>large;</HI> (for that's no more than may
be don on any other Piece of Scripture wherein
the Apostles are barely mention'd;) But I must
handle them in <HI>Hypothesi,</HI> in as much as they re|late
to the <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Context.</HI> As they relate unto
the <HI>Text,</HI> they cannot be <HI>pertinently</HI> consider'd,
unless in one or more of these <HI>three Notions;</HI>
either as <HI>fill'd with the Holy Ghost,</HI> or as <HI>speaking
with other Tongues,</HI> or else as speaking <HI>after the
measure that the Spirit gave them utterance.</HI> But
in reference to the <HI>Context,</HI> they may be perti|nently
consider'd as they relate to the three em|blemes
<PB N="312" REF="161">
the <HI>Wind,</HI> and the <HI>Fire,</HI> and the ap|pearance
of <HI>cloven Tongues.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> referring
unto their <HI>wisdom,</HI> the <HI>second</HI> unto their <HI>Zeal,</HI>
and the <HI>third</HI> to their gift of <HI>utterance.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. And indeed it was but reason that their
<HI>Tongues</HI> should be so <HI>many,</HI> when both their
<HI>Wisdom</HI> and their <HI>Zeal</HI> were so amazingly <HI>great.</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign">, they were not only <HI>sprinkl'd,</HI>
or <HI>overshadow'd,</HI> but <HI>rinst,</HI> and <HI>fill'd</HI> with the
Holy Ghost. In an immediate suit of which,
their <HI>understandings</HI> were so <HI>inlightned</HI> with the

so I purpose to perform it by seven such
steps of Consideration, as will arise without
violence from the peculiar subject of my
Discourse.</P>
<P>First then let us consider, to what <HI>measure</HI><MILESTONE N="I">
of <HI>Perfection</HI> men may possible arrive in a <HI>state
of Frailty.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Appli|cation.</NOTE> The <HI>Apostles</HI> were but men, and yet
were <HI>fill'd with the holy Ghost.</HI> And arguing (as
we may) <HI>ab Actu ad potentiam,</HI> I think we ought
at least to ayme at the <HI>same perfection.</HI> I am sure
St. <HI>Paul pray'd</HI> for no lesser blessing on his <HI>E|phesians,</HI>
than that they might be <HI>fill'd with the
Fulnesse of God;</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> with <HI>All</HI> the
Fulnesse. <HI>(Eph.</HI> 3, 19.) which cannot signifie <HI>lesse</HI>
than being <HI>perfected</HI> and advanc't to the <HI>highest
pitch</HI> of <HI>Christianity,</HI> which God in Christ can
exact of so <HI>frail a Nature.</HI> And whatsoever we
may <HI>pray for,</HI> we must <HI>indeavour</HI> to <HI>attain</HI> too.
Not contenting our selves, that we are <HI>mettle</HI>
good enough for an <HI>Iron Age;</HI> that we are Chri|stians
well to passe, <HI>as the world goes</HI> good e|nough
<HI>to serve turn;</HI> or no worse than <HI>other men,</HI>
<PB N="324" REF="167">
who are without peradventure in a <HI>savable state;</HI>
or perhaps that we are <HI>better</HI> than a great num|ber
of our Neighbours, who never dye, or are
<HI>buried,</HI> but <HI>in sure and certain hope of a Resurre|ction.</HI>
And yet how many are thus <HI>witty,</HI> in
<HI>smoothing</HI> out their way to <HI>eternal Ruin?</HI> How
many do <HI>please</HI> themselves to <HI>Hell,</HI> with a san|guin
Belief they are <HI>sure of Heaven?</HI> And live
as if they were <HI>afraid,</HI> to be any whit better
than they <HI>must needs?</HI> whereas it is not only the
<HI>Interest,</HI> but the strict <HI>Duty</HI> of a Christian, to
<HI>pant</HI> and <HI>presse</HI> after <HI>Perfection;</HI> never to think he
is <HI>good enough,</HI> until he is <HI>as good</HI> as <HI>Grace</HI> can
<HI>make</HI> him; not to <HI>cleanse himself only from all
kind of filthiness of flesh and Spirit,</HI> but withal
<HI>to perfect holinesse in the fear of God, 2 Cor.</HI> 7. 1.
We must not <HI>Grow in grace</HI> only, but we must
<HI>never leave growing until we come to a perfect man,</HI>
to the measure of the stature of <HI>the fulnesse of
Christ. (Eph.</HI> 4. 17.) This is to be <HI>fill'd with the
holy Ghost,</HI> and <HI>inwardly</HI> to be fill'd with his
<HI>saving Graces;</HI> not, as They in my Text, with
his <HI>outward Gifts.</HI> Those indeed we neither
<HI>have,</HI> nor are bound to <HI>hope</HI> for.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"> And yet although we fall <HI>short</HI> of that <HI>other

be to <HI>Us,</HI> of <HI>all men living,</HI> if we make it not

as the <HI>Laity,</HI> in his <HI>Sanctifying Graces;</HI> But, in

too. Not a <HI>good Living,</HI> or a <HI>great Dignity,</HI> or

of <HI>Gifts,</HI> but they doe not <HI>edifie.</HI> Noe, the <HI>Gifts</HI>
which we must have, to prove our <HI>receiving
the Holy Ghost,</HI> (and that we were not made

should <HI>distinguish</HI> us from the <HI>Laity,</HI> and shew
the <HI>Divinity</HI> of our <HI>Function,</HI> are to be some
of that <HI>Catalogue</HI> which Saint <HI>Paul</HI> gave to
his <HI>Corinthians.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> If not the <HI>greatest</HI> in the Cata|logue,

the <HI>gift of Healing,</HI> and <HI>working Miracles,</HI>
yet at least the <HI>gift of Prophesie,</HI> that is, of <HI>Prea|ching</HI>
and <HI>applying the word of God.</HI> Or if not
<HI>the word of Wisdom,</HI> which is the gift of <HI>speaking</HI>
Mysteries, yet at least <HI>the word of Knowledge,</HI>
which is the <HI>gift</HI> of <HI>understanding</HI> and <HI>unfolding</HI>
them to <HI>others.</HI> A <HI>Gift</HI> we <HI>must have,</HI> whereby
to demonstrate that we are <HI>Gifts.</HI> For He that
<HI>ascended up on high, and led Captivity Captive,</HI> is
immediately said to have <HI>given Gifts unto men.</HI>
And then it follows by way of Instance, that
<HI>He gave some Apostles; some Prophets; some
Evangelists; some Pastors and Doctors. Not Do|ctors</HI>
by an <HI>Antiphrasis,</HI> &agrave; <HI>non docendo,</HI> (that's an
<HI>ill</HI> Derivation,) much less <HI>Pastors</HI> &agrave; <HI>tondendo,</HI>
(for that is <HI>worse,)</HI> no nor <HI>Pastors</HI> &agrave; <HI>pascendo,</HI> as
it is a <HI>Verb Neuter,</HI> (that's worst of all;) But
<HI>Pastors</HI> &agrave; <HI>pascendo,</HI> as it is a <HI>Verb Active.</HI> For
none were <HI>then</HI> allow'd the <HI>Priviledge</HI> to <HI>sheer</HI>
the <HI>Sheep,</HI> who could not <HI>prove</HI> they had the
<HI>Gift,</HI> as well to <HI>feed,</HI> as to <HI>defend</HI> them. And
the reason of it is render'd by the Great <HI>Doctor
of the Gentiles,</HI> 1 Cor. 12. 7. <HI>The manifestation of
the Spirit, is given to every man to profit withal;
<GAP DESC="foreign">, to that which is of some Benefit and Ad|vantage</HI>
to the Church. <HI>That</HI> is it by which <HI>the
<PB N="327" REF="168">

without a <HI>Gift,</HI> a kind of <HI>Lay-Priests,</HI> or <HI>Secu|lar

the <HI>use</HI> and <HI>benefit</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> (like <HI>Talents

from the <HI>Spirit of God.</HI></P>
<P>It was not so with our <HI>Apostles;</HI> who having <MILESTONE N="III">
here received <HI>Talents,</HI> did immediately <HI>negotiate</HI>
and <HI>Traffick</HI> with them. No sooner were they
<HI>fill'd with the Holy Ghost,</HI> but (as it follows in

when 'tis said by the <HI>Bishop</HI> to the <HI>Priest</HI> in his
Ordination, <HI>Receive the Holy Ghost,</HI> it presently
follows in the charge, <HI>Be thou a faithful Dis|penser
of the Word of God and his holy Sacraments.</HI>
Then follows a Prayer for all the Persons who
are Ordain'd, <HI>That the word spoken by their mouths
may have such success, as that it may never be spo|ken
in vain.</HI> Now (not to reflect on any person
in Authority, whose time is taken up in <HI>greater,</HI>

after <HI>Moses,</HI> was the <HI>most Learned</HI> and the <HI>most
eloquent</HI> of all the Prophets, so his best use of
<HI>both,</HI> was to <HI>speak a word in Season to</HI> any Soul
that should want it in any kind. And this is
certainly the <HI>Trade</HI> we are all to <HI>drive,</HI> because
for this end especially we were <HI>bound over</HI> unto

we must study to make it <HI>serve,</HI> and not to <HI>rule</HI>
us; And we must study to make it serve, not for

There are Tongues that are <HI>cloven</HI> even by him
that is known by his <HI>cloven Feet.</HI> And there are
<HI>Tongues set on fire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">James 3. 6.</NOTE> not from <HI>Heaven,</HI> but of <HI>Hell.</HI>
<PB N="333" REF="171">
such is the <HI>cloven</HI> and <HI>fiery Tongue,</HI> wherewith a

by skill in <HI>Arabick,</HI> or <HI>Hebrew,</HI> in <HI>Coptick,</HI> or <HI>Sy|riack,</HI>

'tis still the <HI>worse;</HI> because by so much the abler
<HI>to set on fire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jam. 3. 6.</NOTE> the Course of Nature.</HI> 'Tis never e|nough
to be deplor'd, (and in this place especi|ally,)
That since the <HI>Iesuits</HI> and their <HI>Apes</HI>
have made use of their Tongues to <HI>conceal</HI> their
<HI>meanings,</HI> (which by <HI>God</HI> were intended to lay
<HI>them open,)</HI> a sadder <HI>confusion</HI> hath been made
of the <HI>distinctest Languages and Tongues,</HI> than
that which was given for a <HI>Defeat</HI> at the <HI>Tower
of Babel.</HI> St. <HI>Iames</HI> does put such a <HI>stresse</HI> upon
it, as if on the <HI>Tip</HI> of a mans <HI>Tongue</HI> stood all
<HI>Religion.</HI> For let his <HI>Almes</HI> be never so great,
his <HI>Fastings</HI> never so many, his <HI>Prayers</HI> never so
<HI>long,</HI> and <HI>other Actions</HI> never so <HI>specious,</HI> yet
<HI>if he bridleth not his Tongue</HI> from injurious <HI>Ca|lumnies</HI>
and <HI>falshoods,</HI> He is a man either of
<HI>none,</HI> or a <HI>vain Religion. (Iam.</HI> 1. 26.) The
reason of which is very evident. For a <HI>lye</HI> stand|ing
<HI>singly,</HI> is Breach of <HI>Truth;</HI> and joyn'd to
<HI>witnesse,</HI> is Breach of <HI>Iustice;</HI> and referring to
<HI>Neighbour,</HI> is Breach of <HI>Charity.</HI> And by the

Breach of <HI>all three,</HI> down goes <HI>Religion.</HI> If it
is flatly <HI>contumelious,</HI> (or but by way of <HI>obtrecta|tion,)</HI>
it is not nakedly a lye, but an arrant <HI>slan|der;</HI>
which, if maliciously committed, and so
committed by a Person whose <HI>knowledge</HI> is <HI>great,</HI>
and his <HI>Calling sacred,</HI> makes the <HI>Top</HI> of that

<HI>climb'd</HI> to <HI>Ruin.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="VI"> Now for the <HI>Cure</HI> of this in some, and for
the <HI>Prevention</HI> of it in <HI>others,</HI> presse we our
selves to an <HI>Improvement</HI> of the <HI>next</HI> observa|ble
in the Text. For the Apostles, being <HI>fill'd
with the holy Ghost,</HI> did not only <HI>begin to speak,</HI>
and to speak <HI>with Tongues,</HI> but <GAP DESC="foreign">, with
<HI>other</HI> Tongues. I mean not only in the <HI>literal,</HI>
but <HI>moral</HI> sense of that word. For St. <HI>Peter</HI>
who had spoken with <HI>a Tongue of Tergiversa|tion,</HI>
by <HI>denying</HI> and <HI>forswearing</HI> his master <HI>Christ,</HI>
did now at last begin to speak with <HI>another
Tongue;</HI> a Tongue that <HI>honour'd</HI> him, and <HI>own'd</HI>
him, and <HI>preach't</HI> him <HI>up</HI> to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Math. 16. 15.</NOTE> <HI>every Creature.</HI>
This alone was the <HI>change</HI> that <HI>enrich't</HI> his <HI>mouth.</HI>
Not his <HI>wonderful Ability</HI> to speak in all sorts
of <HI>Language,</HI> but his <HI>Preaching</HI> of the <HI>Gospell</HI> in
<HI>every one.</HI> Many <HI>Gracelesse</HI> men have <HI>Tongues</HI>
wherewith they speak as they are prompted by
<PB N="335" REF="172">
<HI>learned Heads,</HI> But <HI>His</HI> was prompted by an
<HI>honest</HI> and <HI>Zealous Heart too.</HI> There are that
come to the <HI>University,</HI> who without either <HI>study,</HI>
or <HI>Inspiration,</HI> do learn to speak <HI>with other
Tongues;</HI> Yet I cannot say with <HI>more,</HI> much
lesse with <HI>better,</HI> but with Tongues much <HI>worse</HI>
than they did before. Nor is there any where
so <HI>sad,</HI> and so <HI>deplorable</HI> a Spectacle, as that
which sometimes appeares in this <HI>House of
Prayer;</HI> when in the <HI>solemnest Assembly</HI> of all the
Year, a <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God</HI> shall be so transform'd into
the absolute <HI>Guise</HI> of a <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>Belial,</HI> as to <HI>de|spise
his own Soul,</HI> in the <HI>defiling</HI> of <HI>Himselfe</HI> and
the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> by an applauded <HI>Defamati|on</HI>
of his <HI>Superiours;</HI> by subjecting them to the
<HI>Contumelies</HI> and <HI>Asperities</HI> of his <HI>Tongue,</HI> which
is not only the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jam. 3. 8. Ibid. v. 6.</NOTE> <HI>unruliest,</HI> but in <HI>that</HI> case also,
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jam. 3. 8. Ibid. v. 6.</NOTE> <HI>filthiest</HI> member of his Body. In such a
place as this is, It were to be wish't that men
would <HI>speak</HI> with other <HI>Tongues</HI> than those
are; even with <HI>Tongues</HI> which may demonstrate,
if not that they are <HI>fill'd,</HI> yet at least that
they are <HI>Season'd,</HI> and not quite <HI>void</HI> of the
<HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> And here I <HI>cannot,</HI> I <HI>dare</HI> not
forbear to say, (to as many as <HI>fear God,</HI> and
are <HI>afraid</HI> to <HI>fear men</HI> in this Congregation,)
<PB N="336" REF="173">
That when a <HI>Cato</HI> shall have been able to keep
a <HI>Zanie</HI> more in awe on a <HI>Heathen Theatre,</HI> than
<HI>many Doctors</HI> now can in a <HI>Christian Church;</HI>
when under one and the same Roof, <HI>Dagon</HI> is
coupl'd with the <HI>Ark, Iehovah</HI> with <HI>Mercury,</HI>
The <HI>Pulpit</HI> with the <HI>Stage,</HI> and <HI>Divinity</HI> with
<HI>Prophaneness;</HI> It will become as many of us,
as are not only <HI>Followers,</HI> but <HI>Embassadours</HI> of
Christ, even to imitate his Example, who <HI>beat
the Hucksters out of the Temple,</HI> by our well
meant Indeavours to <HI>whip the Scoffers out of the
Church.</HI> And if <HI>He</HI> used a <HI>Rod</HI> of <HI>Cords,</HI> well
may <HI>we</HI> use one of <HI>Scorpions.</HI> Because <HI>Propha|nesse</HI>
in a <HI>Christian</HI> is very much <HI>worse</HI> than in
a <HI>Iew;</HI> and <HI>This</HI> withall a <HI>worse Prophanenesse.</HI>
Such scandalous Sins as are but <HI>chargable</HI> to
<HI>others,</HI> are in reason to be <HI>punish't</HI> with greater
<HI>pungency</HI> in <HI>Us;</HI> In as much as being <HI>Priests,</HI> we
<HI>have received the holy Ghost;</HI> So that we Sin,
when we Sin, against <HI>greater Light,</HI> and against
greater <HI>Obligations</HI> to <HI>cease</HI> from <HI>Sinning.</HI> We
do the <HI>Devil</HI> greater <HI>Service</HI> by the <HI>Impurity</HI> of
our <HI>Lives,</HI> than we can possibly do <HI>God</HI> by our
<HI>purest Doctrins.</HI> When <HI>secular</HI> Jews were muti|neers
against the <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Priest,</HI> (for <HI>Moses</HI>
and <HI>Aaron</HI> were nothing else,) God Almighty
<PB N="337" REF="173">
was so <HI>patient,</HI> as to punish them by <HI>Degrees.</HI>
But when <HI>Corah</HI> and the rest of the <HI>holy Tribe</HI>
began to speak against their Governours, the
<HI>Earth</HI> could no longer indure to <HI>bear</HI> them; The
<HI>Heavens</HI> could no longer indure their <HI>sight;</HI> and
<HI>Hell</HI> could no longer sustein their <HI>Absence.</HI>
Then let all of <HI>this</HI> Place, which was intended by
God and our pious Founders, for a Nursery of
<HI>Vertue,</HI> as well as <HI>Learning, addict Themselves,</HI>
and <HI>prevail</HI> with <HI>others,</HI> to speak henceforward
with <HI>other Tongues</HI> than they were wont. Let
them that have spoken either with <HI>wanton,</HI> or
<HI>slanderous</HI> Tongues, now speak with <HI>Tongues</HI>
that are <HI>modest,</HI> and <HI>void of malice.</HI> For if <HI>Luther,</HI>

<P><MILESTONE N="VII"> Which to the end that we may do, we are

<HI>the wrath of God cometh upon the Children of Dis|obedience.</HI>
No, In all our <HI>solemn meetings,</HI> e|specially
<HI>Then</HI> when we tread in <HI>God's Courts,</HI>
we ought to speak <GAP DESC="foreign">, so as not to <HI>disgrace,</HI>

not to <HI>gratifie</HI> the <HI>Itch</HI> of ungracious <HI>men,</HI> but
to <HI>trumpet out</HI> the <HI>wonderfull works of God.</HI> That
they who cannot indure to <HI>think</HI> we can be e|minently

we are <HI>serious</HI> Christians. And since <HI>St. Iames</HI>

<P>And this has ever been the <HI>Rule</HI> (I mean

for a <HI>Temple,</HI> to that of <HI>Solomon,</HI> and for a
<HI>Ritual,</HI> to that of <HI>Moses,</HI> as having <HI>both</HI> been
prescribed by <HI>God himself.</HI> And yet we know
the Prophet <HI>Haggai</HI> made the people <HI>steep</HI>

<PB N="361" REF="185">
The holy Prophets in the Old Testament,

<HEAD>A Paraenesis to the Reader, touching the Sermon
going before, and the Discourse which follows
after of Rome's pretended Infallibility.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. 1. SInce the Time wherein this Sermon
was first commanded into the light, It
has been <HI>scoff't</HI> at by <HI>some,</HI> and easily <HI>rail'd</HI> at by
<HI>others,</HI> and by a third sort <HI>complain'd of,</HI> as the
<HI>Concause</HI> at least of a <HI>Persecution.</HI> But so far has
it been from being <HI>enfeebled,</HI> or <HI>refuted,</HI> that 'tis
more than I know if it has <HI>manfully</HI> been <HI>op|pos'd.</HI>
So that to <HI>Vindicate</HI> my Sermon, I need
no more than to <HI>Reprint</HI> it, (as I was told by an
Acute and Learned Prelate,) If aequal Readers
will but have patience both to <HI>examin</HI> what I
have said, and to <HI>compare</HI> it with the All that is
said against it. Which if they will not do <HI>Now,</HI>
whilst the Dispute is at the <HI>shortest,</HI> and whilst
they may do it with <HI>greatest Ease;</HI> how much
<HI>less</HI> would they have patience for such a due
<PB N="396" REF="202">
examination, if an <HI>Inlargement</HI> of the Conten|tion
should make their Task the more <HI>tedious?</HI>
And if they <HI>will;</HI> All the <HI>stones</HI> which certain
Enemies have hurled at it in the Dark, will
(being happily laid together) make but a <HI>Mo|nument</HI>
of the Truth of that well-meant-Sermon.
That famous saying of <HI>Callimachus,</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign">, I have found to be as True, as
it was long ago Notorious. And when <HI>Con|troversies</HI>
especially are improved into Volumes
both Great and Many, Men of Poverty can|not
<HI>buy,</HI> and men of Business cannot <HI>read</HI> them;
and even men of most <HI>leisure</HI> cannot so <HI>grasp</HI>
them as they ought, unless their <HI>Memories</HI> are
as strong as their <HI>Attentions</HI> are to be steady, and
the stock of their <HI>Patience</HI> as great as either.
This the oftner I observe, and the longer I lay
to heart, the more I am fixed in my choise, to
serve and satisfie my Readers (as far at least as
I am able) touching the Business I am about,
at the <HI>least expense</HI> possible of Time, and Mony.
For if my Essay is <HI>Convincing,</HI> It is the <HI>better</HI>
for being <HI>short;</HI> And if it is otherwise, 'twould
be the <HI>worse</HI> if it were <HI>longer.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. If the Citations of my Sermon, in
which I was ingaged by just Autority, (by the
<PB N="397" REF="202">
Dean of the Kings Chappel, for the Penning, &amp;
Preaching, as well as by the King Himself, for
the Printing of it,) are but as free from all fraud
as I <HI>say</HI> they are, and as every willing Reader
has been enabled by me to <HI>prove</HI> with the least
pains possible, I have attain'd my whole end,
and my <HI>work</HI> is don. For as my <HI>end</HI> was to dis|cover
the real <HI>Novelty</HI> of the <HI>Doctrins,</HI> and the
<HI>depravednesse</HI> of the <HI>Practices,</HI> in which our
Church cannot joyn with the Church of Rome,
and which have made the Separation 'twixt
Us, and Them; So my <HI>work</HI> was to prove it
by the <HI>Confession</HI> of <HI>Themselves;</HI> I mean of such
as are their Learned'st and Partial'st Writers.

<HI>without,</HI> or <HI>against</HI> their own Knowledge, that
the <HI>Citations I</HI> insist on are false, or frivolous,
there needs no other vindication than my Affir|ming
them to be <HI>True,</HI> and <HI>Material</HI> also. And
this is ready to be attested by several <HI>Witnesses</HI>
<PB N="398" REF="203">
of <HI>Fact</HI> who have made exact <HI>Searches,</HI> at <HI>my In|treaty.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 3. Indeed there is one of my Citations,
(and but one that I know of,) which though as
innocent, and as exact, as any Citation ever was,
does seem to stand in some need of a Vidicati|on.
Not for the satifying or shaming a wilful
Papist, who for want of due Knowledge, or of
sufficient Ingenuity, shall at any time accuse
both It, and Me; But for the sake of some weak
and unwary Protestants, whose great unkind|nesse
to my Person has made them Maligners
of my Cause too; And who had rather their
own Religion should some way suffer, than that
a Person whom they envy should any way pro|sper
in its Defense. The one Citation I am to
vindicate is in the Sixt Page of my Sermon,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Joh. Sa|risbur. Poly|crat. <HI>Either printed at Leyden A. D. 1595. Or</HI> in Biblioth. Pa|tr. Colon. A|grip. 1622. p. 427. Col. 1.</NOTE> and
tis out of the <HI>Polycraticum</HI> of <HI>Iohannes Sarisbu|riensis,</HI>
(a learned Bishop who did flourish al|most
500 years ago,) l. 6. c. 24 p. 329. Edit,
Lugd. Bat. 1595. Where though 'tis granted
<HI>The Church of Rome was said to shew Her-self a
Step-Mother,</HI> and <HI>Scribes and Pharisees were also
said to sit in her;</HI> Yet I am branded with un|sincere
and unhansome dealing, because the
words were not spoken by the good Bishop to
<PB N="399" REF="203">
the Pope, as from <HI>Himself,</HI> or as his <HI>own</HI> sense
and meaning, But as received from many <HI>others,</HI>
and which himself had heard spoken in <HI>divers
Provinces.</HI> To which I answer by these de|grees.
First that I never did once pretend the
words were spoken by the Bishop, much less
that they were spoken as his peculiar sense and
meaning. But having us'd the word <HI>Pharisees</HI>
in the Body of my Discourse, and apply'd it to
the men of the Roman Church, I only noted in
the Margin, where the word might be found in
the sense I gave it. Meaning no more by it than
This, That I was not the <HI>first</HI> who had so ap|ply'd
it, but that I had it from the men of their
own Communion, and such as used such lan|guage
long enough <HI>before Luther.</HI> Next 'tis clear
that my Citation was not brought by way of
<HI>proof,</HI> (though 'twas a <HI>proof</HI> of my Candor in
the use of that word,) but rather by way of
<HI>Accommodation.</HI> Else I had noted both how <HI>com|monly,</HI>
and how <HI>loudly</HI> the word was us'd; it
being most for my Interest, and for the Credit
of my Cause, to make it appear that it was us'd
rather by <HI>many,</HI> than by <HI>one;</HI> nor only in <HI>one,</HI> but
in <HI>many places.</HI> So that mine Enemies should
have <HI>thank't</HI> my love of Brevity in a Margin,
<PB N="400" REF="204">
which would not suffer me to be fond of my
<HI>whole</HI> Advantage. For (Thirdly) had I pursued
it, as very prosperously I might, I might have
added that That Censure (fixt on the Pope and
the Cardinals, and the Roman Church in ge|neral,)
was not only <HI>Vox<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Haec inquam Pater, loqui|tur Populus, &amp;c.</NOTE> Populi,</HI> (which of it

From whence it follows unavoidably, that
Mr. <HI>Cressy</HI> must not dare to avow this <HI>last</HI> no|tion
of <HI>The present Visible Church;</HI> as well be|cause
it is not <HI>That,</HI> to which he dares say <HI>the

easily declare her sense in another way, than as she
was ever represented by her Pastors out of all Na|tions,
that is to say, by a General Council,</HI> which
yet <HI>the present visible Church can never do,</HI> saith
Mr. <HI>Cressy,</HI> chap. 9. p. 95. But when I say, he
must not dare to avow this <HI>last</HI> notion of the
<HI>present visible Church,</HI> to which he gives the <HI>last
Recourse,</HI> and to which he ascribes <HI>Infallibility:</HI>
I mean, he must not <HI>for the future,</HI> not but that
<HI>for the present</HI> he dares to do it; Because he tells
us expressly, <HI>p.</HI> 97. (&amp; as <HI>dogmatically</HI> too, as with|out
all <HI>proof,) That the present Superiours living
and speaking must conclude all controversies, their
Interpretation of Scripture and Fathers, their Testi|mony
of Tradition, must more than put to silence all
contradiction of particular persons, or Churches;
it must also subdue their minds to an Assent, and
this under the penalty of an Anathema, or cutting off
from the body of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="208">&sect;. 10. This is said by M. <HI>Cressy</HI> concerning
the <HI>living</HI> and <HI>speaking Iudges of his Church,</HI>
Judges for the time being in every Age. Quite
<HI>forgetting</HI> what he had said not long before, <HI>p.</HI> 95.
That <HI>Reason, Inspiration,</HI> and <HI>Examples of Pri|mitive
Fathers,</HI> must <HI>joyntly</HI> make up the <HI>only
Guide,</HI> which <HI>He affirms to be Infallible. For,
unless they all concur,</HI> (as he had said before that,
<HI>p.</HI> 93,) <HI>together with the present visible Governours,</HI>
(to whom he there gives <HI>a judging determining
power,) That which we take to be Reason, and In|spiration,
and the sense of the Primitive Church,
may deceive and misguide us.</HI> Now besides that
<HI>This</HI> saying destroys the <HI>former,</HI> where no less
was ascrib'd to the <HI>present visible Superiours liv|ing
and speaking,</HI> than here is attributed to <HI>All
four Requisites in conjunction;</HI> we know that
<HI>Reason</HI> may be <HI>deceiv'd, Inspiration</HI> be <HI>counterfeit</HI>
by some <HI>unclean spirit,</HI> (which fallible Reason
must be the Judge of,) primitive <HI>Fathers</HI> subject
to <HI>Error,</HI> and <HI>present</HI> Superiours much more
than <HI>Primitive:</HI> And, <HI>many fallible</HI> Guides can
never make up <HI>one Infallible,</HI> any more than
<HI>many Planets</HI> can make <HI>one Sun,</HI> or <HI>many Acts</HI>
of finite <HI>knowledge</HI> one true <HI>omniscience.</HI> For as
Mr. <HI>Cressy</HI> does confess, that <HI>Infallibility</HI> and
<PB N="409" REF="208">
<HI>Omniscience, are incommunicable Attributes of God
Himself, (p.</HI> 98.) so he imply's a <HI>contradiction,</HI>
when he saith they are <HI>communicable</HI> to any <HI>crea|ture,</HI>
such as is his <HI>present visible Church.</HI> And
<HI>another</HI> contradiction as bad, or worse, when he
saith that <HI>a man, although of much Ignorance, may
in a sort be Omniscient within his sphere,</HI> (p. 99.)
which is as if he should have said, That a man
may be <HI>able</HI> to have a <HI>knowledge of All things,</HI>
because he may <HI>so know</HI> them <HI>All,</HI> as to be <HI>Igno|rant</HI>
of <HI>Some.</HI> But then, with the help of that
<GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>meanest man</HI> is as <HI>omniscient,</HI> as is
his <HI>Roman Catholick Church;</HI> because (within
his <HI>determinate sphere)</HI> he must needs have a
<HI>knowledge</HI> of <HI>All</HI> he <HI>know's;</HI> and of <HI>more</HI> than she
<HI>know's</HI> the <HI>Roman Church</HI> hath <HI>no knowledge.</HI> So
again when he would shew how a <HI>creature</HI> may
be <HI>Infallible,</HI> though he had said that God
Himself is <HI>incommunicably such,</HI> (p. 98.) he has
no better a <GAP DESC="foreign">, than an implicit explication
of an <HI>Affirmative</HI> by a <HI>Negative. The immutable
God can preserve mutable creatures from actual
mutation;</HI> [ibid.] thereby implying, that <HI>the Im|mutable</HI>
cannot <HI>communicate</HI> his <HI>incommunicable</HI>
Attribute of <HI>Immutability</HI> to any <HI>creature,</HI> even
because he cannot possibly <HI>perfect</HI> a <HI>creature</HI> into
<PB N="410" REF="209">
<HI>Himself.</HI> But from <HI>actual mutation</HI> he can pre|serve
<HI>any</HI> Creature, as well an <HI>Ignorant single
man,</HI> as a <HI>whole Church Catholick.</HI> Thus by en|deavouring
to uphold, Mr. <HI>Cressy</HI> does throughly
<HI>Destroy</HI> his Doctrine: All he saith coming to
this, That however <HI>God only</HI> is <HI>Undeceivable,</HI>
yet he is able to preserve his <HI>deceivable creatures</HI>
from being <HI>actually deceiv'd. Sed quid hoc ad
Iphicli Boves?</HI> The Question is not, Whether
God can preserve a <HI>Chruch</HI> from being <HI>actually
in error,</HI> (for so he <HI>can,</HI> and often <HI>does, particular
Members</HI> of his Church,) But whether <HI>de facto</HI>
he hath granted an <HI>Inerrability,</HI> or an <HI>Impossibility</HI>
of <HI>erring,</HI> unto that which they call the <HI>Roman
Catholick Church.</HI> Not whether the Church is
<HI>actually false</HI> in her opinions, but whether
or no she is <HI>Infallible,</HI> or exempted by God
from the <HI>passive power</HI> of giving <HI>false</HI> Judgment
in points of Faith. Will Mr. <HI>Cressy</HI> so confound
an <HI>Adjective</HI> in <HI>Bilis,</HI> with a <HI>Participle</HI> derived
from the passive <HI>preterperfest Tense,</HI> as either to
argue &agrave; <HI>non actu ad non potentiam,</HI> or else to pass
over from the <HI>one</HI> unto the <HI>other?</HI> Will he ar|gue
that <HI>Adam</HI> before his fall was <HI>Impeccable,</HI>
because he yet was preserved from <HI>actual sin?</HI>
or, that the <HI>Church</HI> was <HI>Infallible</HI> in the <HI>Apostles</HI>

own <HI>Times,</HI> because she <HI>was not</HI> erroneous until

<P>Now if a <HI>Council</HI> (as the <HI>Lateran)</HI> does only
<HI>Read</HI> a Decree <HI>in Fieri,</HI> And a <HI>Pope</HI> (as the

it be <HI>called</HI> by the <HI>Pope,</HI> and by the <HI>Pope praesided

until the <HI>Pope</HI> hath <HI>approved</HI> of it, or until <HI>he</HI>
hath made it become <HI>Authentick</HI> by an <HI>Act of his
Will,</HI> or by a <HI>word</HI> of his <HI>Mouth;</HI> Mr. <HI>Cressy,</HI>
and Father <HI>Iohnson,</HI> who do so earnestly contend
for a <HI>subcoelestial Infallability,</HI> cannot chuse but
<HI>believe,</HI> (if at all they <HI>believe,</HI> as well as <HI>plead</HI> it,)
That its real <HI>Inherence</HI> is in the <HI>Pope,</HI> and only
<HI>said</HI> to be in the <HI>Church,</HI> because it does more
<HI>become</HI> the Error, and <HI>set it off</HI> to the People with
<HI>better Grace.</HI> The <HI>Reason</HI> of what I say is very
<HI>cogent in it self;</HI> and that it may be so to <HI>others,</HI>
I thus endeavour to make it <HI>plain.</HI> They say
<PB N="417" REF="212">
that <HI>Councils</HI> are not <HI>currant,</HI> unless <HI>approved</HI> of
by the <HI>Pope.</HI> Nor does he give his <HI>Approbation,</HI>
until the <HI>Council</HI> is at an <HI>end.</HI> His <HI>Approbation</HI>
is <HI>after;</HI> and not <HI>before</HI> it. From whence 'tis
natural to Inferr, That he <HI>approve's</HI> not of the
<HI>Council,</HI> because <HI>Infallibly good</HI> and therefore <HI>cur|rant;</HI>
(it would not then <HI>need</HI> his <HI>Approbation:)</HI>
But the <HI>Council</HI> is <HI>good</HI> and <HI>currant,</HI> because He
<HI>approve's</HI> it. And why should <HI>That</HI> be <HI>said,</HI>
unless because He is <HI>Infallible</HI> with <HI>Them</HI> that
<HI>say</HI> it? Thus (I say) it is to <HI>Them,</HI> not Thus
in <HI>It selfe.</HI> For then there would follow this
other Absurdity, That if The <HI>Council</HI> hath
<HI>err'd,</HI> it is because the <HI>Pope</HI> hath <HI>not approv'd</HI> it.
For let him but <HI>approve,</HI> and It hath <HI>not err'd,</HI>
because it hath every thing required to its <HI>In|fallibility.</HI>
If not, let them speak; for I argue
only <HI>ad homines,</HI> and (out of very great charity)
try to make them <HI>asham'd</HI> with their own <HI>De|vices.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 14. Now (to speak a gross Truth,) The
<HI>Approbation</HI> of a <HI>Pope,</HI> when a <HI>Council</HI> hath <HI>don</HI>
with its <HI>Consultations,</HI> cannot possibly have the
virtue to effect that <HI>such</HI> a <HI>Council</HI> shall <HI>not have
err'd.</HI> For if it hath erred it is <HI>erroneous,</HI> though
He <HI>approve's</HI> it. If not, it is <HI>orthodox,</HI> though
<PB N="418" REF="213">
He <HI>rejects it.</HI> The <HI>Emperours</HI> who call'd <HI>the

<HI>Those</HI> were <HI>the Councils,</HI> either <HI>not erring at all,</HI>
or at least the <HI>least erring</HI> of any other.</P>
<P>&sect;. 15. But let us yield Mr. <HI>Cressy</HI> yet more
Advantage, and suppose him only to <HI>mean</HI> what
<HI>once</HI> he <HI>saith,</HI> (for he saith so <HI>many</HI> things, that

<HI>This</HI> only is <HI>the Church,</HI> to which he ascribes
<HI>Infallibility.</HI> To which <HI>I</HI> answer, by two De|grees.
First by observing, that he takes for
<HI>granted</HI> what is <HI>false.</HI> For there was never <HI>such</HI>
a <HI>Council,</HI> as to which <HI>All Nations</HI> did send their
<HI>Pastors,</HI> and by consequence The <HI>Church</HI> was
never <HI>so Represented;</HI> and by consequence <HI>never
Infallible,</HI> if She can only be <HI>Infallible</HI> when
<HI>so Represented,</HI> to wit, by the <HI>Pastors</HI> of <HI>All Na|tions</HI>
which have <HI>Christian Churches</HI> in them.
For, the first four <HI>General</HI> Councils were not
<HI>such</HI> in <HI>That</HI> sense; And only were called <HI>Oe|cumenical,</HI>
not for <HI>Bellarmine's</HI> Reason, but be|cause
they consisted of all the <HI>Pastors</HI> who were
<PB N="419" REF="213">
sent from <HI>Those Nations</HI> which made up <HI>all the
Roman Empire,</HI> whose <HI>Emperours</HI> (by a <HI>figure)</HI>
were call'd <HI>the Masters of the world.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Concil. Chal. Act. 1. Bin. To. 3. p. 50.</NOTE> Beyond
the limits of the <HI>Empire, None</HI> of those, or after-<HI>Councils,</HI>
did ever reach. None went thither out
of <HI>Persia, India,</HI> the <HI>Inmost Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Aethiopia,</HI>
wherein the <HI>Churches</HI> were never under the <HI>Ro|man
Empire;</HI> Nor yet out of <HI>Britain, France,</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> when, being parted from the Em|pire,
They became the <HI>Peculiar</HI> of <HI>other Prin|ces.</HI>
And as the <HI>Empire</HI> grew <HI>scanty,</HI> so the
<HI>Councils</HI> in proportion did grow less <HI>General.</HI>
Whose <HI>Greatness</HI> is to be <HI>measur'd, not</HI> by
the <HI>number</HI> of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> but by the <HI>multi|tude</HI>
of the <HI>Churches,</HI> and by the <HI>Greatnesse</HI> of
the <HI>Regions</HI> from which they come. But since
the <HI>Bishops of Rome,</HI> with <HI>other Rights</HI> of the <HI>Ro|man
Empire,</HI> have invaded <HI>This</HI> also, of <HI>calling</HI>
and <HI>praesiding</HI> in General Councils, they have
been only <HI>call'd General,</HI> for being a <HI>Confluence</HI>
of <HI>Pastors</HI> out of <HI>all the Papal Empire.</HI> And
therefore, according to Mr. <HI>Cressy,</HI> They could
not possibly be <HI>Infallible,</HI> because not <HI>such,</HI> as
to which <HI>All Nations did send their Pastors.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 16. Next I answer by observing that the
learned'st Romanists cannot agree, about the
<PB N="420" REF="214">
<HI>Nature,</HI> or <HI>Number,</HI> of <HI>General Councils.</HI> For,
first as to the <HI>Nature,</HI> The <HI>General Councils</HI> of
the <HI>Romanists</HI> are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Quaedam sunt ab Apo|stolica sede approbata, at|que ab Eccle|si&acirc; univers&acirc; recepta; quae|dam omnino reprobata; quaedam par|tim reprobata, partim appro|bata; quaedam nec approbata, nec reprobata; <HI>Bellarm. ubi sup. p.</HI> 1097.</NOTE> thus divided by themselves;

<HI>each</HI> of these <HI>sorts</HI> is said by Romanists to be <HI>Ge|neral,</HI>
and <HI>General Councils</HI> in the <HI>general</HI> are also
said by <HI>the same</HI> to be <HI>Infallible;</HI> What else do
they say, in <HI>effect</HI> &amp; <HI>substance,</HI> but that the <HI>Church
represented</HI> in <HI>General Councils</HI> is either <HI>absolutely
Infallible,</HI> (as in the <HI>first</HI> species of General

(as in the <HI>fourth.)</HI> If <HI>General</HI> Councils <HI>cannot err,</HI>
Why then do they <HI>reprobate,</HI> or <HI>doubt</HI> any of

having added to them so great a power, that what

any thing to my <HI>self,</HI> by which your <HI>charity doth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 7.</NOTE>

<P>Indeed considering we are fallen, I do not only

(at least had <HI>forgotten</HI> that they are <HI>dying,</HI> and

so fully concur with yours, that even as soon as my
leasure serves me to pay my Readers what I have
promis'd, (that men may learn to <HI>love</HI> God, by
thinking him <HI>free</HI> from their <HI>Impieties,</HI> and may
not reverence their <HI>Impieties,</HI> so far forth as they
think them the <HI>works of God,)</HI> I shall direct my
<HI>whole studies,</HI> as you have charitably advised.
And indeed I am the fitter to take your Counsel,
because I want a fit enemy with whom to combate;
since <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> of the <HI>ablest</HI> have quit the field,
and as it were <HI>bowed</HI> to the <HI>truth</HI> of the things in
question. For though they have lately sent out a

<HI>Teazer,</HI> who (they hoped) might tempt me to <HI>loss
of time,</HI> not by disputing in <HI>any measure</HI> against
a <HI>line</HI> of what I have <HI>publish'd,</HI> but only by <HI>open|ing
a noysome mouth,</HI> in a very <HI>wide manner</HI>

against my<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>He saith expresly, 1.

his <HI>Hands</HI> were <HI>cut off,</HI> he pursued

<HI>No,</HI> to the second, <HI>Nothing.</HI> As for his <HI>blasphe|mies

his frequent <HI>confessions</HI> that he is <HI>ignorant</HI> of
what he presumeth to <HI>affirm,</HI> his impotent <HI>slanders,</HI>
his most unsavoury <HI>scurrilities,</HI> his pique at my
<HI>cassock and my cap,</HI> his evil eye upon my <HI>Re|ctory,</HI>
and <HI>female Readers,</HI> (to the honour of
your sex, and shame of ours,) last of all for his
<HI>impenitency</HI> and <HI>resolutions</HI> to <HI>persevere</HI> in his
<HI>crying sins,)</HI> against That person of all the world,
whom, next to God, and his Parents, he ought
to have had in the greatest reverence,) I shall
leave him to the mercy of one or other of my Dis|ciples;
who being as much <HI>his</HI> Iuniors, as he is
<HI>mine,</HI> may have youth enough to <HI>excuse,</HI> if not
<HI>commend</HI> them, for cooling the courage of so <HI>pru|rient</HI>
and <HI>bold</HI> a Writer. But for my self, I have
determined, so to <HI>profit</HI> by what I Preach in the
following Sermon, as not to leave it in the power
of every petulant undertaker, to dispose of my
hours in <HI>altercation.</HI> They that look to <HI>live long
before they<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Psal. 16. 10.</NOTE> look upon the grave,</HI> may <HI>trifle
out</HI> their <HI>time</HI> with better pretensions to an <HI>excuse;</HI>
but I who have lost so much already, and have had
(as I may say) so many <HI>Trials</HI> for my <HI>Life,</HI> (at
that <HI>Bar</HI> of <HI>Mortality,</HI> the <HI>Bed</HI> of <HI>Sickness,)</HI>
<PB N="442" REF="225">
which makes me consider it as a perishing, and dying
life, cannot think it so much as <HI>lawful,</HI> to <HI>dispute
it away</HI> with an <HI>itching</HI> adversary; who, how|ever
<HI>insufficient</HI> to <HI>hold up</HI> his quarrel, is yet too
<HI>restless</HI> to <HI>lay it down.</HI></P>
<P>But I proceed to that Subject (from which my
thoughts have been kept by a <HI>long parenthesis)</HI>
of which I <HI>love</HI> to be speaking on all occasions that
can be offer'd, because I find so much in it, of
which I cannot but speak <HI>well;</HI> and no less to the
<HI>honour</HI> of his <HI>memory,</HI> than to the <HI>profit</HI> and
<HI>pleasure</HI> of his <HI>survivers.</HI> He was certainly a per|son,
who liv'd a great deal of life in a little time;
especially <HI>dating</HI> it (as he did) from the memora|ble
point of his <HI>renovation.</HI> When I consider him
in his Childhood at the University of <HI>Oxford</HI> (I am
sure some years before you knew him) exciting o|thers
by his <HI>Example,</HI> to mind the <HI>end</HI> of their
being <HI>there;</HI> how <HI>strict</HI> and <HI>studious</HI> he appeared
throughout his course; how much farther he went
<HI>before,</HI> (in point of <HI>standing</HI> and <HI>proficiency,)</HI>
then he came <HI>behind</HI> others, in point of <HI>years;</HI> how
much applauded he was by <HI>all,</HI> for his <HI>publick
Exercises</HI> in Lent, both as an <HI>Oratour</HI> at the
<HI>Desk,</HI> and as a <HI>Philosopher</HI> in the <HI>Schools;</HI> how
(like the brave <HI>Epaminondas)</HI> he <HI>added</HI> honour
<PB N="443" REF="225">
to his <HI>degree,</HI> which yet to <HI>us</HI> (of his form) was
all we were able to <HI>attain;</HI> when I reflect upon his
<HI>progress</HI> through much variety of Learning, through
every part of the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> especially through
<HI>Algebra,</HI> the most <HI>untrodden</HI> part of them; and
when I compare with all this, the great sobriety of
his temper, his unaffected humility, and (after a
publick <HI>aberration)</HI> his perfect <HI>return</HI> into the
<HI>way,</HI> out of which (for some years) he had unhap|pily
been seduced; last of all when I rememember,
how whilst nothing but <HI>prosperity</HI> made some in the
world to <HI>hug</HI> their <HI>errour,</HI> he hated <HI>his</HI> so much
the <HI>more,</HI> the more he had <HI>prosper'd</HI> by its <HI>delu|sion,</HI>
(which was an argument of the most generous
and Christian temper,) I think I may fitly affirm of
<HI>him,</HI> what was said by <HI>Siracides</HI> concerning
<HI>Enoch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisd. 4. 13.</NOTE> that <HI>being made perfect in a short time,
he fulfill'd a long time.</HI></P>
<P>I do the rather think it a <HI>duty,</HI> to praise him af|ter
his <HI>decease,</HI> the less he was able to <HI>endure</HI> it,
whilst yet <HI>alive.</HI> And I conceive my self the fitter,
to speak a little in his <HI>absence</HI> of his <HI>perfections,</HI>
because so long as he was <HI>present,</HI> I only told him
of his <HI>faults.</HI> (Never leaving him as a Monitor,
until I thought he left <HI>them.)</HI> For having found
him my <HI>noble Friend,</HI> and (which in honour to
<PB N="444" REF="226">
his memory, I think it my duty to acknowledge)
my very <HI>munificent Benefactor,</HI> I could not be
so <HI>unkind</HI> a thing, as not to afford him my <HI>repre|hensions,</HI>
(yet still attended with <HI>respect,)</HI> in
whatsoever regard I could think them <HI>useful.</HI> And
'twas the mark of an excellent judicious spirit, that
he valued me <HI>most</HI> for my <HI>greatest freedom</HI> in that
particular. Even <HI>then</HI> when our <HI>heads</HI> were most
at <HI>enmity,</HI> (by the over great influence of his <HI>Fa|ther's</HI>
persuasion upon his own) there still remained
in both our <HI>hearts</HI> a most inviolable <HI>friendship.</HI>
And yet the chiefest instance of <HI>mine,</HI> was only my
often having been <HI>angry</HI> with what I conceived to be
a <HI>sin;</HI> against which (by Gods goodness being suf|ficiently
convinc'd) he grew at last to be as angry,
as <HI>Friends</HI> or <HI>Enemies</HI> could have been. He had
impartially consider'd that sacred Aphorism, that
<HI>to refuse instruction, is to despise ones own soul.</HI>
And he who could not be <HI>thankful</HI> for being <HI>chid,</HI>
was judg'd by <HI>him</HI> to be <HI>unworthy</HI> of any honest
mans <HI>anger.</HI> Nor can I imagine a solid reason,
why he was careful in time of <HI>health,</HI> to bespeak
my presence in time of <HI>Sickness,</HI> (of which you
are able to be his <HI>witness,)</HI> unless because he did
esteem me the most <HI>affectionate</HI> person of his ac|quaintance,
by his having still found me the most
<PB N="445" REF="226">
<HI>severe.</HI> To conceal his <HI>great failing,</HI> (which was
<HI>so</HI> far <HI>scandalous,</HI> as it was <HI>publick,</HI> and apt to
be hurtful by the <HI>reverence</HI> which many men had
to his <HI>example,)</HI> and <HI>only</HI> to speak of the <HI>best</HI>
things in him, were rather to <HI>flatter,</HI> then to <HI>com|mend</HI>
him. But yet as the Scripture hath said of
<HI>David, that he did what was right in the eyes
of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 15. 5.</NOTE> save only in the matter of Uriah
the Hittite,</HI> so I think I may say of your <HI>self|departed,</HI>
that unless it were in that <HI>one</HI> unhap|piness,
of ingaging himself in an ugly Cause,
(which yet he seriously repented, and so was fitted
for that <HI>early,</HI> but most <HI>exemplary death,</HI> which
happily opened a <HI>door</HI> to his <HI>Immortality,)</HI> his
greatest <HI>Vice</HI> was but <HI>this,</HI> that he modestly <HI>con|cealed</HI>
too many <HI>Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>The remarkable <HI>manner</HI> of his <HI>departure</HI> did
most remarkably resemble <HI>Sir Spencer Compton's</HI>
(a person so singularly qualified, by <HI>Grace,</HI> and
<HI>Nature,</HI> and <HI>Education,</HI> that however his extra|ction
was <HI>highly Noble,</HI> I may confidently say it
was the lowest thing in him,) who dyed at <HI>Bruges</HI>
about the time, wherein <HI>the man of our desires</HI>
expir'd at <HI>Compton.</HI> Never did I hear of a more
heavenly <HI>Valediction</HI> to all the contentments of
the earth, than was given by <HI>these two</HI> at <HI>their</HI>
<PB N="446" REF="227">
dissolutions. Never yet did I hear, of any <HI>two
farewells</HI> so much <HI>alike.</HI> Never were any more
<HI>admired,</HI> by those that <HI>saw</HI> them whilst they were
<HI>going;</HI> or more <HI>desired,</HI> when they were <HI>gon.</HI>
How your excellent <HI>Husband</HI> behav'd himself, <HI>I</HI>
have but <HI>partly</HI> related in the conclusion of my
Sermon. For though <HI>I</HI> may not dissemble so great
a Truth, as my strong inclinations both to <HI>think</HI> and
<HI>speak</HI> of him to <HI>his advantage;</HI> yet in my <HI>last</HI>
office of friendship, <HI>I</HI> did religiously set so strict a
<HI>watch</HI> over my <HI>tongue,</HI> as that <HI>I</HI> rather came
<HI>short</HI> in <HI>many</HI> points of his commendation, than
went <HI>beyond</HI> him in any <HI>one.</HI> And could <HI>I</HI> have
had the possibility to have kept him company in his
sickness, which <HI>I</HI> as earnestly <HI>endeavour'd</HI> as He
<HI>desir'd</HI> it, (but his sickness was too short, and my
journey too long, for either of us either to <HI>give,</HI> or
to <HI>receive</HI> that satisfaction,) <HI>I</HI> might have <HI>perfe|cted</HI>
that account, which many <HI>witnesses</HI> enabl'd
me to give in <HI>part.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus far spoken of <HI>him</HI> to <HI>you,</HI> I must
only speak of <HI>you</HI> to <HI>others.</HI> For such as <HI>reject</HI>
what they <HI>deserve, I</HI> think it a Panegyrick <HI>suffi|cient,</HI>
to make it known they will have <HI>none.</HI> Ha|ving
dedicated my <HI>papers</HI> to a person of your In|dowments,
for whom to <HI>approve,</HI> is to <HI>patronize</HI>

your <HI>own,</HI> have already been Lords of that seat for
more than eighteen Generations, (which <HI>I</HI> can

<HEAD>THE

A SERMON Preached at the Funeral of
Mr. EDWARD PETTO.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOB XIV. 1.</BIBL>
<Q>Man that is born of a Woman, hath but a short time
to live, and is full of Trouble.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NOw ye have listen'd unto the <HI>Text,</HI> Cast
your Eyes upon the <HI>shrine</HI> too. For
that does verifie <HI>This,</HI> by no less then an
Ocular Demonstration. You see the Reliques
of a Person, full of honour indeed, but not of
years; he having had his <HI>December</HI> (I may say)
in <HI>Iune;</HI> and reaching the end of his Journy,
(as 'twere) in the middle of his Course. So
that if I should be silent upon the mention only
of this Text <HI>[Man that is born of a Woman hath
but a short time to live,]</HI> That very Hearse would
present us with a <HI>visible Sermon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="229">Yet something I must say, in Honour and
Duty unto the <HI>Dead;</HI> and something too, for
the use and benefit of the <HI>Living;</HI> that as Death
<HI>already</HI> hath been to <HI>Him,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> it <HI>may</HI> be also to
<HI>Us</HI> Advantage; That <HI>some</HI> at least who here are
present, may go from Hence (when I have
done,) if not the <HI>wiser</HI> or <HI>more intelligent,</HI> yet at
least the <HI>more considerate,</HI> and the <HI>better Resolved</HI>
for coming hither. I need not be teaching my
<HI>weakest</HI> Brethren, (what common <HI>Experience</HI>
hath taught us <HI>All,)</HI> either the <HI>Misery,</HI> or the
<HI>shortness,</HI> or the <HI>uncertainty</HI> of our Days. But
yet recounting how many Souls do perish for
ever in their Impieties, not so much by wan|ting
<HI>Knowledge,</HI> as by abounding in the <HI>Thought|lesness</HI>
of what they know, I shall not su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e be
unexcusable (having S. <HI>Peter</HI> for my example)
if I <HI>tell</HI> you those things which you <HI>know already.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Per. 1. 12. 13. 15.</NOTE>
An Honest <HI>Remembrancer</HI> is as needful, as the
most Eloquent <HI>Instructor</HI> to be imagin'd, because
we do less want the <HI>Knowledge,</HI> than the <HI>conside|ration</HI>
of our Duties. S. <HI>Peter</HI> hath magnified
the office no less than <HI>three times together</HI> in that
<HI>Epistle</HI> which he compos'd a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. ver. 14.</NOTE> little before his
<HI>Dissolution. I will not</HI> (saith he) <HI>be negligent to
put you alwayes in Remembrance, though ye know
<PB N="451" REF="229">
these things, and be established in the Truth. Yea I
think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to
stir you up, by putting you in Remembrance.</HI> Again
(saith he) <HI>I will endeavour that ye may be able,
after my Decease, to have these things always in
Remembrance.</HI> When I consider that these
words were by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 3. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Divine Inspiration,</HI> and that
they were written for <HI>our Instruction,</HI> yea and
<HI>inculcated</HI> upon us no less than <HI>thrice</HI> in <HI>one breath;</HI>
methinks they tacitely <HI>reprove</HI> us, for having
such wanton and <HI>Itching Ears,</HI> as will be satis|fied
with nothing but what is <HI>New.</HI> Whereas
the Thing that is to us of greatest moment, is
not the study of <HI>more</HI> Knowledge, but the ma|king
good <HI>use</HI> of the things we know. Not the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urnishing of our <HI>Heads</HI> with a Richer Treasure
of <HI>Speculations,</HI> but the laying them up within
our <HI>Hearts,</HI> and the drawing them out into our
<HI>Lives.</HI> Men would not live as they are wont,
were they sufficiently<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Isocrat. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> <HI>mindful</HI> that they are
<HI>men.</HI> Did they but often enough consider, how
<HI>short a time they have to live;</HI> how very<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11. 23.</NOTE> <HI>often
they are in Deaths,</HI> before they dye; how much
their short time of life is more<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Mat. 24. 42.</NOTE> <HI>uncertain</HI> than
it is short; how very shortly they are to render
a strict Account unto the <HI>Iudge,</HI> (I say not of
<PB N="452" REF="230">
every <HI>evil work,</HI> but) even of every<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Mat. 12. 36.</NOTE> <HI>idle word,</HI>
and of each unprofitable hour; they would not
make so many Demurrs in the important work
of their Reformation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 21. 36.</NOTE> The <HI>uncertainty</HI> of their
Time would make them <HI>watchful</HI> over their
ways; that how <HI>suddenly</HI> soever they may be
<HI>Caught,</HI> (by the common Pursevant of Nature)
it may not be by a <HI>surprize.</HI> That they may not
die with the <HI>Fools Motto,</HI> [Non<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Polyb. l. 10. p. 603.</NOTE> put&acirc;ram] in
their mouths.</P>
<P>Now to consider my present Text in the
most useful manner that I am able, I must be|speak
your best Attention, not so much to the
<HI>Dogmatical,</HI> as to the <HI>Applicatory</HI> part of my Me|ditations.
It being chiefly in my design, to shew
what <HI>Profit</HI> we are to <HI>reap</HI> from all such melan|choly
Solemnities, as by many deep <HI>Mourners</HI>
are <HI>sown</HI> in Tears. What kind of Influences
and Virtues, from the great <HI>brittleness</HI> of our
Lives, are to be shed upon the <HI>Practice</HI> and <HI>Con|duct</HI>
of them. What kind of <HI>Consectaries</HI> and
<HI>Uses</HI> should flow from the <HI>one,</HI> upon the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not therefore wear out my little Time
in any such accurate and logical <HI>Analysing</HI> of the
words, as would but serve to divert you from
the <HI>scope</HI> and <HI>drift,</HI> for which the holy man <HI>Iob</HI>
<PB N="453" REF="230">
did make them a part of <HI>his</HI> Preaching, and for
which I have chosen them to be the subject of
<HI>mine own;</HI> but shall immediately consider them
as an entire Doctrinal Proposition, exhibiting
to us both the <HI>frailty,</HI> and <HI>frame</HI> of man, and
the <HI>reason</HI> of the one implicitly rising out of the
other. <HI>Man is born of a Woman;</HI> there's his
<HI>Frame. Hath but a short time to live,</HI> there's his
<HI>Frailty.</HI> Hath but a short time to live, <HI>because</HI>
he is born of a Woman; there is the <HI>Reason</HI> of
his Frailty, from the <HI>condition</HI> of his Frame.
Nor is he attended only with <HI>vanity,</HI> but <HI>vexa|tion</HI>
of <HI>spirit.</HI> As <HI>Iacob</HI> said unto <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> His
Days are <HI>Evil,</HI> as well as <HI>Few.</HI> However <HI>empty</HI>
of better Things, yet from the <HI>Bottom</HI> to the
<HI>Top,</HI> (I mean from his Birth unto his Burial,)
he is <HI>Repletus miseriis, fill'd full of Trouble.</HI></P>
<P>And yet by way of <HI>Application,</HI> we may re|flect
upon the Text in a threefold <HI>Antithesis.</HI>
For</P>
<P>To Man as <HI>born of a Woman,</HI> we may op|pose
the same Man, as being <HI>Regenerate,</HI> and
<HI>born of God.</HI></P>
<P>To the very <HI>short life</HI> he hath by <HI>Nature,</HI> we
may oppose the <HI>life Eternal</HI> he hath by <HI>Grace.</HI></P>
<P>And to his <HI>fulness of misery</HI> whilst he is here
<PB N="454" REF="231">
in the body, we may oppose his <HI>fulness of Bliss
and Glory.</HI></P>
<P>But first let Man be consider'd in his <HI>Hypogaeo,</HI>
that is, his state of <HI>Declination,</HI> as he is <HI>born of
a Woman,</HI> and having a <HI>short time</HI> to live; and
that for this reason, <HI>because</HI> he is born of a Wo|man.
For 'tis a Maxime in Philosophy which
never fails, That Generable and Corruptible
are Terms Convertible. It is demonstrably
prov'd we must one day <HI>Dye,</HI> because we did
one day <HI>begin</HI> to <HI>Live.</HI> All that is born of a
Woman is both <HI>mixt,</HI> and <HI>compounded,</HI> after the
Image of the Woman of whom 'tis born; not
only <HI>mixt</HI> of the four Elements, but also <HI>com|pounded</HI>
of Matter and Form. And all things
Compounded<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Arist. Eth. lib. 10. cap. 3.</NOTE> must be dissolv'd, into the very
same Principles of which at first they were
compos'd. Hence are those pangs and yernings
of the flesh and the spirit, of the Appetite and
the Will, of the law in the members, and the law
in the mind;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Id. l. 9. c. 4.</NOTE> the one inclining towards <HI>Earth,</HI>
from whence 'twas <HI>taken,</HI> and the other towards
<HI>Heaven,</HI> from whence 'twas <HI>sent.</HI> The truth of
this had been apparent, if it had been only ta|ken
out of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <HI>Lyceum;</HI> but we have it
confirmed out of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>Portch</HI> too: for in
<PB N="455" REF="231">
the Day when man goeth to his<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Eccles. 12. 5. 3, 4, 5, 6, 5.</NOTE> <HI>long home,</HI>

made it good. Who after a</HI> first or second Course
<HI>(as I may say) of</HI> living, <HI>as if he had</HI> surfetted

<HI>for so saith the Scripture,</HI> 1. Kings 19. 4. <HI>He</HI>
went into the Wilderness <HI>(a solitary place) and

<HI>(in a very disconsolate and doleful manner,)

<HI>How did he</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Job 3. 1, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</NOTE> Curse the Day of his Birth, <HI>and</HI> the

what was his reason for this unkindness to that

<P>The Time would fail me should I but men|tion
the hundreth part of those men, whose
<HI>short time</HI> of life hath seemed <HI>long</HI> to them, even
because they have felt it so <HI>full of Trouble.</HI> But
enough hath been said concerning the <HI>Doctrin</HI> of
the Text. And it lies upon us now to make
some <HI>Use.</HI></P>
<P>First then let us consider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Applica|tion.</NOTE> that if man (as
born of a woman) hath but a <HI>short</HI> time to live,
It concerns us to take up the prayer of <HI>David,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 39. 4.</NOTE>
that God will <HI>teach us to know our End, and the
number of our Dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 20. 6.</NOTE> that we</HI> (like Hezekiah)
<HI>may be fully certified how short our Time is.</HI> It con|cerns
us to take up the resolution of <HI>Iob; All
the dayes of our appointed time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 14. 14.</NOTE> incessantly waiting

with the rich man in the Parable, <HI>we will pull
down our Barns and build greater,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 12. 18.</NOTE> and there we will
bestow all our fruits and our goods:</HI> much less may
we say, with that other Worldling, <HI>Souls take
your ease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers&punc; 19.</NOTE> eat, drink, and be merry, for ye have
much goods laid up for many years:</HI> for (alas!)
how can we know, (s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lly creatures as we are,)
but that <HI>this very Night,</HI> yea this very <HI>minute,</HI>
<PB N="470" REF="239">
either <HI>they</HI> may be taken from <HI>us,</HI> or <HI>we</HI> from
<HI>them?</HI> there is such a fadingness on <HI>their</HI> parts,
and such a fickleness on <HI>ours.</HI> But rather it con|cerns
us to say with <HI>Iob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 1. 21.</NOTE> Naked came we into the
world,</HI> and <HI>naked shall we go out of it.</HI> Or it con|cerns
us rather yet to say with David,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 39. 12.</NOTE> that <HI>we
are strangers upon Earth,</HI> and but so many <HI>sojour|ners,
as all our Fathers were:</HI> for wihlst we con|sider
we are but <HI>strangers,</HI> we shall, as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 2. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Stran|gers

behaving our selves <HI>among the Gentiles, as a cho|sen

a peculiar People, we shall shew forth his praise,
who hath called us out of Darkness, into his marvel|lous
Light.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly let us consider, that since our <HI>Life</HI>
is <HI>uncertain,</HI> as well as <HI>short,</HI> (inasmuch as we
know not <HI>how</HI> short it is) it concerns us <HI>imme|diately,</HI>
to labour hard in the <HI>Improvement</HI> of this
our <HI>span</HI> into <HI>Eternity;</HI> to <HI>employ</HI> our very <HI>short</HI>
and <HI>uncertain</HI> time, in making a <HI>seasonable</HI> pro|vision
against them <HI>both;</HI> I mean, its <HI>shortness,</HI>
and its <HI>uncertainty.</HI> For shall we be <HI>lavish</HI> even
<PB N="471" REF="239">
of <HI>that,</HI> which is so easily <HI>lost,</HI> and of which
we have so very <HI>little,</HI> and every <HI>minute</HI> of which

be either a kind of <HI>Pulley</HI> to help raise us up to

we ought to be <HI>charie</HI> of our <HI>Time,</HI> which

Antithesis,</HI> which we ought to oppose to the

priviledge, as he is <HI>born of a woman;</HI> but an eter|nity
of <HI>bliss,</HI> which is competent to him only,
as <HI>born of God.</HI> And of this bliss there is such a

it. Or if we were able to understand it,
yet our <HI>hearts</HI> are two <HI>narrow</HI> to give it entrance.
Or if our hearts could hold it, yet our <HI>tongues</HI>
are too <HI>stammering,</HI> to express and utter it. Or
if we were able to do that, yet our lives are too
<HI>short,</HI> to communicate and reveal it to other
creatures. In a word, it is such, as not only <HI>eye

have reached those ends. He was so eminently

eminently <HI>righteous,</HI> that (as I said) he was in
pain, till he had rendred to <HI>every man his due.</HI>
<PB N="487" REF="247">
Being so <HI>sober,</HI> and so <HI>righteous,</HI> he is inferred to

<P>To pass on therefore towards his <HI>death,</HI> as
the fittest transition unto his <HI>burial; I</HI> am en|abled
to say of him, (by such as were eye and
ear witnesses,) that he abundantly injoyed [that
<GAP DESC="foreign">] that happy <HI>calmness of death,</HI> which the
Emperour <HI>Augustus</HI> was wont to pray for. I
say he injoy'd it in <HI>both acceptions</HI> of the word&punc;
For first however he was sick of a <HI>burning Fea|ver,</HI>
(which carried him up, like <HI>Elias,</HI> in a
<HI>fiery Chariot,)</HI> yet he had this <HI>rare</HI> happiness
which is the priviledge but of few, that he even
<HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">joyed</HI> his whole <HI>disease,</HI> without the least taint
<PB N="488" REF="248">
of <HI>deliration.</HI> That knot of union betwixt his
body and his soul, was not violently <HI>broken,</HI> but
very leasurely <HI>untied;</HI> they having parted like
<HI>two friends,</HI> not by a rude <HI>falling out,</HI> but a <HI>lo|ving
farewell.</HI> Thus was his <HI>Euthanasia</HI> in the
<HI>first</HI> acception of the word. But he had it much
more, as to the <HI>second.</HI> For</P>
<P>Two things there are, which are wont to
make death terrible. The first is <HI>suddenness,</HI>
the second, <HI>sin.</HI> He was so arm'd against the
<HI>first,</HI> that he did not only take care for the <HI>setting
his outward house in order,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">King. 20. 1.</NOTE> that nothing in <HI>this</HI>
world might trash his flight towards a <HI>better;</HI>
but also sent for the <HI>Divine,</HI> to imp the <HI>wings</HI> of
his devotion; and farther told his <HI>Physician,</HI>
that <HI>God had sent him his summons;</HI> so well was
he arm'd against the <HI>first</HI> of those <HI>Phobera,</HI> and
that by the help of our English <HI>Litany,</HI> which
prompts us to pray <HI>against sudden death;</HI> and
which he commanded one of his servants to
<HI>assist</HI> him with upon his death-bed, bestowing
upon it (when he had don) a great deal of holy
<HI>admiration.</HI></P>
<P>Again, so well was he prepared against the
<HI>second,</HI> that for the <HI>tenderness</HI> of his conscience,
and his deep <HI>resentment</HI> of all his sins, <HI>those of
<PB N="489" REF="248">
the times</HI> more especially, in which he deplo|red

(till God was pleas'd in much mercy to shew
him that <HI>errour of his judgment,</HI> by which the
<HI>errour of his practice</HI> was bred and cherish'd;)
Next for his <HI>hatred of himself</HI> in remembrance
of them, (though we may say, that in <HI>compari|son</HI>
with many others alive and dead, he had
kept himself <HI>unspotted from the world;)</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 1. 27.</NOTE> Then
for his stedfast <HI>resolutions</HI> of better life, of ma|king

his time;) and last of all for his <HI>sollicitude,</HI> that
<HI>all his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Josh. 24. 15.</NOTE> family</HI> might live in the fear of God,
and <HI>redeem</HI> those opportunities, which he seem'd
(unto <HI>himself</HI>) to have sometimes <HI>lost,</HI> or <HI>neg|lected;</HI>
I say, in all these respects, he appears to
<HI>me,</HI> (as well as to <HI>others,</HI>) a more than ordinary

<P>But some may say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Object.</NOTE> that <HI>sick</HI> persons are ever

squeez'd out by <HI>sickness.</HI> And as soon as they
<HI>recover,</HI> they do <HI>relaps</HI> too.</P>
<P>To which I say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ.</NOTE> that though 'tis often so in
<HI>others,</HI> yet in this <HI>exemplary</HI> Christian it could <HI>not</HI>
be so. For</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="249">First it was a mark of his <HI>sincerity,</HI> that he
look'd upon his failings, as through a <HI>Micro|scope;</HI>
which made them seem <HI>nearer,</HI> and very
much <HI>greater</HI> than they were. He warn'd all
those who stood about his sick bed, to beware
of those sins which the world calls <HI>little;</HI> and
of the <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">-little</HI> sins which the world calls <HI>none;</HI>
yea from the very least<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 5. 22</NOTE> <HI>appearances</HI> and <HI>oppor|tunities</HI>
of sin. It was his own expression, that
<HI>all the sins of his former life did even kick in his very
face;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 5. 8.</NOTE> yet he remembred the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mat. 20. 9.</NOTE> <HI>labourer,</HI> who

<P>Secondly, It was another good token of his
<HI>sincerity,</HI> that he was not meerly a <HI>death-bed pe|nitent,</HI>
whose repentance too too often is but

<P><PB N="491" REF="249">Thirdly, 'Twas another mark of his <HI>since|rity,</HI>
that he <HI>insisted</HI> on the nature of <HI>true repen|tance,</HI>

those desperate notions of Repentance,
which the world is so commonly mistaken in.</P>
<P>Fourthly, 'Twas a comfortable token of his
<HI>sincerity,</HI> that he was <HI>obstinate in his Prayers,</HI>
against the <HI>precept</HI> of his <HI>Physician;</HI> and resolv'd
to pour out his soul, though to the prejudice of
his body. As if he were piously ambitious of
being too strong for his own infirmities; when
a reverend Divine (who was standing by) would
fain have don that office for him, at least as a
Deputy to his <HI>lungs</HI> only, that he might not
spend his <HI>few spirits</HI> as yet left in him; he made
him this resolute, and hasty, but pious answer,
that <HI>whilst a Tongue was in his head whereby to
speak, and whilst he had breath in his body to move
and animate his Tongue, and whilst he had lungs in
<PB N="492" REF="250">
his brest to supply his breath, he would shew forth
the goodness and the glory of God, who had been
pleas'd to do so great thing for him.</HI> And in a
merci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">l Answer to all his Prayers, which he
continued to the <HI>amazement</HI> of all that heard
him, (after some <HI>conflicts</HI> which he had had
with the <HI>ghostly enemy,</HI> to make him happier in
a vict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ious, than he could possibly have been in
an untry'd innocence,) God was pleased (<HI>very
signally</HI>) to reveal himself to him, <HI>to speak peace
unto his Conscience,</HI> to fill him inwardly <HI>with joy
in the Holy Ghost,</HI> to give him some <HI>glimmerings</HI>
and <HI>fore-tasts</HI> of <HI>the glory to be revealed.</HI> That
I may use his own words, (which, as he came
out of a <HI>Trance,</HI> he was heard to speak,) <HI>he had
a ravishing glimps of the Beatifick Vision;</HI> mean|ing
thereby (as I interpret) that God had re|freshed
his drooping spirits with his unspeak|able
comforts; saying unto his soul, <HI>I am thy
salvation,</HI> or <HI>this day salvation is come to thy house.</HI>
So that now being plac'd above the level of
temptations, and exempted from the fear of
what the * <HI>red Dragon</HI> could do unto him, he
cheerfully <HI>lifted up his head,</HI> and fixt his eyes up|on
Jesus, <HI>the author and finisher of his faith,</HI> and
<HI>for the joy that was set before him,</HI> expected the
<PB N="493" REF="250">
Advent of his <HI>death,</HI> as of a very <HI>dear friend.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, It was another great sign that <HI>his
heart was right towards God,</HI> and therefore not
treacherous to <HI>himself,</HI> that he extended his
care to the souls of <HI>others,</HI> with as true a cha|rity,
as to his <HI>own;</HI> exhorting <HI>one</HI> in particular
against the <HI>love of this world;</HI> charging <HI>another</HI>
to be watchful against <HI>intemperance,</HI> and <HI>debauch;</HI>
exciting a <HI>third</HI> unto <HI>frequent and fervent prayer.</HI>
I do but mention the several subjects, on which
he <HI>treated</HI> like a <HI>Divine.</HI> To all his servants in
the general, and to three of them in special,
(for his words like<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Exod. 16. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Manna</HI> in the wilderness,
and the <HI>Apostles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Act. 2. 45.</NOTE> doal,</HI> were discreetly <HI>proportio|ned</HI>
to every one <HI>as he had need;</HI> so as they who
had most of his Deathbed instructions had <HI>no|thing
over,</HI> and they who had <HI>least</HI> had <HI>no lack,)
I</HI> say, in general, and in special, he was by his
precepts, as well as practice, (even as righte|ous
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 2. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Noah</HI>) a true <HI>Preacher of Repentance.</HI> Nor
did his care end here. But</P>
<P>As it were in imitation of good old <HI>Iacob,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 49.</NOTE>
before he was <HI>gather'd to his fathers,</HI> he gave a
