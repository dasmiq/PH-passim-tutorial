<OPENER><SALUTE>My Noble Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe People, who (as one sayes well) are Iudges without Iudgement, and Authors without Authority, had condemn'd this Play on the Stage, for want of being right|ly represented unto them; at which, many noble Persons were so much of|fended, as I could not in any one Act do it more right, or give them more satisfaction, then by Printing it, to shew its Innocence. As it is, it has had the honour to have been approv'd by most of the better and wiser Sort;
<PB REF="3">
and if your Excellence but adde unto it your Approbation, I desire no more. It wants much of the Ornament of the Stage, but th&acirc;t by a lively imaginati|on may easily be supplyed: For my part, unless it may be presented as I writ it, and as I intended it, I had rather it shu'd be read then acted, and have the World for Theatre, rather then the Stage.</P>
<P>Having said thus much by way of Prologue, I leave you to the Play, re|maining alwayes,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Excellencies Most humble, and most devoted Servant,

<HEAD>To the noble Readers.</HEAD>
<P>TO think to write without faults, is to think to peel a <HI>Bulbus</HI> Root to the last Rinde, or sweep an earthen Floor to the last grain of dust; and 'tis h&ecirc;re, as in the Mint, where if the Dross exceed not the pure <HI>Or,</HI> it passes for currant Coin. The greatest fault in this kinde of writing, is to erre ag&acirc;inst Art and <HI>Decorum,</HI> of which I hope this Play is free; who findes fault with the mirth in it, never consider how here with us, mirth in Playes of this kinde is like Alloy in Coin, which though it abases it, yet makes it more passible. For the Rhyme, 'tis more excusable in Pastorals, then in other Playes; and where I leave the Rhyme or numbers, I imagin'd, that as a good Actor was like a good Singer, so a good Play was like a good Song; where 'tis not necessary all notes shu'd be of an equal length. For the Plot 'tis neat and handsome, and the Language soft and gentle, suitable to the persons who speak, nei|ther on the Ground, nor in the Clouds; but just like the Stage, somewhat elevated above the common. In neither, no stifness, and (I hope) no impertinence nor extravagance; into which,
<PB REF="4">
your young writers are apt to run; who whilst they know not well what to do, and are anxious to do enough, most commonly overdo. Those who think it so easie now to make a good Play, will tell me some twenty years hence how hard it is; when they will finde that 'tis not a good Hu|mor or two in a Comedy will do it, (which are good supports 'tis true; but to think they will make a Play, is to think a Pillar or two sufficient to make a House) nor the writing a fine Copy of Verses or two, sufficient to make a Tragedy, or Trage-Comedy; but there must go a <HI>Genius</HI> as well as <HI>Ingenium</HI> to't, with long exercise and ex|perience. But to leave their Playes, and return to ours; if you like it for whom I writ it, I have my end, which was onely in an innocent and harm|less way, to divert my self and you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Noble Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send your Excellency here a short Discourse of the <HI>English Stage,</HI> (which if you pleas'd you could far better treat of then my self) but before I begin it, I will speak a word or two of th&ocirc;se of other Countreys.</P>
<P>About the midst of the last Century, Playes, after a long discontinuance, and civil death in a manner, began to be reviv'd again, first in <HI>Italy</HI> by <HI>Guarino, Tasso, de Porta,</HI> and others; and after|wards in <HI>Spain</HI> by <HI>Lopes de Vega;</HI> the French be|ginning later by reason of their Civil Wars, Car|dinal
<PB REF="49" MS="y">
<HI>Richlieu</HI> being the first that brought them into that Vouge and Esteem as now they are; well knowing how much the Acting noble and heroick Playes, conferr'd to the instilling a no|ble and heroick Spirit into the Nation. For &ucirc;s, we began before them, and if since they seem to have out-stript us, 'tis because our Stage ha's stood at a stand this many years; nor may we doubt, but now we shall soon out-strip them again, if we hold on but as we begin. Of the Dutch I speak nothing, because they are but slow, and follow other Nations onely afar off: But to return unto our present subject.</P>
<P><HI>Playes</HI> (which so flourisht amongst the Greeks, and afterwards amongst the Romans) were al|most wholly abolished when their Empire was first converted to Christianity, and their Thea|ters, together with their Temples, for the most part, demolished as Reliques of Paganisme, some few onely reserved and dedicate to the service of the True God, as they had been to their false gods before; from which time to the last Age, they Acted nothing here, but Playes of the holy Scripture, or Saints Lives; and that without any certain Theaters or set Companies, till about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign, they began here to assemble into Companies, and set up Theaters, first in the City, (as in the Inn|yards of the <HI>Cross-Keyes,</HI> and <HI>Bull</HI> in <HI>Grace</HI>
<PB REF="49">
and <HI>Bishops-Gate Street</HI> at this day is to be seen) till that Fanatick Spirit which then began with the Stage, and after ended with the Throne, banisht them thence into the Suburbs, as after they did the Kingdom, in the beginning of our Civil Wars. In which time, Playes were so lit|tle incompatible with Religion, and the Thea|ter with the Church, as on Week-dayes after Vespers, both the Children of the Chappel and St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> Acted Playes, the one in <HI>White-Friers,</HI> the other behinde the Convocation-house in <HI>Pauls,</HI> till people growing more precise, and Playes more licentious, the Theatre of <HI>Pauls</HI> was quite supprest, and that of the Children of the Chappel, converted to the use of the Children of the Revels.</P>
<P>In this time were Poets and Actors in their greatest flourish, <HI>Iohnson, Shakespear,</HI> with <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> their Poets, and <HI>Field</HI> and <HI>Burbidge</HI> their Actors.</P>
<P>For Playes, <HI>Shakespear</HI> was one of the first, who inverted the Dramatick Stile, from dull Hi|story to quick Comedy, upon whom <HI>Iohnson</HI> re|fin'd; as <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> first writ in the Heroick way, upon whom <HI>Suckling</HI> and others endeavoured to refine agen&punc; one saying wittily of his <HI>Aglaura,</HI> that 'twas full of fine flowers, but they seem'd rather stuck, then growing there; as another of <HI>Shakespear's</HI> writings, that 'twas
<PB REF="50">
a fine Garden, but it wanted weeding.</P>
<P>There are few of our English Playes (except|ing onely some few of <HI>Iohnsons</HI>) without some faults or other; and if the French have fewer then our English, 'tis because they confine them|selves to narrower limits, and consequently have less liberty to erre.</P>
<P>The chief faults of ours, are our huddling too much matter together, and making them too long and intricate; we imagining we never have intrigue enough, till we lose our selves and Auditors, who shu'd be led in a Maze, but not a Mist; and through turning and winding wayes, but s&ocirc; still, as they may finde their way at last.</P>
<P>A good Play shu'd be like a good stuff, closely and evenly wrought, without any breakes, thrums, or loose ends in 'um, or like a good Pi|cture well painted and designed; the Plot or Con|trivement, the Design, the Writing, the Coloris, and Counterplot, the Shaddowings, with other Embellishments: or finally, it shu'd be like a well contriv'd Garden, cast into its Walks and Coun|terwalks, betwixt an Alley and a Wilderness, nei|ther too plain, nor too confus'd. Of all Arts, that of the Dramatick Poet is the most difficult and most subject to censure; for in all others, they write onely of some particular subject, as the Ma|thematician of Mathematicks, or Philosopher of
<PB REF="50">
Philosophy; but in that, the Poet must write of every thing, and every one undertakes to judge of it.</P>
<P>A Dramatick Poet is to the Stage as a Pilot to the Ship; and to the Actors, as an Architect to the Builders, or Master to his Schollars: he is to be a good moral Philosopher, but yet more learned in Men then Books. He is to be a wise, as well as a witty Man, and a good man, as well as a good Po|et; and I'de allow him to be so far a good fellow too, to take a chearful cup to whet his wits, so he take not so much to dull 'um, and whet 'um quite away.</P>
<P>To compare our English Dramatick Poets to|gether (without taxing them) <HI>Shakespear</HI> excelled in a natural Vein, <HI>Fletcher</HI> in Wit, and <HI>Iohnson</HI> in Gravity and ponderousness of Style; whose one|ly fault was, he was too elaborate; and had he mixt less erudition with his Playes, they had been more pleasant and delightful then they are. Com|paring him with <HI>Shakespear,</HI> you shall see the diffe|rence betwixt Nature and Art; and with <HI>Fletcher,</HI> the difference betwixt Wit and Judgement: Wit being an exuberant thing, like <HI>Nilus,</HI> never more commendable then when it overflowes; but Judgement a stayed and reposed thing, alwayes containing it self within its bounds and limits.</P>
<P><HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> were excellent in their kinde, but they often err'd against <HI>Decorum,</HI> sel|dom

representing a valiant man without some|what of the <HI>Braggadoccio,</HI> nor an honourable wo|man without somewhat of <HI>Dol Common</HI> in her: to say nothing of their irreverent representing Kings persons on the Stage, who shu'd never be represented, but with Rev&ecirc;rence: Besides, <HI>Fletcher</HI> was the first who introduc't that witty obscenity in his Playes, which like poison infused in plea|sant liquor, is alwayes the more dangerous the more delightful. And here to speak a word or two of Wit, it is the spirit and quintessence of speech, extracted out of the substance of the thing we speak of, having nothing of the superfice, or dross of words (as clenches, quibbles, gingles, and such like trifles have) it is that, in pleasant and facetious discourse, as Eloquence is in grave and serious; not learnt by Art and Precept, but Nature and Company. 'Tis in vain to say any more of it; for if I could tell you what it were, it would not be what it is; being somewhat above expression, and such a volatil thing, as 'tis alto|gether as volatil to describe.</P>
<P>It was the happiness of the Actors of those Times to have such Poets as these to instruct them, and write for them; and no less of those Poets to have such docile and excellent Actors to Act their Playes, as a <HI>Field</HI> and <HI>Burbidge;</HI> of whom we may say, that he was a delightful <HI>Pro|teus,</HI> so wholly transforming himself into his Part,
<PB REF="51">
and putting off himself with his Cloathes, as he never (not so much as in the Tyring-house) as|sum'd himself again until the Play was done: there being as much difference betwixt him and one of our common Actors, as between a Ballad|singer who onely mouths it, and an excellent sin|ger, who knows all his Graces, and can artfully vary and modulate his Voice, even to know how much breath he is to give to every syllable. He had all the parts of an excellent Orator, (anima|ting his words with speaking, and Speech with Action) his Auditors being never more delight|ed then when he spake, nor more sorry then when he held his peace; yet even th&ecirc;n, he was an excellent Actor still, never falling in his Part when he had done speaking; but with his looks and gesture, maintaining it still unto the heighth, he imagining <HI>Age quod agis,</HI> onely spoke to him: so as those who call him a Player do him wrong, no man being less idle then he, whose whole life is no|thing else but action; with only this difference from other mens, that as what is but a Play to them, is his Business; so their business is but a play to him.</P>
<P>Now, for the difference betwixt our Thea|ters and those of former times, they were but plain and simple, with no other Scenes, nor Decorations of the Stage, but onely old Tape|stry, and the Stage strew'd with Rushes, (with their Habits accordingly) whereas ours now for
<PB REF="52">
cost and ornament are arriv'd to the heighth of Magnificence; but that which makes our Stage the better, makes our Playes the worse perhaps, they striving now to make them more for sight, then hearing; whence that solid joy of the interior is lost, and that benefit which men formerly receiv'd from Playes, from which they seldom or never went away, but far better and wiser then they came.</P>
<P>The Stage being a harmless and innocent Re|creation; where the minde is recreated and de|lighted, and that <HI>Ludus Literarum,</HI> or School of good Language and Behaviour, that makes Youth soonest Man, and man soonest good and vertuous, by joyning example to precept, and the pleasure of seeing to that of hearing. Its chiefest end is, to render Folly ridiculous, Vice odious, and Vertue and Noblenesse so amiable and lovely, as, every one shu'd be delighted and enamoured with it; from which when it de|flects; as, <HI>corruptio optimi pessima:</HI> of the best it becomes the worst of Recreations. And this his Majesty well understood, when after his happy Restauration, he took such care to purge it from all vice and obscenity; and would to God he had found all bodies and humours as apt and easie to be purg'd and reform'd as th&acirc;t.</P>
<P>For Scenes and Machines they are no new in|vention, our Masks and some of our Playes in
<PB REF="52">
former times (though not so ordinary) having had as good or rather better then any we have now.</P>
<P>They are excellent helps of imagination, most grateful deceptions of the sight, and grace|ful and becoming Ornaments of the Stage, transporting you easily without lassitude from one place to another; or rather by a kinde of de|lightful Magick, whilst you sit still, does bring the place to you. Of this curious Art the <HI>Itali|ans</HI> (this latter age) are the greatest masters, the <HI>French</HI> good proficients, and we in <HI>England</HI> one|ly Schollars and Learners yet, having proceeded no further then to bare painting, and not arriv'd to the stupendious wonders of your great Ingeni|ers, especially not knowing yet how to place our Lights, for the more advantage and illuminating of the Scenes.</P>
<P>And thus much suffices it briefly to have said of all that concerns our Modern Stage, onely to give others occasion to say more.</P>
