<HEAD>&cross; TO THE Christian Reader.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in Obedience to the desire of an <HI>Honourable Friend</HI> that this fol|lowing <HI>Discourse</HI> was written; that it was confined to such narrow lounds; and that it is now Published. He thought it requisite that such <HI>Catho|lics</HI> as are not at leasure to read <HI>Volums</HI> of <HI>Controversies,</HI> should be instruct|ed how to give a rational Account to Modern <HI>Sectaries, why they are Ca|tholics?</HI> and he thought also that to justifie such their Profession, a long <HI>Dis|course</HI> would not be necessary. This occasioned the following <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Question</HI> proposed in the <HI>Title:</HI> which <HI>Answer,</HI> if rational and satisfacto|ry, will prevent or rather determine, all other particular <HI>Questions</HI> about <HI>Religion,</HI> the debating of which furnishes the world with <HI>Books</HI> to fill great <HI>Libraries.</HI> But what fate soever shall befal this <HI>Answer</HI> in the esteem of <HI>Rea|ders,</HI> certain it is that the method of it is unquestionably useful, by which is shewed that the <HI>Controversie</HI> about the <HI>Church</HI> is first of all to be seriously debated: because what <HI>Party</HI> soever shall be able to give convincing <HI>Proofs</HI> that their <HI>Church</HI> is the same, or a true <HI>Member</HI> of the same <HI>Church</HI> which we believe in the <HI>Creed,</HI> shall thereby evince that all accusations laid against her are false and groundless, and all separation from her damnable. And on the other side it will be to no purpose to examine the Tenets of a Church al|ready prejudged to be a false <HI>Church,</HI> that is, to want the inseparable <HI>Marks</HI> of a <HI>true Church,</HI> signifyed by these words in our <HI>Creeds, One, Holy, Ca|tholic and Apostolic Church,</HI> denoting <HI>Unity of Faith, Sanctity of Disci|pline, Universality and uninterrupted Succession of Teachers and Gover|nors from the Apostles,</HI> to be necessary <HI>Signs</HI> of a <HI>true Church.</HI></P>
<P>Now for as much as regards the following <HI>Discourse,</HI> if any one shall think fit to undertake a <HI>Reply</HI> to it; he may please to take notice, that (unless he intend to make quarrels useless and endless) the only <HI>proper Reply</HI> will be his <HI>Answer</HI> to another like Question, which he may suppose to be proposed to him by a <HI>Catholic,</HI> viz. <HI>How can a Protestant think himself safe in a Congre|gation which never was incorporated in any Church whatsoever existent before the</HI> (pretended) <HI>Reformation?</HI> This <HI>Question,</HI> if seriously and ra|tionally resolved, and especially if the <HI>Resolution</HI> of it be justifyed by <HI>Au|thorities of</HI> (by us all approved) <HI>Antient Catholic Doctors,</HI> it will then on|ly be esteemed of considerable force against this following <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Que|stion, Why are you a Catholic?</HI></P>
<P>Now in this renewed Impression, the Author thought expedient that such a <HI>Second Question</HI> should be proposed, as by a <HI>Catholic</HI> to a <HI>Protestant,</HI> de|manding reciprocally of him, <HI>Why are you a Protestant?</HI> To which Que|stion an Answer is framed, the most suitable to <HI>Protestants</HI> grounds, that the Author could devise.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">He is not ignorant that this fashion of writing <HI>Controversies Dialogue|wise</HI> is oft obnoxious to exceptions, and not unjust suspicions of partiality and prevarication: For indeed we sometimes see <HI>Dialogues,</HI> in which the <HI>Au|thors</HI> (who may make their pretended <HI>Adversaries,</HI> to speak as they themselves please) do put foolish <HI>Answers</HI> into their mouths, and then laugh at them: presuming thereby to have gained a Victory.</P>
<P>But such a poor shift as this the <HI>Author</HI> protests against. The allegations a|gainst the <HI>Roman Church</HI> brought in by the <HI>Protestant,</HI> are, in the <HI>Authors</HI> opinion, the most considerable that are to be found among <HI>Protestant Con|trovertists,</HI> which allegations <HI>he</HI> is permitted also to deliver in a Stile, for its sharpness, becoming a Protestant now <HI>a la Mode.</HI> True it is, the <HI>Author</HI> could not possibly make him answer pertinently and directly to the <HI>Question.</HI> But whose fault is that? No such Answer, with tolerable satisfaction, as far as the <HI>Author</HI> could inform himself, could be found <HI>in rerum natura.</HI></P>
<P>Now if any <HI>Protestant Reader</HI> shall dislike the <HI>Author's</HI> introducing his <HI>Protestant</HI> sometimes relenting, or convinced that some <HI>Catholic Doctrines</HI> are too oft falsly and maliciously represented by <HI>Adversaries,</HI> the <HI>Authours</HI> excuse must be, that he having according to his conscience demonstrated so much, his duty was to shew his <HI>Adversary</HI> a rational, honest man, that is, such a one as will be satisfyed with reason: and indeed with no other is he willing to treat.</P>
<P>However, if this do not content the <HI>Reader,</HI> he may do well to frame a better <HI>Protestant Answer</HI> to the general <HI>Question [Why are you a Pro|testant?]</HI> But except such his <HI>Answer</HI> be indeed precisely pertinent, and proper to the clearing his <HI>Church</HI> from the Charge of <HI>Schism,</HI> either by shew|ing that she is indeed a true Member, incorporated into the <HI>Body</HI> of the Ca|tholic Church, believed in our Common Creed; Or that she is innocent, and not chargeable with <HI>Schism,</HI> though she be not, yea abhors to be, so incorpora|ted; he would do much better to save his labour. No other Answer can be per|tinent: No excursions into Invectives against any other <HI>Church,</HI> or <HI>Churches,</HI> will be at all to the purpose. Except therefore the pretended <HI>Answer</HI> be qualify|ed as hath been said, he must give the present <HI>Author</HI> leave to protest against it, as <HI>no Answer</HI> at all; notwithstanding which Protestation the Protestant may, and probably will, take leave to think and proclaim it unanswerable.</P>
<P>Now the rather to invite <HI>him</HI> to undertake such a just, though unusual, and hitherto unpractised a <HI>Task,</HI> the Author does here freely acknowledg, that was a principal end of his Writing and Publishing this <HI>Discourse:</HI> for the truth is, the World has been too long, and too much, abused with imperti|nencies and malicious <HI>Buffo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ries,</HI> to the perverting of Souls, encrease of <HI>A|theism,</HI> and shame of our <HI>Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Another considerable <HI>Motive</HI> also of composing this short <HI>Discourse,</HI> was a desire in the <HI>Author</HI> to take occasion to deliver briefly the <HI>Catholic Church's Doctrines,</HI> as they are in themselves, and freed from the curious fancies of <HI>School-men,</HI> and misprision of <HI>Sectaries,</HI> to the <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and the good of Souls</P>

<P>WHY are you a Catholic?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Catholic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I am a Christian, and by the Rule of Christian Faith (the Apostles Creed) am obliged to <HI>believe the holy Catholic Church.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you believe that Article before you was a Catholic?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought indeed at that time that I had believed it; but I have found since that I only thought so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then, you do not think that I believe this <HI>Article,</HI> as well as you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure that by vertue of this <HI>Article</HI> you are not obliged to be a <HI>Protestant.</HI></P>
</SP>
</DIV2>

<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps we do not agree in the sence of this <HI>Article.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may well be so: therefore for a tryal give me leave to propose a few <HI>Questions</HI> to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ask what you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>First then, when you say you <HI>believe the holy Catholic Church,</HI> do you not believe this <HI>Church to be one Body,</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> expresly
<PB N="2" REF="4">
teaches, saying, <HI>There is one Body, one Spirit, as there is one Hope of our calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all,</HI> &amp;c. Ephes. 4. 4. 5. 6. and as we profess in the following <HI>Creeds</HI> of the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I believe the true <HI>Catholic Church</HI> of Christ to be one Body.</P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. 3.</HEAD>
<SP>
<P>And do you not further believe, that this Church of Christ shall continue <HI>one Body</HI> till the end of the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes doubtless; for otherwise the time might come, in which this <HI>Article</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI> should be false: and also <HI>Christ's promise</HI> [That <HI>the Gates of Hell should never prevail against his Church</HI>] should fail.</P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. 4.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>In professing such a Belief of this <HI>Article,</HI> do you not also intend thereby to acknowledg your self <HI>a Member</HI> of this <HI>one Ca|tholic Church?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot surely think it a matter indifferent whether you be a Member of this <HI>one Church,</HI> or not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by no means: On the contrary I acknowledg, that whosoever is separated from this <HI>one Church</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and dies in that separation, cannot be saved.</P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. 5.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus far then we both agree. Let us further, if you please, consider, what a <HI>Church</HI> in general is, I mean <HI>a Christian Church?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I conceive it to be a <HI>Society</HI> of Men and Women publicly professing that <HI>Religion</HI> which they believe to have been taught by <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. 6.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>But every <HI>Society</HI> thus professing, is it thereby the same <HI>Church</HI> which we are taught to believe in the <HI>Creed?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is at least a part of that <HI>Church.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are then Societies of <HI>Heretics</HI> and <HI>Schismatics</HI> part of that <HI>one Church,</HI> since they also profess the <HI>Religion</HI> which they believe to have been taught by <HI>Christ?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: For they cut themselves off from this <HI>one Church,</HI> either by inventing New and false Doctrines, which renders them <HI>Heretics,</HI> that is, <HI>Chusers of a new Faith:</HI> Or by disobeying the Lawful Commands of this <HI>one Church,</HI> which renders them <HI>Schismatics,</HI> that is, <HI>Rebels.</HI></P>

<P>Can any Society be called <HI>one Body,</HI> or <HI>Corporation,</HI> unless it be <HI>united</HI> by common received <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Governors?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I now begin to perceive whither you would lead me, There|fore
<PB N="3" REF="4">
I must advise well lest I engage my self too far by an hasty an|swer to this Question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir it is not Victory, but truth we now regard. Therefore speak not of being <HI>engaged,</HI> but freely recal any Answer you have, or shall give, if you find cause. And as for the present Question, con|sider well what that is which makes a Society, as a Kingdom, a Pro|vince, an Army, a City, a Corporation to become one Body. Is it not an Obligation imposed on those who live respectively in any of these, to be subject to the peculiar Government and Laws there e|stablished? This appears plainly, in that wheresoever any one obsti|nately refuses such submission, he is esteemed and treated as a Rebel, a Fugitive, an outlawed person, and utterly deprived of all Pri|viledges and emoluments belonging to the said Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>This cannot be denyed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apply this then to <HI>God's Church. St. Paul</HI> says expresly, it is <HI>one Body:</HI> your <HI>Creed</HI> obliges you to call it <HI>One:</HI> The Scripture com|pares it to a <HI>City at Unity in it self:</HI> and to a <HI>well ordered Army with Banners,</HI> under which all Soldiers are reduced in their ranks, ex|pecting the Generals command, signifyed by subordinate officers. Such a society is Gods Church: It is the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> which if once divided cannot stand. But by his promise it (and no other Kingdom besides it) shall stand for ever; and therefore it shall never be <HI>Divi|ded,</HI> but all its members shall continue in their order. Now what makes such Order; but obedience to Government and Laws? Can you Imagine any other, excluding this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, I cannot, For it is plain, that where every one will be a Law to himself, there can be no <HI>Order</HI> nor <HI>Unity,</HI> no|thing but confusion and endless Divisions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hence it follows then, that the <HI>Church</HI> must necessarily con|sist of <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Disciples,</HI> of <HI>Governors</HI> and <HI>Subjects.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is granted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>And consequently, that it is a <HI>Visible Society.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>True: for otherwise none will be able to know whom, or what, to obey: No Society can be invisible to the members of it: and it is not a Society, if the Governors or Teachers in it be invisible, and the Laws unknown.</P>
</SP>

<P>By whom have these <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Governors</HI> been ap|pointed in the Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="5" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> informs us, Epes. 4. 11. 12. 13. saying, <HI>Christ gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini|stery, for the edifying of the Body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the Faith and of the knowledg of the Son of God unto a perfect man,</HI> &amp;c. So also we read in the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews, No man taketh this honour to himself, but he that is called of God, as was</HI> Aaron. Heb. 5. 4.</P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>This being so, are not they who are <HI>Disciples</HI> in Gods Church, obliged in conscience to believe their <HI>Teachers,</HI> and <HI>Sub|jects</HI> to obey their <HI>Governors?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, without doubt: But yet with this condition, that these <HI>Teachers</HI> teach <HI>truth,</HI> and these <HI>Governors</HI> command lawful things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is every <HI>Subject</HI> to be a <HI>Iudg</HI> whether the Doctrine taught him be true, and the thing commanded lawful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Scripture</HI> is to be Judg between them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed that which you say would be to some purpose, if the <HI>Scripture</HI> could speak and answer the Readers Questions and Doubts, as we two can do to one another. But the <HI>Scripture</HI> being only a <HI>Writing,</HI> and by consequence incapable of interpreting its own mean|ing whensoever any doubt of its true sence arises, if it may be per|mitted to every Christian to judg of his Teachers Doctrines by ex|amining them by <HI>Scripture,</HI> the Church may as well be without Teachers.</P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. 10.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know no remedy: For since it is evident to us, that there is on Earth no visible infallible <HI>Guide</HI> and <HI>Interpreter</HI> of <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI> we cannot rely upon any Man, or any Society of Men, so as to remain secure that they will not mislead us, either out of ignorance or secular interests. Therefore we must leave to all Christians <HI>a judg|ment of diseretion,</HI> to discern by the <HI>Light of Gods word,</HI> whether their <HI>Teachers</HI> guide them in the way of Truth, or not. Every one must take the best course he can, not to fall into any dangerous Error. And since <HI>Eternity</HI> depends upon it, it is not likely that men will wilfully misinterpret <HI>Scripture,</HI> to their own destruction; especially in <HI>Points Fundamental,</HI> which are so clearly set down in <HI>Scripture,</HI> that no <HI>sober Enquirer</HI> can be mistaken in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I have at present done asking <HI>Questions,</HI> and now (better enabled by what you have said) will endeavor to give you a fuller <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Question</HI> you proposed in the begining, <HI>viz.</HI><Q>Why are you a Catholick?</Q></P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y">
<HEAD>&sect;. 11.</HEAD>
<SP>
<P>First then, Sir, I am a <HI>Catholick</HI> because I believe that <HI>Christ the Author and Finisher of our Faith</HI> is infinitely both <HI>good, wise</HI> and <HI>om|nipotent.</HI> His <HI>goodness</HI> inclined him to come down into this world to save mankind, by establishing a Church upon earth, which should re|main till the end of the world, and in which the way to Heaven should be so taught, as not only the Wise and Learned, but the Poor, Simple and Ignorant also should by Faith and Obedience be made partakers of Eternal Happiness. Now his <HI>goodness</HI> having designed this; his <HI>wisdom</HI> enabled him to appoint <HI>ways</HI> and <HI>means</HI> proper to effect that his blessed Design; and <HI>omnipotence,</HI> to make those <HI>means</HI> success|ful.</P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; 12.</HEAD>
<SP>
<P>The <HI>general</HI> efficacious <HI>means</HI> to accomplish this, are first, <HI>The revealing his whole will to his Church;</HI> which we acknowledg to be suf|ficiently done in <HI>Holy Scripture,</HI> as to all <HI>points</HI> absolutely <HI>necessary</HI> to Salvation, though in all those <HI>points</HI> not so clearly to every one, that without a <HI>Teacher</HI> their sense may not be mistaken: Neither doth <HI>Scripture</HI> make an express discernment of what <HI>points</HI> are necessary. And secondly, The assisting of this his Church with fidelity and a con|stant performance of her duty in declaring all necessary Divine Truth manifested to her, to her Subjects; with a command, that all Christi|ans should obey and submit to what she shall teach or enjoyn them.</P>
<P>God having thus revealed his whole Will to his <HI>one Catholic Church,</HI> it necessarily and evidently follows. 1. That <HI>Ignorance,</HI> or <HI>Error,</HI> in any Points of Christian Doctrine necessary to Salvation, is damnable. 2. That <HI>a Seperation</HI> from this <HI>one Church</HI> is damnable also, upon what pretence soever the separation be made.</P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. 13.</HEAD>
<SP>
<P>Now to avoid eternal Misery thus threatned by <HI>Error</HI> or <HI>Schism,</HI> only one of these two ways is possible. 1. By ones own light to penetrate into all Mysteries, so as to be most firmly assured of a right understanding of all necessary verities revealed by God in <HI>Holy Scrip|tures.</HI> 2. Or out of a distrust of our own abilities to <HI>submit</HI> our Reason and <HI>internal Assent</HI> to <HI>Authority.</HI> The <HI>former</HI> of these ways, all <HI>Sects</HI> divided from the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> and among themselves, do uniform|ly take, being forced hereto by denying any visible Society of men to have any authority obliging the Consciences of their Subjects: and by conseqence they have all, if any, an equal Title (that is indeed e|qually none at all) to challenge belief, one as well as another: neither can they rationally, without deserting their common Ground, con|demn,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
or excommunicate one another. <HI>The latter</HI> way we <HI>Catholics</HI> on|ly take, and, as we think, prudently and surely.</P>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. 14.</HEAD>
<SP>
<P>For <HI>Sir,</HI> I beseech you to consider what a busy, laborious task you have undertaken by being a <HI>Protestant,</HI> of what <HI>Sect</HI> among them soever you are. Before you can promise to your self any rest of mind in the Peculiar <HI>Fundamental Doctrines</HI> of your <HI>Sect,</HI> your Conscience must satisfy you that you have not embraced a <HI>Religion</HI> by hazard, but after a diligent, sincere and effectual examination of all the <HI>Reasons</HI> and arguments, not only of <HI>Catholicks</HI> submitting to <HI>Authority,</HI> but also of other <HI>Sectaries,</HI> who proceeding your way of interpreting <HI>Scrip|ture</HI> by a private light, do condemn your <HI>Doctrines;</HI> or whose <HI>Do|ctrines</HI> you condemn. To be able to do all this, how many Volums of <HI>Controversy</HI> are you obliged to read and examine? Besides this, it will be absolutely necessary that you be perfectly studyed in all the Books of <HI>Scripture,</HI> with the best <HI>Commentaries</HI> on them, both <HI>Ancient</HI> and <HI>Modern</HI> since you ground your Religion upon a sense of Scrip|ture, which perhaps not any of them will allow, and then in equity you are to examine their reasons for it. Now what one mans age will suffice for all this business, though but in one or two <HI>Points</HI> contro|verted, and though the party were <HI>learned,</HI> and had never so much leasure? What then shall <HI>ignorant</HI> persons do, who yet make up the greatest number of <HI>Christians?</HI> What shall <HI>Trades-men</HI> and <HI>Day-La|bourers</HI> do? who can scarce allow from their necessary Vocations a|ny time at all dayly, even to say their Prayers? yet it concerns all these, upon the venture of <HI>Eternal Happiness</HI> or <HI>Misery,</HI> not to forsake or embrace a <HI>Religion</HI> without a sufficient Examination made by themselves of the grounds of it, since they are told, and believe it, that they must trust to themselves only because no <HI>external Authority</HI> upon Earth can require from them a submission of their judgment, inasmuch, as according to their general fundamental Positions, no <HI>Authority</HI> is <HI>infallible.</HI></P>

<P>Now whereas you said, That <HI>all Fundamental Doctrines of Christianity are so clearly set down in Scripture, that no sober Enquirer can be mistaken in them:</HI> If this were true, yet since neither the <HI>Scripture,</HI> nor you your selves, do clearly express which and how many <HI>Do|ctrines</HI> are <HI>fundamental,</HI> every tittle of <HI>Scriptures</HI> must be read and ex|amined by every one of you, for fear a necessary <HI>Doctrine</HI> should chance to escape you. But to demonstrate the groundlesness of that
<PB N="7" REF="6" MS="y">
your <HI>Assertion,</HI> I desire you to reflect on the prodigious multiplicity of <HI>Sects</HI> swarming in this age, all which ground their Belief upon pre|tended <HI>clear Texts of Scripture</HI> alone: you will then scarce find one <HI>Article</HI> of <HI>Christian Faith</HI> exempted from their <HI>Disputes. There are</HI> not wanting who deny the <HI>Mistery</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> the <HI>Divinity</HI> and <HI>Incarnation</HI> of our <HI>Lord,</HI> the <HI>Divine Personality</HI> of the <HI>Holy Ghost. Some</HI> absolutely deny <HI>Freewill,</HI> whilst <HI>others</HI> exalt the power of it so high, as to affirm <HI>Divine Grace</HI> unnecessary to its best Operations. <HI>Some</HI> affirm our Nature to be so incurably polluted by <HI>Original Sin</HI> as that all the best actions of the Regenerate are <HI>Mortal Sins; Others</HI> will acknowledge no <HI>Original Sin</HI> at all. <HI>Some</HI> affirm <HI>Baptism</HI> necessary to Salvation, even of <HI>Infants: Others</HI> reject <HI>Infant-Baptism:</HI> and <HI>Cal|vinists</HI> assert, that <HI>Infants</HI> without <HI>Baptism</HI> are sanctified by their <HI>Pa|rents faith:</HI> and that some <HI>Infants</HI> dying, though baptized may be damned. <HI>Some</HI> believe mans Soul to be mortal, and that it perisheth with the Body, not having any Knowledg or Sentiment after death: <HI>Some</HI> confine <HI>God</HI> to a determinate place in Heaven, and also deny his <HI>Prescience of future Contingents. Lastly some</HI> deny an <HI>Eternity of tor|ments in Hell.</HI> Surely you will not deny most of these to be contrary to <HI>Fundamental Doctrines</HI> of our <HI>Faith:</HI> yet all who maintain these <HI>Tenets,</HI> and all Sectaries who contradict them, do ground themselves upon <HI>express Scripture,</HI> which to you seems so clear. You cannot be more confident that you have light on the true sence of <HI>Scripture,</HI> than they of a contrary sense, and only <HI>self-love</HI> and <HI>selfe-esteem</HI> determine both the one and the other.</P>
<P>Can it then be prudence in any man to hazard <HI>Eternity</HI> upon his own sence of <HI>Scripture,</HI> the half of which perhaps he never read? Com|monly a <HI>Text</HI> or two concludes every point controverted, when per|haps there are twenty <HI>Texts,</HI> unconsidered by the Person, which would rectify the sence he gave to the former?

<P>Truly, Sir, I do not know through what <HI>Spectacles</HI> you look upon this <HI>principle</HI> of <HI>Protestancy,</HI> which hath been indeed the constant Principle of all <HI>Ancient-Herities.</HI> But to me it appears most horribly gastly, and only fit to be acknowledged the invention of <HI>Lucifer,</HI> the foul Spirit of <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>contention,</HI> who presents to unwary <HI>Christians</HI> once more this <HI>fruit of the Tree of the knowledg of good and evil,</HI> to be aspired to by our own endeavors, and contrary to <HI>Gods</HI> appoint|ment.</P>
<P>Since therefore (as hath been said) there are but those <HI>two ways</HI> to arrive at the knowleg of <HI>Divine Mysteries</HI> contained in <HI>Scripture</HI> (yet so contained as that the Texts in which they are contained are sub|ject to be miss-understood) <HI>viz. First,</HI> A man's own <HI>private Reason:</HI> And <HI>Secondly, Authority of Superiors</HI> by <HI>Gods</HI> appointment placed in his <HI>Church:</HI> All the <HI>Reason&punc;</HI> I have enforces me to chuse this latter way, because thereby I shall avoid inconstancy, otherwise unavoi|dable: as I am taught by <HI>St. Paul,</HI> who sayes, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 11, 12, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That therefore <HI>God placed in his Church Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers for the edification of the Body of Christ:</HI> a Succession of which is to last <HI>till we all meet in the Unity of Faith, &amp;c.</HI> This Al|mighty God did, says he, <HI>To the end we should not be like children, wa|vering, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, through the wicked|ness of men, and cunning of such as would circumvent us with errour:</HI> the only remedy whereof, in the Apostles judgment, is, submission to Authority. To which submission also I am obliged by an express com|mand of <HI>God</HI> [<HI>Obedite praepositis vestris,</HI> &amp;c.] Heb. 13. 17. <HI>Obey them that are set over you, and submit your selves, for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account</HI>&mdash;And <HI>Reason</HI> thus divinely enlightned, obliging me to submit to <HI>Authority,</HI> I should renounce the same <HI>Reason</HI> utterly, if I should not prefer that Society which (by an evident Suc|cession from the foresaid Apostles and Pastors) makes the best claim thereto; yea, which alone claims an Authority obliging the Consci|ence, and that is the <HI>Catholics Church;</HI> the <HI>Authority</HI> whereof is evi|dently the greatest in the world. For though all divided <HI>Sects</HI> pre|ume to contend with her for <HI>Truth</HI> of <HI>Doctrines,</HI> challenging <HI>that</HI> to
<PB N="9" REF="7" MS="y">
themselves; yet there is not any one of them which dares assume to themselves that <HI>eminence</HI> of <HI>Authority</HI> which manifestly appears in her. And you may know this <HI>Catholio Church</HI> from others, because it only challengeth an universal and <HI>absolute,</HI> not conditional <HI>Obedience;</HI> and you may know the <HI>Sons</HI> of it by their professing to give to the <HI>Church|es Authority</HI> such <HI>Obedience.</HI></P>

<P>Now, <HI>Sir,</HI> consider <HI>how</HI> agreeable to <HI>Gods goodness</HI> and <HI>wis|dom, how</HI> suitable to humane capacities, <HI>how</HI> helpful to mens neces|sities is this way of grounding our <HI>Faith</HI> on <HI>Gods Word</HI> as interpreted by the <HI>Catholic Church.</HI> The far greatest part of <HI>Christians</HI> are too weak to maintain Disputes: yet <HI>God</HI> loves the Poor and Ignorant, at least, as well as he does the Rich and Learned; and takes care to bring them to Happiness without Learning, sharpness of wit, curiosi|ty, and study of knowledg. Consequently he has chalked out a way to Heaven, in which the Ignorant and Simple may walk securely: And in what other way can these walk, but in that of <HI>obedience</HI> to <HI>Au|thority?</HI> This doubtless is that way foretold by the Prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> 35. 8. saying in Christs Kingdom, <HI>There shall be a high way&mdash;and it shall be called a holy way. No polluted person shall pass through it. This shall be</HI> [to Christians] <HI>a streight way, so that Fools shall not err in it.</HI></P>
<P>Now have <HI>Sectaries</HI> found out this <HI>streight way in which Fools cannot err? Sectaries,</HI> I say, who have framed a confused <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> in which there are a thousand cross paths and windings, where every one wan|ders, as it were, with a dark Lanthorn in his hand, and either stumbles into, or phantastically chuses such a path as at the present pleases him best, and leaves it also when he thinks good, not taking direction from any other, or not much caring for such directions. By this means we see how that not only <HI>Fools</HI> and Ignorant, but even the most Judicious a|mongst <HI>Sectaries,</HI> following their own light, do walk all their lives, in quite contrary ways, yet all believing that <HI>God</HI> by the <HI>Scripture</HI> directs them.</P>

<P>Manifest therefore it is, that <HI>Gods</HI> way being only <HI>one holy, streight High-way,</HI> not any <HI>Sectaries,</HI> but all and only Catholics have been by <HI>Almighty God</HI> brought into it: In as much as <HI>they,</HI> distrusting the dim <HI>Light</HI> of their own <HI>Reason</HI> for discerning the <HI>Verities of Faith</HI> contested, borrow the <HI>Churches Light:</HI> thus exercising <HI>Christian Hu|mility,</HI> in not presuming upon their own Abilities; and <HI>Christian Obe|dience,</HI> in submitting to the Guidance of those <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Governors</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="8" MS="y">
whom <HI>God hath placed over them, and who are to give an account of their souls,</HI> These Heavenly Virtues are, and have always been equally pra|ctised by both Ignorant <HI>Catholics</HI> out of necessity, and by the most <HI>Learned</HI> out of <HI>Duty:</HI> Yea, those glorious <HI>Lights</HI> of <HI>Gods Church,</HI> the <HI>holy Fathers</HI> and ancient <HI>Doctors,</HI> though they were <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Do|ctors</HI> to others, yet to the <HI>Church</HI> herself they were humble Children and <HI>Disciples,</HI> learning only from her, and teaching others only what they had learnt from her.

<P><HI>Sir,</HI> this is the ordinary artifice of your <HI>Protestant Writers,</HI> when they are pressed with the guilt of those unpardonable crimes of (<HI>Heresie</HI> and) <HI>Schism,</HI> to impute to the <HI>Church</HI> many Errors and sinful Practices, in which, foresooth, their tender consciences dare not joyn. This they do, to the end they may be dispenced withal from clearing themselves from <HI>Schism,</HI> till after a full discussion of all other <HI>Controversies</HI> touching differences about any particular <HI>Errors</HI> supposed to be in the <HI>Church;</HI> which discussion cannot be un|dertaken by one in a thousand, considering mens general incapacity; and if undertaken by the Learned, would scarce ever have an end.</P>
<P>But this is most unreasonable, because though it were true, that the <HI>Church</HI> from which they separated were indeed guilty of teaching <HI>Errors,</HI> yet are <HI>Protestants</HI> justly and unanswerably charged with <HI>Schism</HI> in a high degree, in as much as they remain divided, not from the <HI>Roman</HI> only, but all <HI>Patriarchal</HI> and all other <HI>Churches</HI> existent before their <HI>Separation:</HI> So that if there be such a Crime as Schism, they are manifestly guilty of it: and by consequence it would be damnable in any one to joyn in their <HI>Communion.</HI> To make this charge good against them, it will be fully sufficient to al|ledg the <HI>confession</HI> of all <HI>Christians,</HI> (and of <HI>themselves</HI> (also

<P>They were no sooner separated, but they heaped on the <HI>Church</HI> all the most despightful reproaches and Calumnies they could invent, and to heighten their <HI>Criminal Schism</HI> to the uttermost, they formed <HI>New Societies</HI> which they called <HI>Churches,</HI> and therein esta|blished <HI>New Pastors,</HI> and a <HI>New Ecclesiastical Ministry:</HI> (the very Sin for which <HI>God</HI> commanded the Earth to swallow <HI>Core, Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiron.</HI>) Amongst the <HI>Gifts</HI> which <HI>our Lord when he led captivity captive,</HI> received from his <HI>Father,</HI> and bestowed on his <HI>Church,</HI> the principal <HI>Gift</HI> mentioned by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> was his <HI>constituting therein A|postles, Pastors, and Teachers to continue to the end of the world</HI> by a legitimate Succession.

<P>For as much as concerns your <HI>Ordinations,</HI> I will not here enter into any dispute, neither indeed is it needful: But this I may confidently say, That since <HI>English Protestants</HI> have (especially of late,) by many tokens shewed that they esteem <HI>Calvinists,</HI> or <HI>Presby|terian Congregations</HI> to be true, though not so perfect, Members of <HI>Christs Church,</HI> as themselves; the <HI>English Church,</HI> I may say justifies, but however, qualifies or excuses that horrible defect in them of want of <HI>Ordinations</HI> and lawful <HI>Mission,</HI> and thereby involves her self in their guilt. <HI>Again</HI> though it were true, that the <HI>English Clergy</HI> have re|ceived their <HI>Ordinations</HI> from the <HI>Roman Catholic Church,</HI> yet sure I am, that <HI>Church</HI> never released them from their <HI>Canonical subjection</HI> to their <HI>Superiors,</HI> particularly to their <HI>Patriarch</HI> and <HI>Supream Pastor of Gods Church:</HI> She never gave them power to change the order of ad|ministring <HI>Sacraments;</HI> to reverse <HI>Ordinances</HI> of <HI>Superior Councils;</HI> to expel <HI>Catholic Bishops</HI> from their <HI>Sees,</HI> meerly because they were <HI>Ca|tholics;</HI> In a word, she never gave them authority to alter, or rather destroy, the whole <HI>Religion,</HI> in a manner, professed in <HI>England</HI> since they were first <HI>Christians.</HI> If <HI>English Bishops</HI> have received their <HI>Cha|racter</HI> from <HI>Rome,</HI> yet not <HI>Iurisdiction;</HI> or if that also, yet certain it is, that the same <HI>Church</HI> which gave them <HI>Iurisdiction,</HI> can also upon their demerits, and exercising it contrary to her intention, suspend the administration of it; which <HI>suspension</HI> is no doubt implyed in her condemnation of all their <HI>Innovations.</HI> To be brief, the <HI>English Church</HI> challenging <HI>Ordination</HI> by lawful <HI>Succession,</HI> is thereby obliged to acknowledg the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, to be at least a true <HI>Member</HI> of the <HI>Catholic</HI> Church, (and consequently her self no such Member) un|less the <HI>Bishops</HI> here will confess themselves to be <HI>Anti-Catholic</HI> Bi|shops, and yet most unreasonably pretend an Union with the <HI>Catholic Church.</HI></P>

<P>Consider, <HI>Sir,</HI> I pray you, that the <HI>Rule of Faith</HI> obligeth us to believe the <HI>Church of God</HI> to be <HI>Holy</HI> as well as <HI>Catholic.</HI> Now if the <HI>Universal Church</HI> be <HI>Holy</HI> or <HI>uncorrupt,</HI> then is every <HI>Member</HI> of

<P>Be pleased then to reflect on some Age, when these two <HI>great Churches</HI> were united: for example, in the days of St. <HI>Gre|gory the Great.

<P>The <HI>Prophesies</HI> themselves are thus expresly set down in the <HI>Old Tes|tament,</HI> and acknowledged by <HI>Protestants</HI> to regard the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> The Prophet <HI>Isai</HI> writes thus: <HI>Isa.</HI> 60. 2, 3. <HI>The Lord shall rise upon thee, and his Glory shall be seen upon thee.</HI> ver. 5. <HI>And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightness of thy rising</HI>&mdash;ver. 10. <HI>The abundance of the Sea shall be converted unto thee: the</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="14" MS="y">
<HI>forces of the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>shall come unto thee</HI>&mdash;ver. 11. <HI>The sons of Strangers shall build thy walls, and their Kings shall minister unto thee.</HI> ver. 14. <HI>Thy Gates shall be open continually, that men may bring unto thee the forces of the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>and their Kings may be brought&mdash;All they that despise thee, shall bow themselves at the soles of thy feet, and they shall call thee,</HI> The City of the Lord&mdash;ver. 22. <HI>A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong Nation.</HI> Again, <HI>Isai.</HI> 49. 23. <HI>Kings shall be thy nursing Fathers, and Queens thy nursing Mothers.</HI> And again <HI>Isai.</HI> 39. 21. <HI>This is my Covenant with them, saith the Lord, My Spirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</HI> Also the Kingly Prophet, <HI>Psal.</HI> 11. 8. <HI>I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy possession.</HI> This <HI>Kingdom,</HI> (saith the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI>) <HI>Shall not be given over to another people, but shall stand for ever,</HI> Dan. 11. 44. These are Gods Promises to his Church, so acknowledged by <HI>Protestants.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is manifest out of <HI>Ecclesiastical History,</HI> that these Prophe|cies began not, in a signal manner, to be accomplished, till the days of Saint <HI>Gregory.</HI> For during the first three hundred years, the Church was wholly under Persecution, and was encreased chiefly by sufferings. In the next three hundred years, the Emperour <HI>Con|stantine</HI> being converted to Christianity, there were but few other Kings <HI>Foster-fathers of the Church;</HI> And besides this, several of the Em|perours, and some Kings during that space, turned <HI>Arians</HI> and <HI>Apos|tates</HI> from the <HI>Catholic Faith.</HI> But from Saint <HI>Gregories</HI> time till <HI>Lu|ther,</HI> it is incredible almost what we read of the <HI>Conversion</HI> of Na|tions and Kingdoms, and of the wonderful Piety and zeal of (once Barbarous) <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Queens,</HI> assoon as they had embraced the <HI>Ca|tholic Faith.</HI> Which <HI>Conversions</HI> were generally made by the fervor, care, and authority first of St. <HI>Gregory</HI> himself; as <HI>England</HI> can, but most ungratefully will not, as becomes her, witness; and next of St. <HI>Gregories</HI> Successors, <HI>Bishops of Rome.</HI></P>

<P>These, <HI>Sir,</HI> among many other, are grounds surely sufficient to justifie the <HI>Right</HI> which the <HI>Roman Church</HI> has to merit your <HI>Obe|dience:</HI> I beseech you think seriously on them. For mine own part, I do sincerely protest to you, that unless I would renounce all other <HI>Guides</HI> to eternal Happiness, but an over-weaning <HI>Fancie</HI> of mine own abilities, or blind <HI>passion</HI> against all <HI>Guides</HI> establish'd in <HI>Gods Church:</HI> if <HI>Divine Revelation, consent of Antiquity, manifest Reason, and even experi|ence by outward Sensation</HI> may be fit to guide me, I must not be a <HI>Pro|testant,</HI> I must of necessity be a <HI>Roman Catholic.</HI> For <HI>Divine Revelation</HI> (interpreted also by consent of <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Councils</HI>) informs me, that <HI>Christ</HI> hath established on Earth a <HI>visible Church,</HI> which is, <HI>one holy</HI> and <HI>Catholic,</HI> the <HI>common Mother</HI> and only authentick <HI>Teacher</HI> of all <HI>Chris|tians; that</HI> this <HI>Church</HI> shall remain such to the end of the World: and <HI>that</HI> whosoever is not a true faithful <HI>Member</HI> of this <HI>Church,</HI> is thereby cut off from the <HI>Mystical Body</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and shall be eternally separated from <HI>Him. Again,</HI> evident <HI>Reason</HI> shews, that no Person, or <HI>Society,</HI> can be esteemed a <HI>Member</HI> of any <HI>Church</HI> any other way, than by believing its <HI>Doctrines,</HI> and being subject to its <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Go|vernment.</HI> In the <HI>third place,</HI> the <HI>testimony</HI> of our <HI>Senses</HI> assures us, that

<P><HI>Moreover, since</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> is that <HI>Church</HI> of which the <HI>first Reform|ers,</HI> once were <HI>Members,</HI> and by <HI>reforming</HI> made a <HI>separation</HI> from it, and <HI>since</HI> the <HI>same Church</HI> does constantly profess the same <HI>Doctrines</HI> which were once held by the <HI>Universal Body of Orthodox Christians;</HI> and again, <HI>since</HI> there is not any <HI>visible Church</HI> upon earth to which all <HI>marks</HI> of the <HI>true Church</HI> assigned in <HI>Scripture,</HI> and by the <HI>Holy Fathers,</HI> can be so applied, and whereto the <HI>Antient Prophecies</HI> and the <HI>Promises</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> have been so perfectly accomplished, as the <HI>Roman;</HI> it will evidently <HI>follow,</HI> that the <HI>present Roman Catholic Church</HI> ought to be acknowledged that <HI>one Holy Catholic Church,</HI> which we confess in the <HI>Apostles Creed</HI> and <HI>by consequence</HI> whatsoever <HI>Doctrines,</HI> in opposition to the <HI>Faith</HI> professed in this <HI>Church,</HI> are taught by <HI>Protestants,</HI> they are thereby, without any particular discussion, <HI>legitimately prejudged</HI> to be <HI>formal Heresies.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sir, Truth</HI> and a <HI>Good intention</HI> make me confident, that <HI>Di|vine Grace,</HI> which is <HI>Omnipotent,</HI> will accompany them. Whereas therefore you say, That <HI>Roman Doctrines are apparently,</HI> or evidently <HI>contrary to Scripture:</HI> I desire you to take into consideration that the same <HI>Roman Church,</HI> at the same time, both proposed the <HI>Belief</HI> of those <HI>Doctrins</HI> to your first <HI>Reformers,</HI> and also gave them the <HI>Scrip|tures,</HI> testifying that they were the infallible <HI>Word of God.</HI> There|fore certainly it was far from being evident to <HI>her</HI> that her <HI>Doctrines</HI> did evidently contradict <HI>Divine Revelation.</HI> Now you will not surely deny but that in the <HI>Catholic Church</HI> there are men as learned, and those in a far greater number, than among <HI>Protestants,</HI> Men, I say, who also make the <HI>Scriptures</HI> their principal study, and have pub|lished almost innumerable <HI>Commentaries</HI> on them; again, <HI>Men,</HI> of whom a great number live sequestred from the world, in an assiduous Practice of Spiritual <HI>Prayer,</HI> and therefore not likely to have their judgments perverted by worldly interests: Yet not any one of these does see, or but suspect that the <HI>Faith</HI> they profess is contradicted by <HI>Gods Word:</HI> on the contrary, they invincibly demonstrate, that the <HI>Church</HI> has been, as the only <HI>Depository</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> so likewise of the <HI>true Sence</HI> of it: How comes then that to be evident to you, which

is invisible to them? Which way went the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> from the whole <HI>Church,</HI> to inhabite a debauched <HI>incestuous Fryer,</HI> or a <HI>stigma|tized Pichard,</HI> upon whose credit doubtless you have taken up your <HI>Evidence?</HI> If they could have shewed you in <HI>Scripture</HI> such passages as these, <HI>The Pope is not the Supream Bishop and Visible Head of the Church: Bread by Sanctification does not become the Body of Christ; We ought not to confess our sins to Priests: Purgatory is a meer humane inven|tion: It is an injury to Christ to desire Saints, but none to desire Sinners, to pray for us,</HI> &amp;c. Such <HI>sayings</HI> indeed as these might have justifyed your charge against the <HI>Church,</HI> that she contradicts <HI>Scripture.</HI> But where are such sayings to be found, except it be in the <HI>Heretical Writings,</HI> of your <HI>Reformers?</HI> On the contrary, some <HI>Points</HI> contra|dictory to those are found litterally contained in <HI>Scripture;</HI> and to elude them you are foced to have recourse to <HI>figurative sences,</HI> and the rest are conveyed to us by the same <HI>Authority,</HI> by which we receive the <HI>Scripture</HI> it self, Yea by the <HI>Holy Fathers</HI> justified as consonant to <HI>Scripture:</HI> and however I suppose you will not say, that <HI>silence</HI> is e|quivolent to express contradiction. The utmost that you can say is, that perhaps you can produce now and then some scattered <HI>Texts</HI> of <HI>Scripture</HI> from which you can make a shew of arguing against some <HI>Tenets</HI> of the <HI>Catholic Church;</HI> But what will that avail you, since <HI>Pro|bability</HI> (as hath been said) will not excuse you for omitting a necessary <HI>duty</HI> of <HI>Obedience,</HI> and incurring the horible guilt of <HI>Schism.</HI> Where now do you see an evidence that the Church contradicts <HI>Scripture?</HI></P>

<P>That <HI>Promise</HI> I will now, with <HI>Gods</HI> assistance, dis|charge through all the <HI>Points</HI> mentioned by you in the beginning.</P>
<P>And first as touching the two first <HI>Points,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>The Churches Authority.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The Popes Universal Iurisdiction,</HI> &amp;c. enough hath been said in our former <HI>discourse.</HI> Yet for your further satisfaction I will enlarge my self a little more. Take therefore into your considera|tion that it is a <HI>Fundamental Truth</HI> agreed on by all <HI>Catholics,</HI> That <HI>the only Objects of Catholic Faith are such Divine Truths as are revealed in Gods Word, and also proposed to all by the Catholic Church to be believed by Divine Faith.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="23" MS="y">Now this general <HI>Ground</HI> being presupposed, in case any <HI>Contro|versies</HI> should arise touching the sence of any <HI>Divine Truths</HI> revealed, it is unquestionably necessary that some <HI>Means</HI> should be appointed by <HI>God</HI> to determine such <HI>controversies,</HI> and to prevent a dissipation of his <HI>Church</HI> by <HI>Heresies</HI> and <HI>Schisms.</HI> And what other <HI>Mean</HI> can be imagined efficacious hereto then what hath been taught and practised even from the <HI>Apostles</HI> time, and this declared by the Council of <HI>Trent. That no man trusting to his own prudence (or skill) shall presume to interpret Holy Scripture in matters of Faith or Manners pertaining to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conc. Trid.

<P>This is that which the <HI>Roman Catholic Church</HI> teaches concerning her <HI>Authority</HI> of interpreting controverted <HI>Texts</HI> of <HI>Scripture.</HI> No more then this is any <HI>Catholic</HI> obliged to believe. Now I leave it to your conscience whether you can think it a sufficient <HI>Ground</HI> for you to break from her <HI>Communion</HI> upon this quarrel, because she judges more fit that the judgment of the <HI>whole Body</HI> of <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Gover|nors</HI> appointed by <HI>God</HI> in her, should prevail against your single judg|ment, or that of a few <HI>Apostat-Ministers:</HI> Especially considering the <HI>Promises</HI> made by <HI>our Lord</HI> to his <HI>Apostles</HI> and their lawful <HI>Successors,</HI> that <HI>his Spirit should remain with them and direct them into all Truth, till the end of the world,</HI> so as that <HI>the gates of Hell</HI> (that is, say the <HI>Fa|thers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 16. 13.

<P>Let us next proceed to what the <HI>Church</HI> has determi|ned touching the <HI>Priviledges</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Prime Pastor</HI> the <HI>Bi|shop of Rome.</HI> Thus then we read in the <HI>Confession</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> collected by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bulla Pii<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> P. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Pope</HI> himself out of the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent, I acknowledg the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church to be the Mother and Mistress of all Churches: and I promise true Obedience to the Bishops of Rome, Successor of St.</HI> Peter <HI>Prince of the Apostles, and Vicar of Iesus Christ.</HI> Here the <HI>See Apostolic</HI> being acknow|ledged the <HI>Mother</HI> and <HI>Mistress</HI> of all <HI>Churches,</HI> and the <HI>Pope Vicar of Christ,</HI> his universal <HI>Iurisdiction,</HI> is therein acknowledged, which Jurisdiction, or <HI>Authority,</HI> we are not to suppose to be arbitrary and unlimitted: but (as we read in a Canon of the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Florence</HI> consented to by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conc.

<P>Now the necessity of such a <HI>standing Authority</HI> in <HI>Gods Church</HI> is thus grounded. The <HI>absolutely Supream Ecclesiastical Au|thority,</HI> against which can lye no <HI>Appeal,</HI> is confessedly residing in a <HI>lawful General Council,</HI> by which all <HI>Debates</HI> whatsoever may be de|termined, all necessary <HI>Laws</HI> enacted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But it being a matter of infinite difficulty, especially since the division of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> to bring together so vast an <HI>Assembly</HI> from all Regions, and yet <HI>Unity,</HI> essential to the <HI>Church,</HI> being always to be preserved, which cannot be done without a <HI>supereminent Goverment</HI> always existent, hence it is come to pass that the <HI>supream Bishop</HI> and <HI>Successor</HI> of the <HI>Prince of the Apostles,</HI> has even from the beginning been acknowledged this <HI>supereminent Governor</HI> through all the whole <HI>Church,</HI> to take care that the common established <HI>Laws,</HI> former <HI>Definitions</HI> and <HI>Decisions</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> be every where observed and professed; to prevent any innovations in <HI>Doctrine;</HI> and also to end <HI>Controversies</HI> among <HI>Catholics</HI> (if any arise) at least by silencing contentious <HI>Disputes</HI> till a <HI>General Council</HI> may further consider them: by which all Schisms are prevented; and also <HI>Heresies,</HI> that is any <HI>Doctrines</HI> that are de|clared by this supream <HI>Pastor</HI> contrary to former <HI>Church-definitions</HI> perpetually crushed: and lastly to judg <HI>in causis majoribus;</HI> when quarrels arise among <HI>Patriarks, Metropolitans,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus stands the case; and now I appeal to your own Conscience, whether you can imagine any other <HI>Expedient</HI> for preserving a ge|neral <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Unity in Gods Church:</HI> And whether if you were appointed, and also enabled, to frame such a <HI>Church</HI> as was neces|sarily to continue always <HI>One Body,</HI> Reason it self would not dictate the same Order to you. <HI>Experience</HI> shews that all <HI>Divisions</HI> both in the <HI>West</HI> and <HI>East</HI> are to be ascribed to mens renouncing <HI>Obedience</HI> to this <HI>Common Governor.</HI></P>

<P>Truly Sir, I cannot but acknowledg that to preserve <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> in so vast a Body as the <HI>Church</HI> is, there must of ne|cessity be a <HI>Government;</HI> and if <HI>Government</HI> then <HI>Subordination</HI> and consequently an established <HI>Supream Governor.</HI> And now methinks reflecting upon <HI>Ecclesiastical History,</HI> I see clearly that such an order|ly
<PB N="43" REF="24" MS="y">
<HI>Government</HI> was settled in the <HI>Church</HI> by the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves. For if, as some among us pretend, the same <HI>Apostles</HI> had intended no <HI>Supereminence</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> above <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and no degrees of au|thority among <HI>Bishops,</HI> it could not possibly have happened, that a few unarmed <HI>Bishops,</HI> not assisted by <HI>Secular Power,</HI> should, so im|mediately after the <HI>Apostles,</HI> have subdued such a world of <HI>Presbiters,</HI> formerly supposed their equals, to their <HI>Iurisdiction,</HI> and no marks be left in any antient <HI>Writers</HI> to shew that those <HI>Presbyters</HI> resisted, or so much as complained against such an <HI>usurpation</HI> and <HI>tyranny.</HI> And the like may be said touching the <HI>Subordination</HI> of simple <HI>Bishops</HI> to <HI>Metropolitans, Primate, Patriarks;</HI> and of all these to the <HI>Supream Pastor:</HI> Though probably those <HI>Titles</HI> came into the <HI>Church</HI> in po|steriour ages. Therefore upon due consideration I cannot deny but my aversion to such and so qualified an <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> as you say is moderated by the <HI>Churches Decision,</HI> is very much abated.</P>

<P>No, <HI>Sir,</HI> You go too fast: For, though I am perswaded that our first <HI>Reformers</HI> with all their <HI>Rhetoric</HI> should not have drawn me with them out of the <HI>Church,</HI> upon this <HI>Motive</HI> of opposing such an Authority in the <HI>Pope,</HI> as has been acknowledged by <HI>General Coun|cils,</HI> and the ordinary <HI>Exercise</HI> of it to be regulated by approved <HI>Canons,</HI> since, I suppose such <HI>Authority</HI> regards only <HI>Ecclesiastical Affairs.</HI> But your <HI>Church</HI> will not be contented with this: for she will extend it also to <HI>Temporal matters,</HI> even to the disposing of <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> deposing of <HI>Princes,</HI> absolving <HI>Subjects</HI> from their natural <HI>Allegiance</HI> expresly commanded in Holy Scripture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Where do you find that our <HI>Church</HI> invests the <HI>Pope</HI> with such an <HI>Authority?</HI></P>

<P>I cannot distinctly tell you that: but of this I am assured that the <HI>Pope</HI> challenges it, and as by <HI>Divine Right.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you ground such an assurance? you will not surely esteem this to be an irrefragrable <HI>Proof</HI> thereof, because some of his <HI>Predecessors</HI> have challenged it, when as for above a thousand years
<PB N="44" REF="25">
before them not any precedent <HI>Pope</HI> ever pretended to it.</P>
<P>But let it be supposed that the present <HI>Pope</HI> did now challenge it: Will you not live in a <HI>Community</HI> in which the <HI>Governor</HI> challenges more then you will grant to be his due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prot.</SPEAKER>
<P>No truly: especially if that <HI>Authority,</HI> to which he pretend|ed, endangers the ruine of <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> or the utter banishment of <HI>Peace</HI> every where. For such an <HI>Authority,</HI> I am sure, was never established on earth by our <HI>Saviour,</HI> who is the <HI>Prince of Peace.</HI> And that which makes me assured hereof is this, because if Christ had had such an intention of dissolving the <HI>Frame</HI> of all <HI>Civil Government</HI> through the world, he would have left in <HI>Scripture,</HI> or <HI>Tradition,</HI> most express proofs of such his will, in a matter of that infinite im|portance: whereas the quite contrary rather appears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say well. But will you run out of the <HI>Church</HI> in case a <HI>Pope</HI> should chance to challenge more then his due, when perhaps no obligation lies upon you to submit to such <HI>Authority</HI> challenged by him, or to acknowledg the justice of it?</P>

<P>What I acknowledg or disacknowledg is not ma|terial. But to rectify your mistake, I will sincerely acquaint you with the whole matter as it stands at this day: and thence you may collect what must be required from you, in case you are a <HI>Catholic.</HI></P>

<P>You will much oblige me therein.</P>

<P>Then, it cannot be denyed that (besides that <HI>Temporal Power</HI> indeed belonging to the <HI>Pope</HI> within his own <HI>Dominions,</HI> of which he is now the <HI>Temporal Soveraign</HI>) several <HI>Popes</HI> in former times have both Challenged, and actually exercised an unlimitted <HI>Temporal Iurisdiction</HI> over other <HI>Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Empires.</HI> Which <HI>Iurisdiction,</HI> if it hath not been expresly acknowledged as just, yet it hath been sometimes submitted to by <HI>Kings,</HI> either obnoxious and unable to resist, or desirous to make use of it for their own advan|tage against Enemies or Rebels. Several examples hereof remain in our <HI>Records,</HI> particularly during the <HI>Raigns</HI> of <HI>King Iohn</HI> and <HI>Henry the third.</HI> But generally <HI>Princes,</HI> when freed from such exigences, have resolutely and stoutly resisted such pretentions of the <HI>Roman Court.</HI></P>
<P>If we now descend to latter times, and cast our view on the pre|sent state of <HI>Christendom,</HI> we shall find <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>states</HI> so far from admitting such an exorbitant forrain <HI>Iurisdiction</HI> to be exercised or
<PB N="45" REF="25">
acknowledged within their <HI>Dominions,</HI> that not any of them will permit <HI>Rescripts, Bulls</HI> or <HI>Mandats</HI> from <HI>Rome,</HI> though regarding even Ecclesiastical affairs (unless touching private inferior persons) to be published, and much less executed within their <HI>states,</HI> till ex|amined and approved in their respective <HI>Councils.</HI></P>
<P>Nay more then this: even the <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>Reformation</HI> prescribed by the <HI>General Council of Trent,</HI> as far as they are suspected to en|trench upon the <HI>Temporal Power of Princes,</HI> have always been refused to be admitted in <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> not only knowing, but expresly allowing such refusal; as appears by the <HI>Bull</HI> of <HI>Pope Clement</HI> the eight sent to King <HI>Henry the fourth,</HI> at his reception into the <HI>Church,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perron in Ambass.</NOTE> and recited by <HI>Cardinal Perron</HI> in his Epistles: in which <HI>Bull</HI> we find this <HI>Clause; His Majesty shall effectually take order that the Council of Trent he published and admitted in all things, Excepting only (at your must earnest Supplication and Petition) those things, if there be any such, which cannot be put in execution without a real disturbance of public tranquility.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> likewise, though believed to be more com|plyant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. Margare|tae Guber|natricis ad Archi|episcopum Camerac. &amp; Re|sponsis e|jusd.</NOTE> with the <HI>Court of Rome,</HI> being sollicited by the <HI>Pope</HI> to publish and admit the same <HI>Council</HI> in his <HI>Belgick Provinces,</HI> though he wil|lingly yielded thereto, yet he did it not without this additional <HI>Clause</HI> adjoyned, <HI>Touching the Regalities, Rights, Prerogatives and Preeminences of his Majesty, his Vassals, Estates and Subjects; the Lay|cal Iurisdiction hitherto used, the Right of Lay-Patronage the Right of No|mination, Hearing of causes in the possessory matter of Benefices, Tithes possessed or pretended to by Seculars,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in regard of all such things his Majesties Intention is, that proceedings shall go on as hitherto they have done, without changing any thing at all,</HI> &amp;c. So necessarily scrupulous are <HI>Christian Princes</HI> to prevent the least diminution of their <HI>Tem|poral Rights</HI> and <HI>Priviledges.</HI></P>
<P>More lately likewise when certain <HI>Authors</HI> of one <HI>Order</HI> published several <HI>Treatises,</HI> in which they endeavoured to exalt to the height the <HI>Popes Iurisdiction Universal in Temporal affairs,</HI> those <HI>Books</HI> were censured and condemned by many <HI>Catholic Universities,</HI> and com|mitted to the fire by <HI>Public Authority,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> not being ignorant hereof. And moreover (which perhaps is yet more considerable) the <HI>Superior General</HI> of the said <HI>Religious Order,</HI> even in <HI>Rome</HI> it self, published an <HI>Edict</HI> (known to all <HI>Christendom</HI>) by which <HI>he strictly</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="26">
<HI>forbad his Subjects, under most heavy Censures, to maintain such a Tem|poral Iurisdiction of the Pope, either in Books, Sermons or Disputations.</HI> Now that which makes this so solemn a <HI>Prohibition</HI> of more weight is this, that whereas the foresaid <HI>Authors</HI> earnestly contended to prove that all <HI>Christians</HI> were obliged to believe the <HI>Popes Right</HI> to such <HI>Authority,</HI> as <HI>an Article of our Christian Faith,</HI> the said <HI>General&punc;</HI> by publishing his <HI>Prohibitory Edict,</HI> clearly shewed that he re|nounced the <HI>Belief</HI> of such a <HI>Doctrine:</HI> For otherwise, Who but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Antichrist</HI> would so severely under a penalty of <HI>Excommunication</HI> for|bid the teaching or defending an <HI>Article of Faith?</HI> And moreover in a <HI>General Chapter</HI> not long after assembled, the said <HI>Prohibition</HI> was ratified by all <HI>Superiors</HI> of the same <HI>Order,</HI> as their own <HI>Writers</HI> testifie.</P>

<P>I must needs confess that <HI>Christian Princes,</HI> and <HI>Subjects</HI> too&punc; are much beholding to that Worthy <HI>General</HI> for his prudence and zeal to prevent occasions of tumults and Seditions. Notwithstand|ing it seems to me that <HI>Princes</HI> are not yet secure: for though the said <HI>Doctrine</HI> should cease to be esteemed an <HI>Article</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> why may it not be defended as an <HI>Opinion,</HI> at least <HI>Speculatively probable?</HI> and if so, a slender <HI>Probability</HI> will have force but too great to raise and foment <HI>Rebellions,</HI> when discontents are multiplied among the people.</P>

<P>In the <HI>Eucharist</HI> the first matter of <HI>Dispute,</HI> and ground of the rest, is the <HI>Catholic Doctrine touching the Real Presence of our Lords Body on the Altar after Consecration of the Symbole,</HI> thus declared in the <HI>Council of Trent, I prosess that in the most Holy Sacrament of the Eu|charist is present truly and substantially the Body and the Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Iesus Christ: And that there is made a Conversion of the whole Substance of the Bread into his Body, and of the whole substance of the Wine into his Blood: Which Conversion the Catholic Church calls Transubstantiation.</HI></P>

<P>The next controverted Doctrine, regards the <HI>Ado|ration of Christ in the Holy Sacrament.</HI> Concerning which the sum of the <HI>Churches Faith</HI> is comprized in this her Decision; <HI>Whosoever shall</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Council.

<P>Now the Doctrine touching the <HI>Real Presence,</HI> being once esta|blished, will sufficiently justify this: for certainly it is not only law|ful, but our <HI>Duty</HI> to adore <HI>Christ</HI> whereever he is truly present. And consequently this <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Adoring our Lord in his Sacrament</HI> is by
<PB N="50" REF="28" MS="y">
the same <HI>Universal Tradition</HI> delivered, and ordained in all <HI>Publick Liturgies,</HI> both of the <HI>Grecian</HI> and other <HI>Oriental Churches.</HI></P>

<P>But the great, and too willing mistake of our <HI>Adversaries</HI> is, that they impute to us the <HI>Adoration</HI> of the <HI>Visible Elements:</HI> Whereas the proper <HI>Object</HI> of our <HI>Worship</HI> is not any Visible thing, Nay, we do not terminate our Worship percisely in the <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> which we beleive invisibly present: The proper <HI>Object</HI> of our <HI>worship</HI> is the <HI>Person of Christ God and Man</HI> veiled under the <HI>Visible Elements.</HI> So that in case it should happen through some incapacity in the Mini|ster, or defect in the manner or matter, that the Elements should not be effectually consecrated, and yet we, (beleiving <HI>Christs Body</HI> to be <HI>Sacramentally present,</HI>) should so worship him, in this indeed would be a circumstantial mistake, but here would be no <HI>Idolatry,</HI> nor in|deed any fault in us, the <HI>Errour</HI> being supposed undiscoverable by us. The reason is, because the Belief of the <HI>Presence of Christs Body</HI> is truly grounded on <HI>Divine</HI> Revelation; and not a fond fancy such as was that of the <HI>Manicheans</HI> worshiping <HI>Christ</HI> as peculiarly present in the <HI>Sun,</HI> or of the <HI>Isrealites</HI> conceiving <HI>God</HI> to be peculiarly present in the <HI>Calves at Bethel.</HI> And to this you may see <HI>Daille</HI> yeilding his consent, in his <HI>Apology</HI> for the <HI>Reformed</HI> Churches, the eleventh Chap|ter.</P>
<P>It is observable with what strange and unreasonable partiality the <HI>Calvinists</HI> treat <HI>Catholics</HI> in this <HI>Point:</HI> They give their judgment that there is no dangerous Venome in the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Lutherans</HI> touch|ing this matter, and therefore have <HI>Synodically</HI> granted them admission to their <HI>Cene</HI> which the <HI>Lutherans</HI> scorn. Now the <HI>Lutherans</HI> profess the <HI>Real Presence</HI> of <HI>Christs Body</HI> together with the <HI>Bread:</HI> and some of them acknowledg <HI>Adoration</HI> due to him there. So that to a <HI>Calvinists</HI> consci|ence the same, or a worse <HI>Doctrine</HI> held by a <HI>Sectary</HI> looses all its poyson: it is only dangerous to believe what the <HI>Church</HI> teaches.

<P>The next <HI>Point,</HI> with regard to the <HI>Holy Eucharist,</HI> quarrelled at by <HI>Protestants,</HI> is our <HI>Doctrine</HI> touching the <HI>Sacrifice of Christs Body on the Altar</HI> concerning which the summ of the <HI>Churches Decision</HI> is as followeth: <HI>I profess that in the Mass is offered to God a</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bull.

<P><HI>Protestants</HI> set themselves against this <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> upon a meer mistake of the <HI>Term,</HI> which they will needs affirm to imply an <HI>Im|molation:</HI> and thereupon argue, that the <HI>Roman Church</HI> manifestly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 9. 26. Ib. 28.</NOTE> contradicts the <HI>Authour</HI> of the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> who affirms that <HI>Christ hath now once in the end of the world appeared to put away sin by the Sacrifice of himself.</HI> And that <HI>he was once offered to bear the sins of many:</HI> and thence concludes the absolute <HI>Perfection</HI> of that <HI>one Sacrifice</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> once offered, which did not need be repeated, as the <HI>Legal Sacrifices</HI> did.</P>
<P>But this pretended <HI>Contradiction</HI> will quickly vanish, if we con|sider that though the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> made by <HI>Christ</HI> did accomplish all sorts of <HI>Sacrifices</HI> and <HI>Oblations</HI> in the <HI>Law,</HI> yet the forementioned <HI>Divine Authour</HI> in a special manner compares it to that great <HI>Anniversary Sa|crifice</HI> of general <HI>Propitiation,</HI> in which after the killing of the beast, the <HI>High Priest</HI> alone, and only once every year, carryed the <HI>Blood</HI> into the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> and there sprinkled it before <HI>God.</HI> In like manner did our <HI>Saviour</HI> after his bloody <HI>Sacrifice</HI> on the <HI>Cross,</HI> ascending into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Heaven</HI> by his own blood entered into the most <HI>Holy place, having ob|tained eternal redemption for us.</HI></P>
<P>Now these <HI>two Acts</HI> of <HI>Priesthood</HI> are by his commission in a sort, repeated by his <HI>Servants</HI> whom he hath ordained <HI>Priests</HI> in his <HI>Church,</HI> and who according to <HI>Saint Augustine's</HI> expression are [<HI>propriissime Sa|cerdotes</HI>] <HI>in a most proper Sence Sacrificing Priests.</HI> For answerably to the <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Immolation,</HI> their <HI>Sacrifice</HI> on the <HI>Altar</HI> is only <HI>Represen|tative</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="29" MS="y">
and <HI>Commemorative,</HI> and expressed by <HI>Seperating the Body from the Blood,</HI> Yet so, that it is not barely a <HI>Sign</HI> of <HI>Christs death,</HI> for that alone would not be sufficient to entitle it a <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> but it also con|tains the <HI>Victim</HI> whose death is represented.

<P>The last Subject of <HI>Protestants</HI> quarrels against the <HI>Church,</HI> with relation to the <HI>Holy Eucharist, is her Ordaining to the Laity, Communion under one Species only.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is acknowledged that, as our <HI>Saviour</HI> instituted this <HI>Sacrament</HI> in both <HI>Species,</HI> so for many ages together, it was, in <HI>public Commu|nions,</HI> received accordingly: I say, in <HI>Public Communions:</HI> for in other private occasions, as in <HI>Sickness,</HI> at <HI>Sea,</HI> and generally among the devout <HI>Inhabitants of Desarts,</HI> it was otherwise: yet these, re|ceiving in <HI>One Species</HI> only, did not esteem themselves deprived of any vertue pertaining to the integrity of the <HI>Sacrament:</HI> And the reason is, because they generally believed (as the Church has now declared) that <HI>it is most true, that as much is contained in each Species, as under both: for whole and entire Christ does exist under the Species of Bread, and under every particle of that Species: in like manner whole Christ does exist under the Species of Wine, and under its parts</HI> (when separated) Upon this ground the <HI>Church</HI> without intending the least prejudice to her <HI>Children,</HI> has thought fit, for avoiding many inconveniences and
<PB N="53" REF="29" MS="y">
irreverencies which did frequently occur by the negligence and con|fusion of such vast multitudes of <HI>Communicants</HI> receiving the <HI>Blood</HI> also, that all, excepting the <HI>Priest</HI> who celebrated, should content themselves in <HI>Public Communions,</HI> as from the beginning <HI>Christians</HI> did in Private, with our <HI>Lords Body</HI> only under the <HI>Species of Bread,</HI> which is not obnoxious to the like inconveniencies, considering that hereby they should not be loosers of any part of the <HI>Blessing.</HI></P>

<P>This regards the <HI>Holy Eucharist</HI> considered as a <HI>Sacrament.</HI> But as it is a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> both the <HI>Species</HI> are necessary to the constitution of it, it being ordained to represent the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> by shedding his <HI>Blood:</HI> Which representation is made by <HI>Consecreating</HI> and <HI>offer|ing</HI> both the <HI>Body and Blood separatly.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>The next <HI>Catholic Doctrine</HI> severely censured by you, as an invention of the <HI>Clergys ambition,</HI> is the <HI>Obligation imposed by the Ca|tholic Church on her subjects to Confess their Mortal sins, and to submit to satisfactions for them; according to this Canon, Whosoever shall deny Sa|cramental Confession to have been instituted by Divine Law, or to be neces|ary to Salvation: or shall affirm that the manner of Confession secretly to the Priest alone (which the Catholic Church from the beginning hath allways and still doth observe) is disagreeing from the institution and command of Christ, and that it is a humane invention; Let him be Anathema.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Confession of sins</HI> seems by this <HI>Canon</HI> referred to that <HI>Commission</HI> and <HI>Privilege</HI> given by our <HI>Saviour</HI> to his <HI>Apostles</HI> and their <HI>Successours, Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whose soever sins</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 22. 23.

<P>Now forasmuch as regards the proper, necessary sence of this <HI>Canon,</HI> those very <HI>Schoolmen</HI> who advance the virtue of <HI>Indulgences</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suarez.

That only such a Power of conferring In|dulgences has been left by our Lord to his Church as from ancient times has been practised and approved by former Synods, intending those that are u|sually cited to that purpose,</HI> as the <HI>first</HI> of <HI>Nicea,</HI> Can. 11. of <HI>Neocaesare</HI> Can. 3. of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> Can. 1. and 2. the <HI>Fourth</HI> of <HI>Carthage,</HI> Cap. 75. and of <HI>Agdes,</HI> Can. 6. in all which <HI>Synods</HI> we only find this, that it was always lawful and usual for <HI>Bishops</HI> to remit to their <HI>Penitents</HI> some part of those <HI>Canonical Penances</HI> which were inflicted for certain crimes, in case the life and laudable conversation of the
<PB N="56" REF="31" MS="y">

<P>Hence appears that whatsoever beyond this we read in the <HI>Catholic Writers,</HI> as thouching the remission of any pane due to Sin in the judg|ment of <HI>God,</HI> or after death in <HI>Purgatory,</HI> or touching certain clauses in the <HI>Bulls</HI> of some <HI>Popes;</HI> or touching the <HI>Churches Treasure</HI> consist|ing of the Merit of Christ alone, as some, or of the <HI>Merits</HI> of <HI>Saints</HI> joyned to those of <HI>Christ,</HI> as others conceive, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not any of these are necessary <HI>Points</HI> of <HI>Catholic Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Thus in effect the <HI>Catholic Church</HI> requires no more to be assented to, but what is taught and practised by every <HI>Congregation</HI> of <HI>Chris|tians</HI> upon <HI>Earth.</HI> All <HI>Sects,</HI> even <HI>Fanatics</HI> and <HI>Quakers,</HI> denounce <HI>Censures</HI> against <HI>Delinquents.</HI> Must all those <HI>Censures</HI> alwayes have their full effect?

I told you that several <HI>School-men</HI> in their <HI>Speculations</HI> do attribute more to <HI>Indulgences</HI> then the <HI>Church</HI> gives them warrant for? and this they themselves acknowledg. So it fares in all <HI>Religions,</HI> that <HI>Opinions</HI> do in number far exceed <HI>Articles of Faith.</HI> No wonder therefore if <HI>Popes</HI> do enlarge their <HI>Graces</HI> ac|cording to the measure of <HI>Opinions,</HI> not condemned. And who justly blame them, since they themselves reap no profit by all the <HI>Alms</HI> given? Indeed in the former <HI>Ages</HI> great <HI>Scandal</HI> was given by the avarice of such as published <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and collected the chari|table

<P>Matters standing thus, what harm flows to any by <HI>Indul|gences</HI> so published? Though perhaps not one in a hundred gains the full vertue of such <HI>Indulgences,</HI> yet something they do certainly gain; some reward they will reap from performing the good acti|ons enjoyned, which probably would otherwise never have been done by many. However, they loose nothing at all. They are taught, not to expect remission of unrepented sins, or to gain <HI>Heaven</HI> by an <HI>Indulgence:</HI> for none are capable of the fruit thereof, but such as have with <HI>Contrition</HI> confessed their sins&punc; and received <HI>absolution,</HI> and consequently are in the state of <HI>Grace,</HI> but yet remain obnoxious to temporal punishments, from which an <HI>Indulgence,</HI> duely made use of, doth free them.</P>

<P>One incommodity indeed may justly be apprehended by a too profuse and frequent concession of <HI>Indulgences,</HI> which is <HI>the enervating of Ecclesiastical Discipline:</HI> to prevent which the <HI>Church</HI> (as I said in the entrance into this Point) expresly and earnestly <HI>admo|nishes</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid: Sess. 25.</NOTE> <HI>that the granting of them may be done with great moderation ac|cording to the antient and approved Custom of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>Now If all this care will not yet satisfy you, however surely you will have no excuse for leaving the <HI>Church</HI> upon this account, because though there be never so many mistakes or abuses in the ordinary teach of <HI>Private Doctors,</HI> and common practice about <HI>Indulgences,</HI> you will not need to concern your self in any of them; since if you think fit, you may keep your money in your purse, perform your <HI>Devotions</HI> in your private Closet, endeavour to fulfil all <HI>Canonical Penances</HI> which have been, or, by the utmost rigor of <HI>Ecclesiastical Discipline,</HI> ought to have been imposed on you for all your sins, and so freely abstain all your life time from making use of an <HI>Indul|gence,</HI></P>

it will be seasonable and proper to treat of the <HI>Fruit</HI> arising from, or by occasion of them, which is the <HI>Merit of Good Works</HI> and <HI>Iustification.</HI> There is scarce any <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>Catholic Doctrine</HI> from which <HI>Protestants</HI> have sought greater advantage to multiply foolish <HI>Books</HI> and senceless <HI>Sermons,</HI> then this touching <HI>Iustification:</HI> and oft it falls out that their zealous <HI>Invectives</HI> against the <HI>Church</HI> are then most loudand bitter, when explaining themselves, they presently agree with the <HI>Churches sense.</HI> Of this, as soon as I have sincerely acquainted you with our <HI>Catholic Doctrine,</HI> I am content you should be the Judg.</P>

<P>First then, it is acknowledged that the <HI>Church</HI> teaches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council. Trid. Sess. 6. can. 11.</NOTE> That <HI>men are justified (indeed) by the imputation of Christs Iustice, and by Remission of their sins; but not by these only, so as to exclude Grace and Charity shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost:</HI> that is in effect, That <HI>God</HI> does not justify nor remit sins to persons while they per|sist in their sins and in a hatred of <HI>him.</HI> Again the <HI>Church,</HI> making use of the ordinary expression of the <HI>Holy Fathers,</HI> teaches, <HI>That a</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. can, 34,</NOTE> <HI>person justified truly merits eternal Life by his good Works.</HI></P>
<P>Now this word <HI>Merit</HI> (the word, I say, but not the true sense of it when they will permit us to explain it) is very offensive to <HI>Pro|testants.</HI> But you having obliged your self to avoid partiality, will judg of the <HI>Churches sense</HI> by what she further adds for explication of this <HI>Point;</HI> and for clearing her self from the imputation of en|couraging men to glorify themselves, and to trust in their own a|bilities for purchasing remission of sins and salvation.</P>

<P>Thus then <HI>she</HI> further teaches, <HI>it is necessary to believe that</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. c. 9.</NOTE> <HI>sins neither are, nor ever have been remitted, but by Divine Mercy free|ly</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. c. 8.</NOTE> <HI>extended to us, for</HI> (the merits of) <HI>Iesus Christ. Again, We are said to be justified freely because not any of those things which precede our Iu|stification, whether Faith or Works, can merit that Grace.</HI> In the third<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. c. 16.</NOTE> place, <HI>Eternal life ought to be proposed to the Children of God, both as a free Grace mercifully promised to them through Iesus Christ; and also</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>as as a Recompence which is faithfully rendred to their Good Works and Merits, by vertue of that Promise.</HI> Fourthly <HI>although in Holy Scriptures so much is attributed to Good Works, that Iesus Christ himself promises that a Cup of cold water given to the poor shall not fail of a Reward, and that the Apostle testifies that our light and momentary tribulation worketh fur us a far more exceeding, eternal weight of glory; Yet God forbid that a Christian should either trust or glory in himself, and not in the Lord,</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="32">
<HI>whose Goodness towards all men is so great that he is pleased, that the Free Gifts bestowed by him on them should be their Merits.</HI> I will add only one passage more, out of a great heap, to the like effect. <HI>We,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib.

<P>Thus are we instructed by the <HI>Church</HI> in the <HI>Council of Trent</HI> and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Can. Miss.</NOTE> moreover in the <HI>Canon</HI> of the <HI>Holy Mass</HI> we are taught thus to pray. <HI>Mercifully vouchsafe, O God, to admit us into the Society of thy Apostles and Martyrs, not weighing our Merits, but pardoning our offences through Iesus Christ.</HI></P>

<P>Can you now say, <HI>Sir,</HI> that the <HI>Roman Church</HI> teacheth her Children to glorifie themselves, and to rely upon their own <HI>Me|rits,</HI> or indeed to esteem their <HI>Merits</HI> to be their own? she must cancel the whole <HI>Scripture</HI> if she would affirm that <HI>without</HI> a good life and <HI>Holiness we may see God:</HI> Or if she would affirm that <HI>God</HI> has not obliged himself by a world of <HI>Promises</HI> to reward our Good Works with Happiness infinitely exceeding the value of them.</P>
<P>But withal to preserve in our hearts that most essential virtue of our <HI>Christian Professor, Humility,</HI> She further <HI>instructs us, that</HI> our Works as <HI>Merits,</HI> are the <HI>pure free Gifts</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and effects of his meer <HI>Grace,</HI> which alone affords them all their value: <HI>That</HI> they are accepted and rewarded by <HI>God,</HI> only for the <HI>Merits</HI> of <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI> Yea further, <HI>that</HI> our Natural Corruption still remaining, and ming|ling it self in our best actions, we can have no assurance that they are indeed such as <HI>God</HI> has promised to reward: And however, that though we now stand, yet we have no assurance that we shall not fall.

<HEAD>11. Of Invocation of Saints.</HEAD>
<HEAD>&sect;. 91.</HEAD>
<SP>
<P>The next <HI>Point</HI> censured by you is the <HI>Churches Doctrine</HI> touching <HI>Invocation of Saints:</HI> thus expressed in the <HI>Council of Trent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concil. Trid. Sess. 25.</NOTE> <HI>It is good and profitable to call upon the Saints, and to have recourse to their prayers, aid and assistance, whereby to obtain from God many benefits by the Merits of his Son Iesus Christ, who is our Redeemer and Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>In this <HI>Point</HI> I shall briefly offer to you these considerations; 1. That it is a general <HI>Tradition</HI> of <HI>Gods Church</HI> from the begining, and not contradicted by sober <HI>Protestants,</HI> that glorified <HI>Saints</HI> do in|cessantly Pray for the Militant <HI>Church</HI> on earth. 2.

That it contradicts all reason and modesty in our <HI>Adversaries</HI> to charge the addressing our <HI>Petitions</HI> to them for that purpose with the horrible crime of <HI>Idolatry,</HI> since we do no otherwise beg the <HI>In|tercession</HI> of <HI>Saints,</HI> then we do that of our sinful Brethren alive, ac|knowledging <HI>God</HI> alone to be the Author and fountain of all good.</P>

<P>Hence it follows that the worst title that malice it self can
<PB N="61" REF="33" MS="y">
with any shew of reason affix to this our Practice is, that it may be esteemed <HI>superfluous,</HI> in case it can be demonstrated, that <HI>Saints</HI> at such a distance cannot hear nor know our <HI>Requests</HI> in particular. Yet neither would this enervate the <HI>Churches Doctrine</HI> or <HI>Practice;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ius.</NOTE> which by eminent <HI>Divines</HI> is proved to be laudable and profitable, though they did not always hear us: neither indeed has the <HI>Church</HI> any where determined her Belief, that they do so. But <HI>lastly,</HI> if it be the <HI>Church</HI> her self, and not some private <HI>Catholic Writers,</HI> that you would question about this Subject; observe, that in her public <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Mass,</HI> celebrated on all the <HI>Feasts</HI> of <HI>Saints,</HI> she continually addresses her <HI>Petitions</HI> directly to <HI>God</HI> alone, desiring him to grant us such special <HI>Blessings</HI> by the <HI>Intercession</HI> of such and such <HI>Saints.</HI> Now it cannot be doubted but that <HI>Charity</HI> and mutual assistance among fellow members of the same Body is very acceptable to <HI>God</HI> whensoever and wheresoever performed. We are taught to <HI>beleive a Communion of Saints:</HI> we doubt not of their Charity to us: our <HI>Communion</HI> therefore with them must be to testify our joy for their <HI>Happiness,</HI> and our assurance that their <HI>Intercessions</HI> for us are more prevalent with <HI>God,</HI> then the <HI>Prayers</HI> of our living imperfect Brethren: Therefore since we may and ought, on occasions to beg these, and to desire <HI>God</HI> to hear them for our good, much rather surely ought we to do the same with regard to the glorified <HI>Saints.</HI> I leave it therefore to your conscience whether you can judg that a separation from <HI>Gods Church</HI> on this quarrel can be justified.</P>

<P>Your partiality is likewise very unreasonable in this mat|ter.

Yet because <HI>Calvin</HI> will not call this his fancied place, <HI>Pur|gatory,</HI> he is <HI>Orthodox,</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI> only erroneous.

<P>The <HI>first</HI> then that I will mention shall be the <HI>Church|es Ordinance</HI> touching <HI>Celibacy</HI> of <HI>Priests.</HI> It is confessed by us that this is only an <HI>Ecclesiastical Constitution:</HI> It is also confessed by the most eminent among you, that if your <HI>Clergy</HI> would submit to such a <HI>Constitution, Ecclesiastical affairs</HI> would be better ordered.

<P>When a <HI>Catholic</HI> is examined why he is so, an <HI>Answer</HI> is readily suggested to him, that it concerns the safety of his Soul to be a member of that <HI>Church</HI> which from his <HI>Creed</HI> he learns to be <HI>Holy and Catholic:</HI> and that the <HI>Roman</HI> is such, having all the <HI>Marks</HI> by which the only <HI>true Church</HI> is characterized in <HI>Scripture.</HI> He answers, directly to the <HI>Question,</HI> without comparing particular <HI>Tenents</HI> of his <HI>Church</HI> with those of other divided <HI>Congregations,</HI> which requires much Study and learning beyond the ability of ordinary <HI>Catholics:</HI> whereas the most simple are unquestionably perswaded of the <HI>Au|thority&punc;</HI>

<P>But a <HI>Protestant</HI> being examined, <HI>Why</HI> (for example) <HI>he is Member of the Church of England,</HI> it never enters into his thoughts to justify his <HI>Church</HI> by the <HI>Marks of Unity, Antiquity, Succession, Universality, &amp;c.</HI> nor does he pretend that his <HI>Church</HI> has any <HI>Au|thority</HI> from <HI>Christ</HI> to oblige him to believe <HI>her</HI> rather then any <HI>Fa|natic Congregations;</HI> for <HI>she her self</HI> will not suffer him to say so.

<P>And this <HI>illogical Method, Sir,</HI> you have observed in this <HI>Discourse:</HI> and as <HI>illogical</HI> as it is, I am confident you cannot mend it: for doubtless if you could have furnished your self out of your <HI>Anti-ca|tholick Writers,</HI> or if your self could invent any specious <HI>Arguments</HI> to recommend to any mans liking, or esteem the <HI>Church</HI> of which you profess your self a <HI>Member,</HI> you would not have neglected the doing it; you would not have been quite silent in the only matter which you were concerned to prove.</P>

<HI>Religion use to fright away such as making onquiry into it, are ready to relinquish and oppose it, if it either appear erroneous, or suspicious, Where|as whosoever shall, with a true and unpretended Conscience, perswade him|self, or but suspect, that the Church requires a Profession of false Doctrins, or conformity to&punc; unlawful Practises,</HI> [<HI>and of this each particular person must be the Iudge</HI>] <HI>in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ch a case he not only may, but is, obliged to separate from the Church: and by such Separation not he, but the Church, is guilty of Schism.</HI> Now, <HI>Sir,</HI> is not this <HI>Prinoiple</HI> a <HI>Preservative</HI> of soveraign virtue against all remorse of Conscience for <HI>Schism</HI> or <HI>Heresie?</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cath.</SPEAKER>
<P>I readily enough grant, that in such a Case the man must neither profess, nor do any thing against his present conscience: And consequently, I do not say, he must separate, but if the <HI>Church</HI> for his obstinate disobedience shall cast him out, he must be pa|tient. But the truth is, his case is deplorable, for every way he is exposed to extreamest danger. If he conforms against Conscience, he sins mortally by damnable <HI>Hypocrisie.</HI> If he refuses to conform, that is, to submit his private <HI>perswasion,</HI> or <HI>Suspicion,</HI> to the <HI>Teaching</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> [I mean, the <HI>Catholic Church</HI>] his sin is yet more heynous, be|ing a rebellious <HI>Disobedience</HI> to the highest and <HI>most Divinely establish|ed Authority</HI> upon Earth, from the guilt of which <HI>Disobedience</HI> no dictates of consoience, how unpretended soever, can acquit him. Otherwise none but false Hypocrites and subtle pretenders of con|science can be guilty either of Schism or Heresie: yea, the prouder menace, the more self-conceited of their own judgments, and more addicted to entertain suspition and contempt of their Superiors, the more innocent they shall be. So that a full <HI>perswasion,</HI> or it seems, but <HI>suspition</HI> that any <HI>Heretical Doctrines</HI> are <HI>Orthodox,</HI> will excuse all Heretics, even the most blasphemous, from all guilt and danger, and moreover, at the end of the account the <HI>Governours</HI> and law|ful <HI>Teachers</HI> appointed by <HI>God</HI> in his <HI>Church,</HI> in case the excommu|nicate such <HI>Orthodox Hereticks,</HI> must alone be esteemed <HI>Heretics</HI> and <HI>Schismatics,</HI> only for teaching Truth and doing their Duty.</P>

<P>Indeed, if he who called <HI>Schism</HI> a <HI>Theological Scar-crow</HI> had intended to apply that Expression to single divided <HI>Churches,</HI> whose birth has perhaps been within mans memory, and particular|ly to the <HI>Church of England</HI> (some Fundamental <HI>Doctrines</HI> whereof,
<PB N="71" REF="38">
to my knowledge, he did not assent to, and whose <HI>Ecclesiastical Go|vernment</HI> he did not approve) his <HI>Assertion</HI> may be justified to be grounded on Reason. For who can tell how a <HI>Seperation</HI> from any of them can be called <HI>Schism;</HI> or <HI>Tenents</HI> contradicting their <HI>Heresies?</HI> They all mutually favour one another with the Title of <HI>Pure Reformed</HI> and Sufficiently <HI>Orthodox Churches:</HI> So that in which soever among them any one shall live, and from which soever of them any one shall think fit to depart, as liking another better, this, according to their common grounds, must be accounted a matter in a manner, indifferent, and however there is in it no danger of incurring the guilt of <HI>Schism,</HI> so it be done with an <HI>unpretended Conscience.</HI> It seems therefore to me an Act unjust and unsuitable to the grounds of <HI>Pure Reformation</HI> in some late <HI>Prelatical Writers,</HI> who charge with the Crime of <HI>Schism</HI> their tender Conscienced <HI>Orthodox Brethren</HI> for deserting their <HI>Communion:</HI> as it was anciently in the <HI>Donatists,</HI> those <HI>Arch-contri|vers</HI> of <HI>Schisms</HI> for doing the same to the <HI>Primianists, Maximianists</HI> and <HI>Rogatists,</HI> subdivided <HI>Sects,</HI> Spawned from them.</P>
<P>It is plain therefore that among all <HI>Reformed Congregations, Schism</HI> is a meer <HI>Scar-crow,</HI> and the like may be said of <HI>Heresie:</HI> And the reason is, because both <HI>Heresie</HI> and <HI>Schism</HI> must include an opposition to that <HI>Church</HI> only which can justly challenge an <HI>Authority</HI> to deter|min what <HI>Doctrins</HI> are true and necessary to be believed by all <HI>Christi|ans,</HI> and to oblige all under penalty of <HI>Anathema's</HI> to joyn in her <HI>Com|munion:</HI> Which <HI>Authority</HI> only belongs to the <HI>Catholic Church,</HI> and which is not so much as pretended to by any <HI>Reformed Congregations.</HI></P>

Where shall we find an usurping Oppressor acknowledge himself Covetous? or an ambitious man, proud? So never did any <HI>Schismatic</HI> say, or think himself Such.
