<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Countrymen and Friends!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHiles in my retired condition, I was late|ly devising, how I might do some good to the place of my <HI>Nativity,</HI> I had a strong apprehension, from the affections many of you have express'd to my <HI>Fathers Family,</HI> that some of the Labours of my dear Brother Mr. <HI>Thomas Adams,</HI> now with God, would be very accepta|ble to you, for the edification of your souls; and there|upon as most generally useful for <HI>you:</HI> I resolv'd to be at the charge of Printing this <HI>Catechetical Explanation</HI> of <HI>His.</HI> 'Tis well known amongst you, that my Grandfather Mr. <HI>Ri|chard Adams</HI> was <HI>Rector</HI> of your Church, and then by his purchase <HI>Patron</HI> of the <HI>perpetual Advowson, Six</HI> of his Line and Name since all devoted to the <HI>Ministry of the Gospel, viz.</HI> Mine honoured Father Mr. <HI>Charles Adams,</HI> and Uncle Mr. <HI>Randal Adams</HI> (yet I hope alive in <HI>Ireland</HI>), <HI>my self,</HI> and three Brothers, <HI>Peter, Thomas,</HI> and <HI>Charles Adams</HI> were born in the Personage-house <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 87.5, 6.</NOTE>. My dear Mother (who also bore two other of my Brothers, <HI>viz. Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> there too) the Daughter of a worthy Gentleman was likewise born in your Parish. My Reverend Father and Uncle did some short part of their time exercise their Ministry a|mongst you; and all of us Brethren in the Ministry, have preached an occasional Sermon or more to you, though none of us could be setled with you, to spend our selves and be spent amongst you. However, we that are alive and at a distance from you, do often bear you upon our hearts, and earnestly desire that you may be <HI>saved in the day of our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> Some of you cannot but re|member, whiles my dear Father had the charge of your
<PB N="II" REF="3">
Souls, he did preach the Gospel to you, both <HI>in season and out of season, beseeching you to be reconciled to God,</HI> who soon took him off from that work with you, to his <HI>eternal rest.</HI> And I do assure you, my Brother (whose sound and whole|some fruit you may here taste) was very solicitous, and so are those who yet survive, that you may be acquainted with the <HI>truth as it is in Iesus.</HI> In order whereunto, I do now present and heartily recommend to you, this short <HI>Manual of Christian Doctrine.</HI> I pray you be pleased to re|ceive it kindly, and entertain it friendly; not only out of love to the <HI>Author</HI> or <HI>Donor,</HI> but to the Truth. It is prover|bially said amongst you [<HI>Cheshire Chief of Men</HI>], there ha|ving anciently been <HI>valiant</HI> ones born and bred there: Let not now any Prophet of the Lord have occasion to com|plain of you, that <HI>none are valiant for the truth</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ier.</HI> 9 3.</NOTE>; which none can be as they ought, unless well-trained, instructed, or <HI>Cateehised</HI> (as <HI>Abrahams</HI> brave ones <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 14.14.</NOTE> were for the war) in the mysteries of the Gospel; for <HI>lack of knowledg</HI> where|in, a professing people <HI>will be destroyed</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hos.</HI> 4.6.</NOTE> <HI>Being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, be|cause of the blindness of their heart</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> 4.18.</NOTE>. <HI>He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> 27.11.</NOTE>. To prevent this mischievous ignorance, and help your understandings that you may rightly <HI>know</HI> God and <HI>do</HI> his will. <HI>Such as I have, give I you.</HI> Let none then despise this <HI>small</HI> token of my love, which I do in the <HI>name of Iesus Christ</HI> send to you. Others of their <HI>plenty</HI> have formerly given to the meaner sort of you <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Bread</HI> for the <HI>body,</HI> and lately <HI>Means</HI> for the instructing the <HI>Minds</HI> of your Children in the Rudiments of <HI>Learning</HI>; now I do offer a <HI>Mite</HI> out of my <HI>penury,</HI> to establish your hearts in <HI>Religion</HI>;<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Act.</HI> 3.6.</NOTE> spiritual milk <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.12.</NOTE>, and bread <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 4.4. <HI>Amos</HI> 8.11.</NOTE>, which I know you have need of. It comes not to eat your <HI>Bread,</HI> but to distribute something of the <HI>bread of life</HI> to every Family. I expect you should bid it welcome, and not distaste it, as the <HI>Gaderens</HI> for the sake of their Hogs, did the com|pany of Christ himself, wishing him to leave their Coasts <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luk</HI> 8.26, 37. &mdash;9, 5. &mdash;10, 11, 12.</NOTE>. Lest coming in kindness to you <HI>all</HI> at <HI>this day,</HI> it should be
<PB N="III" REF="3">
a Testimony against <HI>any</HI> of you at the <HI>great day</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 10.14, 40, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. Believe me! I would not have it as the <HI>Flying Roll</HI> in the <HI>Prophets Vision,</HI> to consume any House whereinto it doth enter <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zach.</HI> 5.</NOTE>; but to warn every person and every family of you, in this crooked generation, to flee from the wrath to come, and meet God by repentance. I confess it would trouble me to come into any of your Houses (or have tydings there|of) and find this <HI>little Book,</HI> designed for your good, to be carelesly thrown up and down, and given to little ones to play with, and tear in pieces; or the leaves cut out with a knife, and burnt, as the <HI>Book</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ier.</HI> 36: 23.</NOTE> that <HI>Baruch</HI> wrote from the mouth of the Prophet <HI>Ieremiah</HI> was misused; and mostly for the sake of those careless and untoward ones. Yet if one sinner be reclaimed by it from the error of his ways, built up in faith, and love, and brought really to obey the Gospel, that will answer all my cost, and be abundant matter of much joy. <HI>But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.3:</NOTE>. However I may in some sort say with the <HI>Apostle</HI> for his <HI>Countrymen, Brethren, my hearts desire and prayer to God for you, is, that you may be saved.</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> 10.1.</NOTE> I shall therefore take the freedom upon this occasion to enlarge something under these three following heads, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Concerning the necessity of instructing, and being instructed in the Doctrine which is according to godliness.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The import and advantage of this Book before you, and how you may particularly use and improve it.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Some general Rules consonant to Scriptures, and the Mate|rials of this Book grourded thereon, to help you all in your Practise.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>necessity of instructing,</HI> or Catechising, both as it respects those who <HI>Teach,</HI> and those who are <HI>Taught</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> 6.6.</NOTE>, is evi|dent from the <HI>Injunction</HI> of the supream <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> who doth frequently charge Superiours to teach, and Inferi|ours to learn <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 11.18, 19, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;6.6, 7, 8. &mdash;4.9. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Isa.</HI> 28.10. <HI>Ex.</HI> 13.8. <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.5. <HI>Prov.</HI> 22.6.&mdash;29&punc; 3.&mdash;10.1.&mdash;1.10.&mdash;4.1, 2. <HI>Col.</HI> 3.11, 12. <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.18, 19. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.5. with 3.15, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. Which strongly obligeth those who have others under their authority, to do it as they are able; and (if they cannot read themselves) to put those who
<PB N="IV" REF="4">
have learn'd to read upon the work, and see them do it to the utmost of their power for edification. To strengthen this charge of so great and useful importance, the Spirit of God doth highly commend the practice according to it, as that wherein he much delighteth; and therefore makes it necessary to us, who should be solicitous to please him; yea in the Families wherein we live, as well as in the Con|gregation; as a <HI>part</HI> of that <HI>solemn service</HI> he hath appoint|ed in his word, with Prayers and Praises. Unless persons learn the <HI>Principles of Christian Doctrine</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.3, 4, 5. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 8.29.</NOTE>, they will not be able to hear Sermons with profit, nor understand <HI>clearly</HI> and <HI>distinctly</HI> the nature of <HI>Faith, Repentance, Iustification,</HI> &amp;c. nor to <HI>give a reason of the hope that is in them,</HI> which they are required to do. And the rather that they may with|stand fundamental errors, as well as resist evil practices; which was memorably seen in the very <HI>Children of Merin|dol,</HI> who made a solemn <HI>Confession of their Faith</HI> from Scrip|ture, amazing and confounding their persecuting adver|saries. That shining Star <HI>Luther,</HI> in the dawning of the Reformation, used to say his Catechism was <HI>parva Biblia,</HI> the <HI>little Bible,</HI> meaning a short sum of that heavenly Do|ctrine which the very Son of God did publish from the bosom of his eternal Father, and which the Holy Spirit did reveal by the Prophets and Apostles for the salvation of our souls. This might move <HI>him,</HI> reforming the Church from the dregs of Idolatry and Superstition, to carry his <HI>Catechism</HI> always along with him, to read and peruse it almost every day, as he did; affirming seriously, that he always learned something from it, which he did not (at least so practically) know before. Agreeable whereunto, in our age, said laborious, holy, and zealous Mr. <HI>Ioseph Alleine</HI> concerning Catechism, <HI>If any think themselves above it, 'tis from their pride or ignorance, for my part I account my self a learner.</HI> And therefore a <HI>Sum of Christian Principles,</HI> methodically digested and explain'd, ought to be sought after and embrac'd by us, as a precious treasure, yea for the elder to have recourse to; but more especially for the younger, who almost from their very Cradles may learn something of it as the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.5.</NOTE>, that as new-born Babes they may receive the sincere <HI>milk</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.2. <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1, 2.</NOTE> of the word,
<PB N="V" REF="4">
that they may grow thereby <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sir</HI> Edwyn Sands <HI>observed Eighty years ago, that this was a notable means for the growth of the</HI> Reformed Religion.</NOTE>. Upon this account I ear|nestly intreat you who can justly claim a superiority in your own houses, that you would bethink your selves what an <HI>authority</HI> you are entrusted with from God, who re|quires you to exercise it with an holy zeal, and maintain it with all Christian prudence, without Lordliness and ri|gour, endeavour to be well skill'd in the Scripture <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 17.18, 19.</NOTE>; con|sult the several tempers of those within your doors; allot fit and stated seasons for the getting of these Principles by heart; and watch over them daily with care, both as to their set task, and practice answerable to these Principles; keeping them seriously to mind both the <HI>business</HI> of Reli|gion in their general Calling, and of their distinct worldly employments in their particular Callings. Suffer not your selves and houses to go hurrying to Hell, by opposing Gods most wise government of the world, which he car|ries on orderly for the safety and comfort of his Servants, by well-instructed Families (such as <HI>Abrahams</HI> was) who became instrumental to carry down the knowledg of God in all peaceableness to posterity; so as to leave an expecta|tion of Gods blessing upon them, whose welfare <HI>Nature</HI> it self doth move us to promote. The truth is, <HI>My Friends,</HI> if we did but remember our selves, as we are <HI>Christians,</HI> dedicated to God by <HI>Baptism,</HI> expecting benefit by the pur|chase of Christ, we should consider we are not our own, but bought with a price, under the greatest obligation to live to him that hath bought us; and should take all pos|sible care that we and ours might be <HI>His.</HI> Do then I be|seech you, all you can to save your selves and others. Oh! pity their poor souls defiled by sin, and expos'd to misery. Oh! let them not perish through your carelesness, lest any of them say in Hell, as <HI>Cyprian</HI> brings in Children saying, <HI>their Parents were their Murderers</HI>; 'Tis long of you that we lye in easeless torments. Bewail the corrupted sad estate of your Children, as descending and deriving pollution from you. Let them timely know the only remedy; bring them to reverence the holy God, and read his word with greatest awe; shewing them the danger of breaking his
<PB N="VI" REF="5">
Commandments, the benefit of ordering their lives accor|ding to his mind, that they may truly glorifie and enjoy him. Charge them to take heed they be not carryed away with an inordinate love to the profits, pleasures, and ho|nours of this life; but learn the great lessons of self-denial and cleaving to the Lord Jesus with full purpose of heart, bearing patiently whatever he is pleas'd to try them with. And be sure you neglect not seasonably and duly, to <HI>ad|monish</HI> and <HI>correct</HI> them <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> 29.15, 17. with 4. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.23, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash;3.13. <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.47, 48. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.24, 25, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, that their iniquities be not their ruine. Do <HI>you</HI> who are <HI>Inferiours</HI> willingly submit. Oh! take heed of <HI>refusing instruction,</HI> or opposing the means which is used to bring you acquainted with <HI>God</HI> and your <HI>selves</HI>; lest you be found guilty of shutting out the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, that it may not shine into your hearts.</P>
<P N="2">II. Concerning the <HI>import</HI> and <HI>usefulness</HI> of this <HI>small Book</HI> I do here put into your <HI>hands</HI> and <HI>houses</HI>; praying the <HI>spiri|tual matter</HI> of it may reach to, and abide in your hearts. You see here be under four chief <HI>Heads</HI> or <HI>Chapters</HI> an 107 short <HI>Articles</HI> (which also are <HI>Answers</HI> to the <HI>Questions</HI> in the Margin) now generally received. These <HI>A.'s</HI> are as so many entire Sentences, or distinct Propositions and A|phorisms (the Commandments are Ten of them) with|out depending for their <HI>sense</HI> upon any Question; contain|ing the <HI>fundamentals</HI> of Christian <HI>knowledg</HI> and <HI>practice</HI>; so that the Learner may by committing them to memory, lay up in his heart the Sum of Christianity; and make a pro|fession, confession, or repetition of it when call'd, in a con|tinued speech, or else <HI>answer</HI> to any part of it, particularly when the <HI>Questions</HI> in the Margin are used by another, ma|king enquiry into his knowledg. These several <HI>Articles</HI> you find have plain proofs from <HI>Scripture</HI> at large, to shew that these <HI>necessary</HI> matters of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> are surely founded upon the never-failing word of God; whose su|pream <HI>authority</HI> should be of force to awe our <HI>consciences,</HI> and engage our hearts to the <HI>practise</HI> of those things which do appear to be our indispensable <HI>duties.</HI> Unto <HI>Divine war|rant,</HI> for further illustration and confirmation, here are the <HI>Testimonies</HI> brought from the authentick Records of <HI>Reformed
<PB N="VII" REF="5">
Religion</HI> amongst us, I mean the <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Homilies</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as agreeing with, and clearing or strengthening of the several Propositions; yea and very consonant to the main body of the materials in the <HI>short Catechism</HI> which is in the <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI> to be learn'd by every Child, before he be <HI>confirm'd,</HI> or admitted to re|ceive the <HI>Holy Communion.</HI> For the four chief heads there, are the <HI>Creed,</HI> or things to be <HI>believed</HI>; the <HI>Ten Command|ments,</HI> shewing our duty to God and our Neighbours; the Doctrine of the <HI>Sacraments</HI>; the things contain'd in the <HI>Lords Prayer.</HI> And there they who present Children at <HI>Bap|tism,</HI> are charged to <HI>call upon them to hear Sermons, and chiefly provide that they may learn the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the Ten Commandments in the English tongue, and all other things which a Christian man ought to know and believe to his Souls health.</HI> All which are (as in so short a room can be well expected) methodically presented to you in this Book. Wherein lastly you have our departed Friend's endeavours in a <HI>short and easie Explanation,</HI> to make the Principles plain to be understood. Now for the <HI>use</HI> and <HI>improvement</HI> of it, and the advantage you may have by it (supposing you will first read this Epistle of mine to you), I would ad|vise you who have the charge of Families especially, and can read, or have those in your house or neighbourhood who will do it for you; unless your own prudence dictate somewhat better for any of you in your circumstances: (1) <HI>Distinctly</HI> and <HI>treatably</HI> to read over, the <HI>Articles</HI> or <HI>An|swers,</HI> without taking any notice <HI>then</HI> of the <HI>Questions</HI>; and require those under your charge to attend diligently there|unto. I suppose you may go over (if not all) one half of the <HI>A. s</HI> (which are printed in a large letter) at <HI>one</HI> solemn <HI>reading</HI>; then the <HI>next</HI> time the rest, beginning where you left. But if any of you think the Task too large for <HI>once</HI> or <HI>twice,</HI> divide it into <HI>four</HI> or <HI>three Read|ings.</HI> If according to <HI>Chapters,</HI> you may read each day (that you set apart for this purpose) <HI>one</HI>; if into <HI>three,</HI> according to <HI>Chapters,</HI> or chief heads, for distinction of matter, you may the <HI>first</HI> one day, the <HI>second</HI> another, and the <HI>two last</HI> on the third. If according to <HI>Articles</HI> for <HI>five</HI> days, on the <HI>first</HI> day read Nineteen <HI>Articles,</HI> on the <HI>second</HI> Nineteen more, ending with the Thirty-Eighth Ar|ticle, on the <HI>third</HI> twenty <HI>A. s</HI> more, ending with Article
<PB REF="6">
Sixty-two, on the <HI>fourth</HI> Twenty-two <HI>A. s</HI> more, ending with <HI>A.</HI> Eighty-five, on the <HI>fifth</HI> Twenty-two <HI>A. s</HI> more, to the end. (2) Your next reading of these Principles or Articles over, should be with the Texts of Scripture that prove them, and the <HI>Testimonies</HI> of the Reformed Church of <HI>England,</HI> attesting and in a sort opening, or some way clearing each Proposition. (3) The last reading (if not dispatch'd at once with the second) should be the <HI>Expla|nations</HI> of the <HI>Author,</HI> enlarging more upon each <HI>Article,</HI> and so making it more plain and clear, even to the mean|est understanding, who will be attentive and considerate. To which purpose, those who govern in each Family, should be <HI>always watchful</HI> to see there be an attendance to it without noise. But you should at the beginning, after the first Reading, set in with those under your charge to get the <HI>Articles</HI> or <HI>Answers</HI> without book; (and if by Friends I understand the <HI>poorer</HI> sort will in good earnest learn them by heart, likely I may procure the <HI>A. s</HI> printed in one sheet by themselves to give to them; those who are more able will I suppose buy them). Then you may hear them repeat what they have learned; and proceed those days you <HI>Catechise</HI> them, especially every <HI>Lords-day</HI> (you who have not better helps) to read some portion of the <HI>Explanation,</HI> so much at least as was learn'd the week be|fore, engaging them by small <HI>rewards</HI> and <HI>punishments,</HI> to hearken with all seriousness, and to <HI>do that with all their might</HI> which is evidently prov'd to be their <HI>duty.</HI> This con|scientiously and constantly perform'd, will I hope through <HI>Gods blessing</HI> turn to a good account for <HI>you</HI> and <HI>me.</HI> 'Tis only for the sakes of some I am thus <HI>minute.</HI> Give me leave then particularly to mind those who have not yet exercised themselves to Prayer (as they should have done), how this <HI>Book</HI> may be helpful, and improv'd to a solemn performance of that <HI>duty,</HI> and an attainment of a <HI>gift</HI> therein; by having variety of orderly and <HI>fit matter</HI> upon all occasi|ons, from a distinct knowledg of our sins and wants. As for instance, <HI>A.</HI> 98. you have the <HI>nature</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> described, which you will do well to read, pause upon, and consider how it is prov'd by <HI>Scripture-Testimony,</HI> and how <HI>attested</HI> by our Forefathers; then read our Authors <HI>Explanation</HI> of it, whereby you will come to understand the <HI>parts</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI>; and in whose <HI>name</HI> it is to be offered to God, for which see
<PB N="IX" REF="6">
also <HI>A.</HI> 21, 25. Now for you who are a Learner, to frame your self to <HI>pray</HI> orderly and pertinently, you may look into, and meditate upon <HI>A.</HI> 4. compar'd with <HI>A.</HI> 100, 101. for a <HI>Preface.</HI> Then pass on to <HI>confess</HI> your original sin, by considering (and if you will you may take your Pen and write out particulars prayer-wise) <HI>A.</HI> 14, 15, 16. compared with <HI>A.</HI> 13. Then you may particularize your actual trans|gressions, by considering what is <HI>forbidden</HI> in every <HI>Com|mandment</HI> of the Law, and acknowledging those sins, which by looking into that glass you find your hearts to upbraid you with, <HI>A.</HI> 47, 51, 55, 61, 65, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81. Then you may see their aggravations, <HI>A.</HI> 83, 84. with their Explanati|ons. Then the consequents or punishments due to trans|gressors, <HI>A.</HI> 17, 18, 19. Hereupon consider the <HI>Gospel</HI> requires <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance, A.</HI> 86, 87. Then come to the next part of Prayer, <HI>viz. Petition.</HI> Here you may have directions to pray for the <HI>Spirit,</HI> working in Effectual Calling, <HI>A.</HI> 29, 30, 31. Pleading <HI>Christs</HI> mediation, <HI>A.</HI> 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. and seek|ing particularly, that God would give what he <HI>requires</HI> in his holy <HI>Commandments, A.</HI> 46, 50, 54, 57, 64, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80. compar'd with <HI>A.</HI> 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, and <HI>A.</HI> 33, 34, 35, 36. still collecting and compacting such <HI>materials</HI> out of these <HI>Articles,</HI> and the <HI>Scriptures</HI> proving of them, with what follows (where it is needful) in the <HI>Explanation</HI> more briefly or largely, as every ones present condition and cir|cumstances require. Now for the remaining part of Pray|er, which is <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> you will better know what you are to give thanks for, by seeing what <HI>sins</HI> or <HI>evils</HI> God hath kept you from; and what <HI>good</HI> things he hath bestow'd upon you.

Turn to these <HI>Articles,</HI> as you see them noted here thus minutely for the sake of you (who need such direction) and yours, some of whom possibly you may engage to write what you shew them in this order, or when you read to them, for the teaching of them to be more methodical, in learning to pray, and that longer or shorter, as occasion requires, for their own and others edification. But still remember, <HI>It is the Spirit likewise that helpeth our infirmities, Rom.</HI> 8.26. So that our
<PB N="X" REF="7">
prayers through Christ may be truly acceptable to God, and a means of our sanctification. I do not urge you in every prayer to insist on every head here, or restrain you to these, only shew you a way how to use these; neither would I tye you to this way, but advise you to exercise your spiritual senses to discern, and have regard to your own occasions, and the enlargement of your own hearts, that out of the abundrnce of them, in faith and humility you may express your minds to God in Scripture-language, from a feeling of our own wants. Thus I have took the freedom to suggest something of <HI>help in this kind,</HI> to those who may either desire or need it. But I impose nothing upon any one, which God hath left free. I hope none that know me well, will judg me to be so narrow-spirited. I have only offered a guide to the weaker, for to bring to their mind needful matter, under the three main parts of Prayer, <HI>viz. Confession, Petition, Thanksgiving.</HI> It may be some will begin with <HI>Petition</HI> or <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> and then <HI>Confession,</HI> or vary and use them interchangeably, as in pru|dence they think best for that season, or are moved by the holy Spirit to omit, or but touch on one, or the other part, and slay most on the third, which may do well. The great care to be took, is that the party <HI>praying</HI> perform this ne|cessary duty with <HI>hearty</HI> and <HI>sincere devotion.</HI> But I humbly conceive, it were of great advantage, for one or more se|rious <HI>persons</HI> in a Neighbourhood, who have better under|standing (after the reading this I now write to you) to shew unto those of meaner abilities, the import of this ad|vise for the use and improvement of this small token for their <HI>knowledg</HI> and <HI>practise.</HI> Perhaps the <HI>School-Master</HI> may think it expedient to do it for some of his <HI>Scholars</HI> in the highest Form. However I could perswade my self some <HI>unexperienc'd</HI> in praying (especially towardly young ones) will rejoice to be directed. I have latele known some who have been much changed and wrought upon by the serious reading of such a Book as this, given and heartily recom|mended to them. It would do well in your <HI>Family-read|ing</HI> of it, if some of the House would turn to the <HI>Bible,</HI> and find out the <HI>Texts,</HI> that you may with your own eyes see them <HI>there</HI> as cited. I doubt not but you will find them, unless possibly by the error of the <HI>Printer</HI> (which yet I know not) there may be somewhere a failure; but
<PB N="XI" REF="7">
then you having the <HI>words,</HI> a little searching of the Scrip|ture will soon amend that (if it should be so). But I fear in being thus particular for your <HI>profit</HI> (which I aim at) I shall run my self beyond my projected <HI>bounds.</HI> It remains I should subjoin something of,</P>

<P><HI>Homil.</HI> 3. <HI>Of Salvation.</HI>&mdash;Above all things, and in all things to advance the glory of God, of whom only we have our sanctification, justification, salvation, and redemption.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="14"><HI>Expl.</HI> 1. In which <HI>A.</HI> there are these four things to be explain'd: (1.) What we are to under|stand by a <HI>mans end.</HI> And the Answer is, That by a <HI>mans end</HI> we mean that which a man doth intend or aim at in all his actions; or that which he does propose to himself as the reason of what he does; <HI>ex. gr.</HI> when you see a man bu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">lding a House, if you ask him the reason why he builds a House, or what he intends in so doing; his answer will be, to dwell in it: And here, his dwelling in his House, when he hath built it, is his <HI>end</HI> in building his House. So again, when you see a man going to Church, if you ask him what he goes to Church for; he'll pre|sently tell you, to hear a Sermon: Now this being that which he does design in going to Church, <HI>sc.</HI> to hear a Sermon, it may very well be called his <HI>end</HI> in going to Church. But then 2<HI>dly,</HI> It is next to be explained, what is meant by a mans <HI>chief end</HI>: Now a mans <HI>chief end,</HI> is that which he doth prin|cipally aim at in all his actions. As to keep to the last instance, though it be a mans <HI>end</HI> (in going to Church) to hear a Sermon; yet that is but a <HI>lower end,</HI> and that which he does only design in order to his <HI>chief end,</HI> which is to glorifie God, and to enjoy Communion with God, by hearing his word: This Questi|on therefore (<HI>What is the chief end of man?</HI>) is <HI>(q. d.)</HI> what is mans chief errand into the world? or what did God make man for? or
<PB N="3" REF="14">
what is the great business that should take up the greatest part of a mans time, thoughts, cares, affections, and endeavours, whilst he lives in the world? or what is it that a man is principally to drive at in all his words, thoughts, and actions, in all his duties both to God and man, and in all his dealings with the world? Now this is that which should be his general drift in all, <HI>sc.</HI> To glorifie God, and to enjoy God both in this world and a better. And this is the plain meaning of those Scriptures which are here made use of as proofs. But (alas) is it not sadly to be lamented, that the corrupt generality of people, have quite forgotten what errand they were sent about into the world; whilst some make worldly ho|nours and preferments their <HI>chief end,</HI> as the ambitious; others make worldly gain and pro|fit their <HI>chief end,</HI> and that which they mainly drive at, as the covetous; and others do make their carnal pleasures, delights, sports, and pastimes their <HI>chief end,</HI> as if God had put them into the world, as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> reports of the <HI>Leviathans</HI> being put into water, to play therein: and this is the case of the younger sort generally of vain and wicked people, who either do not know, or will not consider, that the end of their Creation was to honour and enjoy their Creator, both here and hereafter. 3<HI>dly,</HI> What it is to <HI>glorifie God,</HI> may be thus ex|plained; namely, it is to live according to his will revealed in his word; or, it is to think,
<PB N="4" REF="15">
speak, and do according to the <HI>Rule</HI> of his word. (1.) We <HI>glorifie God</HI> in our thoughts, or in our hearts, when we dare not allow our selves to think any thing that is not stampt with Gods authority and allowance; and more particularly, when our thoughts of God, of his works, words, and all that relates to him, are such as do become his excellent Greatness. So when we fear, love, admire, trust, and de|sire him above all. (2.) We <HI>glorifie him</HI> in our words, when our speech is not cor|rupt, vain, and idle, but seasoned with grace. (3.) In our actions, when we make his word our rule, and his glory our great and general <HI>end</HI> in all our actions. 4<HI>thly,</HI> What it is to <HI>enjoy God</HI>; we may best con|ceive of it, by what it is to enjoy a friend: Now this is, we know, to have his presence, com|pany, and converse, and to take delight in his society. So to <HI>enjoy God,</HI> it is to converse with God, to be well-pleased with his gracious presence, and not only to have him to be our Friend, or Father, but to entertain this King of glory in our hearts and affections. Or as wicked men do look upon the greatest part of their enjoyment to consist in (that which they miscall) good-fellowship; so the Christi|ans <HI>enjoying of God,</HI> is to have fellowship with him: <HI>Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Iesus Christ.</HI> And to main|tain and keep up this fellowship with God for ever, it is to <HI>enjoy him for ever</HI>; which in re|ference
<PB N="5" REF="15">
to a Christians enjoyment of God in glory, is called a being <HI>for ever with the Lord,</HI> 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.17.</P>
<P><HI>A</HI> 2.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What Rule hath God given to di|rect us how we may glorifie and enjoy him?</HI></NOTE> The Word of God (which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph. 2.20. <HI>And are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone.</HI></NOTE>), is the only Rule to direct us how we may glo|rifie <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 3.16. <HI>All Scripture is given by inspirati|on of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correcti|on, for instruction in righteousness.</HI></NOTE>, and enjoy him <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 1.3. <HI>That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Iesus Christ.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Artic.</HI> vi. In the name of the Holy Scripture we do un|derstand those Canonical Books of the Old and New Testa|ment, of whose Authority was never any doubt in the Church. <HI>Homil.</HI> 1. Unto a Christian man there can be no|thing either more necessary or profitable, than the know|ledg of holy Scripture; for as much as in it is contained Gods true Word, setting forth his glory, and also mans duty. &mdash; As many as be desirous to enter into the right and perfect way unto God, must apply their minds to know holy Scripture, without the which they can nei|ther sufficiently know God and his Will, neither their office and duty. &mdash;Let us willingly search for the well of life in the Books of the Old and New Testament, and not run to the stinking Puddles of mens Traditions, (devised by mens imagination) for our justification and salva|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="16"><HI>Expl.</HI> 2. When the written <HI>Word of God</HI> is here cal|led a <HI>Rule,</HI> we may understand it thus; That as an <HI>Artificer,</HI> suppose a Mason or Bricklayer, in raising a Wall, or a Carpenter in squaring a piece of Timber, makes use of his Rule, and by apply|ing this to his work, comes to know whether it be streight or crooked: So the Christian, who would order his spiritual Building or Con|versation aright, so as to glorifie and enjoy God, he must lay every stone in this spiritual Building by this <HI>Rule</HI>; he must square all his thoughts, words, and actions by this <HI>Line</HI> and <HI>Level,</HI> and thereby he may come to know what is right and what is wrong, what is sin and what is duty, what is true and what is false; and so accordingly may <HI>cease to do evil,</HI> and <HI>learn to do well</HI>; believe that which is <HI>true,</HI> and reject that which is <HI>false</HI>; nor is the Old Testa|ment alone this <HI>Rule,</HI> nor the new Testament alone, but <HI>both together</HI>; and both together they are the <HI>only Rule</HI> of Christianity; neither is there any other ordinary, sufficient Rule to direct a Christian, either how he may serve God acceptably, or enjoy God eternally, but this written Word. (1.) The <HI>Pagans Rule,</HI> or <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> or what may be known of God by the things which are made, is not sufficient to this end, because it cannot disco|ver Christ to us, which is the only means of salvation. (2.) The <HI>Papists Rule</HI> of <HI>Tradition</HI> is no good Rule, because fallible and contra|dictory in many things to the Rule of Scrip|ture.
<PB N="7" REF="16">
And (3.) for the very same reason, the <HI>Quakers Rule</HI> is no good Rule, I mean their <HI>Light within,</HI> because opposite to the light of the Word without; and therefore it remaineth that the written Word is the only Rule.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 3.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What do the Scrip|tures principally teach?</HI></NOTE> The Scriptures prin|cipally teach, what man is to <HI>believe</HI> concerning God, and what <HI>duty</HI> God requireth of man <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 1.13. <HI>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Iesus.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Artic.</HI> vi. Holy Scripture contains all things necessary to salvation; so that whatever is not read therein, or prov'd thereby, is not to be required of any man that it should be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought necessary or requisite to salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Homil.</HI> 1. In holy Scripture is fully contained what we ought to do, and what to eschew; what to believe, what to love, and what to look for at Gods hand at length.</P>
<P><HI>Expl.</HI> 3. There are two things principally which man is to believe concerning God, and they are the two main <HI>foundations</HI> of the Christian Re|ligion, in the practice of it: (1.) That <HI>God is,</HI> or that there is such a being who is in and of himself absolutely perfect, and who gives Being to all his Creatures. (2.) That he is <HI>a rewarder of those that diligently seek him,</HI> namely, in and through Christ, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6. or that it is not in vain to love, serve, and obey this God. And there is but one thing,
<PB N="8" REF="17">
in the general, which God requires of man, namely, a free and full compliance with his will, whether in the doing or suffering part of Religion.</P>

the <HI>first,</HI> we are to know, that by a <HI>person</HI> in the general we mean a substantial compleat Being (whether visible or invisible), having understanding, will, and subsistence by it self, and distinguished from any thing else by some peculiar property that belongs to it, and to nothing else besides it self; as there is some|thing peculiar in every one man to distinguish him from another; this for a <HI>person</HI> in gene|ral: But now for a <HI>Divine person,</HI> (or a per|son in the Godhead), 'Tis a substance that is undivided, and absolutely perfect in Being, Understanding, Will, and manner of Sub|sistence; yet actually, really, and eternally di|stinguished from any other person, by some relative property that belongs to it, and not to that person. (2.) For the <HI>number</HI> of the persons in the Godhead, they are three; not only in the reckoning of man, or according to humane apprehension, but also in reality, and in Gods account; whether men should reckon them so or no, and are therefore called a <HI>Tri|nity of Persons.</HI> Yet (3.) though they be so <HI>distinguished</HI> one from another, as that the Fa|ther is not the Son, and the Son not the Fa|ther, and the Holy Ghost neither Father nor Son; yet they are not, cannot be divided or separated one from another, because the whole and single Godhead is wholly, coequally, and coessentially in all three, by virtue whereof 'tis said, these <HI>three</HI> are <HI>one, (i. e.)</HI> one God.</P>

the government of it as the Pilot. Other <HI>distinctions</HI> there are of Providence; as, (2.)

The <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> was made with man <HI>before</HI> the Fall, before he had sinned a|gainst God; the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> afterward. (2.) The <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> did not promise pardon upon <HI>repentance</HI>; the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> does, because Christ the Mediator of this Cove|nant has purchased pardon for all penitent sin|ners, who have but a hand of <HI>Faith</HI> to receive it. (3.) The <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> was <HI>without</HI> a
<PB N="24" REF="25">
<HI>Mediator,</HI> for till man had sinned he needed none to mediate peace betwixt God and him; but the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> is established in the hands of a <HI>Mediator, sc.</HI> Christ Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, that he might make a reconciliation betwixt God and Man. (4.) In the <HI>Covenant of Nature</HI> (or <HI>Works</HI>) <HI>Adam</HI> was only the Son of God by Creation; but in the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> those who were chil|dren of wrath, do through Faith become the Children of God by Grace and <HI>Adoption.</HI> (5.) The <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> had for its <HI>Seals</HI> of confirmation, or for the Sacraments of it, the <HI>Tree of life,</HI> so called because it did sacramen|tally confirm the promise of life upon condi|tion of perfect obedience; and the <HI>Tree of knowledg of good and evil,</HI> which was so called from the event, because man having sinned in eating the forbidden fruit, he presently came to know by a sad experiment, what an infi|nite good he had lost in losing Gods favour, and what misery and mischief he had brought upon himself. But now the <HI>Seals</HI> or <HI>Sacra|ments</HI> of the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> were under the Old Testament <HI>Circumcision</HI> and the <HI>Pas|chal Lamb,</HI> and now under the New Testament, <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lords Supper.</HI> (6.) In the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> there was no place at all for Gods further exercising of his patience, grace and mercy; but in the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> his <HI>mercy</HI> most is signally display'd; yea and that which is a mystery as well as a miracle of Di|vine

<P><HI>Expl.</HI> 18. There are four Particulars in this <HI>A.</HI> (which do all suppose that <HI>Adam</HI> sin'd as a common Representative of all Mankind.) As, (1.) That the guilt of that single act of disobe|dience which <HI>Adam</HI> was guilty of, is very justly imputed to all the degenerate and sinful race of <HI>Adam</HI>; for that Covenant which was made with him being made with us also in him, when he transgressed by eating the forbidden fruit, we his posterity are to be looked upon as <HI>Accessa|ries,</HI> and consenting to the fact; and when he thus sinned, it was as much as if <HI>all</HI> his posterity had sinned in their own persons. (2) The <HI>want</HI> of <HI>original righteousness,</HI> or the want of power and ability to do the will of God which man had by Creation; for God made man up|right,

that is, in a capacity and with ability to do the whole will of God; which ability was not taken away from man till he had foolishly and wilfully thrown it away. (3.)

For every one of us may truly say with <HI>David,</HI> one by one, <HI>Behold I was sha|pen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother con|ceive me</HI>: It being impossible that a clean thing should come out of an unclean. Now because this corruption of nature is the fountain of all manner of sin, both in thought, word, and deed, therefore it is called <HI>original</HI> sin. And then, (4.) All those <HI>corrupt streams</HI> which do proceed from this corrupt fountain, are called <HI>actual</HI> sins; by which I understand any action of a man, whether it be an <HI>internal</HI> action of the mind and soul; or <HI>external,</HI> of the body, which is not conformable to the Law of God; as also the neglect and omission of any action (whether internal or external) which the Law requires.</P>

Of Gods sweet and gracious presence and com|pany, and that in a most immediate manner, as one friend is personally present with another. (2.) Of converse with God; for whilst God and man were together in Paradise, and man continued innocent, their society was not like that of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in their Silent-Meetings, but there would have continued such familiari|ty betwixt them, as is betwixt two loving friends, they would have walked together, and

talked together; for if God did use that fami|liarity with <HI>Moses, Exod.</HI> 33.11. since the fall, much more would he have continued it with <HI>Adam</HI> and his posterity, if they had never fal'n. (3.) From this sweet company and converse would have sprung up in the heart, a conti|nual satisfaction and delight to the soul of man; for man yet continuing like God, he could not but love him, and delight himself in this sweet intercourse. (2<HI>dly,</HI>) The <HI>sinful posterity</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI> (till interested in Christ) are actually under the wrath of God, for God is angry with the wicked every day; and actu|ally under the curse, because under the Law, not under Grace.

<PB N="37" REF="31">
of these <HI>two</HI> things in Gods decree of Election, (1.) Gods most <HI>wise</HI> design, to ad|vance the glory of his free-grace, in bringing many sons to glory. (2.) That God of his <HI>free grace</HI> had singled and culled out a certain distinct number of persons for the enjoy|ment of this glory. Now this very act of Gods picking and culling out those particu|lar persons whom he designed to save, is that we call very properly <HI>Election.</HI> Neither did this grace of God only appear in making this choice, and then in leaving his chosen ones to get eter|nal life and heaven as they could; but (2<HI>dly,</HI>) He did also pitch upon an <HI>effectual means,</HI> or contrive a way whereby his chosen people should effectually and infallibly obtain eternal life; and this was by entring into a Covenant of Grace, with Christ the <HI>second Adam,</HI> and the Mediator of the new Covenant; and in Christ with all believers, that <HI>whosoever should believe on the Son of God, he would give unto them eternal life</HI>; and that they should never enter into condemnation.

<HI>Adam</HI>; but by <HI>eternal</HI> generation, so as that God the Father, who begat him, was not be|fore him in time: And he was God, that his Godhead might keep his humane nature from sinking under infinite wrath when he suffered for our sins, that he might have power to raise himself from the grave, and rescue himself out of the jaws of death, that the dignity of his person might render his sufferings, obedi|ence, intercession, and satisfaction of <HI>infinite</HI> value and efficacy, for the procuring of eternal life for his people, and that he might be in a capacity to bestow his Spirit upon them, and to conquer all their enemies for them. (2.) He must be Man as well as God, that he might perform obedience, suffer, satisfie, and inter|cede for us in our nature; that he might be a merciful High-Priest, and have a fellow-feel|ing of our infirmities. (3.) Both God and Man in one person, that he might be a fit Me|diator betwixt God and man, to make up the difference betwixt them, which sin had made. For as sin is the only make-bate, so Christ ha|ving taken our nature into union with the Godhead, is the only person that is in a capa|city to make peace betwixt an offended God and offending man; and that he might per|form (in the great work of Redemption) whatever was requirable of both natures joint|ly in <HI>one</HI> person; or whatever he was to do as head of the Church.</P>

This arrogancy God detested, that man should so advance his Laws to make them equal with Gods Laws, wherein the true honour|ing and right worshipping of God standeth, to make his Laws for them to be left off.

<HEAD>Rules to be observed for the understanding of the Moral Law, or the Ten Command|ments.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1 <HI>Rule,</HI> That Christ the Lawgiver is the best In|terpreter of <HI>Moses</HI>; or that the Gospel is the fullest and clearest Interpreter of the Law. The Writings of the Prophets are many times good Expositions of the Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> But the Writings of Christ and his Apostles are far more clear and full. In reference to Christ we have a known instance in the 5<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Mat. passim.</HI> And the Apostles frequently in their Epistles, as when we are commanded to shun all occasions of evil, to love the Lord Jesus in sincerity, and our neighbour without dissi|mulation, and not to defraud him any way, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="80" REF="53">2 <HI>Rule,</HI> That the Law is perfect, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.7. as (1.) In it self, not admitting of any additio|nal Precepts in the Gospel, which are gene|rally obliging to all Christians which were not obliging before that Christ came in the flesh. For as for those three Precepts of the Gospel, for a man, (1.) To deny himself. (2.) To take up his Cross; and (3.) To fol|low Christ; they are rather interpretations and instances of that honour and love we are to have for Christ as God, which is required in the First Command, than any additions ob|liging, which did not oblige before; nay <HI>Da|vid</HI> himself did in some respect deny himself, take up his Cross, and follow Christ; the middle of these had place when he said, <HI>The reproaches of those who reproached thee are faln upon me</HI>; and so <HI>Moses</HI> deny'd himself, and <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Ioshuah</HI> followed the Lord fully. (2.) The Law is perfect in its extent and comprehension, in regard of the subject, for it doth command the whole Soul in all its powers and faculties; for it doth require the understanding to know, the judgment to ap|prove that which is good; the will to chuse it, the memory to retain it, and the affecti|ons to pursue and enjoy it; and upon this account it is said, that the Law is spiritual.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 <HI>Rule,</HI> Whatever the Law commands, it doth forbid the contrary; as when it commands us to honour our Parents, it doth forbid us to dishonour them; and whatever the Law
<PB N="81" REF="53">
forbids it commands the contrary; as when it forbids us to take the name of God in vain, it requires us to use any of the names, or titles, or ordinances of God with reverence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 <HI>Rule,</HI> When the Law commandeth a duty, (as suppose to worship God) it doth require us to make use of means, occasions, motives and encouragements to it: and when the Law forbids (<HI>ex. gr.</HI> worshipping of Images), it doth also forbid the occasions, appearances and inducements of any evil.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5 <HI>Rule,</HI> Where a promise is annexed (<HI>ex. gr.</HI> that the days may be long in the Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) there the contrary threatning is included; and where a threatning is annexed, there the con|trary promise is included.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6 <HI>Rule,</HI> That the duties of the second table must give place to the indispensable and neces|sary duties of the first table, when they cannot both be performed together, as the love of Parents must yield to the love of God; but in things ceremonial, the duties of the first table must yield to the moral duties of the second; as sacrificing to works of mercy towards man.</ITEM>

<P><HI>To.</HI> 2. <HI>Hom.</HI> I. The Scriptures use the two words (Idols and Images) indifferently for one thing alway. They be words of divers things (<HI>Gr. &amp; Lat.</HI>), but one in sense and signification in the Scriptures, and matters of of Religion. &mdash; Wherefore our Images, if publickly suffer'd in Temples and Churches, be indeed none other but Idols, as unto which Idolatry hath been, is, and ever will be committed.&mdash;Hath it not been preach'd unto
<PB N="87" REF="56">
you since the beginning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How by the Creation of the World, and the greatness of the work, they might understand the Majesty of God, the Creator and Maker of all, to be greater than that it should be express'd or set forth in any Image or bodily Similitude. And that in the First Table, and the beginning thereof,&mdash;is this Doctrine aforesaid (not briefly touch'd, but) at large set forth, and that with denunciation of destruction to the contemners and breakers of this Law, and their posterity after them.</P>
<P><HI>Expl.</HI> 49. We have here principally observable, (1.) The <HI>order</HI>; (2.) The <HI>matter</HI> of the Com|mandment. From the <HI>order,</HI> we are to ob|serve, that God doth prefer the inward wor|ship of the heart, which is required in the first Command, to the outward worship of the body, which is here principally directed, that the later, or that of the body, without the former is but <HI>hypocritical</HI>; and the former without the later but <HI>partial</HI>; so that God is to be worshipp'd with all our bodies and spi|rits. Those therefore who do present their bodies in Idol-worship (as that of the Mass) and yet plead they keep their hearts for God, are here condemned. (2.) The <HI>matter,</HI> or argument and scope of the Command, <HI>i. e.</HI> to prevent all miscarriages and abuses in bodily worship, and to instruct men how they may present their bodies as well as their souls a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God. Yet to prevent mistakes about what is forbid|den in this Command, we are to note these two things. (1.) That not <HI>all making</HI> of
<PB N="88" REF="57">
Images or Pictures, or likenesses of the crea|tures is here forbidden; for then it would fol|low, that a man might not so much as frame an Idea in his own fancy of one mans being like another, contrary to the very notion of truth, which is nothing else but a conformity betwixt the mind and the object. (2.) Nor is <HI>all civil</HI> use, or historical representations of things to the eye (which is so helpful to the understanding and memory) here forbidden.</P>

In the general, is here required that the bodily worshipping of God be performed only in such a <HI>manner,</HI> both for substance and circumstances, as God doth require or allow, or at least is not expresly and consequentially contradicted in his word.

It doth require our utmost and constant care and endeavour, to observe and preserve all <HI>holy Ordinances,</HI> and external Church-privi|ledges in their purity and freedom from all manner of corrupt mixtures in any kind, whereby God is provoked; fasting, prayer, thanksgiving, hearing, reading the Word, sing|ing of Psalms, administration and participa|tion of Gospel-Institutions, as the Sacraments, Swearing, the Discipline and Censures of the Church, Maintenance of Gospel Ministers, &amp;c.

Lest the Doctrine against Images should not be marked or remarked, the same is written and required not in one but in sundry places of the word of God,&mdash;Neither could the notableness of the place, being the very beginning of the very loving Lords Law, make us to mark it.&mdash;So that if either the mul|titude or plainness of the places might make us to un|derstand, or the earnest charge that God giveth in these places move us to regard; or the horrible plagues, pu|nishment, and dreadful destruction, threatned to such worshippers of Images or Idols, setters up or maintainers of them, might ingender any fear in our hearts, we would once leave and forsake this wickedness, being in the Lords light so great an offence and abomination. &mdash;p. 3. Images and Image-worshipping were in the primitive Church (which was most pure and incorrupt) abhorr'd and detested as abominable, and contrary to true Christian Religion.&mdash;p. 3. Idolatry cannot be se|parated from Images any long time, but as an unsepa|rable accident, or as a shadow follows the body when the Sun shineth, so Idolatry followeth and cleaveth to the publick having of Images in Temples and Churches. &mdash;It is not possible to keep men from Idolatry, if I|mages

And in this threatning, we have (1.) The <HI>hainousness</HI> of the Sin forbidden; for 'tis here intimated <HI>spiritual</HI> Whoredom, because God is here re|presented as jealous over his people that are entered into a marriage-Covenant with him; under the notion of a Husband that is inraged with jealousie in reference to the unchast beha|viour of his Wife.

<P><HI>Expl.</HI> 53. The infinitely wise God very well knowing that if any seem to be Religious and bridleth not his <HI>tongue,</HI> that man's <HI>Religion is vain</HI>; he doth therefore in this command lay a restraint upon man's tongue, that it may not

(3) From Gods <HI>ex|ample</HI> in resting the seventh day; not that we are therefore to rest on the seventh day in <HI>or|der,</HI> because God did so after he had created the world and all things therein; but that we are to spend (according to the tenour of this

Willingness to hear well, and unwillingness to hear ill of him. (5.) A hearty rejoicing at good, and sorrowing for evil reports of him. (2<HI>dly,</HI>) <HI>Out|wardly,</HI> is required, (1) Silence concerning our neighbour, or the not revealing of se|crets,
<PB N="128" REF="77">
when either his <HI>good name,</HI> or a mans own <HI>good conscience</HI> is in danger to be preju|diced thereby; for to reveal a secret (where the concealing of it is not either much to the damage of others, or of the party who would have it kept a secret) would be a violation both of Christian fidelity, and of humane so|ciety, and of the laws of friendship. (2.) Here is outwardly required our <HI>just defence</HI> of our neighbour, by speaking well of him, (1) so far as the truth of the matter will bear it. (2) As we have a fit opportunity. And (3) a due call to speak on his behalf, but especially in <HI>wit|ness bearing</HI> before a Magistrate; for in such a case a man is to say the whole truth, or all that is material (even in circumstances themselves) for the just vindication of his neighbours good name; and nothing but the truth, not that which is partly true and partly false. (2.) To <HI>do</HI> (as well as <HI>speak</HI>) what we can according to our place and capacity, and to use our ut|most interest for his defence, though there might be something of pains, charge, or haz|zard in such Christian and neighbourly endea|vours. (3.) That a man do <HI>discourage</HI> and <HI>rebuke tale-bearers,</HI> flatterers, slanderers, and false accusers, especially when we observe that what they say is from malice, prejudice, and bitterness, and hath very little of probability in the matter.</P>

(2) <HI>Faith in Iesus Christ</HI>; which was prescribed immediately after the Fall, for the recovery of the favour of God which he had lost; for we are to look upon God not only as the party offended by transgression, but also as the <HI>supreme Lawgiver,</HI> and great Go|vernour of the world; and therefore God as the supreme Governour was bound (by vertue of the perfection of his own Go|vernment, and for the preservation of the honour of his Law and Justice) not to treat with man, in order to his being received into favour again, but only in and through a Mediatour; and because infinite wisdom
<PB N="142" REF="84">
could not find out a fitter than he who was God-man, God was therefore pleased in the riches of his grace and mercy, to pitch upon this way of recovering lost man, <HI>sc.</HI> by <HI>faith in Christ,</HI> who is mediator between God and man: And although the <HI>Law of works</HI> did not accept of repentance upon the breach thereof, yet the <HI>Law of faith</HI> doth, or the Covenant of Grace doth as well re|quire repentance toward God, as faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.

of Christs Ordinances.

it is a part of Sanctification, and not a com|mon work of the spirit which is reckon'd up amongst those things which do not accompany Salvation, as every part of Sanctification doth.

(2) <HI>Hatred</HI> of sin whereby a man doth disrellish, and dislike sin, and can roul it as a sweet mor|sel under his tongue no longer; when he does not only not love sin, but he abhors it, the very thoughts of it are grievous and ungrate|ful to him; and therefore (3) he <HI>turns</HI> from it,

(2) We have here the <HI>description</HI> of Baptism, and therein the <HI>difference</HI> of Baptism from the Lord's Supper. (1) In the <HI>outward</HI> signs or elements in <HI>that</HI> water in <HI>this</HI> Bread and Wine, and God having been so particular and distinct in appointing

these, we should be as strict and careful in the use of them; not <HI>adding</HI> to them the corrupt inventions of men, as the <HI>Papists</HI> do add to Water, Cream, Salt, Oyl and Spittle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor <HI>diminishing</HI> from the other, As they do when they deprive the people of the Cup. (2) They <HI>differ</HI> in their <HI>order,</HI> for Baptism is the <HI>first</HI> Sacrament of the Gospel, because it is to be administred when a Christian (or the Infant of one or both believing Parents) is solemnly to be admitted a member of Christ's visible Church, but the Lord's Supper is to follow this. (3) In <HI>frequency,</HI> Baptism is to be administred but <HI>once,</HI> because a man can be born but once spiritually (as well as naturally) and this Sacrament is a seal of this spiritual birth, when the inward Baptism of the Holy Ghost, is accompanied with the outward of Water, which by the way being both inward and outward, may be called the Doctrine of Baptisms; but the Supper being to represent and exhibit Christ as spiritual nourishment to the soul, may and must be <HI>often,</HI> because we often stand in need of it. (4) In the <HI>form</HI> of administration, Baptism being in the Name of <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost</HI>; because we are to be baptized into all the three persons in the Godhead; but the Supper in these words, <HI>take, eat, this is my body,</HI> &amp;c. (5) In Baptism is sealed to us and represented our <HI>dying</HI> unto sin, and <HI>living</HI> unto righteousness (especially in those of years-that are baptized) but in the

other Sacrament, <HI>Christ dying</HI> for our sin is represented and confirmed to us. (6) Bap|tism doth <HI>seal</HI> us a <HI>title</HI> to all visible Church priviledges and ordinances of the Gospel, and the Lord's Supper doth <HI>suppose</HI> this title both to these and all the benefits and advantages of the Covenant of Grace. (7) In Baptism we solemnly <HI>engage</HI> to be the <HI>Lords,</HI> and to be en|tirely his; and in the Supper we renew this <HI>engagement,</HI> and not only our renewal of our vow, but our Baptismal vow should be fre|quently and seriously considered, especially in a time of Temptation and Apostacy.</P>

rags and nastiness; yet more <HI>distinctly</HI> he must examine himself, (1<HI>st,</HI>) in point of <HI>knowledg,</HI> whether or no he be competently acquainted with the terms of the Covenant of Grace, of which this Sacrament is a seal, and with the ne|cessary principles of Religion, and with the in|dispensable duties of the Gospel&punc; and with the greatness of the love of Christ in dying for sinners; for he who is grosly ignorant of these things, as also of the difference between the Sacramental elements, and actions, and what is spiritually intended by them, can never be able to <HI>discern</HI> the Lord's body; but above all he must be sure to know practically and ex|perimentally Christ crucified in this Sacra|ment.

pious and devout desires though these should never be framed into words; <HI>Internal</HI> or heart-Prayer in some cases is all that God requires, and therefore he will graciously accept of it: But this spiritual Sacrifice must be presented <HI>only</HI> to God; for (1) He <HI>only</HI> knows, and can supply our wants. (2) Faith and Prayer must go together, and faith is <HI>only</HI> to be in God. (3) The Lords Prayer doth <HI>only</HI> send us to God and no other.

<P><HI>Expl.</HI> 99. (2<HI>dly,</HI>) 'Tis essentially necessary to Prayer that it be <HI>only</HI> for things agreeable to <HI>Gods</HI> will. (1) The whole Will of God in <HI>general</HI>; As men must not make their <HI>lust their end,</HI> in begging any thing of God (for those

who ask that they may consume what they ask upon their lust, do ask amiss for the end;) so neither their <HI>fancy</HI> their <HI>rule,</HI> for then they ask amiss for the <HI>manner</HI> and <HI>matter</HI> both.

What is done by his authority, is in his Name. (2) Making use of him as our <HI>Mediator</HI> or Intercessor, or great Master of Requests in Heaven; for we are strangers to God and enemies to him naturally, and so must make use of the Name of Christ, and not of our own. (2<HI>dly.</HI>) The ordinary <HI>kinds</HI> or <HI>parts</HI> of Prayer, are (1) <HI>Confession</HI> of sin, either ex|pressed or implyed, for when we beg or <HI>petition</HI> for any mercy, we are to own our unworthiness of it, which we cannot well do without confes|sion of sin. (2) <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> for there is some|thing of the nature of Prayer in such acknow|ledgments, <HI>scit.</HI> our desire that God would accept of our Sacrifices of Praise, and Christ has taught us in our Prayer to praise God, <HI>For thine is the Kingdom,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

In which words we do pray in the general, that all the Attributes, Titles, Ordinances, Words, and

Works of God (whereby he is made known) may be heartily and highly valued, and esteem|ed, and magnified in the world. More par|ticularly, we beg.

(3) That to this end and purpose God would bestow his <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> upon his people, as the Spi|rit of Truth to lead them into all necessary truth, as a Spirit of Holiness to sanctifie them, and as he is the comforter.

<PB N="181" REF="103">
it must be according to the <HI>pattern</HI> in the Mount, <HI>sc. as it is done in heaven.</HI> For the <HI>matter,</HI> 'tis only <HI>Gods Will</HI> which must be the Rule of mans duty; not the wills, or fancies, or traditions, or corrupt customs of men; we owe obedience no further to men in what they require from us, than it is agreeable to the Will of God, and especially in the duties of Religion, because God alone, who is the sear|cher of the heart, is Lord of the conscience, when-ever therefore what is required of us as matter of duty comes accompany'd with a <HI>thus saith the Lord,</HI> either in the plain words, or in the plain sense of Scripture, we must not dispute, but obey. Yet to prevent mistake, we are to know, (1) There is the <HI>secret will</HI> of God, called the <HI>will</HI> of his <HI>coun|sel</HI> and <HI>purpose</HI>; but though this be the Rule he himself walks by, yet 'tis not the Rule of our obedience, and we are no further to pray that this <HI>will</HI> may be done, than as it seems good to his infinite wisdom; and that we may with patience submit to it, and in all events (though they may cross our wills never so much) acknowledg the holiness and recti|tude of it, and nothing may displease us that pleaseth him. But (2<HI>dly,</HI>) there is his <HI>reveal|ed will,</HI> as (1) in his <HI>promises,</HI> and here we are to pray, that they may be fulfilled.

<P><HI>Expl.</HI> 105. In reference to the petition about <HI>forgiveness,</HI> there is (1) something <HI>imply'd.</HI> (2) The <HI>matter</HI> of the Petition, and (3) the <HI>il|lustration</HI> of it. 'Tis <HI>imply'd,</HI> (1) That man is naturally a <HI>guilty</HI> creature, and under the condemnation, and consequently obnoxious to the curse of the Law, both by reason of Original and Actual sin. (2) That of him|self he <HI>cannot</HI> make <HI>satisfaction</HI> to Divine Ju|stice, nor any other for him (Christ only excepted, who is God as well as man). For if man, or any other creature for him, could satisfie Gods justice, he might then stick to
<PB N="185" REF="105">
that plea, and stand at the bar of Justice; whereas he is now forc'd to the throne of Grace. (3) That God <HI>only</HI> can forgive sin, for man is here directed only to God. (4) That confession of sin, and petition unto God for pardon, is the <HI>way</HI> to obtain this pardon in and through Christ. (2<HI>dly,</HI>) The <HI>matter</HI> of the petition, or that we pray for, 'tis directly and expresly <HI>remission</HI> (or forgive|ness) of sins, and then consequently the im|putation of Christs righteousness to us, by virtue whereof we may find acceptance with God the Father, in and by and through the merit of the righteousness of his Son Christ. For as by <HI>bread</HI> in the former Petition we do by a <HI>Synecdoche</HI> understand all the necessaries of this corporal life; so in this <HI>Petition,</HI> by <HI>forgiveness</HI> we may understand that which is so necessary to eternal life, Christs <HI>righteousness</HI> to be imputed to us; or in one word, in this Petition we beg justification of our persons, as in the next we beg sanctification of our na|tures, hearts, and lives. In short, sith there is <HI>forgiveness with God that he may be feared,</HI> we who are so many condemned Malefactors must make our application and our supplicati|on to him, and to him alone for pardon; for sin is such a burden, and of such intolerable weight, that 'tis only omnipotent mercy that can remove the guilt of it from the consci|ences of men, it being an opposition to the holiness of Gods nature, who is infinite; as
<PB N="186" REF="106">
well as a violation of that Law which is ex|ceeding broad; and therefore, by the way, sin may very well pass for the greatest of evils, sith (1) only the <HI>righteousness</HI> of Christ is broad enough to cover it, that the shame of the sinners nakedness may not appear; (2) only the <HI>mercy</HI> of an infinite God could pardon it; (3) sith 'tis a down-right defacing of the <HI>image</HI> of God in man, and instead thereof drawing the black lines or image of Satan up|on mans soul; (4) and is consequently the greatest <HI>enemy</HI> to mans happiness and per|fection; (5) It doth procure for the impeni|tent unpardoned sinner, the <HI>eternal</HI> wrath of God and flames of hell. <HI>Q.</HI> But it may be here demanded, <HI>why our sins are called debts</HI>? For an <HI>Answer</HI> we are to know in the gene|ral, that they are not so properly, but meta|phorically, with allusion to those debts that are contracted between man and man; for God is not to be consider'd properly as a <HI>Cre|ditor,</HI> but as a <HI>Governour</HI>; so that in strict sense our obedience (rather than our sin) is our debt to God, and such a debt as we owe to him by the Law of our Creation; so that our sins are called our debts only because sin doth make punishment to become a debt which we owe unto God, and 'tis our just debt, and of the <HI>two</HI> it is <HI>punishment</HI> which man doth suffer for sin that comes nearer to the nature and no|tion of a debt than sin it self, this being a due debt to Gods Justice, as <HI>obedience</HI> is to his
<PB N="187" REF="106">
Authority, however we cannot pray that this debt of punishment be remitted, except we beg that guilt (which is an obligation to punishment) be first removed. (3ly) We have the <HI>illustration</HI> of the matter of this Petition, by an apt similitude or resemblance, <HI>sc. as we for|give our debtors</HI>), which words with reference to God, are not to be considered either as a <HI>rule</HI> that God should proceed in the same man|ner, to forgive us as we do others, or as a <HI>stan|dard</HI> that God should measure out so many pardons to us as we give to those who do offend us, but (1) as an <HI>argument,</HI> (2) as an <HI>evidence.</HI> The <HI>argument</HI> proceeds from the Jess to the greater; that if we who have (but as it were) a drop of mercy, can forgive o|thers, how much more will God (who is an Ocean of free-grace and love it self) forgive us; not that our forgiving others is merito|rious of Gods forgiving us. (2) Our forgi|ving others, when 'tis done freely and hear|tily and universally, 'tis a <HI>fruit</HI> of the love and mercy of God shed abroad in our hearts, an <HI>evidence</HI> of true grace in the soul, or of sancti|fication, and those whom he has sanctified he has also justified.</P>

<P><HI>Expl.</HI> 106. In this Petition there are two things necessarily suppos'd, as (1) The <HI>wickedness</HI> or perversness of mans nature to sin, for when we beg that God would not lead us into temp|tation, we do own a proneness to fall into it. (2) The <HI>weakness</HI> of mans nature to resist temptations, or to come off without any final damage when we are tempred, for therefore do we pray to God to deliver us from evil; that if the wise God, in his wise and just pro|vidence, for holy and just ends, do so order things, that we be assaulted by the Devil, the World, or the Flesh, yet that God would so powerfully support and assist us by his Grace and Spirit that we be not overcome, but that
<PB N="189" REF="107">
we may recover as a Bird out of the snare of the Fowler. We do not absolutely pray a|gainst afflictions (though these are also ten|tations) and <HI>lead us not, &amp;c.</HI> but we do ab|solutely pray to be delivered from the <HI>evil</HI> of sin, and this by God alone, who can bring good out of evil.</P>

worth and merit in our selves; for we are not to say, Lord do thus and thus, for I am worthy, for whom thou shouldst do so and so, but <HI>for thine is the Kingdom, &amp;c. i. e.</HI> Thou who hast commanded us to pray for what we need, hast <HI>Power</HI> to give us what we beg, though in our selves never so <HI>unworthy.</HI> From that word therefore [<HI>Lord</HI>] we may note, (1) That answering of prayers is a special part of Gods providence in governing the world, which he will have every supplicant to own and acknowledg. The belief of a providence is very necessary to the offering up unto God the sacrifice of prayer. (2) From those words [<HI>and the Power</HI>] we may note, <HI>sc.</HI> That what God may do as Governour of the world, in answering prayers by virtue of his supreme Authority, that he hath strength and ability to execute and perform.
