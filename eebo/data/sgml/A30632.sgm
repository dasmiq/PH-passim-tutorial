<P>I Present you in the following Letters, the true Idea (as I take it)
of Church-Government; which could it be received by all others, with
the same degree of Candour I assure my self it shall by you, would be
of infinite Advantage to end those fatal Controversies that for many
Ages have perplexed, and, in this last, almost destroyed the Church.</P>
<P>I prefer the way of Letters to set out the Notion, for two Reasons: One,
because it is the more Insinuative, and a way that is much taken, at this
Time; The other, because really there were Letters sent by a Non-con. to a
Conf. in which most of the things were said that are in these; only now
they come refined from all the Reflections that were Personal, and from some
Mistakes.</P>
<P>For my own part, I have nothing of Fondness in me for any Opinions;
nor do I hold my self obliged unto these in the Letters, further than as they
shall endure the Tests of Truth: I am very willing they should undergo them
all, by strict Examination; though, I confess, I am as loth they should
<PB REF="3">
be put to <HI>Torture.</HI> If upon the severest Enquiry any thing can be found
in them, or duly inferred from them, as to the Main, that will not stand
with good Authority, sound Reason, good Order of Policy, or Christian
Piety, I shall soon shake Hands with them: But till then I cannot believe
it any Crime to own what I am fully perswaded of, and what I am sure
is no Popery, That Ecclesiastical Government is a Prudential thing and

<HEAD>THE FIRST
LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT must be acknowledged that you took a very right Method in the Business
of Church Government, to search, (as you say you did) into its very Ori|ginal;
and had not some of the Prejudices of your Education, or of your
Circumstances; stuck too fast to you, I suppose that way you would at least
have discovered the Institution of the twelve Apostles at first, before our Lord's
Passion, and of the seventy Disciples to have been only Temporary; as well as in
Accommodation to the Mosaical Policy, in which were twelve Philarchs or Heads
of Tribes, and seventy Elders.</P>
<P>After our Lords Passion, when he was risen again from the Dead, and about
to Ascend into Heaven, concerning himself no further with the seventy (of whom
under that Denomination, we read nothing afterwards in the Christian Church)
he gives a new and large Commission to the twelve Apostles, and assigns them two
Works. The First, the making of Disciples or Christians all the World over, by
declaring and publishing every where, what, upon their own Knowledge, they
were certain of, in reference to Christ, that so, by being Witnesses unto him,
they might both aver the Truth of Christianity, and (being many) even compel
Belief of it. And after they had made Christians, to put them under Orders, ac|cording
to the Rules which Christ had given them, <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 3. In two Words the
Apostles were first to make Christians, and then to frame them into Churches.</P>
<P>In this properly the nature of an Apostle consisted, that he was a Person autho|rized
to preach the Gospel of Christ upon his own Knowledge, as being himself a
Witness of him; and in this his Office differed from that of an Evangelist; for
though an Evangelist, as such, did preach the Gospel where it was not heard of
before, and consequently made Christians and planted Churches, in which his
Office agrees with that of an Apostle; yet herein it differs, That to be an Evan|gelist&punc;
it was not necessary (as it was to be an Apostle) that he should be a Wit|ness
<PB N="2" REF="4">
to Christ; it was enough to qualifie an Evangelist, for Evangelizing that he
had certain Tradition; but to be qualified for an Apostle, he must, by the Eviden|ces
of his own Senses have had certain Knowledge of Christ. This Notion of the
Apostleship is not only couched by our Saviour in what he tells the Apostles,
<HI>Iohn</HI> 14. 26. and at his Ascension, <HI>Acts.</HI> 1. 8. but is intimated also in the History
of the Election of <HI>Matthias</HI> unto the Apostleship, <HI>Acts</HI> 1. from 15 to the
26. and most plainly set out in all of them taken together in conjunction, for so
they make it demonstrable. <HI>Iudas</HI> was once numbred with the Apostles, as being
one of the twelve, but he fell from that Degree and Honour by his Transgressions,
and therefore that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which had said another should
succeed him, <HI>Peter</HI> at an Assembly of the Believers proposes the Ordination of one
in his Room. And the better to regulate the Election, he first instructs them in
the Nature of the Office, and Work of the Apostleship, to which that Ordination
was to be made, and this he says, is, with the rest of the Apostles, to be a Witness
unto Christ, and particularly to his Resurrection; and then informs them, how a
person must be qualified to become capable of being ordained to this Office, to wit,
that he must be one of those that had accompanied with them, all the while the
Lord Jesus went in and out among them, even from beginning to end, from first
to last, <HI>Beginning from the baptism of</HI> John, <HI>unto that same day that he was taken up
from them;</HI> He must, it seems, be such an one as had always been with the Lord,
or else he could not be qualified to be one of the twelve <GAP DESC="foreign">,
says <HI>Peter,</HI> therefore must one of these Men that have accompanied with
us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And why must one of these? but that it was the proper Business and
Work of such an Apostle, as was one of the twelve, to be a Witness of Christ to
all that he had said, and done, and suffered; and none could be such a Witness
but one that had been always with him, from first to last.</P>
<P>And if the former is the true Idea of an Apostle (as you may plainly see it is)
then no Diocesan Bishop or any Body else indeed can be one now, for whoever is
an Apostle must be a Witness to Christ, and must have seen him, and that too
after his Resurrection: And to be one of the twelve, must also have been always
with him from first to last, even to S. <HI>Paul</HI> himself, who having not con|versed
with Christ upon the Earth, and therefore could not properly be
one of the twelve, our Lord appeared in an extraordinary manner to qualifie
him for the Apostleship; so that as all the Apostles were Extraordinary Officers,
it might be said of <HI>Paul,</HI> that he was an extraordinary superadded Apostle.</P>
<P>It is true the Apostles were called Bishops by S. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> but it had been more
(though even then not much) to your purpose if he had called Bishops Apostles
(as somewhere he does:) Christ is called a Bishop, and that by a greater Man
than <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and yet I believe you will not infer from thence, that the Bishops are
Christs, or are the Successors of Christ. I acknowledg also, That the Apostle|ship
is stiled an Episcopacy or a Bishoprick, <HI>Acts</HI> 1. But then it is called in the
same Chapter a Deaconry too, verse 25. and therefore I hope you will no more
infer, That an Apostleship and a Bishoprick are the same thing from the com|munication
of the Names, than for the same Reason, That the Apostleship and a
Deaconry are so.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
The Apostleship was an Episcopacy, but not such an Episcopacy as that is which
you contend for, any more than because it was called a Deaconry, it was such a
Deaconry as that which was not instituted till some time after, <HI>Acts</HI> 6. Episcopacy
is a word of ample Signification; for, not to mention prophane Authors, as
<HI>Homer, Plutarch, Cicero,</HI> &amp;c. in which we read the word: It is certain <HI>Basil</HI> ap|plies
it often unto God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil in Rom. in Plat. 32. &amp; alibi.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> in his first Epistle applies it unto the Elders, and
here in the <HI>Acts</HI> 1. it is applied unto the Apostles; and therefore being a word
of so general signification, nothing is deducible from it, as to the special nature
of any Office, except by way of Analogy.</P>
<P>To be plain with you, the Writers of the First Century (<HI>Cyprian</HI> was in the
Third) had no thoughts that appear of any such Succession of Bishops in the
Office of the Apostleship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignat. in Epist. ad Smyrn. &amp; alibi.</NOTE> as you imagine; even that <HI>Ignatius</HI> you so much admire
and who pleads so much for the Prelacy of Bishops, though he compares them
sometimes to God, and other times to Christ (which I believe you insist not up|on,
because you thought it a little too much), yet he never that I can find com|pares
them to the Apostles: Their College, if you will believe <HI>Ignatius,</HI> was
imitated, not to say succeeded by the Presbytery. I add, That <HI>Eutichius</HI> in
his Annals of <HI>Alexander</HI> tells us, as <HI>Hierom</HI> also does, That St. <HI>Mark</HI> ordained,
that the Presbytery of the Church of <HI>Alexandria</HI> should consist of 12. and no
doubt in Imitation of the College of the Apostles, the Presbytery of that Church
did very early consist of that number, though possibly not so early as to be an In|stitution
of the Evangelist <HI>Mark.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Clem. Epist. ad Corinth.</NOTE> In fine, not one word in <HI>Clemens Romanus;</HI> a
Writer of the First Age, of any such Succession of Bishops distinct from Presby|ters,
in the Office of the Apostleship; He knew but Two Orders of Apostolical
Institution, to wit, the Bishops and Deacons; of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>Now if the proper Work and Office of the Apostles consisted in their being, by
Office, the first Preachers, and Witnesses of Christ, by whom they were imme|diately
sent for that purpose, then certainly that Work and Office, as well as their
Mission to it, was extraordinary, and but Temporary. And if after they had
made Christians by their Preaching, and had framed them under perpetual stand|ing
Orders, they did on some occasions interpose their own Authority, either by
way of Direction upon new Emergences, or else for Reformation of Abuses and
Miscarriages; That was extraordinary too, and by vertue of a Jurisdiction natu|rally
arising, and remaining in them, (as also in the Evangelists) as they were
the Fathers and Founders of Churches.</P>
<P>But that this Authority which was paramount and extraordinary, is devolved
upon any other Persons, as Successors of the Apostles, lyes on you to evince;
and I think it is an hard Province: For either the Apostles instituted such Successors
which you call Bishops, (and I for distinction-sake will call Prelates) while them|selves
were living; or else they did not Institute and Induct them while themselves
were living, but only ordained, That after their Decease there should be such
Prelates in the Church, as their Successors, but not before. If you say the
Apostles instituted and inducted Prelates as their Successors while themselves were
living, I demand how that could be? Can any come into the places of others,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
even while these others possess them? And again I demand, whether there were, or
could be any Officers instituted by the Apostles over whom themselves retained
not Jurisdiction? for if the Apostles retained their Jurisdiction (which I suppose
you will not deny) over the Prelates they instituted (if they instituted any;)
Then they trans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">erred not their Jurisdiction to these Prelates, that is, the Pre|lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
were not such Successors of the Apostles as you conceit them; for none does
give that which he keeps. I believe therefore you will say, the Apostles did not
Institute and Induct the Prelates while themselves were living, but ordained,
that after their Decease there should be such in the Churches, as their Successors.
But where I pray you is the ordinance recorded? In what Scripture, In what
Fathers of the First Age? or how came you to know of such an Order? if no
Tradition either of the Holy Scripture, or of the most Ancient and Primitive Fa|thers
transmits it?</P>
<P>All of any Aspect this way, in any Father of the First Age, is in <HI>Clemens Romanus,</HI>
and he is against you;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clem. Ep. ad Corinth.</NOTE> for having premised what is very remarkable, and much to
our purpose, That the Apostles knowing through our Lord Jesus Christ the strife
that would one day be about the business or name of Episcopacy, <GAP DESC="foreign">,
he adds, that for that Cause (to wit, to end such
strife) they ordained Bishops and Deacons, <GAP DESC="foreign">, They
appointed the forementioned Officers, and the Officers forementioned were only
Bishops and Deacons, of whom he had said before, <GAP DESC="foreign">
they, (namely the Apostles) appointed the first fruits (of those Cities
and Countries where they had preached) approving of them by the Spirit for
the Bishops and Deacons of those that should afterward believe.</P>
<P>This is a plain Testimony (so plain, that I see not how it can be evaded) that
the Holy Apostles instituted only Two Orders of Officers in the Church, of
which one indeed was that of the Bishops: But this Order of Bishops being the
Order that is Contradistinguisht unto that of the Deacons as well in this Father
and in others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cipryan Ep. l. 3. Ep. 9.</NOTE> as in the sacred Scriptures, it must be understood of the Presbyte|rian,
and not of the Prelatical Orders.</P>
<P>And when Intimated that the two Orders of Bishops and Deacons were the fixed
standing Orders, which the Apostles had instituted, to continue in the Church
from time to time, I did it with good Authority; for <HI>Clement</HI> having asserted that
the Apostles instituted Bishops and Deacons, to put an end to all Contentions
about the Office of Episcopacy (which would have been endless had not the
Apostles thus provided against it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clem, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bi supra.</NOTE>) He adds, And moreover they gave it in dire|ction,
That as often as it should happen that those Persons whom they had ap|pointed
should decease, others that were approved and worthy should receive
their Charges.</P>
<P>By this time you may see how little that transaction about the Incestuous Co|rinthian
on which you insist so much, does serve your purpose: For S. <HI>Paul</HI> his
Interposition in that business was purely Apostolical and Extraordinary, from
beginning to end, the Cognisance he took was Extraordinary, by his Apostolical
<PB N="5" REF="5">
Spirit or Revelation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierom. Com. in Ep. 1. ad Cor.</NOTE> as <HI>Hierome</HI> interprets it (absent in Body, but present in
Spirit;) The Censure Extraordinary, which was to give the Incestuous up unto
Satan, as to a Tormentor: So <HI>Hierome</HI> carries this also; and the manner of the
Execution extraordinary too, to wit, by delegation of his Apostolical Spirit, to
the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> (when you come together and my Spirit.) So that the
whole Proceeding was extraordinary; and though you are pleased to call it an
Act of Episcopal or Prelatical Authority, and to make an Argument of it for
Diocesan Jurisdiction; yet, unless you can find Diocesans now that have the
Spirit, that can have a Cognisance of things at Distance by Revelation, that can
give up Persons to Satan as to a Tormentor, and that can delegate their Spirit to
a Congregation, the Exception lying against it will still continue in Force.</P>
<P>Wherefore as yet I see no other Prelacy instituted by the Apostles, but that of
the Presbyters over the People; nor are there any Officers now of any Denomina|tion,
which ought to have (though you seem to intimate that some ought) a Mission
like to that of the Apostles; for as they were Ambassadours, that were sent
immediately by Christ, as he was by God, and brought their Credentials with
them, sealed by the Holy Ghost; so I will not scruple to call them Extraordi|nary
upon this Account too, any more than to call the Presbyters and Deacons
ordinary, even though the Papists and the Socinians do so: The first Missions
were extraordinary, whiles the Church was to be constituted; but in a consti|tuted
setled Church, in which the Officers are ordinary, their Calling is so
likewise.</P>
<P>But to let you know what Standard there is of Extraordinaries, (for this you
demand) I believe I have no more to do but to remind you of what you already
know, that the use of speaking or common Language is that Standard; for cer|tain,
you that have read so often in <HI>Cicero</HI> (not to mention <HI>Livy, Suetonius</HI> and
others) of <HI>Honores Extraordinarii, Praesidium Extraordinarium, Potestas Extraor|dinaria,</HI>
cannot be ignorant that that is Extraordinary, which being not the set|led
standing perpetual order and use, is only for some certain time, and on some
particular special Occasion or Accident. And it is in this sense of the word that
the Roman Magistrates, in respect of time, are distributed by <HI>Lipsius</HI> into Extra|ordinary
and Ordinary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lips. tract. de Magist. Vet. Pop. Rom. c. 2.</NOTE> when he says, <HI>Aut enim (Magistratus) &agrave; tempo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ibus di|viduntur,
ut Ordina ii Extraordina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ii. Illi dicti qui statis Temporibus, &amp; semper
in Republic&acirc; essent, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Consul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Praetores, Ediles, Tribuni, Quaestores; isti qui nec eo|dem
tempore, nec semper, ut Dictatores, Censores, Inter-Reges, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is true you tell me, that the Commission, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. is not peculiar to the
Apostles, and that therefore it does not Evidence, they were Extraordinary Offi|cers;
for (say you) <Q>There is indeed a Charge given them to Baptize and Teach,
but it seems a wonderful way of proving them to be Extraordinary Officers, from
the Authority they had to do that which any Ordinary Minister may do: and
that by vertue of this Commission.</Q></P>
<P>By vertue of this Commission! Excuse me as to that, every Body will not
yield it; some think, that this Commission was personal, given only unto the
Apostles. <HI>Go ye;</HI> and inforced with a promise that related only to them direct|ly,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<HI>Lo I am with you to the end of the world;</HI> That is, to the Consummation of
the Mosaical <HI>Seculum;</HI> for so they understand that Phrase, and apprehend, they
have sufficient Reason to do so, upon comparing it with <HI>Matth.</HI> 24. 3, 14.</P>
<P>But let that be as it will. Indeed! Is the Commission given to the Apostles,
<HI>Matth.</HI> 28. not peculiar to them? Are they Empowered by it to do no more than
every ordinary Minister may? I had thought that ordinary Ministers had been
limited and local, not unlimited and oecumenical Officers; and that, by their In|stitution,
they were confin'd to Teach and Rule the particular Churches over
which they were appointed, and not to Teach and Rule the whole World, or (as
the Apostles had) to have care of all the Churches. I pray tell me, is a Parish-Priest
of as great Authority, as a Diocesan? and yet a Diocesan compared with
an Apostle, is less than a Parish-Priest: The whole World was the Diocess of the
Apostles. <HI>Go ye, teach all Nations.</HI></P>
<P>I profess I am much surprized to find you deny, without Distinction, that the
Apostles were Extraordinary Officers; especially after Dr. <HI>Cave</HI> in his History of
the Lives of the Apostles (which I believe you have read) distinguishes their
work, and shews what was Extraordinary in it, and what was Ordinary. But
possibly you foresaw, that should you have spoken plainly, and have said as he
does, that their ordinary work [the standing and perpetual part of it, was to
Teach and Instruct the People in the Duties and Principles of Religion; to Ad|minister
the Sacraments; to Institute Guides and Officers, and to Exercise the
Discipline and Government of the Church.] I would easily reply, That the
Apostles had provided themselves of Successors, as to all this work, but that these
Successors were the Presbyters which they Instituted in every Church, to feed and
govern it; and that having ordained no others, it looks as if they saw no need of
others.</P>
<P>But having this Occasion, I beg your pardon if I use it, to set out more fully the
Institution which the Apostles made, for the Government and Edification of the
Churches, and how that Institution came to be altered, and by what steps.</P>
<P>First then the Apostles instituted a Senate, <GAP DESC="foreign">, a College of Presbyters
in every Church, to Feed and Govern it; and this is evident from <HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23, 25.
where <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> are said not <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the Churches but <GAP DESC="foreign">,
&mdash;in every Church to have ordained Elders; a College of Elders,
not a single Elder or Bishop. And as they are not said to have ordained a
single Bishop or Elder in any Church, so much less are they (said) to have
ordained any Prelate or Intendant over many Churches; every Church, as a Body
Politick Compleat, had sufficient power within it self, for all its Ends: They or|dained
Elders in every Church.</P>
<P>And to me it is plain that <HI>Clement</HI> had regard to this practice of the Apostles,
when, in the place I cited before upon another occasion, he says of them, That go|ing
through Countries and Cities preaching the Gospel, they appointed the first
Fruits of them to be Bishops and Deacons, having approved or Confirmed them by
the Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
That the Apostles instituted many Presbyters, and not a single Presbyter, in
every Church, is further confirmed, not only from the frequent mention of a Pres|bytery
found in <HI>Ignatius,</HI> which (as I shall shew hereafter) was Congregational,
but by the Express Testimony of <HI>Clement,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Clem. epist. ad. Corinth.</NOTE> who blames the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> for
raising a Sedition and Stir against their Presbyters, (and therefore there were
many in that Church) only upon the Account of one or two Persons; so that it
is plain, there was a College of Presbyters in the Ancient Apostolical Church of
<HI>Corinth</HI></P>
<P>Again, in the Presbytery or College, which was ordained in every Church,
though all the Presbyters were equal, the Institution making no Difference; for
<HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> are said to Constitute Elders, but not to Constitute Elders and
a Bishop, as a Superiour over them; yet it being requisite for Order-sake, that
some one in every Assembly should have the Direction, and that Honour naturally
falling on the Eldest Presbyter unless some other Course be resolved; it is most
probable, that at first, the Eldest Presbyter as he had the first Place, so he had
the first Direction of Matters: But afterwards, it being found by Experience,
that the Eldest was not always the Worthiest and Fittest for that purpose, it came
to pass, that the place devolved not any longer by Seniority, but was conferred
by Election: And in this S. <HI>Ambrose</HI> (if it be he, and not rather <HI>Hillary</HI>) in his
Comment on the fourth to the <HI>Ephesians</HI> is plain. <HI>Vid. Sixt. Senens. Bibl. Sanct.
l. 6. annot.</HI> 324.</P>
<P>And admitting that all the Presbyters were called Bishops, as undoubtedly at
first they were, it is easie to conceive how the first Presbyter came to be called the
Bishop, and at last, for Distinction-sake, to have the Name of Bishop so appro|priated
to him, that the rest retained only the Denomination of Presbyters. But
all this while the Bishop was but the first Presbyter, and had no more Authority
in the College of Presbyters, than is allowed to S. <HI>Peter</HI> in the College of the
Apostles, by all Protestants. Even <HI>Epiphanius</HI> himself (if we may believe <HI>Danaeus</HI>)
was at last compelled to confess,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. Com. in August. de haeres. c. 53.</NOTE> That in the Time and Age of the Apostles, no
such Distinction [as that is which you contend for,] was to be found between the
Bishops and Presbyters.</P>
<P>Again, though all the Presbyters in every Church had like Authority to Preach
and Rule, (both Functions being comprehended in the Episcopacy assigned to
them, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 2, 3.) yet some of them being better qualifyed for the one, and
some for the other, it is probable, that they exercised their different Talents
accordingly; some of them more in the one, and some more in the other. This
(as strange as you may make it) seems plainly intimated in that Injunction of the
Apostles, 1 <HI>Tim. 5. 17. Let the Elders that rule well be accounted worthy of double
honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrin:</HI> For here is a plain
Distinction of Elders, of which some being better at Ruling, and some at
preaching, they exercised themselves according to the Talent they had; those
that were better at Ruling, in Ruling, and those that were better at Preaching,
in labouring in the Word and Doctrin.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
And since Labouring in the Word and Doctrin had the special Honour, no
Question but the first Presbyter, as most honourable, was always of the number of
those that laboured that way; so that the Bishop was the Pastour also, or
Preaching Elder, that is, the Preaching Spiritual Work became appropriated to
him, at first Eminently, but afterwards entirely; and then nothing lay in Com|mon
between him and the Presbyters but only Rule. And this is what I can ga|ther
from Scripture of the Apostolical Settlement.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it is evident, That a Diocesan Bishop was unknown in the first
Age of the Church, and the only Bishop to be found then, was the Presbyter;
which is further confirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d, in that the Scot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, who received the Knowledg of
Christianity very early,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spotiswood</HI> Hist. b. 1. f. 4.</NOTE> even in that Age, had not any Knowledge for many Ages
after, that appears, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> any but Presbyterian Jurisdiction. Even Bishop <HI>Spotiswood,</HI>
in his History of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> tells us out of <HI>Boethius,</HI> and <HI>Boethius</HI> from
Ancient Annals, of the Culdees, or Ancient Scottish Priests and Monks (who,
he believes, were called Culdees, not because <HI>Culteres Dei,</HI> as most think, but be|cause
they lived in Cells, their Names, as he says, being <HI>Kele-Dei</HI> and not <HI>Culdei,</HI>
in old Bulls and Rescripts.) He says of these Culdees, That they were wont for
their better Government to elect one of their Number by common Suffrage to be
the Chief and Princip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l among them, without whose Knowledge and Consent no|thing
was done in any Matter of Importance, and the Person so Elected was called
<HI>Scotorum Episcopus,</HI> a Scots Bishop; and this was all the Bishop that he could find
in the first Times: But <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">an</HI> is plainer, who tells us, That no Bishop (to
wit an Order superiour to that of the Presbyters) ever presided in the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> before <HI>Paliadius</HI> his Time; the Church (says he) unto that Time was
Governed by Monks, without Bishops, with less Pride, and outward Pomp but
greater Simplicity and Holiness</P>
<P>Thus I have E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">idenced what the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Things was in the first Times of the
Christian Churches, to wit, that those were governed by Presbyteries, in which
all the Presbyters were equal, and all Bishops, only, for Order-sake, there was
a first Presbyter, who having more Care and more Work, had yet no more
Authority and Power than any other; but as the best Men are but Flesh and Blood,
and the best Institutions lyable to Rust and Canker, so these were not exempted;
there was a Diotrephes in the Apostles own Times, and those that followed him
improved upon the Example: The first Presbyter soon became advanced into ano|ther
Order, and from being First, commenced Prince of the Presbyters.</P>
<P>We are told by <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">naeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">men; ad August. de aeres.</NOTE> who citeth <HI>Epiphanius</HI> (and he might have cited others)
that this Departure from the Primitive Institution began in <HI>Alexand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ia;</HI> and it is
very probable, That the Appointment of twelve Presbyters, besides a President
(for so <HI>Eutichius</HI> assures us it was there) did give occasion to the President, who
easily took the Hint, to challenge to himself the Place and Authority of Christ,
when the very Number of Presbyters, over whom he presided, made it manifest
that they were an Imitation of the Apostles. But whether other Churches took
their Pattern from that of <HI>Alexandria</HI> or no, 'tis easie to conceive in what manner,
and by what means the Mistake might gain upon them: For after the first Presbyter
<PB N="9" REF="7">
became elected, and consequently was separate by Prayer and Imposition of
Hands, no wonder he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oon taken for an Officer of another Order, much Su|periour
unto that of the Presbyters, who was distinguished from them by that To|ken
of a new Ordination, and was in place above them. Ay, it is highly pro|bable,
That the first Recess from the Primitive Institution, even in <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
began this way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">. Epist. 154. ad Gall.</NOTE> if that be true that <HI>Grotius</HI> hath observed, That the Election
of the President Presbyter came not in use there but after the Death of <HI>Mark:</HI> So
that it was not (as <HI>Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ichius</HI> reports it,) an Institution of this Evangelist.</P>
<P>But what way soever this Alteration had its beginning, one may be tempted
(if the Epistles going under the name of <HI>Ignatius</HI> be indeed his) to think that it
had it very early; for this Father doth every where speak of the Bishop in respect
of the Presbyters, as of God in respect of Christ, and of Good or Christ in respect
of the College of the Apostles; and these are such Magnificent Expressions of Su|periority,
that though they proceeded not from any Elation of mind in him that
used them at first, and used them perhaps but as Rhetorick, yet they could not
but occasion other Sentiments in others, <HI>viz.</HI> as of the Bishops being of a Superiour
Order, so, of something of Domination and Lordship in his Office.</P>
<P>And yet how great soever the Degeneracy was in the Time of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> or very
near it, it was not so great then as in the following Ages; <HI>Ignatius</HI> his Bishop for
all the Gawdiness in which he dresses him, was only a Congregational, not a Dio|cesan
Bishop; those first Times knew nothing of the Diocesan Princely Prelate,
even the President, that <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> mentions, was but a Congregational
Pastour.</P>
<P>That <HI>Ignatius</HI> his Bishop was only Pastour of a single Congregation is evident in
many Passages, but I will cite but two or three to evince it. The first is in his
Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> where he speaks of the Prayer of the Bishop, and the
whole Church, ascending in Consort unto God; so that the Bishop was the
Mouth of the Congregation. And afterward, in the same Epistle, in an Exhorta|tion
to these <HI>Ephesians,</HI> when he presses them to obey their Bishop, he speaks of
them, as of a single Congregation, that could meet together for Acts of Worship.
Again, in his Epistle to the <HI>Magnesians,</HI> whom he also presses to obey their Bishop
(for this indeed is the Burthen of all his Epistles,) he plainly speaks of them as of
a single Congregation; Do you all assemble and meet (saith he) <GAP DESC="foreign">, to|gether,
for so that Expression is rendred 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14 23.</P>
<P>I have shewed what the Primitive Institution was, as to Church-Orders, and
have shewed also how and how early, the Alteration that was made in Congrega|tions
came on; It was first a Presbytery, and the Senior Presbyter the President;
then a Presbytery, and the President elected, but still a Presbyter; afterward a
President and no Presbyter, not an <HI>Ab Beth din,</HI> but a <HI>Nasi;</HI> not a Senior Pres|byter,
but a Prince, or chief over the Presbytery. And certainly one need to have
but a little Experience, in the Course of things, to make a clear and distinct
Conception of what hath been said upon this Subject. That which remains to com|pleat
the Discourse, is to shew the same way, from Common Principles, how the
Ecclesiastical Prelate, (or that Bishop over several Congregations) of the better
<PB N="10" REF="8">
fort, such as <HI>Cyprian, Augustin, &amp;c.</HI> (if indeed they were such) did first spring
up.</P>
<P>I conceive (with submission to better Judgments) that this Bishop (of whom
we read nothing that I know of in the first Age, or till towards the end [if
then] of the second,) arose from the large Progression, and spreading of Chri|stianity;
for then in great Cities, and their Appendages, the number of Professors
grew so great, that all could no longer meet together in one place, to Celebrate
Divine Offices, so that necessity compelled them to divide into several Congrega|tions;
which, if settled, must have several Officers, as Bishops, Presbyters and
Deacons; yet still the Bishop of the Mother Congregation as he had the main hand
(which is to be presumed) in forming and settling the Daughter Churches, so
he still pretended to keep an Authority and Jurisdiction over them.</P>
<P>And this indeed had something of a Resemblance unto the Apostles; who as they
planted many Churches, so they had always a Care of them; but how far the Analo|gy
will hold, or where it strikes out, I shall not trouble you now to say; It is
enough for the present to have shewed, that Ecclesiastical Prelates had not Aposto|lical
Institution, and that, at best, they arose but by Occasions, and Prudentially
only, upon the Increase of Believers.</P>
<P>What confirms this Notion is, That we never read in the first Age, and but
rarely (if ever) in the second, of Bishops that pretended it of themselves, or
that were affirmed by others, to be the Successors of the Apostles. In those first
times, no such Pretentions had place; but afterwards, when necessity arose in the
Churches of sending out their Colonies, then the Bishops of those Churches, that
sent them out, soon found, in the Jurisdiction of the Apostles, something, that by
way of Analogy, and with a little stretching might serve to countenance theirs,
over those that they had settled.</P>
<P>These are the Sentiments I have as to the <HI>Ius Divinum</HI> of Episcopacy; in
which I have made evident what Episcopacy it is I do believe is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ure Divino,</HI> and
what not: But I intend not to Discourse now of the <HI>Ius Ecclesiasticum,</HI> by which
only a Diocesan Bishop, or of the <HI>Ius Civile,</HI> by which the Lord Bishop is Consti|tuted.
My Province now, is only to shew, what I have shewed, that the Presby|ter
is the only Bishop <HI>Iure Divino &amp; Apostolico;</HI> and that Prudential Considera|tions
only made the Prelate, first the Congregational, and afterward the Diocesan
Prelate, of the better sort. And in these Assertions I have my Vouchers, and
those Fathers, and Fathers as learned, and as Pious as any Churches ever owned,
and cited too by Bishop <HI>Iewell.</HI></P>
<P>Verily (saith he) <HI>Chrysostom</HI> saith, <Q><HI>Inter Episcopum &amp; Presbyterum interest ferm&egrave;

he setteth Deacons before Priests, that is to say, before Bishops: whereas the

Bishops by him, as well as by S <HI>Paul.</HI></Q></P>
<P>By what I have said you may see how little Satisfaction I received in the Proofs
you gave me of the early distinction between Bishops and Presbyters, for none of
them do reach home unto the First Age, and to the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ocesan Prelatical Bishop;
and if they did, would move me but little. For as for <HI>Tertullian,</HI> he more than
seems to be on my side, when speaking of the Christian <HI>Congregations,</HI> both as to
their Discipline and Government, and to their Worship, he says, <HI>Praesident probati
quique seniores, Hon remistum non pretio, sed Testimonio adepti;</HI> That the Presbyters
have the Rule and Government in them.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> his Imitations of the Angelical Glory [<GAP DESC="foreign">],
in which you do imagine you have found the orders of the
Celestial Hierarchy, imitated in the Bishop, Presbyter and Deacon; this is but
a Flourish of Rhetorick in that Father; who though in his <HI>Pedagogue</HI> he speaks of
Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, as also of Widows; yet in his <HI>Stromata (Lib.
6. &amp;</HI> 7.) where he treats of the Ecclesiastical Orders more at large, he mentions
but Two, the Presbyters, and Deacons, and plainly intimates, that the Bishop
was only a Presbyter honoured with the first Seat.</P>
<P>But I am much surprized at your Citation of the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI> his Epistle to
<HI>Servianus</HI> recorded by <HI>Phlegon,</HI> and related by <HI>Vopiscus;</HI> for certainly it appears
by that Epistle that <HI>Adrian</HI> had but little Acquaintance with the Egyptian Chri|stians,
and then, his Authority is of as little moment; or else, these Christians
were of the worst of Men; for he represents them, as well as the other Inhabi|tants
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to be a most seditious, vain, and most Injurious sort of Men, and
particularly says, That those which Worship <HI>Serapis</HI> were Christians, and that
the Bishops of Christ were devoted unto <HI>Serapis:</HI> He adds, That the very Patri|arch
<PB N="12" REF="9">
(<HI>Ipse ille Patriarcha</HI>) coming into <HI>Egypt,</HI> was constrained of some to Wor|ship
<HI>Serapis,</HI> and others (to Worship) Christ. Was ever any thing more viru|lently
said of Christians? and indeed more mistakingly? for as for the Devotion
of their Bishops to <HI>Serapis,</HI> I cannot imagine any occasion that these Christians
should give, which, with any Colour, should render them suspected of that Ido|latry,
but their Signing with the Sign of the Cross; and this might, it being a
way of professing Christianity, that at that Time was newly become the Mode,
and probably it had the Fate of New Modes, which is, to be approved of by some,
and be rejected and nick-named of others.</P>
<P>I am the more inclined to think that this Story of <HI>Serapis</HI> had some relation to
the Christian Bishops, who signed with the Sign of the Cross, because I find in
<HI>Pignorius,</HI> in his Exposition of the <HI>Mensa Isaica,</HI> that <HI>Serapis</HI> was used to be de|noted
by a Cross, <HI>Vrceo</HI> (says he) <HI>superne infixa Crux Serapidem notat.</HI> And
says <HI>Rhodiginus, Lect. ant. l. 10. c. 8, 9. figuram ejusmodi;</HI> (speaking of the Cross)
<HI>Serapidis pectori insculp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bant Egyp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ii:</HI> Adding, out of <HI>Suidas,</HI> That in the time of
the Emperour <HI>Theodosius,</HI> when the Temples of the Greeks were destroyed, there
were found in the Sacrary of <HI>Serapis</HI> certain Hieroglyphic Letters which resembled
a Cross. But to let this pass, I see no cogency in the Citation you make from
the Emperour <HI>Adrian</HI> to evidence any such Distinction between a Bishop and a
Presbyter to have been in that time as is in ours, and as you do plead for; for in
that Epistle there is only the Name of Bishop and Presbyter, without any specifi|cation
of Office signified by it, either as to its Nature or Limits; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d possibly
some will tell you, That by the Coherence of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e Epistle, it is not so clear, but
that <HI>Adrian</HI> might intend the same Officers by Bishop and Presbyter. But I have no
list to engage in such a Dispute; and therefore hasten to tell you what is above
any, that I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND
LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Expected, that as I had essayed to set out a <HI>Scheme</HI> of Church-Government,
and such a one as I believed and do still believe, to have been the Primitive
and Original, and of Apostolical Institution; so you likewise would have
given a Scheme according to your Sentiments; and then, by Comparing
Scheme with Scheme, and each with the Account of the Scriptures, and other un|doubted
Accounts of the first Century, we might at last come to have made a surer
Judgment, which was the Right and which the Wrong, than now, in the parcelling
and retailing way you take, it is possible to do.</P>
<P>Indeed, to gain a true Light into the Nature and Frame of Church-Government,
in the whole extent of it, one ought to distinguish the several States and Circum|stances
in which the Church hath been, and accordingly consider the several Or|ders,
which were in it, in those several States, and the Grounds and Reasons of
those several Orders. Now the Church (I speak of the Catholick or Evange|lical
Church) may be considered, either as it was a Constituting, before it had
received External Form and Shape, as to Orders: Or after it was Constituted;
and that the Apostles, who had not only received Instructions from their Master
what to do in things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, but were likewise invited
by the concidence of Events, had put their last Hand unto it.</P>
<P>Again, the Church, after its being Constituted and Clothed with Orders, under|goes
a Double Consideration, for it may be considered, either as it subsisted and
stood alone, singly, in a State of Separation from Secular <HI>Governments</HI> of the World,
or as it is united to them by the Laws and Ordinances (that in several Countries
are several) which they have enacted and established about it.</P>
<P>Whosoever considers the Church whilst constituting, before it had received its
external Form and Orders, ought at the same time to acknowledg, That of neces|sity
there must be persons to constitute it, and cloth it with these Orders; which
<PB N="14" REF="10">
persons, if vested with Authority so to do, are properly Officers: but yet, in that
performance, cannot be conceived to be or act as ordinary Officers, these being
permanent and standing, and belonging to the Church as constituted; whereas that
Office had its place before the Constitution of the Church, as being ordained to
constitute it.</P>
<P>This Office (as I evinced in my former Paper) appertained to the Apostles,
it being their Work to lay the Foundation of the Christian Church, by preaching
the Doctrin of Christ, as true upon their own Knowledg, and consequently
making Believers or Disciples, which was to gather the Church; as also by insti|tuting
of Officers, and giving Rules about them; which was to put the Church un|der
Orders, and to settle its Government.</P>
<P>On this Account the Church is said to be built upon the Foundation of the Apo|stles
and the New Jerusalem, the City of God, (or the Evangelical Church in its
most reformed State) is described in the <HI>Revelations</HI> to have twelve Foundations,
answering to the twelve Apostles; who by the Doctrin which they preached and
witnessed, and the Order which they setled, did indeed lay the Foundation of the
Christian Church, and set it on foot.</P>
<P>It is true, the Evangelists as well as the Apostles were (in part at least) the
Founders of particular Churches; But the Apostles only (with the Prophets)
have the Honour of being stiled Founders of the Church; these being the only per|sons
that were commissioned by our Lord Christ for that end: He immediately send|ing
and directing his Apostles, but these sending and directing the Evangelists, who
are therefore called by some (and not unfitly) <HI>Apostoli Secondarii,</HI> Apostles of
the Second Order: So that I do distinguish between the Founding of the Church
which was done by the Apostles only; and that of particular Churches, which was
performed by the Evangelists as well as by the Apostles.</P>
<P>By the Church, which for distinction sake I call Essential, to discriminate it
from particular Constituted Churches, I mean nothing but the whole Multitude
or Company of the Faithful, as they are united to Christ, and hold Communion
with him, as well as one with another, by one Common Faith, and by the parti|cipation
of the Holy Spirit. And of this Church all that do believe in, and make
a true Profession of Christ (though as yet they are not ranked in any particular
one) are Members, and have their several Uses, according to the Measure of the
Dispensation given them; from which Measure some are Principal and some are
less Principal Members; <HI>He gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Essential Church, though it is a kind of a Body, Society and City, yet it
is not a Secular Politick Body; I mean not a Body, united in it self, under one
External Visible Head, by any Universal Politick Orders and Dependencies that
run throughout it, such as are in Secular Governments, whether Monarchical,
Aristocratical or Democratical, to make them one. But it is a Spiritual Mystical
Body, a Body united unto Christ the Head by the Spirit of Faith and Love, under
the Laws and Rules of Christianity; a Religion which obliges all its Members to
Communion one with another (as much as is possible) for mutual Edification and
Comfort.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="10">
Could all the Members of the Christian Church have held Communion one with
another, and ordinarily have met together for the Discharge of Common Duties
and Offices; and all have been subject unto one External Government, common
to them, there would still have been but one Congregation of them, as there was at
first, and consequently but one Church, as to External Orders.</P>
<P>But the Christian Church, in the nature of it, being Catholick and Univers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,
that is, not walled in and confined by distinguishing Rites and Customs, as the
Jewish was, unto a particular People, but lying in common to all Nations, as
much as unto any; so that such External Communion and Government was abso|lutely
impracticable in the whole, as taken together; therefore it was necessary
that it should be practised (as indeed it was) only by Parts, each of which Parts
was to bear the Denomination of the Whole, as being the whole in Little. This
is the Original of particular Churches; in reference to which Churches it may be
observed, That as the Jewish Church (which some call the Synagogue) was
founded in a Nation, so the Christian Church, eminently stiled the Church, was
founded in a particular Assembly; the Mother Church at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was only a
single Congregation. It was for the former Reason, as well as for others, that
the Apostles, when they instituted Church-Government, did not give any General
Scheme that should relate to the Catholick Church, as to an External Body, or to
Provincial, or to National Churches; but they only setled Particular Churches,
as Homogenecal Parts of the Whole: And these in this Order, That as the whole
Church was a free People that had not one only, but many Apostles, who, by the
Original Institution, were to take the Care of it; so in every particular Church
(which was to be a Vicinage under Orders, or a Company of Professing People,
that could conveniently meet together for the Discharge of Christian Offices)
there should be not one only, but many Presbyters (a College of Presbyters an|swering
to the College of the Apostles,) who should Rule and Govern, but as
over a Free People, and therefore, in all material Businesses, with their Approba|tion
and Suffrage.</P>
<P>Thus in the Mother-Church at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> besides the Apostles, which were Ex|traordinary,
there was a <HI>Senate</HI> or College of Elders, as the ordinary standing Offi|cers;
and these, with the whole Church, or Body of the People and Brethren,
are convented upon the Business of <HI>Antioch,</HI></P>
<P>And thus the Apostles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> every where, in every Church or
Congregation, are said to have established a Senate or Presbyters, and that too by
the Suffrage or <GAP DESC="foreign"> of the People.</P>
<P>So that the Original Government of the Church, of Apostolical Institution, was
only Congregational; which Congregational Government consisted of the People
or Brethren, and of the Presbyters or Senate; in which Senate he that presided, tho'
in process of Time he was called Bishop, by appropriation of the Name which all
the Presbyters enjoyed at first in Common, yet, in the <HI>Original Institution</HI> (he)
was no more than the first-named Presbyter, and so no otherwise distinguished in
<HI>it,</HI> than as <HI>Peter</HI> (was) in the Institution of the College of the Apostles, who is
still first named in it. And <HI>such</HI> a Bishop I do acknowledg to have been from
<PB N="16" REF="11">
great Antiquity, namely, a Congregational Bishop, that had the first Direction
of Matters, a Person that was <HI>Primus, Presbyter,</HI> a Presbyter only in Order, and
the first of that Order in the College of Presbyters: But a Diocesan Bishop invested
with the Power of sole Ordination and Jurisdiction, and he a Suffragan too (for
this is the Bishop that is in Controversie between us,) this Bishop you must prove,
if you can, and nothing is done if you do not prove him to be Apostolical.</P>
<P>Sure I am that S. <HI>Cyprian</HI> considered himself but as a first Presbyter; and there|fore
as his Name for the Bishop is always <HI>prepositus,</HI> in respect of the People: So
he calls the Presbyters his Compresbyters, <HI>Ep. l. 4. ep.</HI> 8. [<HI>Ques ed primitivum
Compresbyterum nostrum: Et l. 4. ep. 6. Literae tuae per Quintum Compresbyterum missae.</HI>
Ay! the 25th Epistle of the 3d Book is directed to (his) Compresbyters. And
in the 24th Epistle of the same Book he calleth <HI>Rogatianus</HI> his Compresbyter; but
he no where calls the Deacous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">s Condeacors; clearly implying by that Deno|mination,
that when he was made Bishop he ceased not to be a Presbyter, as not
become of another Order, only he was now a President in it, and possessed of the
first Chair. I do not find you deny the Institution of the Presbytery (the which
I have abundantly evinced,) or so much, that in the first Times, the Bishop was
only the President of it, or the first Presbyter, which yet is the main of the Cause:
And you can as little deny, if you will be just, the Power and Interest of the Peo|ple,
who are called in Scripture sometimes the Church and sometimes the Brethren,
and in <HI>Tertullian</HI> and <HI>Cyprian</HI> the <HI>Phbs.</HI> Thus you find in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI>
the People concerned in the Election of <HI>Matihias [Peter</HI> spake to the whole As|sembly,
<HI>Men and Brethren,</HI> &amp;c.] So in that of the Deacons [<HI>Wherefore Brethren
look you cut among you seven men of honest report,</HI> &amp;c.] And in the Ordination of
the Presbyters, for <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bas,</HI> ordained with the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of the People,
<HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23. Again, they are concerned in the Censure of the Incestuous Corin|thian,
not only by way of Approbation, as where it is said, <HI>When you are gathered
together,</HI> &amp;c. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 4. but by way of Judgment and Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cution, verfe 12, 13.
In fine, even in the Debate and Decision of Controversies; for <HI>the brethren were
together with the apostles and elders, and there was much disputing,</HI> (which, I should
think, was rather among the People than among the Apostles and Elders:) And
the Decretal Epistle goes <HI>as well in the name of the brethren as in that of the apostles

the Congruity of the <HI>Old Testamet,</HI> and the Practice recorded in the <HI>New;</HI> not
only allowing to them (as some would have it) a presence in all Transactions, but
affirming their Power (<HI>Cypri n</HI>'s Word is <HI>potestas</HI>) and their Suffrage. <HI>Propter

much as they, principally, have the power both of electing worthy Priests, and of
rejecting the unworthy.</P>
<P>This is further evident in the Resolve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cypr. Epist. l. 3. Ep. 10.</NOTE> that <HI>Cyprian</HI> (as himself professes)
assumed at his coming first to the Bishoprick, which was, That he would do
nothing of business by himself, and singly without the Counsel of the Elders,
and Deacons, nor without the Consent of the People: <HI>Solus rescribere nil

<P>In fine, in <HI>Clemins Romanus,</HI> who preceded <HI>Cyprian,</HI> as living in the Age of
the very Apostles themselves, we have a plain Intimation of the Interest and
Right of the People, in the Election of Presbyters, and in their Rejection;
from which also we may conclude the share they had in other matters; for in his
Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> he says, Those who were appointed by the Apostles,
or by other Excellent Men <GAP DESC="foreign">, with the Consent
and Approbation of the whole Church, and who lived worthily, ought
not to be (injuriously) deprived of their Ministration. [And, by the way, this
Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">imony of <HI>Clement</HI> shews in what senfe it is said, that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> did
Chirotonize Elders, it being evident that it relates to that which stands upon
Record in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> of what was done by those Two in that kind
of business.] After the former evidences, I do not see how it can be questi|oned,
that the Government of particular Churches was at first (what I have
affirmed it) Popular and Democratical, as consisting of the Authority of a Se|nate,
and of the power of a People, or in S. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Language, of the Ma|jesty
of the People, and the Authority of Priesthood: Thus resembling the
Greek Republicks and their <HI>Ecclesiae,</HI> or popular Assemblies, which, at <HI>Athens,</HI>
were composed of <HI>Proedri,</HI> who directed and ordered matters, and of the People
who voted. And even <HI>Origen</HI> against <HI>Celsus,</HI> L. 7. as Mr. <HI>Thorndike</HI> tells me (for
I have not <HI>Origen</HI> at present by me) compares the Government of the Churches
of Christ, as I have, to the Republicks of the Cities of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>But possibly you will grant me, that Congregational Government was of Apo|stolical
Institution; but it will be a matter of too hard a Digestion to yield, there
was no other Government that was likewise so: And yet, if you cannot give me
an Apostolical Draught of any other Church-Government, nor one Instance (as
I believe you cannot) of any Church in the First Century, or till toward the end
of the Second, (if then) but what was Congregational, nor of any Officers (be|sides
the Apostles, Evangelists, and Prophets,) which were not local, and li|mited
to particular Congregations: It must then be acknowledged, that no o|ther
Government (intended for after times) but the Congregational was abso|lutely
primitive, and of Apostolical Original; say not, it might be, though not
recorded; for <HI>Eadem est ratio non apparen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">um &amp; non existentium;</HI> to us it was not,
if it appears not; perhaps but one Church in one City or Town at first; but no
Instance can be given of one Pastor over divers Cities and Towns.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="12">
The former <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">truth is so great a one, that even in the time of S. <HI>Cyprian</HI> (when
yet too many Novelties, not to say Corruptions, had invaded the Church) the
Usurpation that was then begun upon the Rights of the People, had not pre|vailed
so far, but that as the Bishop of that time was Congregational only, and
local, (to speak generally;) so he was not ordained at large, but to a certain
People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cypr. Ep. l. 1. Ep. 4.</NOTE> and Cure. Thus, saith S. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> was <HI>Sabinus</HI> ordained. The Passage
is very remarkable, and since it not only evidences the Point I have asserted, but
does also vindicate the Presbyterian way of Ordination used now, as a way that
was used at that time, to wit, by the Concurrence of preaching Ministers, <HI>Pre|positi,</HI>
or Bishops of several Congregations, and the laying on of their, or one of
their hands, for this reason I will cite it at large.</P>

<HI>Basilides.</HI></P>
<P>Those learned Men that have told us that the Christian Church was formed
after the Fashion of the Synagogues and not of the Temple, or rather the Ta|bernacle,
did certainly own a true Idea of this business: There was but one
Temple in all <HI>Iudea,</HI> as but one Church, and one High Priest, to whom the
other Priests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bact. Lex c. Rab. advoc. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Mark 5. 22. Acts 13. 15.</NOTE> as also the Levites, in severel orders, were subordinated, as well
as one to another, in a certain line of Dependance. But the Synagogues were
many, and many in one City, even some Hundreds in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and in every
Synagogue, (if all had one form) there were many Rulers: Now particular
Churches are unto the Catholick Church, the same, in proportion, that Syna|gogues
were to the Jewish.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="12">
To be sure, this is manifest to whosoever considers it, That Christ and his
Apostles did carefully avoid the Imitation and Similitude of the Tabernacle in
all their Institutions, and all their Orders: The Apostles were never called
Chief Priests, nor the Presbyters Priests, the Ministers the Clergy, nor the Peo|ple
the Laity; no National Form of Church Government was ever Established,
no Consecration of Officers; no Garments or Holy days, or other such like Ob|servances,
were ever appointed by them, in Conformity to those of the Taber|nacle.
But when the Judaizing Opinion, which prevailed mightily even in the
days of the Apostles, had, after their decease, diffused and spread it self farther,
so that Christians came into an Admiration of the Orders, Beauty and Pomp of
the Temple, which was but a fixed Tabernacle, and Christianity it self became
considered (as by some it is this day) but as another kind of Judaism, then Mini|sters
were turned into Priests, Deacons to Levites, and Ordination to Conse|cration;
the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was turned into a Sacrifice, the
Table to an Altar. The Tabernacle, Times and Seasons of <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Whitsun|tide,</HI>
became generally observed, (only with some little Bowing, and bending
of themselves to Christianity,) and the Tabernacle Maintenance in time became
insisted upon also, as well as the Tabernacle Title.</P>
<P>Thus began the Defection, which upon the Tabernacle Grounds, and by pre|tences
of some Analogy unto the Orders of that Fabrick, did afterwards grow
up to a great height in most Countries, in a National Form and Dependance, but
in none to that Perfection, as under the Papacy; which as it doth divide its Rites
and Observances (almost all) from the Tabernacle, so it can pretend to
very little Authority for them, but what conceited Analogies, and some Con|gruities
of Reason, taken from the Tabernacle Orders, and the Tabernacle
Worship, do afford unto them; but Christ and his Apostles appointed not any
National Forms, as that under the Tabernacle was. Indeed, had the Apostles
owned any Pretentions of a Design to erect a National (much more an Universal)
Hierarchy, or Form of External Government in the Church, or had they done any
thing to Occasion a Just Suspition of such a Design, it would have much obstructed
the true Design and End of their Mission, which was the planting and spreading
of Christianity. For then, Magistrates and Rulers, in their own Defence, and
for Preservation of their own Inherent Prerogatives and Rights, must have al|ways
opposed it; since the Permission of such an Authority, such a Power over
their Subjects, that would not only possess an Interest in their Consciences, but be
strengthened, as a Secular Empire, by a close Connection of all the parts of it,
and an exact Dependance and Subordination, would render their own precari|ous;
such a pretence must needs have awakened the Jealousie of Kings, as indeed
it did, when Christ but spake of a Kingdom, though Spiritual, and but in Hearts;
much more then, had it been an External and Visible Kingdom, for then, Reason
of State, would for ever oppose Christianity.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all that I have said, I doubt not but you will tell me, That
the Government of the Church is Universal, and that there is a Catholick Hierarchy;
that the Apostles were ordinary standing Officers, and that, as Apostles, they were
<PB N="20" REF="13">
the very same in the Primitive Church, that Diocesan Bishops are now; and Diocc|san
Bishops, the same now the Apostles were then; that the Apostles exercised Ju|ridiction
over the Particular Churches which they instituted; And that <HI>Timothy</HI>
and <HI>Titus,</HI> who were Bishops (not Congregational, but Diocesan Bishops) were
ordained such by S. <HI>Paul.</HI> And as you will tell me these and the like, very plau|sible
things, of Bishops; so I make no question but others will tell me as plausible
of the Council at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and of the Government of the Catholick Church by
Councils and Synods of Bishops, in Correspondence to that; That the Apostles, as
Apostles, should be Diocesan Bishops, and that Diocesan Bishops, as such, should be
Apostles, seems so strange an Assertion, and so much against the Common Sense
of most Believers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nil. l. de Papa pri|matu.</NOTE> that I would rest the Controversie on that Issue. Sure I am,
<HI>Nilus</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Thessalonica</HI> tells us expre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, <GAP DESC="foreign">. &amp;c. The Pope is
no Apostle, <HI>for the Apestles did not make or ordain Apostles, but Pastors or Teachers;</HI>
much less the Chief of the Apostles: Thus he.</P>
<P>And indeed there were but twelve Apostles originally, which number was so
stated that it gave Denomination to their Order, they were called the Twelve.
As for <HI>Paul,</HI> who also was an Apostle, and not of the Twelve, he was the
Minister of the Gentiles; and as these were a kind of Proselytes to the Jewish
Church, so he was a kind of Proselyte or super added Apostle: Himself expresses
it, <HI>That he was one born out of due season,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 18. And for the Offices of
Apostleship and Episcopacy, I have shewed in my former Letter how much they
differ.</P>
<P>'Tis true, you say, that Bishops are sometimes called Apostles, and that too
by the Fathers; but, you may remember, I acquainted you they were not stiled
so by any Fathers of the first Century, or till towards the latter end (if then) of
the Second: Else, that Bishops are sometimes called Apostles I know, and
Dr. <HI>Cave</HI> hath many Citations to that purpose, to which you have added some,
and might have added more: but the Sense in which they were called Apostles,
is that only which is of any concern to us: And certainly, notwithstanding all
that you have said to the contrary, it doth not as yet appear, that those Bishops
that were called by the Antient Fathers, Apostles, were Diocesan Bishops; for
they might be, and really, for all that glorious Denomination, they were but
Congregational Prelates, who, because in a sense they were Successors of the
Apostles, and the same, in some Proportion, unto particular Churches, that the
Apostles themselves were to the general, even for that reason they were called
Apostles, and all as well as any Diocesans.</P>
<P>That the Bishops compared to the Apostles by S. <HI>Cyprian</HI> (who is one of the
first that compares them so,) were only Presbyterical and Congregational Bishops,
is evident, in that, even there where he so compares them, he doth plainly Con|tradistinguish
them to the Deacons; for even there he mentioneth but Two
Orders, as S. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> doth; and therefore must be understood to mean
as he doth, the one of the Bishops, and <HI>Praepositi,</HI> which he compares to Apostles,
and the other of the Deacons, who, he saith, were appointed by the Apostles, as
indeed they were, <HI>Acts</HI> 6. to be their, and the Churches Servants, <HI>Meminisse au|tem

before from S. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> that his Bishop or <HI>Praepositus</HI> (for both in him are Ex|pressions
of one and the same Office) was a Preaching Minister, ordained unto
a certain People [<HI>ed eam plebem cui Praeposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us ordinatur, &amp;c.</HI>]</P>
<P>Again, that the preaching Ministers or Pastors of Congregations were consider|ed,
as in a Sense, Successors of the Apostles, and compared to them on that Ac|count,
is farther evidenced from the Testimony of <HI>Nilus,</HI> who, in his Book of the
Primacy of the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> hath these Words, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and what
then may one say? is not the Pope entirely the Successor of <HI>Peter?</HI> Yes he is, but
'tis as he is a Bishop, <Q>and is no more than what every Bishop that was ordained
by <HI>Peter</HI> may easily challenge. But there were may that by his (namely <HI>Peters</HI>)
Hand received this Grace of Episcopacy; Ay, every Priest this way is a Suc|cessor
of that Apostle, from whom, by Tradition, he received Priesthood,
and thus there are many Successors as well of <HI>Peter</HI> as of other Apostles; but in
other Respects they have no Successors.</Q></P>
<P>Thus he speaketh plainly, That Bishops and Pastours succeeded the Apostles,
but not in the Apostleship; of this there is no Succession: and Dr. <HI>Reinolds</HI> is
fully of the same Opinion, and speaks home.</P>
<P><Q>Indeed it is a Point (saith he) well worth the noting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riensid's Conf. with Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. f. 230, 231.</NOTE> that as you do noto|riously
abuse the Church of Christ (speaking to <HI>Hart</HI>) for you perswade the
Simple, and chiefly young Scholars, who trust your Common-Place Books,
that <HI>Chrysostom</HI> spake of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI>'s Successors, in the same meaning, That
the Pope doth, when he saith, That <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI>'s Suceessor is the Head of
the Church, and bindeth by solemn Oath to be obedient to the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI>
the Successor of <HI>Peter,</HI> whereas S. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> meant by <HI>Peter's</HI> Successors them
whom Christ doth put in Trust to seed his Sheep, as the Master of the Sentences
and <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Aquin</HI> do give the Name of <HI>Peters Successors</HI> to all Priests and
Prelates (as they term them) that is, to all Pastors and Doctors of the Church;
as S. <HI>Augustin</HI> teacheth, That it is said to all when it is said to <HI>Peter, Dost thou
love me? feed my sheep.</HI> As S. <HI>Ambrose</HI> writeth, That he and all Bishops have
received the Charge of the Sheep with <HI>Peter;</HI> as the Roman Clergy apply it to
the rest of the Disciples of Christ, and the Clergy of <HI>Carthage</HI> too. Thus
Dr. <HI>Reinolds.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But I stay too long on a matter that in no degree deserves it; for to inferr,
that all Bishops are properly Apostles, because they have the Name of Apostles,
is to imply, That Identity of Names, will inferr an Identy of Offices, at which
Rate <HI>Ioseph</HI> the Mittendary in <HI>Epiphanius,</HI> whom he calleth an Apostle, would
have the Honour of being a Bishop, and indeed, on that Account his Title is all
as good as Bishop Epaphroditus's.</P>
<P>'Tis true, you tell me, you believe as S. <HI>Hierome</HI> likewise did, That <HI>Epaphro|ditus</HI>
was really the Bishop, because he is called the Apostle of the Philippians,
<HI>Phi.</HI> 2. 25. But as it is true, that in the Greek it is [<GAP DESC="foreign">] your
<PB N="22" REF="14">
Apostle, so it may well be acknowledged, That our English Translators do ren|der
that Expression very well [<HI>your messenger</HI>] since nothing is more evident
than this, That the Coherence and Connexion of the Text will carry it to that
Sense. <HI>I suppose it necessary to send to you</HI> Epaphroditus <HI>my brother and companion in
labour, and fellow soldier;</HI> but, <HI>your messenger</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign">] <HI>and minster of my necessi|ties;</HI>
Which indeed he was, as appears by Chap. 4. 15, 18. <HI>Now the Philippians
know that no Church communicated with me, as concerning giving and receiving, but ye
only; I am full, having received of</HI> Epaphroditus <HI>the things (which were sent from
you,) but my God shall supply all your need,</HI> &amp;c. to wit, as you by him have supplied
mine.</P>
<P>That the Apostles exercised a Jurisdiction over particular formed Churches, and
over those particularly, which themselves had founded, is as little to your pur|pose,
if Bishops are not (which they are not) <HI>either of the Order</HI> of the Apostles,
or else <HI>Founders</HI> of Churches, as these were; as in it self it is a Truth, and not
to be questioned.</P>
<P>The Jurisdiction of the Apostles over particular Churches undergoes a Double
Consideration, in neither of which it symbolizeth with the Diocesan or Episcopal;
for it may be considered, either as it was an Appurtenance and Incident to the Office
of the Apostleship, to wit, as the Apostles were <HI>Founders</HI> of the Church Essential
and thus all the Apostles, as they had one Commission, so they had equal Au|thority,
equal Jurisdiction over all the Churches. Or it may be considered as
accruing to the Apostles from more particular Respects, to wit, as they were
the <HI>Fathers</HI> and Founders of particular Churches: The former I call Essential,
the latter Accidental Jurisdiction of the Apostles.</P>
<P>Take the Jurisdiction of the Apostles in the first Consideration, and then
Diocesan Bishops can no more pretend thereto, than they can to the Office of the
Apostleship [which was oecumeuical for its extent, as well as Infallible for its
Execution,] it being an Appurtenance and Incident only unto this, and dyed
with their Persons; Or, take it more particularly, for that Authority which
they assumed, and were understood to have, in a more particular manner, over
the Persons they had converted, and the Churches they founded, (between
which and themselves on that foot, there was a more particular Relation than
between others and them) although in this Consideration the Jurisdiction of the
Apostles was no other than what was common to them, with the Evangelists or
any other Persons that planted Christianity, made Conversions and setled Churches
in any particular Regions or Places; yet even this is as far from being Diocesan
as from being ordinary.</P>
<P>A Founder that institutes a College, settles Orders and makes Statutes, though
he doth not constitute himself (as rarely any does) a Visitor, yet, on extraor|dinary
Occasions, and in Difficulties arising about the Meaning of Statutes, or
their Application, upon incident Emergencies he would think it but a Duty, while
himself lived, and the Founded should think it theirs, to have recourse unto him
and to take his Directions; but he dying, that Authority, as being incident only
unto his Person, dyes with him; Founders, as such, have no Successors.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="14">
I touched in my former Letter on this latter Jurisdiction, in respect whereof,
in a right sense, one Apostle may well be affirmed to have had an Authority and
Power, in some places, and over some Persons, more than another; for thus, in
a particular manner, <HI>Paul</HI> was stiled the Apostle of the Uncircumcision, as <HI>Peter</HI>
was of the Circumcision.</P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>Paul, 1 Cor.</HI> 4. Expostulates with the <HI>Corinthions</HI> on this Account;
he assereth the Authority he had over them, and shews the ground of that Au|thority;
for he affirms, That as he was their Father in Christ, so he had an Au|thority
over them, as a Father over his Children, <HI>ver. 14, 15, 16. I write not
these things to shame you, but as my beloved</HI> Sons <HI>I warn you; for though you have
ten thousand</HI> Instructors <HI>in Christ, yet have you no: many</HI> Fathers; <HI>for in Christ
Iesus I have begotten you through the Gospel.</HI> Thus he claims an Authority over
them as being their Father, or one that had Converted them, which Authority
he plainly distinguishes from theirs, who were only Instructors. Now Bishops as
such, are but Instructors of Churches, not Fathers; they may Convert and
Proselite single Persons, but as Bishops they do not Found Churches, but only
Feed the Churches already founded.</P>
<P>In vertue of this Authority, as he was their Father and Founder, the Apostle
Exercised that Jurisdiction over the Church at <HI>Corinth,</HI> which you call Episcopal;
a thing so evident, that nothing can be more, to one that observes the Con|nexion:
for in the latter end of the Fourth Chapter, he evinced (as I said)
that he had a paternal Authority over them, as well as Care for them; and
immediately in the beginning of the 5th. as an Instance of that Authority, he
gives them that Direction about the Incestuous Person, upon which you
i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> sist.</P>
<P>So that in this Transaction (with the <HI>Corinthians</HI>) the Apostle acted not as
an ordinary Bishop, but acting by vertue of that Authority which he had over
them, as he was the Person that had Converted them, and was their Father and
Founder. The Quality he acted in was Extraordinary, and particular. Again,
the Cognisance he took was Extraordinary too, he was present in Spirit, and not
in Care and Affection only, [<HI>affectu et sollicitudine</HI>] as, by a supposed Parallel
in the Expression, <HI>Coloss.</HI> 2. 5. you would have me believe; for he makes his
presence the ground of his proceeding in the Censure or Judgment which he
pronounced, <HI>for I verily as absent in Body, but present in Spirit, have Iudged al|ready,</HI>
and all Judgment must proceed upon Evidence, by View, or Proof, not
Affection, and therefore his presence, which is the Ground of his proceeding,
must be a Spiritual view. The Report or general Scandal, which is mentioned
<HI>ver.</HI> 1. on which you insist, was but a Motive (to the Apostle) to invite him to
consider the matter, it was not the Ground on which he proceeded in his Cen|sure:
this, as he plainly affirms, was his Spiritual view, or presence in Spirit.
And what Spirit? but that same Spirit mentioned afterwards in the same Text;
(which Spirit you must yield to be Extraordinary, and Apostolical;) <HI>when you
come together, and Mr SPIRIT;</HI> it being but reason, that the same Spirit which
gave in Evidence, should also assist at the Execution.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="15">
But this latter Spirit (you say) was but a Letter, or Authority, conveyed by
the Apostles Letter; and why (say I) the latter Spirit not the same with the
former? and where, I pray you, is (Spirit) taken for a Letter, or for Antho|rity
conveyed by it? I am sure this same Apostle distinguishes Letter, Word,
and Spirit, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2. 2. and therefore, [and my Spirit] should not be [and

the mighty power of our Lord Jesus Christ; which, what it is, may more par|ticularly
be understood by <HI>Act. 1. 8. But you shall receive the POWER of the
Holy Ghost coming upon you.</HI></P>
<P>And the Sentence passed by S. <HI>Paul,</HI> was as Extraordinary as the Cognisance
whereon he grounded it: for [<HI>To deliver to Satan</HI>] was not to Excommuni|cate,
either with the lesser Excommunication, which is Suspension from the Sa|crament,
or with the greater, which is a solemn Excision from the Church. Some
will tell you it was a Censure wholly unknown unto the Jews, who yet had all
the Forms of Excommunication, <HI>Nidui, Cberem</HI> and <HI>Maranatha;</HI> and that in
the whole New Testament, nothing in the least is said to support this thought,
that Tradition to Satan is Excommunication. The delivery to Satan (as ma|ny
of the the Antient Fathers believed, some of whom your self do cite) was
certainly a Judiciary giving the Dilinquent to the <HI>Devil,</HI> as to a Tormentor, for so
the Apostles Phrase doth carry it, when he saith it. It was done <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<HI>for the Destruction of the Flesh;</HI> and it was practised only by the Apostles,
by their Apostolical Power, of which see <HI>Petrus Molineus</HI> in his <HI>Vates, l.</HI> 2.
<HI>c.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>You do indeed acknowledg at last, that Corporal Asfliction, or Pains inflicted
by the Devil as by a Tormentor, had Place in the first Times, and by virtue too
of Apostolical Censure; but then, by way of Qualification, you say also, That

received mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly upon your Authority, or upon the Authority of any Men, that
lived in Times remote from the first; for it requires a Proof, either from some
Text of the Holy Scriptures, or from some other Record of that same Time. It
is clear to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t. Lexis. Rab. ad voc. Nidui. Selden de jur. uat. &amp; gent. l. 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 9.</NOTE> That the <HI>Exaresis,</HI> the separation or taking away from among
them, is the only Excommunication that is mentioned by the Apostles in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.
and yet I fancy, since it answered to the Jewish <HI>Nidui</HI> which excluded not from
the Temple, it is not that which you intend. However, it is plain that this
<HI>Exeresis</HI> was not a Delivery unto Satan; for the Apostle speaks of the Sepa|ration
or taking away of the Man from among them, as of a thing they ought to
have done of themselves, without any Interposition of his, Verse 2. <HI>And you are
puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed night be taken
away from among you;</HI> to wit, according to the purport of a former Epistle v. 9.
whereas the delivery unto Satan was the Apostle's own proper Act, effected by
his Apostolical Spirit, and by the mighty Power of the Lord Jesus Christ,
verse 3, 4, 5.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="15">
Again, it is plain that this <HI>Exaresis</HI> was nothing but their Noncommunicating
and Nonconversing with the Incestuous, the Corinthians being obliged in point of
Duty, to have excluded him from their Society, so as ordinarily not to keep
him Company; for such a Direction had bin given to them by the Apostle in a
<HI>former</HI> Epistle, v. 9. as a Rule of their Deportment towards the Ungodly, which
Rule he yet found himself obliged to Explain and Qualifie in <HI>thi,</HI> as which was
only to be understood of their Demeauour towards Professou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and indeed, (un|less
they would go out of the World) practicable only towards these, and so,
not to be understood absolutely and unlimitedly, of all, verse 11. And hav|ing
touched their Remisness, verse 2. and reinscrced his Direction with its due
Limitation and Qualification verse 10, 11. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e presses them to follow it in their
Carriage towards this incestuous Person, verse 13. <HI>THEREFORE put away
from among your selves, that wicked person;</HI> THEREFORE, to wit, because I
did write unto you in a former Epistle, not to accompany with Fornicators,
which now I tell you must be understood of Professors that are such, therefore put
away from among your selves that wicked Fornicator (and so purge out the old
Leaven) by avoiding Conversation and Society with him, as much as is posfible.
The connexion sheweth, That not accompanying with this Wicked one, is the
same with purging out the Old Leaven; and not accompanying with him was their
putting him away from among themselves: Not accompanying with him was their
Judgment upon him, but the Delivery of him unto Satan was the Apostle's; no In|stance
can be given of any Persons that gave up any unto Satan but the Apostles.</P>
<P>Thus, if you please to take the Trouble of reviewing the Text, a second time,
with its intire Coherence, you cannot but observe, That it shews, that some|thing
must be done by the Apostle's own Power, and something by the People's:
in what relates unto the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s, there is first the Motive or Inducement he had
to consider the Matter, and this was the general Scandal of it, verse 1. Secondly,
The Evidence whereupon he did proceed to pass this Sentence, which was his
own Spiritual View, <HI>though he was absent in body, yet he was present in spirit</HI> (the
Antithesis must be marked) and therefore he judgeth, verse 2. Thirdly, The
Sentence which he passed, and that was, That the Criminal should be delivered
to Satan, verse 5. Fourthly, The manner how this Sentence was to be executed,
and that was, <HI>in a full congregation, in the name of Christ, with the apostolical</HI> Spirit,
<HI>and by the</HI> mighty Power <HI>of the Lord Iesus Christ,</HI> verse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. And shew me the Dio|cesan
that can do all this. What follows in the Chapter relates to the Judgment of
the People, and their putting of the Incestuous away; which (as I have shewed,
and that by the Reference and Coherence) is quite another thing than the deli|very
of him to Satan.</P>
<P>By this Time I believe it is very manifest, That Diocesan Jurisdiction cannot
be founded with any clearness of Title upon the <HI>Instance</HI> alledged, <HI>this</HI> being
plainly Apostolical, and grounded on that Authority which S. <HI>Paul</HI> had in a <HI>par|ticular
manner</HI> over the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> both as he was an Apostle, and as their
Apostle and Founder; and no Example must be pressed further than the Ground
and Reason thereof will carry it.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="16">
As for <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> who are honoured by you (as well as by other.)
with the Title of Bishops, there is fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> much said toward the unbishoping of them
by Mr. <HI>Prinne</HI> and by <HI>Smectymnuus,</HI> &amp;c. that I need say nothing; wherefore I
will only offer, that neither of them is stiled a Bishop in the Holy Scripture (for
the Epistolary <HI>Postscripts</HI> are none) when-ever it mentions the being of them at
their reputed Bishopricks; the one at <HI>Ephisus,</HI> the other at <HI>Crete.</HI> Again, <HI>Timo|thy</HI>
in effect is stiled an Evangelist by S. <HI>Paul;</HI> for when this Apostle exhorts <HI>Ti|mothy</HI>
to make a faithful Discharge of the Office committed to him, his Expression
is, <HI>do the work of an Evangelist,</HI> 2 Tim. 4. 5. And indeed as an Evangelist was
a Secondary Apostle, that is, not a settled standing Officer, fixed in any one
planted constituted Church, but an Assistant to the Apostles in planting and
settling Churches; so we find <HI>Timothy,</HI> as an Itinerant Officer, often going from
Place to Place upon occasion, as he was Invited or Imployed by <HI>Paul.</HI> The Stay
he makes even at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> was only upon the Desire of that Apostle, and not
from any Obligation arising from the Duty of his Place, as had he been a Bishop
it would certainly have been; for 1 <HI>Tim. 1. 3. Paul</HI> is said to <HI>request Timothy</HI> to
stay at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> but is not said to have ordained him Bishop there. In short, the
Tenor of the Epistle, that mentions the being of <HI>Timothy</HI> at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> as it directs
him in the Choice of Officers, and gives him Disciplinary Rules, so it sheweth
plainly, that his Business there was to perfect the Work of the Settlement of the
Church begun by <HI>Paul;</HI> and this is the more probable, because his Stay and Busi|ness
is limited to that Apostle's Return, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 3. compared with Chap. 3.
14, 15. Chap. 4. 13.</P>
<P>And for <HI>Titus,</HI> it is as evident that all his Business at <HI>Crete</HI> was that of an Evan|gelist
as that <HI>Timothy</HI>'s was so at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> for he was <HI>left</HI> at <HI>Crete</HI> (that is the
Expression) he is not said to be ordained Bishop or Metropolitan there, no more
than <HI>Timothy</HI> is said to be ordained the Bishop of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> but as the latter is af|firmed
to be <HI>requested</HI> to stay, and not to have been settled as Bishop there, fo the
former is only said to be <HI>left</HI> at <HI>Crete.</HI> And what for? but to do the Work of an
Evangelist, for so it was, to assist and help the Apostles in the Work of found|ing
and settling the Churches; <HI>for this cause left I there in</HI> Crete, <HI>that thou shouldest
set in order the things that are wanting,</HI> or left undone (to wit, by <HI>Paul) and or|dain
Elders in every City,</HI> Tit 1. 5. In the <HI>Acts of the Apostles Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI>
are said to <HI>ordain Elders in every Church,</HI> and here <HI>Titus</HI> is said to be left in <HI>Crete</HI>
to do it.</P>
<P>Indeed both <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> in what they did, the one at <HI>Ephesus</HI> the other at
<HI>Crete,</HI> were only Deputies that acted as by Delegation of S. <HI>Paul,</HI> according to
the Instructions which he gave them; for this Apostle saith to <HI>Titus, I left
thee in</HI> Crete <HI>to ordain Elders, AS I HAD APPOINTED,</HI> and sets
out the Qualifications that <HI>Titus</HI> must observe in the Elders he ordained, <HI>Tit.</HI>
1. verse 6, 7, 8 &amp;c. In like manner he instructs <HI>Timothy,</HI> how he was to behave
himself in the House of God, in settling Elders and Deacons, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> from 1, to
15. so that if Bishops be not Evangelists, as well as Apostles, I do not see of
what Advantage <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> their Business at <HI>Ephesus</HI> and at <HI>Crete</HI> can be to
your Cause.</P>

that <HI>Peter, Iohn</HI> and the other <HI>Iames</HI> might otherwise have had for that
honour.</Q></P>
<P>But however that was, I do acknowledge for my own part, that <HI>Iames</HI> was
Bishop of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> but I acknowledge it only in the sense in which he was Bishop
of all the other Churches, and he was no more in the Opinion of the first <HI>Cle|ment,</HI>
if we credit Bishop <HI>Iewell;</HI> for this Bishop in the Defence of his Apolo|gy,
Part 2. Page 98. brings in <HI>Clement</HI> speaking thus, <Q>I send greeting unto
<HI>Iames</HI> the Brother of our Lord, and the Bishop of Bishops, Governour of the
Holy Church of the Jews at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and also of <HI>all</HI> the Churches, that by
Gods Providence are every where founded; here, faith Bishop <HI>Iewell, Iames</HI> is
the Head of all Churches whatsoever.</Q></P>
<P>By this Testimony it plainly appears, that <HI>Iames</HI> the reputed Bishop of <HI>Ieru|salem,</HI>
as he was <HI>Iames</HI> the Apostle, so he was no otherwise Bishop of that
City, than as <HI>Peter</HI> was of <HI>Rome,</HI> and how that was, Dr. <HI>Reinolds</HI> has told us in
his Conference with <HI>Hart,</HI> where he saith, <Q>But whether <HI>Eusebius,</HI> or <HI>Hierom,</HI>
or <HI>Damasus,</HI> or whosoever have said that <HI>Peter</HI> was a Bishop, either they use
the name of [Bishop] generally, and so it proves not your purpose, or if
they meant it, as commonly we do, they missed the Truth: for generally a
Bishop is an Overseer, in which Signification it reaches to all who are put in
Trust with Oversight and Charge of any thing, as <HI>Eliazer</HI> is called Bishop of
the Tabernacle, and Christ the Bishop of our Souls. But in our common
use of speech it notes him to whom the oversight and charge of a parti|cular
Church is committed, such as were the Bishops of <HI>Ephesus, Philippi,</HI> and
they whom Christ calls the Angels of the Churches: Now <HI>Peter</HI> was
not Bishop after this latter sort: for he was an Apostle, and the Apostles
were sent to Preach to all the World; wherefore when the Fathers said he
was a Bishop, either they meant it in the former sense, or ought to have
meant it.</Q></P>
<P>In fine, it may not be amiss on this occasion to take notice of an Observation
made by a learned Man (and he too a Bishop) in reference to the Testimo|ny
of Fathers, to wit, <Q>That they wrote things they saw not, and so fram<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

<HI>Clement</HI> did, from the Apostolical time.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly touched the Arguments offered by you in affirmance of
Diocesan Episcopacy; only to that, which is taken from the Angels of the
Churches in the Revelation, I have said nothing, because I do not think it wor|thy
of a particular Consideration: for since these Angels, for ought we know,
might be only so many several Presidents of the Presbyteries in Congregational
Churches, the instancing of them makes but little for your purpose, who do af|firm
Diocesan Prelacy.</P>
<P>But as you have argued for Diocesan Authority, which you would have of
Apostolical Institution, so others do for the Synodical, which (as they appre|hend)
is grounded upon the Synod (so they call the Assembly) at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI>
that was convened upon the appeal made by the Believers at <HI>Antioch.</HI> For, say
they, this Controversie was absolutely and finally decided by that0 Synod, and a
Decree or Canon made, and this sent not only to the Church at <HI>Anticch,</HI> but to
all the Churches besides, of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Cilicia.</HI></P>
<P>I deny not that the former Practice was the Occasion of Synods, or Assem|blies
of Bishops; but I affirm that that Assembly, though it had something in it
of more resemblance to a Synod properly so called, than is in meer Convoca|tions,
of the Clergy, the Brethren (as well as the Apostles and Elders) being
in that Assembly, who generally are Excluded from Convocations; yet it was
not properly a Synod. A Synod properly, whether Diocesan, Provincial or
National, being but an Ecclesiastical Parliament, of the one sort, or of the other;
in which all that are obliged by the Determinations and Resolutions of it,
must be understood to be in Person, or by Representation; as either being there
themselves, or else electing those that do Compose it, to represent and stand for
them.</P>
<P>The Controversie at <HI>Antioch</HI> was about a Doctrinal Subject, of great Con|cernment,
whether Circumcision and Obedience to all the Mosaical Laws was
necessary to Salvation; for This some of <HI>Iudea</HI> taught the Brethren, and were
opposed for it by S. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas;</HI> but the Contention running high, and
neither side yielding, all agreed to send to <HI>Ierus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lem</HI> to the Apostles and Elders,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Original Deliverers of the Christian Doctrin, which being a Doctrin
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f Faith, and not of Discourse and Ratiocination, they rightly judged that it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ust be resolved at last, into the Testimony and Witness of those who had re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ived
it from Christ, and those particularly, whose Office it was to transmit it
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">to others, and to Vouch it. So that in this respect the Case is particular, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">peal was made unto the Apostles and Elders, or old Disciples, as those
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o having conversed with our Lord, had immediately received the Christian
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">trin from him; which Reason for the Appeal was Peculiar to those Persons
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">made and received it, and therefore can be none for others, taken either in
the private, or in representative Capacities.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="17">
Further, there is something else in this business that was very peculiar; I know
it is affirmed, That the Holy Ghost did assist in this Assembly in a special manner,
and that the same Assistance and Guidance is promised to all others that convene
in Christ's Name, either for the Decision of Controversies, or for Government
of the Church; and that any Synod lawfully called, and proceeding lawfully,
may say in their Decrees, as the Apostles, and Elders, and Church do hear, <HI>It
seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us.</HI></P>
<P>I acknowledge them very learned and worthy Men that think so, but I must
beg their Pardon if I differ from them; for, with Submission, I conceive that
the Phrase [<HI>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost</HI>] hath no Relation to any As|sistance
and Guidance of the Holy Ghost that was afforded by any Extraordl|nary
Illumination of Mind, to them that met on that occasion, and so it makes
nothing for Infallible Direction in Council; Rather, it relates unto the De|cision
which the Holy Ghost in Effect had already made of that Controversie, by
his Descending upon some of the Gentiles, who had believed in Christ as <HI>Peter</HI>
preached him, without any mention of <HI>Moses,</HI> or of his Law, <HI>Acts</HI> 10. from
34. to 45. For it was the Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the believing Gentiles,
who were Strangers to the Law [A Descent that was not transacted immediate|ly
by the laying on of the Hands of any Apostles, but was an Immediate De|scent,
such an one as that was which had been made before upon the Apostles
themselves on the day of <HI>Pentecost,</HI>] It was this Descent that (being a sealing
of them by the Holy Ghost, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1. 13.) was urged by the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI>
as an Argument against the Imposition of the Mosaical Yoke, which Argument
was confirmed and strengthened by <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and at last by <HI>Iames,</HI>
(who doth not give a Difinitive Sentence as the Translation carries it, and you
somewhere say, but only gives his Judgment.) And this, in fine, did carry the
matter; so that it is evident, that no Council, Synod, or Assembly of Men may
say, [<HI>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us</HI>] in their Decisions, as the
Apostles and Elders did, and because they did, if that Council, Synod, or Assem|bly
has not such a particular Manifestation of the Holy Ghost, to bottom their
Decisions, as the Apostles and Elders had; when the Apostles and Elders said
[<HI>It seemeth good to the Holy Ghost, and to us,</HI>] they meant, it seemed good
to the Holy Ghost by his Descent, and to themselves upon full De|bate.</P>
<P>But to return; The Church wilest it stood in its State of Separation from Se|cular
Government, must be considered to have been in a Double Condition; the
first while the Apostles were living, who as they had an Extraordinary Charge,
so they had a proportionable power over all the Church; the second, after the
decease or other removal of the Apostles, when the Church was left to it
self: for in these different Circumstances, the proceedings were very dif|ferent,
both as to the punishing of Offenders, and to the ending of Contro|versies.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="18">
Whilst the Apostles (who had an Extraordinary and Supernatural Rod)
were living, and in a Condition to use that Rod, as there needed no other Di|scipline
but that, to terrifie flagitious and great Offenders; so I find no other
used, and that too, but rarely; the greater Excommunication had no place,
that I can find, (unless where <HI>Diotrephes</HI> ruled) in that State of the Church:
Besides the Apostolical Rod, it was only Non conversing with, or abstaining
from the Society of Offenders, that was used as a Remedy for the Reducing of
them; and this by Apostolical Order. Indeed, the Apostles were not so much
for cutting off from the Church, as for inviting and calling Men into it: The King|dom
of Heaven is compared to a Dragnet.</P>
<P>But after the Decease or other removal of the Apostles, when the terrour of
their Rod was vanished, and when God himself did no longer (as at first he
seem'd to have done) in Extraordinary manner, particularly punish for particu|lar
Sins, as in the Case of the <HI>Corinthians, [For this cause many are sick and
weak among you,</HI> &amp;c.] and no Assistance could be had from the Sword of the
Magistrate without Scandal; in that State, necessity grew upon the Church
to make its Discipline straighter and more awful, that so, having something in it
of severe and rigorous, the Terrour (of it) might restrain, and the Execution
reform.</P>
<P>Hence came the Church-Covenant or voluntary Subjection, which (saith <HI>Lewis
du Moulin</HI>) is intimated by <HI>Pliny</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>Trajan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lud. Molin. in Paraen. c. 13.</NOTE> in his <HI>Sacramento ob|stricti;</HI>
and (says Mr. <HI>Selden</HI>) by <HI>Origen contra Celsum,</HI> when he spake of the
<GAP DESC="foreign"> of the Christians. And hence, by degrees, and as occasions obliged, it
came to pass, that Excommunications, the greater and the lesser, grew into use;
the former not so much by a positive Institution, as by the Common Law of So|ciety;
and the latter by Congruity to the Apostles Direction, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 11. Both
which though they carryed terrour in themselves, yet, to add, to it (as the
Estimate of the Privation ever doth depend upon that of the Possession) Ad|mission
into the Church, and consequently to the Lord's Table, were practised
with more Formality than in the Apostles times. Now comes in a solemn Di|stinction
of <HI>Chatechuneti</HI> and <HI>Fideles,</HI> and the Candidates of Christianity must
take time before them, must <GAP DESC="foreign">, must pass through many
Degrees before they can attain to the happiness of being admitted to a participa|tion
of the priviledges and rights of the Faithful.</P>
<P>It was now also that the Notion of a <HI>Catholick Vnity</HI> obtained, which was not
understood at that time to be <HI>Internal</HI> and Spiritual, an Unity of Faith and Cha|rity
only. But to consist in something <HI>External,</HI> relating unto Order and Disci|pline;
as being an Unity that was to be maintained by Communicatory, and o|ther
Letters, and by Orders, and (that) was intended to support the Notion of
but one <HI>Bishoprick</HI> in the Church, and that every Bishop participated of that one
Bishoprick <HI>in Solidum.</HI> A Notion, that was of great use to make their Dicipline
and Power the more pointed; for if but one Church, then to be cast out of
any part of the Church, was indeed to be ejected out of the whole; and if but one
Bishoprick to be participated by all the Bishops, what was done by one, was done
<PB N="31" REF="18">
by All; All did censure, if one did; the Expulsion made by one Bishop, out of
any Church, was in effect, an Expulsion from all the Churches; and so a cut|ting
off entirely from Christianity, and all Communion of Saints. Thus
they aimed in a General Bishoprick, at what the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> doth in
a personal; in affirming which I do not impose upon you; for S. <HI>Cyprian</HI>
is plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Cypria. ep. l. 3. ep. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Hoc <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rant utique</HI> (says he in his Tractate <HI>de simplicitate Praelatorum) &amp; caete|ri

<HI>quoque ipsum</HI> unum <HI>utque Indivisum probemus.</HI></P>
<P>Thence also came the Rails about the Table, I mean, the Differences of Com|munions,
Clerical and Laical, (to wit) to raise the Reputation and Credit of
the Clergy, and withal to make their Ceusures the more solemn and awful; as also
that the Clergy, who were obliged to a stricter and more exemplary life, if they
did not live it, might have a peculiar Punishment; which was to be thrust from
the Clerical Communion, and be degraded to that of the Laity. In fine, hence
Publick Confessions and rigorous shaming Penances in all the Decrees of them
[<HI>Fletus, Auditio, Substractio, Consistentia</HI>] had their beginning; and also solemn
Absolutions, by the Imposition of the Hands of the Bishop and of the Presbyters;
Which things, as being only Human and Politick, tho' not unnecessary for the
Time, are all of them alterable, and some actually altered.</P>
<P>Again, as Controversies arose in the Churches, either about Matters of Doctrin
or of Discipline, the Apostles, while they lived and were in a Condition (those
especially which founded such particular Churches where they arose) did take care
to end such Differences, and were accordingly repaired unto for that purpose.
Thus, in the Business of <HI>Antioch</HI> Appeal is made unto all the Apostles, and for the
<HI>Corinthians, Galatian, &amp;c.</HI> S. <HI>Paul</HI> particularly cared.</P>
<P>But after the Decease of the Apostles, or a Failure of the Apostolical Infallible
Guidance by other means, the Controversies that arose in any Church, became
determined by the Common Counsel and Advice of other Churches, either by their
Letters, or by a solemn Discussion and Debate in an Assembly of Bishops and Elders
in Provincial Councils. We do not read indeed of any Rule for this Practice; but
the Light of Nature or Common Reason directed it; and there was something too
that did lead unto it in the first Assembly at <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> For as the Apostles and
Elders were appealed unto by them of <HI>Antioch,</HI> so the whole Church was convent|ed,
and the Business considered and debated by the whole, and by the whole
resolved.</P>
<P>In sum, the Churches of Christ in this separate State subsisted by themselves, like
so many little Republicks, as being only in the World, but not of it, and there|fore
concerned not themselves in any Business with the Secular Powers: And yet
seeing their Members were Men as well as others, and in the World as well as
others, and consequently liable to Passions and Misgovernment, to Common Ac|cidents
of Providence, and to Differences too, arising in Worldly Matters, it was
absolutely necessary that some Provision should be made, in all these Respects, in the
<PB N="32" REF="19">
Church it self, by Officers on purpose, or else (since there was no other Remedy)
all would run to Confusion. Hence, as the Ancient Christians had Deacons for
the Poor, so they had <HI>Wisemen</HI> (as the Apostle calls them) or Elders, who, to
prevent the Scandal of their going to Law before the Heathen, determined Mat|ters
by way of Arbitration; and likewise restrained and suppressed exorbitant and
evil Manners, by censuring them: Out of the Church, to provide for the Poor, to
end Controversies between Man and Man, and to punish evil doing, was the Busi|ness
of the Magistrate.</P>
<P>And this reminds me of the Third State of the Church, when Magistrates and
Powers becoming Christians, the Christian Religion was taken by them into Civil
Protection, and became incorporated into the Laws, as that of <HI>Israel</HI> was into
theirs, so that now States became Churches; a State professing Christianity being
a National Church, and a National Church nothing but a Christian Nation; in a
Word, a Holy Commonwealth.</P>
<P>Great was the Alteration that was made in the Government and Face of the
Church in this Condition, from what it was before; for after the time that Em|perours
became Christian, and that they shewed Kindness to the Church, the <HI>Hie|rarchy</HI>
became a Secular thing, it being in this State, that <HI>That</HI> and the Power of
Councils attained to their full Growth; but yet, in several Countries, by several
Steps and Occasions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Loz. com. reip. Rom. l. 1. f. 141, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Lavius</HI> in his Commentary of the <HI>Roman</HI> Commonwealth,
lib. 1. <HI>fol.</HI> 22. tells us, That the Episcopal Diocesses of the Christian Religion, do,
by many very great Tokens represent the <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquity; and well he might,
for it is plain the Form of Civil Administration after the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire became
Christian (and in some degrees before,) was imitated in the Church, and that
both in the Provinces and Bounds of the Empire, and in the City it self.</P>
<P>For <HI>as</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire was divided into several Pretories, which Pretories
were called <HI>Pretorian Diocesses or Sees,</HI> and these Pretories again (were) subdi|vided
into Provinces; and that in every Pretory there was a Prefect (of the Pre|tory)
who resided in the Metropolis, called <HI>Sedes prima,</HI> to administer and rule
the Diocess; and under the Prefect, in the several <HI>Provinces,</HI> there were other
Principal Officers, called Presidents, to rule and govern <HI>them;</HI> So in the Church
there were the Metropolitan Primates, or Archbishops, who were seated in the
Metropolis or Capital Cities, and answered to the Prefects of the Pretories; and
there were Bishops that resided in the Inferious Citie, who were called Suffra|gan
Bishops, and those resembled the Presidents of the Provinces: l, and the
Parallel holds out further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ios. Scal. ep. l. 4. ep. 345.</NOTE> since a Person (as <HI>Ioseph Scaliger</HI> observes) might
be a Bishop with Archiepiscopal Ornaments, and yet not be an Archbishop, in
like manner as one might be an Officer with Consular Ornaments and yet not
be a Consul. The same <HI>Scaliger,</HI> in his Epistles, <HI>hb.</HI> 2. ep. 184. also acquaints
us, That, in the Time of <HI>Constantine the Great,</HI> there were four Prefects, of pre|tories,
the Prefect of the Pretorium of <HI>Constantionople,</HI> the <HI>Illirian</HI> Prefect, the Pre|fect
of the Pretorium of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Prefect of the Pretorium in the <HI>Gallia;</HI>
Adding, that seeing the Prefect of the Pretorium was of the same Degree that at
this Day a Vice-Roy is, he had under him <HI>Vicars,</HI> and the Vicar, he saith, was
<PB N="33" REF="19">
the Governour of a Diocess, or one that had under him a whole Diocess, and a
Diocess was a Government that contained under it several Metropolies or Capital
Cities, as a Metropolis had under it several Cities. He further adds, That the
Ecclesiastical Bishop of a Diocess, who was in the same degree with an Imperial
Vicar, was called by the Greeks a Patriarch, and among the Latines was a Pri|mate
of Primates, as the Bishop of <HI>Vienna,</HI> who had under him two Primates,
the Primate of <HI>Aquitain</HI> and the Primate of <HI>Narbona; Igitur</HI> (saith <HI>Scaliger</HI>)

And (says <HI>Barlaam,</HI> and indeed the whole Greek Church) the Deference and
Respect that was rendred to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barlaem de Papae princip. c. 5.</NOTE> by the Fathers, was so, in this re|gard
(and only in this,) because that City was the principal Seat of the Empire.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thorndick,</HI> in his Book <HI>De rat. &amp; jure fin. controv. c.</HI> 22. agrees in this Sen|timent,
and is very particular. <HI>Regiminis forma</HI> (saith he) <HI>quam in Imperium &agrave;</HI>

<HI>Worcester</HI>) when he says, in his <HI>Rational Account,</HI> part 2. ch. 5. f. 394, 395. <Q>For
our better understanding the Force and Effect of this <HI>Nicene Canon,</HI> we must cast
our Eye a little upon the Civil Disposition of the Roman Empire by <HI>Constantine,</HI>
then lately altered from the former Disposition of it under <HI>Augustus</HI> and <HI>Adrian.</HI>
He therefore distributed the Administration of the Government of the Roman
Empire under four <HI>Praefecti Praetorio,</HI> but for the more convenient Management of
it, the whole Body of the Empire was cast into several Jurisdictions, containing
many Provinces within them, which were in the Law called Diocesses, over
every one of which there was appointed a Vicarius or Lieutenant, to one of the
<HI>Praefecti Praetorio,</HI> whose Residence was in the chief City of the Diocess, where
the Pretorium was, and Justice was administred to all within that Diocess, and
thither Appeals were made; under these were those Pro-consuls or Correctores,
who ruled in the particular Provinces, and had their Residence in the Metropolis
of it, under whom were the particular Magistrates of every City: Now, ac|cording
to this Disposition of the Empire, the Western Parts of it contained in
it seven of these Diocesses, as, under the <HI>Praefectus Praetorio Galliarum,</HI> was the
Diocess of <HI>Gaul,</HI> which contained seventeen Provinces, The Diocess of <HI>Britain,</HI>
which contained five (afterwards but three, in <HI>Constantine</HI>'s Time;) the Diocess
of <HI>Spain</HI> seven. Under the <HI>Praefectus Praetorio Italiae,</HI> was the Diocess of <HI>Africa,</HI>
which had six Provinces; the Diocess of <HI>Italy,</HI> whose seat was <HI>Millain,</HI> seven;
the Diocess of <HI>Rome</HI> ten. Under the <HI>Praefectus Praetorio Illyrici,</HI> was the Diocess
of <HI>Illyricum,</HI> in which were seventeen Provinces. In the Eastern Division were
the Ciocess of <HI>Thrace,</HI> which had six Provinces, the Diocess of <HI>Pontus</HI> eleven,
and so the Diocess of <HI>Afia,</HI> the <HI>Oriental,</HI> (properly so called) wherein <HI>Antioch</HI>
was, fifteen: All which were under the <HI>Praefectus Praetorio Orientis.</HI> The <HI>Aegyp|tian</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="20">
Diocess, which had six Provinces, was under the <HI>Praefectus Augustalis;</HI> in
the time of <HI>Theodosius the elder: Illyricum</HI> was divided into two Diocesses; the
<HI>Eastern,</HI> whose Metropolis was <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> and had eleven Provinces; the
<HI>Western,</HI> whose Metropolis was <HI>Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mium,</HI> and had six Provinces According to
this Division of the Empire, we may better understand the Affairs and Govern|ment
of the Church, which was modelled much after the same way, unless where
Ancient Custom or the Emperour's Edict did cause any variation. For as the Cities
had their Bishops, so the Provinces had their Archbishops, and the Diocesses
their Primates, whose Jurisdiction extended as far as the Diocess did; and as
the <HI>Convenius Iuridici</HI> were kept in the Chief City of the Diocess for Matters of
Civil Judicature, so the Chief Ecclesiastical Councils for the Affairs of the
Church, were to be kept there too; for which there is an express Passage in the
<HI>Codex</HI> of <HI>Theodosius,</HI> whereby Care is taken that the same Course should be used in
Ecclesiastical which was in Civil Matters; so that such things which concerned
them should be heard in the Synod of the Diocess.</Q></P>
<P>This Adjustment of the Church to the Civil State in those times, might happily
be furthered by a Consideration, That even in the first and best there was some|thing
that resembled it; for what the Apostles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> are said to do
<GAP DESC="foreign">, in every Church, <HI>Titus,</HI> when he did the same, is said to do it
<GAP DESC="foreign">, in every City; as if to ordain Presbyters in every Church, and to do it
in every City, was but one thing, and that Churches, at that Time, were only
settled in Cities, and but one Church in one City; as indeed at first before the
enlarging and spreading of Christianity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Dr. <HI>Burnel</HI>'s Abridg|ment of the Hist. of the Re|formation B. l. f. 107.

<P>But whatever induced it, it is certain that Christian Emperours and Kings (par|ticularly
the famous <HI>Constantine</HI> and <HI>Charles the Great</HI>) did out of a pious Zeal in|corporate
the Church into the State, strengthen it with Laws, and accomodate
it and conform it; but yet so, that notwithstanding that Incorporation, the two
Jurisdictions were still kept too much divided; the Church had Officers of its own
linked each to other by a mutual Dependance, Courts of its own, and Councils
of its own too, as well as the State.</P>
<P>I say too much divided, for as it is true, That the Church at first did hold its
Politick Administration in some subordination unto Emperours and Kings; that
these both called and directed Councils, gave Investiture to Bishops, and at last
claimed Homage from them. And that Archbishops that received their Palls from
the Pope, did yet receive their <HI>Ferulae.</HI> (the Ensigns of their Jurisdiction) from
the Emperours: so, tho' this were something, it seems however to have been an
Errour in the first Projectors, that they made not this Subordination and Depen|dance
greater, since by this Omission Empires and Kingdoms were in a manner
put into a State of War, by setting up in them divided separate Jurisdictions.</P>
<P>I acknowledg the Errour though great, and pardonable only to the Zeal
and unexperience of the Times, remained undiscovered for a while, to wit, till
the Church had found its own Legs; but then, changing <HI>Tenure,</HI> and
claiming <HI>Iure Divim,</HI> the Hierarchy began to strike at the Heads of
those who had raised and exalted it, and then Emperours and Kings
<PB N="35" REF="20">
themselves must be bearded, and threatned too on all Occasions with the
Spiritual Sword, by Men, who, but for the Temporal, might still have lived
upon Alms. In fine, the Kingdom and Priesthood every where contended for
Superiority, and not a Government but had its <HI>Guelfs,</HI> and its <HI>Gibellines,</HI>
and then no wonder if <HI>Iure divino</HI> for the most part did carry the point, especi|ally
before the Reformation. This Error was the less Excusable, because
it was a departure from the great, and in truth, the only Example of a Holy
Kingdom, which such pious Politicians could propose to themselves, I mean,
that of the Hebrews, in which, though matters that were purely mattes of Re|ligion,
were distinguisht from matters purely Civil; the matters of God, from
the matters of the King; yet the Jurisdictions that related to them were not
Divided; the same Senate (only in distinct Capacities) as it was composed of
Fathers, as well as of Priests and Levites, so it had the Cognizance of all mat|ters;
nothing distinguished the Court in respect of the Two kinds of Causes,
Religious, and Secular, but that it had two Presidents, (which possibly were
to take the Chair as the nature of the Cause required,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Buat. Lexie. Rab. ad voc. <GAP DESC="foreign"> 2 Chron. 19. 8, &amp;c.</NOTE>) <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ziah</HI> was over
them in matters of the Lord, and <HI>Zebadiah</HI> in matters of the King, and all by an
Authority and Power derived from the King as Sovereign, and Supream in all,
<HI>Moreover in Ierusalem did Iehosaphat set,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In truth, the Church having submitted to receive Incorporation into the Civil
State, or being favoured with it, (for you may take it either way), it was no
longer obliged to continue a Divided Separate Jurisdiction;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrat. in Proem l. 5. Hist. Ecel.</NOTE> for the Reason of the
Churches separate Jurisdiction now failing, (the Magistrate being become Chri|stian,
and consequently Ayding,) the Jurisdiction that it had before must fail
with it, and so revert to the Magistrate. And Reason good it should, and that
by a reason taken even from the nature of Government; for there ought to
be, and indeed there can be, but one Spring and Fountain of Jurisdiction, in one
Kingdom and Government. Besides, Ecclesiastical Government cannot reach but
to the External Actions of Men, and therefore is very improperly called Spiri|tual,
since it is not Internal; and the External Actions of Men, as such, do pro|perly
come under the Cognisance of the Magistrate, [he being ordained to be the
Avenger of all evil doing, as well as for the praise of them that do well;] and
then nothing can remain for the Church to do, unless the same Actions must be
subjected to the Cognisance of divided unsubordinate Jurisdictions; which should
they be, would breed a great Confusion, (which I must insist upon;) and be a
great Injustice. Breed great Confusion, for that a Person in the same Cause,
should be absolved by one Jurisdiction, and be condemned by another, and this
without any means of Composure; for Example, that he should be acquitted at
the Assizes by Twelve of the Neighbourhood, and yet be Convicted in the Bishops
Court, (which may well happen where the Jurisdictions are divided, and then no
means is left neither of any Composure, if they are also unsubordinated,) this
is Confusion: As, that he should be twice Condemned, and punish'd twice for one
Fact, would be great Injustice.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="21">
As for single Congregations, they are only as so many little Fraternities,
Gilds, or Corporations, and consequently may have Constitutions and By-Laws
of their own, as these have, without the least danger or other prejudice that can
be thought of to the States that permit, or protect them.</P>
<P>Certainly the Kingdom of Christ, the true Hierarchy, is a Kingdom that is not
Secular, or of this World, that is, it is not an External but a Spiritual Kingdom, a
Power erected in the Hearts and Consciences of Men, in which he Rules and
Governs by his Word and Spirit; and therefore it doth not, it cannot as such,
pretend to any Jurisdiction (properly so called), there being no Jurisdiction (pro|perly
so called) without Coercion and Compulsion, and Coercion and Compul|sion
is a way that is not used by Christ. All the Subjects of Christ are Volunteers
and Freemen, whom as he brings into his Kingdom, so he keeps in it, only by
Perswasions, Exhortations, Counsels, and such like Methods. And this <HI>Tertullian</HI>
believed, who, in <HI>L. ad Scap.</HI> says, <HI>Humani Iuris &amp; naturalis est unicuique quod

humane nature, for every man to worship what he thinks he ought; nor does the
Religion of one, either hurt, or profit another, nor can it be any Religion to Com|pel
Religion; Religion ought to be taken up of Choice, and not by force or con|straint,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>] So far gone was that Father for Liberty of Conscience; However,
it must be confessed, That if any Persons refuse to observe the Rules of Christian So|ciety
(and particularly the Rules of that Society of which they are Members) it is
but reason that they should leave it; and if otherwise they will not, that they be
constrained to leave it: But this by the by.</P>
<P>To be sure, the Essential Church hath no one Form of External Government
assigned to it in the whole; and it was as great wisdom not to settle any in parti|cular,
for National Churches: for seeing the Church must be Extended into all
Nations, the Government and Policy of it must be of a nature either Ambula|tory,
so as to be accommodated upon Occasion, or (it must be) such an one as
without interfering with them, can consist with all the several Forms of Civil and
Secular Government. In my Judgment the Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> speaks excellently well to
this matter, when he says, <Q>I for my part do confess, That in revolving the
Scriptures, I could never find any such thing [as one Form of Discipline in all
Churches, and that imposed by necessity of a Commandment and Prescript out of
the Word of God,] but that God had left the like liberty to the Church-Go|vernment,
as he had done to the Civil Government, to be varied according to
Time, and Place, and Accidents, which nevertheless his high and Divine Pro|vidence
doth order and dispose: for all Civil Governments are restrained from
God to the several Grounds of Justice and Manners, but the Policies and Forms
of them are left free; so that Monarchies and Kingdoms, Senates and Signories,
Popular States, and Communalties are lawful, and where they are planted, ought
to be maintained inviolate. So likewise in Church matters, the substance of
Doctrin is immutable, and so are the General Rules of Government; but for
Rites and Ceremonies, and for the particular Hierarchies, Policies, and Disci|pline
<PB N="37" REF="21">
of Churches, they be left at large; and therefore it is good, we return unto
the Ancient bounds of Unity, in the Church of God, which was one Faith, one
Baptism, and not one Hierarchy, one Discipline; and that we observe the
League of Christians, as it is penned by our Saviour, which is in substance of
Doctrin, thus: He that is not with us is against us; but of things indifferent, and
of Circumstance, he that is not against us is with us.</Q> <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Considerations touch|ing
Pacification, <HI>in Resuscit. fol.</HI> 237, 238</P>
<P>This Sentiment of that Excellent Person will be much confirmed, if we consi|der
Church Policy but in one Important Instance, the calling of Bishops; for this
as it has received frequent Alteration, and been very different in different times
and Countries, so it was All upon prudential regards: In <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s time,
as in that of the Apostles, it was as it were <HI>Iussu populi, Authoritate Senatus;</HI> by
<HI>Choice</HI> of the People, and <HI>appointment</HI> of other Bishops; How it is now, All
know; and in the intermediate times it has not always been after one manner
but various, according unto various times and occasions.</P>
<P>In short, the business of Pastors and Teachers, who are permanent and standing
Officers in the Church of Christ, is to feed the Flock, by preaching and administring
the Sacraments, and, on occasion, to denounce Eternal Torments (the true
Spiritual Censure;) And this will be their business to the Worlds end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; But for
External Rule and Jurisdiction, this being but accidental to their Office, and
arising only from the particular Circumstance in which the Church was, while
separate from the State, now that the Magistrate is Christian, it doth en|tirely
devolve upon him; the Christian Magistrate is the Ruling Presbyter, and
whom he appoints as Overseers of the Poor, may be called the Deacons.</P>
<P>It is certain, that in our English Constitution, (not to speak of the French,
and that of other Foreign Kingdoms,) however some may talk of <HI>Iure divino,</HI> all
Government or Jurisdiction, the Spiritual (as they call it,) as well as the Tem|poral,
is derived from the King; who, in this sense, is supream Ordinary, Bishop,
and Governour, in all Causes, and therefore in all Courts and Jurisdictions. This
is evident both as to the Legislative part of the Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nath. Ba|con, Histor. Disccurs. Part. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 1.</NOTE> and to the strictly
Jurisdictive; for, as my Author tells me, out of the British Councils, All the
Church Laws in the time of the Saxons were made in the <HI>Micklemote:</HI> And in|deed
it were easie to evince, that most of the Ancient Synods and Councils in
<HI>England,</HI> as well as in other Countries, were meer Parliaments. As for the Con|sistory
Court, which every Archbishop and the Bishop of the Diocess hath, as
holden before his Chancellor or Commissary, this seems not to have been divided
from the Hundred or County Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Dug|dale</HI>'s An|tiquities of <HI>Warwick+shire</HI> in the Preface.</NOTE> before a Mandate was given to that purpose by
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, the Exemplification of which Mandate is in Mr. <HI>Dugdale,</HI>

But to set out the matter by more Authentick Records; In the Statute of
Provisors it is affirmed, <Q>That the Church of <HI>England</HI> was founded in the State
of Prelacy by <HI>Edward</HI> the First, (Grand-father to <HI>Edward</HI> the Third) and his
Progenitors.</Q> And in <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, Chap. 19. in the Submission of
the Clergy, <HI>these acknowledge,</HI> (as they say) <HI>according to Truth,</HI> <Q>That the
Convocation of the same Clergy is, always hath been, and ought to be Assem|bled,
only by the King's Writ, <HI>and farther promise in Verbo Sacerdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">is,</HI> that they
will never from henceforth presume to attempt, alledge, claim or put in ure,
enact, promulge, or exact any new Canons, Constitutions, Ordinances, Pro|vincial,
or other, or by whatsoever name they shall be called in the Convocation,
unless the King's most Royal Assent and Licence may to them be had, to make,
promulge, and exact the same, and that his Majesty do give his most Royal Assent
and Authority in that behalf. <HI>And it was then enacted,</HI> That the King should at
his pleasure assign and nominate 32 Persons of his Subjects, whereof 16. to be
of the Clergy, and 16 of the Temporality, of the upper and lower House of
Parliament, who should have Power and Authority to view, search and examine
the Canons, Constitutions and Ordinances Provincial and Synodal heretofore
made, and with his Majesty's Assent under his Great Seal, to continue such as they
judge worthy to be kept, and to abolish, and abrogate the residue, which they
shall Judge and Deem worthy to be abolished. <HI>It was also provided in the same
Act,</HI> That no Canons, Constitutions, or Ordinances shall be made or put in
Execution within this Realm by Authority of the Convocation of the Clergy,
which shall be contrary to the King's Prerogative Royal, or to the Customs,
Laws or Statutes of this Realm;</Q> [there the Ecclesiastical Legislation is subject|ed
to the King.] <HI>And enacted,</HI> <Q>That it shall be lawful for any Party grieved in
any of the Courts of the Archbishops of this Realm to appeal to the King's Maje|sty
in the Court of Chancery, upon which Appeal a Commission is to be directed
under the Great Seal, to Persons named by the King, his Heirs or Successors, which
Commissioners have full power to hear, and finally determine upon such Appeal;</Q>
[And here the Jurisdiction of the Church is acknowledged to be originally in the
King, and derived from him; for there the Sovereign Supream Power lodges, where
the last appeal, the last Resort is.]</P>
<P>Add, that in the first Year of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. in an Act entituled An Act for Electi|on
of Bishops, <HI>it was enacted,</HI> <Q>That none but the King by his Letters Patents shall
collate to any Archbishoprick, or Bishoprick. <HI>It was also declared,</HI> That the use
of Archbishops, and Bishops, and other Spiritual Persons to make, and send out
Summons in their own names, was contrary to the form, and order of the Sum|mons
and Process of the Common Law used in this Realm, seeing that All Au|thority
of Jurisdiction, Spiritual and Temporal, is derived, and deducted from
the King's Majesty, as Supream Head of these Churches and Realms of <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and so Justly acknowledged by the Clergy of the said Realms.</Q>
<HI>It was therefore enacted,</HI> <Q>That all Courts Ecclesiastical, within the said Two
Realms, be kept by no other Power or Authority either Foreign, or within this
Realm, but by the Authority of the King's Majesty, and that all Summons and

it seems plain that that of the first Year of <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth is revived: But sup|posing
it is not; yet, in that case, though, the Constitutive part remain void, the
<HI>Declarative</HI> will still stand good, as shewing the Common Law. Nor doth the

so that National Churches are all of Human Institution, and their Go|vernment
Ambulatory, that is, Alterable according as Times and Occasions, and
as the Forms of Civil Governments in States, that do incorporate the Church,

<HEAD>THE THIRD
LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have always acknowledged some Episcopacy to be of Primitive Antiquity;
but you will please to remember, I have likewise shewed, that that Episco
pacy was Presbyterial not Prelatical; Congregational not Diocesan; And
that the Primitive Bishop was only a first Presbyter, that is, a Chairman in
the College of Presbyters, and not (as in the Diocesan Hierarchy,) a Prelate
of a superior Order that presided over several Congregational Churches, and was
invested with the Power of sole Ordination and Jurisdiction; much less was
he an Officer that kept Courts, that had under him Chancellours, Commissaries,
Officials, Registers, Apparitors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that judged [<HI>per se aut per alium</HI>] in
certain reserved Cases.</P>
<P>To make this out, I presented to you a Scheme of the Government of the Church,
both as it was established and settled by the Apostles, and as it was afterwards:
I shewed, That the Apostles in all their Institutions did carefully avoid any Imi|tation
of the Temple-Orders, to which Orders the Prelatical Hierarchy doth plain|ly
conform. I shewed also, That the Government settled by the Apostles was
only Congregational, the Apostles in planting of Churches proceeding only after
the Model and Way of the Synagogues. Ay! all the Churches that we read of
in Scripture, that were constituted by the Apostles, were only Congregational,
not National or Provincial; that is, they were as so many little Republicks, each
consisting of a Senate or Eldership, with the Authority, and of a People with
the Power; but all independant one of another, and all possessed of all that Juris|diction
and Authority over their Members, that was to be standing and ordinary.
For this Reason, tho' every Congregation was but a part, and a small one, yet it
had the Denomination of the whole, every particular Congregation was stiled a
<HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>This will appear more evident, if we consider, That the Interest of the People
<PB N="41" REF="23">
had at first, and long after, (for above 150 Years) in the Ordination of Officers,
was very great. It is true, the Word [<HI>Ordination</HI>] or that which answers to it
in the <HI>Greek,</HI> is never used throughout the whole <HI>New Testament,</HI> for the making
of Evangelical Officers, nor did it, in this Sense, come into use among Christians
till after the Christian Church began to accommodate to the Language, as well as
to the Orders of the Jewish. But then, as the People was called <HI>Laity</HI> and <HI>Plebs,</HI>
so the Clergy was called <HI>Ordo,</HI> and this in the same Sense of the Word, as when
we read of the Order of <HI>Aaron,</HI> and of that of <HI>Melchisedeck;</HI> and then too, the cal|ling
of any Person to the Ministry, as it was a calling of him to be of the Clergy
or Order, so it was stiled an Ordination, Ordination being nothing but the plac|ing
of a Person in the Order of the Clergy.</P>
<P>But tho' the Word [<HI>Ordination</HI>] was not as yet in use, in the first Times, the
Thing was, which is the Creation of Officers in the Church; and in this the People
possess'd so great a share (which is a very good Argument of the Church's being fram|ed
at first after the Model and Way of Republicks) that even the Action it self is
called <HI>Chirotonia</HI> by S. <HI>Luke</HI> in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,,</HI> and ever since by the
<HI>Greek Fath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.</HI> Ay, the Creation of Officers is not usually called <HI>Chirothesia;</HI>
for <HI>this</HI> with the Greek Fathers was the Word that was mostly, if not always, used
for Confirmation, not for Ordination, tho' Imposition of Hands, the Cere|mony
signified by that Word, was the Rite which was used by the Jews in creat|ing
of Rabbies and Doctors: the Act of <HI>Ordination</HI> is usually, if not always deno|minated
<HI>Chirotonia,</HI> or Extension of Hands, which, in the Greek Republicks, was
the Name or Word for the Popular Suffrage.</P>
<P>Indeed <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> are said to <HI>Chirotonize,</HI> or, as our Translators ren|der
the Word, <HI>Acts 14. 23. To ordain them Elders in every Church.</HI> But (says
Mr. <HI>Harrington</HI>) they are said to do so, but in the same Sense that the <HI>Proedri,</HI> who
were Magistrates, to whom it belonged to put the Question in the Representative
of the People of <HI>Athens,</HI> are, in <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> said <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vb. Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. in descr. reip. Athen. Plut. in vit. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oc.</NOTE> to make
the Suffrage; and the <HI>Thesmothetae,</HI> who were Presidents in the Creation of Ma|gistrates,
are in <HI>Pollux</HI> said <GAP DESC="foreign">, to chirotonize the <HI>Strategi,</HI>
who yet, ever since the Institution of <HI>Cliethenes,</HI> that distributed the People into
ten Tribes, were always used to be elected and made by the Popular Suffrage.</P>
<P>Nor was this manner of Speaking peculiar unto the Greeks, but, as <HI>Calvin,</HI> in his
Institutions <HI>l. 4. c. 4. f.</HI> 15. observes, it was a common Form used also by the Ro|man
Historians, who say, That the Consul created Officers, when he only pre|sided
at the Election, and gathered the Votes [of the People.] <HI>Et c'est uniforme
commune de parler: comme les Historiens disent quun Consul creoit des Officiers, quand
il recevoit le voix du peuple, &amp; presedoit sur l' election.</HI></P>
<P>So plain it is that S. <HI>Luke,</HI> in saying that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> did <HI>chirotonize</HI> the
Elders, intended to signifie no more, but that the Elders were made by the Suf|frage
of the People, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> presiding at the Election, and declaring
or making the <HI>Crisis:</HI> and so the New Latin Translation in <HI>Beza</HI> and <HI>Piscator</HI>
renders the Text,, <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mque ipsis per suffragia creassent,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I know that some have told us, That <HI>Iosephus</HI> uses the Word with reference
<PB N="42" REF="24">
unto God, he saying, that <HI>God did chrirotonize Aaron thrice,</HI> and therefore to chi|rotonize
is not always to be taken for the Popular Suffrage; Nor is chirotonizing
always taken so. But supposing that the Word [<HI>Chirotonize</HI>] was used by <HI>Iose|phus,</HI>
as afterwards it came to be by others, in a second Sense, for any Creation of
Officers in general, yet in the primary and proper use it signifies the Popular Suf|frage;
for <HI>Chirotonia</HI> in <HI>Suidas</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Election, Ratification made
by All.</HI> And this also was the common Use of the Word at that time when, and in
the Places (most of them Republicks) where the Apostles are said to chirotonize:
And certainly no Man can imagine with Reason, That the making of Elders in its
first Institution should be called <HI>Chirotonia,</HI> and bear the Name of the Suffrage of
the People, especially in that time, and in such places, had these Elders been made
in any other manner than by the popular Suffrage; for then the name of the Action
would have been distinctive or proper, as all Original Names of things are used to be.</P>
<P>Besides, what if it should be said, (as indeed it is by Mr. <HI>Harrington</HI>) that when
the Congregation or People of <HI>Israel,</HI> upon the several miraculous Appearances in
favour of <HI>Aaron,</HI> did recognize him again and again for High Priest, this <HI>Chiroto|nia</HI>
of the People was the <HI>Chirotonia</HI> of God? Why might not God as President of
the Congregation in that Theocracy, as well be said (as he is by <HI>Iosephus</HI>) to
chirotonize when the People did, as the <HI>Proedri</HI> who presided in the Assembly of
the People at <HI>Athens,</HI> be said, by <HI>Demosthenes</HI> to make the <HI>Diachirotonia;</HI> the
<HI>Thesmothetae</HI> by <HI>Pollux,</HI> to <HI>Chirotonize</HI> the <HI>Strategi;</HI> and the Consul who presided at
the Election of Officers at <HI>Rome,</HI> be said by the Roman Historians, to create these
Officers?</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Diachirotonia,</HI> tho' you think it the Act only of the Magistrates, not
of the People, because <HI>Hesychius</HI> says, <GAP DESC="foreign">,
you will give me leave to acquaint you, that the <HI>Diachirotonia</HI> was as much
the Act of the People, or of those suffrage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, as the <HI>Chirotonia</HI> it self (was.) For
those that suffraged or made the <HI>Chirotonia,</HI> are said, in cases of competition, to
<HI>Diachirotanize,</HI> because then, by their Suffrages, they did distinguish one of the
Competitors from the other, and he of the Competitors that was distinguished to
his Advantage, as carrying the Office by most Voices, was said to be <HI>Diachiroto|nized;</HI>
and a Declaration was made, That he was elected, which Declaration was
called <HI>Crisis.</HI> All this is evident from <HI>Plato,</HI> who treating (<HI>l. 6. de leg.</HI>) concern|ing
the Election of the <HI>Strategi,</HI> in case of Competition, says, <GAP DESC="foreign">.
<HI>whoever appears to be Diachiroto|nized,</HI>
[or to have most Voices] <HI>be it declared</HI> [let the <HI>Crisis</HI> be] <HI>that he is elected.</HI>
Here he distinguishes very plainly between the <HI>Diachirotonia,</HI> which he attributes
to those that suffraged, and the <HI>Crisis</HI> or declarative Judgment, which was the Act
of those that <HI>presided:</HI> But he does it afterward more plainly, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> ordaining that
the same Rule that was observed in the making of the <HI>Strategi,</HI> should be also ob|served
in that of the <HI>Taxiarchi,</HI> he says, <HI>Let the same be observed both as to the</HI> Epi|chirotonia
<HI>and the</HI> Crisis; that is, as to the Suffrage and to the Resolve: So that
<HI>Hesychius</HI> his <GAP DESC="foreign">, must be interpreted a Discrimination, or pre|ference
made by Suffrage.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="24">
As for the Jurisdiction of the Apostles, I make no doubt but that the Apostles,
who were <HI>Elders</HI> as well as Apostles, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 1. acted in setled Congregations,
where any of them happen'd to be or to reside, with the Elders of such Congrega|tions,
in that Capacity of Elders; but as this Authority was not properly or pure|ly
Apostolical, so that which was, both that I call the Essential, that was inci|dent
to the Apostles, as they founded the Church, and the Accidental, that was
incident to them, as they founded particular Churches, was Extraordinany and
peculiar, as being only for that emergent Occasion, and not for Continuance. To
speak generally, governing the Churches was as much an ordinary Work as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">reach|ing,
and was common to all the Elders, whether Apostles or not; but to do it in
such a particular manner, with such a Rod, and with so large a Superintendence,
as, in some cases, the Apostles did, was extraordinary and peculiar to them. No
Officers that are now can pretend to a Rod like that of the Apostles, <HI>Acts</HI> 5. 3, 4,
5, <HI>&amp;c. 1 Cor.</HI> 4. 21: and therefore none that are now can exercise such a Discipline
as they did. Those that will truly evidence that the Prelatical Hierarchy is Apo|stolical,
ought to demonstrate, that besides the Officers setled in all particular
Churches, to feed and govern them, the Apostles and Evangelists setled others,
as a kind of Visitors General, over all, or over many Churches together, with
the same Authority that themselves had exercised, and this for continuance; with|out
this nothing is done to any purpose.</P>
<P>As for the Transaction 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. I am still of the mind it was wholly extraor|dinary,
and that it cannot be drawn into Example. The Apostle says, <HI>When you
are gathered together, and my Spirit,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, [not with the Authority, but]
<HI>with the</HI> (mighty) <HI>power of the Lord Christ,</HI> [to the end] <HI>to deliver such an one
unto Satan.</HI> Whence it follows very clearly, That without the Apostles Spirit,
and the mighty Power of Christ, the Corinthians were unable to deliver that In|cestuous
to Satan; for else I see no Reason why they should have the <HI>Conjunction</HI>
and Assistance of these, [the Apostles <HI>Spirit</HI> and Christ's <HI>Power</HI>] for that end,
since then there would be no need of <HI>it.</HI> And if they could not deliver the Incestu|ous
to Satan without the Assistance of the Apostolical Spirit, and the mighty Pow|er
of Christ, it also follows, that to deliver to Satan, was not meerly to excom|municate,
eject or suspend him, since this was so much in their own Power, that
they might have done it of themselves, without such Extraordinary and Miraculous
Aids. To be sure, this Effect, whatever it was, if it bore (as every Effect must
do) proportion unto its cause, it must be something that was Extraordinary; for
it came not only from the Spirit of the Apostle, but also from the Miraculous Power
of Christ, for such a Power that is, which <GAP DESC="foreign"> signifies, as is evident, <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 8.</P>
<P>'Tis true, you infer from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 2. That the Corinthians could not put away
the Incestuous without a new Commission from the Apostle, who was their Bishop,
and consequently you understand the Power was given to them, only of a Com|mission
or Authority. But on the contrary, the Word used for Power is (as I
have said before) <GAP DESC="foreign"> (not <GAP DESC="foreign">,) a Word that commonly signifies
Strength, not Authority. Besides, if this putting away v. 2. must be understood
(as certainly it must) of the same putting away with that v. 13. nothing can be
<PB N="44" REF="25">
plainer than that it was a Censure the People could and ought to have made of
themselves, without expecting any new Commission; as being in a matter that by
the Apostles own Concession, they had a proper Cognisance of, and over a Person
too, whose competent Judges they were; as the same Apostle tells them, <HI>Do not
you judge them that are within, therefore put away,</HI> &amp;c. putting away is grounded on
the Peoples Judgment, but delivery unto Satan upon the Apostles. And yet
however putting away may well be called an <GAP DESC="foreign"> or Rebuke, and be a kind of
Punishment; for to be excluded from the Common Society and Conversation of the
Faithful, cannot deserve a milder Expression.</P>
<P>You still insist, That there is and ought to be a Disparity of Ministers, because
there was a Disparity between the 12 Apostles and the 70 Disciples, and with
<HI>Blondel</HI> think, that the 70 continued in the same Office after the Ascension of our
Lord, that they had before; for you say, <Q>You cannot believe they withdrew their
Hands from the Plow, or that our Saviour deposed them from their Office, or de|pressed
them into the Rank of private Men.</Q> But tho' you do not believe (as I
know no need you should) that the 70 withdrew their Hands from the Plow, or
that our Saviour deposed them from their Office, or depressed them into the Rank
of private Men, yet, if their Office was only occasional, that is, if they were sent
by our Saviour to the House of <HI>Israel,</HI> as Messengers upon some particular Occasi|ons,
and about a particular Business; then their Office ceased of Course at their
Return, like that of a Prince's Envoy, whose Office ends with his Business, that
is, as soon as his Message is done, and he returned with the Account of it. I
know of no Jurisdiction the 12 Apostles had over the 70, but am sure, the Office
and Work of the 70 (whatever it was) related but to the Jews, as being a Bu|siness
only for that Time, a Time that was the <HI>Crepusculum</HI> or Twi-light between
the Law and Gospel, Judaism and Christianity, while as yet the Kingdom of Heaven
was only at hand, but not come, <HI>Luke</HI> 10. 9. I add, That the Office of the 70 is
not reckoned in the number of the Ascension Gifts, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 11. And, which is
more, that the Apostles themselves, had they not received another, a new Com|mission
after the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urrection of Christ, they, by their former old one (which
confirmed them unto <HI>Iudaea,</HI> as that of the 70 also did them, and which was only
for a preliminary Work, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10. 7. as that of the 70 also was,) could not
have had an Authority to preach the Gospel unto the Gentiles, and so to lay the
Foundation of the Catholick Church And therefore the first Commission as it was
limited, so it was Temporary, and expired (at furthest) when a second was given
them, <HI>Matth. 28, 18, 19. Acts</HI> 1. 8. Not but that the 70 as well as the 12 had
Business in the Kingdom of Heaven, or the Evangelical State; but they had it not
under the Denomination of the 70, or in vertue of their first Commission or Mission,
but only as they came to be Officers in this Kingdom, by being constituted Evan|gelists,
or Prophets, or Pastors and Teachers, or Deacons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>You offer again in Confirmation of your Notion of the Apostleship of Bishops,
that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and the Angels of the Churches in the <HI>Revelation</HI> were
Bishops, constituted by the Apostles with the same Authority themselves had;
and that the Twelve Apostles and <HI>Paul</HI> were not all the Apostles that the Scripture
<PB N="45" REF="25">
speaks of, for <HI>Barnabas</HI> and others were Apostles too as well as they.] I ac|knowledge
<HI>Barnabas</HI> to be an Apostle, but I cannot acknowledge that he was an
Apostle of the same Rank with the Twelve, and <HI>Paul;</HI> for as <HI>Paul</HI> himself distin|guishes,
<HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 1. All Apostles were not of the same Rank, but some were in
the first, some in the second Order; that is, some were Apostles sent immediately
by Christ himself, and so were Legates <HI>&agrave; latere,</HI> and some were sent, not imme|diately
by Christ himself, but by Men. Now <HI>Paul</HI> insists, That himself was an
Apostle of the first Order, and in the same Rank with the Twelve, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 17.
whereas it is plain, that <HI>Barnabas</HI> and all the others who are called Apostles, can
pretend to be but of the second; they being sent, not immediately by Christ him|self,
as those of the first were, but only by Man; either by the Apostles that were
of the first Order, as <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> by <HI>Paul,</HI> or by some Church, as <HI>Barnabas,
Acts</HI> 11. 22. for here the Church is said to send forth <HI>Barnabas as their Apostle;</HI>
and not barely to <HI>dismiss</HI> him, as the word Imports that is used, <HI>Acts</HI> 13 3.</P>
<P>Apostles of the second Order are called also Evangelists, and it was their busi|ness
to be Assistant unto those of the first, if not always to their Persons, yet, at
least, to their Work, which was to plant Churches, by making of Conversions,
and setling Orders: And of this sort of Apostles I again acknowledge <HI>Timothy</HI> and
<HI>Titus</HI> to have been.</P>
<P>I proved in my former Paper, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were Evangilists; but it
seems, the Argument I used loses all its force with you, because its strength, like
that of the Arch-work, lies in the Combination and Concurrence, and you con|sider
it only in pieces; not as a whole, and all its parts together and United, but
only separately, and part by part.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Timothy,</HI> methinks we do too often find him with <HI>S. Paul</HI> in his Perambu|lations,
to have any reason to conceive that he was resident Bishop of <HI>Ephesus;</HI>
and for <HI>Titus,</HI> his Diocess seems too large for any ordinary Bishop. <HI>Crete</HI> is famed
to have had an hundred Cities in <HI>old</HI> time, and <HI>Pliny</HI> assures us, (<HI>L. 4. c.</HI> 12.)
that in <HI>his</HI> there were forty, which were enough for so many Bishopricks. <HI>Titus</HI> had it
in Charge, <HI>Tit. 1. 5. to ordain Elders in every City,</HI> and to ordain Elders in every
City, was to settle a Church in every City; so that if every Church must have a
Bishop (as some are confident it must,) then every City in <HI>Crete</HI> that had a
Church, had also a Bishop, and so possibly there were as many Bishops and Bisho|pricks
in <HI>Crete,</HI> as there were Cities. This Consideration, if well weighed,
will much abate of the Authority of the Postscript of the Epistle to <HI>Titus,</HI> in
which this Evangelist is stiled the Ordained Bishop in the Church of the <HI>Cretians;</HI>
for according to the Language of that time, had <HI>Titus</HI> been indeed the Bishop of
that whole Island, he ought to have been stiled Bishop of the Churches (and not
of the Church) of the <HI>Cretians.</HI> But it seems it is taken for granted, that a Bi|shop
must have but one Church, and therefore, that <HI>Titus</HI> may be a Bishop of the
<HI>Cretians,</HI> all the Churches of <HI>Crete</HI> must be Consolitated into one; else among
all the Churches in <HI>Crete,</HI> I would fain know, which was the Church of
the <HI>Cretians,</HI> where <HI>Titus</HI> resided. If <HI>Titus</HI> was Bishop over all the Churches in
<HI>Crete,</HI> he was a Bishop of Bishops, and at least a Metropolitan, which indeed
would be most in favour of the Hierarchy, could it be Evidenced. But this could
<PB N="46" REF="26">
not be the settlement that was made in <HI>Crete.</HI> For it would be strange, that the
Apostle should appoint a Hierarchy in <HI>Crete,</HI> that should differ from the form of
Government setled upon the Continent by himself and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> who constituted
Elders in every Church, without appointing (that we read) of any Superiour
Bishop or Metropolitan that should have a General Care and Inspection over the
several Churches. For my part, I could not see how <HI>Titus</HI> should understand his
Commission, which was to ordain Elders in every City, to carry any other Inten|tion
with reference to <HI>Crete,</HI> than the very same words do, when they are used
to signifie what <HI>Paul</HI> himself, who gave him this Commission, had done upon the
Continent, where he and <HI>Barnabas</HI> ordained Elders in every Church. And there|fore
as <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> established single Congregations only, and Organized
them with Elders, and then left them to govern themselves by their own Intrin|sick
powers; So in the like manner, <HI>Titus</HI> established Churches in every City, and
Organized them with Elders, which having done, it is very probable that he re|turned
again unto S. <HI>Paul,</HI> to give an account of his Commission. Thus <HI>Titus</HI> his
business in <HI>Crete,</HI> has the very Idea and Signature of that of an Evangelist, or a
Secundary Apostle, without the least Mark of an ordinary Bishop; nor is there
any hint in all the Authentick Scriptures, of his being ordained Bishop of <HI>Crete,</HI>
or indeed of any place else. And the like must be said of <HI>Timothy,</HI> with refer|ence
to <HI>Ephesus,</HI> who was sent to the Church there as a Visitor only, with Apo|stolical
Authority, and so as S. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Delegate. Nor it <HI>Titus</HI> his ordaining of
Elders, a good Argument for sole Ordination; for the word, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 5. is the
same that is used in <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 3. in the matter of the Deacons, who were appointed
by the Apostles (not one of the Apostles, but all) and chosen by the People.
And one might well admire that the same word which is Translated [appointed]
in one place, should be rendred [ordained] in another, but that <HI>Titus</HI> is said to
ordain, and not to appoint only, that it might look as if there were a plain Text
for sole Ordination.</P>
<P>But what if <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> had a power of sole Jurisdiction? and a power
too of making Canons, for the Government of the Church? (which latter yet
is an Authority that every Bishop will not pretend unto, after their Example.)
The Church then, was in a State of Separation from Secular Government, and
among Heathen, just as the Jews are now, among Christians; so that all it could
do at that time, was to perswade; it could not compel: And therefore it will
not follow now that the Church is protected, and not only protected by, but In|corporated
into, the State, that the Officers of it must have the same powers, and
Exercise them in the same manner, as before, or (as Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> expresses it)
<Q>That <HI>England</HI> must be Governed as <HI>Ephesus</HI> or <HI>Crete.</HI></Q> It is certain that Kings
would gain but little by the Bargain, not to say, they must depart with their So|vereignty
to Incorporate the Christian Religion, should this be admitted, that
Church-Authority, Church-Power must be still the same after such Incorporation,
as before. For a separate National Jurisdiction Exercised by one or many, is
a Solecism in State, especially if it claim by the Title of <HI>Iure divino,</HI> a Title that
renders it Independent upon, as well as unboundable and uncontroulable by all
that is human. Such a Jurisdiction would weaken that of Kings; and other States.
<PB N="47" REF="26">
All their Subjects would be but half Subjects, and many none at all; and it is no
more nor less but that very same thing, that heretofore was found so inconvenient
and burden some under the Papacy, and that made the best and wisest, and greatest
of our Kings so uneasie. A Clergy imbodied within it self, and independent on
the State, is in a Condition of being made a powerful Faction upon any Occasion,
and easie to be practised upon, as being united under one, or a few Heads, who
can presently convey the Malignity to all their Subordinates, and these to the
People. So that I lay it down as a Maxim, that nothing can be of greater danger
to any Government than a National Hierarchy, that does not depend upon it, or
is not in the Measures and Interests of it. Fresh Experience has learned us this.</P>
<P>I know not with what Design it was said by <HI>Padre Paulo Sarpio</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> but
his Words are very remarkable, as I find them cited from an Epistle of his to a
Counsellor of <HI>Paris,</HI> in the Year 1609. [<Q>I am afraid (says he) in the behalf
of the English, of that great power of Bishops, though under a King. I have
it in Suspicion when they shall meet with a King of that goodness, as they will
think it easie to work upon him, or shall have any Archbishop of an high Spirit,
the Royal Authority shall be wounded, and Bishops will aspire to an Absolute
Domination. Methinks I see a Horse Sadled in <HI>England,</HI> and I guess that the
old Rider will get on his Back: But all these things depend on the Divine Provi|dence.</Q>]
Thus he, very prudently as to the main, though perhaps with some
mistake as to his Conjecture.</P>
<P>For my part, I think it but reason that such Persons as have the Benefit of Hu|man
Laws, should in so much be guided by them; and that the Sword which owns
no other Edge but what the Magistrate gives it, should not be used but by his Di|rection;
As indeed the practice in <HI>England</HI> has always been. For as Mr. <HI>Selden</HI>
observes, <Q>Whatever Bishops do otherwise than the Law permits, <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI>
can controul, or send them to absolve, <HI>&amp;c. He also says very well,</HI>
That nothing has lost the Pope so much in his Supremacy, as not acknowledging
what Princes gave him; 'tis a scorn (<HI>says he</HI>) on the Civil Power, and an un|thankfulness
in the Priest. But, <HI>adds he,</HI> the Church runs to <HI>Iure divino,</HI> lest if
these should acknowledge what they have by positive Laws, it might be as well
taken from them, as given to them.]</Q> Ay, <HI>This excellent Person goes further, so
much further as to tell us,</HI> <Q>That a Bishop, as a Bishop had never any Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction [in <HI>England</HI>]; for as soon as he was <HI>Electus Confirmatus,</HI> that is, af|ter
the Three Proclamations in <HI>Bow-Church,</HI> he might Exercise Jurisdiction be|fore
he was Consecrated, and yet till then [that he was Consecrated] he was
no Bishop, neither could he give Orders. Besides, <HI>says he,</HI> Suffragans were Bi|shops,
and they never claimed any Jurisdiction.]</Q></P>
<P>As for the Angels in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> I see no Evidence in what is said (tho' much
is said) to prove them to have been Diocesans. It will not follow they were
single persons, because they are called <GAP DESC="foreign"> not <GAP DESC="foreign">, as who would say they
are compared to Stars, and not to Constellations; for the Truth is, both these
Words are used promiscuously, as well for the Constellations as for the single Stars,
so that no stress is to be laid upon the Word that is used, for either side. Besides,
some are of the Opinion, That to the making of it clear that these Angels were
<PB N="48" REF="27">
only single Persons, and for that cause compared but to single Stars, and not to
Constellations, sufficient Reason ought to be given why the Holy Ghost, who
expresly limits the Number of the Churches, doth not in like manner limit the
Number of the Angels belonging to them: For, say they, when the Holy Ghost
said, <HI>The seven Candlesticks are the seven Churches,</HI> had he intended to signifie that
the Angels were but seven, as the Churches were, he would in like manner have
said, <HI>the seven Stars are the seven Angels of those seven Churches.</HI> But as I am not
satisfied that any great Stress should be laid, in things of Moment, upon such Criti|cal
Nicities, so, should I yield, without granting that these Angels were Stars or
single Persons, yet I should also think it but equal to demand, What Reason there
is to perswade, that these Stars were other than the seven President Presbyters, who
were Chair-men in the several Presbyteries of those seven Churches? Which
Churches I take to be single Congregations. For I see as yet no Reason, but that
as a Letter intended for the Honourable House of Commons, may be directed to
the Speaker, so these Epistles intended for the seven Churches (for that they
were, <HI>Rev. 2. 7, 11, 17, &amp;c.</HI>) might be superscribed [for the Chief Pastor or
President Presbyter] who probably at that Time was stiled the Bishop, by way
of Appropriation.</P>
<P>In fine, what if by the Name of Angel, an Angel properly so called should be
understood? And that the Epistles intended for the Churches [Pastors and People,]
were sent to them under the Name of their Guardian Angels? Should this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e so,
then farewel to any Ground for Diocesan Bishops in the Directions of the Epistles
to the Angels. And that it should be so is very agreeable to the Prophetical Spirit
in the <HI>Revelation:</HI> For the <HI>Revelation</HI> goes much upon the <HI>Hypothesis</HI> and Language
of <HI>Daniel,</HI> and in <HI>Daniel</HI> we read of the Guardian Angels of Nations, and in such
a manner, that what refers to the Nations, or to their Governours, is said of
the Angels themselves, <HI>Dan.</HI> 10. 13, 20, 21. Which is further confirmed, in
that it seems to have been an <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> obtaining in the first Age of Christianity,
that the several Churches or Assemblies of Christians had their Guardian Angels;
for it is very probable that in Relation and Aspect unto this <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> the Apostle
<HI>Paul</HI> does tell Women, 1 <HI>Cor. 11. 10. That they ought to have power over their heads,
Because of the ANGELS;</HI> the Expression seems to imply, That there were
Angels, <HI>Guardians</HI> of the Assemblies; who observed the Demeanour of All, and
therefore they ought to be Circumspect, Modest and Decent in their Behaviour and
in their Fashions and Garbs, out of Respect to those Guardians.</P>
<P>And indeed the former Account of the Title of Angels, is a more agreeable
and easie one than that which some others give, who by Angel understanding a
Bishop in the Modern Sense of that Word, believe the Denomination given with
reference to a Practice among the Jews, who (they say, as from <HI>Diodorus</HI>) at|tributed
to their High Priest the Title of Angel. But should it be yielded that
the Jews had any such Practice [to attribute the Title of Angel to their High-Priest]
what could this amount unto in our Case, since every Bishop is not an
High Priest, in the Sense of the Jews? For in their Sense there could be but one,
and then, that one among Christians must be a Pope, or a Sovereign Bishop over
all the Bishops; as, among the Jews, the High Priest was over all the Priests. But
<PB N="49" REF="27">
in reality the Jews had no such Practice, nor does the alledged <HI>Diodorus</HI> say they
had, [to call their High Priest Angel] they called him High Priest [<GAP DESC="foreign">,]
that was his name; but indeed, he adds, That they had a Be|lief
of him, That he was (often) made a Messenger or Angel of God, [<GAP DESC="foreign">,]
as really he was, when he had the Urim on him; and
this is all that <HI>Diodorus</HI> affirms.</P>
<P>Your other Argument (for Diocesan Episcopacy,) which you ground upon
the Traditional Succession of <HI>Bishops</HI> in several <HI>Sees,</HI> down from the Times of the
Apostles, and in the <HI>Seats</HI> of the Apostles, has no more of cogency in it than the
former. I know <HI>Tertullian l. de praescript. adv. Hae etieos,</HI> says, <HI>Precurre Ecclesias
Apostolicas apud quas ips<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> adhus Cathedrae Apostolorum suis locis praesidentur,</HI> &amp;c. And I
acknowledg, the Apostles may well enough be said to have sate in <HI>Chairs,</HI> and
others to succeed in them, if the Chairs be understood of Chairs of Doctrin, in the
same Sense in which the Scribes and Pharisees are said to sit in <HI>Moses</HI>'s; for in
this Sense, All those Churches were Apostolical, and had Apostolical Succession,
which being founded upon the <HI>Doctrin</HI> of the Apostles, had such perso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s only in
any Authority over them, as did continue <HI>therein.</HI> But else, I cannot believe my
self obliged to assent that the Apostles had Chairs in Particular Churches, tho' <HI>Ter|tullian</HI>'s
Words at first Sight may seem to sound that way, than to believe the Story
of the Cells of the 70 Translators; a Story that S. <HI>Hierom</HI> not only confutes but
Ridicules, tho' it has this to be said for it, That <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> affirms he saw the
Ruins of those very Cells, and that they were in the <HI>Pharos</HI> of <HI>Alexandri, Ter|tullian</HI>
flourished but in the beginning of the third Century, by which Time many
Fob Traditions past Current; of which Truth too many Instances are obvious in
the Writings of that Father, as well as of other Fathers. Indeed <HI>Eusebius</HI> has gi|ven
us Catalogues of the Succession of Bishops in several Churches, but these Cata|logues
are only Conjectural and Traditionary. Himself, in the Proem of his
Ecclesiastical History, tells us of a great Chasm that was in that kind of History
for the three first Centuries, and that being alone and solitary in this kind of Per|formance,
he had nothing but Fragments here and there to help him, from any of
those who preceeded (him.) Ay, in the third Book of that History, Chap. 4. he
says expresly, as to the Persons that succeeded the Apostles in the Government of
the Churches, that it is hard to tell particularly and by name, who they were
[quorum nomina <HI>non est facile explicare per singulos.</HI>] And that in making his Ca|talogues
he went by way of Collection and Inference, from what is written by
S. <HI>Paul; [Ex Apostoli tamen Pauli sermonibus colligere possumus, &amp;c.</HI>] so that the
Catalogues of Bishops deduced from the Apostles, for ought I see, deserve but little
more of Credit, as being but little better ascertained than the Catalogue of the
<HI>British Kings,</HI> deduced from <HI>Brute.</HI></P>
<P>In truth, the Task is a little uneasie to make it clear, That the Apostles were
properly Bishops, in the Modern Sense of the Word, and that they had fixed
Seats, which yet is the Basis upon which such Catalogues must stand; sure I am,
<HI>Athanasius</HI> in his Comment upon the Epistle to the <HI>Romans, ad c. 2. v.</HI> 1. affirms
their Office to have been to go up and down and preach, <HI>circumvagari</HI> (as his
Translator renders him) <HI>&amp; Evangelium praedicare;</HI> so that in the Judgment of this
<PB N="50" REF="28">
so celebrated a Father, the Apostles (as such) were but Itinerant Preachers, a
sort of Officers that were unfixed.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Epaphroditus,</HI> I cannot be peswaded by the bare Authority of S. <HI>Hierom</HI>
(whom yet I take for a very Learned as well as Pious Father,) much less by that
of <HI>Walo Messalinus,</HI> to believe against the Analogy of the Text, That he was <HI>Bi|shop</HI>
of the <HI>Philippians,</HI> only because he is called by S. <HI>Paul</HI> their <HI>Apostle, Phil.</HI> 2. 25.
The Observation <HI>Walo</HI> has made of the Word [<HI>Apostle,</HI>] that it is never used by
the Evangelists, by S. <HI>Paul</HI> in any other Place, or by the other Apostles, but on|ly
<HI>De Sancto Ministerio,</HI> will hold no Water; for I take it that <HI>Iohn</HI> 13 16. in
which Place the Word is used in a Common Promiscuous Sense, and rendred so by
our Translators, stands impregnable, as a plain, direct and unavoidable Instance
against him.</P>
<P><HI>Irenaeus</HI> is also cited, to prove that such a superiority as the Apostles themselves
had in the Church, was transmitted by them unto Bishops; for, say you, this Fa|ther,
who distinguishes between the Bishops and Presbyters, affirms, That the
Apostles delivered to the Bishops, <HI>suum ipsorum locum</HI> Magisterii, their own Place
of Magisteriality or Government. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> flourished towards the End of the <HI>2d</HI>
Century, and yet so near as he was to the Apostles own Times, if he affirmed,
as he is ageed by the most (tho' not by all) to have done, That our Lord Christ
did undergo his Passion in the fiftieth Year of his Age, we shall have little Reason
to be fond of his Authority, in Matters which he takes upon Trust, and by meer
Report. But admitting <HI>Irenaeus</HI>'s Authority (which I am unwilling to lessen) to
be as unblemished and as tight as one could wish it, yet on this occasion it will do
you but small Service; for the Force of the Testimony which you cite from him,
depends on the Word <HI>Magisterium;</HI> and <HI>Magisterium</HI> signifies not, as you under|stand
it, [a Masterly Authority] but [teaching and Doctrin;] for in this lat|ter
Sense the Word is often used by other Fathers, and particularly by S. <HI>Cyprian,</HI>
as you may see <HI>l. 1. ep.</HI> 3. and in other Places; but this is a Sense that maketh no|thing
for you, for then <HI>Irenaeus</HI> means no other than what <HI>Tertullian</HI> also affirms,
and none will deny, that the Apostles delivered over to the Bishops their own
Chairs of Doctrin; so that succeeding Bishops or Pastors were obliged to deliver
no other Doctrin unto their Flocks, but that same which themselves had first re|ceived
from those that were the <HI>Founders</HI> of Christianity.</P>
<P>In fine, as to what you mention (but somewhat invidiously) concerning the
Judgment of the <HI>Assembly</HI> of Divines, the Gangrene of Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and the over|flow
that was of Sects and Heresies in the Late Times (of the Interreign) which
you would insinuate to be occasioned by the Intermission of Episcopacy. I answer,
that there were Sects and Heresies even in the Times of the Apostles, and that
<HI>Irenaeus,</HI> S. <HI>Ausrin, Philastrius</HI> and <HI>Epiphanius</HI> have furnished the Christian World
with large Catalogues of them, and of some in their own times; and yet I doubt
not you will acknowledge, there were Bishops in the Church, even in those times;
So that Episcopacy, if it be not Coercive, is no such Remedy against Sects and He|resies,
as you would have us believe; and if it be Coercive, it is not purely Chri|stian
and Spiritual, but, in so much, has something in it of Secular and Worldly.</P>
<P>Thus I have reinforced my main Argument, and removed such Exceptions as you
<PB N="51" REF="28">
take against it; and now I shall not make your trouble much longer, but to eluci|date
some Incident and By Passages, which I will do with all the Brevity I can, and
without formality of Method, only as they come to my Mind</P>
<P><HI>Peter</HI> is first named where ever the whole Colledge of the Apostles is called
over; but I do not in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er, nor does it enforce, that any Primacy was due unto him,
other than that of Precedence, which All Protestants (generally speaking) al|low
him.</P>
<P>It doth not appear that <HI>Iames</HI> at the Council of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> spake with more
Authority than the other Apostles, as Bishop of the Place and President of the
Synod. <HI>Iesephus</HI> indeed takes notice of him under an eminent Character, for
Piety; but not a word in that Author of his eminent Dignity, as a Prelate. As
for <HI>Paul,</HI> he calls him but plain <HI>Iames,</HI> not Bishop <HI>Iames;</HI> And though he put him
before <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iohn, Gal.</HI> 2. 9. that preference might be only in respect of his
being the Lord's Brother, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 19. and consequently is no great Argument
of his Prelacy, in the modern sense of that word.</P>
<P>So <HI>Zomen</HI>'s Censure of the practice of having more Bishops than one in one City,
does prove that practice; though he did not approve it&punc; <HI>Epiphanius</HI> also is cited
by many to evidence that practice.</P>
<P>I yield not that 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 34. which may be translated [in the Assemblies,]
will demonstrate, that there were, at that time, several separate Meetings for
Christian Offices in one City or Town, where was but one Church; And yet I
grant it might happen to be so, upon Occasion; for our Experience Evinces it
has been so of late, in a time of Persecution, among the Dissenting Churches, and
what has been in our time, might on like Occasions have been before it. How|ever,
this Accident would not prove, nor indeed do I find any other proof, that
there were in the first times of Christianity, Pastors who had the Care of several
Churches; or, that any Church at that time did take in several Cities or Towns,
which were remote; a Church properly being a Coagregation, and consequently
the People of a Vicinage or Neighbourhood, under Orders. <HI>Cenchrea,</HI> though
one of the Ports of <HI>Corinth,</HI> had a Church of its own, distant from that at <HI>Co|rinth;</HI>
and none, I think, will say, That that Church was Diocesan. The Coun|cil
of <HI>Chalcedon</HI> prohibited absolute Ordinations.</P>
<P>That the end of the World, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 20. is literally to be understood of the
end of the Jewish Policy, or the Mosaical <HI>seculum,</HI> seems evident, by comparing
that Text with the 24. Chapter of the same Evangelist, Ver&punc; 2, 14, and 24. The
meaning of <HI>Mat.</HI> 1. 29. is, That <HI>Ioseph</HI> did not know his Wife till she had brought
forth her First-born, and that it will not follow, that he knew her afterward; And
in this sense of [until] I make it parallel with <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 20. So that when Christ
says, He would be with his Apostles, <HI>until</HI> the end of the Jewish World, he is
plain, he would be with them so long, but doth not imply by that [until] that
he would be with them no longer. Without the favour that we commonly allow
to popular Expressions, what is said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 20. will not hold in the usual <HI>sense</HI>
that is given it, as to the Apostles Successors, and with that favour, I see no
strength in any Arguments against <HI>mine,</HI> which carries it, in the Letter unto the
Apostles.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="29">
If the Apostles must not be understood to stand Personally, and only for themselves in that
Commission, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. they must be understood to stand in it Representatively, for the whole
Church, or Body of Christian People, in that same manner as they stood for them in the Istitu|tion
of the Lord's Supper, when it was said to them [<HI>Do this in remembrance of me.</HI>] these
words being said to them, not as they were Ministers, but as Communicants, <HI>Take ye, eat ye, take,
drink, do this in remembrance of me;</HI> For else there is no Canon of Communion for the Common
People, or Laity. Now I pray tell me, which of these <HI>Notions</HI> did the Apostles stand in when
they received that Commission, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. was it given to them as they stood Personally, for so
many single Men, or as they represented the whole Community and Body of Christians? in One
of these <HI>Two,</HI> they must necessarily stand; For the Apostles Collectively and all together, as a
Body are never taken but in one or the other sense; they no where representing only the Mini|sters
or Pastors; so that, by the Letter of the Commission, which is directed to the Body of
the Apostles, either all Christians are impowered to Baptize and Preach, which I suppose you
will not say, or else only the Apostles.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that <HI>Cyprian,</HI> though he calls the Presbyters his <HI>Compresbyters,</HI> yet never calls them
his <HI>Colleagues;</HI> He does not call them fellow Bishops, tho he calls them fellow Presbyters because tho
every Bishop was a Presbyter, yet every Presbyter was not a Bishop, in the appropriate sense of that
word. However, tho he does not say of Presbyters in so many words, that they are the Colleagues of a
Bishop, yet he comes very near it, when he tells them they are <HI>Compresidents</HI> with him, which he does
<HI>L. 1. Ep.</HI> 3. when writing to <HI>Cornelius</HI> that was a Bishop, he has this Expression [<HI>Florentissim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
CLEROTECVM PRAESIDENTI</HI>]. To the most flourishing Clergy that presides
<HI>together with thee.</HI> And in truth, one must have read but little in S <HI>Cyprian,</HI> to be ignorant that
in his time the Presbyters or Clergy were joyned with the Bishop in Acts of Jurisdiction; and
that not only the Clergy, but even the People too, had a great share therein, as well as the Bi|shops.
And this, as in other matters, so even in those that related unto Bishops themselves. No
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> than all this is implyed in that Expostulation of <HI>Cyprian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">: An ad hoc frater Carissime deponenda

<P>To conclude: That Alterations have been often made in the Church, both as to Government
and Discipline, is so great and plain a truth, that none that knows the History can doubt of it
some of these came in early, by several steps, and others afterwards upon occasions that could not
be foreseen. Some things in the Church are Fundamental, and of an Immutable nature. But there
are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> that relate to Government, Discipline and Administration, which depending upon the
variable Circumstances of Times, Places, and Occasions, are, and must be, left to Christian
Prudence. The Grounds I go upon in my Scheme, in which I have set out the principal Alter|ations
that have been made, are owned by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as to one Instance, (and the
Reason of that one will hold in more.) when in its Canons and Constitutions, agreed <HI>An. Dom.</HI>
