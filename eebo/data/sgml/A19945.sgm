<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_BEING induced by some priuate reasons, and by the instant entreaty of speciall friends, to suffer some of my worthlesse poems to be publi|shed, I desired to make some writ|ten by my deere friends <HI>Anonymoi,</HI> and my deerer <HI>Brother,</HI> to beare them company: Both without their consent, the latter being in the low-Country warres, and the rest vtterly ignorant thereof. My friends names I concealed; mine owne and my brothers, I willed the Printer to suppresse, as well as I had concealed the other, which he ha|uing put in without my priuity, we must now vnder|go a sharper censure perhaps then our namelesse workes should haue done, and I especially. For if their Poems be liked, the praise is due to their in|uention: if disliked, the blame both by them, and all men, will be deriued vpon mee, for publishing that which they meant to suppresse.</P>
<P>If thou thinke we affect fame by these kinds of writings, though I thinke them no disparagement euen to the best iudgements, yet I answere in all our behalfes, with the princely shepheard <HI>Dorus&punc;</HI></P>
<Q>Our hearts do seeke another estimation.</Q>
<P>If thou condemne Poetry in generall, and affirme that it doth intoxicate the braine, and make men vt|terly vnfit, eyther for more serious studies, or for any actiue course of life, I onely say, <HI>Iubeo te stultum esse libenter.</HI> Since experience proues by examples of many, both dead and liuing, that diuers delighted,
<PB REF="4">
and excelling herein, being Princes or States-men, haue gouerned and counselled as wisely, being soul|diers, haue commanded armies as fortunately, being Lawyers, haue pleaded as iudicially and eloquently, being Diuines, haue written &amp; taught as profound|ly, and being of any other profession, haue dischar|g&egrave;d it as sufficiently as any other men whatsoeuer: If liking other kinds, thou mislike the Lyricall, because the chiefest subiect thereof is Loue; I reply, that louc being vertuously intended, and worthily placed, is the whetstone of wit, and spurre to all generous ac|tions: and many excellent spirits with great fame of wit, and no staine of iudgement, haue written ex|cellently in this kind, and specially the euer-praise|worthly <HI>Sidney:</HI> So as if thou will needs make a fault, for mine owne part,</P>
<Q>Hand timeo, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">i iam neque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> defendere crimen Cum tanto commune viro.</Q>
<P>If any except against the mixing (both at the be|ginning &amp; end of this booke) of diuerse things writ|ten by great &amp; learned personages, with our meane and worthlesse scriblings, I vtterly disclaime it, as being done by the Printer, eyther to grace the fore|front with Sir <HI>Philip Sidneys,</HI> and others names, or to make the booke grow to a competent volume.</P>
<P>For these Poems in particular, I could alledge these excuses, that those vnder the name of <HI>Anonymos</HI> were written (as appeareth by diuers things to Sir <HI>Philip Sidney</HI> liuing, and of him dead) almost twenty yeares since, when Poetry was farre from that per|fection, to which it hath now attained; that my bro|ther is by profession a Souldier, and was not 18 years old when he writ these toyes: that mine owne were made most of them sixe or seuen yeares since, at idle
<PB REF="4">
times as I iourneyed vp and downe during my tra|uails. But to leaue their works to iustifie themselues, or the Authors to iustifie their works, and to speake of mine owne; thy mislikes I contemne, thy praises (which I neither deserue, nor expect) I esteeme not, as hoping (God vvilling) ere long, to regaine thy good opinion, if lost; or more deseruedly to conti|nue it, if alreadie obtained, by some grauer worke. <HI>Farewell.</HI></P>

<HEAD>YET OTHER TWELVE WON|ders of the World, neuer before published, By IOHN DAVIS.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I. The Courtier.</HEAD>
<L>LOng haue I liu'd in Court, yet learn'd not all this while</L>
<L>To sel poore sutors, smoke: nor where I hate to smile:</L>
<L>Superiors to adore, inferiors to despise,</L>
<L>To flie from such as fall, to follow such as rise,</L>
<L>To cloake a poore desire vnder a rich array,</L>
<L>Not to aspire by vice, though twere the quicker way.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II. The Diuine.</HEAD>
<L>My calling is Diuine, and I from God am sent,</L>
<L>I will no chop-church be, nor pay my patron rent,</L>
<L>Nor yeeld to sacriledge, but like the kind true mother,</L>
<L>Rather will loose all the child, then part it with another.</L>
<L>Much wealth I will not seeke, nor worldly masters serue,</L>
<L>So to grow rich &amp; fat, while my poore flock doth sterue</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III. The Souldier.</HEAD>
<L>My occupation is the noble trade of Kings,</L>
<L>The tryall that decides the highest right of things:</L>
<L>Though MARS my Master be, I doe not VENVS loue,</L>
<L>Nor honour BACCHVS oft, nor often sweare by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">OVE:</L>
<L>Of speaking of my selfe, I all occasion shunne,</L>
<L>And rather loue to doe, then boast what I haue done.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IIII. The Lawyer.</HEAD>
<L>The Law my calling is, my robe, my tongue, my pen,</L>
<L>Wealth and opinion gaine, and make me Iudge of men,</L>
<L>The knowne dishonest cause, I neuer did defend,</L>
<L>Nor spun out sutes in length, but wisht and sought an end:</L>
<L>Nor counsaile did bewray, nor of both parties take,</L>
<L>Nor euer tooke I see for which I neuer spake.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<PB N="2" REF="10">
<HEAD>V. The Phisitian.</HEAD>
<L>I study to vphold the slipperie state of man,</L>
<L>Who dies, when we haue done the best and all we can.</L>
<L>From practise and from bookes I draw my learned skil,</L>
<L>Not from the known receipt of Pothecaries bill.</L>
<L>The earth my faults doth hide, the world my cures doth see.</L>
<L>What youth and time effects, is oft ascrib'de to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI. The Merchant.</HEAD>
<L>My trade doth euery thing, to euery land supply,</L>
<L>Discouer vnknown coasts, strange Countries doth ally:</L>
<L>I neuer did forestall, I neuer did ingrosse,</L>
<L>Nor custome did withdraw, though I return'd with losse.</L>
<L>I thriue by faire exchange, by selling and by buying,</L>
<L>And not by Iewish vse, reprisall, fraude, or lying.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII. The Country-Gentleman.</HEAD>
<L>Though strange outla~dish spirits praise towns, &amp; country scorn</L>
<L>The cou~try is my home, I dwel where I was born:</L>
<L>There profit and commaund, with pleasure I partake,</L>
<L>Yet do not Haukes, and dogs, my sole companions make.</L>
<L>I rule, but not oppresse, end quarrels, not maintaine,</L>
<L>See towns, but dwel not there t'abridg my charg or train</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII. The Bacheler.</HEAD>
<L>How many things as yet are deere alike to me,</L>
<L>The field, the horse, the dog, loue armes or libertie.</L>
<L>I haue no wife as yet, whom I may call mine owne,</L>
<L>I haue no children yet, that by my name are knowne.</L>
<L>Yet if I married were, I would not wish to thriue,</L>
<L>If that I could not tame the veriest shrew aliue.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX. The married man.</HEAD>
<L>I onely am the man among all married men,</L>
<L>That doe not wish the Priest, to be vnlinkt agen:</L>
<L>And thogh my shoo did wring, I wold not make my mone</L>
<L>Nor think my neighbors chance more happy then mine own</L>
<L>Yet court I not my wife, but yeeld obseruance due,</L>
<L>Being neither fond, nor crosse, nor iealous, nor vntrue.</L>

<HEAD>X. The Wife.</HEAD>
<L>The first of all our Sex came from the side of man,</L>

<L>I doe not visit oft, nor many, when I doe:</L>
<L>I tell my minde to few, and that in counsaile too.</L>

<L>My husba~d knew, how much his death wold grieue me,</L>

<HEAD>XII. The Maide.</HEAD>
<L>I marriage would forsweare, but that I heare men tell,</L>
<L>That she that dies a maide, must lead an Ape in hell.</L>
<L>Therefore if fortune come, I will not mocke and play,</L>
<L>Nor driue the bargaine on, till it be driuen away.</L>

<L>A man that wanteth gold, then gold that wants a man.</L>

I am a Marriner, and am now come from the sea, where I had the fortune to light vpon these few trifles. I must confesse I came but lightly by them, but I no sooner had them, but I made a vow that as they came to my hands by fortune, so I would not part with them but by fortune. To that end I haue euer since carried these Lots about me, that if I met with fit company I might deuide my booty among them. And now (I thanke my good for|tune) I am lighted into the best company of the world, a company of the fairest Ladies that euer I saw. Come Ladies trie your fortunes, and if any light vpon an vn|fortunate blanke, let her thinke that fortune doth but mocke her in these trifles, and meanes to pleasure her in greater matters.</HI></P>
