<P>2. For ther cometh often-times / a certen Ioy
vnto the Man / which-proceedeth not out of the vp|right
Beeing of God / nether-yet bideth thesame as
a stedfast Beeing / with the Man: and for-that-cause
it is not the euerlasting Ioy / which the gra|cious
Woord requireth or promiseth. And therfore
shall the Man alwayes place or sett his Ioy / in

<P>4. And when hee then becometh quitt againe of

a great Greef vnto him. And when hee then find|eth
himself againe in such Heauynes / so doth hee

addeth more Sorrowe / of his owne Sorrowe / 
therto: and getteth euenso somtimes / an<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1. Reg. 16. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 18. c. 19. b.</NOTE> vnquiet

Oh / that I had kept thesame! Oh / it must be myne
