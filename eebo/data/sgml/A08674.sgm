to your protection this translati|on of <HI>Ovids</HI> Elegies, who I thinke was even rockt in his cradle by the Muses, and fed with Sugar and Helliconian water, which made him have so sweet a veine of Poetry. So that the name of <HI>Ovid</HI> is a sufficient commendati|on for any worke of his, if my English can but like the Eccho, send backe the soft Musicke of his lines. And indeede if he write best of love that hath beene in love; and that there is a certaine <GAP DESC="foreign"> or efficacie in his words that feeles the affection; I doubt not but my owne sorrow hath learnt me how to translate <HI>Ovids</HI> sorrow. For I confesse I was ne|ver in Fortunes Books, and there|fore am not much indebted to her, neyther doe I care for her frownes; but I am greeved for one who is my brother in mis|fortune,
<PB REF="2">
who is <HI>exul in patria,</HI> be|ing enforced to let that skill and experience which he hath gotten abroad in marine affaires, and which hath beene approved of both by the English and Dutch nations in severall long voyages, lye dead in him for want of im|ployment which is the life of practicall knowledge: and though he must be compelled by his pre|sent fates to accept of the imploy|ment of forraine nations, yet if a way might be opened unto him he is more willing (as he is bound by dutie) to serve his native King and Countrey, which desire of his I know your generous dispo|sition cannot but cherish, and ap|prove of my love towards him. This Booke <HI>Ovid</HI> sent to the Cit|ty of <HI>Rome</HI> as appeares by the first verse, <HI>Parve nec invideo, &amp;c.</HI> and I am now to send it forth into a
<PB REF="3">
Citty abounding with Critticks, and therefore it desires your wor|thy patronage and defence; for which (if <HI>Ovid</HI> lived) he would make his fluent Muse expresse his thankefulnesse: But I for any fa|vour which you shall shew unto this translation, must acknowledge my selfe bound unto your vertue, which I wish may shine forth in prosperous actions, untill your fame be equall to <HI>Caesars</HI> who ba|nisht <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>

<L>Or keepe his cold limbes in the bed by force,</L>
<L>Or passe away the day with some discourse?</L>
<L>Or that could feele his pulse when it did beate,</L>
<L>Or apply to him warme things to cherish heate?</L>
<L>Or close his eyes even swimming round with death,</L>

<L>There were none, for his ancient friends then were</L>
<L>In thee O <HI>Rome,</HI> from <HI>Pontus</HI> distant farre.</L>

<L>His daughter went not with her banisht father.</L>

<L>And the skin-wearing <HI>Getes</HI> wirh stony hearts.</L>
<L>The <HI>Sarmatian</HI> riding on his horse was there,</L>
<L>To comfort him with lookes that dreadfull were.</L>
<L>Yet when he was dead, the <HI>Bessi</HI> wept, the <HI>Gete,</HI></L>

<HEAD>ELEGIE. I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IF any faults are in these bookes of mine,</L>
<L>Have them excused Reader by their time.</L>
<L>I sought no fame, but onely some releefe,</L>
<L>That so my mind might not thinke on her griefe.</L>
<L>Even as the Ditcher bound with fetters strong,</L>
<L>Will lighten heavy labour with a song:</L>
<L>And he will sing that with a bended side,</L>
<L>Doth draw the slow boate up against the tide:</L>
<L>And he that at the Oare doth tug with paine,</L>
<L>Doth sing while he puts backe his oare againe.</L>
<L>The weary Shepheard sitting on a hill,</L>
<L>Doth please his sheepe with piping on his quill:</L>
<L>And every maid within the Contrey bred,</L>
<L>Will sing while she is drawing forth her thred.</L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> being sad for <HI>Brisis</HI> losse,</L>
<L>The <HI>Haemonian</HI> harpe did soften that same crosse.</L>
<L>While <HI>Orpheus</HI> for his wife much griefe did shew,</L>
<L>With his sweet tunes the woods and stones he drew.</L>
<L>So did my Muse delight me as I went,</L>
<L>And bore me company in my banishment.</L>
<L>She feard no trechery, nor the Souldiers hand,</L>
<L>Nor yet the wind, or sea, or barbarous land.</L>
<L><PB REF="29">She knew what error first my ruine brought,</L>
<L>And that there was no wickednesse in my fault:</L>
<L>And since from her my fault did first proceed,</L>
<L>She is made guilty with me of that deed.</L>
<L>Yet still the feare of harme me so affrights,</L>
<L>I scarse dare touch the Muses holy rites.</L>
<L>But now a sudden fury doth me move,</L>
<L>And being hurt by verse, yet verse I love.</L>
<L>Even as <HI>Vlysses</HI> tooke delight to taste,</L>
<L>The Lote tree which did hurt him at the last.</L>
<L>The Lover feeles his losse, yet does delight</L>
<L>In it, and seekes to feede his appetite.</L>
<L>So Bookes delight me which did me confound,</L>
<L>Loving the Dart which gave me this same wound.</L>
<L>Perhaps this study may a fury seeme,</L>
<L>And yet to many it hath usefull beene.</L>
<L>It makes the mind that it cannot retaine,</L>
<L>Her griefe in sight, but doth forget the same.</L>
<L>As she ne're felt the wound which <HI>Bacchus</HI> gave,</L>
<L>But wildly on the Idean hils did rave:</L>

<L>Who from their <HI>Helicon</HI> did come with me.</L>
<L>And for to follow me they still did please,</L>
<L>Either by foote, by shipping, or by seas.</L>
<L>And may they gracious unto me abide,</L>
<L>Since that the gods are all on <HI>Caesars</HI> side:</L>

<L>Doth give some signe, then all do arme apace.</L>
<L>The enemie with his poyson'd shafts and bow,</L>
<L>On their proud Steeds about the walles do go:</L>

<L>In this place I a dweller am become,</L>
<L>A lasse my time of life too slow doth runne.</L>
<L>Yet to my verse I do returne againe,</L>
<L>My friendly Muse doth me in griefe sustaine:</L>
