<P><HI>When first I treated of this Subject, I had no thoughts of printing it in any other Book, than in your breasts.

of the living God) Yet since that, I have been induced to make these familiar Directi|ons more publique, up|on these Considerati|ons;</P>
<P N="1">1. That I might gra|tifie your pious request in publique to me, That these <HI>Instructions</HI> might be printed, which you apprehend might be of such frequent use and advantage to you and yours, before, in, and after every <HI>Lords Sup|per.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="4">2.

<PB REF="4">
so as to seek the Lord herein, in a right Order. And I perswade my self that those things which were so acceptable to you in my <HI>Sermons</HI>; will be the more profitable to you in my <HI>Book.</HI> If your souls prosper, my heart shall rejoyce. I shall count it my Crown and glory, to promote your Grace and Glory. It will be my Heaven here, to help you forward to|wards Heaven hereaf|ter. And in order here|unto, I hope I shall wil|lingly
<PB REF="5">
<HI>preach; print, and bestow my pains in pub|lique or private amongst you, that I may more and more endeare you and</HI> es|pouse you unto Iesus Christ; <HI>For I trust I may truly say with the A|postle,</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Phi. 1.8. to 12.</NOTE> God is my re|cord, how greatly&punc; I long after you all, in the bowels of Iesus Christ.

<P N="1"><PB REF="9">1. It is not bare partaking, but due partaking of Sacraments, that will commend us to God, and interest us in Christ. It is possible that in a visible Church multitudes may partake Sacraments, and yet be deep|ly displeasing to God. The <HI>Israelites</HI> of old had not only the ordinary and standing Sacraments of <HI>Circumcisi|on</HI> and the <HI>Passeover,</HI> but also the extraordinary and transient Sacra|ments of the <HI>Cloud</HI> and <HI>Sea,</HI> an|swering to our <HI>Baptism</HI>; Of <HI>Man|na</HI> and <HI>water out of the Rock,</HI> answering to our <HI>Lords Supper.</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.1. <HI>to</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>All our Fathers were under the Cloud, and all passed through the Sea: And were all baptized unto</HI> Moses <HI>in the cloud, and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink (for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ:) But with
<PB REF="10">
many of them God was not well plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed, for they were overthrown in the Wilderness. Ishmael</HI> was circumcis'd as well as <HI>Isaac</HI>; yet <HI>Ishmael</HI> is branded for <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 4.29.</NOTE> a Persecuter: <HI>Esau</HI> circumcised as well as <HI>Jacob</HI>; yet <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 9.13.</NOTE> <HI>Jacob loved, Esau hated of God&punc; Simon Magus</HI> baptized, yet <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 8.13.21, 23.</NOTE> <HI>his heart was not right in the sight of God,</HI> and he still remained <HI>in the gall of bitternesse, and bond of iniquity. Ju|das</HI> did eat the <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oh.</HI> 13.2, 21, 16, 27.</NOTE> Sacrament of the Passe|over with Christ and his Disciples; yet after the eating of it, <HI>Satan</HI> more strongly <HI>en|tered into him</HI> then ever before: and he died an hypocrite, a murderer, a devil. And the Corinthians not onely were baptized, but received also the Lords Supper: yet notwith|standing they were <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11 30, 31, 32.</NOTE> <HI>judged of the Lord: many were weak and sickly among them and many slept,</HI> viz. were dead (as is thought of the plague of Pestilence.) Thus we may possibly be <HI>baptized,</HI> yea eat and dri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k the <HI>Lords Supper</HI>; and yet for all
<PB REF="10">
that, through unworthy communicating in|c&ugrave;rre the Lords displeasure.</P>
<P N="2">2. They that partake Sacraments in a vi|sible Church, may so farre notwithstanding be displeasing unto God: As 1. <HI>That</HI> all the Sacraments and Services, they take in hand may be accounted by God as Nullities, as no Sacraments, no Services at all. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.20.</NOTE> <HI>This is not to eat the Lords Supper.</HI> 2. That all their Sacraments and religious performances may be accounted their <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 1.13&punc; 14.</NOTE> sins and abominations, 3. <HI>That</HI> the Sa|craments which were intended for spiritual benefit, shall become a spiritual mischief to their souls through their abuse. That the Lords, Supper instead of nourishing Grace <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.27, 28, 29. <HI>John</HI> 13 2, 27.36.</NOTE> should strengthen sinne; instead of sealing of Remission of our sinnes in Christs blood, should render us <HI>guilty of the body and blood of the Lord,</HI> even guilty of murdering the Lord of Life and Glory. 4. <HI>That</HI> by unworthy handling them, they may incurre many <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 30, 18, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.5, 7, 8, 9, 10. <HI>&amp;</HI> 11.30.</NOTE> temporal afflictions
<PB REF="11">
and chastisements in Gods displeasure. 5. <HI>Finally,</HI> they may enjoy Sacraments; and yet so farre displease God therein, as thereby to hazard <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.29.</NOTE> <HI>their own Judge|ment,</HI> and eternal <HI>Damnation,</HI> and lose Heaven it selfe for ever. As those Iews of old, notwithstanding their enjoyments of Sa|craments <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.1, <HI>to</HI> 6</NOTE> <HI>were overthrown in the wildernesse,</HI> lost <HI>Canaan</HI> the Type of Hea|ven, and, it's to be feared, Heaven it selfe thereby typified.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence consequently these things are clear. I. <HI>That</HI> our bare enjoyment of Sacra|ments, is no infallible signe, either of Gods special love tow, or of our good spiritual state towards God. II. <HI>That</HI> it is altogether un|safe for Christians to rest themselves satisfied and contented with the meere having, or the meer using of Sacraments. It's the Right having and Due using of Sacraments, which will commend us, and our actions about them unto Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. III. <HI>That</HI> it singularly concerns all Gods people to endeavour so to enjoy and
<PB REF="11">
use all Sacraments, and particularly the Lords Supper. Which is often to be receiv|ed, as therein they may be well-pleasing and acceptable to the Lord.</P>
<P>Now that we may acceptably and profita|bly manage the Lords Supper, these things are peculiarly necessary. 1. <HI>A due Pre|paration for the Lords Supper before we commmunicate. 2. A right use of the Lords Supper while we are communica|ting. 3. A Christian conversation suit|able to the Lords Supper, after we have commmunicated.</HI> In reference to these three General Heads, seriously consider, and practically improve these brief <HI>Directions</HI> following.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="17">
with him&punc; he takes this stony heart away and gives him a supple, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eshy, soft, tender heart. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 36.26.</NOTE> <HI>And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. An heart of flesh</HI> is of a tender temper, flexible and easily wrought upon by God, quickly wounded for sinne, facile to melt and dissolve into penitential sorrows; is thine heart such? 4. <HI>By the Obedientialnesse of thine heart.</HI> Where the Law is written in the heart, there the heart becomes obedient to Gods Will, and delights in that obedience. So saith <HI>David,</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Psal, 40.5</NOTE> <HI>I delight to do thy Will, O my God, yea thy Law is within mine heart</HI>: or, (according to the Hebrew phrase,) <HI>thy law is in the midst of my bowels.</HI> Because the Law was graven in his heart, therefore he so delighted to do the Will of God. Dost thou delight now to do thine own Will, the Will of the flesh? or the Will of the Lord?</P>
<P N="3">3. They that are Parties to the New Cove|nant, have a Covenant-relation to God, and a Covenant-interest in God, and God in them. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Jer. 31.33. &amp; 24.7. &amp; 30.27. &amp;c. 32.38. <HI>with</HI> Heb. 8.10.</NOTE> <HI>This shall be the Covenant, &mdash;I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</HI> What greater blessing can God covenant to be|stow on us, then to give himselfe to be our God?

<PB N="11" REF="17">
other hand, what greater duty can lie upon us, then to ingage our selves to be Gods Co|venant-people? Consider now, hath God given himselfe to thee as thy God in Cove|nant? then thou art in Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enant with God. But how shall I know whether God is my God in Covenant? <HI>Answ.</HI> By this. Art thou one of Gods people by Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enant? Art thou thy whole selfe, not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y some part of thy selfe given up to God? Thou must be wholly not partially his. Is thy tongue his, to praise him: Thy hands his, to work his Will: thy feet his, to walk in his paths: thy Mind his, to know him: thy Conscience his, to accuse or excuse under him: thy Will his, to obey him: thy memory his, to retain him: thy heart his, to desire and love him, yea to embrace him with most ravish't affections be|yond all: and in a word, is thy whole selfe, soul and body, with all that is within thee, wholly his sincerely to serve him, and to be a spiritual sacrifice to him? Then thou art in New Covenant with God indeed, and hast inward Right to the Lords Supper.</P>
<P N="4">4. They that are Parties to this New Co|venant, have their iniquities forgiven and forgotten of God. So the Lord covenanteth; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Jer. 31.34 &amp; 33.8.</NOTE> <HI>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will re|member their sin no more.</HI> Or, as the Apostle alledged it, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Heb. 8.12 &amp; 10, 16.17.</NOTE> <HI>I will be merciful to their un|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ghteousnesse, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</HI> Hath the Lord now
<PB N="12" REF="18">
forgiven thine iniquities? then thou art in Co|venant with him indeed.</P>
<P>Thou wilt say, O that mine iniquities were pardoned, then should I be an happy soul. But how may I know that the Lord hath pardoned my sins, and will remember mine iniquities no more? <HI>Answer.</HI> Thou majest know that God hath forgiven thy sins, 1. If thou hast sincerely confessed, bewailed, and forsaken thy sins, and turned from all thine evil wayes; for thus hath God promised. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Prov. 28.13.</NOTE> <HI>He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but who so confesseth and forsaketh them, shall have mercy.</HI>&mdash; <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Isa. 1.16, 17, 18.</NOTE> <HI>Wash ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to doe evil.&mdash;Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD; though your sins be as Scarlet, they shall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wool.</HI> And elsewhere most sweetly; <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Isa. 55.7.</NOTE> <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the un|righteous man his thoughts: and let him returne unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will multiply to pardon.</HI> 2. If thine heart be calmed and quieted through faith in Christ, so that there|by thou art at peace with God. When we through faith have pardon and justification from God, we consequently have peace with God: <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Rom. 5.1.</NOTE> <HI>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God.</HI> Is God pacified towards thee? doth he smile upon thee? doth he still thy
<PB N="13" REF="18">
soul with true peace? this is an Argument of thy sins pardon. 3. If thine heart be singu|larly inflamed with the love of Christ, through whom thy sins are pardoned, it's a great evidence thy sins are forgiven. The woman that <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Luke 7.38, 47.</NOTE> <HI>had many sins forgiven her by Christ, she loved him much</HI>; upon that ac|count, <HI>She wept and washed his feet with tears, she wiped them with the hairs of her head, she kissed his feet, and anointed them with oynt|ment.</HI> Nothing was too good, too dear for Christ, that had paid all her debts, forgiven all her sins. 4. If thou art earnest with God more and more for assurance of pardon, for purity of heart, and stablishment in the wayes of grace for time to come; it's a good signe thy sins are pardoned. God told <HI>Da|vid</HI> by <HI>Nathan</HI>; <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 12.13.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not die.</HI> Vpon this <HI>David</HI> prays so pathetically, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ps. 51.1.2, 7&punc; 8, 12.</NOTE> <HI>Purge me with Hy|sope, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter then Snow. Make me to hear joy and gladnesse.&mdash;Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit.</HI> 5. Finally, it's a signe thy sins are pardoned, if thy heart and soul, and all within thee be singularly inlarged to blesse and praise God for his pardons. So it was with <HI>David</HI>; <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Ps. 103.1 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>Blesse the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, blesse his holy name. Blesse the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his bene|fits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
<PB N="14" REF="19">
healeth all thy diseases.</HI> If thine heart feel his pardons, thy mouth will sing his praises.</P>
<P N="5">5. Lastly, they are parties to the New Covenant, that have Gods fear so implanted in the heart, as not to depart from him. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Jer. 32.40.</NOTE> <HI>And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to do them good: but I will put my fear in their hearts, and they shall not depart from me.</HI> A|postates and Back-sliders were never truly in Covenant with God. All in Covenant with God, persevere: for <HI>God will not forsake them,</HI> and <HI>they shall not forsake him</HI>; his <HI>fear in them</HI> shall be their Preservative. Now then, if the <HI>Lords fear in thee,</HI> keep thee from falling away, thou art in Covenant with God.</P>
<P>Thus thou mayest from the substance and nature of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> discover w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|ther thou beest a Party to the New Cove|nant, having true inward interest therein, and consequently having true inward Right to the <HI>New Covenant-Seale</HI> the <HI>Lords Sup|per</HI> in respect of God himselfe.

Thou shalt be no usurper: in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat regard come and well-come. Thus ex|amine, <HI>What right thou hast to the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="19"><HI>What need we have of the Lords Supper.</HI> As we should examine our <HI>Right</HI> to it, that we be not usurpers; so we should search what need we have of it, that we be not despisers of the Lords Supper; <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Pro. 27.7</NOTE> <HI>The full soul loatheth an Honey-combe.</HI> Sense of want excites desire, and enlivens the appetite after what we want.

<P>Now Christians have <HI>need,</HI> urgent, pres|sing need of the Lords Supper in many re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pects. Examine thou, whether thou hast not great need of it in all these res|pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hast thou not great need, often to nou|rish, strengthen and comfort thine inward man with all the graces and spiritual abilities thereof? Consider, 1.

Paul</HI> saith in the Person of the Regenerate; <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Rom. 7.21, 22, 23.</NOTE> <HI>I finde a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the Law of God after the inward man. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my minde, and bring|ing me into Captivity to the law of sin.</HI> Hast thou not need now to nourish thine imperfect graces, that they may grow up to perfecti|on: thy weake graces, that they may be strong: thine assaulted graces that they may not faile?</P>
<P>Behold now what need thou hast of the Lords Supper to these ends. For what nou|rishing ordinance is this Sacrament for all these purposes? For it's stiled <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.20.</NOTE> <HI>The Lords Supper.</HI> It's <HI>A Supper,</HI> therefore, suitable to nourish the inward man; <HI>The Lords Supper,</HI> therefore sufficient to nourish it effectually.

Here is <HI>meat indeed,</HI> Christs body; and <HI>drink indeed,</HI> Christ blood; and both tendred most fa|miliarly in this Ordinance, and most effe|ctually.

Herein Christ seems as it were thus to speak to every worthy Communicant; <HI>I poured out my blood to procure the Remission of thy sins: and I give thee this Sacramental wine, this pledge of my Blood, to assure thee in particular of the Remission of thy sinnes; that as veri|ly as thou drinkest this wine, so verily thou hast pardon of thy sinnes through my blood.</HI> Oh they are happy that have their sinnes pardoned!

forget one another, nor can endure to be forgotten one of another. Hence the Church desires Christ, to <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Cant. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>set her as a Seal upon his heart, and as a Seale upon his arme</HI>; that we might never be for|gotten of him: proportionably we should <HI>se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Christ as a Seale on our heart, and as a Seale on our arme,</HI> that we might never forget him. 2. That to forget Christs death for sinners, argues great ingratitude; For, what greater love could Christ ever have manifested unto us then to die for us? <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">John 15.13.</NOTE> <HI>Greater love then this hath no man,</HI> than this, <HI>that a man lay down his life for his friends</HI>: Yet Christs love great|er then mans love; for, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Rom. 5.6, 8.10.</NOTE> <HI>When we were yet without strength while we were yet sinners, when we were even enemies, Christ died for us.</HI> Now to bury in oblivion Christs greatest ex|pression of love, cannot but be great ingra|titude. As <HI>David</HI> quickens his soul <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ps. 103.1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>not to forget all Gods benefits,</HI> lest he thereby should be unthankful.

For, Christ is he whom the <HI>Christian</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Cant. 1&punc; 7</NOTE> <HI>soul loves,</HI> and loves to remember.

And Christs death is that whereby <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Rev. 1.5.</NOTE> our sins are washed away and purged, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Col. 1.20.21&punc; 22.</NOTE> our re|concilement with God is obtained, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Gal. 3.13.</NOTE> Gods Curse is removed from us; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Col. 2.14, 15.

Thou canst not live without Christ and his death; hast thou not need then that Christ and his death should still live in thine heart and me|mory?</P>
<P>Consequently thou hast great need of the Lords Supper. The Lords supper is as a last|ing Monument of Christs death, a Marble Pillar on Christs grave. Christ living, erect|ed this Monument and Memoriall of Christ dying. In the Institution he saith of the bread <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Luke 22.19.</NOTE> <HI>Do this in Remembrance of me.</HI> And of the Cup, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.25.</NOTE> <HI>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me.</HI> And of them both, saith <HI>Paul, As oft as ye eat this bread, and drink of this Cup, ye do shew the Lords death till he come.</HI> So then, in the Lords Supper, thou hast Jesus Christ as it were evidently crucified before thine eyes. Canst thou see this <HI>bread broken,</HI> and the wine distinctly se|vered from the bread, and not call to minde
<PB N="21" REF="22">
(according to the Scripture) Christs Agony in the Garden, his sufferings in the High-Priests Pallace, and his Crosse upon <HI>Mount Calvary,</HI> in all which places he freely shed his blood for thee? Canst thou take and eat this bread; take and drink this Cup; and in so doing not apprehend Christ stooping from heaven to feed thy soul with bread of Life, his own body: and water of life, his own blood? Christ bowing his head upon the Crosse to kisse thee; Christ opening his side to heale and wash thee; and Christ conde|scending to thy senses as once to <HI>Thomas,</HI> say|ing; <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Joh. 20.27.</NOTE> <HI>Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, &amp; reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side, and be not faithlesse, but be|lieving.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hast thou not great need to maintaine, increase and evidence to thy selfe more and more, thy spiritual Communion with Jesus Christ and him Crucified? Behold 1. This Fellowship &amp; Communion with Christ, is the Saints spiritual Paradise: their Heaven on Earth. Therein we enjoy his person, and all sweet relations to his person; his Death, and all the saving fruits, priviledges, and in|fluences of his death. Hereby we are <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Cant. 2.4.</NOTE> <HI>brought into Christs banqueting house; held in his Galler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, his Banner over us being love</HI>; &amp; are carried up into the Mount with Christ, as it were to behold Christ trasfigured, and may say with Peter, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Mat. 17.1, 2, 3.4.</NOTE> <HI>Master, it's good for us to be
<PB N="22" REF="23">
here, and let us build Tabernacles.</HI> Oh thrice happy soul that may thus lodge in Christs bosome, and Christ dwell in their hearts! 2. This dear Communion with Christ may be much obscured and interrupted; <HI>Some|times</HI> by <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Cant. 5.2, 3, 4&punc; 5.</NOTE> carnal security creeping upon the Church, which causeth Christ to withdraw himself from her: <HI>Sometimes</HI> by a Churches <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Rev. 2.4, 5</NOTE> decay in her first love to Christ and his wayes; which provokes Christ to <HI>remove her Candlestick,</HI> (that is, to un-Church her,) <HI>if she repent not</HI>; And when the Candle|stick removes, Christ removes, for he walks among the golden Candlesticks: <HI>Sometimes</HI> by the grosse falls and sins of Gods own peo|ple, which causeth the Lord to <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ps. 51.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 12.</NOTE> <HI>break their bones,</HI> as it were, and to <HI>take away the joy of his salvation</HI>; as in <HI>Davids</HI> case. 3. When this sweet Communion with Christ is inter|rupted, how grievous, painful, and intole|rable is it to the Church and Members of Christ; Then the soul of the Church <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Cant. 5.6 7, 8. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>failed</HI> even <HI>fainted away</HI>; then <HI>she sought Christ, but could not finde him: she called him, but he gave her no answer</HI>; then <HI>she became love-sick</HI>; then she was restlesse till she found him whom her soul loved. These things considered, there's great need of preserving, improving, and clearing to thy self more and more thy Com|munion with Christ.</P>
<P>Now therefore to this purpose thou hast great need of the <HI>Lords Supper</HI>; which to
<PB N="24" REF="23">
thy Soul, to thy Faith, yea even to thy out|ward senses, signifies, seals, and instrumen|tally exhibits this Communion with Christ and his Death. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.16.</NOTE> <HI>The Cup of blessing which we blesse, is it not the Communion of the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Christ?</HI> His Que|stion whether it be so, puts it out of question that doubtlesse it is so. That as verily as we partake that Bread and Cup: so verily we partake, and are strengthened in this fellow|ship with Christ.</P>
<P N="5">5. Finally, Hast thou not great need to confirme and increase spiritual union and communion with the Saints and members of Jesus Christ? Consider well, 1. That the Spiritual Vnion and Communion of Saints is by all means to be preserved and increased. <HI>For,</HI> This is most agreeable to that spiritual Relation wherein they stand one to another in Christ, being <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Joh. 15.1</NOTE> <HI>fellow-branches</HI> in the same <HI>Vine</HI> Christ, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 2.4, 5.

<PB N="24" REF="24">
that ye walke worthy of the vocation where|with ye are called; with all lowlinesse and meek|nesse, with long-suffering, forbearing one ano|ther in love.

And elsewhere <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1.10.</NOTE> <HI>Now I beseech you; brethren, by the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you: but that you be perfectly joyned together in the same minde, and in the same judgement.</HI> This is much com|mended by the Spirit of God; <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Ps. 133.1, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is, for brethre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to dwell even together in unity, &amp;c.</HI> There also it's compared to <HI>Aarons</HI> precious Oynt|ment, and <HI>Hermon's</HI> fruitfull dew.

and devoure one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</HI> In these regard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> there's great need of maintaining and con|firming Vnion and Communion of Saints, and especially in such times as these are, wherein professors of Christ have, by their unparalle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d <HI>Divisions</HI> both in <HI>Iudgment, Affection</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> brought such reproach upon the Gospel and way of truth, prejudice upon their own souls, hazard to the King|dome of Christ, and advantage to the King|dome of Satan.</P>
<P>In this regard what need is there of the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> which in the nature of it tends so much to unite, cement, knit and sodder together the disjoynted members of Christs body? <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.17.</NOTE> <HI>For</HI> (as the Apostle saith) <HI>We being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</HI> As many grains of Wheat make up one loaf; so many members make up one body of Christ.

<P>Now for the opening of the <HI>New Covenant</HI> in some measure: Consider these following Propositions, which may afford some true taste of the nature of the <HI>New Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>New Covenant</HI> is not the same Cove|nant which God <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2.16, 17.</NOTE> made with <HI>Adam</HI> in Inno|cency:
<PB N="83" REF="53">
but far different from it, and that in divers particulars. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> was a Co|venant of amity or friendship made by God with him, as by a Creator with his creature: But the new Covenant is a Covenant of <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5.19, 20.</NOTE> re|conciliation made by God as a Redeemer with the sinner.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Covenant with <HI>Adam</HI> was upon <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2.16, 17. Gal. 3.10.</NOTE> tearms of personal, perfect, and perpetual <HI>Obedience</HI> to the Moral Law written in his heart, the curse and death being threatned to the least transgression thereof: But the <HI>New Covenant</HI> is upon tearms of <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Rom. 3.36. &amp; 4.5. &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.33&punc;</NOTE> <HI>Faith</HI> and new obedience, as the fruit thereof, and testifica|tion of our thankfulness. <HI>The</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Zech. 12.10.</NOTE> <HI>Spirit of Grace,</HI> being promised to work that faith and obedience whereunto eternal lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is pro|mised, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3.

<PB N="84" REF="54">
unto sinners for their salvation.</P>
<P N="2">II. The New Covenant is the same in sub|stance and essential constitution; but far dif|ferent in circumstance and manner of admi|nistration from the Old Covenant. By (<HI>Old Covenant</HI>) I understand <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Eph. 2.12</NOTE> <HI>The Covenant of pro|mise</HI>; That is to say, all the Covenants and Promises touching Christ, from the first pro|mise of <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Gen. 3.15.</NOTE> <HI>The seed of the woman</HI> immediately after the fall, till Christs incarnation, which were made first to <HI>Adam,</HI> and renewed after to <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Gen. 17.1 2, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Abram,</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ex. 34.27.28. Deut. 5.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. and 29.1.</NOTE> <HI>Moses,</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 23.5. with Psal. 89.3, to 38.</NOTE> <HI>David,</HI> and <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 11.16, to 21. and 36.24. to the end.</NOTE> <HI>Israel.</HI> These are called <HI>The Covenants of promise,</HI> because they were made in Christ as then on|ly <HI>promised,</HI> not actually <HI>performed</HI>; and <HI>Co|venants,</HI> not <HI>Covenant</HI>; because though but one Covenant, yet severall times renewed, &amp; that with considerable enlargements from time to time.</P>
<P>Now this New Covenant is the same for <HI>substance</HI> with that Old Covenant, called <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Eph. 2.1, 2</NOTE> <HI>The Covenant of promise.</HI> For, 1. They are both of them the Covenant of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">race, not of Nature. 2. They are both of them the Covenant of Reconciliation with corrupted mankind, not of amity and friendship with incorrupted mankind. 3. Jesus Christ was the Mediatour of them both: though with some difference. <HI>Typically</HI> he was Mediatour of the Old Testament or Covenant, but <HI>Truly</HI> of the New. 4. The termes or condi|tions of them both were the same, <HI>viz.</HI> faith
<PB N="85" REF="54">
in Jesus Christ the Mediatour, not works. 5. The benefits and spirituall advantages of both were the same in the blood of Christ. <HI>viz.</HI> Pardon of sinne; Sanctification of our natures; Enjoyment of gracious interest in, and Communion with God; &amp; Eternal hap|pinesse at last with Christ in heaven, as the tenour of them clearly evidenceth. Herein the Old and New Couenant do notably agree.</P>
<P>But they differ only in some <HI>Circumstances,</HI> and the <HI>manner of Administration.</HI> For 1. The Old Covenant was dark and obscure. All the spiritual mysteries therein being clouded in types and shadowes: A typicall <HI>Priesthood,</HI> typical <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> typical <HI>Altar</HI> and <HI>Taber|nacle,</HI> typical <HI>blood,</HI> typical <HI>Mediatour,</HI> typi|cal <HI>Sacraments,</HI> typical <HI>Canaan,</HI> all typical. Hence in the promulgation of this Old Co|venant in <HI>Sinai,</HI> the Jews <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.18.</NOTE> <HI>came unto black|nesse and darknesse.</HI> But the new Covenant is <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 3.7, to the end.</NOTE> bright and clear, being administred without all types and shadowes, (Christ the body be|ing comn already) in open spiritual glory. The Mosaical <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">2 Cor 3.14.18.</NOTE> <HI>veile is done away in Christ, &mdash; And we all with open face beholding as in a glasse the glory of the Lord.</HI> 2. The Old Co|venant was carnal and earthly in the admini|stration of it: They <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.18, 19.</NOTE> <HI>came to the Mount, that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght be touched, and to the sound of a Trumpet, and the voice of words</HI>: And it brought them to an <HI>earthly Canaan,</HI> and an
<PB N="86" REF="55">
<HI>earthly Ierusalem.</HI> But the <HI>New Covenant</HI> is dispenced spiritually bringing us to the spiri|tual <HI>Canaan,</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.22.</NOTE> <HI>To Mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly</HI> Jerusalem; That we may <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">John. 4.23, 24.</NOTE> <HI>worship God,</HI> the God of Spi|rits, <HI>in Spirit and Truth</HI> 3. The Old Cove|nant was more imperfect, according to the imperfect state of the Church in those times, (which the Apostle compares to <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Gal. 4.1.2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>A child in his non-age and minority.</HI>) And so it was re|vealed more and more clearly by degrees, as the Church grew riper and riper till Christs coming. But the <HI>New Covenant</HI> is perfect and full, never more to be enlarged or en|creased till the end of the world, it being re|vealed, in Christ fulfilled, and comne in the flesh already. 4 The Old Covenant was terrible in the manner of its dispensation, making not only the <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.19, 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>People tremble but</HI> even <HI>Moses himselfe exceedingly to fear and quake.</HI> But the <HI>New Covenant</HI> is dispensed with all inviting amiableness, and alluring sweetness, every thing herein being sweet, pleasant, and delectable nothing at all terri|ble: As appears in that admirable passage to the <NOTE N="a]" PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.22, to 25.</NOTE> <HI>Hebrews.</HI> And if it be said; <HI>God the judge of all</HI> there mentioned is terrible. I an|swer, No; <HI>God the judge of all</HI> is not terrible to them that come into Covenant with him; for he is a <HI>Iudge absolv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng</HI> them, &amp; only a <HI>Iudge condemning</HI> His and all their enemies; and that is most comfortable. 5. That Old Co|venant
<PB N="87" REF="55">
was limited and restrained to the peo|ple of the Jews onely, and to those that be|came Jewish Proselytes: Gentiles were all <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Eph. 1.12.</NOTE> <HI>Strangers to the Covenant of Promise,</HI> But the <HI>New Covenant</HI> is unlimited, universally extended both to <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Eph. 2.14, to 20.</NOTE> Jews and Gentiles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f all sorts. Thus the Old and New Covenant e|specially differ.</P>

<HEAD>5. Knowledge of the Lords Supper it self.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, the fifth and last point of Know|ledge, especially necessary to qualifie a per|son for worthy communicating, is, <HI>The know|ledge of the true nature of Sacraments,</HI> and <HI>particularly of the Lords Supper it self.</HI> For, How can that be duly managed which is not truly understood. To this end we are to know:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Lord hath been wont to deal with his Church and people by way of Sacra|ments in all times and ages. As, 1. With <HI>Adam</HI> and his posterity in a sort. For it is sup|posed by the learned, that when <HI>God</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Gen. 3.21.</NOTE> <HI>cloath|ed Adam and Eve with skins,</HI> he taught them also to sacrifice the bodys of those beasts, with whose skins they were cloathed, and this is the more probable, because the Scripture de|claring <HI>Abels</HI> Religion, makes mention only of his <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Gen. 4.4.</NOTE> <HI>Sacrificing the firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof.</HI> These Sacrifices were types of Christ; yea pledges, tokens, and as it were Sacraments confirming the first promise, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Gen. 3.15.</NOTE> <HI>of the seed of the woman</HI> Jesus Christ. 2. With <HI>Abram,</HI> when God stablished his Covenant with him and his seed, he annexed <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Gen. 17.10, 11.</NOTE> <HI>Circum|cision</HI> as a <HI>Token</HI> or <HI>Sacrament of the Covenant.</HI> 3. With <HI>Israel,</HI> when God by the hand of <HI>Moses</HI> brought them out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> destroy|ing
<PB N="91" REF="57">
<HI>Egypts</HI> first-born that they might let <HI>Is|rael</HI> go, he appointed the Sacrament of the <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ex. 12.1, to 14.</NOTE> <HI>Passeover,</HI> as a pledge of the preservation of all <HI>Israels</HI> first-born from Gods wrath. 4. When God brought them through the wildernesse in an extraordinary sort, <HI>Israel</HI> also had <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10 1, 23, 4.</NOTE> four extraordinary Sacraments, signifying to them spiritual Mysteries in Christ, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) <HI>Baptizing in the cloud,</HI> that both sheltred them from the heat, and guid|ed them in their way. (2) <HI>Baptizing in the Sea,</HI> which saved them when the Egyptians were drowned. (3) <HI>Mannah,</HI> that <HI>spiritual meat.</HI> (4) <HI>Water out of the Rock,</HI> that <HI>spiritual drink.</HI> These four Sacraments were extra|ordinary, and continued but a while, <HI>viz.</HI> du|ring <HI>Israels</HI> abode in the wildernesse: The other lasted till Christs coming in the flesh. 5. With the people of God under the New Testament, the Lord dealeth also by way of Sacraments, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Mat. 28.19.20. 1 Cor. 11 23, 26.</NOTE> ordaining <HI>Baptisme</HI> and <HI>the Lords Supper,</HI> as standing Sacraments till the end of the world.</P>
<P>But why doth the Lord thus deal with his people by way of Sacraments in all ages? <HI>Answ.</HI> This comes to passe, 1. From Gods familiar love and condescension to his peo|ple, delighting most plainly and easily to make known spirituals unto them. 2. From the abstrusenesse and mysteriousnesse of Christ, and the things of Christ, which are sublime, high, heavenly, worthy of the quick|est
<PB N="92" REF="58">
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1.12.</NOTE> in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pection of Angels themselves, and therefore so far above humane <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pprehension in their heavenly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re, that God represents them in earthly resemblances. 3. From the dulnesse of our understandings, in con|ceiving aright of the great Mysteries of Christ; therefore God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oops to us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etting them forth in sensible and visible Elements.

<P N="2">II. Sacraments are part, not of Gods naturall but of his instituted worship. Gods <HI>Naturall worsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p</HI> is that which is required in the first Commandment, and which the <HI>light of Na|ture</HI> dictates to be due unto him. <HI>Instituted worship</HI> is that which is contained in the se|cond Commandment, which light of nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re cannot particularly lead us unto, but onely some pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tive divine Institution. Now Sacra|ments are not of Gods <HI>Natural,</HI> but onely of his <HI>Instituted</HI> worship. No light of nature can intimate to us, that under the Old Te|stament God would be worshipped with <HI>Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">umcision</HI> and the <HI>Passeover,</HI> and under the New Testament with <HI>Baptisme</HI> and the <HI>Lords Supper</HI> had not God by expresse and positive In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">itution appointed both. Whatsoever Sa|craments are they are wholly by Institution. We have no other particular ground, or foundation for them at all. Therefore in the
<PB N="93" REF="58">
administration of the Lords Supper, and of every Sacrament, both Ministers and People respectively must cleave close to the Institu|tion. The neerer we come up thereto, the more acceptable we are to the Lord. As <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11 23, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> both in planting Sacraments at first; and reforming Sacrament-abuses after|wards, precisely followed the Lords Insti|tution.</P>
<P N="3">III. All the Sacraments that ever were institu|ted since <HI>Adam's</HI> fall to this day, were To|kens, Pledges, or Seals of the Covenant of grace. As<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Gen. 17.11. Rom. 4 11.</NOTE>Circumcision was a Token of this Covenant: <HI>a Seal of the righteousnesse of faith, &amp;c.</HI> For since the fall, God never set on foot any other Covenant, but the Cove|nant of Grace. The Old and New Covenant are both the Covenant of Grace. When therefore we come to the Lords Supper, we come to renew Covenant with God, and to have his gratious New Testament sealed to us.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Every Sacrament both ordinary and extraordinary, of Old or New Testament, represents principally Jesus Chrst, and him as crucified. <HI>Adam's</HI> sacrifices, types of Christ the true sacrifice. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Col. 2.11.12.</NOTE> <HI>Circumcision,</HI> a pledge of our <HI>heart-Circumcision</HI> through Christs blood The <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5.7.</NOTE> <HI>Passeover,</HI> a token and type of <HI>Christ our Passeover sacrificed for us.</HI> The <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>extraor|dinary Sacraments, Signes of Christ and his sufferings. By <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Rom. 6.3, 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>Baptisme</HI> we are said to be
<PB N="94" REF="59">
<HI>baptized into Christ,</HI> and <HI>into his death.</HI> And by the <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Cor. 11.26.</NOTE> <HI>Lords Supper, we, so oft as we eat and drink it, are said to shew forth the Lords death until he come.</HI> So that Christ and his death, Christ as crucified, is the golden thread that runs along through every Sacrament, and is the substance and mystery of all Sacraments. When therefore we come to the Lords Sup|per, we come to partake a Seal and solemn Memorial of Christ crucified, and of all the benefits of his death.</P>
<P N="5">V. Sacraments are of severall sorts, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sacraments of the Old Testament,</HI> signifying Christ crucified to come after|wards: and these were either ordinary or extraordinary. <HI>Ordinary Sacraments</HI> of the Old Testament were chiefly two; (1) Cir|cumcision, the initiating Sacrament, deno|ting the<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Col. 2.11 12.</NOTE>cutting off of the corruption of the heart by Christ and his grace. (2) The Passe|over, the consummating Sacrament, signify|ing spiritual nourishment by Christ, and pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ervation from Gods wrath through him. <HI>Extraordinary Sacraments</HI> of the Old Testa|ment were <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> four. (1) <HI>The Cloud.</HI> (2.) <HI>The Sea.</HI> (3) <HI>Mannah</HI> from Heaven. (4) <HI>Water</HI> out of the Rock. All these were Sacraments of the Old Testament. 2. <HI>Sacraments of the New Testament,</HI> signifying Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t crucified already come in the flesh, are two, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) <HI>Baptisme; or</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Mat. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.19. w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th Joh. 1.33.</NOTE> <HI>washing with water in the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</HI>;
<PB N="95" REF="59">
whereby we are solemnly admitted into Christs mystical body visible, signifying and sealing the souls spiritual washing from the guilt and filth of sin by the blood and Spirit of Christ. (2) <HI>The Lords Supper,</HI> or <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.26, 27, 28.</NOTE> <HI>eating bread, and drinking Wine in re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">embrance of Christs body broken, and blood shed,</HI> according to the Institution; whereby o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r spirituall nourishment and growth in Christs mystical body is sealed. <HI>Baptisme</HI> answers to Circum|cision, the Cloud, and Sea; <HI>The Lords Sup|per</HI> to the Paschal Supper, Mannah, and Wa|ter out of the Rock. The Sacraments of the New Testament are for number, more few; for observation, more easie; for signification, more excellent.</P>
<P N="6">VI. In all Sacraments are two parts, and a Sacramental union betwixt them. 1. <HI>The Two Parts,</HI> are (1) <HI>The outward signe,</HI> or signes signifying, as water and washing with it, in Baptism; Bread and Wine with the actions belonging thereto, in the Lords Supper. (2) <HI>The inward mysteries,</HI> signified by those signes, as the washing away of our sins by the blood and Spirit of Christ in Bap|tisme, and the nourishing of our souls by the benefits of Christs death in the Lords Supper. 2. <HI>There is a Sacramental union betwixt the Signes, and things signified,</HI> founded in Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts Institution. Whence the signe is sometimes said to be the thing signified; As,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.26, 28. 1 Cor. 11.25.</NOTE><HI>This is my body: This is my blood; This is the New Te|stament
<PB N="96" REF="60">
in my blood</HI>; And the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thing signi|fied is called the signe&punc; As <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5.7.</NOTE> <HI>Christ our Passe|over is s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">crificed.</HI> This Sacramental union con|sists in a Sacramental relation, which the signes have to the things, in <HI>signifying, sealing,</HI> and <HI>exhibiting</HI> them. Hence flows another <HI>union <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etwixt the worthy Commu|nicant and the Sacrament</HI>; So that he who truly partakes the signe according to Christs Institution, partakes also the thing signified. This is to be well ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erved as a special ground of comfort in communicating.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Finally, The particu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar nature of the Lords Supper may be notably discerned in the causes of it, <HI>viz, Efficient, Material, For|mal,</HI> and <HI>Final.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Efficient cause,</HI> or Author of it, is <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11 23.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord Iesus in the same night in which he was betrayed</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Mat. 28.18.</NOTE> <HI>All power was given to him</HI> as Mediatour, therefore to institute what Ordi|nances he pleased for his Church. He first gave Being to the Lords Supper, and he al|so can give a Blessing and vertue to it, in the right use. In that <HI>night</HI> he instituted it, 1. To shew the abrogation of the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chal-Supper, and the succession of the <HI>Lords Supper</HI> in the room thereof. 2. To imprint more notably a living and lasting character of his death and sufferings upon this Supper. 3. To re|stifie his singular care and love to his Church, in that when he knew he was now ready to be betrayed and crucified, he would leave
<PB N="97" REF="60">
this <HI>Legacy</HI> and <HI>Love-Token of his Supper</HI> to his Church, Now if Christ be the Author of the Lords Supper, we should highly esteem it, Christianly partake it, and walk accord|ingly; knowing that all abuse of the Lords Supper re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ects and terminates upon the Lord Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Material cause,</HI> or matter of it, is <HI>Outward and Inward.</HI> 1. <HI>Outward,</HI> is, (1.) Partly the Elements. <HI>viz.</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.26, 27.</NOTE> <HI>Bread and Wine,</HI> Com|plete Provision against hunger and thirst. Christ gives his Church full nourishment. <HI>Bread</HI> is expressed; <HI>Wine</HI> is figuratively im|plyed in the Cup, because immediately after Christ said, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.29.</NOTE> <HI>Henceforth I will not drink of the fruit of the Vine, &amp;c.</HI> (2) Partly the Sacra|mental actions, which are either on the Mi|nisters part, as <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11 23, 24, 25, Mat. 26.26, 27.</NOTE> <HI>Taking, Blessing,</HI> and <HI>Gi|ving Thanks, Breaking,</HI> and <HI>Giving</HI> to the Communicants; Or on the Communicants part, as <HI>Receiving, Eating,</HI> and <HI>Drinking</HI>: 2. The <HI>Inward matter,</HI> are the Mysteries sig|nified by the outward: As by the Elements of <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI>; Christs <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.26, 28.</NOTE> <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>blood</HI> Christ crucified, our spiritual nourishment. By the actions, Christs separation and Conse|cration to his Mediatory office, Christs bro|kennesse and sufferings for his Elect, Christs free Tender, and bestowing himself for spi|ritual nourishment upon the true Believer; And the believers Accepting and applying of Christ thus tendred particularly.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="98" REF="61">3. <HI>The Formal cause,</HI> or <HI>Forme</HI> of the Lords Supper (understand not the outward, but the inward Form) is that <HI>Sacramental union</HI> that is betwixt the outward and inward mat|ter, betwixt the signes and things signified <HI>viz.</HI> such a Sacramental relation betwixt them, in <HI>signifying, sealing,</HI> and <HI>exhibiting,</HI> and this by vertue of Christs institution, that he who duly receives the signes, receives the things signified, as was said before. As the law of the land makes such a relation be|twixt a twig and a turfe, and the lands whence they are taken, that he who in due form of law takes li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery and seizin of them, is also as fully seized and possessed of the whole Lands or Mannour.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Final cause,</HI> or <HI>End</HI> of the Lords Supper is manifold, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11 24, 25, 26.</NOTE> solemn <HI>Remembrance</HI> of Christ crucified, and <HI>shew|ing forth of Christs death</HI> to the worlds end. 2. The<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11 20, 24, 25.</NOTE>spiritual nourishment of our inward man, of our faith and all our graces for strength and growth. 3.

<P N="2">II. <HI>The Properties of true sanctified knowledge</HI> are the second way, whereby we may examine and try our Knowledge.

<P N="6">6. <HI>A spiritualized knowledge.</HI> True san|ctified knowledge is a spark of heavenly, not of earthly light.

<P>Contrariwise unsound knowledge is carnal, earthly, natural, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the person knowing is: and it apprehends all things, even those that are most spiritual, carnally; yea, and it looks upon the counsels and wayes of God as <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 2.14. and 2 Cor. 4.3.</NOTE> <HI>foolishness,</HI> riddles, paradoxes. <HI>The Gospel is</HI> sealed up and <HI>hid from them that are lost.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>A pure knowledge.</HI> Sound sanctified knowledge, is a sin-purging knowledge. It will not suffer a man habitually to wallow in the puddle of any known sin: but puts a man upon denying, mortifying, and abhorring of all filthiness. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Jam. 3.17</NOTE> <HI>The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, &amp;c.</HI> And the Apostle <HI>Iohn</HI> is very positive; <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 3.6</NOTE> <HI>Whoso|ever sinneth, viz.</HI> habitually, and as carnal men sin) <HI>hath not seen him, neither known him.</HI>

<P>True knowledge cannot chuse but make obedient. For, 1. Knowledge of God and his wayes, fills with love to them. And <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Joh. 14.14. 2 Cor. 5.14 1 Joh. 5.3.</NOTE> love sweetly compells to obedience. 2. True know|ledge discovers the excellency of the spiritual path wherein we are to walk, and that moves to obedience. 3.

It is not a <HI>Faith of Miracles,</HI> or Miracle-working faith, whereby a man believes without doubting the particular concurrence of God with him, to bring to passe some extraordinary effect, beyond the ordinary power and activity of natural causes. <HI>Iudas</HI> and other Reprobates may have such <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Mat. 7.22, 23.</NOTE> faith, and yet be rejected of Christ at last, as <HI>Workers of Iniquity.</HI> 3. It is not <HI>an imaginary faith,</HI> whereby a man may imagine that Christ is his, his state good, &amp;c. without any due Scripture-ground for it, himself mean-while continuing in his meer carnal state, bringing forth no fruits of faith.

whereby a formal Hypocrite <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Luk. 8.13. with Mat. 13.20, 21.

<P><HI>Affirmatively,</HI> It is onely the true <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Jam. 2.14 Mar. 16.16</NOTE> <HI>saving faith in Christ,</HI> the true <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Rom. 5.1</NOTE> <HI>justifying faith,</HI> that will sufficiently fit and prepare a man for the Lords Supper, which may be thus described, what it is;</P>
<P><HI>True saving faith is a grace of the regene|rating Spirit, whereby a man knowing and assenting to the truth of Gods Record touch|ing Christ, accepts him upon his own termes for salvation.</HI></P>
<P>In this description of faith consider, <HI>the ge|nerall nature,</HI> and <HI>the special difference of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Generall Nature</HI> of it, wherein it agrees with all true saving grace, is expressed in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e words; <HI>True saving faith is a grace of the regenerating Spirit.</HI> See this proved. Faith is Gods gift; <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Eph. 2.8.</NOTE> <HI>By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God.</HI> A grace of the Spirit; <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Gal. 5.22</NOTE> <HI>The fruit of the spirit is love, &mdash; goodness, faith.</HI> And also a grace of the Regenerating Spirit; &mdash; <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Joh. 1.12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>Them that believe on his Name, which were born, not of blood, nor of the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</HI> So
<PB N="112" REF="68">
that believers are regenerate persons, and be|lieving originally flowes from Regeneration, and <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Joh. 3.5.</NOTE> Regeneration is the work of the Spi|rit.</P>
<P><HI>The special difference,</HI> whereby Faith is di|stinguished from all other saving graces, is in these words; <HI>whereby a man knowing and assenting to the truth of Gods record touching Christ, accepts him upon his own terms for salvation.</HI> Herein are expressed the three graduall acts of faith, <HI>viz. Knowledge, Assent,</HI> and <HI>Application. 1. Know|ledge,</HI> which is the first and fundamental act of faith. We must know Gods Record be|fore we can assent to it, we must assent be|fore we can apply. Faith is sometimes there|fore expressed by knowledge, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Isa. 53.11</NOTE> <HI>By his know|ledge shall my righteous servant justifie many</HI>; that is, by faith in Christ, whereby we know him: it is by faith that we are justified. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Joh. 17.3</NOTE> <HI>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI> 2. <HI>Assent</HI> to the truth of Gods Record touch|ing Christ. This Act is the same with Histo|ricall faith, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 5.10, 11.</NOTE> <HI>He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son. And this is the Record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</HI> The whole Scripture is Gods book of Record touching Christ, that he will save sinners by him, that will be|lieve in him. 3. <HI>Application</HI> of Christ, when
<PB N="113" REF="68">
after knowledge and Assent a man accepts Christ upon his own terms for salvation. The applying Act, is accepting or receiving of Christ. To receive Christ is to believe: <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Joh. 1.12</NOTE> <HI>To as many as received him, gave he power to become the Sons of God, to them that believe on his name.</HI> The manner of this applying and accepting Christ is upon his own termes, <HI>viz.</HI> Self-deni|all, bearing the Crosse, and following Christ, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Luke 9.23.</NOTE> <HI>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Crosse daily, and follow me.</HI> The end of this accepting Christ, is for salvation by him. &mdash; <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10.39.</NOTE> <HI>That be|lieve to the saving of the soul,</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Acts 16.31.</NOTE> <HI>Believe on the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be sa|ved,</HI></P>
<P>This now is that true saving faith, fitting them that have it for worthy receiving of the Lords Supper.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How needful this true faith is to wor|thy communicating.</HI> This saving faith is ne|cessary before communicating, 1. <HI>For due qua|lifying of our persons and actions.</HI> 2. <HI>For discer|ning Christs body, and other Sacramental myste|ries.</HI> 3. <HI>For applying Sacramental mysteries dis|cerned.</HI> 4. <HI>For enabling duely to walk afterwards.</HI> And doubtless no one grace is more absolute|ly necessary in all these respects for the Lords Supper then this <HI>Faith</HI> is, which is as a <HI>Queen among the graces.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. For due qualifying of our Persons and Actions. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.6</NOTE> <HI>Without faith it is impossible to please
<PB N="114" REF="69">

<P N="2">2.

Faith is that <HI>acute spiritual sense,</HI> whereby a Communicant can taste and relish Christ crucified in the Lords Supper.</P>
<P>Faith is tha <HI>spiritual Prospective,</HI> by which the soul can behold Christ sweating drops of clotted blood in the Garden, suffering many cruel things in the High-Priests Palace, and dying a painful, shameful, and cursed death, betwixt two theeves upon <HI>Mount Calvary.</HI> And further, faith can read and discern many <HI>strange Mysteries in Christ crucified,</HI> of high concernment to Christians, both in the Lords Supper, and in his whole life, <HI>viz.</HI> The effi|cacy, sweetness, victories, triumphs, satisfa|ctions, expiations, purchases, priviledges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of his Crosse for our sakes.

Faith can discover these mysteries, when all carnall reason, wit, and policy cannot discern them.</P>
<P N="3">3. For applying sacramental mysteries dis|cerned. As faith is the spiritual eye, whereby we discern Christ crucified, and the mysteries of his death in the Lords Supper: so faith is the spirituall hand, whereby we <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 1.12. with 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.</NOTE> take Christ tendered in the Elements: The spiri|tuall mouth and stomack, whereby we eat and digest Christ received. <HI>Take ye and eat, take ye and drink.</HI> What must we <HI>take, eat and drink</HI> in this Ordinance? <HI>Answ.</HI> Not onely bread and wine: these, the least matters.

See if thou hast such a faith. <HI>Partly</HI> by these ensuing properties and qualities of faith.</P>
<P N="1">1. True saving faith notably softens, sup|ples, and melts the heart. It thawes and dis|solves the most stony, hard, adamantine spirit into streams and floods of penitential sorrow. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Zach. 12.10, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll pour upon the house of</HI> David, &mdash; <HI>the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="70">
[there's faith] <HI>and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his onely son; and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitternesse for his first-born. In that day shall there be a great mourning in</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>as the mourning of</HI> Hadadrimmon, <HI>in the valley of</HI> Megiddon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Spirit of grace shall make men look upon Christ by faith, as <HI>Israel</HI> looked upon the type of Christ, the brazen Serpent in the wil|derness: and <HI>looking</HI> shall melt them, make them <HI>mourn.</HI> How mourn? Mourn with a witness for their sins, whereby they pierced Christ; <HI>They shall mourn; they shall be in bit|terness; there shall be a great mourning; As for an only Son; As for a first-born</HI>; as for that peerelesse King <HI>Iosiah, in Hadadrimmon.</HI> Em|phaticall expressions!</P>
<P>Naturally mans heart is closed up as a com|pacted Rock of Flint or Marble: <HI>Faith</HI> comes as another <HI>Moses,</HI> smites this Rock, and brings forth Rivers of waters. <HI>Faith</HI> brings the soul to Christ crucified, sets him, as it were with <HI>Mary,</HI> under his Crosse in <HI>Goltho|tha</HI>: makes him view the transcendent an|guish, agonies, bitterness and torments of his sufferings, and all this for our sins; his, thy, my sins in particular. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Isa. 53.5.6.</NOTE> <HI>For he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our in|iquities, &amp;c. &mdash; The Lord hath made to meet on him the iniquities of us all.</HI> &mdash; <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5.21.</NOTE> <HI>He was made sin for us who knew no sin.</HI> Oh how this strikes to the believers heart! How this
<PB N="118" REF="71">
makes him sigh with Christ, lament with him, smart with him, bleed with him, cry out with him, &amp; as it were die with him! nothing melts the heart so kindly, as faith looking on Christ pierced for our sins particularly. Here faith reads the intolerable sinfulness of sin, that could not be expiated but at so dear a rate. <HI>Here</HI> in Christs sufferings, faith reads the sin|ners doom: If this befell the surety, what was due to the principal? If sin imputed be so plagued, what might have been expected for sin inherent? <HI>If this be done to the green tree, what would have be fallen the dry? Here</HI> faith reads the boundless Ocean of Gods matchless love in Christ: What? such a God, give sitch a Jewel as his only Son, to such a death, and that for such worthless, loveless, hopeless, godless sinners? <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Joh. 15.13.</NOTE> <HI>Greater love then this hath no man.</HI> &mdash; Oh <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Eph. 3.17, 18.</NOTE> <HI>the breadth, and length, and depth, and height of Christs love passing knowledge!</HI> Oh how do these and like conside|rations of faith pierce the heart, break the spirit, imprint contrition, and overcome the soul!</P>
<P N="2">2. True saving faith having pierced the heart, purifies the heart: <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Act. 15.9.</NOTE> <HI>Purifying their hearts by faith.</HI> Faith cleanses not only the outward, but the inward man; not onely the actions, but the fountain of those actions, the heart and affections; washes not onely the outside, but the inside of the cup and platter; makes a man forbear not only outward grosse
<PB N="119" REF="71">
acts of sin: but inward imaginations, and im|pure inclinations to sin. A true believer as truly makes conscience of, and laments for the vileness of his heart and thoughts in the sight of God, as the enormity of his life and actions in the sight of men.</P>
<P>But how doth faith cleanse and purifie the heart? <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. By <HI>Augmentation</HI> from the word against sin, which discerns the odious|ness and danger of sin. How shall I do this wickedness which God so forbids and abhors? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In this respect the Word hath a sancti|fying efficacy. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Joh. 17.17.</NOTE> <HI>Sanctifie them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</HI> 2. <HI>By application</HI> of Christs blood and death. Christs blood is that <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Zech. 13.1.</NOTE> <HI>Fountain opened for sin, and for unclean|nesse to wash in.</HI> And faith is that hand which puts us into this Fountain, applies Christs death, and <HI>makes us</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Phil. 3.9.10.</NOTE> <HI>conformable there|unto.</HI> That as Christ died for sin; so we die to sin. 3. <HI>By inward efficacy and operation.</HI> Faith is not only an Instrument of Justifica|tion, but an eminent <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Gal. 5.22.</NOTE> part of <HI>Sanctification</HI>: and so doth of its own nature purge out sin, as wine works out the Dregs, Honey, the Drosse; or as fire purifieth unwholsome aire.</P>
<P>Shew now thy faith by thy purity. A <HI>faith|full soul cannot have a foul heart.</HI> As that soul that by faith looks upon Christ pierced for his sins, cannot chuse but be wounded and pierced with Christ: so that soul that's pier|ced
<PB N="120" REF="72">
for piercing Christ by sin, cannot but aban|don and abhorre all those sins for which Christ was pierced. Faith having <HI>endeared</HI> the heart to Christ, <HI>embitters</HI> the heart against sin. Sin being the <HI>Iudas</HI> that betrayed Christ, the <HI>Pilate</HI> that condemned him, the Crown of Thorns, nails, and spear that pierced him.</P>
<P N="3">3. True saving faith makes a man sincerely obedient, and fruitful in good works. This is a duty charged upon the faithful; <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Tit. 3.8.</NOTE> <HI>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have be|lieved in God, might be careful to maintain good works.</HI> This is an intrinsecal property of faith, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Gal. 5.6.</NOTE> <HI>To work by love</HI>: and <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Rom. 13 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</HI> therefore the nursing-Mo|ther of all good works: And that faith that is <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Jam. 2, 17.20.26.</NOTE> <HI>without works is dead, as a body without a soul.</HI> A <HI>workless</HI> faith is a <HI>worthless</HI> faith. And this the faithful in all ages have practi|sed: the <HI>alacrity</HI> of their obedience, hath born witness to the integrity of their faith; as in that <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. through|out.</NOTE> <HI>cloud of witnesses.</HI> Try now thy faith by thy gracious works and sincere obedi|ence.</P>
<P>But how shall I discover the truth of my faith by mine obedience? <HI>Answ.</HI> Make tryal in these particulars. 1. Doth faith make thee so obedient to the Word of God, that it makes thee faithfully to cleave to the sincere and powerful Ministery of it, though mock|ed,
<PB N="121" REF="72">
despised, opposed by the wicked multi|tude?&mdash; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Acts 17.32, 34.</NOTE> <HI>Some mocked,&mdash;howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed.</HI> 2. Doth faith make thee set upon the strangest and hardest tasks, when imposed by God? As <HI>Noah</HI> upon buil|ding of his <HI>Ark,</HI> which he was one hundred and twenty years in building. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.7.</NOTE> <HI>By faith</HI> Noah <HI>being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear prepared an Ark.</HI> 3. Doth faith incline and bow thine heart so unto o|bedience, as to make thee deny thine earthly friends, outward priviledges, and carnal affe|ctions, rather then foregoe thine obedience? <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.8, 9, 17.</NOTE> Abraham <HI>through faith so obeyed God,</HI> as to leave his own Countrey <HI>and follow God, not knowing whether he went,</HI> yea as to <HI>offer up his</HI> Isaac, <HI>his onely begotten Son.</HI> 4. Doth faith make thee perform all thine obedience to God sweetly, chearfully, lovingly; loving God, his commands and his obedience? <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gal. 5.6.</NOTE> <HI>Faith work|eth by love.</HI> Faith puts upon all duties, and services to God in love, without whimpering or murmuring.</P>
<P N="4">4. True saving Faith wonderfully loosens and unglues the heart of a Christian from the world and all earthly felicities. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.9.</NOTE> <HI>By Faith</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob <HI>sojourned in the Land of Promise, as in a strange Countrey, dwelling in tents.</HI> It had been much, patiently to sojourn in a strange Land: but to so|journ in the <HI>Land of Promise, as in a strange Countrey,</HI> was excellent. They had not fixed
<PB N="122" REF="73">
Houses, but moving Tents. They were not dwellers, but sojourners in their own inheri|tance: because in and beyond <HI>Canaan.</HI> Faith eyed and expected <HI>Heaven. By Faith</HI> also <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.24, 25, 26.</NOTE> <HI>Moses,</HI> though a great Courtier in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>the supposed son of King</HI> Pharaoh's <HI>Daugh|ter,</HI> yet <HI>preferred suffering affliction with Gods people beyond enjoying the pleasures of sin for a season.</HI> And <HI>esteemed the reproach of Christ greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iches then the treasures in Egypt.</HI> How did <HI>Moses</HI> esteem <HI>Christs riches</HI>: that so e|steemed <HI>Christs reproaches?</HI> And no wonder that Faith thus disobligeth the heart from the World. For Faith beholds in Christ the Co|venant and promises, Treasures beyond ten thousand Worlds, Redemption, Righteous|nesse, Adoption, Holinesse, Communion with God, Co-operation of all things for good; yea in summe, Grace and Glory: and upon view thereof, how easily doth she slight and despise honours, riches, pleasures, gold, silver, houses, lands, and all such low, muddy, perishable, un|satisfying things! How self-denyingly doth she desire them, use them, and part with them when there is occasion? Doth thy faith thus make thine heart sit loose from the world?</P>
<P N="5">5. True saving faith is a quickening, en|livening Grace: yea, the very life of a Christi|an. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Rom. 1.17.</NOTE> <HI>The just shall live by his faith,</HI> &mdash; And <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Gal. 2.20</NOTE> <HI>The life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God</HI>! As the body lives by the Soul; So the Soul lives by
<PB N="123" REF="73">
Faith; Faith by the Promise and by Christ the marrow and kernel of the Promise. But of this <HI>life of Faith elsewhere.</HI> Dost thou live by Faith?</P>
<P N="6">6. True Faith is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tended with Sense of its own infirmity, with a Spirit of Prayer, and with Divine Peace. 1. With a true Sense of its own infirmity. This made the man in the Gospel say; <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Mark 9.24.</NOTE> <HI>I believe, Lord, help min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unbe|lief.</HI> And the Apostles say; <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Luk. 17.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>Lord&punc; increase our faith.</HI> Its a sign of life to be sensible of weaknesses: the dead body feels no infir|mity. Art thou sensible of thy doubts, &amp;c. 2. With a Spirit of Prayer. Believing in God, puts upon praying to God. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Psal. 116.10.</NOTE> <HI>I beleived there|fore have I spoken.</HI> Contrariwise, No Faith; no Prayer. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Rom. 10.14.</NOTE> <HI>How shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed?</HI> Canst thou <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Rom. 8.26.27.</NOTE> <HI>pray with groans that cannot be uttered?</HI> this argues true Faith. 3. With a Divine Peace: Faith justifies us, Justification pacifies us. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Rom. 5.1.</NOTE> <HI>Being justified by faith, we have peace with Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> But <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Isa. 48.22.</NOTE> <HI>there is no Peace, saith the LORD, to the wicked.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. True saving Faith is mightily puissant and victorious. It fetches strength from Christ, and conquers all a believers spiritual enemies 1. Faith conquers the world. The world fights against us with the Smiles of Prosperi|ty, and with the Frowns of Adversity. Faith overcomes both. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 5.4.</NOTE> <HI>This is the victory that o|vercometh the world, even our Faith.</HI> 2. Faith
<PB N="124" REF="74">
conquers the flesh. For, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Act. 15.9</NOTE> <HI>Faith purifies the Heart.</HI>&mdash; <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 3.2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>Every one that hath this hope in him|self, purifieth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m self even as he is pure.</HI> Now Faith and Hope are Twin-graces, and act a|like. 3. Faith overcomes the Devill. We are commanded to <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 5.9</NOTE> <HI>resist the Devil, stedfast in the Faith.</HI> And for our encouragement herein, we have this Promise; <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Jam. 4.7</NOTE> <HI>Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.</HI> Yea <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Eph. 6.16. <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> <HI>Faith</HI> is the Chri|stians <HI>Buck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er and Shield</HI> [<HI>A Shield like a door</HI> that will shelter him from top to toe,] <HI>where|by he quencheth all the fiery darts of the Devill.</HI> Satans sudden temptations are his <HI>fierie Darts:</HI> Faith quenches them all in Christs blood, which is the Christians Apology against all temptations and accusations whatsoever.</P>
<P N="8">8. True saving Faith upholds the believers spirit from sinking and fainting under heavi|est pressures and extremities of trouble. The Lord propounds this to the Jewes as a support against the Babylonish 70. yeers Captivity, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Hab. 2.4.</NOTE> <HI>That the just should live by his faith</HI>; and this was to uphold them under all. <HI>Iob</HI> was in a deep Sea of calamities, and yet in midst of all, as it were li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts up his head above the waves, with this triumphant expression; <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Job 13.15, 16.</NOTE> <HI>Though he Slay me, yet will I trust in him.&mdash;He also shall be my Salvation.</HI> And again, after a dole|full recapitulation of his miseries, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Job 19.25, 26, 27.</NOTE> <HI>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin wormes destroy this body, yet
<PB N="125" REF="74">
in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for my self, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another, though my reins be consumed within me.</HI> Yea Faith is of such masculine strength, that it makes believers even <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Rom. 5.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>Glory in Tribulation:</HI> Yea enables them to endure <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.35.</NOTE> <HI>tortures, not ac|cepting of deliverance.</HI> We read of Martyrs, so farre upheld by Faith, as to smile at the Pri|son-doors, sing in chains, kisse the stake, em|brace the faggots, and triumphantly clap their hands in flames, as having gotten the victory.</P>
<P>What support and stay now hath thy faith yeelded thee in thy plunges and extremities? Canst thou <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Psal. 8.17</NOTE> <HI>wait upon God though he hide his face from thee?</HI> Canst thou say with <HI>Paul</HI>? <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4.8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>Troubled on every side, but not distressed: Per|plexed, but not in despaire.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Finally, True saving Faith is daily grow|ing, and constantly persevering. Faith lives; but because its life is imperfect, it stil <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 10.15.</NOTE> grows and increaseth. It is said that <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Rom. 1.17.</NOTE> <HI>the Righteous|nesse of God is revealed in the Gospel, from Faith to Faith.</HI> That is, as Faith grows more and more capacious and quick-sighted, so Gods righteousness is more and more discovered to it. The Apostle commends his Thessalo|nians, and thanks God for this; That, their <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">2 Thes. 1, 3.</NOTE> <HI>Faith groweth exceedingly.</HI> And faith so growes, as that it perseveres. It's <HI>fails not.</HI> It <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10.39.</NOTE> <HI>draws not back to perdition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 22.32.</NOTE> but believes to the saving of the soul.</HI> It makes <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Rev. 2.10</NOTE> <HI>faithfull to the death, and so the believer receives the crown of
<PB N="126" REF="75">
life.</HI> If thy faith grow and persevere, that's true Faith indeed. False Faith is like the pi|cture of a man on a wall that growes not: and like a blazing-star, it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Luk. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.13.</NOTE><HI>continues but for a time.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. REPENTANCE is another Grace that fits us for worthy communicating. Examine thy self therefore, whether thou hast true Re|pentance or no, before thou communicatest. To this end consider, 1. <HI>The Necessity of it.</HI> 2. <HI>The Nature of it.</HI> 3. <HI>The Notes of it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Necessity of Repentance</HI> to fit for worthy communicating, appears divers wayes.</P>
<P>For 1. No duty can be performed acceptably to God by impenitent sinners. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Tit. 1.15</NOTE> <HI>Vnto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure: but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</HI> Hence the Lord so <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Isa. 1.11. to 29. <HI>See also</HI> Isa. 66.3. Psal. 66.18.</NOTE> abhorred all the Jewes Religious performances, because <HI>their hands were full of blood.</HI> But withal added, <HI>Wash ye, make ye clean, put away the evill of your do|ings, cease to do evill, learn to do well</HI>: (here's Repentance,) <HI>Come and let us reason together, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow, &amp;c.</HI> here's Acceptance. Vpon this consideration, <HI>David</HI> saith,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Psal. 26.6</NOTE> I <HI>will wash mine hands in innocency, so will I compasse thine Altar, O LORD.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Purging of <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Exod. 12.</NOTE> <HI>leaven out of their Houses,</HI> and cleansing themselves from all <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Numb. 9.6. &amp; Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 6.21.</NOTE>Ceremo|nial defilements, was a necessary Preparative of the Jewes under the Law before they did
<PB N="127" REF="75">
eat the <HI>Passeover</HI>: So proportionably the purging of <HI>the old leaven</HI> of sin out of our hearts by Repentance is as necessary a Prepa|rative of Christians under the Gospel before they eat the Lords Supper. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5.7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Christ our Passe|over is sacrificed for us. Therefore let us keep the Feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickednesse: but with the unleavened bread of Sincerity and Truth.</HI> All this time of the Gospel, is as a continued Feast and Christian Passeover: and this whole time is to be managed holily and sin|cerely; much more the duties of Religion. And some observe, that the <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Exod. 12.8. <HI>Ainsw.</HI> in Ex. 12.8</NOTE> sowr herbs, wherewith the Passeover was to be eaten un|der the Law, did not onely point out the bit|ternesse of Christs suffering our true Passe|over, but also the bitternesse of our sorrow, mortification and repentance for our sins the cause of Christs sufferings.</P>
<P N="3">3. When we come to the Lords Supper, which is the token of the<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11 25.</NOTE>New Covenant, or New Testament, we come to renew Cove|nant with God in Jesus Christ, and to set to our Seal. Therefore it's convenient and ne|cessary we renew our Repentance for all our unfaithfulnesses and failings against our Co|venant with God from time to time. Thus of the necessity of Repentance before Commu|nicating.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The nature of Repentance</HI> may be set forth in this brief <HI>Description</HI> of it.

This is to be truly sensible of sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hast thou true Contrition of heart, and
<PB N="133" REF="78">
godly sorrow for sin thus discovered?</HI> Art thou so sensible of thy sins, as that thine heart, is broken with sighs and sobs, and thine eyes run down with tears? who can aright dis|cern his sins, and refrain from sorrows?</P>
<P>Thou sayst, I mourn for sin: but how may I know that I mourn aright, and that my sor|row is not carnal, but godly sorrow? <HI>Answ.</HI> Thou mayst discover the truth of thy godly sorrow for sin, by these particulars. 1. True godly sorrow is sincere. It is for sin, as it is sin, especially. More for the sinfulnesse of sin, then for the dangerousnesse of sin. Hence the godly mourning soul is most wounded for offending God, and piercing Christ by sin. For offending God; So <HI>David,</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Psal. 51.4</NOTE> <HI>Against thee, thee onely have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.</HI> He had sinned also against <HI>V|riah,</HI> shedding his blood: against the <HI>Church,</HI> giving them offence and cause of mourning: against the <HI>enemies of God,</HI> giving great oc|casion to them of blaspheming: and against his <HI>own soul,</HI> wounding it with all this guilt, and doubtlesse he mourned for all these; but nothing so stabbed him to the heart, as that he had offended against such a God. For piercing Christ by sin. This also most deep|ly pierceth the soul of him that mourns for sin. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Zech. 11.10, 11.</NOTE> <HI>They shall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, and be in bitternesse for him, &amp;c.</HI> for <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Isa. 53.5.6.</NOTE> <HI>He was wounded
<PB N="134" REF="79">
for our transgressions, &amp;c.</HI> What (thinks the bleeding soul) were my sins the <HI>Iudas</HI> that betrayed him, the <HI>Pilat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> that condemned him, the nails, spear, and thorns that pier|ced him, the gall and vineger given him to drink? him that so loved me as to pray, sigh&punc; weep&punc; bleed, and die for my redemption&punc; Weep bitterly for this, oh my soul, let thine eyes run down with floods of tears. 2. True godly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orrow is great: the greatest sorrow in the world. Hence it's called, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h. 12 10, 11, 12.</NOTE> <HI>A Mourning as for an onely son: being in bitternesse, as one that's in bitternesse for his first-born: A great mourning, as the mourning of</HI> Hadadrimmon <HI>in the valley of</HI> Megiddo: <HI>A mourning</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ille dolet ver&egrave;, qui sine teste dolet.</HI></NOTE> <HI>apart.</HI> All this to shew that godly sorrow for sin is beyond all worldly sorrow. When <HI>Peter</HI> wept for his sins, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Matth. 26.75.</NOTE> <HI>he wept bitterly.</HI> True, there may be such a sudden push of worldly sorrow for a wife, child, &amp;c. that may seem greater then godly sorrow: but this sorrow lasts not like godly sorrow. So godly sorrow is great|est <HI>intensively,</HI> for degree; or <HI>extensively,</HI> for continuance. A land-flood may have a greater stream for present, than a Spring: but the Spring sends forth more waters, because it's still arunning. 3. True godly sorrow is peni|tential, it never leaves a man till it reform him of his sins. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 7.10</NOTE> <HI>Godly sorrow worketh re|pentance not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</HI> Try now, is thy sor|row such a sorrow? Is it <HI>sincere</HI>? more for
<PB N="135" REF="79">
offending God, and wounding Christ, then for any other respect. Is it <HI>transcendent</HI>? thou canst mourn more for sin then any worldly occasion. Is it <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nitential</HI>? it hath never left thee; till it hath reformed thee. Doubtlesse this is true godly sorrow indeed.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hast thou a true change and conversion of thine heart and life from sin to God</HI>? This is the truth and life of Repentance, when it brings us to a converting change. Vnchanged men are impenitent men. In repentance there's a double conversion and change wrought, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Of a mans Heart and Person.</HI> 2. <HI>Of his life and Conversation.</HI> His person and heart is brought to a new state. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 18.31.</NOTE> <HI>Make you a new heart and a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w spirit.</HI> His life and conversa|tion is brought to a new course; <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Rom. 6.2</NOTE> <HI>That we should walk in newnesse of life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A mans pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">son and heart is changed,</HI> when he is brought from a state of sin to a state of grace. Now a man is brought from his car|nal to a spiritual state; 1. When he is con|verted from the darknesse of sin, ignorance and spiritual misery; to the light of holinesse, knowledge, and spiritual happinesse. &mdash; <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Acts 26.18.</NOTE> <HI>To turn them from darknesse to light.</HI> &mdash; <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Eph. 5.8.</NOTE> <HI>Ye were sometimes darknesse, but now are ye light in the Lord.</HI> 2 When he is con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erted and raised from death in sin, to life in Christ. &mdash; <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Eph. 2.1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>You hath he quickned, who were dead in tres|passes &amp; sins: wherein in time past ye walked.</HI> The father said of the repenting Prodigal, <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Luk. 15.32.</NOTE> <HI>This

<P><HI>A Mans life and Conversation is changed,</HI> when he is brought from a sinfull to a graci|ous course. Now a man is then truly and effectually brought from a sinful to a gracious course of life; 1.

<P N="2">2. The Lords Supper is a sweet love-token betwixt Christ and his Church: Christ and his members. Herein they mutually seal up their reciprocal affections to each other.

<P N="1">(1.) The Amiableness and Lovelinesse of Christ, is that attractive loadstone that draws the hearts and affections of his people after him.

<P N="3"><PB N="153" REF="88">(3) Experience of Christ, or experimental acquaintance with him, enkindleth true love unto him.

<P N="2">2. The Degrees or Gradual steps by which our true love to Christ riseth, and by which it

may be tryed, are principally these three, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>A benevolent affection, or Good-will to Christ.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>A fervent desire, and longing after Christ.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>A contented Acquiescence or Delight in Christ.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Benevolent affection, or Good-will to Christ,</HI> is a first degree of love to Christ. Christs excellency and loveliness aright ap|prehended makes us have high and precious thoughts of him, and bear great good-will to him, to his Glory, to his Truth, to his cause, to his Ordinances, to his church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to have them ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anced, promoted, and exalted every where. Yea makes us content to be abased, that Christ alone may be exalted; to be dis|graced, that Christ alone may be honoured; to be eclipsed, that Christ alone may shine; to be as nothing, that Christ alone may be all. Thus <HI>Iohn</HI> Baptist testified his love and respect to Christ, when the Jews came to <HI>Iohn,</HI> and seemed to be troubled that Christ should be so followed. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Joh. 3.16.</NOTE> <HI>Rabbi he that was w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th thee beyond</HI> Jordan, <HI>to whom thou bearest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</HI> Hereupon <HI>Iohn</HI> answered, to this effect; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Joh. 3.27 to 30.</NOTE> That Christs Authority was from Heaven. That himself was not the Christ, but his Har|binger sent before him. That Christ was the <HI>Bridegroom,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> but <HI>the Bridegrooms friend, rejoycing greatly at the Bridegrooms voice.</HI> That Christ must <HI>increase</HI>: himself must <HI>decrease.</HI> That Christ <HI>coming from above,</HI> from
<PB N="156" REF="90">
heaven <HI>is above all</HI>: himself being <HI>of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth.</HI> Thus <HI>Ni|codemus</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Joh. 3.1. to 11.</NOTE> though a stranger to the mystery of Regeneration, yet having some seeds there|of sown in his heart, expresses his benevolent affection to Christ, <HI>in that he came to Iesus by n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght,</HI> acknowledging him to be <HI>a Teacher come from God,</HI> because of his Miracles. Thus <HI>Paul</HI> shewed his good will to Christ, counting <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Phil. 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 8, 9.</NOTE> all his Pharisaical excellencies and perfecti|ons losse, yea and <HI>all things but dung for the ex|cellency of the knowledge of Christ,</HI> and <HI>for the winning of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ervent desire and longing after Christ,</HI> is a second degree of true love to Christ. Love pants after enjoyment of the object beloved: so lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to Christ breaths after union to him, and more f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll communion with him. This is called <HI>love of union,</HI> as the former <HI>love of bene|volence</HI> or <HI>well-willing.</HI> Thus the Church of the Jews lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Christ, longs for his incarna|tion, and the sweet kisses of his Gospel-Do|ctrine and dispensation; <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Cant. 1 2</NOTE> <HI>Let him kisse me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is bet|ter then wine.</HI> And again; <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Cant. 8.1</NOTE> <HI>Oh that thou wert as my Brother, that sucked the breasts of my Mo|ther</HI>! that is, O that thou wert my naturall Brother, revealed in humane nature! And because her love to Christ was impatient of delay, and thirsting after full enjoyment of him in Heaven, she cries to him, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Cant. 8.14.</NOTE> <HI>Make haste my beloved, and be thou like to a Roe, on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="157" REF="90">
young Hart upon the Mountain of spices.</HI> Make all haste upon the heavenly Mountains, to come and fetch me home to thy self, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t I may ever be with the Lord. And it is the peri|phra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is of Christs lovers <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 4.7.</NOTE> that <HI>they love his appearing,</HI> they love and long for his coming to judgement. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Rev. 22.17, 20.</NOTE> <HI>The spirit and the Bride say, come&mdash;Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, Surely I come quickly.</HI> E|very true Christian answers in the desires of his soul, <HI>Amen, Even so come Lord Iesus.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A <HI>Contented Complacency, and satisfied delight in Christ enjoyed</HI> is the third and high|est degree of love to him. And as the enjoy|ment of Christ is more or lesse perfect: pro|portionably the complacency or resting satis|fied in him, is more or lesse compleat. There is true delight in Christ enjoyed in Heaven. When the Church after a desertion, found Christ again, how was she contented and sa|tisfied with him! she saith, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Cant. 3.1 2, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my Mo|thers house, &amp; into the chamber of him that con|ceived me. I charge you O ye Daughters of</HI> Jeru|salem, <HI>by the Roes</HI> &amp; <HI>by the hindes of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please.</HI> Ha|ving regained Christ, she holds him fast in the arms of her affections, she brings him into the Chambers of more intimate Communion, she forbids all disturbance to her enjoyment of him. All which expresse her Complacen|cy
<PB N="158" REF="91">
and sweet contentment in him: her rest|less desires were now stilled and satisfied. And after another desertion, finding Christ, she thus declares her acquiescence in him found: <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Cant. 5. compared with Cant. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.3.</NOTE> <HI>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine.</HI> As if she had said; Now that I have found Christ whom my soul loves, I have enough, my heart is filled brim full with him, I desire no more.</P>
<P>Hast thou now such <HI>A Good-will to Christ</HI>: Such a <HI>fervent restless desire</HI> after him, that thou mayst enjoy him: and such an <HI>Acquies|cence&punc; complacency</HI> and <HI>satisfying delight</HI> in the enjoyment of him? how can it be other then sincere love to him?</P>
<P N="3">3. Finally, the properties of true love to Christ, are the best way whereby you may ex|amine your love unto him. True love to Christ is, 1. <HI>Obediential.</HI> 2. <HI>Transcendent.</HI> 3. <HI>Breathing after more evidence and assurance of Christs love.</HI> 4. <HI>Accepting Christs rebukes.</HI> 5. <HI>Sincere. And</HI> 6. <HI>constant,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Obedential.</HI> True love to Christ, makes obedient to Christs commands in his word: yea to all his commands. Christ saith; <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Joh. 14.15.</NOTE> <HI>If ye love me keep my Commandments.</HI> And again, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Vers. 21.</NOTE> <HI>He that hath my Commandments, and keep|eth them, he it is that loveth me.</HI> And farther; <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Joh. 15.10.14.</NOTE> <HI>If ye keep my Commandments, ye shall abide in my love: even as I have kept my Fathers Com|mandments, and abide in his love. &mdash; Ye are my friends, if you do whatsoever,</HI> I <HI>command you.</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="91">
What Child can truly love his Father, what Servant his Master, &amp;c. but he will be obedi|ent to him? What Christian can truly love Christ, but he will chearfully and universally obey Christ? <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 Col. 5.14.</NOTE> <HI>The love of Christ constrains us,</HI> saith the Apostle. Both Christs love to us, and our love to Christ, compel us with a sweet force, that we obey him, and cannot chuse but obey him. Dost thou thus obey Christ and keep all his Commandments? then thou tru|ly lovest him. But contrariwise they who are not obedient and subject to Christ, are farre from loving Christ indeed. Christ counts <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Luk. 19.14.27.</NOTE> <HI>them his enemies, that would not have him to raign over them.</HI> And saith; <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Job. 14.24.</NOTE> <HI>He that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Transcendent.</HI> True love to Christ tran|scendeth and surpasseth all other love. The love of Father, Mother, Wife, Son, Daughter, Brother, Sister, yea and of a mans own life al|so, must give place to this love of Christ. Christ must be loved above them all: yea, all they must be <HI>hated in comparison</HI> of Christ. Christ himself saith; <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.37.38.</NOTE> <HI>He that loveth Father or Mo|ther more then me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth Son or Daughter more then me, is not worthy of me.

And
<PB N="160" REF="92">
whosoever doth not bear his Crosse and come af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> me, cannot be my Disciple.</HI> Not that we must <HI>properly</HI> hate our allies and li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">: but <HI>compara|tively</HI> we must hate them: That is, we must love them lesse then Christ.

<P N="3">3. <HI>True love to Christ, breaths after more as|surance and evidence of Christs love to the Soul.</HI> They who dearly love Christ, long to have Christs love more confirmed, sealed, and manifested to them. A true taste thereof is so sweet and pleasant: they desire a full draught. A glimps of it is so delectable they desire still a fuller view, and manifesta|tion.
<PB N="161" REF="92">
The more they love Christ, the more they desire to be loved of Christ. And they have a kinde of holy jealousie, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Christ should not love them so as they desire. Love is a greedy affection, still covering after more love, thus the Church saith to Christ, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Cant. 8.6</NOTE> <HI>Set me as a Seal upon thine heart, as a Seal upon thine arme; for love is strong as death, jealousie is cruel as the grave; The coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</HI> Here's her request: and the reason of it.

Neh. 9.38 Rom. 4.11</NOTE> <HI>Sealing</HI> is for ratification, confirma|tion, or sure making of any thing. <HI>Setting the Church as a Seal upon Christs Heart and Arm,</HI> seems to imply a confirming and stablishing of her in Christs <HI>inward</HI> affection, and his <HI>out|ward</HI> expression or manifestation thereof to her. This probably alludes to the High Priest of old, who did <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Exod. 28.11, 12, 21&punc; 29.</NOTE> <HI>bear the names of Israel, engraven on Stones upon his heart and shoulder, for a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">morial before the Lord.</HI> She de|sires that she may be deeply engraven in Christs heart, in Christs love; and may be as|sured hereof also by the expression of his lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to her. Here's her request. The reason of her request is drawn from the vehemency of her love to Christ, ready to overcome her as death: to swallow her up as the grave: and to con|sume her, as a burning flame: if Christ do not support and comfort her with his love, bring her closer to his heart, and manifest
<PB N="162" REF="93">
his affection to her. She should even die and perish through love, if she might not be be|loved. Dost thou thus long to be <HI>set as a Seal upon Christs heart and arm,</HI> through thy love unto him?</P>

<P N="1">1. He that truly loves not his Brother&punc; that truly lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es not a Christian, is a meer carnall man. For he is in his natural darkness&punc; and walks therein.

that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</HI> Now he that is a meer carnal man, in his carnall darkness, spiritually <HI>dead in sin, A mur|derer, without eternal life abiding in him</HI>&punc; Can|not possibly perform any true service unto God: And consequently, not rightly receive the Lords Supper; which is to be managed with more then ordinary abilities. God tells the Jews, that all their duties and solemn ser|vices were abominable to him, because <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Isa. 1.15.</NOTE> <HI>their hands were full of blood.</HI> And <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Rom. 8.8</NOTE> <HI>They that are in the flesh cannot please God.</HI> Wherein can they not please him?

<P N="2">2. No gifts or duties, though never so ex|cellent in themselves, are of any consequence at all in the sight of God without brotherly love. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>Though I speak with the tongues of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n and of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gels, and have not charity, I am becom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as sounding brasse, or a tinkling Cymbal.

the poor. And though I give my body to be burn|ed, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</HI> Here he instanceth in three sorts of eminent gifts; tongues, prophecy, and faith of mira|cles: and in two sorts of most admirable acts or duties, greatest liberality to the poor, and even martyrdom it self for the truth, yet all these nothing without charity to the Bre|thren. So proportionably, the receiving of the Lords Supper, though never so often, is no|thing without brotherly love. Remarkable is that of our Saviours to this effect, having re|proved unbrotherly affections and words, as a kinde of murder; <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Mat. 5.23, 24.</NOTE> <HI>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembrest that thy Brother hath ought against thee: leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, first be re|conciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</HI> Christ makes no reckoning of the most <HI>religious actions</HI>; if there be not true <HI>brotherly affections.</HI> Therefore he requires bro|therly love and reconcilement first to be en|deavoured, before sacrifice to God be present|ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Lords Supper is a Sacramental Seal and Token not only of our Communion with Christ, but also of our Communion with his members, of our fellowship with the Saints. This the Apostle clearly intimates, saying, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>For we being many are one bread, and one bo|dy: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</HI> That is, we that partake that one bread in
<PB N="168" REF="96">
the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Supper, made up of many grains of Corn: are mystically one with each other in Christ, though we be many. We all are but one bread, though many grains: one body, though many members. Such is our Vnion and Communion with one another, con|firmed in this Ordinance. Now without true brot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erly <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Col. 3.14</NOTE> <HI>Love which is the bond of perfect|nesse</HI> among Brethren, we shall but deal hy|pocritically in the Lords Supper, professing Vnion and Communion with the Brethren, to whom we have no true love, which is the bond of this Vnion and Commu|nion.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Lords Supper was ordained to con|firm unto us Gods remission of our sins un|to us in Christs blood. For in the instituti|on Christ saith of the Cup, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>This is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</HI> That is, this wine in the Cup is a signe and seal of my blood of the New Testament, shed for obtaining re|mission of sins to many, even to all the Elect. So that Christs blood and remission of sins purchased thereby, are signified and sealed to us in the Lords Supper. Now we cannot have Gods pardon of our sins sweetly and com|fortably by this Ordinance, or any other assured to our Consciences, unless we have true brotherly love, and exerci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e it also in forgiving one another our trespasses, and mutual injuries that may fall out. Vpon

But if ye forgive not men their tres|passes, neither will your Father forgive your tres|passes.</HI> And Christ farther shews in an eminent Parable to this purpose, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Mat. 18.23. to the end of the Chapter.</NOTE> That if we forgive not to one another our small debt of an hun|dred pence, we cannot expect that God will remit our great debt to him of ten thousand talents.</P>
<P N="5">5. Finally, to come to the Lords Supper, without true brotherly love, with divided, un|charitable, unbrotherly hearts, is most un|suitable and disgraceful both to Christ and his Supper. <HI>To Christ,</HI> because he is one, and u|nites all his Members to himself as head, and to each other as fellow Members, in one my|sticall body: <HI>To the Lords Supper</HI> also, for that's a bond of our Vnion and Communion with Christ, and with one another as his members. Now how can we draw neer to Christ this <HI>uniting Head,</HI> or to the Lords Sup|per this <HI>uniting Ordinance,</HI> without brotherly love and union; but we crosse and dishonour both? In these respects true brotherly love is necessary before we communicate, to fit for worthy receiving. And therefore it is ne|cessary we try and examine before-hand our <HI>Brotherly love.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="170" REF="97">2. The Trial of our true Brotherly love fol|lows.

<P N="1">1. True Brotherly Love ariseth from, and is accompanied with our true love to God. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 5.1</NOTE> <HI>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him</HI>: That is, he loves the godly for Gods sake, the spiritual Child for the Fathers sake.

<P N="2">2. True brotherly love is pure. It's seated
<PB N="171" REF="97">
in, and flowes from <HI>a pure heart:</HI> an heart <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Act. 15.9</NOTE> <HI>purified by faith</HI> justifying, and by the <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 6.11.</NOTE> spirit sanctifying. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1.22.</NOTE> <HI>Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit, unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart.</HI> So that a car|nall unsanctified man can never, so remain|ing, truly love the brethren. An impure car|nal heart can afford no other then impure car|nall affections.</P>
<P N="3">3. True brotherly love is spiritual. It is carried to Gods people in spiritual, not in carnal respects. To love Gods people for their greatness, wealth, beauty, wisdom, learning, friendliness, kindred, and like carnal conside|rations, is but to love them carnally; a Re|probate may so love them. True love respects them spiritually, and for spiritual considerati|ons, <HI>viz.</HI> It loves them,</P>

<PB N="172" REF="98">
them. This evidenceth the spiritualness and truth of our love. What may we think of them then, that most of all hate Gods people for their godliness, graces, &amp;c?</P>
<P N="2">2. As Brethren in Christ. There's a spiritu|all <HI>Brotherhood</HI> in Christ, wherein all his members relate to one another as Brethren, Christ being <HI>the first-born among many Bre|thren.</HI> Now we have true love to the Bre|thren, when we love them as Brethren, for their brotherhood. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 2.17.</NOTE> <HI>Love the brotherhood,</HI> &mdash; <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 3.8</NOTE> <HI>Love as Brethren.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As fellow-members. The Apostle at large shews, that all the members of Christs mysti|call body are also <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12.12. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>fellow-members to one ano|ther</HI> And that they are so placed in Christs mystical body, that they all have a mutuall dependence upon, and need of one another. Hence from this relation of member-ship, he urged a double act of member-like love, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. Mutuall member-like caring for one ano|ther. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Vers. 25.</NOTE> <HI>The members should have the same care one for another,</HI> being mutually aiding and as|sisting to one another, though never so mean: as the eye or hand will stoop down, to help the foot that's wounded or pained. 2.

Is thy love to the brethren such a spiritu|all love in these spiritual notions &amp; considera|tions? 4. True brotherly love is universal: To one Christian, as well as to another, to all as well as to any, whether rich, poor, bond, free, male or female. <HI>Philemons</HI> love was commen|ded by <HI>Paul,</HI> that it was <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Philem. Vers. 5.</NOTE> <HI>towards all Saints.</HI> And upon the same ground, the <HI>Colossians</HI> love was matter of <HI>Pauls</HI> thankfulness to God; <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Col. 1.3.4.</NOTE> <HI>We give thanks to God,&mdash;Since we heard of your faith in Christ Iesus, and of the love which ye have to all the Saints.</HI> And no wonder; for he that loves one person truly for godliness and grace, he will love every person, wherein grace or godliness appears; those most, that discover most grace. For the like cause will produce the like effect. Those then that have the love of the brethren with respect of per|sons; that love the rich Saints with their <HI>gold Rings, and gay Cloathings,</HI> but not the poor Saints with their <HI>vile raiment, &amp;c.</HI> they deal not sincerely in their love. For Christ is as truly precious and amiable for substance, in one Christian as in another.</P>
<P N="5">5. True brotherly love is sincere. The command is, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Rom. 12.9.</NOTE> <HI>Let love be without dissimula|tion.</HI> The practice according to this command was in these to whom <HI>Peter</HI> writes, who had

<P N="1">1. By the reality of it. True brotherly love is not meerly verbal and complemental, in words and shows; but real and substantial, in deed and truth, The <HI>Hebrews</HI> not only loved the Saints, but loved them really. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Heb. 6.10</NOTE> <HI>God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of Love, which you have shewed towards his name, in that ye have ministred to the Saints, and do minister.

good, they exercise not <HI>brotherly love,</HI> but <HI>self-love.</HI> The world is full of this coun|terfeit love.</P>
<P N="6">6. True brotherly love is kindly affection|ed. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Rom. 12.10. <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> <HI>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.</HI> The word here rendred, <HI>kindly affectioned,</HI> is very emphatical, and original|ly signifies that dear natural affection that is betwixt Parents and Children: as also the lo|ving of that affection. It is as much as, <HI>Be lo|ving-kinde.</HI> Now this <HI>Loving-kindness,</HI> or <HI>kinde affectionateness,</HI> discovers it self divers wayes, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. In courteousness, the Apostle urging divers Acts and expressions of bro|therly love, saith, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 3.8 <GAP DESC="foreign"> tanquam <GAP DESC="foreign"> qui sa|pit amica h. e. stu|det facere ea que al|teri amica sunt. <HI>Pisc. in loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>be courteous.</HI> The Greek word here used, seems to intimate such a sweet disposition, as studies and endeavours things grateful &amp; acceptable to Gods people, and to render it self well-pleasing to them. Contrary unto which is churlishness, crabbid|ness, and crookedness of disposition. 2. In compassionateness. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. 1 Pet. 3.8.</NOTE> <HI>Be pittiful.</HI> Or as the Greek may more exactly be rendred; <HI>Easily compassionating.</HI> Or, <HI>Easily moved to bowels of compassion.</HI> This implies both a compassio|nate disposition, and a quickness, easiness to that compassion. When the heart beholding the distresses of brethren is tender over them, quickly moved and melted towards them, presently bleeds over them. 3. In bear|ing one anothers burdens. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Gal. 6.1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>Bear ye one ano|thers burdens.</HI> &mdash; The Apostle having
<PB N="176" REF="100">
exhorted spiritual ones to restore a man over|taken in a fault, with the spirit of meekness: presently adds this of <HI>bearing one anothers bur|dens.</HI> He seems to intend the slips and frail|ties, even among the spiritual, which are a <HI>burden</HI> to them. They must help one another to <HI>bear these burdens,</HI> not by encouraging them, countenancing or conniving at them, this were to burden them more: but by help|ing them to get rid of their burdensom cor|ruptions, by wise, kind, meek, loving reproofs, admonitions, instructions, exhortations, ha|ving tender compassion over them.</P>
<P N="7">7. True brotherly love is best contented in the godly society of the brethren. <HI>David</HI> was a <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpanion of all them that feared God and kept his Commandments.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Psa. 119.63.</NOTE> He counted the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ps. 16 3.</NOTE> <HI>Saints the excellent on earth: in them was all his delight.</HI> Such as truly love the godly above all people, desire to live with the godly above all people. Contenting Society is hardly dissembled: But such as are weary of the company of the gra|cious, and delight more in the Society of the carnal, they are strangers to true brotherly love. 8. True brotherly love is or ought to be servent. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1.22.</NOTE> <HI>See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.</HI> And <HI>Iohn</HI> intimates so fervently, as if need require, not only to part with our goods to the brethren, but when we have a just call, to part with our lives for the brethren. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 3.16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>Hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us: and we</HI>

Sect. 5.</NOTE> <HI>ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</HI> This is the highest expression of love: this is fervent love indeed, &amp; fervent love may have many inferiour degrees. Generally there is such coldness and frozen-heartedness to|wards Gods dear children, that it's evident, there's little true love to them in the world.</P>
<P N="9">9. Finally, True brotherly love is constant and continuing, &amp; so ought to be.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Heb. 131</NOTE><HI>Let bro|therly love continue</HI>&mdash;, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13.8.</NOTE> <HI>charity never faileth</HI>; but whether there be Prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease, &amp;c. True love is not like <HI>Ionas</HI> his Gourd, suddenly springing, and as suddenly dying: but like Cedar or heart of Oak long|lasting, yea ever-living. Love of the brethren will continue till death, yea &amp; beyond death in heaven. Then the Saints shall love one an|other perfectly without all disaffection or corruption; and they shall joyntly be swallow|ed up in the love of God to all eternity.</P>
<P>Thus try the truth of thy brotherly love. And having found it in thy self, abound and persevere therein. This it that which the A|postle so pathetically urgeth upon his <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Phil. 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>Phi|lippians,</HI> and in them upon us. This that excel|lent Grace which he so commends above all gifts to the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13.1. to 9.</NOTE> <HI>Corinthians.</HI> And this is that which Christ himself so earnestly commends to his Apostles, as the very badge and charac|ter of his Disciples. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Joh. 13.34.3.</NOTE> <HI>A new Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I

<P N="6">VI. THANKFVLNES is a farther quali|fication, necessarily required to fit and prepare us for worthy receiving of the Lords Supper. And touching which consequently we are to examine our selves. Here understand that thankfulness which peculiarly respects C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rist, his Death, his new covenant, and his Supper. Now consider, 1. <HI>The Necessity.</HI> 2. <HI>The Discovery of this thankfulness.</HI> 1. The necessity of true thankfulness for Christ, his death, his new Covenant, and Sacrament pe|culiarly, to fit us for worthy rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ving of the Lords Supper, is evident upon these grounds.</P>
<P N="1">1. Thankfulness was used and expressed by Christ at his institution of the Lords Supper; <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Luk. 22.19, 20. &amp; 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.</NOTE> <HI>And he took the bread and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you; This do in remem|brance of me. Likewise also the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p after sup|per, saying, This cup is the new Testament in my blood which is shed for you.</HI> That he gave thanks is clear. What was the <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Some think that Heavenly Prayer in Joh. 17. was the Prayer which Christ used <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|stituting the Lords <HI>S.</HI> 1. Partly f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om the suitable|ness of the matter of it. 2. Partly from the agreeable|ness of the time of it. s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Joh. 18.1.</NOTE> matter or form of his thanksgiving, is not evident. Yet it's most likely that Christ who did all things properly, gave thanks with reference to the Action in hand, <HI>viz.</HI> not onely for the outward Elements, but especially for the in|ward
<PB N="179" REF="101">
mysteries to be represented by them, that now his death approached, wherein his body was to be broken, &amp; his blood shed for the life of the world, for the nourishment of his Elect, which he delighted to accomplish. And the Lords Supper from Christs giving thanks at the institution, is denominated by the Greek Fathers <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>The Eucharist</HI>; That is, <HI>The Thanksgiving.</HI> It being the Chri|stians eminent <HI>Thank-offering.</HI> Now if Christ gave thanks at the first institution: proporti|onably we are still to give thanks in all after-Administrations of the Lords Supper, especi|ally because Christ saith, <HI>Do this,</HI> in reference to the whole Action.</P>
<P N="2">2. The matter of the Lords Supper emi|nently calls for thankfulness, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The In|ward matter signified and sealed, <HI>Christ body and blood</HI>; That is, Christ crucified, together with all the vertues, benefits, victories, Pur|chases and Priviledges of his Death. This the inward matter and mystery of the Lords Sup|per. Oh wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> matter of thankfulness is this! Think how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ellent Christ is, Gods <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Joh. 3.16</NOTE> <HI>onely Son,</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Col 1.13</NOTE> <HI>The Son of his love,</HI> yea <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Joh. 1.1. Phil. 2.6.</NOTE> <HI>God</HI> him|self; therefore farre beyond ten thousand worlds. Think what his death was! Such a death, as (all things considered) never was endured: wherein malice of men, rage of all the powers of darkness, the wrath of God &amp; <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Isa. 53.6.</NOTE> sins of all the Elect did meet in him at once. And think what we worthless sinners
<PB N="180" REF="102">
gain by this Death of Christ? What pardons, Reconciliation, Peace with God, &amp;c. And all these confirmed to us in the Lords Supper, that lasting Monument of Christ crucified: Oh what manifold cause of thankfulness is here: 2. The outward matter of the Lords Supper, <HI>viz.</HI> the Elements of <HI>Bread and Wine,</HI> toge|ther with the actions of <HI>taking, blessing, break|ing, giving, eating and drinking them</HI>; affords also much cause of thankfulness, that Christ would thus condescend to our weakness, as to represent such heavenly mysteries to us by such homely elements and actions. He deals herein with us, as once with doubting <HI>Tho|mas,</HI> makes us (as it were) thrust our finger into the print of his nails, that we may be|lieve, helps our inward graces by our out|ward senses.</P>
<P N="3">3. The ends of the Lords Supper are such, that they notably challenge manifold thank|fulness from us, whensoever we partake the Lords Supper. These ends are; The solemn <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Luk. 22.19. 1 Cor. 11.26.</NOTE> remembrance of Christs Death, never to be forgotten: The <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.20.</NOTE> nourishing of the in|ward man, of faith and all our graces: The <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.28.</NOTE> confirmation and application of the New Te|stament with all the Promises thereof to us: The Ratification of the <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.28.</NOTE> pardon of our sins in Christs blood. And the sealing up unto us that sweet priviledge of <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 16.17.</NOTE> Communion with Christ and with one another. Not one of these but deserves much thankfulnesse;
<PB N="181" REF="102">
How great thankfulness then is due for all of them together in the Lords Supper?</P>
<P N="2">2. The Tryal of our thankfulness, which is thus necessary for worthy communicating, comes next to be considered: and we may try the truth of our thankfulness, by the three eminent Acts or degrees of thankfulness, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Notice-taking or acknowledgement of bles|sings received.</HI> 2. <HI>Estimation of mercies receiv|ed and acknowledged.</HI> 3. <HI>Retribution or render|ing again for mercies received, acknowledged and esteemed.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Notice-taking</HI> or <HI>acknowledgement of be|nefits received,</HI> is a first degree or Act of thank+fulness. Till a man take notice of a benefit; and whence it comes, he can neither esteem it, nor render again for it as he ought. Thus when <HI>David</HI> would express his thankfulness to God for enabling him and his people to offer so willingly and liberally towards the building of the Temple, He takes notice of the benefit and whence it came, even all from God alone; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 29.13, 14, 16.</NOTE> <HI>Our God, we thank thee, and prayse thy glorious name. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</HI> And in the Hebrew phrase, <HI>Giving of thanks,</HI> is most usually expressed by, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ps. 105.1. and 106.1. &amp; 107.1. &amp; 136.1. and fre|quently in the B. of Psalms.</NOTE> <HI>Confessing to the Lord.</HI> For confessing and acknowledging what good we receive, and whence we have it, is a prime point of thankfulness.

<P N="2">2. Dost thou esteem Christs Death, The Mystery of the Lords Supper? Christ is the matter, but how? Christ as crucified, as <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.24.</NOTE> <HI>Broken,</HI> as slain for us: in that respect Christ is the matter, his Death therefore is the My|stery of it.

<P N="3">(3.) Finally, doest thou aright esteem the Lords Supper it self? It deserves high estima|tion: 1. For the mysteries in it: <HI>Christs death</HI> and all the benefits of it: The <HI>New Covenant</HI> and all the promises of it: <HI>Communion with Christ,</HI> and all the comforts of it. 2. For the familiarity of it. Herein Christ deals famili|arly with his members. He stoops to their senses below, that their senses may lift up their faith to him above. He represents high|est mysteries under meanest elements and a|ctions. Thus he <HI>condescends</HI> to our <HI>earthliness</HI> that we may <HI>aseend</HI> to his <HI>heavenlinesse.</HI> 3. For the Firmnesse of it. In right use, the Lords Supper doth as surely signifie, seale, and exhibit Christ crucified and all his bene|fits to us, as we partake the outward ele|ments; there being such a Sacramental uni|on betwixt signes and things signified. Do these and like considerations raise up thy thoughts to an high estimation of this Ordi|nance?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Retribution, or rendring again according to the benefit received, acknowledged and esteem|ed</HI> is the third and highest act or degree of thankfulnesse. When <HI>David</HI> was most enlar|ged
<PB N="188" REF="106">
unto thankfulnesse, he saith, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Psal. 116.12.</NOTE> <HI>What shall I render unto the Lord, for all his benefits to|wards me?</HI> And because King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> reco|vered of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">knesse at his prayer, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">2 Chro. 32.25.</NOTE> <HI>ren|dered not again according to the benefit done unto him, therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon</HI> Judah <HI>and</HI> Jerusalem. If non-rendring be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o dangerous, then how dangerous is it to render to God evil for good;</P>
<P>But what can we, or ought we, to render a|gain for Christ, for his Death, for his Sup|per, which are the eminent benefits that im|mediately call for thankful returns or ren|drings when we communicate? <HI>Answ.</HI> What should we not render again for these bene|fits? All we can render is farre too little. We should r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nder.</P>
<P N="1">(1) Triumphant praises. Thus <HI>David</HI> resol|ved to render; <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ps<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 116.13.</NOTE> <HI>I will take up the cup of sal|vations, and call on the name of the Lord.</HI> That is, I will take up the Cup of Thanksgivings for Gods salvations and deliverances; and will pray and praise God, or preach abroad Gods mercies. For <HI>Israel</HI> offered for mercies recei|ed Thank-offerings, eating thereof with joy before the Lord, and in their eating were wont to take up the Cup of wine, and blesse God; to this custome <HI>David</HI> alludes. In like sort we should be much in Praises and Thanksgivings for Christ, his death, &amp;c. As <HI>Paul</HI> notably <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1.11, 12, 15.16, 17.</NOTE> thanks Christ, not only for calling him to the Apostolical Ministery, but
<PB N="189" REF="106">
also and especially for coming into the world to save sinners, and himselfe chief of sinners, making him a pattern of his grace, to all that after should believe.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Indeared affections. Christ pardons the womans many sinnes; this was one fruit of his Death. Hereupon <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Luk. 7.37 38, 47.</NOTE> <HI>She loved him much,</HI> and testified the same by <HI>washing his feet with her teares, wiping them with the hairs of her head, kissing them,</HI> and <HI>anointing them with oyntment</HI>; She hath nothing too good, no|thing good enough for Christ. Hath Christ <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Gal. 2.20</NOTE><HI>loved thee, and given himself for thee,</HI> lea|ving this Sacrament, as a legacy of his love? Oh how should'st thou love him again, that thus loved thee first.</P>
<P N="3">(3) True hearted repentance and reforma|tion. Christ came into <HI>Zacheus</HI>'s house to dine with him, yea rather into <HI>Zacheus</HI> his heart, there spiritually to feast his soul: presently <HI>Zacheus</HI> the Arch-publican penitentially reformes; <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Luk. 19.2, to 11.</NOTE> <HI>Behold, Lord, the halfe of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourefold.</HI> And Christ testifies, <HI>This day is sal|vation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is the sonne of</HI> Abraham. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul</HI> was a most cruel <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1.12. Acts 26.9, &amp;c. &amp; 9, 1, 2, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Persecuter</HI> of Christ and his Members, as even himselfe testifies: but Christ no sooner appears to him in his circuit of persecution, and converts him, but he wonderfully re|formes.<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Act. 9.20.</NOTE><HI>He straightway preached Christ in the
<PB N="190" REF="107">
Synagogues, that he is the Sonne of God.</HI> Of a Persecutor he becomes a Preacher of Christ and his Gospel. This was a thankful return indeed. Thy true thankfulnesse for Christ and his death, will make thee render to him the like repentance and reformation.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The life of faith and new obedience, is another thankful returne for Christ and his death. <HI>Paul</HI> apprehending that Christ <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Gal. 2.20.</NOTE> <HI>lo|ved him, and gave himself for him; lived by fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th.</HI>&mdash;yea not so much <HI>he, as Christ lived in him.</HI>&mdash;Yea Christ being <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Gal. 1.15 16.</NOTE> revealed in him, how immediately obedient was he in that ex|traordinary ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice of preaching Christ a|mong the Gentiles, <HI>not consulting with flesh and blood</HI>! and this new obedience is the re|turn that Christ expects from us, for giving himself for us. That we <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Rom. 6.4. &amp;c. <HI>with</HI> Rom. 14.7, 8.9.</NOTE> <HI>should neither live, nor die to our selves, but to the Lord, who there|fore died, rose again, and revived for us, that he might be Lord both of quick and dead.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Performance of vows and promises is another thankful returne. When <HI>David</HI> had questioned with himself, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Psa. 116.12, 14.</NOTE> <HI>What shall</HI> I <HI>ren|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er to the Lord, &amp;c?</HI> He answers himself pre|sently, <HI>I will pay my vows unto the Lord.</HI> We all of us have the vows of God upon us, ac|cording to the tenour of the New Covenant, confirmed by Baptisme and the Lords Supper, Therein we promised to become Gods Peo|ple, and to walk as Children of our heavenly F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther, as members of Christ, as Temples of
<PB N="191" REF="107">
the Holy Ghost, being baptized into their name.</P>
<P N="6">6. Finally, a willing chearful readiness, if we be called thereto, to suffer for Christ, who so willingly suffered for us. Christ spared not his blood for us, nor should we spare our blood for him. Vpon this account <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Act. 20.23, 24. &amp; 21.13.</NOTE> <HI>Paul counted not his life dear unto him.</HI> &mdash; Yea he was <HI>ready, not only to be bound, but also to die at</HI> Jerusalem <HI>for the name of the Lord Ie|sus.</HI></P>
<P>These are suitable returnes for the great benefits of Christ and his death. Try now whether thou canst and dost render such Praises, Affections, Reformation, Life of Faith, and New Obedience, Performance of Vows, and (i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> need be) Sufferings for Christ and for Righteousnesse sake. Thus examine thy <HI>Thankfulnesse.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. A SPIRITVAL APPETITE to this heavenly banquet, and to Jesus Christ there|in, is the next and last <HI>Communion qualifica|tion</HI>; touching which we are to examine our selves before communicating. By <HI>spiritual ap|petite,</HI> I understand that spiritual hunger and thirst, those holy desires, vehement pant|ings, breathings &amp; longings of soul after these heavenly dainties, and especially after Jesus Christ therein.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Necessity of this spiritual Appe|tite</HI> before we come to the Lords Supper, is evident. For,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="192" REF="108">1. This Sacrament is a blessed feast, and spiritual banquet. It is called <HI>A Supper.</HI> yea <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.20.</NOTE> <HI>The Lords Supper.</HI> Christ is the <HI>Master</HI> of the Feast: and Christ is the <HI>Matter</HI> of the Feast. His precious body is here tendered as <HI>bread of life</HI>: and his blood as <HI>water of life,</HI> to satisfie, strengthen, and enliven for ever every believing soul. Now a <HI>Feast</HI> and an <HI>Appetite</HI> are Relatives: and so a <HI>spiritual Feast</HI> and a <HI>sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ritual Appetite.</HI> What good doth the best Feast to him that hath no appetite? or what advantage is the keenest appetite to him that can come at no food to satisfie it? it torments him but so much the more: So here. And if ever dainties will stirre up dul ap|petites, these rarest provisions will excite spi|ritual hungrings and thirstings after them. What? feed upon Christs body, blood, me|rits, righteousnesse, pardons, purchases, vi|ctories, and all other benefits of his death? who would not long for this Supper?</P>
<P N="2">2. No small advantage will redound to us, by the sharpnesse and livelinesse of our appe|tites to this Ordinance. Hereby we shall feed upon Christ more heartily: <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.29.</NOTE> <HI>Discerne</HI> and relish him more sweetly: Be satisfied with him more contentedly: Be affected with him more joyfully and thankfully: and be migh|tily cheared up and strengthened for all sacred employments. Whereas if we come without appetites, or with dull, weak, crazy appe|tites, we shall have small or no delight in
<PB N="193" REF="108">
this banquet.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Pro. 17.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE><HI>The full soul loatheth an honey|combo, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The trial of a right spiritual Appe|tite</HI> to the Lords Supper follows. Examine it by these insuing properties.</P>
<P N="1">1. A good sharp lively Communion-Appe|tite would be often eating. Hunger bites and gnaws the sound stomack if but one meal be miss'd: The misse of this ordinance, paines and grieves the soul of an hunger-bitten Christian. The Primitive Christians had live|ly Appetites after this Supper; they desired it often, yea they had it often. <HI>Paul</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.25.26.</NOTE> once and again, intimates a frequency of their communicating. And <HI>Luke</HI> seemes to insinu|ate, that it was their accustomed manner to communicate every <HI>Lords day,</HI> which is the first day of the week;&mdash;<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Act. 20.7.</NOTE> <HI>And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came toge|ther to break bread,</HI> Paul <HI>preached unto them.</HI> Had we such hunger and thirst after Christ as they had, we should desire the Lords Supper, as often as conveniently it might be had. What weak and bad appetites have they, that can content themselves with once communicating in the year, at <HI>Easter:</HI> yea perhaps with once in five or six yeares?</P>
<P N="2">2. Such as have good appetites will be at paines and cost to obtaine food. <HI>Hunger</HI> (we say) <HI>breakes the stone walls</HI>; will make a man labour early and late, with sweat of his
<PB N="194" REF="109">
brows to get his bread, and not grudge to lay out his money for necessary sustenance. Hunger made <HI>Iacob</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Gen. 42.23. &amp; 43.13, 14.</NOTE> send his sons into <HI>E|gypt</HI> to buy bread, and at last made him wil|ling to lend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> his darling with them. <HI>Isaiah</HI> in his prophecy of Christ, saith;<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Isa. 55.1.</NOTE> <HI>Ha, every one that thirsteth,</HI> (there's appetite,) <HI>come ye to the waters</HI>: (there's paines-taking;) <HI>Come ye buy and eat; yea come, buy wine and milk</HI>; that is all variety of spiritual Provisi|ons in Christ; for to him is this invitation: (There's cost.) Consider now, what pains wilt thou be at for this Sacramental Feast; wilt thou search and examine thy self afore|hand diligently, as hath been directed? what cost and charge wilt thou be at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wilt thou sell all that thou hast to purchase that pearle? wilt thou penitentially part with all, even thy dearest corruptions, thy pride, co|vetousnesse, &amp;c. that thou mayest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a wel|come guest at this Table?</P>
<P N="3">3. He that hath a good spiritual appetite to this Feast, will be glad when Christ by his Ministers invites him thereunto. Meal-time is a gladning time to such as have good appe|tites, because then their hunger and thirst shall be satisfied. It holds both in the corpo|ral and spiritual appetite. <HI>David</HI> had many a sweet meal in Gods house, by Prayer, Hearing, and other Ordinances: therefore how was he affected, when opportunities of such refreshing were tendered! <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ps. 122.1.</NOTE> <HI>I was glad
<PB N="195" REF="109">
when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.</HI> He had a lively appetite, he was an hungry soul; that was gladned with such spiritual invitations. Hence (some think) the sound of the <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Num. 10 2, to 11.</NOTE> <HI>Silver Trumpets</HI> (which was among other uses for calling to|gether the Assemblies, and solemnity of their sacrifices) was called <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ps. 89.15.</NOTE> <HI>The joyful sound</HI>: be|cause it made them joyfull that had true ap|petites to the publick Ordinances. Now then art thou glad when the Sabbath comes, when the Sacrament approaches, when they say to thee, Come, let us go to the Table of the Lord, &amp;c? Here's a signe of a good appetite. But they that say, <HI>When will the Sabbath be gone,</HI> the Sacrament be done, &amp;c. having no kindly affectionate movings? shew their appetite is extream dull, and diseased, if any at all.</P>
<P N="4">4. A good stomach retaines and closes fast with the food received, that it may con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oct it. When the stomach returnes and casts up its morsels, there is not only no appetite, but the Party is dangerously distempered: So here, the soule that's truly a thirst for Christ, when he hath received him in the Sacrament, or any other Ordinance, how doth he clasp and close with him, that he may digest and turn him into life, blood and spirits to the inner man, by Faith, Prayers, and Meditati|on? He holds fast his death and the benefits thereof, labours to walk as one in Communi|on
<PB N="196" REF="110">
with Christ, and refreshed therewith. And charges all as the Church did once the daughters of <HI>Ierusalem</HI>; <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Cant. 2.7</NOTE> <HI>I charge you&mdash; that you stirre not up, nor awake my love untill he please.</HI> But when men presently disgorge the Sacrament, forget Christ, his Death, his New Testament and Communion with him unto which they have sealed in the Lords Supper, returning to their lusts, covetous|nesse, worldlinesse, drunkennesse, &amp;c. as soon as they have turned their backs of the <HI>Lords Table,</HI> they have no true spiritual ap|petites, but are wofully diseased.</P>
<P N="6">6. Finally, A man of a good appetite not only retains food received, but also findes strengthening, refreshment, comfort and much benefit by food retained. His hunger is sla|ked; thirst quenched, crudities expelled, faint|ing spirits revived, and decayed strength re|stored, whereby he becomes active for all im|ployments: So here, he that hath a true spi|ritual appetite to the Lords Supper, and to Christ crucified herein, he will extract and derive much spiritual strength, comfort and refreshing from that banquet. Faith and all the graces in the inner man will be nourished, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">latulencies of corruptions corrected&punc; Eviden|ces of sin's pardon, Communion with Christ, and interest in the New Testament will be farther confirmed and cleared, and spiritual strength improved for all heavenly services: That the Communicant may walk in the

<P>That thou maist rightly <HI>use and handle the Lords Supper</HI> in the <HI>Act of Communicating</HI> so as to be welcome and well-pleasing to Christ, and to reap benefit thereby to thine own soul, carefully observe and follow these few insuing Directions.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Approach to the Lords Table in an hum|ble Sense of thy Self-unworthinesse: rather then with uncharitable censoriousnesse of others.</HI> Je|sus

Christ who invites us to this Feast, is a great Lord and a Mighty King; even <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Rev. 19.19.</NOTE><HI>Lord of Lords and King of Kings:</HI> And we are but sinful lumps of dust and ashes. What self-abasing thoughts therefore should dwell up|on our hearts, in all our approaches to him? Christ was<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Mat. 11.28.</NOTE><HI>meek and lowly of heart,</HI> and loves that we should <HI>learn of him to be meek, and lowly</HI> also, that thereby we may <HI>finde rest to our souls.</HI> He <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Luk. 18.9, to 15.</NOTE> justified the <HI>self-debasing Publican,</HI> when he condemned the <HI>Self-ap|plauding Pharisee.</HI> Thou knowest worse by thy self, then by any other: have therefore mean|est thoughts of thy self, be vilest in thine own eyes, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Joh. 8.7</NOTE> <HI>cast the first stone</HI> at thy self; say with <HI>Paul,</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Eph. 3.8.</NOTE> <HI>I am least of Saints,</HI> but <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1.15.</NOTE> <HI>chief of sinners</HI>; Say with the Canaanitish woman <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Mat. 15.27.</NOTE> <HI>Truth Lord, I am a dog, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their masters Tables.</HI> Say not, this person is ignorant, that scanda|lous, that unworthy, &amp;c. but, say, Lord, I am ignorant, I am<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Luk. 7.7.</NOTE><HI>unworthy to come unto thee</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Luke 1.16.</NOTE><HI>I am no more worthy to be called thy son, make me as one of thy hired servants.</HI> The Apostles at the Supper censured not one another, but every one most suspected himself, saying, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.21, 22, 25.</NOTE> <HI>Lord, is is I</HI>?</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Propound to thy selfe, and actually level at right, not wrong ends, in Communicating.</HI> Good Ends cannot justifie a bad Action: but bad ends will corrupt and condemne a good Action: Good Ends are the crown and glory of good Actions.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="111"><HI>Come not</HI> to the Lords Supper for these wrong Ends; <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Not</HI> to make the Sacra|ment a bond of iniquity. As the bloody Pa|pists abused the Lords Supper to confirme themselves more strongly in carrying on the horrid <HI>Gunpowder-Treason.</HI> To take the Lords Supper to strengthen a mans resoluti|ons in any evil practice, is blasphemously to make Christ a Patron to our sins, and the Sa|crament a stalking-horse to our corruptions. 2. <HI>Not</HI> for Superstitious purposes; as in Po|pery, for Idolatrous Adoration of the Ele|ments, carrying them about in Procession, Re|servation of them for healing of diseases in man or beast, for casting them into dead mens graves, &amp;c. These are abominable fooleries to be abhorred, utterly besides the intention of the Lords Supper. 3. <HI>Not</HI> for Conversi|on, or breeding Grace in a gracelesse heart. True, a man may possibly be converted at the Lords Supper by the Word then opened and applied, but not be converted precisely by the Lords Supper. For this sacrament was in|tended by Christ as a spiritual Feast, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.20.</NOTE> <HI>The Lords Supper</HI>; Therefore not to convert and give life to them that are spiritually dead, but to confime and nourish them that are spiritu|ally alive: Not to breed Grace where there is none, but to feed Grace where there is. Again, Who shall be converted by the Lords Supper? either they must be Pagans from Paganisme to Christianity, or professed Christians from
<PB N="200" REF="112">
a carnal to a spiritual state in Christ; but nei|ther of these are converted by the Lords Sup|per. Not <HI>Pagans,</HI> for they are to be<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Mat. 28.18, 19.</NOTE>convert|ed by preaching the Gospel before they may be baptized, &amp; till after they be baptized they cannot be admitted to the Lords Supper. Not <HI>professed Christians,</HI> for when they come to the Lords Supper, they either come worthily or unworthily; if <HI>worthily,</HI> then they are true believers already and need no conversion: if <HI>unworthily,</HI> then they are so farre from being converted, that they eat and drink their own condemnation. 4. <HI>Not</HI> for improving of Grace where Grace is, <HI>ex opere operato,</HI> by the bare work done in communicating. The Lords Supper is not like Physick or Medicine that works a cure by a natural property there|in whether the Patient sleep or wake, &amp;c. but it is a spiritual Ordinance that through Gods blessing, in the right use of it, improves and increaseth Grace. Rest not therefore in the meer work done, but look to the well-doing of it.</P>
<P><HI>But come</HI> to the Lords Supper actually sco|ping and aiming at these right ends in com|municating, for which the Lords Supper was indeed instituted, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. For the solemne Remembring of Christ and lively shewing forth of his Death. Christ saith in the Institution in reference to the Bread, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Luk. 22.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> <HI>This do in Remembrance of me. Paul</HI> reciting the Institution, annexes this remem|brance
<PB N="201" REF="112">
of Christ not only to the Bread, but also to the Cup;&mdash;<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11, 24, 25, 26.</NOTE> <HI>Take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you: This do in remem|brance of me. &mdash; This Cup is the New Te|stament in my blood: This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</HI> And he addes, in reference to both joyntly; <HI>For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s oft as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lords Death till he come.</HI> This remem|brance of Christ and his Death therefore, is one eminent and principal End for which the Lords Supper was ordained, and is to be cele|brated.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the spiritual nourishment, support and strengthening of the inward man, Faith and all saving Graces. Hence it's called<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.20. &amp; ver. 24.25.</NOTE><HI>The Lords Supper,</HI> And in this Supper here's spi|ritual food, <HI>The body of Christ broken,</HI> and his <HI>blood shed.</HI> As also spiritual <HI>eating and drink|ing</HI> of this heavenly provision. This is an other true End and use of it: for repairing the wants, weaknesses, decayes, &amp;c. of the in|ward man, the Regenerate part in a Chri|stian.</P>
<P N="3">3. For Ratification of the New Testament or New Covenant to us.&mdash;<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.25.</NOTE><HI>This Cup is the New Testament in my blood.</HI> That is, This wine in the Cup is a Signe and Seal of my blood and death whereby the New Testament is confirm|ed. For <HI>A Will,</HI> or <HI>Testament</HI> is confirmed and becomes of force by the Testators Death. So that this Sacrament being a pledge of Christs
<PB N="202" REF="113">
Death: Ratifies to us the New Testament in Christs Death, together with all the Promi|ses, Priviledges and Comforts of the New Te|stament, as being all ours.</P>
<P N="4">4. For Sealing up to our hearts, and helping on our Assurance of the Remission of our sins. &mdash; <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.28.</NOTE> <HI>This is my blood of the New Te|stament, which is shed for many for the remissi|on of sins.</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9.22.</NOTE> <HI>Without shedding of blood is no re|mission</HI>; because otherwise Divine justice had no satisfaction. And<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10.4, &amp; 9.9.10, 12, 13, 14.</NOTE>no blood could satisfie Gods justice fully, and obtain remission of sins&punc; but the blood of Christ, God-man. Now as Christ <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Rev. 1.5.</NOTE> <HI>hath loved us, and washed us from our sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n his own blood</HI>: So he ordained this <HI>Love-token,</HI> his Supper, to assure us that as certainly as we aright partake this Sacrament so certainly our sinnes are pardoned, and our persons justified through his blood. How sweet an use is this of the Lords Supper to every soul that hath experimentally felt the bitternesse of his sins, the Wormwood and the Gall!</P>
<P N="5">5. For confirmation and increase of our Communion with Christ and him crucified. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10 16.</NOTE> <HI>The Cup of blessing which we blesse, is it not the Communion of the blood of Christ? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communi|on of the body of Christ</HI>? The double Questi|on doth eleg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntly and vehemently put it out of que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, and beyond all doubt, that the Sacramental Bread and Cup are pledges of
<PB N="203" REF="113">
our Communion with Christs body and blood, That is, with Christs Death, and with all the Benefits, Victories, Purchases and Pri|viledges of his Death: That they are all ours, as truly as this Bread we eat, and this Cup we drink, are ours. This communion of the Saints with Christ crucified, is as sweetest <HI>Honey out of the Rock,</HI> as the <HI>Tree of life in the Garden of Eden,</HI> even their <HI>spiritual Parad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se</HI> and <HI>Hea|ven on Earth.</HI> Who ever truly tasted the sweetnesse of this communion with Christ: but must highly prize, and earnestly long for this Sacramental Seale of that Communion?</P>
<P N="6">6. Finally, For testification and improve|ment of our Communion with Christs Mem|bers.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.17.</NOTE> <HI>For we being many are one Bread, and one Body: for we are all partakers of that one Bread,</HI> The Saints have not only communion with Christ as their head joyntly, but also <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 Cor, 12.12, &amp;c.</NOTE> with one another as <HI>fellow-members</HI> mutually: lo|ving, pittying, helping and taking care one of another. This reciprocal fellowship of Saints is signified, sealed, &amp;c. in the Lords Supper. As many grains of wheat make one bread and many grapes one cup of wine: So they being many me~bers yet are but all one mystical bo|dy in Christ. And therefore from this spiritual and mystical union and communion among them, sealed in this Ordinance, they ought to be more and more dear to one another, eve|ry way careful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the spiritual good of one another.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="114">These are the <HI>right Ends</HI> &amp; uses of the Lords Supper. In the <HI>Act of communicating,</HI> still keep thine eye intentively upon them: As he that shoots keeps his eie steadily on the mark or as he that runs directs his aims still to the Goal.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>In order to these excellent Ends manage the whole Sacramental Action according to Christs Institution.</HI> Sacraments are not <HI>Na|tural,</HI> but <HI>Instituted worship,</HI> and therefore wholly depend upon Institution in their Be|ing, and are wholly to be regulated by Insti|tution in their use. Bread doth not naturally &amp; in it self signifie Christs body, more then the flesh of Beasts doth: Nor wine his blood, more then water or the blood of Sacrifices doth: But by positive institution <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>wine</HI> in the Lords Supper so signifie <HI>Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sts bo|dy and blood,</HI> as no other Elements can, because these alone were instituted to that purpose. Therefore the institution must be the Rule and Standard for regulating the whole Acti|on of communicating. So Christ command|eth; <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Luk. 22.19.</NOTE> <HI>Do this,</HI> That is, <HI>Do this that I com|mand, that I do in this Institution</HI>: follow ye my Precept, &amp; my Patterne herein all-a-long. Hence <HI>Paul</HI> intending to reform the grosse abuses and prophanations of the Lords Sup|per in the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> calls them back to the first Institution thereof by Christ, from which they had turned aside, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.23, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>For I have re|ceived of the Lord, that which also I delivered unto you, &amp;c.</HI> Therefore in thy Giving, or
<PB N="205" REF="114">
Receiving the Lords Supper, keep close to the Institution: then thou walkest safely.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Elements which Christ used, were <HI>Bread and Wine.</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Mak. 14.22.23.24, 25. Mat. 26.27, 28.29.</NOTE> <HI>Iesus took Bread.&mdash;And he took the Cup, &amp;c.</HI> of which Cup he said, &mdash; <HI>I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine, un|till.</HI> &mdash; The Lords Supper therefore must not be dispensed with any other Elements then Bread and Wine. What sort of Bread or Wine, is not prescribed particularly: but left to liberty. <HI>Papists</HI> deal sacrilegiously, who deny the Cup to the people, giving them only Bread.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Mysteries signified &amp;c. by these Elements, according to Christs Institution, are <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.26, 27, 28.</NOTE> <HI>Christs Body and Blood</HI> immediately, <HI>His Death and all the benefits thereof</HI> mediately. These and no other Mysteries we are to un|derstand by the Elements. We may not de|vise other significations, then those Christ in|stituted.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Actions instituted, On Christ and his Ministers part dispensing the Lords Sup|per were, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.26, &amp;c. Mark. 14.22, 23, Luk. 22.19 20 1 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25.</NOTE> <HI>Taking, Blessing, Breaking</HI> and <HI>Giving the Bread: Taking, Giving thanks, and Giving the Cup.</HI> On the Communicants part Receiving the Lords Supper were, <HI>Receiving Eating the Bread, and Drinking the Wine.</HI> These Sacramental Actions are to be used, and no other: these alone being instituted. The Form or Manner of Christs <HI>Taking, Blessing, Tanksgiving, Breaking</HI> and <HI>Giving</HI> the Ele|ments,
<PB N="206" REF="115">
&amp;c. is not particularly described. Doubtlesse they were all most suitable and congruous to the Ordinance in hand, (Christ doing all things most exactly and properly:) And such should ours be, most proper, perti|nent &amp; agreeable to the Nature of the Lords Supper. Nor <HI>Breaking of Bread,</HI> nor any o|ther Action, may be omitted or changed. Nor may we super-adde new actions besides the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, as Sacramental and Significative; for that were to usurp upon Christs Authority of insti|tuting: therefore to adde (as some do,) <HI>The Pour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng out of the Wine,</HI> for the signification of the pouring out of Christs blood, is not only needlesse, but also unlawful. <HI>Needlesse</HI> in that Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts shedding his blood for us, and the actual separating of his blood from his body, is signified sufficiently according to the institution, otherwise: <HI>viz. Partly</HI> in the Breaking of the Bread, noting the breaking and wounding of his body, which could not be without shedding of his blood: <HI>Partly in</HI> the actual and distinct separation of the Wine from the Bread; both in <HI>Institution</HI> &amp; <HI>Distri|bution. Vnlawful,</HI> for when did Christ insti|tute this Action of <HI>Pouring out the Wine</HI>? Or where doth he require it at our hands?</P>
<P N="4">4. Finally, the Circumstantials attending upon the institution of the Lords Supper, (which were not meerly accidental and occa|sional,) They also are fit to be used by us, but not wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> opinion of the like intrinsecal
<PB N="207" REF="115">

And the Apostle makes mention of<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.21.</NOTE> <HI>The Lords Table</HI>: And of the Cup of the Lord. 2.

Such sitting be|ing more agreable to the<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Mat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6.20, &amp;c. Mark. 14.18, 22. Luk. 22.14 19.

The closing up of the whole action with some suitable Psalme, is agreeable to the Pri|mitive paterne. Thus Christ and his A|postles shut up the Lords Supper in the first Institution thereof; <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.30. Mark. 14.26.</NOTE> <HI>And when they had sung an Hymne or Psalme, they went out into the Mount of Olives.</HI> To sing Psalmes therefore in the Act of administration of the ele|ments, is clearly unsuitable to the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itable Practice of Christ and his Apostles at the In|stitution; and also evidently repugnant to
<PB N="208" REF="116">
those General Rules for Christian worship; <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 14 40, 26.</NOTE> <HI>That all things be don decently, in order, and to edification.</HI> This singing Psalmes in the a|ction being un-decent and disorderly, whilest one part of the Congregation is receiving, another part is singing, which makes a grosse confusion in the Church, and in the Religi|ous exercises. And also unedifying, yea a|gainst edification, whilest the Communicants thoughts are hereby distracted, and drawn away from fruitful pondering and medita|ting upon the many mysteries of the Lords Supper: and their graces are disturbed and hindred from their free and lively actings to|wards Christ crucified, the benefits of his death, his love therein to us, our reciprocal duties to him, &amp;c. enough to employ the quickest thoughts and graces throughout the whole action.</P>
<P>But as for those <HI>Circumstantials</HI> about the Lords Supper, that were meerly <HI>accidentall</HI> and <HI>occasional</HI>; occasioned by the Paschal Supper, or otherwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e extrinsecally in respect of the Lords Supper; As, <HI>The time,</HI> in the evening, not in the morning: <HI>The place,</HI> in a private chamber, an upper room, not in the place of publick worship: <HI>The quality of the Bread,</HI> unleavened, not leavened: <HI>The num|ber, sexe, and office of the Communicants</HI>; They being but twelve; and all these men, no women being amongst them; and all these Apostles and Ministers of the Gospel,
<PB N="207" REF="116">
there being no private Christians amongst them: These being meerly accidental to the Lords Supper, and being occasioned by something besides the Lords Supper, they do not tie us to the observation of them. Thus manage the whole action of the Lords Supper according to Christs Institution.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Act and exercising lively, in Communica|ting, all those Sacramental qualifications and graces fore-mentioned,</HI> viz. <HI>Knowledge Faith, Repentance, New Obed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence, Love to Christ and to Christians, Thankfulnesse, and a Spiritual Ap|petite.</HI> It's not enough to have these, and bring them with us to the Lords Supper, but we must use and improve them discreetly and carefully at the Lords Supper. You have seen how necessary they are for a worthy Communicant. Stir them up therefore, and awaken them in your selves in Communica|ting. He that's to wrastle or run a race, must not only have strength and skill, but use them if he mean to prevaile. He that's cold must not only have fire raked up under the ashes, but must blow it up, if he means to be warm: so he that means to communicate wor|thily, must not content himself with the ha|bit of Grace, but put forth the Acts of Grace. Gods children may receive unworthily, by not using of Grace: as wicked men receive unworthily by not having of Grace. Act and use therefore every Grace pertinently and properly according to their several natures respectively.</P>
<PB N="210" REF="117">
<P N="1">1. <HI>Act Knowledge,</HI> so as to have a right ap|prehension, <HI>Of that God,</HI> with whom thou hast to do in this Ordinance: <HI>Of thy selfe,</HI> that dost Communicate, what thy spiritual state is: <HI>Of Christ and his death,</HI> the chief my|stery of this Supper: <HI>Of the New Covenant</HI> and the tenour of it, which is sealed in this Sacrament: <HI>And of this Sacrament it selfe,</HI> and the nature of it, which thou takest in hand. Rouse up therefore thy judgement and spiritual senses to eye and discern these things truly, that so all thine other Gra|ces may be helped and quickened. Know|lede being the inlet, guide and enlivener of them all.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Act Faith,</HI> In <HI>discerning</HI> and tasting spiritually Christs body and blood, how sweet and precious nourishment they are: In <HI>as|senting</HI> to the truth of the New Covenant and all the promises thereof; to the truth of Christs death and all the benefits thereof; to the certainty of this Sacramental comfort, and that to the worthy Communicant; The bread and wine are Christs body and blood indeed Sacramentally: especially in <HI>Apply|ing</HI> the Covenant and Promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, Christ, his love, death, and all the fruits of his death particularly to thine own soul, as certainly &amp; undoubtedly as the outward elements are ap|plied to thy body.

for me.</HI> Say, as certainly as this Bread and this wine are mine: so the New Testament and all the Promises thereof are mine, pardon of sin mine; Christ and his death, with all the advantages thereof are mine, &amp;c. Thus to act faith is to eat and drink indeed, to com|municate indeed.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Act Repentance and godly Sorrow.</HI> When thou seest the bread broken, and the wine se|parated from the bread, think how Christs body was <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Isa. 53.4, 5, 6.</NOTE> <HI>wounded,</HI> and his blod shed and separated from his body, and this for thy sins. Then <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Zech. 12.9, 10, 11.</NOTE> <HI>look upon Christ</HI> by faith, <HI>whom thou hast pierced, and be in bitternesse for him</HI> by godly sorrow, <HI>as one is in bitternesse for his first borne, &amp;c.</HI> Fill thine heart with shame and confusion for those sins, and with hatred iudignation and holy revenge against those sins of thine, that cost Christ so dear, and would have cost thee damnation. And re|solve for future to abominate thy corrup|tions, as the thorns, scourges, nails, and spear, that did murder the Lord of glory.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Act New Obedience.</HI> Say to thy self, O my soul, was Christ thus <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Phil. 2.8.</NOTE> <HI>obedient to the death for thee, even to the death of the Crosse</HI>? Did he count it<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Joh. 4.34</NOTE><HI>meat and drink to do the will of him that sent him, and to finish his work?</HI> Did he <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Psal. 40.6 7, 8. <HI>with</HI> Heb. 10.51 to 11.</NOTE> <HI>delight to do,</HI> yea and <HI>to suffer the Will of God,</HI> in being sacrificed for thee? How obedi|ent then shouldst thou be to Christ! live not to the world, or to sinne, or to thy selfe, but to
<PB N="212" REF="118">
Christ, willingly do any thing he commands, forbear any thing he forbids, and bear any thing he inflicts, that Christ in all may be glo|rified.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Act Love sincerely to Christ and his Mem|bers.</HI> This Sacrament is Christs Love-token to his Church. A Memorial of his death for us, which was <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Gal. 2.20 Rev. 1.5. 1 Joh. 3.16</NOTE> his greatest expression of love to us. Behold how his love streamed forth to sinners out of every stripe and wound of head, back, hands, feet, and heart! <HI>Be|hold how he loved thee</HI>! wilt not thou love him again? warme thy frozen affections at this fire of Christs love, and melt them into reciprocal love to Christ.

There's more merit and pardon in it, then sin and misery in me. There's more Reconcilement, Redemp|tion and Justification in it, then enmity, slave|ry and condemnation in me; His person being an infinite God, I being but a finite creature.
