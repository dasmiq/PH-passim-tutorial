<HEAD><HI>A further Assertion of the Propositions concerning the Magnitude,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of</HI> London, <HI>contained in two Essays in Political Arithmetick; mentioned in</HI> Philos. Trans|act. <HI>Numb.</HI> 183; <HI>together with a Vindication of the said Essays from the Objections of some Learned Persons of the</HI> French <HI>Nation, by Sr.</HI> W. Petty <HI>Knt.</HI> R. S. S.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT could not be expected that an Assertion of <HI>Londons</HI> being bigger than <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Roven,</HI> or than <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> put together, and bigger than any City of the World, should scape uncontradicted, and 'tis expected that I (if continuing in that Perswasion) should make some Reply to these contradictions.</P>
<P N="2">2. I begin with the Ingenious Author of the <HI>Novelles de la Republique des Lettres,</HI> who saith, that <HI>Rey</HI> in <HI>Persia</HI> is far big|ger than <HI>London;</HI> for that in the <HI>6th.</HI> Century of Christiani|ty (I suppose <HI>An.</HI> 550.) It had 15000, or rather 44 thousand <HI>Moschees</HI> or <HI>Mahometan Temples.</HI> To which I reply, that I hope this Objector is but in jest, for that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was not borne till about the Year 570, and had no <HI>Moschees</HI> till about 50 Years after.</P>
<P N="3">3. The next is the excellent <HI>Monsieur Auzout</HI> from <HI>Rome,</HI> who is content, that <HI>London, Westminster,</HI> and <HI>Southwark&mdash;</HI> with the contiguous Housing may have as many People as <HI>Paris</HI> and its Suburbs; and but faintly denyeth, that all the Housing within the Bills, may have almost as many People as <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Roven,</HI> but saith that several Parishes inserted
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">
into these Bills, are distant from, and not contiguous with <HI>London,</HI> and that <HI>Grant</HI> so understood it.</P>
<P N="4">4. To which (as his main, if not only Objection) we an|swer. <HI>1st.</HI> That the <HI>London Bills</HI> appear in <HI>Grants</HI> Book to have been, since the Year 1636, as they now are. 2. that a|bout 50 Years since, 3 or 4 Parishes formerly distant, were joyn'd, by interposed Buildings, to the Bulk of the City, and therefore then inserted into the Bills. 3. That since 50 Years the whole Buildings being more than double, have perfect|ed that Union, so as there is no House within the said Bills, from which one may not call to some other House. 4. All this is confirm'd by Authority of the King and City, and so long Custom. 5. That there are but three Parishes under a|ny Colour of this Exception, which are scarce a two and fiftieth part of the whole.</P>
<P N="5">5. Upon sight of <HI>Monsieur Auzouts</HI> large Letter, I made Remarques upon every Paragraph thereof, but suppressing it (because it lookt like a War against one with whome I in|tended none, whereas in truth it was but a reconciling Ex|plication of some Doubts, and therefore) I have chosen the shorter and sweeter way of answering <HI>Monsieur Auzout,</HI> as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
