<P>_HAving intended a
painefull &amp; new
labour, upon a
rare and necessa|ry
argument, as
for al Sea-farers,
so also properly pertaining to
your Honours, my most noble
Lords; I could not but of due sa|lute
your Honours, as the kee|pers
<PB REF="4">
of Sea-lawes, for a refre|shing
remembrance, and need|full
consideration of that most
honourable estate and high of|fice,
presently, and (I hope) hap|pily
allotted unto you: I meane,
the Admiraltie of his M. domi|nions;
a charge both ancient
from many hundreth yeeres in
this Ile, and most honourable by
the personages your predeces|sors,
bearing the same: as being
all, either sonnes, brothers, un|cles,
or cousins to Princes, or (at
least) for action most famous.
With all the which, that your
Honours may the better ranke
and match, surely, as the condi|tion
of these daies craves, so the
best disposed wish, that as you be
every other way Noble, your no|bility
may be crownd with a care|full
attention to the speciall parts
of the Admiraltie requiring the
<PB REF="4">
same, to a memoriall surpassing
all ancesters: I meane the con|servacy,
jurisdiction and privi|ledges
thereof. The jurisdiction,
albeit it bee most faithfully and
diligently exercised, and name|ly
in <HI>England</HI> by Sir <HI>Daniel
Dunn,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Trevor,</HI> most
learned, sincere, and worthy col|legues,
Iudges in the high court
there: yet the daily thwarting
and curbing of the processe of
the Iudicature, urges a clearing
or designing of the limits and
marches, to a better distingui|shing
thereof from all other ju|risdictions
ordinary; without
which, due justice can neither be
administred, concerning the sea
customes (of which no court else
can take knowledge) for stran|gers
traffiquing here (importing
no small staine to the King his
justice) nor yet for his M. lieges
<PB REF="5">
traffiquers on sea, whose con|tracts
and charter-parties ordi|narily
beare the clause of ruling
by law of <HI>Olero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> a forraine law,
as all the other lawes of the Ad|mirall
court commonly are,
whereof no other Iudicature
here can take cognissance.</P>
<P>To end this point; Beside that
which God in the heavens re|quires
of the ministers of justice,
please you to remember, that
here below amongst men, <HI>Nihil
justitia popularius.</HI> Consequently
therefore, the priviledges due
for the maintenance of the Ad|miraltie
and jurisdiction there|of,
would be vindicat from all
sort of encroching and usur|ping.
But above all, the conser|vacie
(as the chiefe point of that
office) requires security and safe|ty
in common for all loyall sub|jects,
traders on Sea: specially,
<PB REF="5">
for Fishers and others, happily
disposed to adventure and exer|cise
the trade of fishing, to the
end, that not onely a peaceable,
but also a full and plentifull fi|shing
may bee enjoyed by the
inhabitants of his M. kingdomes,
even according to that which
God so freely and bountifully
offers into their very doors. For
which cause, the barbarity of the
Ilanders would be repressed, and
strangers stayed from scarring,
scattring, and breaking the shoals
of our fishes; namely, upon our
coasts of <HI>Scotland.</HI> There could
be no better employment for
some (at least) of his M. shippes

for a comfortable out-bearing

<HEAD>The Proheme containing
the Origine of the Sea-law:
with the occasion of this
Treatise.</HEAD>
<P>_COncerning the
Argument of
Sea-faring go|vernement,
so
farre as by any
monume~ts can be observed,
our beginning must be at the
inhabitants of the Iland cal|led
<HI>Rhode,</HI> situate within the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, in the
<PB N="2" REF="9">
part thereof called the <HI>Car|path</HI>
sea, upon the coast of
<HI>Asia minor,</HI> over against <HI>Ca|ria.</HI>
The indwellers where|of,
amongst all other people
we can reade of, were most
famous for shipping and
Sayling; and that not onely
to the great increase of their
power and wealth every
way, as by which they did
command and daunt all o|ther
people about their
coasts and seas; in such man|ner,
that neither Pirat, nor a|ny
sort of enemy, or distur|ber
of their peace and traf|fique,
durst then appeare<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gellius, lib. 7. Cap. 3.</NOTE>:
but also by the communica|ting
<PB N="3" REF="9">
of their trade, and disci|pline
on sea, they did make
neighbour Princes, and Ci|ties,
willingly Tributars un|to
them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Strab. geogr. lib. 12. cap. 14.</NOTE>. And further, as
<HI>Strabo</HI> writeth<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> to the crow|ning
of their renowne, they
surpassed all other Nations
in knowledge of equity in
marine businesse; which
they manifested by making
of Sea-lawes.</P>
<P>For, the very Emperors
of Rome, <HI>Tiberius Caesar,
Hadrian, Vespasian, Traian,</HI>
successively, did referre all
seafaring debates and con|troversies,
to the judgement
of the <HI>Rhodian</HI> law.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Vide Il. Rho|dior. in prin.</NOTE> And
<PB N="4" REF="10">
so likewise exemplarilie, did
their successor <HI>Antoninus,</HI> by
his rescript yet extant<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">L. deprecatio ad L. Rhod. e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> c. rhodiae leges. distinct. 2.</NOTE>:
wherein, answering to one
<HI>Eudemon</HI> his plaint, I am
(saith he) the Lord of the
world, but the law is the ma|ster
of the sea; let that thy
plaint and controversie <HI>Eu|demon</HI>
be decided by the law
of the <HI>Rhodians.</HI></P>
<P>So farre did the Romans
(who alwaies excelled all o|ther
Nations, in devising of
humane lawes) yeeld and
give place to the <HI>Rhodians</HI> in
the sea lawes.</P>
<P>And by their example,
finding sea-faring and tra|fique
<PB N="5" REF="10">
on sea, redound to a
great common wealth, as
plainly pronounced<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">L. 1. sect. licet. de exerc. act.</NOTE> <HI>Vlpian,</HI>
one of the fathers of their
lawes; the Romane Empe|rours,
and namely <HI>Claudius,</HI>
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Suet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. ca. 218.</NOTE> brought in new formes of
actions, and devised a kinde
of new and sure commodi|ties
and gaine for trafiquers;
by taking upon them the
hazard of shippe and goods:
to which end also is erected
by English lawes, the office
of Assurance.</P>
<P>It is true, that the first ma|king
of Sea lawes, is other|wise
by some attributed to
others, as by <HI>Dionysius</HI> to
<PB N="6" REF="11">
the <HI>Phenicians,</HI> because of
Merchant trade<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">De situ orbis.</NOTE>. And <HI>Pli|nius,</HI>
for that same cause as|cribes
the Art of sayling to
the <HI>Carthaginians.</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Lib. 7. natur. histor. vide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|zechiam. c. 27.</NOTE>. and con|sequently,
would seeme to
attribute to these two Na|tions
also for their necessi|tie,
the skill of sayling. To
be briefe, by the space of a
thousand yeeres, the sea, at
least the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> was
onely ruled by the <HI>Rhodian</HI>
law, but helped with some
few additions by the Ro|mans,
and that by way of
interpretation: the rather, to
occurre to the deceits and
Sophistrie of calumniators
<PB N="7" REF="11">
and wilfull vexers of their
neighbours, as also for o|ther
needfull doubts<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Dotimus in lib. suo legoli.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At last, when all sorts of
lawes by the eversion and
renting of the Romane Em|pire,
was as it were for a
long time buried, necessity
forced the Rulers of Rome,
<HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1075. to make
new sea lawes and statutes:
and so successively, every
chiefe sea-faring towne up|on
the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> coast,
to adde other ordinances;
as they of <HI>Marseilles</HI> did,
<HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1162. and they
of <HI>Genua, Anno Dom.</HI> 1186.
And they of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="12">
called <HI>Morea, Anno Dom.</HI>
1200. and the Common|wealth
of <HI>Venice, Anno Dom.</HI>
1215. And the Emperours
of Constantinople, <HI>Paleo|log.
Anno Dom.</HI> 1262. and
<HI>Constantine,</HI> 1270. and <HI>Iames</HI>
King of Aragon that same
yeere; and <HI>Peter</HI> King of
Aragon, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1340.
and they of <HI>Barcelona, Anno
Dom.</HI> 1434. which lawes
being all collected and amas|sed,
serve the <HI>Mediterraneans</HI>
unto this day.</P>
<P>But on the great Ocean,
which is our sea, the first
lawes we knew to be made,
were devised by them of
<PB N="9" REF="12">
the Iland of <HI>Oleron,</HI> situate
on the sea coast of <HI>France,</HI>
beside S. <HI>Martin</HI> against the
mouth of <HI>Charante</HI> and the
<HI>Marraes,</HI> neere to the entry
of <HI>Garumna:</HI> which are
therefore called <HI>La roold' O|leron;</HI>
as by which the con|troversies
on the sea coast
of <HI>France</HI> toward the Oce|an
were ordinarily decided,
in the towne of the said
Ile, called thereupon, <HI>Lavile
de droict,</HI> or <HI>Oleron.</HI> As
where the skilled Skippers
in that law did dwell, and
had cognition of all such oc|current
debates and questi|ons.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">
Now these lawes of <HI>Ole|ron,</HI>
were afterward transla|ted
into Dutch by them of
<HI>Wisby,</HI> for the sea use of the
Dutch coast.</P>
<P>And of late, our Kings
of <HI>Scotland</HI> made divers Acts
in Parliament, concerning
sea-faring<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Vide act. par. lia. Scot.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As also the Kings of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
have done before<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Vide statut. Ang.</NOTE>:
for <HI>Edward</HI> the third, by a
solemne inquisition of eigh|teene
most famous persons
for skill in sea-faring, assem|bled
at <HI>Quinborow</HI> from
divers parts, <HI>Anno</HI> 1375. set
downe certaine articles
concerning the Admiralty
<PB N="11" REF="13">
and sea-faring, into old
French: as may be seene in
an old parchment authen|ticke
booke yet extant;
which articles one <HI>Thomas
Roucghton</HI> of that same, tur|ned
afterward in Latine, and
intituled <HI>de officio admiralita|tis
Angliae.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise <HI>Fredericke</HI> the
second of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> in his
generall convention, at Cop|penhaven,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1561: sets
downe a compend of Sta|tutes,
for ruling of his Sea-faring
subjects; but for most
part all one with <HI>La rooled' O|leron.</HI></P>
<P>Also the French King
<PB N="12" REF="14">
<HI>Henry</HI> the third, added his
new constitutions to these
of <HI>Francois,</HI> and others his
predecessors, which are
chiefly for the authorising
of his Admiralty, Iurisdicti|on,
honour and profits ther|of;
preferring the Admirall
and his officers to all other
Iudges and Iustices, except
these called Royals.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all these
many, divers, and late Sta|tutes
and Ordinances made
and set forth these sixeteene
hundreth yeares, by the na|tions,
people, and Princes
above written, in the deci|sion
of causes, and judging of
<PB N="13" REF="14">
sea-faring controversies; that
fragment of the <HI>Rhodian</HI>
law, extant and Latinized
by <HI>Simon Shardius,</HI> intituled
by him, <HI>Leges navales Rhodi|orum
&amp; selectae Leges Rhodio|rum,</HI>
with the interpretations
and commentations, devi|sed
thereupon by the old
Romane <HI>Iurisconsults</HI> insert
in the <HI>Pandects;</HI> together
with the constitutions made
by the Romane Emperours,
contained in the <HI>Cod.</HI> and
<HI>Novells</HI> at large: as it were
by common consent of Na|tions,
obtaines the preroga|tive
throughout all <HI>Europe,</HI>
as in <HI>Great Brittaine, Ger|many,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
France, Italy,</HI> and
<HI>Spaine.</HI> Such is the force and
authority of the Civill Ro|man
Law amongst all Na|tions
Christian.</P>
<P>In which Countries, al|beit
there hath bin, and yet
remaines a great number of
professors and doctors of
the Roman civill law, who
have written largely there|upon;
yet few or none hath
taken in hand to write per|tinently
or expresly, upon
the lawes concerning sea-faring,
the traffique on sea,
and by sea, with the duties
requisite of every sea-faring
person, of all sorts and
<PB N="15" REF="15">
degrees.</P>
<P>It is true that <HI>Iulius Fer|rettus</HI>
in his observant de|voir
to the Emperour <HI>Charls</HI>
the fift, prepared a discourse
for the addressing of Navies
with convenient and expert
Governours, and all sort of
necessaries for hostility on
the sea, intituled <HI>de iure &amp; re
nautica,</HI> but farre off from
our present Argument, as
may bee seene by the same
of late published, <HI>Anno</HI> 1579.
and dedicated to <HI>Philip,
Charles</HI> his sonne, by <HI>Exupe|rantius
Ferrettus,</HI> sonne also
to the said <HI>Iulius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Petrus Pekkius</HI> also a
<PB N="16" REF="16">
Fleming <HI>Zelander,</HI> hath lear|nedly
commented upon the
titles of the civill law, touch|ing
the sea-lawes; but more
busied about the exposition
of words then of the matter.
Likewise <HI>Benvenutus Strac|cha,</HI>
in his large booke <HI>de
mercatura,</HI> interlaceth a lear|ned
title, <HI>de nautis, navibus
&amp; navigationibus,</HI> but com|meth
not close to this our ar|gument;
for he holds
straightly within the com|passe
of the civill law, pro|testing
also his pretermissi|ons
and remissions of many
chiefe matters to certaine
Doctors, who also writes but
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<HI>obiter</HI> of the sea matters, and
none speakes of the sea cu|stomes,
which is our princi|pall
argument: To the end
of which booke is annexed
an halfe sheet of paper, bea|ring
<HI>consilia Roderici Suarij
de usu maris &amp; Navibus
vehendis;</HI> a turne of small
contentment.</P>
<P>'Tis true that <HI>Simon Shar|dius,
Anno</HI> 1561. promised
this same compend and col|lect
of sea lawes forth of all
lawes (which presently by
Gods grace I intend) but by
death prevented, could not
performe it.</P>
<P>To conclude then, since no
<PB N="18" REF="17">
man, as I can understand,
hath set his pen to this my
argument and purpose, for
the due information of eve|ry
sort of sea-faring persons
in every order, whether
Commanders, Iudges, Skip|pers,
Mariners, Merchants,
Passengers, Fishers, Ferry|ers,
Watermen, &amp;c. concer|ning
their severall duties,
priviledges and powers, and
all manner of things per|taining
or incident to sea
and sea-farers; I thought
good, after the insight and
deepe consideration of all
the lawes and ordinances
aforesaid, to mend a weake
<PB N="19" REF="17">
piece of labour, which I in|tended
many yeares since,
intituled the <HI>Sea law of Scot|land;</HI>
and to frame the same
in a very harmonicall col|lection
of all sea-lawes,
And upon the conscience
of my profession of the ci|vill
law, having no em|ployment
or part in any Ad|miralty,
to publish the same
for the use of the Admiral|ties,
and benefit of all bene|volent
sea-farers; and that
presently, because of the
present use thereof so requi|ring
the same, as I now
cleerly perceive: that is to say;
Because that wheras the most
<PB N="20" REF="18">
civill, wise, and politicke na|tions,
have even most care|fully
distinguished the juris|diction
of the sea from the
jurisdiction of the land in all
respects: yet neverthelesse
some men prease alwaies,
upon what intent I wot not,
to confound the same. And
the multitude of these who
doe acknowledge the fore|said
distinction, as specially
the Mariners, through igno|rance
contemne all other
law but the rule of <HI>Oleron.</HI></P>
<P>In these respects (I say) I
have with great paine and
travell, concluded the pub|lication
of this work; which
<PB N="21" REF="18">
if it please (as I pray) God to
blesse with the owne effect,
I have reward enough.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The order of this Treatise.</HEAD>
<P>AS the affaires of the
sea concernes onely
sea-faring and med|lers
therewith: even so all
doubts, differences, and con|troversies,
rising upon the
same, and their cases must
also concerne the same
persons, which are eyther
chiefly Owners, Out-tra|ders
or hyrers, Masters,
Pilots, Mariners, Clerkes,
<PB N="23" REF="19">
Merchants, Passengers. Of
whom the owner is hee, to

pertaines in property. The

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Iudge ordinary, in sea-faring
causes, with his jurisdi|ction,
and priviledges.</HEAD>
<P>AS for the Iudge of the
Sea, wee have first to
consider, how at the
beginning of the Roman
Empire, there was a speciall
difference betwixt the per|sons
to whom the charge
of shipping was given,
and them to whom the
commandement of Fleets
<PB N="27" REF="21">
and Navies was committed;
and betwixt the persons who
exercised the jurisdiction in
sea-faring debates, as follow|eth.</P>
<P>For amongst the Romans
in the beginning, first the
builders, forth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eakers, or fur|nishers,
and preparers of
Ships and Navies with all
necessaries (by a speciall or|dinance
called <HI>Lex Decia</HI>)
were stiled <HI>Duum viri nava|les;</HI>
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Livius lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> as the Governours of
these Fleets were called
<HI>Archigubernij,</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">L. Seius Satur|ninus ad S. C. trebell.</NOTE> and the
Iusticiaries of sea-faring de|bates,
<HI>Magisteriani:</HI> even so
amongst the Grecians, the
<PB N="28" REF="22">
Commanders of their fleets
were stiled <GAP DESC="foreign">. And after
the Empire seated at <HI>Constan|tinople,
Magnus dux classis,</HI>
and <HI>Drungarius magnus,</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Vide frag|menta ascripta Polybio.</NOTE>
as the chiefe carrier of the
Pinsell or flagge. His stile
afterward was <HI>Admiratus,</HI>
from <HI>Amiras,</HI> a word of
the Sarazens, signifying
an Overseer, or a Cap|taine
on sea or on land;
for <HI>Mirar</HI> is to see, as the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> useth it. From this
word <HI>Amiras,</HI> commeth the
word <HI>Amirante</HI> to the Ita|lians
for the Leader of their
fleets, as well as <HI>L'amirag|lio:</HI>
albeit they tearme
<PB N="29" REF="22">
their sea-faring Iudges, <HI>Li
consoli del mare,</HI> and such like
from the same word Admi|rall,
which most part of the
Nations of Europe use in
the same meaning; as first
and chiefly <HI>France,</HI> where
<HI>Childebert</HI> the first, one thou|sand
yeeres sithence, in|stituted
an Admirall as Cap|taine
and Commander of
his Armie upon sea, like as
he did then ordaine a Mar|shall
for the governement of
his <HI>Gen d'armerie</HI> on land.
Onely the <HI>Spaniard</HI> called
this Leader and Comman|der
of his fleets and navies,
<HI>Adelantado:</HI> as who should
<PB N="30" REF="23">
goe before the rest.</P>
<P>Briefly, the word Admi|rall,
how ever this day it be
used or abused, for to signifie
the chiefe shippe, which was
<HI>Navis praetoria</HI> to the Ro|mans,
as the chiefe Com|mander
of the fleet; yet that
word Great Admirall, notes
properly the man whom
the Romans called <HI>Praefe|ctum
maris,</HI> and the Greci|ans,
<HI>Thalassiarcham:</HI> to wit,
the Governour of the sea.
And thus farre concerning
names and styles for the
Commanders and Guberna|tors
of ships, fleets, and seas.</P>
<P>But concerning the jurisdi|ction
<PB N="31" REF="23">
of the sea, and the
exercises of justice amongst
sea-faring men; at first a|mongst
the Romans, it was
allowed to every President
on the coasts, and afterward
other Iudges were specially
constitute at the sea sides,
called <HI>Magisteriani:</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Vide Alberic. ad novell. 17. &amp; 24.</NOTE> but
their Iudges were all coun|table
to their higher Iudge,
styled <HI>Praefectus praetorio sub|limissimus,</HI>
from whom was
no appellatio~ or advocatio~<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">L. &agrave; procon|sulibus. C. de appell.</NOTE></P>
<P>Sithence, in these latter
daies, for the readier obedi|ence
to the great Admirall
of the Sea, it is by common
consent of Nations, suc|cessively
<PB N="32" REF="24">
agreed, that in con|sideration
of the Admirals
their soveraine commande|ment,
their speciall prefer|ment,
and power upon the
lives of men within the sea
floud; that therefore they
should also have a soveraine
jurisdiction onely proper
to themselves, over all sea-faring
men within their
bounds, and in all sea-faring
causes and debates, civill
and criminall. So that no o|ther
Iudge of any degree,
at least in <HI>Scotland,</HI> may
meddle therewith, but one|ly
by way of assistance; and
that by commission and in
<PB N="33" REF="24">
difficile causes, as was found
in the action intended by

<P>In which jurisdiction, the

justice in his high Court on

<PB N="34" REF="25">
Doome-sayers, Mar|shals,

the exercising of their
said jurisdiction both in peace

to sit and hold Courts where

and to command the
Kings prisons and bor|roughs
their prisons, to re|ceive

<P>Finally, their authority
should be distinctly acknow|ledged
in all things pertai|ning
to sea-faring.</P>
<P>It is true, that in <HI>Scotland</HI>
before the erection of our
<PB N="35" REF="25">

of other Nations, the
Deanes of Gild were ordi|narily
Iudges in civill de|bates,

like as the high Iustice
was Iudge in their criminals.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of things taken upon Sea.</HEAD>
<P>NOw followeth to
treat of goods taken
upon Sea; which are
of three sorts: for either they
are taken from Pirats, and
sea-thiefes; or from professed
enemies in lawfull warfare;
or from such as not profes|sing
open warre, allowes ta|king
reft to be exercised a|gainst
us. Which kinde of
taking, is covered with the
<PB N="176" REF="96">
title of letters of Marque,
called <HI>Ius represaliarum.</HI></P>
<P>And first, touching that
which is taken from Pirats,
sith the goods which they
have wrongfully taken from
others, whether they be
found in their owne, or in
their successors possession,
are esteemed to bee a just
prey to any taker, so that
account be made thereof to
the Admirall: in case the ta|ker
finde the goods of his
country man or friend with
the Pirat, hee should make
the same forth-comming to
the just owner claiming the
same; his cost, charges and
<PB N="177" REF="96">
hazard, being alwaies consi|dered
and allowed;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Per l. Pom|ponius de acq. rei dom.</NOTE> so
that if any man buy or re|deeme
his neighbours ship
from a Pirat or enemy, hee
must receive the price there|of
from the owner.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Per l. mulier. de cap. &amp; post.</NOTE> But if
no man claime the goods
taken from a Pirat, then
should the same be delivered
to the Admirall, who ought
to consider the taker with his
due part thereof.</P>
<P>If a ship or goods be ta|ken
by a professed enemy,
who hath not brought it
<HI>in praesidia vel locum tutum,</HI>
for the making of a prescrip|tion;
or a right, and after|ward
<PB N="178" REF="97">
the same is taken back,
and recovered by any friend,
and the just owner claime
the same, it ought to be re|stored
to the owner; for that
by the law, <HI>Huiusmodi res

goods become a just and
lawfull prize to the taker,
then should the Admirall
have a tenth part: for so of
old, the tenth part of lawfull
spoile, was offered to God,
in a manner; as we may
learne by that which <HI>Abra|ham</HI>
returning from victory
over five Kings, offered to
<HI>Melchisedeck:</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Gen. 14.</NOTE> and the rem|nant
<PB N="179" REF="97">

this argument of fishing con|tained
in my former Title,
<PB N="201" REF="108">
by Gods grace, to occurre
thereunto; as manifestly di|rect,
at least (in my weake
sight) tending to the preju|dice
of my most worthy
Prince and his subjects; and
that not onely by arguments
derived from the first verity
of the nature of things, but
also from his owne proofs,
warrants, and their Au|thors.</P>
<P>And yet before I goe any
further, I cannot passe the
Authour his ridiculous pre|tence,
in both Epistle and
beginning of his Discourse;
as for a liberty onely to
saile on Seas: a thing farre
<PB N="202" REF="109">
off from all controversie, at
least upon the Ocean; speci|ally,
since passage upon land
through all Regions Chri|stian,
is this day so indiffe|rently
permitted to all of all
Nations, even to Turkes,
Iewes, Pagans, not being
professed enemies; and ther|fore
much lesse to be restrai|ned
on Sea in all respects. So
that I cannot but perswade
both my selfe, and other loy|all
subjects, that the said pre|tence
is but a very pretence;
and so much the more to be
suspected as a drift against
our undoubted right and
propriety of fishing on this
<PB N="203" REF="109">
side the Seas.</P>
<P>Now remembring the
first ground, whereby the
Authour would make <HI>Mare
I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">herum,</HI> to be a position for|tified
by the opinions and
sayings of some old Poets,
Orators, Philosophers, and
(wrested) Iurisconsults, that
Land and Sea, by the first
condition of nature, hath
beene and should be com|mon
to all, and proper to
none: against this I minde to
use no other reason, but a
simple and orderly reciting
of the words of the holy Spi|rit,
concerning that first con|dition
naturall of Land and
<PB N="204" REF="110">
Sea from the very beginning;
at which time, God having
made and so carefully to|ward
man disposed the foure
Elements, two to swimme
above his head, and two to
lye under his feet: that is to
say, the Earth and Water,
both wonderfully for that
effect ordered to the up-ma|king
of one and a perfect
Globe, for their more mutu|all
service to mans use: accor|ding
to this, immediately af|ter
the creation, God saith to
man,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Genes. 1. 28.</NOTE> <HI>Subdue the earth, and
rule over the fish:</HI> which
could not be, but by a subdu|ing
of the waters also.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="110">
And againe, after the
Floud, God saith, <HI>Replenish
the earth:</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">eod. c. 9. v. 1.</NOTE> and for the bet|ter
performance hereof,
God in his justice against the
building of Babylon, scat|tred
man-kinde over all the

<HI>These are the Iles of the Nati|ons

that hereby is evident that
things here done, are not so

is also as well author of
the division, as of the co~posi|tion:
and yet howsoeuer,
<PB N="206" REF="111">

<HI>Divus Pius</HI> did write
to the Fishers of Formian. So
that you see the Emperours
to have been warrants to
these Lawyers, and their writ|ten
opinions, concerning the
voyage of the sea.</P>
<P>Now, to passe the propri|ety
which hereby we see
these Emperours did claime
on the seas, I aske first, to
whom did the Emperours
write such resolutions? was
it not to the professed sub|jects
of their owne Empire?
and what? even the usage of
the seas, and coasts of their
<PB N="213" REF="114">
Empire, to be indifferently
common to every one of
their own subjects: and how?
<HI>Iure gentium;</HI> that is, according
to the law kept by all other
nations, to every one of their
own nation in like cases.</P>
<P>Moreover, albeit these
and other Romane Law|yers
pronounce so, concer|ning
the community of the
sea-shoare, and coast, that
private men may build hou|ses
within the floud-marke,
and appropriate them to
themselves, according to
that which <HI>Neratius</HI> writes,
<HI>Quod in littore quis aedificat,
eius fit:</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">l. quod in lit|tore. de aeq. rer. dom.</NOTE> that is, what
<PB N="214" REF="115">
a man builds on shoare, it be|commeth
his owne; yet up|on
this condition, <HI>Tamen de|cretum

<HI>Pomponius:</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">l. quamvis. de acq. rer dom.</NOTE> that is, provi|ding
the Praetor his decree

that the Prince give grant, as

of these sorts of war|rants
alledged for <HI>Mare libe|rum,</HI>
sith they sing all one
song for the common use to
the people, and propriety to
the Prince, if men will but
onely marke them; I need
not stay further upon them.
<PB N="215" REF="115">
So that every man may see
both the use of the word
<HI>commune,</HI> and the meaning of
<HI>Iure gentium</HI> among these
Lawiers, whereupon this
<HI>Mare liberum</HI> appeares so to
be founded, that it cannot
be shaken. For, <HI>commune,</HI>
there is nothing else but <HI>pub|lieum,
q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">asi populicum;</HI> signi|fying
a thing common for
the usage of any of one sort
of people, and not for all of
all nations: according to that
of <HI>Modestinus, Roma commu|nis

<P>Neither yet doth that
word, <HI>Iure gentium,</HI> meane a|ny
law set downe by com|mon
<PB N="216" REF="116">
consent of all nations;
but onely notes the example
of the law, or custome of o|ther
nations: as if they would
say, the liberty of fishing on
our seas, and of other doing
there and at shoare, should be
common to every one of the
Romane Empire, like as
the same is common to all
of all other nations,
on their seas, and their
shoares.</P>
<P>Likewise, that of <HI>Placen|tinus;
Quod mare sit in nul|lius

is, GOD is onely Lord of
the sea; and so say we with
King <HI>David,</HI> that the land

of <HI>Faber,</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Ad parag. lit|torum inst. de rer. divis.</NOTE> <HI>Mare esse in pri|maevo

to refute now, than I
have done above alrea|dy.</P>
<P>And these are the Authors
and warrants whereupon
<HI>Mare liberum</HI> inferres his
conclusion; <HI>Demonstra|tum
igit ur nec populo, nec pri|vato
ius aliquod in mare
competere posse, quum occupa|tionem,
nec natura, nec
publici usus ratio permittat.</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Pag. 28.</NOTE>
Which, how it followeth
upon the premisses, let men
judge; sith neither these
<PB N="218" REF="117">
his Authors make for him,
neither yet the reason inser|ted
in the conclusion beares
out; which is, <HI>quum occupa|tionem
nec natura, nec publici
usus ratio permittat:</HI> that is,
neither nature, nor the com|mon
need, suffers the sea to
be acquired in property to a|ny
occupation.</P>
<P>For answer, first concer|ning
the nature of the sea, as
supposed impossibly occupa|ble
or acquirable; Is this so
thought because the sea is
not so solid, as is the land,
that men may trade thereon,
as upon land? or that it is
continually flowing to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d
<PB N="219" REF="117">
fro? Surely, that lacke of so|lidity
for man his trading
thereon by foot, shall not
hinder the solid possession of
it, farre lesse the occupation
and acquiring, if we will give
to the sea, that which the Iu|risconsults
indulgently grant
to the land, which also can|not
be denied. <HI>Paulus</HI> the
Iurisconsult saith,<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">In l. possideri. de acquir. poss.</NOTE> <HI>Qui
fundum possidere velit, non u|tique
omnes glebas eius circum|ambulet,
sed sufficit quamlibet
partem eius introire, dum men|te
&amp; cogitatione hac sit ut to|tum
possidere velit usque ad
terminum:</HI> that is, it is not
needfull for him who would
<PB N="220" REF="118">
possesse himselfe in any part
of the land, to goe about
and tread over the same; but
it is sufficient to enter-in up|on
any thereof, with a mind
to possesse all the rest there|of,
even to the due marches.
And what can stay this to
be done on sea, as well as on
land? And thus farre concer|ning
the solidity.</P>
<P>As for the flowing condi|tion
of the sea, howsoever
it be liquid, fluid, and unsta|ble,
in the particles thereof,
yet in the whole body, it is
not so: because it keepes the
prescribed bounds strictly
enough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 104. 9.</NOTE> concerning the
<PB N="221" REF="118">
chiefe place and limits there|of.</P>
<P>VVhich discourse, gives
us occasion of force to an|swere
to a scoffe cast in by
the Author of <HI>Mare liberum,</HI>
concerning the possibility
also of marches and limits,
for the division of the seas:<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Pag. 38.</NOTE>
<HI>Mundum dividunt</HI> (saith the
fore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aid Authour of <HI>Mare

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed imaginaria quadam linea:
quod si recipitur, &amp; Geo|metrae
terras, &amp; Astronomi
coelum nobis eripient:</HI> that
is, they divide the world,
not by any marches,
<PB N="222" REF="119">
put either by nature, or by
the hand of man, but by an
imaginary or fantastick line:
which kinde of doing being
embraced, the Geometers
may steale away the earth,
and the Astronomers the
heavens from us.</P>
<P>It is true, that there are not
in every part of the sea Iles
sensible (as <HI>Gernsey</HI> is to <HI>Eng|land</HI>
in the narrow seas) or
sands (as the <HI>Washes</HI> at the
West seas of <HI>England</HI>) nor
rockes, or other eminent and
visible markes above water,
for the designation of the
bounds (or laying-out the
limits) of the divisible parts
<PB N="223" REF="119">
thereof: but GOD, who is
both the distributer and first
Author of the diuision and
distinction of both land and
sea, hath given an understan|ding
heart to man for the
same effect, as well as for all
other necessary actions
wherein he hath to employ
himselfe: so that to a very
wonder, God hath diversly
informed men by the helpes
of the Compasse, counting
of courses, sounding, and o|ther
waies, to finde forth, and
to designe <HI>finitum in infinito;</HI>
so farre as is expedient for
the certaine reach &amp; bounds
of seas, properly pertaining
<PB N="224" REF="120">
to any Prince or people.</P>
<P>Which bounds <HI>Bartolus</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">insect. nullius in tractat. de insula.</NOTE>
hardily extends and allowes
for Princes and people at the
sea side, an hundreth miles of
sea forth from their coasts,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Per l notio|nem de verb. Sig.</NOTE> at least; and justly, if they
exercise a protection &amp; con|servacy
so far: and this reach
is called by the Doctors,
<HI>Districtus maris, &amp; territori|um.</HI>
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gloss in c. ubi periculum. pa|rag. porro. de electionib. lib. 6.</NOTE> It is true, <HI>Baldus</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">m l. si testa|mentum. de inst. &amp; subst.</NOTE> e|steemeth
<HI>potestatem, iurisdi|ctionem &amp; districtum,</HI> to be all
one.</P>
<P>To conclude then, since
<HI>Papinian</HI> writes in <HI>finalibus
quaestionibus vetera monumen|ta
sequenda esse;</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">l. in&punc; finalibus. com. divid.</NOTE> what more
<PB N="225" REF="120">
evident monuments for our

&amp;c.</HI> And for the Eastern
seas, direct from <HI>Scotland,</HI>
what is more antiently no|torious
than that covenant
twixt Scottish men and Hol|landers,
concerning the
length of their approaching
toward <HI>Scotland</HI> by way of
fishing?</P>
<P>And thus farre through oc|casion
of answering to that
alleadged impossibility, of
acquiring the Sea by occu|pation,
because (as would
appeare) of the unsolidity
therof, for any foot treading.
<PB N="226" REF="121">
It rests to touch the other
cause naturall, for that other
impossibility, which may be
the continuall fluxe and in|stability
of the Sea; in such
sort, that it would appeare
not aye to be one and the
selfe same body, but daily
changeable. For answer, I
must remember that which
the Iurisconsult sets downe
so prettily:<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">In l propon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ur. de iud.</NOTE>, Suppose (sayes
he) a certaine Colledge of
Iudges, or a Legion of Soul|diers,
or the particular parts
of a Ship, or of a mans bo|dy,
should so continually
and often be changed and
altred, that none of that first
<PB N="227" REF="121">
Colledge or Legion could
be found alive, nor yet any
part of the Shippe or body
could be so certainly demon|strate,
that it might be affir|med
for the very same that it
was at the first; yet if that
Colledge or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">egion be in
number full, and the ship or
man whole and able in all the
frame, they shall be accoun|ted
and esteemed not to be
new, but to be the very same
which they were at the be|ginning:
even so, however
the sea many waies and hour|ly
changes, in the small parts
thereof, by the ordinary rush
on land, mixture with other
<PB N="228" REF="122">
waters, swelling in it selfe, ex|halation
and backe receipts
thereof by raine; yet since
the great body of the Sea
most constantly keepes the
set place prescribed by the
Creator, I see not in this re|spect
neither, wherefore the
nature of the Sea should not
yeeld to occupation and con|quest.
And thus farre concer|ning
<HI>Mare liberum</HI> his last
and great conclusion, against
all appropriation thereof by
people or Princes. I call it his
last great conclusion, be|cause
of other two passing
before, whereof the first is
this; <HI>Mare igitur proprium
<PB N="229" REF="122">
alicuius fieri non potest, quia
natur a iubet esse commune:</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Pag. 21.</NOTE>
and for what reason? Even
because <HI>Cicero, Virgil,</HI> and
<HI>Plautus</HI> have said so. To
whom I could also assent
concerning the great, huge,
and maine body of the sea.
His next conclusion is this;
<HI>Est igitur mare in numero eo|rum
quae in commercio non
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">unt, hoc est, quae proprij iuris
fieri non possunt:</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Pag. 25.</NOTE> that is,
The Sea to be of that order
of things, which cannot bee
appropriate to any man.
His warrants for his conclu|sion
also are the Romane
Lawyers, whom I said to be
<PB N="230" REF="123">
wrested by <HI>Mare liberum;</HI> and
therefore must shew the
same, contrary to his pur|pose
indeed. <HI>Martianus,</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">l. si quisquam divers &amp; temp. praescrip.</NOTE> as
the Authour of <HI>Mare liberum</HI>
largely grants,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Pag. 24.</NOTE> saith, that
if any private man have him|selfe
alone, by any lawfull
space of time sufficient for a
prescription, kept and exer|cised
fishing in any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">reeke or
nooke of Sea, which they
call <HI>Diverticulum;</HI> hee may
forbid all others to fish ther|in:
which <HI>Papinianus</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">l. praescriptio de usu cap.</NOTE> also
confirmeth. The which, as
I accept, so I would further
demand of him. By what
reason should a private man,
<PB N="231" REF="123">
who hath no other care nor
respect but to himselfe alone,
be thus priviledged and pre|ferred
to a Prince? who not
for himselfe; but for his peo|ple
also in common, yea and
for the safety of all traders
passing his coasts, with great
charges and care protects
and conserveth the Seas nee|rest
unto him: shall not this
Prince be acknowledged, at
least with the good which
that Sea, conserved by him,
offers so directly to him?
And I pray you say, What
lesse authority had <HI>Leo</HI> than
the rest of the Romane Em|perours,
to grant to every
<PB N="232" REF="124">
one in particular, having
possessions at the Sea side, as
much of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ea as was nee|rest
against their lands,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Novell. const. 102. 103. &amp; 104.</NOTE>
with the fishings thereof?
What then, shall not Princes
be equalled, in these cases,
with subjects? Or rather,
have not all Princes a like
right &amp; power within their
own precinct and bounds, as
these Roman Princes had?</P>
<P>But now to draw neerer to
the chiefe point of our pur|pose,
and so to the end there|of:
as I accepted <HI>Mare li|berum</HI>
his former large
graunt, so now also doe I
more heartily embrace the
<PB N="233" REF="124">
next, which is this; When

<HI>Et si quicquam eorum prohibe|re
posset, puta piscaturam, qua

say, If the uses of the
Seas may bee in any re|spect
forbidden and stayed,
<PB N="234" REF="125">
it should be chiefly for the fi|shing,
as by which the fishes
may be said to bee exhaust
and wasted; which, daily ex|perience

to be over true: for wher|as
aforetime the white fishes
daily abounded even into all

by the neere and daily
approaching of the busse Fi|shers
the sholes of fishes are
broken, and so farre scattered
away from our shores and

be found worthy of any

<PB N="235" REF="125">
of all the sort of
our home-fishers, and to the
great damage of all the Na|tion.
Whereby, I see at last,
the Author of <HI>Mare liberum</HI>
not so addict to serve any

written above of pri|viledged

which the warfare-ships
of Princes are first and
chiefe) and somewhat of the
conservacy of the Seas, in the
last title; I cannot here passe
the warfare-shippes un|mentioned,
albeit not in such
large manner and measure
<PB N="238" REF="127">
as their imployment now-a-dayes
requires. As for the
matter fit for their building,
and things necessary for
their forth-setting and pre|paration
to Sea, I must refer
the same to <HI>Iulius Ferretus,</HI>
and to <HI>Vegetius,</HI> who have
written largely thereupon.
Some touch I have here sub|joyned,
in the last Title of
this Booke, concerning the
materials: as likewise some|what
is premitted concer|ning
their priviledges, in that
Title of priviledged shippes.
Therefore would I here set
downe (but very briefly)
some thing concerning the
<PB N="239" REF="127">
Captaines, Commanders,
&amp; Companies of the Prince
his warfare-ships, the graces
&amp; vertues required in them,
with their duties, power and
preferment.</P>
<P>Captaines of Princes war|fare-shippes
should be men,
first, fearing God, because
they must continually walke
in the midst of the wondrous
workes of God. Next, they
should be stout, hardy, and
couragious. Thirdly, vigi|lant,
diligent, and carefull;
and therefore very tempe|rate
on Sea:<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ferretus.</NOTE> specially, be|cause
their imployment, as it
is full of hazard and danger,
<PB N="240" REF="128">
even so are their occasions
and opportunities sudden
and momentanie. There|fore
their commandement
and power over their com|pany,
not onely surpasseth
the power of Masters and
Commanders of private
shippes, but also that of the
Captaines on land; and
therefore their honour and
estimation every way high|er
also, because of their grea|ter
charge, care, and ha|zard.
Their duty toward
their company, is first, that
they chuse such as bee free
from hainous and scanda|lous
offences.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">per. l. 4. de re militar.</NOTE> Next,
<PB N="241" REF="128">
that they suffer none of their
company to bee idle, but to
punish as well the sluggard
as the rebellious:<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">per l. 6. eod.</NOTE> yea, e|ven
those who are irreve|rent
towards them;<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">per. l. 13. eod.</NOTE> and
againe, should with all lo|ving
care see to the due
food of their company, heare
their mutuall plaints, hold
them in peace by all obe|dience,
visit, refresh, and
with all helpes comfort the
hurt and diseased.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">per l. 12. eod:</NOTE> As
for the Captaines their other

<P>FErryers and Water|men

be compelled thereunto:<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">l. 1. &amp; l. cum navarchorum. C. de navicul. lib 10 &amp; l. liti|ca de public.</NOTE>
and most, justly, because it
was in their owne hand and
power from the beginning
to give and apply themselves
to that calling and trade, or
not. And if therefore they
<PB N="244" REF="130">
faile, it shall be, according to
the law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> a point
of dittay or inditement a|gainst
them in the first Iu|stice-court;

unto the third time,
they may be suspended from
their trade,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Iac. 3. parl. 13. c. 95.</NOTE> except they
can alleadge a just cause; as,
of feud or hostility.</P>
<P>Item, it is ordained, for
the easier boating and lan|ding
of men and beasts, that
Ferriers make, and have
ready, fit and convenient
bridges, or else to lose their

<P>But concerning their ordi|nary
fares and hires, it is
neither needfull nor expedi|ent
in this place to recite the
divers statutes made there|upon;
because that first they
are at great length set downe
in the Statutes of <HI>England</HI>

their fraughts have

that now also, according to

their portage, fraughts or

<HEAD>TIT. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Shipwrights.</HEAD>
<P>TO conclude this
Treatise, there remai|neth
a speciall sort of
persons to be considered and
respected, as the forgers and
framers of the instrumentall
causes of all Sea-faring; to
wit, Shippe-wrights, and
builders of Ships or Boats,
called by the Romans, imita|ting
the Grecians, <HI>Naupegi:</HI>
and by the Italians, follow|ing
<PB N="249" REF="132">
the latter Grecians, <HI>Cala|fatti,</HI>
as is above described;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Tit. 6.</NOTE>
and therefore subject to the
jurisdiction of the Admiral|ty
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Per diplom. admiralior. u|triusque regni.</NOTE> as accountable to the
Admirall and his Iudges) as
accessories of sea causes, for
their skill, diligence, and du|tifull
discharge in every re|spect,
by a frame not onely
likely &amp; comely, but a worke
also strong, ticht, and dura|ble:
or else they must under|goe
the pains of the law, cal|led
<HI>Lex Aquilia;</HI> that is to say,
all costs and scath happening
by their unskilfulnesse, neg|ligence,
or what-ever other
fault or amisse.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Per T. T. ad l. Aquil.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="133">
And therefore, first touch|ing
the materials, they should
not onely furnish the same
good and sufficient, but al|so,
if the furniture pertain not
to them, they must refuse to
take from the furnishers bad
and vnmeet geare and stuffe
for the worke.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Per l. 2. de naut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. &amp; per Vegetium de re militar</NOTE> As for ex|ample,
Aller, Beech trees,
and such like brickle and
naughty timber for salt-wa|ter,
or for the seas. Neither
should they put greene tim|ber
in worke; but ought to
fore-see if they can, that their
wood be cut downe either at
the wane of the Moone, and
in the deepe of Winter, or at
<PB N="251" REF="133">
such time as experience de|clares
wood to be most so|lide
and durable. For timber
cut at the contrary times, is
commonly full of moysture;
and therefore being after|ward
dryed, becomes clung,
and open to receive water.</P>
<P>The like care and skill is
required in the iron, and all
other necessaries, to the end
that the workes may prove
strong, durable, right, and
comely. This being done, it
resteth to consider their
hires and fees: which be|cause
they ordinarily depend
on the conditions agreed up|on
with the party, which
<PB N="252" REF="134">
also commonly is cavelled
withall before a full perfor|mance
of their worke, upon
surmises and quarrels; there|fore
to occurre to all such
doubts and discords, the con|tracts
of such bargaines
should be (after the example
of other seafaring dealings)
made before the Admiralls
deputy&punc; or Iudge, and regi|stred
in their bookes.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Vide sup. of the Admirall Clerke.</NOTE></P>
<P>Last of all, as Shippe|wrights
were of old,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">l. fin: C. de poen.</NOTE> so are
they also of late, forbidden,
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Vide de off. Adm. Ang.</NOTE> under paine of treason, to

Likewise, they are forbid|den
(as are also all other so|cieties
of handy-crafts-men

their wages, or

excessive wa|ges.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Vide de off. Adm.</NOTE></P>
