On second PB REF="18," added DIV1 N="1" TYPE="book" and changed DIV1s to DIV2s for chapters to accord with the structure of the rest of the text.
*Checked placement and completeness of PBs.
*Checked for damage GAPs, #s, @s, --s, &mdash;, q;s, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>  and UNCLEARs.
Replaced all "h~" with "h" since this stroke does not seem to be an abbreviation for anything or mark a missing letter.  In the two occurrences of "Ih~u" (REFs="21" and "430"), it does denote an abbreviation; these forms were rendered  ABBR Ihu / ABBR.
Changed many "z" to "&yogh;".
On first PB REF="427," ABBR placed around "Ihu".
