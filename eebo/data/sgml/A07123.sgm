<L>But this reply was made, That none dwelt there,</L>
<L>That knew what learning meant, Nor need they care</L>
<L>For he that knew, Ilgotten goods to spare,</L>
<L>And saue, was wise enough to make an Heire.</L>
<L>From hence my Muse (neglected) home doth post,</L>
<L>And (in dispaire to get a kinder Host,)</L>
<L><PB REF="16">She left her wandring veine, and did retire,</L>
<L>Againe vnto the Woods, (with new desire.)</L>
<L>Where she intends to passe her Time in griefe,</L>
<L>Till frowning Fortune smile, and send Releife.</L>

<L>THe Martin is turnd Nightingale, strange newes!</L>
<L>Enuy not little birds: his sweet tun'd Muse,</L>
<L>Warbles harmonious notes with such true skill,</L>
<L>As if <HI>Apollo</HI> did direct his quill,</L>
<L>Though yong, and scarcely fleg'd, he dares be heard,</L>
<L>Amongst old chanters, that their garlands reard</L>
<L>To <HI>Cadmus</HI> shaggy woods, be prais'd by them,</L>
<L>Whom latter times haue stil'd the wittiest men,</L>
<L>And to their number added, as for others</L>
<L>(Whose iudgements ranckle toothed enuy smo|thers,)</L>
<L>He cares not, feares not any, no, not those,</L>
<L>Whose Eastern-breaths will blast a budding Rose.</L>
<L>His blooming youth may better things produce,</L>
<L>Though this be good, yet time and longer vse,</L>
<L>Will add perfection, Now he hath done well,</L>
<L>Then in his next indeuors he'le excell.</L>
<L>But harke! he sings, silence the Titmouse fits,</L>
<L>When the shrill Nightingall so neere me fits.</L>
