<HEAD>The relation of the man buried in <HI>S. Sepul|chres</HI> new Church-yard, on Munday, be|ing the 29. of August, 1636.</HEAD>
<L>MOrtals behold here prostrate to your sight,</L>
<L>The Cities terrour, and the Countries fright.</L>
<L>The Lord hath drawn his sword, many are slain,</L>
<L>And who can tell when 'twill be sheath'd again?</L>
<L>For sinne the Plague is now among us sent,</L>
<L>Many have sinn'd, and yet but few repent.</L>
<L>The City to the Countrey now are runne,</L>
<L>Although the Countrey them so much do shun,</L>
<L>And to speak truth some Citizens poore elves,</L>
<L>By flying thither, have undone themselves.</L>
<L>Yet some have said, 'ith Countrey they are free,</L>
<L>Blind fools are they which think God cannot see</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n every place his power it self doth shew,</L>
<L>Strange things he doth, his wisedome willeth so:</L>
<L>His sword is drawn among us, yet we spend</L>
<L>Our time in sinne, not thinking of our end:</L>
<L><PB REF="4">So that the Lord to us may rightly say,</L>
<L>The people eat, and drink, and rise to play.</L>
<L>Mortals here note, and once your sinnes despise,</L>
<L>See here a mans grave digd, fore his own eyes,</L>
<L>In S. <HI>Sepulchers</HI> new Church-yard 'tis said,</L>
<L>I'th interim that his grave t'his mind was made,</L>
<L>He took his book and pray'd, oh blest be God</L>
<L>That chastis'd him with his paternall rod,</L>
<L>Which did not take his sence from him away,</L>
<L>But gave him time and sence to reade and pray:</L>
<L>And when of's prayers he an end had made,</L>
<L>Death ends his life, so he in's grave was laid.</L>
<L>Oh then remember this you that have health.</L>
<L>Death playes the theese, takes many a one by stealth,</L>
<L>Before of him they think, this I may say</L>
<L>He hardly will allow them time to pray.</L>
<L>Then we that live had need to pray apace,</L>
<L>That sees death and the grave before our face.</L>
<L>Let's humbly pray, and <HI>Ninive</HI> cloath-like,</L>

<HEAD>Of the man that revived again in S. <HI>Georges</HI> Church-yard.</HEAD>
<L>A Countrey man, as 'twas to me reported,</L>
<L>About some businesse to this town resorted,</L>
<L>Finding himself not well, strait way he went</L>
<L>Into S. <HI>Georges</HI> fields in discontent,</L>
<L>He drunk a penny-worth of milk 'tis said,</L>
<L>And down upon the ground himself he laid;</L>
<L>The milk-woman of whom the milk he bought,</L>
<L>Told him to lie upon the ground 'twas naught,</L>
<L>And wisht him then to rise, but he replide,</L>
<L>That he would there but little time reside</L>
<L>Vpon the ground, onely to rest his head,</L>
<L>And sleep a little on that earthy bed;</L>
<L>She seeing him so resolutely bent,</L>
<L>Took up her milk pail, and away she went.</L>
<L>And for a certain truth to me twas told,</L>
<L>That after she in town her milk had sold,</L>
<L>She came the same way home, and found him dead</L>
<L>As she poor woman then imagined,</L>
<L>But twas not so, for in a trance lay he,</L>
<L>Yet others were deceiv'd as well as she;</L>
<L>For all that saw him did conclude and say,</L>
<L>The man is dead, let us make haste away,</L>
<L><PB REF="5">And to the Sexton of the Parish go,</L>
<L>Telling him how it is, then let him do</L>

<L>And did the matter unto him unfold.</L>
<L>And to the Masters of the Parish then,</L>
<L>The Sexton went with other honest men,</L>
<L>And told them how the matter then did stand,</L>
<L>The Masters of the Parish gave command</L>
<L>To bring the man that was supposed dead,</L>
<L>Into the Church-yard, which they quickly did,</L>
<L>And then the searchers they were fetcht with speed,</L>
<L>So all concluded he was dead indeed;</L>
<L>And when the corps the Searchers had survaid,</L>
<L>They saw no cause why they should be afraid;</L>
<L>For of the Plague they found the man was free</L>
<L>As cleare a corps as ever they did see:</L>
<L>So then to bury him they all conclude,</L>
<L>But mark I pray what afterward ensude.</L>
<L>It being neare night, the Sexton did agree</L>
<L>To bury him when he could better see.</L>
<L>The first worke in the morning that he did,</L>
<L>Should be to bury him: meane while he hid</L>
<L>The man under a Coffin, as some say,</L>
<L>Not that he fear'd that he would runne away,</L>
<L>But that no ravenous thing should him offend,</L>

<HEAD>A strange and true report of a Gentleman riding into the Countrey, finding himself not well, and what chanced to him on the way.</HEAD>
<L>A Gentleman as true report doth tell,</L>
<L>Into the Countrey rode, a while to dwell:</L>
<L>Finding himself saint, he began to grieve,</L>
<L>And stripping up at last his doublet sleeve,</L>
<L>He found upon his arme some blew spots there,</L>
<L>Which like unto Gods tokens did appeare.</L>
<L>So spurs his horse, and speedily he rides</L>
<L>To the next town, and there all night abides.</L>
<L>But yet before he went to bed 'tis said,</L>
<L>In's chamber he a good fire causde be made:</L>
<L>So when the Chamberlain had made a fire,</L>
<L>A payle of water he did then desire.</L>
<L>Then cal'd he for the best sheet in the Inne,</L>
<L>The which he wet, and wrapt himself therein.</L>
<L>The sheet being wet, and he starke naked in it,</L>
<L>About his body he did strait way pinne it;</L>
<L>Which being done, away to bed he went.</L>
<L>The morning being come, and the night spent,</L>
<L><PB REF="8">He found himself well, and his body cleare</L>
<L>From all those spots which before did appeare.</L>
<L>Strange physick this may seem to many a one,</L>
<L>And yet he prov'd himself a good physitian.</L>
<L>But y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> my Doctor he shall never be,</L>
<L>Such physick sure would be the death of me.</L>
<L>And to conclude, he paid most liberally</L>
<L>For all he called for, especially</L>
<L>For his wet winding sheet, and gave command</L>
<L>To bury that some wet s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eet out of hand,</L>
<L>A yard deep in the ground, or somewhat more,</L>
<L>Which was an honest care of him therefore.</L>
<L>And so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or all things he gave them content,</L>
<L>Then takes his leave, and so away he went.</L>
<L>The sheet was buried too immediately,</L>
<L>But covetousnesse would not let it long lye</L>
<L>Vnder the ground, then buried as it were,</L>
<L>But took this sheet up without wit or feare.</L>
<L>And all of them that were so fool-hardy,</L>
<L>That sheet to take up, of the plague did dye:</L>
<L>And all the rest that had no hand in it,</L>
<L>Escapt the plague, who had more grace and wit.</L>
