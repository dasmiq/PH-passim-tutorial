Thys Atle~ta was wounders swyfte on fote, wherfore suche a lawe was ordeyned y^t no ma~ sholde haue her to wyfe but suche as myght ouer renne her &amp; take her by strengthe of fote. And so it befell that many came &amp; ranne wyth her, but
<PB REF="2">
she was so swyfte that no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> course of reunynge. At y^e last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Pomeys vnto her father &amp; sayd to hym thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lorde yf it myght please you to gyue me your doughter to wyfe, I wyll gladly renne wyth her. Than sayd her father, there is suche a lawe ordeyned &amp; set, that who so wyll haue her to wyfe, must fyrst renne wyth her, &amp; yf he fayle in hys course, y^t he ouertake her not, he shall lese hys heed, &amp; yf it fortune hym to ouertake her, than shall I wedde her vnto hym. And wha~ the Emperoure had tolde hym all the peryll that myght&punc; fall in y^e wyn|nynge of her, the knyght wylfully graunted to abyde that ieopardye. Than the knyght let ordeyne hym thre balles of golde agaynst the rennynge. And whan they had begon to renue a lyttel spare, the yonge lady ouer ranne hym, than y^e knyght threwe forth before her the fyrst ball of golde. And whan the damoysell sawe y^e bal she stouped and toke it vp, and that whyle the knyght wanne before her, but that auayled lyttell, for wha~ she perceyued that, she ranne so fast that in shorte space she gate before hym agayne. And than he threwe forth the seconde hall of golde, and she stouped as she dyd before to take it vp, and in that whyle the knyght wanne be|fore her agayne, whyche thys yonge damoysell seynge co~strayned herselfe and ranne so fast, tyll at the last she had hym at a vauntage agayn, &amp; was afore hym, and by that tyme they were nygh the marke where they sholde abyde, wherfore y^e knyght threwe forth y^e thyrde ball before her, and lyke as she had done before s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouped downe to take vp the ball, &amp; whyle she was in takynge vp the thyrde ball the knyght gate afore her, and was fyrst at the marke.

<P><PB REF="3">&para;By this Emperour is vnderstande the father of he|uen; and by thys damoysell is vnderstande the soule of man, with whome many deuylles desyre to renne, and to deceyue her thrugh theyr te~ptacyons, but she wyth|standeth them myghtyly and ouerco~meth them. And whan they haue done theyr power, and may not spede than make they thre balles of golde, and casteth them before her in the thre ages of man, that is to saye, in youth, in manhode, &amp; in olde age. In youth he casteth the ball of lechery before her, that is to saye, the desyre of the flesshe, neuerthelesse for all this ball oftentymes man ouerco~meth the deuyll by confessyon, contrycyon and satisfaccyon. The seconde ball is the ball of pryde, the whyche the deuyll casteth to man in hys manhode, that is to saye, in hys myddle age, but thys ball man oftentymes ouerco~meth as he dyd y^e fyrst. But let hym beware of the thyrde ball, whyche is y^e ball of couetyse that the deuyll casteth to man in hys olde age, whyche is dredefull. For but yf a man may ouerco~me this ball wyth these other two, he shall lese hys honour, that is to saye, the kyngdome of heuen. For whan man bren|neth in couetyse, he thynketh not on goostly rychesse, for euer his hert is set on woorldly goodes, and recketh not of prayers ne of almes dedes, and thus leseth he hys herytage, to y^e whyche god hath bought hym wyth hys pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yous blode, vnto the whyche our lorde Iesu Chryst brynge bothe you &amp; me &amp; al mankynde.

<P>THere dwelled somtyme in Rome a myghty Em+perour &amp; a wyse named Anselme, whyche bare in his armes a shelde of syluer w^t fyue reed roses. This Emperour had thre sones, whome he loued moche, he
<PB REF="3">
had also contynuall warre wyth the kynge of Egypte, in the whyche warre he lost all hys temporall goodes, excepte a vertuous tree. It fortuned after on a daye that he gaue batayle to y^e sayd kyng of Egypte, wher|in he was greuously wou~ded. Neuerthelesse he optey|ned the vyctory, notwythstandynge he had hys deedly wou~de, wherfore whyle he lay in poynt of deth he cal|led vnto hym his eldest sone &amp; sayd. My moost dere and welbeloued sone, al my te~poral rychesse I haue spente &amp; almoost nothynge is lefte me, except a vertuous tree the whyche standeth in the myddes of myne Empyre, I gyue to the all that is vnder the erth &amp; aboue y^e erth of y^e same tree. O my reuerent father (&abquod; he) I thanke you moche. Than sayde themperour, call to me my se|cond sone. Anone his eldest sone greatly gladded of his fathers gyfte called in hys brother, and whan he came than sayd themperour. My dere sone (quod he) I may not make my testament for as moche as I haue spent all my goodes, excepte a tree whyche standeth in myne Empyre, of the whyche tree I bequethe to the all that is greate and small. Than answered he &amp; sayd. My re+uerent father I thanke you moche. Than sayd y^e Em|perour, call to me my thyrde sone, and so it was done. And wha~ he was co~me, the Emperour sayd. My dere sone I must dye of these woundes, &amp; I haue but onely a vertuous tree, of the whyche I haue bequethed thy bretherne theyr porcyon, and to the I bequethe thy por+cyon, for I wyll that thou haue of the sayd tree all that is wete &amp; drye. Than sayde hys sone. Father I thanke you. Soone after that y^e Emperour had made hys be|quest he dyed. And the eldest sone anone toke season of the tree. Whan the seconde brother herde thys, he sayde
<PB REF="4">
My brother, by what lawe or tytel occupy ye thys tree. Dere brother quod he I occupy it by thys tytell, my fa+ther gaue me all that is vnder the erth &amp; aboue of the sayd tree, &amp; therfore by reason thys tree is myne. Un|knowynge to the quod the seconde brother, he gaue me all that is in brede, lengthe &amp; depnes of the sayd tree, &amp; therfore I haue as great&punc; ryght in y^e tree as thou. This hearyng the thyrde sone came to them &amp; sayd. O ye my best beloued bretherne, it behoueth you not to stryue for this tree, for as moche ryght haue I in this tree as ye, for well ye wote by y^e lawe, that the last wyll &amp; testa+ment ought to stande, for sothly he gaue me of the sayd tree all that is wete &amp; drye, &amp; therfore by ryght the tree is myne, but for as moche as your tales ben greate, &amp; myne also, my cou~seyle is that we be iustyfyed by rea|son, for it is not good nor co~mendable that any stryfe or dyssencyo~ shold be amonge vs. Here besyde dwelleth a kyng of reason, for it is not good to stryue, go we there vnto hym, &amp; eueryche of vs laye hys ryght before hym and lyke as he wyll iudge, let vs stande to hys iudge|ment. Than sayd hys bretherne, this cou~seyle is good, wherfore they wente all thre vnto the kyng of reason, &amp; eueryche of them syngularly shewed sorth hys ryght vnto hym, lyke as it is sayd before. Whan y^e kynge had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erde theyr tytels, he rehersed them all agayn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yngu|larly, fyrst sayenge to the eldest sone thus. Thou sayst for the quod the kyng that thy father gaue the all that is vnder the erth &amp; aboue the erth of the sayd tree. And to the seconde brother he bequethed all that is in brede length &amp; depnes of that tree. And to the thyrde brother he gaue all that is wete &amp; drye. And with that he layde the lawe for them, and sayd that the last wyll ought to
<PB REF="4">
stande. Now my dere sones, breuely I shall satisfye all your reasons. And whan he had thus sayde, he turned hym vnto y^e eldest brother, sayinge thus. My dere sone yf the lyst to abyde y^e iudgement, of ryght the behoueth to be letten blode of the ryght arme. My lorde quod he your wyll shal be done. Than called the kynge forth a dyscrete physycyon, co~mau~dyng hym to let hym blode. Whan the eldest sone was thus letten blode, the kyng sayd to them all thre. My dere sones quod he where is your father buryed. Than answered they &amp; sayde. For|sothe my lorde in suche a place. Anone the kyng co~mau~+ded to delue vp the body, and to drawe out a bone of his brest, &amp; to bury the body agayne, &amp; so it was done. And whan the bone was drawen out, the kynge co~mau~ded that it shold be layde in the blode of the elder brother, &amp; that it shold lye tyll it had receyued kyndly the blode, &amp; than to be layde in y^e sonne &amp; dryed, &amp; after that it shold be wasshen with clere water, hys seruauntes fulfylled al that he co~mau~ded. And whan they began to wasshe the blode vanysshed clene away. Whan the kyng sawe this, he sayd to the seconde sone. It behoueth y^t thou be letten blode as thy brother is. Than sayd he. My lorde thy wyll shall be fulfylled, &amp; anone he was serued lyke as hys brother was in all thynge, &amp; whan they began to wasshe the bone, the blode vanysshed awaye. Than sayd the kyng to the thyrde sone. My dere chylde it be|houeth the also to be letten blode. He answered &amp; sayd. My lorde it pleaseth me well so to be. Whan y^e yongest brother was letten blode, &amp; serued in al thynge lyke as his two bretherne were serued before, whan y^e kynges seruau~tes began to wasshe y^e bone, they might neyther for wasshynge ne for fretynge do away the blode of the
<PB REF="5">
bone, but euer it appered blody. Whan the kynge sawe thys he sayd. It appereth openly y^t this blode wythout doubte is of the nature of thys bone, thou art hys true sone, and these other two ben bastardes, I gyue to the that tree for euermore.</P>
<P>&para;Dere fre~des thys Emperour is our lord Iesu chryst whyche bare a sheelde of syluer wyth fyue reed roses, that is ta saye, hys body that is so fayre so clere &amp; more radiant than ony syluer, according w^t psalmist sayinge thus. Speciosus forma pre filijs hominu~. That is to saye, he was more specyall &amp; fayrer of shape than all y^e chyldren of men. By these .v. roses we vnderstande hys fyue woundes, whyche he suffred for mankynde. And by the kynge of Egypte we vnderstande the deuyll, a+gaynst whome he fought all the tyme of hys lyfe, &amp; at the last he was slayne for ma~kynde. Neuerthelesse be|fore hys deth he made hys testament to hys thre sones. By the fyrst to whome he gaue of the tree all that was vnder y^e erth &amp; aboue, we shall vnderstande the myghty men &amp; states of thys worlde, to whome he hath gyuen power in erth, in water and in ayre, so that they be obe|dyent at theyr wyll, &amp; all thynge vnder heuen. By the seconde sone to whome he gaue y^e tree in lenght, brede &amp; depnes, we may vnderstande the wytty men of thys worlde, as Iustyces, atturneys and men of lawe, these men haue power in lengthe, brede &amp; depnes vpon gen|tylmen of myddle degre, and vpon poore men, them to deme &amp; iudge as they lyst. By y^e thyrde sone to whome he gaue all that was wete &amp; drye of the tree, we shall vnderstande good chrysten men, whyche haue &amp; suffre bothe wete an drye, that is to saye, now pouerte, now trouble, now solace, now care, now cold, now hete, and
<PB REF="5">
all this they receyue of god thankfully to haue this no|ble tree y^t was thus bequethed them. Thys tree is the tree of paradyse, y^t is to saye, euerlastyng iaye of heuen whyche is gyue~ to vs all, yf we wyl take it thankfully, neuerthelesse it is heuen in dyuerse wyse, &amp; not egally, for some hath more, &amp; some hath lesse, after theyr me|rytes, thys notwithsta~dyng euery man opteyneth not, therfore it behoueth them to go vnto y^e kyng of reason, that is to saye, vnto the father of heuen, that knoweth all thyng or they be made. The fyrst sone was let blode and in his blode the bone was wrapped. By this blode we shall vnderstande our merytoryous dedes, &amp; by the whyte &amp; heuy almes dede whych is ful heuy to the~ that gyue almes, neuerthelesse it maketh the soule whyte, wherfore whan these myghty men gyue almes, or do a merytoryous dede, though it be made drye &amp; stablys|shed wyth the sonne, &amp; by the wynde of dyuyne predica+cyon, neuerthelesse whan the water of pryde, enuye, wrath, &amp; suche other, all the merytoryous dedes done before is brought to nought, &amp; the blode, that is to saye the almes dedes by y^e whyche they sholde co~me to euer|lastynge lyfe, begynneth to vanysshe awaye. For why as the apostle sayth, he that offendeth in one synne, is gylty in all. Thys blode letter whych let them blode is a discrete confessour, though the myghty men of thys worlde do good dedes &amp; fulfyl theyr penau~ce, neuerthe+lesse whan the water of couetyse, that is to saye, whan the purse is full of money anone they gyue true iudge|ment, agaynst whome it is wryten thus. The wyse|dome of this worlde is nothyng els but foly afore god And agaynst the myghty men of thys worlde speketh holy scrypture and sayth. Where be those myghty men
<PB REF="6">
whych were praysed among the byrdes of heuen, eate and drynke, and often desce~ded to hell. The thyrde sone of thys Emperour is a good chrysten man, whyche all the tyme of hys lyfe dyd good dedes, &amp; lyued wythout pryde, enuy and lechery, from the bone of suche a man the blode may not be wasshen awaye, that is to saye, hys merytoryous dedes may not be put away from pe+naunce, suche a man is y^e true chylde of god, of whome our lorde speketh thus. Ye the whyche haue forsaken all thynge for me, all, that is to saye, ye that haue for|saken the wyll of synne, shall receyue an ho~dred tymes more, that is to saye, ye shall not onely receyue the tree of paradyse, but also the heritage of heuen. These two other sones ben bastardes, for why, that they behote in theyr baptym they wrought all the contrary thrugh theyr wycked lyuynge. And therfore he that desyreth to optayne the ioyes of heuen, hym behoueth to abyde stedfastly in werkynge of good werkes, and than by reason may he optayne the tree of paradyse, vnto the whyche that lorde brynge vs whyche lyueth &amp; regneth eternally worlde wythouten ende. Amen.</P>
<P>IN Rome there dwelled somtyme a noble Emperour named Dyoclesia~, whych aboue all worldly goodes loued the vertue of charyte, wherfore he desyred greatly to knowe what fowle loued her byrdes best to the entent that he myght therby growe to more perfyte charyte. It fortuned after vpon a daye that thys Em|perour walked to the forest to take hys dysporte, where as he fou~de the nest of a great byrde that is called in la+tyn strutio wyth her byrde, the whyche byrde thempe|rour toke wyth hym, &amp; closed hym in a vessell of glasse.
<PB REF="6">
The mother of thys lyttell byrde folowed after vnto y^e Emperours place, and entred into the hall where her byrde was closed. But whan she sawe her byrde and myght by no meanes co~me to her, ne gete her out, she returned agayn to y^e forest, &amp; there she abode thre dayes and at y^e last she returned agayne to y^e palays, bearyng in her mouth a worme that is called thumare. Whan she came where her byrde was, she let the worme fall vpon y^e glasse, thrugh vertue of whyche worme y^e glasse brake, &amp; the byrde escaped &amp; s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ewe forth w^t hys mother. Whan themperour sawe thys, he praysed moche y^e mo|ther of thys byrde, whyche so dylygently laboured for the delyueraunce of her byrde.</P>
<P>&para; My frendes thys Emperour is the father of heue~, whyche greatly loueth them that ben in perfyte loue &amp; charite. Thys lytel byrde closed in the glasse &amp; take~ fro the forest was Adam our forefather, whyche was exi|led fro paradyse, and put in the glasse, that is to say, in hell. Thys hearyng the mother of the byrde, that is to wyte, the sone of god descended fro heuen &amp; came to the forest of the worlde, and lyued here thre dayes &amp; more, bearyng wyth hym a worme, that is to say, manhode accordyng w^t the psalmyst, sayinge. Ego sum vermis etno~ homo. That is to saye, I am a worme &amp; no man. Thys manhode was suffred to be slayne amonge the iewes, of whose blode y^e vessel eternall was broke~, and the byrde went out, that is to saye&punc; Adam wente forth wyth hys mother the sone of god &amp; flewe vnto heuen.</P>
<P>SOmtyme dwelled in Rome a worthy emperour and a wyse, whyche had a fayre doughter and a gracyous in the syght of euery man. Thys Emperour
<PB REF="7">
bethought hym on a daye to whome he myght gyue his doughter in maryage, saying thus. Yf I gyue my doughter to a ryche man, &amp; he be a foole than is she lost and yf I gyue her to a poore man &amp; a wytty, than may he gete hys lyuynge for hym and her by his wysdome. There was that tyme dwellynge in the cite of Rome a phylosopher named Socrates, poore &amp; wyse, whyche came to themperour &amp; sayd. My lord displease you not though I put forth my petycyon before your hyghnes Themperour sayd, what so euer pleaseth the tell forth Than sayde Socrates. My lorde ye haue a doughter whome I desyre aboue al thyng. Themperour answe+red &amp; sayd. My frende I shall gyue the my doughter to wyfe vpon thys condicyon, that yf she dye in thy felaw+shyp after that she be wedded to the, thou shalte wyth|outen doutelese thy heed. Than sayd Socrates. Upo~ thys condicyon I wyll gladly take her to be my wyfe. Themperour hearyng thys, let call forth all y^e lordes &amp; states of his Empyre, and made a greate feest at theyr weddynge. And after y^e feest Socrates ledde home his wyfe to hys owne house, where as they lyued in peace and helth longe tyme. But at the last thys Emperours doughter syckned to deth. Whan Socrates perceyued thys, he sayde to hym selfe. Alas and woo to me, what shall I doo, and whether shall I flee, yf themperours doughter that is my wyfe sholde dye, &amp; for sorowe this Socrates wente to a forest there besyde &amp; wepte byt|terly. The whyle he thus wepte &amp; mourned there came an aged man bearyng a staffe in hys hande, &amp; asked y^e cause of Socrates why he mourned. Socrates answe+red and sayde. I wedded themperours doughter vpon thys co~dycyon, y^t yf she dyed in my felowshyp, I sholde
<PB REF="7">
lese my lyfe, now she is syckened vnto the deth, &amp; I can fynde no remedy nor helpe, &amp; therfore I mourne more than any creature can thynke. Than sayde the olde ma~ be ye co~forted, for I shall be your helper, yf ye wyll do after my counseyle. In this forest be thre herbes, yf ye make a drynke of the fyrst to your wyfe, &amp; of the other two a plaester, &amp; yf she vse thys medicynall drynke and plaester in due tyme, wythout doubte she shall recouer to perfyte helth. Socrates fulfylled al as the old man had taught hym. And wha~ hys wyfe had vsed a whyle that medicynall drynke &amp; pleaster, wythin shorte tyme she was perfytly hole of al her sycknes. And whan the Emperoure herde that Socrates wrought so wysely, and how dylygently he laboured for to heale his wyfe he promoted hym to great dyngnyte and worshyp.</P>
<P>&para;Dere fre~des this Emperour is our lord Iesu chryst hys doughter so fayre &amp; so gracyous is the soule, made at the similitude of god, whych is full gracyous &amp; glo|ryous in the syght of hym &amp; of hys au~gels, whyle that she is not defouled &amp; abydeth in her owne propre clen|nesse. Thys soule god wolde not gyue it to a ryche man but to a poore man, that is to say, a man that is made of the slyme of the erth. Thys Socrates is a poore ma~ for why, euery man co~meth poore and naked in to this worlde from hys mothers bely, &amp; euery ma~ taketh hys soule in wedlocke vpon suche co~dicyon, that yf she dye in hys felawshyp by deedly synne, wythout doubte he shal lese eternal lyfe. Therfore o thou man yf thy wyfe sycken so thrugh deedly sinne, do tha~ as Socrates dyd go vnto the forest, that is holy chyrche, and thou shalte fynde there an olde man with a sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, that is a discrete co~fessour, whyche shall tell the of these thre herbes, for
<PB REF="8">
he hath power to bynde &amp; to vnbynde. The fyrst herbe is contricyon, of whome thou sholdest make thy drynke of teares. Ambrose sayth that teares wassheth awaye synne, where shame is to knowlege it, and these two other herbes ben confessyon and satysfaccyon, yf these herbes be vsed in plaester, the synner wythout doubte shall receyue his helth, and his soule shall be delyuered from synne, and by al ryght he shall haue euerlastyng lyfe. Vnto the whyche brynge vs our lorde Iesus.</P>
<P>SOmtyme there regned in Rome a myghty Em|perour and a wyse named Frederyke, whyche had an onely sone, whome he loued moche. Thys Em|perour whan he laye at the poynt of deth, he called vn|to hym his sone &amp; sayd. Dere sone I haue a ball of gold whych I gyue the vpon my blessyng, that thou anone after my deth shalt gyue it to the moost foole that thou mayst fynde. Than sayd hys sone. My lorde wothout doubte your wyll shall be fulfylled. Anone thys yonge lorde after the deth of hys father went &amp; sought in ma+ny realmes &amp; founde many recheles fooles, bycause he wolde satysfye hys fathers wyll laboured farther tyll he came in to a realme where the lawe was suche, that euery yere a newe kyng was chosen there, &amp; thys kyng had onely the guydynge of y^e realme but a yere, &amp; at the yeres ende he was deposed &amp; put in exile in an ylande, where as he shold wretchedly fynysshe hys lyfe. Whan themperours sone came to thys realme the newe kyng was chosen w^t great honour, &amp; all maner of mynstral|sye wente afore hym, &amp; brought hym wyth great reue|rence and worshyp vnto hys regall sete. And whan the Emperours sone sawe that, he came vnto hym and sa|lewed
<PB REF="8">
hym reuerently &amp; sayd. My lorde loo I gyue the thys ball of gold on my fathers behalfe. Than sayd he I praye the tell me the cause why thou gyuest me thys ball. Tha~ answered thys yonge lorde and sayd. My fa+ther charged me in hys deth bedde vpon payn of forfey+tynge of his blessynge, that I sholde gyue this ball of y^e moost foole y^e I coude fynde, wherfore I haue sought many realmes, &amp; haue founde many fooles, neuerthe|lesse a more foole than thou art founde I neuer, &amp; ther+fore thys is the reason. It is not vnknowen to the that thou shalt regne but a yere, and at the yeres ende thou shalte be exiled into suche a place where as thou shalte dye a myscheuous deth, wherfore I holde the for the moost foole that euer I founde, that for the lordshyp of a yere thou woldest so wylfully lese thy selfe, &amp; therfore before all other I haue gyuen to the thys ball of gold. Than sayd the kyng, wythout doubte thou sayst sothe and therfore whan I am in full power of thys realme I shall sende before me greate treasoure and rychesse wherwyth I may lyue and saue my selfe from my sche|uous deth whan I shall be exiled &amp; put downe.

Whan the Emperour vnderstode these two vertues in hys doughter, he was ryght ioy|full, wherfore he made to proclayme thrugh out al hys Empyre, that what man poore or ryche wolde renne wyth hys doughter, shold haue her to wyfe wyth great ryches, yf he myght ouer renne her &amp; co~me sooner to y^e marke than she, &amp; yf she ouer renne hym &amp; co~me sooner to the marke than he, hys heed sholde be smytten of.

Thyrdly he made a purse of sylke set full of precyous stones, &amp; wythin the purse was a ball of thre colours, and vpon thys purse was wryte~ thys posey, who playeth w^t me, shall neuer be wery of my playe.

<P>SOmtyme in Rome dwelled a myghty Empe|rour &amp; a wyse named Theodose, whyche aboue all thynge loued best melody of harpe &amp; huntynge.

Than sayd themperour, good fre~de co~meth this melody of thy harpe or no. The poore man answered &amp; sayd. My reuerende lorde I shal tell you y^e trouth.

But alas &amp; welaway, on the other syde of thys water there co~meth a whysteler &amp; whysteleth so swetely, that ma|ny tymes the fysshes for sake me &amp; go to his whysteling and therfore my reuerende lord I beseche you of helpe agaynst his hyssyng &amp; whystelyng.

The prechers ought to haue the harpe of holy scrypture, wherw^t they may prayse &amp; honour god, &amp; also therwith drawe out of this worlde y^e synners. Therfore sayth y^e psalmist thus Prayse ye god in timpanes &amp; crowdes, and synge ye to hym on the harpe &amp; the psalter of .x. strenges, But now adayes the precher may say alas, for whan I preche &amp; teche holy scripture, the deuyll co~meth &amp; whysteleth so swetely that y^e synners drawe to hym, &amp; wyll not heare the worde of god, but they turne themselfe onely to the delyte of synne.

Whan thys was sayd the Emperour toke hys iourney to warde the holy lande, and the stewarde a longe tyme kepte well &amp; truly themperours ordynau~ce. But at the last it befell vpon a daye that this stewarde had espyed this yonge lady walkyng alone in an orcheyarde, with whose loue he was sodeynly taken, wherfore anone a|gaynst her wyll he defloured her. And wha~ he had syn|ned wyth her, he gaue her yll la~guage &amp; hated her more after than euer he loued her before, &amp; droue her out of y^e palays, wherfore this damoysel for great pouerte and defaute wente fro dore to dore &amp; begged her breed. But whan the knyghtes that were her kepers herde of thys they reproued shamefully the steward of y^t synful dede. Than the stewarde waxed wroth, &amp; for great hate that he had in his herte he despoyled y^e knyghtes of al theyr goodes, &amp; droue them fro the palays. And whan they were thus robbed &amp; exyled, some for defaute of goodes became theues, &amp; some manquellers, that thrugh thys inco~uenyent they wrought great harme.

Than sayd y^e Em+perour, what is befallen y^e that thou metest me in thys araye, for as moche as y^e art my stewarde thou sholdest haue mette me w^t a great company of knyghtes.

<P><PB REF="30">&para;Thys Emperour betokeneth our lorde Iesu Chryst Hys doughter betokeneth y^e soule of man, made at the similytude of our lorde god.

The greyhounde is the flesshe of man. The steward betokeneth euery man to whome god hath gyuen lyfe and soule to kepe vnder payne of lesyng euerlastyng lyfe. But a wretched man reme~brynge that is to co~me full often corrupteth &amp; de|fouleth hys soule by synne, &amp; dryueth her from her pa|lays of heuen, &amp; than goth she fro~ dore to dore, that is to say, fro~ synne to synne. He despoyled these .v. knyghtes of theyr goodes, that is to saye, the .v. wyttes of theyr vertues, takynge away the lawfull syght fro the eyen, exhortynge them vnlawfully, &amp; also steryng the eares to heare sclau~der &amp; backbytyng, &amp; so forth of al y^e other wyttes, &amp; thus some be made theues, &amp; some ma~quel|lers.

The co~mynge agayne of thys Emperour from y^e holy lande betokeneth the co~mynge of our lord Iesu Chryst at the daye of dome to deme all ma~kynde. Therfore do we as the steward dyd, accuse we fyrst our selfe of our synnes leest the deuyl &amp; the worlde accuse vs, &amp; than it were to late to aske mercy, therfore do we of our clothes betime that is to saye, our synfull lyfe, &amp; take we thre ropes in our handes.

The thyrde rope that sholde hange the felon, is y^e rope of satisfaccyon, of whych hangyng speketh the apostle, saying. Suspende elegit a i~a mea. My soule hath chosen to be hanged.

<P>SOmtyme in Rome dwelled a myghty emperour named Gorgony, whych had maryed a curteys lady &amp; a fayre to hys wyfe.

<P>SOmtyme in Rome dwelled a myghty emperour named Folemus, whych had wedded y^e kynges doughter of Germany, a fayre lady &amp; a curteys, which wythin shorte tyme conceyued and bare a sone. Whan thys chylde was borne, the states of the Empyre came to the Emperour, &amp; eueryche of them besought the Em+perour to nourysshe hys sone. The Emperour answe|red &amp; sayd. To morowe shall be a tourney, &amp; there shall ye all be, and whyche of you dothe best &amp; optayneth the vyctory, shall haue the kepynge of my sone, &amp; yf he nou|rysshe hym well, I shall promote hym to great dignite and honour. And yf he do the contrary, he shall dye the foulest deth that can be thought. Tha~ sayd they. Dere lorde all thys pleaseth vs well. On the morowe whan euery man was co~me to the tourney, the states iusted and scarmysshed full manfully longe tyme, tyll at y^e last there came a doughty knyght named. Iosyas, that so
<PB REF="37">
manfully bare hymselfe amonge them, that he wanne the vyctory. And anone whan all thys was done, this Iosias toke y^e chylde &amp; ledde hym forth with hym. And bycause this Emperours sone shold be receyued in his countree, he sente before to his castell, &amp; co~mau~ded his offycers that it sholde be dyght bothe w^tout &amp; within, &amp; that the chyldes bedde shold be made in the myddes of the castell, &amp; also the seuen scyences sholde be paynted aboute the chyldes bedde, that whan the chylde wake|ned out of hys slepe, he myght lye in his bedde and rede his lesson. This knyght had a fruytfull and a holsome well by y^e chyldes beddes syde, wherin he vsed to bathe hymselfe, &amp; the knyghtes wyfe bare y^e key of this well and there wss a wyndowe y^t the sonne myght co~me in and shyne. It fortuned on a daye that the lady y^t kepte the key lefte y^e wyndowe open thrugh neclygence. And whan the lady had so done, there came a bere and sawe the wyndowe open and went to the well &amp; bathed hym therin, of whose bathynge the well sauoured after for the greate hete that was that tyme, wherfore who so euer dronke therof waxed lepre w^tin short tyme. And so it fortuned within a lyttell space after that y^e lord &amp; the lady &amp; al theyr houshold were lepers, &amp; not w^tstandyng it appered not sodeynly. And in the meane tyme there came a great egle in at y^e wyndowe where as the Em|perours sone laye, and bare the chylde away out of his cradell. And whan the knyght &abper;ceyued this, he wepte bytterly &amp; sayd. Alas alas &amp; woo to me wretched crea|ture that euer I was borne, what shall I do, for now I am the sone of deth, for I am a foule leper, &amp; so is my wyfe &amp; all my housholde. And the whyle he was thus mournynge theere came to hym a phisycyan &amp; sayd to

hym Syr yf ye wyll do after my counseyle, it shall not repent you. Fyrst it behoueth you &amp; your wyfe and all your housholde to be letten blode, &amp; after y^t to be bathed and wasshen clene, &amp; than shall I laye to my medicyne And whan ye are hole, than shall you &amp; your wyfe &amp; all your housholde walke to the mountaynes and seke the Emperours sone, for the egle hath let hym fall in some place. The knyght wrought all thynge by the cou~seyle of thys phisycyan, &amp; anone after was letten blode &amp; re+ceyued the medicyne, &amp; than he was al hole &amp; hys wyfe and all his housholde, wherfore he lepte on his horse, &amp; toke wyth hym thre squyers, &amp; rode forth and sought y^e chylde. And at the last he founde hym hole and sounde lyenge in a valey, &amp; than was he greatly reioysed. And for the great ioye &amp; gladnes that was in hym for y^e fyn+dynge of themperours sone he made a great feest, &amp; af|ter the feest he ledde the chylde home to hys father. And whan themperour sawe his sone in good helth, he was ryght glad, wherfore he promoted hym to great wor|shyp, whych lyued after y^e longe tyme in great honour and worshyp, &amp; at y^e last ended hys lyfe in peace &amp; rest.</P>

Therfore do we as y^e knyght dyd, sende we be|fore messengers to dyght &amp; to make clene y^e castel of our herte from al spottes of synne by workes of mercy, &amp; so shall this chylde Iesu rest &amp; lyght in the myddes of our

<P>SOmtyme in Rome dwelled a myghty emperour named Andromyke, whych aboue all thynge lo+ued melody.

There was also dwellynge in thys Emperours courte a knyght named Ydrony, whome y^e Emperour
<PB REF="42">
loued moche, but oftentymes he was dronken, whych vyce the emperour hated aboue all thynge. And whan thys knyght perceyued hymselfe dronken, than wolde he go to the well &amp; drynke of the water &amp; refresshe hym selfe, so that what so euer the Emperour sayde to hym he wolde answere hym so reasonably, that no dronke~|nes myght be seen in hym, &amp; for hys wytty answere he was grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly beloued of the Emperour. Neuerthelesse his felowes of the courte enuyd hym moche, &amp; ymagy|ned amonge themselfe how they myght departe y^e Em+perours loue fro hym. It fortuned on a daye that this Emperour went to the forest and herde a nyghtyngale synge so merely, that oftentymes after he wolde ryse erly in y^e mornynge, &amp; somtyme fro~ hys meate &amp; walke to the wode for to heare the swetnes of her songe, wher+fore many of his men sayd amonge the~selfe. Our lorde delyteth so moche in the nyghtyngales songe, that he recketh lytell of our profyte, in so moche y^t thrugh two thynges his loue is withdrawen fro~ vs, that is to say by Ydrony the knyght &amp; by the swete songe of the nygh+tyngale. Than sayd an olde knyght that was amonge them. Syrs quod he, yf ye wyll do by my counseyle, I shall delyuer you of the knyght Ydrony &amp; of the nygh|tyngale w^tout hurte or deth. They sware &amp; sayd, what so euer ye bydde vs do, we shal anone fulfyll w^t all our herte. Whan thys knyght herde thys, wythin a whyle after he espyed this Ydrony droken, wherfore he locked fast y^e well, &amp; as thys knyght Ydrony came to refresshe hymselfe, he founde y^e well fast locked. The Emperour had a great mater to treate, wherfore in haste he sente for this knyght, bycause of hys great wysdom to haue hys counseyle. And whan he came before y^e Emperour
<PB REF="42">
he was so dronken that he myght not ones moue hys tonge, neyther had wytte, reason, nor vnderstandynge to answere the Emperour to hys mater. But whan the Emperour sawe thys, he was greatly greued, for so moche as he hated that vyce, wherfore he co~maunded anone that fro~ that day forth he sholde no more be seen wythin hys lande vpon payne of deth. Thys hearynge hys fomen greatly were gladded, &amp; sayd vnto the olde knyght. Now be we delyuered of thys knyght Ydrony, there is no more to do but y^t we myght fynde the waye to be delyuered of the nyghtyngale, in whyche the Em+perour delyteth so moche. Than sayd thys olde knyght your eares shall heare and your eyen shall se that thys nyghtyngale shalbe destroyed in shorte tyme. Not long after thys olde knyght espyed that y^e nyghtyngale vsed to syt vpon a tree euen aboue the foresayd well, where as her make came &amp; grendred with her, neuerthelesse in the absence of her make she toke oftentymes an other make &amp; dyd auoutry, &amp; whan she had thus done, than wolde she descende to the well and bathe her selfe, that whan her make came, he sholde fele no sauour ne euyll odour of y^t she had done.

<P>&para;Thys Emperour betokeneth our lorde Iesu Chryst which loueth greatly the songe of perfyte deuocyon, for whan we praye we speke w^t god, &amp; whan we rede, god speketh wyth vs. The well that was in y^e palays beto|keneth confessyon that is in the chyrche, therfore yf ony man be dronken wyth synne, let hym drynke of y^e well of confessyon, &amp; wythout doubte he shall be safe. Thys ydrony betokeneth euery man that wylfully returneth agayne to synne after his confessyon, lyke as a dogge y^t maketh a vomyte &amp; casteth out the meate that he hath eaten afore, &amp; after wha~ he is hungry co~meth &amp; eateth it agayne. Neuerthelesse yf a man y^t hath synned thus wyll drynke of y^e well of confessyon, he shall receyue his goostly strengthes. The nyghtyngale y^t sate on the tree betokeneth the soule y^e sytteth on y^e tree of holy doctryne And her songe betokeneth the soule that sytteth on the tree in deuoute prayers to god. But thys soule dothe a|uoutry as oftentymes as she consenteth to synne. Ne|uerthelesse yf she renne to confessyon &amp; bathe her w^t the water of contricyon, god shall loue her. But her fomen that be the fendes of hell seyng thys that god is so mer+cyfull, they stoppe the well of confessyon, that is to say, the mouthes of them that wolde shryue the~selfe, wyth shame &amp; drede of penaunce, that they dare not tell forth theyr synnes. And thus ben many exiled &amp; put to deth euerlastyng. And therfore study we to bathe our lyfe in the well of confessyon wyth y^e water of contrycyon, and than may we be sure to co~me to euerlastyng lyfe. Unto the whyche god brynge bothe you and me.

And anone after hym came a hu~gry lyon and fell in to y^e same pyt, &amp; after the lyon an ape, and after y^e ape a serpent. And whan the stewarde was thus walled w^t these thre beestes, he was greatly moued, and dred sore. There was that tyme dwellyng in the cyte a poore man named Guy, that had no good saue onely an asse, wherw^t dayly he caryed styckes and fallen wode &amp; suche as he coude gete in y^e forest, &amp; those he brought to y^e market and solde the~ &amp; in this wyfe he susteyned hymselfe &amp; hys wyfe as well as he myght.

Than the stewarde made a great othe and sayd that he wolde &abpro;mote hym &amp; al his to great rychesse. Than sayd Guy yf thou wylt fulfyll thy promesse I shall do y^t ye byd me And with that went agayn to the cyte &amp; brought with hym a longe rope &amp; came to y^e pyt &amp; sayd. Syr stewarde lo I let downe a rope to the, bynde thyselfe aboute the myddle therwyth, that I may pull the vp. Than was the steward glad &amp; sayd. Good frende let downe y^e rope. And with y^t he cast the ende of the rope downe into the pyt. And whan the lyon sawe that, he caught the rope &amp; helde it fast, &amp; Guy drewe y^e lyon vp, wenynge to hym he had drawen vp the stewarde, &amp; whan he had so done the lyon thanked hym in his maner &amp; ranne to y^e wode.

he thanked Guy as he coude &amp; ranne to the wode. The thyrde tyme he let downe the rope &amp; drewe vp y^e serpent whyche thanked hym &amp; went to y^e wode. The stewarde cryed wyth an hye voyce. O dere frende now am I de|lyuered of thre venymous beestes, now let downe the corde to me, that I may co~me vp. And thys poore Guy let downe the rope, &amp; the stewarde bou~de hymselfe fast abouthe the myddle, &amp; anone Guy drewe hym vp. And whan he was thus holpe he sayde to Guy.

Than hys wyfe de|maunded hym why he gadered no wode wherw^t they myght lyue that day. Than tolde he her all the processe as it befell, how the stewarde fell in to y^e pyt, &amp; also the lyon, the ape, &amp; the serpent, that he had made in y^e sayd forest, &amp; how he had holpen hym out wyth a corde &amp; sa|ued hym from deuouryng of y^e thre venymous beestes &amp; how he sholde go to the stewarde &amp; sethe hys rewarde on y^e morowe.

So in the mornynge Guy arose &amp; wente to y^e palays &amp; knocked at the gate. Than came the porter &amp; asked the cause of his knockyng. I praye the quod this Guy go to y^e stewarde and saye to hym that here abydeth a poore man at the gate that spake wyth hym yesterday in the forest. The porter went in &amp; tolde the steward as y^e poore man had sayd.

Than the porter answered &amp; sayd, gladly I wyl do thyne erande, but I drede me sore that it shall be thy hurte.

And whan he was perfytly hole, he went to the forest as he was wont for to gader styckes &amp; small wode for hys lyuynge. And as he went aboute in that forest he sawe a stronge lyon, dryuynge before hym asses that were charged w^t chaffer and mar+chau~dyse. Thys lyon droue forth the asses before Guy whyche dred sore the lyon leest he wold haue deuoured hym, neuerthelesse whan he behelde the lyon better, he knewe well that he was the same lyon y^t de drewe out of the pyt.

<P>IN Rome dwelled somtyme a myghty Emperour na+med Anselme, whych had wedded y^e kynges dough|ter of Iherusalem, a fayre lady and a gracyous in the syght of euery man, but she was longe tyme wyth the Emperour or she wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> co~ceyued wyth chylde, wher|fore the nobles of y^e Empyre were ryght sorowfull by|cause theyr lorde had none heyre of hys body begoten. Tyll at the last it befel that this Anselme walked after supper in an euenynge in hys gardeyn, and bethought hymselfe how he had none heyre, and how the kynge of Ampluy warred on hym co~tynually for so moche as he had no sone to make defence in hys absence, wherfore he was ryght sorowfull, &amp; wente to hys chambre and slepte. And at the last hym thought he sawe a vysyon in hys slepe, that y^e mornynge was more clerer tha~ it was wont to be, &amp; that the mone was moche more paler on that one syde than on that other.

Dere lorde tell vs your dreme, and we shall declare vnto you what it betokeneth. Tha~ y^e Em|perour tolde them fro~ the begynnynge to the endynge as it is afore sayd. Whan the phylosophers herde thys wyth a glad chere they answered &amp; sayd. Lord y^e dreme that ye sawe betokeneth good, for the Empyre shall be more clerer than it is. The mone that is more pale on y^e one syde than on y^e other betokeneth the Empresse, that hath lost parte of her colour thrugh the co~cepcyon of a sone y^t she hath conceyued. The lytell byrde betokeneth the sone that she shal beare. The two beestes that fedde thys byrde betokeneth all the wyse men &amp; ryche men of this Empyre shall obey thy sone. These other beestes y^t bowed theyr heedes to the byrde betokeneth that many other nacyo~s shall do hym homage. The byrde y^e songe so swetely to thys lytell byrde betokeneth y^e Romayns whyche shall reioyce and synge bycause of this byrthe. Lo this is y^e very interpretacyon of your dreme. Whan the Emperour herde this, he was right ioyfull. Soone after that the Empresse trauayled &amp; was delyuered of a fayre sone, in whose birth was great ioye made w^tout ende. Whan y^e kyng of Ampluy herde thys, he thought in hymselfe thus. Lo I haue warred agaynst the Em|perour all the dayes of my lyfe, and now he hath a sone the whych wyll reuenge all thre wronges that I haue done &amp; wrought agaynst his father whan he co~meth to full age, therfore it is better that I sende to the Empe+rour and beseche hym of trewse &amp; peace, that hys sone may haue nothynge agaynst me whan he commeth to

manhode. Wha~ he had thus sayd to hymselfe, he wrote vnto the Emperoure, besechynge hym to haue peace. Whan the Emperour sawe that the kynge of Ampluy wrote to hym more for drede than for loue, he wrote a|gayne to hym, that yf he wolde fynde good &amp; suffycient surety to kepe the peace, &amp; bynde hymselfe all the days of hys lyfe to do hym seruyce &amp; homage, &amp; to gyue hym yerely a certayne trybute, he wolde receyue hym to the peace. Whan the kynge had redde the tenour of y^e Em|perours lettres, he called his counseyle, praying the~ to gyue hym cou~seyle how he myght best do as touchyng thys mater. Than sayd they. It is good that ye obey y^e Emperours wyll &amp; co~maundement in all thynges. For in the fyrst he desyreth of you surety for the peace, &amp; as to thys we answere thus. Ye haue but a doughter, and the Emperoure but a sone, wherfore let a maryage be made bytwene them, &amp; y^t may be a perpetuall sykernes of y^e peace. And also he asketh homage &amp; rentes whych is good to fulfyll. And than the kynge sente hys messen+gers to the Emperour, sayinge that he wyll fulfyll his ente~t in al thynge, yf it myght please his hyghnes that his sone &amp; the kynges doughter myght be wedded togy+der. All thys pleased well the Emperour, neuerthelesse he sente agayne, that yf his doughter were a clene vyr|gyn from her byrth vnto that daye, he wolde consent to that maryage. Than was the kyng ryght glad, for his doughter was a clene vyrgyn. Therfore wha~ y^e lettres of couenauntes &amp; sykernes were sealed, the kynge dyd do make araye a fayre shyppe, wherin he myght sende hys doughter with many noble knyghtes, ladyes and great rychesse vnto the Emperour for to haue hys sone in maryage. And whan they were saylynge in the see

And aboute thre of the clocke the tempest seaced, and the lady droue forth ouer the wawes in that broke~ shyppe whyche was cast vp agayn, but an huge whale folowed after, redy to deuoure bothe the shyppe &amp; her, wherfore thys fayre yonge lady whan nyght came she smote fyre wyth a stone, wherw^t the shyppe was great|ly lyghtned, &amp; than y^e wale durst not aue~ture towarde the shyppe for drede of the lyght. At the cocke crowynge thys yonge lady was so wery of the great tempest and trouble of the see that she slepte, &amp; wythin a lytel whyle the fyre was out, &amp; than came y^e whale &amp; deuoured her And whan she wakened and vnderstode her selfe in the whales bely she smote fyre, &amp; wythin a lytell whyle she wounded the whale wyth a knyfe in many places, and whan y^e whale felte hymselfe wounded, accordynge to hys nature began to swymme to la~de. There was that tyme dwellyng in that cou~tree an erle that was a noble man named Pyrrys, the whych bycause of recreacyon walked by the see strande, &amp; as he was walkyng thus he sawe where as the whale was co~mynge towarde y^e lande, wherfore he returned home agayne, &amp; gadered many stronge men &amp; women &amp; came thyder agayne, &amp; fought wyth thys whale, &amp; wounded hym sore, and as they smote the mayden that was in hys bely cryed w^t a hye voyce &amp; sayd.

And whan she was thus delyuered, she tolde hym forthw^t by ordre whose doughter she was, &amp; how she had lost all her goodes in the see, &amp; how she sholde haue ben ma+ryed vnto the Emperours sone. And whan y^e erle herde thys he was ryght glad, wherfore he conforted her the more, &amp; kepte her styll wyth hym tyll she was well re|freshed. And in the meane tyme he sente messengers to the Emperoure, lettynge hym wyte how thys kynges doughter was saued. Than was the Emperour ryght glad of her saluacyon &amp; co~myng, &amp; had great co~passyon on her, saying. A good mayde for y^e loue of mi sone thou hast suffred moche woo, neuerthelesse yf thou be wor|thy to be hys wyfe&punc; soone shall I preue. And whan he had thus sayd, he let brynge forth thre vessels, the fyrst was made of pure golde well couched wyth precyous stones wythout &amp; w^tin, full of deed mennes bones, and thervpon was wryten thys posey.

Thynkynge thus wythin her selfe, yf I chose thys vessell, what is wythin I knowe not, but well I wote there shall I fynde that nature desyreth, and my nature desyreth the lust of the flesshe, and ther|fore thys vessell wyll I not chose.

It befell afterwarde vpon a tyme that one Dionyse a tyraunt came in to the temple and toke awaye the rynge from the fyrst ymage, the berde from the seconde, &amp; the mantell from the thyrde.

After that whan I sawe the thyrde ymage closed in a mantell of golde, I thought that a mantell of golde was not behouable to hym in wynter, for golde is naturally colde, whyche myght because of his deth, and therfore I toke it from hym bycause it was to colde in wynter, and to hote in somer. Whan Dyonyse had excused hym by these rea|sons, the Emperoure answered and sayde.

Tha~ said y^e mayster of the shyppe, I loue thy lady more than I can tell the, for her fayrnes is so greate, that I wolde gyue for the loue of her all the golde that I haue, and yf I may op|tayne the loue of her thrugh thy helpe, I shall gyue the what so euer thou wylte desyre of me. Than sayd the ladyes seruaunt. Tell me by what meanes I may best spede. Than sayde the mayster of the shyppe. Go home to thy lady agayne and tell her that I wyll not delyuer the my cloth but yf she comme her selfe, but brynge her not to my shyppe but yf the wynde be good &amp; able, for than I purpose to lede her away.

And than the foster opened the gate, and receyued hym as worshypfully as he coude, &amp; set hym to hys supper, and serued hym honestly. And whan he had supped, the foster brought hym to hys chambre, and whan tyme was he wente to bedde.

And anone he fell a slepe agayne, and the seconde tyme he herde a voyce, sayinge vnto hym these wordes. Yelde, yelde, yelde.

And than he herde the thyrde voyce, sayinge these wordes thryes. Flee, flee, flee, for this nyght is a cyylde borne that after thy decese shall be Emperour. Whan the Emperoure herde thys, he wakened and wondred greatly what it myght be. In the mornynge erly folowynge the Emperoure arose, and called to hym the foster &amp; sayd. Dere frende I praye the that thou wylte tell me yf ony chylde be borne thys nyght to thy knowlege. My wyfe quod the foster thys nyght is delyuered of a fayre sone.

Whan the Emperoure had seen the chylde, he sawe a token in the chyldes visage, wherby he myght knowe hym an other tyme, and than he sayde to the foster thus. Dere frende knowest thou who I am. Nay sothly quod the foster, for I sawe you neuer before thys tyme, as farre as I am remembred, neuerthelesse it semeth that ye sholde be a gentylman. Than answered the Emperoure and

sayd. I am quod he the Emperour your lorde, whome ye haue lodged thys nyght, wherfore ryght hertely I thanke you. This hearynge the foster fell downe vpon bothe hys knees at his fete, and besought hym of mer|cy, yf that he had offended hys hyghnes in ony thynge prayinge hym of forgyuenes. Than answered y^e Em|perour &amp; sayde. Drede the not, for I thanke the hertely of thy good chere, &amp; thy sone that was borne to nyght I wyll haue for to nourysshe &amp; brynge vp in my courte and to morowe I shall sende for hym. A my gracyous lorde quod the foster, it is not agreable that suche a no+ble Emperour sholde nourysshe the chylde of hys sub|gecte and seruaunt, neuerthelesse your wyll be fulfyl|led, for whan your messengers comme I shall delyuer them my sone. Whan thys was sayde, the Emperoure toke hys leue and rode home towarde his palays. And whan he was comme home, he called vnto hym suche seruauntes as he trusted best, and sayde to them thus. Go ye quod he vnto my foster, wyth whome I was lodged thys nyght in the forest, and receyue of hym his sone, of whyche hys wyfe was delyuered thys nyght, and vpon payne of deth I commaunde you that ye flee hym by the waye, and cast hys flesshe to the dogges, but brynge wyth you the herte to me. And but ye ful|fyll my commau~dement, ye shall dye the moost foulest deth that can be thought. Anone hys seruau~tes wente to the forest and receyued the fosters sone, and brought hym wyth them.

O my good frendes heare my counseyle, and ye shall not forthynke it. Yf we murther thys innocent chylde we shall greatly offende almyghty god, therfore here be yonge pygges, sle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">we one of them, and than may we beare wyth vs hys herte, and present it vnto the Emperoure, sayinge that it is the herte of the chylde, and thus shall we not shede the chyldes blode.

Good frendes quod he, let vs wrappe hym in some clothes &amp; laye hym in some holowe tree, for perauenture god wyl helpe hym and saue hys lyfe. And whan he had thus sayd, they dyd gladly after hys counseyle in all thynges, and slewe the pygge, &amp; wente theyr waye and bare home with them the pygges hert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Emperoure, sayinge vnto hym thus.

meruaylled greatly why hys hou~des abode there, and smote his horse with the spurres and rode a great pace tyll he came to them. And whan he came vnto the tree wherin the chylde was layde, he loked in at an hole &amp; sawe there the chylde lyenge, and than was he ryght glad, and toke vp the chylde in hys armes full louyng|ly, and bare hym home vnto hys castell, sayinge vnto the countesse hys wyfe. Loo my dere wyfe, thys daye by fortune I haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ounde a full fayre chylde in an ho|lowe tree as I hunted in y^e forest, wherof I am ryght glad.

The countesse fulfylled ryght gladly the erles wyll and desyre, and sayde. My moost dere lorde, your wyll in thys thynge shall be done. Not longe after this tydynges wente thrugh out all that countree that the countesse was delyuered of a fay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e sone, wherfore eue|ry man made great ioye.

And at the daye assygned he came and brought the chylde w^t hym whyche was at that tyme a fayre yonge squyer, &amp; car|ued at the borde before the erle. The Emperour great|ly behelde hym, and espyed the token in hys for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heed whyche he had seen before in the fosters house&punc; wher|fore he was greatly moued &amp; vexed wythin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

and sayd vnto the erle in this wyse. Whose sone is this Sothly sayd the erle, he is my sone. Than sayd y^e Em|perour. By the fayth and trouth that thou owest vnto me, tell me the trouth. The erle seynge that he myght not excuse hymselfe by no maner wyse, but that nedes he must tell hym the trewth, than tolde he hym al togy+ther, how he had founde hym in the forest in an holowe tree. Thys hearyng the Emperoure, was almoost out of his ryght mynde for anger, and called vnto hym his seruauntes whyche he had sente before to slee y^e chylde. And whan they came before hym, he made them for to swere vpon a boke that they sholde tell hym the trouth what they had done wyth the chylde. Gracyous lorde sayde they, we put vs vnto your grace &amp; goodnes, for wythout doubte, pyte so moued vs, that we myght not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lee hym, and than we put hym in an holowe tree, but what afterwarde befell of hym, sothly we knowe not, and in his stede we slewe a pygge, and brought you the herte therof. Whan the Emperoure had herde the very trewth of thys mater, he sayd vnto y^e erle. Thys yonge man quod he, shal abyde here wyth me. The erle anone graunted, though it was greatly agaynst hys wyll. And whan the feest was ended, euery man toke hys leue at the Emperoure, and wente where as them lyst. And at that tyme it fortuned that the Empresse &amp; her doughter soiourned in a greate countre farre fro thens by the co~maundement of the Emperoure. It befell not longe after the Emperour called vnto hym that yonge squyer and sayde. The behoueth quod he, to ryde vnto the Empresse my wyfe wyth my letters. I am redy at your co~maundement my lorde sayde he, to fulfyll your

That the Empresse sholde take the bearer of these letters, and let hym be drawen at a horse tayle, and after that she sholde let hym be hanged tyll he were deed, and that vpon payne of deth. Whan the letters were all made and sealed, than the Empe|roure toke them vnto the yonge squyer, co~maundynge hym to spede hym on hys iourney. And anone y^e yonge squyer receyued them gladly, and put them sure in a boxe, and rode forth on his iourney. Whan he had ryd|den thre or foure dayes on his iourney, in an euenynge he came vnto a castell where as dwelled a knyght, and prayed hym mekely of a nightes lodynge. The knyght seynge and beholdynge the good fauour of thys yonge squyer, he graunted hym lodgynge, &amp; made hym good chere and well to fare, and afterwarde brought hym vnto hys chambre. And whan he was there he wente to bedde, and anone fell on slepe, for he was full wery of hys iourney, and forgate hys boxe wyth the letters lyenge openly in hys chambre. Whan the knyght sawe the boxe, he opened it, &amp; founde the letters sealed wyth the Emperours sygne manuell, and was greatly tem|pted to open them, and at the last he opened them full subtylly, and than he redde how the Empresse vpon payne of dethe sholde put the bearer of them to dethe, and than he was ryght sorowfull, &amp; sayde wythin hym selfe. Alas quod he, it is great pyte to slee suche a fayre yonge man, and therfore yf I may, it shall not be so. And anone the knyght scraped awaye that wrytynge and wrote in y^e same paper a letter sayinge these wor|des. Upon payne of deth I commaunde the that thou

Whan the knyght had thus wryten, he closed the letters subtylly &amp; put them in to the boxe agayne. Erly in the mornynge the yonge squyer arose and hastely made hym redy, and toke hys leue of the knyght, and rode forth on hys iourney, and the thyrde daye after he came vnto the Empresse, and salewed her ryght worshypfully in the Emperours be|halfe, and toke her the letters. And whan the Empresse had redde them, anone she sent her messengers thrugh the countree, co~maundynge the states and gentylmen to comme vnto her doughters weddynge at a certayne daye assygned. Whan they day was co~me thyder came many greate lordes and ladyes, and anone this yonge squyer wedded the Emperours doughter wyth great honour and worshyp, accordynge to the tenoure of the letters, and was ryght well beloued and moost honou+red amonge y^e people. Not longe after it befell that the Emperoure came in to that countre. And whan y^e Em|presse herde of her lordes co~mynge, she toke wyth her her sone in lawe wyth moche other people, and wente agaynst y^e Emperoure for to welco~me hym. Whan the Emperoure sawe thys yonge squyer ledynge the Em|presse hys wyfe, he was greatly moued wythin hym selfe, and sayde.
