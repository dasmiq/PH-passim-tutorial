<HEAD>TO THE VERY GODLY and right Noble Lady, my Lady <HI>Mary Stewart,</HI> Countesse of Marre.</HEAD>

Sundry others before mee, haue written learnedly and largely of this subiect, but I haue labou|red as farre as I could, to eschew coinci|dent doctrine, and haue principally inde|uoured my selfe, to search out such obser|uations, as through experience, by the

grace of God, I haue found most comfor|table for such as are exercised in consci|ence. And these (right Noble Lady) I haue beene bolde to Dedicate vnto your Honour, as vnto one who hauing obtained mercy of God, is through his grace, daily exercised in the spirituall warfare. Ac|cept it therefore as a testimonie of that loue and reuerence that I beare to that grace of God, which is manifest in you: for the encrease whereof I daily pray vn|to God, that he would confirme you to the end, and bring forward his owne worke in you to perfection.</P>

<P>The Lord doth in such sort bridle<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 9. 20. But God shall either bridle, or change, or confound their eni|mies.</NOTE> the rage of <HI>Laban,</HI> that albeit he mar|ched after <HI>Iacob</HI> more furiously then <HI>Iehu</HI> the sonne of <HI>Nimshi</HI> marched af|ter <HI>Iehoram,</HI> thinking to satisfie his dis|contented minde, by reducing <HI>Iacob</HI> to a greater slauery then hee was in be|fore: yet the Lord puts inhibition to
<PB N="3" REF="5">
the conclusions of his hart, and makes him faine to sue for <HI>Iacobs</HI> friendship, and to enter into a couenant of peace with him.</P>
<P>Yea, which is more comfortable, the Lord maketh <HI>Laban</HI> himselfe a preacher of Gods prouidence, in mer|cy watching ouer <HI>Iacob.</HI> Thus the Lord bridleth <HI>Laban,</HI> and sends him backe againe to his owne harme, without do|ing harme to <HI>Iacob,</HI> or any of his. And as to <HI>Esau</HI> the Lord in like manner changes his cruell Heart, and makes him fauourable to <HI>Iacob,</HI> so that the same hands wherwith once he thought to haue slaine him, embraces him, and with the same mouth that once vowed to haue his life, he kisses him: so sure are they vnto whom the Lord is a pro|tectour. For <HI>when the wayes of a man please the Lord he can make his enimies his friends.</HI></P>

<PB N="4" REF="6">
acquaints him euer with some new and singular Consolation. In the begin|ning of this Chapter, the Angels of the Lord appeared vnto <HI>Iacob,</HI> to com|fort him, they brought him in effect this message from the Lord: Feare not, O <HI>Iacob,</HI> the power and malice of thy brother <HI>Esau,</HI> for here are wee, the hoast of the liuing God to goe with thee, and assist thee, according to the promise of protection in thy iourney, that God made to thee in Bethel, wher|in thou sawest the Angels ascending and descending vpon the Ladder: we are now sent to waite vpon the; as wee conveyed thee in thy comming, so are wee now safely to convey thee in thy returning, in dispite of all that will op|pose themselues against thee.</P>
<P>This vision no doubt did confirme the heart of <HI>Iacob</HI> for a while, and en|couraged him to the journey: yet soone after he is troubled with a new feare. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">he report of his Messengers, who tolde him that <HI>Esau</HI> was comming a|gainst him with foure hundred men,

doth in such sort disquiet his mind, that hee forgets his former comforts, and he becomes exceedingly afraid.</P>
<P>And in this each one of vs, may<NOTE PLACE="marg">An image of our weaknesse.</NOTE> see an image of our owne weaknesse. <HI>Iacob</HI> had many proofes and experi|ences of Gods mercy, it is not long since he got joyfull deliuerance, from <HI>Laban,</HI> and since the Lord as I haue said, comforted him by the ministry of his Angels: and yet now behold how small a thing discourages him: certain|ly such is the weaknesse of the dearest Children of God, that it is not one confirmation, yea not many experien|ces of mercy, that will sustaine vs, but we haue neede continually and houre|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">We haue need that the Lord should e|uery day renew his mercies to|wards vs.</NOTE> to be strengthened with new grace of corroboration.

<P><HI>Abraham</HI> in <HI>Aegipt</HI> got a notable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not once, but often doe the godly fall, and that many times in one &amp; the selfe same sinne.</NOTE> proofe of the Lords prouident mercy waiting ouer him, preseruing <HI>Sarah</HI> in|violate, when he had exponed her cha|stitie to the concupiscence of an Eth|nike, king <HI>Pharaoh:</HI> but was this ex|perience of God his mercy sufficient to confirme him, and make him strong against the like tentation in time to come? No surely, for shortly thereaf|ter in <HI>Gerah,</HI> among the <HI>Philistines,</HI> he fals into the same sinne of fearefull di|strust; so that againe the second time hee seekes the preseruation of his life, by hazarding the chastitie of <HI>Sarah:</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="7" MS="y">
And that worthy Prophet <HI>Samuell,</HI> al|beit hee found many a time the Lords presence with him, assisting him in such sort, that he suffered none of his words to fall to the ground, yet when God commaunded him goe, and annoynt <HI>Dauid,</HI> he refused at the first, &amp; why? because he feared least <HI>Saul</HI> should slay him. Who would think that such weak|nesse had bin in the man of God, that hauing the word of the Lord for his warrant, he should yet be afraid of the countenance of man?

<P>NOtwithstanding, for this infirmity in <HI>Iacob</HI> the Lord doth not reiect him, but rather like a louing father, handles him so much the more tender|ly. It is the Lords praise and our com|fort, <HI>he breakes not the brused reed, and quenches not the smoaking flax, he is the God who comforts the abiect, and bindeth vp the broken in heart.</HI> It was not for <HI>Iacobs</HI> worthinesse, that the Lord did first chuse him, and now for his weak|nes hee will not reject him: therefore doth hee now appeare to <HI>Iacob</HI> in his need, and minister vnto him greater comfort then any he got before. In the beginning of the Chapter, the Lord sent his Angels, his ministring spirits to comfort him; and now because <HI>Iacob</HI> yet is in feare, in the end of the Chapter, ye

see how he comes himselfe, and com|forts him.

And therefore, for the better vnderstanding of it, and giuing greater light to the whole storie, in the entry we shall per|mit these three things God willing.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> The cause mouing the Lord to ap|peare to Iacob, at this time.</HEAD>
<P>THe cause mouing the Lord to ap|peare to <HI>Iacob,</HI> was the hard estate wherein his seruant stood at this time. For <HI>Iacob</HI> is now in great anguish of minde, tumbling as it were betweene feare and confidence, betweene hope and despaire: hope bidding him goe forward in his iourney, despaire by the contrary disswading him; confidence promising him safetie, feare threatning him with danger. His hope leanes on the word of God, who promised to be with him, and prosper him: his feare is conceiued of the words of <HI>Esau,</HI> who had vowed to slay him, and is now wakened againe, and augmented by the report of his seruants, who tolde him, that <HI>Esau</HI> was comming against<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iacobs per|plexitie.</NOTE> him with an army. Thus did he walk staggering vpon feet, not vnlike the
<PB N="12" REF="10">
feet of <HI>Daniels</HI> Image, <HI>partly of clay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan.</NOTE> <HI>partly of iron.</HI> Some of his thoughts be|ing weake and impotent; others strong and forcible to carry him forward. In this perplexitie now sta~ds <HI>Iacob,</HI> hauing no conclusion nor counsell within him without contradiction, vncertaine what to doe, or which way to turne him; not vnlike <HI>Iehosophat,</HI> which being straited<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chro. 20</NOTE> with the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites, stood vp before the Lord and said, <HI>O Lord there is no strength in vs, to stand against this great multitude, neither doe wee know what to doe, but our eyes are towards thee.</HI> In like man|ner say I, doth <HI>Iacob</HI> here, being as|saulted with a force hee was not able to resist, hee turnes him to the Lord, and expon&eacute;s to the Lord in humble manner his feare: <HI>Deliuer me O Lord from the hand of my brother</HI> Esau, <HI>for I feare him, least hee come vpon me, and smite me, and the mother vpon the chil|dren.</HI> Therfore is it that now the Lord comes, as in due season and conuenient time, to shew himselfe for the comfort
<PB N="13" REF="10" MS="y">
of his seruant. No helpe for <HI>Iacob</HI> in man, the Lord puts to his right hand, &amp; comforts him. <HI>Ibi enim incipit diuinu~</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The help of God be|gins when other help failes.</NOTE> <HI>auxilium, vbi deficit humanum.</HI> When all other helpes failes the Children of God, then commeth in the helpe of God, for he knows best the very point and article of time, wherein it is meete that hee should bee the diliuerer of them who wayt vpon him.</P>
<P>As to the manner of the apparition, the Lord is not content to answere<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ner of the Lords ap|parition is both by word and vision.</NOTE> <HI>Iacob</HI> by word onely, nor by sending secretly patience and comfort vnto his troubled spirit (which way many a time he answeres the prayers of his owne) but he confirmes him by an extraordi|nary vision. For he appeares to <HI>Iacob,</HI> in the forme of a man, and wrestles with him, he assayes him not with a superi|our strength which he was not able to withstand, but applies himselfe to <HI>Ia|cobs</HI> weaknesse, and disposes the wrest|ling in such a manner, that <HI>Iacob</HI> gets the victory, albeit not without a wound, for his thigh-bone is disjoynted, and
<PB N="14" REF="11">
put out of the joynt, so that he haulteth all the dayes of his life: which as for the present time it was a matter of his humiliation, being a discouery of his weaknes, and of the Lords indulgence, whereby onely he preuailed victor in the combat, so was it for all time to come, a memoriall and remembrance vnto him of this most comfortable ap|parition.</P>
<P>And as to the end of the Lords ap|pearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Lords ap|parition is Iacobs co~|firmation.</NOTE> the end, saith <HI>Theodoret,</HI> was the confirmation of <HI>Iacobs</HI> hart against feare; <HI>ideo enim Angelus cu~</HI> Iacob <HI>lucta|ri voluit, vt timenti fratrem fiduciam inij|ceret.</HI> And this ye may perceiue out of the words which the Lord vtters when the wrestling is ended, <HI>thou hast wrest|led with God, and shalt also preuaile with men.</HI> Feare not therefore (will the Lord say) O my seruant <HI>Iacob,</HI> to en|counter with <HI>Esau,</HI> who is but a mor|tall man; I, who haue furnished thee with strength to stand in this wrestling with GOD, shall furnish thee with strength also in all thy conflicts vvith
<PB N="15" REF="11">
men, and thou shalt preuaile. This is the ground of all our comfort in trou|ble, which if we could remember, then would we not be cast downe nor dis|quieted with feares,, <HI>but would sanctifie</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 8. 13.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord of hosts in our hearts, and make him our feare.</HI> It is not in our name, nor strength, nor in the power of nature that we stand and wrestle. We go forth against our <HI>Goliah</HI> in the name of our God, weake in our selues, yet in him <HI>more then Conquerours: Maior enim est</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyp. lib. 2 epist. 6.</NOTE> <HI>qui prae est in nobis, quam qui in hoc mun|do, nec plus ad deijoiendum potest terre|na poena, quam ad erigendum diuina tu|tela.</HI> He is stronger that rules in vs, then the Prince of this world, Neyther are these euils which earthly men are able to inflict vpon vs, so forcible to cast vs downe, as the heauenly helpe is able to raise vs vp: let vs alwayes walke forward in this our strength. <HI>The Lord</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 27.</NOTE> <HI>is my light and saluation, the Lord is the strength of my life, of whom then shall I be afraid.</HI></P>
<P>But now, before that yet wee enter
<PB N="16" REF="12">
into the particulars, let vs marke this profitable lesson, that vpon the grou~ds I haue laid, arise to be obserued. If wee consider what is the Lords purpose<NOTE PLACE="marg">How mer|uailously God in dealing with his children workes by contraries.</NOTE> and intention, what againe are the meanes that he vseth to bring about his purpose: and yee shall see that the Lord vseth meanes, which appeares contrary to his end. His purpose is to confirme <HI>Iacob,</HI> the meanes hee vseth, is wrestling with <HI>Iacob,</HI> a strange man|ner of working, that the Lord should shake him hee mindes to strengthen, that he should wound him whom hee purposes to confirme: and thus, and this manner of way on a sodaine, terri|fie by a strange wrestling in the night, &amp; in a solitary place, his seruant, whom hee came to comfort; but so it is, the working of the Lord oft times is by contraries. In the first worke of crea|tion, hee made all things of nothing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">So did hee worke in them the worke of creation.</NOTE> <HI>He commanded light to shine out of dark|nesse.</HI> Hee formed the body of man, his most excellent earthly creature, of the basest matter dust and clay; of the vilest
<PB N="17" REF="12">
creature, hee made the most honoura|ble, and all to shew the glory of his power. In the worke of redemption in<NOTE PLACE="marg">So also in the work of redemp|tion.</NOTE> like manner, our Sauiour Iesus by su|staining shame, hath conquered to vs, glory; by induring the Crosse, hath ob|tayned the crowne; by suffering death, hath destroyed death, and him who had the power thereof: and after the<NOTE PLACE="marg">And so daily in his Saints Psal.</NOTE> same manner of working, hee is yet daily <HI>meruailous in his Saints:</HI> By death he brings them vnto life; <HI>He kils and he makes aliue.</HI> Through doubtings hee leads them to assurance; by temporall despaire hee brings them to abound in hope; he afrayes them with his terrors, to make them the more capable of his consolations. It is strange and meruai|lous in our eyes; may not wee learne it by daily experience, that God deli|uereth vs from Sathan, by letting Sa|than loose for a while vpon vs? Hee saues vs from our sinnes, by gathering all our sins against vs, and laying them to the charge of our conscience, and by a present feeling of his wrath, hee
<PB N="18" REF="13">
maketh vs flee that terrible Wrath which is to come.</P>
<P>Be not therefore discouraged, yee<NOTE PLACE="marg">We should not there|fore be dis|couraged when God seemes vn|couth and strange to vs.</NOTE> who finde this working of the Lord, faint not though the Lord after this manner doe exercise you, that when ye cry for mercy, yet to your feeling ye ap|prehend nothing but anger: reuerence the working of God, suppose for the present yee vnderstand it not; let the Lord walke on his owne way, and wait thou with patience for comfort in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal.</NOTE> end, <HI>the Lord will send a gracious raine vpon his inheritance to refresh it, when it is weary: though he kill vs, he shall make vs to liue againe.</HI> When he hath humb|led vs to the graue, yet will he raise vs againe. <HI>After two dayes he will reuiue vs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hose. 6.</NOTE> <HI>and in the third he shall raise vs vp, and we shall liue in his sight.</HI> It is no rotten foundation we leane to; <HI>the foundation</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tim.</NOTE> <HI>of the Lord remaines sure,</HI> &amp; therefore, <HI>albeit the Lord should s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ay vs yet will we trust in him.</HI> He sent a fearefull darknes on <HI>Abraham</HI> or euer hee shewed him<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genesis.</NOTE> the comfortable vision.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> The first circumstance, the time of the wrestling.</HEAD>
<P>AS to the first, the circumstance of<NOTE PLACE="marg">1</NOTE> time is noted by <HI>Moses, when</HI> Ia|cob (sayth he) <HI>was left alone.</HI> Amongst many reasons that might moue <HI>Iacob</HI> to bee alone, I encline to none more then this: he sought to be solitary, to the end he might haue the fitter occa|sion to pray, and poure out his griefe the more freely and homely into the Lords bosome. For we know that the presence of men is oftentimes a great impediment of the free communing of our soules with God, and that the chil|dren of God will boldly communicate
<PB N="22" REF="15">
those secrets to the Lord, which they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Solitarines conueni|ent for prayer.</NOTE> will not vtter to their dearest friends. We haue here then to learne with <HI>Ia|cob,</HI> sometime to with-draw our selues from the dearest company of men, that wee may haue the better occasion by prayer to conferre with our God, <HI>For hee who loueth wisedome, will separate himselfe to seeke it.</HI> Yet are wee to re|member,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And yet solitarines auailes not without inward at|tention.</NOTE> that solitarinesse auailes not without, vnlesse there be silence with|in: For though the body bee remoued from the eyes of men, if the soule in the meane time bee disquieted with bands of restlesse and troublesome mo|tions, it is not possible that we can pray. <HI>Maxima est segnitia, alienari &amp; capi</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cypr de orat. dom.</NOTE> <HI>ineptis cogitationibus, cum Dominum de|precaris, quasi sit aliquid, quod magis de|beas cogitare, quam quod cum Deo lo|quaris, quomodo te audiri &agrave; Deo postulas, cum te ipse non audias, vis Deum memo|rem esse tui cum rogas, cum tu ipse me|mor tui non sis, hoc est ab hoste in totum non cauere, hoc est vigilare oculis &amp; corde dormire, cum debeat Christianus, etiam</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="15">
<HI>cum dormit oculus, corde vigilare.</HI> It is (saith <HI>Cyprian</HI>) a very great sloath to be alienate and carried away with vnmeet cogitations, when thou prayest vnto God: as if there were any thing wher|of thou shouldest thinke more then this, that thou art speaking with God. How desirest thou that God should heare thee, when thou hearest not thy selfe? or that hee should be mindefull of thee, who art not mindefull of thy selfe? By so doing, thou art not warie enough of thy enimie, this is to watch with thine eyes and sleepe with thy heart, whereas it becommeth a Chri|stian euen to wake with the hart, when the eye is asleepe: <HI>I sleepe but my heart</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant.</NOTE> <HI>waketh.</HI></P>
<P>When therefore we goe to pray, we<NOTE PLACE="marg">What pre|paration should goe before prayer.</NOTE> must doe as did our Sauiour, when he went to raise <HI>Tabitha</HI> from the dead, he put the Minstrels and the Mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ners to the doore; and wee must put worldly thoughts out of our mindes, tollerable seruants (if so be wee vse them as ser|uants) at another time, but no way

tollerable in the time of prayer: Like the Asses and Seruants of <HI>Abraham,</HI> which he vsed as helpes to carry him forward in his journey, but left them at the foote of the mountaine, when he went vp to pray, and sacrifice to the Lord. And thus the perturbations of our mindes within being quieted, then let vs eschew as farre as possibly wee can, all occasions of distractions with|out vs. Let vs with his spouse in the Canticles, <HI>follow our Husband to the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant.</NOTE> <HI>fields,</HI> and there talke with him: or with <HI>Dauid, let vs examine our hearts vpon</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 4.</NOTE> <HI>our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eds, and be still:</HI> or as our Sauiour<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 6. 5.</NOTE> commandeth vs: <HI>Let vs enter into our chamber, and shut the doore, and there in secret pray to our heauenly father.</HI> Af|ter this manner went <HI>Daniel</HI> to his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan.

<P>The Lord therefore encrease in vs<NOTE PLACE="marg">True pray|er alwayes returnes with profit to vs.</NOTE> this delight &amp; disposition to pray, that we may esteeme it a benefit &amp; vantage to vs to haue the least occasion to pray, for it was neuer yet seene but that a hart to pray hath euer been an vndoub|ted forerunner of a speciall blessing of God to ensue. <HI>If we open our mouth</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal.</NOTE> <HI>wide the Lord shall fill it:</HI> seeking must

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> The second circumstance, the persons betweene whom the wrestling is.</HEAD>
<P>THe second thing that here comes<NOTE PLACE="marg">2</NOTE> to be considered, is the persons, betweene whom the wrestling is. Hee that wrestles here with <HI>Iacob,</HI> is not a Man, albeit <HI>Moses</HI> so calleth him, be|cause so hee appeares: neither is hee a created Angell, albeit <HI>Hosea</HI> call him an Angell of God. But hee who wrestles is the sonne of God, the great Angell of the couenant, <HI>hic homo verus Deus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chris. in Gen. 32.</NOTE> <HI>est, non ex nuncupatione, sed natura:</HI> hee it is, who in this combat is the wrestler with <HI>Iacob.</HI></P>
<P>Where first it is to bee demanded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How as ma~ Christ appeared to the Fa|thers be|fore his in|carnation.</NOTE> how it is that Iesus Christ appeared to the Fathers vnder the law, in forme and shape of a man, hee not being yet in|carnate and made man indeede. The answere is, that appearing of Christ in forme of a man, was as <HI>Tertullian</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="18">
calleth it, <HI>praeludiu~ humanitatis,</HI> a presig|nation of his manifestation after in the flesh: but there is a great difference be|tween the appearing &amp; his incarnation that followed, <HI>in the fulnesse of time.</HI> For<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal.</NOTE> first, albeit christ before his incarnation tooke on verely the body of man, yet<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference betweene Christs apparition and his manifesta|tio~ after in the flesh.</NOTE> was he not then a man indeede, he was not then <HI>of the seed the woman,</HI> but whe~ fulnesse of time came, God sent his son into the world made of a woman, <HI>then the word was made flesh:</HI> then tooke he on the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> &amp; became <HI>in al things man like vnto vs except sin:</HI> then hee assumed our nature, and joyned it into one subsistance vvith his diuine nature, that is, into one personall vnion, for the straitnesse of the which conjun|ction, it is sayd, and most truely, that Christ Iesus Man is God, and Christ Iesus God is Man: vvhich before his incarnation could not be said of him. Secondly, vvhereby Christ vnder the lavv tooke on the body of man, was but temporall, and for the doing of some particular errand, vvhich so soone as he
<PB N="29" REF="18">
had finished, he laid away againe. But Christ Iesus hath now assumed the na|ture of man, neuer to be laid away a|gaine: as hee hath joyned our nature vvith his diuine nature in a personall vnion, so also in an euerlasting vnion; so that there shall neuer be a separation betweene them.</P>
<P>Alway in this manner of Christs ap|pearing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christs loue is seene in his familiar apparition to the fa|thers be|fore the Law.</NOTE> vnto <HI>Iacob,</HI> &amp; other of his ser|uants before the law: let vs take vp the loue of Iesus toward his owne, that for their sake hee is content to abase his majestie, and appeare to his seruants, not in a shape answerable to his glory, but in such a forme as their weakenes might best comport vvith: for vvhat kind of more homely and familiar ap|parition can God vse to man, than to appeare as a man, in the shape most fa|miliar to man? Not as God clad with glory and Majestie, for that way no flesh might abide him. In this O Lord thou hast shewed thy goodnes to man: in this our father <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> had a proofe of thy louing kind|nesse:

<P>But what is all this, if it be compa|red<NOTE PLACE="marg">But more aboundant ly hath he shewed his loue to vs in this last age.</NOTE> with that which after followed, I doe meane with that great loue, which now in this last age of the world, ac|cording to the truth of his promises he hath shewed vnto his Church, in that he hath kept the precise, promised, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iraen. contra Val lib. 3 cap. 28.

Hee came downe from the bosome of his Father, as the great Angell of his counsell, to reueale to vs his fathers will concerning our saluation. It is not customable, that honourable persona|ges should come to the poorer, but his compassion of our necessities constray|ned him: <HI>Iacentes enim paralytici in grab|bato,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bern. de aduentu.

<P>Hereof then commeth our standing in these inward conflicts of conscience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 13</NOTE> that <HI>our faithfull God suffers vs not to be tempted abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> our power:</HI> he assailes vs not aboue our strength: <HI>he sets not our</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 50.</NOTE> <HI>sinnes in order before vs,</HI> that wee should see them as we committed them.

mittigates the stroke of his rod, &amp; ex|tenuates the pith of his hand, when hee puts at vs. And with this also by his se|cret grace he vnderprops vs; otherwise no power should bee found in weake man, to stand in the meanest of these battels, wherein God sheweth himselfe our aduersarie party.

<P>IN the third roome wee promised to speake of the manner of this wrest|ling, whether it bee corporall onely, or spirituall onely, or mixed.

<P>THou therefore whose heart is set to seeke the Lord, &amp; in this perplexi|tie wouldst know what to doe and how to behaue thy selfe, I can no better way resolue thee, then to send thee to looke vnto <HI>Abraham, Iacob, Iob,</HI> and the rest of these, who haue been exercised with the like tentations before thee. Marke therefore, and consider how the Lord commanded <HI>Iacob</HI> to go backe againe vnto <HI>Canaan,</HI> and promised to be with
<PB N="52" REF="30">
him; yet now in the iourney (as it would seeme) he comes against him. He bad him goe forward and yet disioynts his thigh bone, &amp; so vnables him to goe as he was wont. Notwithstanding <HI>Iacob</HI> still cleaues fast to the promise of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 By Iacob.</NOTE> Lord, being perswaded that the Lord could not faile him; and therefore con|trary to his present sence and feeling, trusting still on the word of the Lord, for all the appearing contrarietie of his working, he craues a blessing from him that wrestles vvith him.</P>
<P>Againe, will ye looke vnto <HI>Abra|ham</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 By Abra|ham.</NOTE> our father? the Lord made him a promise, that in <HI>Isaac,</HI> his seed should be blessed, and yet hee commands him to slay him. A wonderfull tentation, that the Lord commands him to slay that child, in whom hee had promised the multiplication and blessing of his posteritie: for here the promise of God &amp; his commandement seemes to fight together. Yet <HI>Abraham</HI> strengthned in the faith, as he receiued <HI>Isaac</HI> from the dead wombe of <HI>Sara,</HI> doth not doubt
<PB N="53" REF="30">
but God was able to raise him from the dead againe; and therefore resting on the Lords promise, he spares not to sa|crifice <HI>Isaac,</HI> being fully assured that the Lordes apparant contrary working, could no way be prejudiciall to the ve|ritie of his word. O strong! O rare! O wonderfull Faith! Therefore the Lord who giueth no vaine stiles to his seruants, honoureth <HI>Abraham</HI> with this name, <HI>the father of the faithfull.</HI> For by his example, our weakenes is strength|ned to giue credit to the Lord, when he speaketh to vs.</P>
<P>And the same lesson of Faith, is in<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 By Iacob.</NOTE> like manner taught vnto vs, by the ex|ample of patient <HI>Iob</HI> (for many school|masters and examples haue wee on whom the ends of the world are fal|len.) No doubt he had laid vp the pro|mises of God in his heart, whereupon he dependeth: yet doth the Lord han|dle him sohardly, both in body and minde, as if hee were determinate to keepe no promise vnto him. Yet <HI>Iob</HI> for all this distrusts not the truth of
<PB N="54" REF="31">
Gods promise, but gripes them so sure|ly, that in his greatest extremitie he re|solues, <HI>O Lord, albeit thou shouldest slay me, yet will I trust in thee.</HI> That is albeit Lord thou shouldst deale hardlier with me then thou hast done, yet will I ne|uer thinke but thou wilt bee mercifull to me according to thy promise: there is a heart knit to the Lord; there is a soule cleaning to God without separa|tion, that thus concludes. O Lord, none of thy workes shall make me to misbeleeue thy word: though thou cast me downe to hell, my eye shall bee vpward towards thee, &amp; my soule shall loue thee, euen when it appeares thou saist that thou hast no delight in me.</P>

A notable wrest|ler was <HI>Dauid,</HI> yet got he sundry times the foyle.

A nota|ble wrestler also was the Apostle <HI>Paul:</HI> many rare reuelations receiued hee of the Lord, much did he in his calling, to draw many to righteousnesse; hee laboured more abundantly then all the rest of the Apostles: he founded pow|erfully that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">umpet, which cast downe the wals of spirituall <HI>Iericho</HI> whereso|euer hee came: so that from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> to <HI>Illyricum</HI> hee made the Gospell of Christ to abound.

<P><HI>FOr the Morning appeareth.</HI> These words containe the reason why the Lord desires that <HI>Iacob</HI> should let him goe, because the Morning appeareth. This at the first seemes a strange rea|son. Is it not a like to thee O Lord to abide with thy seruants in the morning
<PB N="75" REF="41">
as in the euening? or is there O Lord with thee any such distinction of time?

But we must consider that this reason respecteth not the Lord, it respecteth <HI>Iacob,</HI> and so the meaning is. It is for thy cause O my seruant <HI>Iacob,</HI> that I desire to goe, for now the morning appeareth, and thou must goe on in thy journey, thy ser|uants &amp; family will wait for thy com|ming, as being vncertain whether they shall remoue or remaine, till thou di|rect them, and therefore that I be no more to stay thee from them, let me go.</P>

<P>This is the reason, why the Lord dispenses in such sort his presence, and absence vnto his Children.

<P><HI>WHo answered I will not let thee goe.</HI> Perceiue here, how the mint of the Lords departure workes into <HI>Ia|cob</HI> a more constant cleauing, and ad|hering to the Lord. This as I said be|fore, is that notable fruite which all the Lords spirituall desertions worketh in
<PB N="80" REF="44">
his children; it augments in them a de|sire of mercie, and a more earnest care|fulnesse to seeke the Lord. And this also wee see in our dayly experience: for among all them, who professe the name of Iesus Christ, yee shall finde none more feruent in praier, more con|tinuall in mourning and sighing for their sinnes, none that thirsteth more earnestly for mercie, then they, whom God hath humbled in their spirits, with threatnings of spirituall desertion. As here <HI>Iacob</HI> is more wakened by this one word, <HI>Let me goe,</HI> then by all the rest of the wrestling, so is there nothing goeth so neere the heart of the godly, as doth the mint of the Lords depar|ture from them; they are neuer so lo|uing to him as at those times, when hee seemeth to count least of them: if hee looke angerly vpon them, the more pittifully looke they vnto him: if hee threaten them, they threaten kind|nesse vpon him: the hardlier that hee answeres them the more importunately doe they cry vpon him. Then with
<PB N="81" REF="44">
<HI>Dauid they water their couch with tears, and call vpon God all the day long. Their</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lam. 1. 14.</NOTE> <HI>eyes cast out water continually, when the comforter that should refresh their soules, is away from them.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, these desertions worke in Gods children a diuorcement of their soules from the delight of euery crea|ture, &amp; a straiter adherence to himselfe: when he threatens to goe from them, they follow him with these lamentable voyces, <HI>turne againe O Lord, and cause thy face to shine vpon me, that I may bee saued.</HI> O Lord take from me what thou wilt, take from me all the worldly com|forts, that euer thou gauest me, onely let me enioy thy selfe; <HI>for whom haue I in the heauens but thee? and I haue desired none in the earth with thee; my flesh farles me and my hart also, Lord faile thou me neuer: when thou hidest thy face I am sore troubled, returne therefore O Lord and be merciful to me, be thou the strength of my heart, and my portion for euer, for thy louing kindnesse is better then Life.</HI> These are the effects of sanctified
<PB N="82" REF="45">
trouble, while I haue marked, that wee may be comforted, &amp; not discouraged, when we finde that our outward or in|vvard troubles produce into vs a loa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> thing of earthly pleasure, and a more feruent loue of our God.</P>
<P>We haue yet more narrowly to con|sider<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is a striuing with God acceptable to him, &amp; namely, when wee will take no refusall of that that God hath promised.</NOTE> this answere that <HI>Iacob</HI> giues to the Lord: <HI>I will not</HI> (saith hee) <HI>let thee goe,</HI> Is this a seemely answere for a ser|uant to giue vnto his Lord? when the Lord sayes let mee goe, becomes it <HI>Ia|cob</HI> to answere I vvill not let thee goe? Is this good religion, in any thing to striue with the Lord? Yea indeede, ther are some things wherein the Lord is very well content that thou striue vvith him; as namely, when the Lord hath promised any thing vnto thee, and thou hast his word for thy warrant, to seeke it in sort, that albeit the Lord say thee nay, yet thou wilt receiue no refu|sall at his hands: this is a strife, which pleaseth the Lord, for in effect it is no other thing but a constant affirmation, that his truth is inuiolable. After this
<PB N="83" REF="45">
manner, that woman of <HI>Canaan</HI> stroue with him, she would take no deniall of that which he had promised: and af|ter this manner, here also <HI>Iacob</HI> striues with him, hee will not be denied of a blessing. And <HI>Moses</HI> also stroue with the Lord, protesting he would not go forward one foote, vnlesse the Lord went with him; because the Lord had so promised. But farre be it from vs to striue with the Lord, as the wicked do, grieuing him dayly with our murmur|ings and rebellions, still liuing in con|trarie tearmes with the Lord. <HI>Woe bee to him, that striueth with his maker, doe yee prouoke the Lord vnto anger? or are yee stronger then hee?</HI> The end of this strife to them wil be horrible confusion</P>
<P>There is yet farther to be considered in these words of <HI>Iacob,</HI> how hee saith to the Lord, <HI>I will not let thee goe;</HI> by what meane is this, that <HI>Iacob</HI> is able to hold, and detaine the Lord? The Pro|phet <HI>Hosea</HI> will resolue this: It was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nothing in the world so strong as the prayer of the god|ly, for they are the bands vvhereby the Lord is holden &amp; detained.</NOTE> (saith hee) by mourning, and weeping that <HI>Iacob</HI> preuailed, and helde the
<PB N="84" REF="46">
Angel, whilst he got the blessing. Ther is nothing so strong in the world, as the prayers of the godly, they are the onely bands, by which the Lord is holden, and detained: the Lord will not be re|strained by all the powers of the earth, neither will he cease to doe any worke, that he is about to doe, for the cries of all the men in the world: yet the pray|ers of his children are able to constrain him, to power downe an vndeserued blessing, and turne away a iust deser|ued punishment. When the people of <HI>Israell</HI> had fallen from God by wor|shipping the golden Calfe, the Lords anger was highly incensed, and kindled against them, which moued <HI>Moses</HI> to fall downe on his face before the Lord, beseeching him to bee appeased to|wards his people, for the glory of his name. This prayer did in such sort constraine the Lord in the midst of his anger, that he is compelled to say vnto <HI>Moses, Let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, for I will consume them.</HI> This manner of speach vsed by
<PB N="85" REF="46">
the Lord, declares that the prayer of <HI>Moses</HI> did bind and hold in the wrath of God, that it brake not out vpon this people. In like manner we read in the Gospell, that when Iesus was passing by those two blinde men, who cryed vpon him, <HI>Osanna, thou sonne of Dauid haue mercy vpon vs:</HI> albeit the multi|tude regarded not their crying, and the disciples also (as it seemes) tooke little thought thereof, yet Iesus was moued thereby to stand still. They could not come neere for the multitude to lay hands on him, but their prayers reach|ed vnto him, &amp; doth so take hold vpon him, that by that place he could not goe, vntill he had giuen them a comfortable answere, <HI>the prayer of a righteous man a|uatles</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam.</NOTE> <HI>much, if it be powred out in faith.</HI></P>

<P>But here againe it is to bee asked,

how sayes <HI>Iacob</HI> he saw the face of god;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what sense saith Iacob, hee saw the face of God.</NOTE> seeing the Lord gaue <HI>Moses</HI> this an|swere when hee sought a sight of his face? <HI>No man can see me and liue:</HI> and we know that <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist saith, <HI>No man hath seene God at any time, but the sonne, who is come from the bosome of the Father he hath reuealed him.</HI> How is it then I say, that <HI>Iacob</HI> here saith, <HI>I haue seene God face to face.</HI></P>
<P>I answere, that this is spoken in com|parison of other visions and reuelati|ons made to <HI>Iacob</HI> before: his mean|ing is no other but that hee had now seene the Lord, by a more excellent and notable manner of apparition, then euer he had seene before. And where <HI>Moses</HI> is said to haue seene the Lord face to face, this is only spoken in com|parison of <HI>Moses</HI> with other Prophets, who had not so cleare a reuelation of the Majestie of God, as <HI>Moses</HI> had: this is euident out of the Lords owne words. <HI>If there be a Prophet of the Lord among you, I will be knowne to him by a vision, and speake to him by a dreame: my</HI>

<HI>seruant</HI> Moses <HI>is not so: who is faithfull in all my house, to him will I speak mouth to mouth, not in darke wordes, and hee shall see the similitude of the Lord.</HI> Yea, let no man thinke, because of these<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neuer any man on the earth, saw the Lord as he is.</NOTE> words, that any of the Fathers saw the Lord as hee is; thou canst not see the Sunne as it is. Hee that a farre off lookes to the sea, sayes truely that hee hath seene the sea: but what is it that hee sees, in respect of that which hee seeth not? Yea wee cannot see a mor|tall man as he is; and how then shall wee see the Lord, as hee is? If the Fa|thers had seene the Lord as he is, then all the fathers had seene him one man|ner of way; because God in himselfe, is one, simple, and vndiuided essence: but they saw him many manner of wayes, in diuers so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">mes, and apparitions.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVII.</HI> What sight of God shall wee haue in the heauens?</HEAD>
<P>YEt I speake not this to take away that sight of God, which wee shall haue in the heauens. It must bee true which the Apostle saith, <HI>Wee shall see him as he is,</HI> it being vnderstood with these restrictions: First, the sight of God vvhich vve shall haue in heauen, shall bee perfect in respect of vs; the Lord shall dwell in vs fully, and reple|nish euery power and facultie of soule and body, vvith his joyfull presence. Hee shall fill my whole minde with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">is light, no darknesse shall bee left in it: he shall quicken my whole heart, no more deadnesse shall bee in it; and the whole affections shall bee replenished with his peace and joy. Now the Lord<NOTE PLACE="marg">1</NOTE> dwels in vs, but he fils vs not. Wee are yet hungry and thirstie: <HI>Wee know</HI> but in part, but in the heauens wee shall
<PB N="139" REF="73">
be filled perfectly with that presence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It shall be a perfect sight in respect of vs.</NOTE> <HI>wherein is the fulnesse of ioy:</HI> the Lord shall then be <HI>all things, in all vnto vs.</HI></P>
<P>Now the greatest measure of the sence of mercy, is called by the holy spirit <HI>a tasting, tast and consider how gra|cious the Lord is:</HI> but there is promised vnto vs a full satisfaction; <HI>ye shall bee sa|tisfied: Inebriabor ab vbertate domus tuae,</HI> I call this sight perfect in respect of vs, the Lord shall fill all that is in vs, wee shall desire no more, but we shall not be able to comprehend all that is in the Lord. <HI>Augustine</HI> expresseth this by a proper similitude: for he compares the godly in the heauens, to vessels cast in|to the sea, were they neuer so large they shall be filled full of water; and yet that which they containe is nothing, in com|parison of that great aboundance which is about them. So euery godly man glorified in heauen, shall be fully filled with gods comfortable presence, so that hee shall know no want, and yet shall he not be able to comprehend that in|finit majestie, and peace, and joy, and
<PB N="140" REF="74">
glory of the incomprehensible God. Therefore said I, that in respect of vs, wee shall haue in the heauens a perfect sight of God, that is, so farre as we can bee capable of him, <HI>Mensuram plenam, &amp; superfluentem tunc dabit in sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s ve|stros.</HI> A good measure, prest and run|ning ouer, saith our Sauiour, shall bee<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke.</NOTE> then giuen into your bosomes.</P>
<P>Secondly, that sight of God, that in<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 It shall be an imme|diate sight.</NOTE> heauen wee shall injoy, shall bee im|mediate, and this is such a sight, as none can vnderstand till wee get it. Yet to make it as plaine as we may, let vs com|pare it with that which we haue here in earth. The sight that now we haue of God, is as <HI>through a glasse or a vaile,</HI> that is, by mediate reuelations. Now vvee know him, by seeing him in his Crea|tures: wee know him, by hearing him in his word: we know him also euen in the earth, by spirituall meditation, that begetteth some secret sense of his mercy: yet al these are a <HI>walking by faith, not by sight,</HI> at the least, but a dark sight of God, and through couerings: but
<PB N="141" REF="74">
in the heauen we shall see him, not by halues, but by an immediate sight, which wee shall then best vnderstand (as I sayd) when we shall attaine vnto it. The Lord of his mercy purge and prepare vs in time, and then hasten<NOTE PLACE="marg">No sight of God in heauen ex|cept first we see him in earth. And here|unto there things are required.</NOTE> that day wherein we shall see him.</P>
<P>And yet because eternall life must be begunne on the earth, and that it is not possible wee can see God in the heauen, vnles wee haue first seene him in the earth; let vs take heed vnto those three things whereby wee may attaine vnto the sight of God. First remember that God without his own light cannot<NOTE PLACE="marg">The light of his word.</NOTE> beseen: the eye suppose it be an organe of sight, were it neuer so quicke, seeth nothing in the darke; the Sunne, with|out the Sunne cannot bee seene: farre lesse can the Lord be seene without the Lord. <HI>In light</HI> (saith the Psalmist) <HI>shall we see light.</HI> If therefore we would be|gin<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal.</NOTE> to see the Lord, <HI>let vs walke in his light,</HI> making his word a lanthorne to our feete in all our wayes, taking heede vnto it, as vnto <HI>a most sure word,</HI> and a
<PB N="142" REF="75">
light <HI>shining in darknesse,</HI> therewithall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pet.</NOTE> joyning to the Lords prayer, <HI>Open my eyes, that I may see the wonders of thy law.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, we must remember, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">A simili|tude and co~formitie with God.</NOTE> wee cannot see God without some si|militude and conformitie with him. Therefore saith Christ. <HI>Blessed are the poore in spirit for they shall see God.</HI> A|mong all the members of the body none can see the Sunne but the eye, because of some similitude that is be|tweene them. For as God hath set <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the great world, the Sunne and Moone in the sirmament, as instruments of light to serue it: so hath hee placed <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the little world (which is Man) two eyes in the highest part of his body, as or|ganes of light to serue him. But the eye being any way troubled or offended, as we see by experience, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">bhorres the light, wherein it otherwise delights: and after the same manner, the minde of man polluted with sinne, neyther can, nor dare looke vp to the Lord. <HI>Oculus</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="75">
<HI>cordis parturbatus, auertit se &agrave; luce iu|stitiae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">August. serm. 18.</NOTE> <HI>nec audet eam contemplari.</HI> The eye of the heart being perturbed (saith <HI>Augustine</HI>) turneth it selfe away from the light of righteousnesse, and dares not behold it. And to the same effect he sayes in another place, <HI>Male viuen</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">August. serm. 10.</NOTE> <HI>do videri &agrave; Deo non potes, videre Deum not potes, bene autem viuendo, &amp; videris, &amp; vides.</HI> If thou liue an euill life, thou shalt be seene of God, but shall not see him: but if thou liue a good life, thou art not onely seene of him, but thou maist also see him. So necessary is this conformitie with God by sanctificati on, that without it we cannot see God</P>
<P>Thirdly, to the sight of God, there<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Attention and consi|deration.</NOTE> is requisite attention and considerati|on, a meeke and quiet spirit, a heart stablished by grace, separate from o|ther things, and fixed on the Lord, <HI>Oculus circu~mact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s non videt etiam, quae ante se sunt:</HI> A watering and reeling eye, sees not those things which are be|fore it; and an vnstable minde, tossed too and fro with restlesse cares and
<PB N="144" REF="76">
perturbations is not meete to see the the Lord. When the Lord appeared to <HI>Eliah,</HI> there went before him a migh|ty winde, an earth-quake, and fire: but God was not in any one of them; hee followed in a soft, and still voyce, to teach vs, that we must haue meeke, set|led, and pacified spirits, if we looke that God should bee familiar with vs: and wee must set the eyes of our soules sta|ble and sixt on the Lord; attending on his shining mercies, like the eyes of seruants on their maisters, and while the Lord hath mercy vpon vs. These are the principall helpes, whereby the sight of God is begun in earth, which will be perfected in heauen.</P>

<P><PB N="145" REF="76">THe other thing wherein <HI>Iacob</HI> vt|tereth his thankfulnes, is in the o|bedience he giues to the Lords calling, walking on in the journey, which God commanded him.

<P>But it is to be marked, <HI>Moses</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iacob his wound makes him not giue ouer the journey.</NOTE> he halted as he went on in his journey. This is the meruailous working of the Lord no doubt, that <HI>Iacob</HI> being hurt in the night, &amp; his thigh-bone disjoyn|ted; yet walkes vpon it in the morne, and the hurt, which he receiued of the Lord, hinders him not, nor stayes him
<PB N="146" REF="77">
from going forward in the journey, which was enjoyned him by the Lord. We haue shewed you before, how the children of God in their wrestlings do in such sort preuaile, that they get no victory without a wound; who is able to say, that hee hath in such sort fought against Sathan and sin, but oftentimes hee hath beene buffeted by Sathan, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">And the wounds which the Godly re|ceiue in the spiritu|all combat make them stronger, and more circu~spect.</NOTE> wounded by sinne. Yet such is the gra|tious dispensation of the Lord, that as <HI>Iacobs</HI> hurt made him not giue ouer the journey, but rather confirmes him to go forward with greater boldnesse, now halting on one thigh, then before when hee went straight vpon both: so the Lord doth so dispence the spiritu|all battailes of his Children, that out of their manifold falles, buffets, and wounds, which they receiue in this war|fare, hee workes in them a greater ha|tred of sinne, and loue of righteousnes; a greater attention and circumspection in all their wayes, and a greater feruen|cy and zeale to run out the race which is set before them, and to renue the
<PB N="147" REF="77" MS="y">
battaile against Sathan and sinne.</P>
<P>And this wee may see cleerely in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Example hereo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in Dauid &amp; Peter.</NOTE> <HI>Dauid,</HI> who after his adultry &amp; mur|ther, being renued by repentance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">iseth againe with a greater hatred of sinne, and more earnest desire of mercy, than euer he had before. And did not <HI>Peters</HI> fall bring forth in like manner the like fruits in him, that hee sheddeth teares now more aboundantly, then at any time before? hee now stands boldly to confesse the Lord Iesus before the Counsell, whom before he had denied before a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">msell; and in all the rest of his life he shewes himselfe an example of godly zeale, labouring to confirme his brethren by a good conuersation, whom before hee had offended by his stumbling and falling. Thus the Lord by some one sinne, wherein hee susse|reth his children to haue experience of their weakenesse, wakeneth them to a narrower inquisition of their sins; for a light paine in the head men runne not to the Phisitian, nor to the water for a light spot in their garments: but if the
<PB N="148" REF="78">
defiling be great, then we doe take oc|casion thereat to wash away euen the smallest spot that is in them. So the godly, when oftentimes they passe ouer small sinnes without remorse, the Lord<NOTE PLACE="marg">This com|meth not of any goodnes in vs, but of the Lord his maruellous dispensati|on.</NOTE> permits them to fall into greater, that so they may be moued to mourning, &amp; hasten to an earnest reformation of all.</P>
<P>Where wee are not to thinke that this commeth of any goodnesse that is in vs, or in sin which we haue brought forth, but of the excellent wisdome and goodnesse of God: <HI>Deus etiam sum|mus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. ad Boniface. lib. 3. cap. 7.</NOTE> <HI>est medicus, qui ben&egrave; nouit vti enim malis,</HI> For God is that great Phisitian, who can vse to good euen those things which are euill.

Thus the Lord our God maketh all things serue and worke for the best to them that loue him: so as euen the wounds which we receiue in spiritual wrestlings

may well worke in vs a greater humi|liation but shall not confound vs, so that we leaue off the race and course to our heauenly Canaan.

<P>There are two things onely which trouble vs in this life. The first, is the remanents of sinne in our corrupt na|ture: this was such a matter of griefe, to the holy Apostle, that it made him<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7. 24</NOTE> to crie ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">; <HI>O miserable man that I am, who shall deliuer me from this body of death?</HI> So displeasant was it to him to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ue in that body, wherin hee found the motions of sin rebeling against the law of God.

<PB N="3" REF="81" MS="y">
it, from the beginning of this Chapter, to the middest of the 17. Verse. The other thing which may discourage vs, is the manifold troubles that follow vs in following Christ.</P>
<P>For the Church of God on earth, <HI>is as a Lilly among Thornes,</HI> and our<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 2. 2.</NOTE> Lord Iesus, <HI>as an Apple tree among the trees of the forrest:</HI> If wee delight to sit vnder his shadow; and if his fruit be sweet in our mouth, wee must be con|tent to walk toward him through ma|ny sharp afflictions: therefore are wee<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 3</NOTE> commaunded, not onely to suffer af|flictions as the good souldiers of Iesus Christ, but also to rejoyce in tribulati|ons: and if we cannot attaine to that perfection, at least to count it excee|ding<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 5. 3.</NOTE> joy, when we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">al into diuers temp|tations:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 1. 2.</NOTE> Yet because no chastisement is sweet for the present, it hath pleased<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1. 2.</NOTE> the Lord of his fatherly indulgence and pittie towards our weakenesse, to seison the cup of our bitter griefes, with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.</NOTE> his sweet comforts; which as hee doth in many other parts of holy Scripture,
<PB N="4" REF="82" MS="y">
so especially from the 17. verse of this Chapter, to the 30. wherein the Apo|stle abounds with consolation; shew|ing himselfe a faithfull Steward in the house of God, most carefull to lead as it were, by the hand, the weary sons and daughters of the liuing God, into the wineceller; there to refresh and stay vs with the <HI>Flagons of his wine,</HI> &amp; to com|fort<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 2. 4.

<P>That this is the Apostles purpose, and order of proceeding in this Chap|ter, I thinke his conclusion makes it manifest, which you haue from the 31. verse to the end; vvherein hee drawes all that he had said, into a short summe, containing the glorious triumph of a Christian ouer all his enimies: the
<PB N="5" REF="82" MS="y">
triumph is first set downe generally in the 31 Verse, <HI>What shall wee say then to these things: If God be with vs, who can be against vs?</HI> thereafter he parts this generall in two: there is (would he say) but one of two that are against vs, ey|ther sinne or affliction: as to sinne, hee triumphs against it, Verse 33. and 34. <HI>Who will lay any thing to the charge of Gods Chosen? It is God that iustifieth, who shall condemne? It is Christ who is dead, or rather who is risen againe, who is also at the right hand of God, and makes request for vs.</HI> As to affliction, hee be|gins his triumph against it, Verse 35. <HI>Who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ?</HI> his answere mounts vp by a gra|dation: <HI>Will tribulation or anguish doe it?</HI> Yea, <HI>will death it selfe doe it?</HI> or that which is more; <HI>will Principalities and powers doe it.</HI> 10. <HI>In all these things wee more then Conquerours, through him that loued vs. Thankes</HI> therefore <HI>be vnto our</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor 2. 14</NOTE> <HI>God, who alwayes makes vs to triumph in our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI></P>

<P>THe same comfort haue vvee also against death, that now in Christ Iesus it is not a punishment of our sinnes, but a full accomplishment of the motificatian of sinne, both in soule and body; for by it, all the Conduits of sinne are stopped, the weapons of vnrighteousnesse broken: and though
<PB N="31" REF="95" MS="y">
our bodyes seeme to bee consumed, yet are they but sowne like graines of Wheate, into the field and husbandry of the Lord, which must dye before they be quickned; but in the day of har|uest, shall spring vp againe most glori|ous, and shall be restored by the same holy spirit, who now dwels in them: and as to our soules they are releeued our of this house of seruitude, and that they may depart and turne to him from whom they came: therefore haue I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death compared to the red sea, wherin the Egipti|tians were drowned, and the Is|raelits we~t through to Canaan.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> How the plots and imaginations of men worke for the best to the Christian.</HEAD>
<P>NOw in the last roome concerning, the imaginations of men against vs, wee shall haue cause to say of them in the end, as <HI>Ioseph</HI> said to his brethe|ren, <HI>You did it vnto mee for euill but the Lord turned it vnto good.</HI> The whole Historie of Gods Booke, is as a cloude of manifold witnesses, concurring alto|gether to confirme this truth: I con|tent my selfe therefore for all, to bring one. When <HI>Dauid</HI> was going forward in the battaile against <HI>Israel,</HI> with <HI>A|chish</HI> King of <HI>Gath,</HI> vnder whom hee soiourned for a while, in the time of his banishment) the remnant Princes of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> commanded him to goe backe; and this they did for the worse to disgrace him, because they distrusted him: but the Lord turned it to him <HI>for the best:</HI> Consider <HI>Dauids</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="97" MS="y">
estate now, and ye shall see him set be|twixt too great extreamities. If he had gone backe of his owne accord, the <HI>Philistines</HI> might haue blamed him &amp; handled him as an enimie: if hee had come forward, hee should haue beene guiltie of the bloud of <HI>Israell,</HI> and espe|cially of <HI>Saul</HI> the Lords annointed; who was slaine in that battaile.</P>
<P>In this strait the wit of man can find him no out-gate, but the prouident mer|cy of God deliuers him in such sort, that no occasion of offence is giuen to <HI>Saul</HI> and his people, because <HI>Dauid</HI> came not against them: neither yet could the Philistines condemne him, because hee went back by their commaund. So no|table a benefit did <HI>Dauid</HI> receiue euen by that same deede, wherein his eni|mies thought they had done him a no|table shame: and it should learne vs in our straitest extreamities whereunto men can driue vs, to depend on the Lord, and euer then to hope for an out|gate, when we see none. For such is thy prouidence O Lord, whereby in mercy
<PB N="35" REF="97" MS="y">
thou watchest ouer those euils that are intended against them, that by thee they are turned into good to them.</P>
<P>And here we haue further to consi|der,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If this comfort belong to euery member, much more to the whole body and state of the Church.</NOTE> that seeing this is the priuiledge of euery one that loues the Lord; much more must it appertaine to the whole Church of God.

This is the heritage of the
<PB N="36" REF="98" MS="y">
Lords seruants, &amp; the portion of them who loue him. For the Church is the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 7. 18.</NOTE> Arke of God, which may mount vp higher as the waters increaseth, but cannot bee ouerwhelmed: the bush which may burne but cannot be con|sumed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 3. 2.</NOTE> the house built on a rock which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 7. 15.</NOTE> may bee beaten with the winde and raine, but cannot be ouerthrowne.</P>
<P>The Lord who changeth times and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enimies of Gods church looke to their ende.</NOTE> seasons, who takes away Kings and sets vp Kings, hath reproued Kings for his Churches sake: and he gouerneth all the kingdomes of the earth in such sort that their risings &amp; fallings, their chan|ges and mutations are all dispensed for the good of his Church: for there is but one of two sentences, wherein all the Iudges of the world may iudge of themselues, &amp; see cleerly their end. Ei|ther<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ester. 4. 14</NOTE> that which <HI>Mordecai</HI> said to <HI>Ester, who knowes if for this thou art come to the Kingdome, that by thee deliuerance might come to Gods people?</HI> Or else that which <HI>Moses</HI> in Gods name sayd to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> (the first oppressor of Gods
<PB N="37" REF="98" MS="y">
Church in his adolescency) <HI>I haue set thee vp to declare my power, because thou exaltest thy selfe against my people.</HI> How miserable then are they who when they are highest abuseth their power, to hold the people of God lowest.</P>
<P>Haue they not cause to feare least the Lord haue set them vp against him, as an object of his power and Iustice? if we will marke the course of the Lords proceeding euer since the beginning of the world, we shall finde that as he or|ders the state of earthly power, for the accomplishment of his wil, concerning his Church; so euermore a blessing fol|lowes them, who are instruments of her good: and by the contrary, an ineuita|ble curse followes them who are the in|struments of her euill.</P>
<P>When the Lord concluded to bring his Church from Canaan, to sojourne in <HI>Aegipt,</HI> he sent such a famine in Ca|naan, as compelled them to forsake it: but made plenty in <HI>Aegipt</HI> by the hand of <HI>Ioseph,</HI> whom the Lord sent before as a prouider for his Church? and by

It is that supreame cause of all, which orders all inferiour causes and incidents whatsoeuer, in such sort, that they must worke to the aduancement of that most high purpose of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our calling comes fro~ Gods pur|pose, and carries vs to the de|termined glory.</NOTE></P>
<P>This reason is made clearer in the subsequent Verse, where the Apostle lets vs see how the links of the golden Chaine of our Saluation are knit toge|ther inseperably by the hand of God, that no power in heauen or earth can sunder them: whereof it comes, that he that is sure of one, is sure of all. And
<PB N="54" REF="107" MS="y">
now let vs take a short view of it, for confirming of the Apostles Reason. <HI>Election</HI> is the first, and it is the most auncient Charter of the right of Gods Children, to their Fathers inheritance. <HI>Calling</HI> is the second, and it is that gift of God, whereby wee are knowne the sonnes of God, and our <HI>Election</HI> secret in it selfe, is made manifest to our selues and others. <HI>Iustification</HI> is the third, and it is the grace of God, whereby we are infeoft in Iesus Christ, in such sort, that wee are made one with him, and per|takers of all that is his. <HI>Glorification</HI> is the last, and it is that grace of GOD, whereby vvee shall bee entred in the due time, full Heyres to our heauenly Father.</P>
<P>No King on earth can produce so auncient a right to his crowne, as the Christian, effectually called. No man on earth can bee knowne his fathers heire vpon such sufficient warrant, as the Christian: for in his <HI>Regeneration,</HI> the Father communicates to him his Image, his Nature, and his Spirit,
<PB N="55" REF="107" MS="y">
whereby he begins from feeling to call God his father: and in life and manners resembleth him. No Free-holder so surely infeoft in his Lands, hauing so many confirmations of his right as hath the justified Christian, who vpon his guift, hath receiued the earnest, the Pledge, the Seale, and the Witnesse of the great King: and last of all, the Christian shall be entred to the ful fru|ition of his inheritance, with such joy and triumph in the glorious assembly of the Saints, as the like was neuer seene in the world, no not in Ierusalem that day when <HI>Salomon</HI> sate downe in<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kin 1. 14</NOTE> his fathers Throne; then their joy was so great, <HI>That the earth rang with the sound of them,</HI> but nothing comparable to this. And herein stands the excellen|cy of a Christian, and certaintie of his saluation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> How the Christian is made sure of his E|lection and Glorification.</HEAD>
<P>FOr this Chaine of our Saluation, reacheth (as I may say) from eterni|tie to eternitie: the beginning of it (al|beit before beginning) is our Election: the end of it (albeit without end) is our glorification: and these two ends of the Chaine, the Lord keepes them sure &amp; secret in his owne hand: but the two middle links of the Chaine, to wit <HI>Cal|ling</HI> and <HI>Iustification,</HI> the Lord hath let|ten them downe from the Heauen to earth, that we should gripe and appre|hend them: that being sure of the two middle Links, wee might also bee sure of the two ends; because the Lord hath knit them inseparably together. Then thou, who wouldest be comforted with the assurance of thy Saluation, take heed of this, making it knowne to thine owne Conscience by a holy life, that
<PB N="57" REF="108" MS="y">
God hath called thee, and iustified thee: Gripe sure, as it were with one hand, the linke of <HI>Calling,</HI> and with the other hand, the linke of <HI>Iustification;</HI> then maist thou know assuredly, Election before the world is thine; <HI>Glorification</HI> after this, shall also be thine. To make this yet more plaine, we are to remem|ber, this mortall life of ours, is a short interiected point of Time, betwixt two Eternities (if so I may call it:) or like a stepping stone, betwixt two Gulphes, whereupon some in feare and tremb|ling worke out their Saluation; and so steps from Gods eternall Election to endlesse glorification.</P>
<P>Others againe, in wantonnesse and carelesse securitie drinkes in iniquitie with greedinesse, and so steps from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">By your disposition in this life, each man hath to consider of his euer|lasting weale or woe.</NOTE> decree of Reprobation, that most iust|ly they procure their euerlasting con|demnation: So that euery man is to consider of his euerlasting weale or woe, by his present disposition in this life. Oh that wee had sanctified memo|ries to remember this so long as wee
<PB N="58" REF="109" MS="y">
are here. If of weaknesse wee fall, wee may rise againe: and if wee haue not learned well to repent in one day, wee haue leaue of the Lords patience to learne it better another day, his name bee praysed therefore, who hath open|ed a doore of mercie to sinners, and with long suffering waits for our re|pentance. But he who in the day of his transmigration steps the wrong step, will neuer get leaue to amend it. Where the tree falles, it shal lie there; the wic|ked dies in their sinnes, and so steps downeward to the deep pit and gulph, out of which there is no redemption. Let vs therefore be wel aduised before wee leape. Let vs fasten our feete in the borders of that <HI>Canaan</HI> in time, which shalbe done, if wee make our whole life a proceeding from <HI>Election</HI> to <HI>Glo|rification,</HI> and that through <HI>Calling</HI> and <HI>Iustification;</HI> which two, hath insepara|bly following them, the Sanctification and Renouation of the whole man.</P>
<P>The Lord make vs wise in time, that we may consider our course, and think

<P>But now to returne to the words of this discription of the persons to whom this priuiledge appertaineth, wee haue these things. First, the <HI>Purpose of God:</HI> Secondly, his Calling <HI>according to his purpose:</HI> Thirdly, <HI>the euident token</HI> ac|cording to Gods calling, which is <HI>the loue of God.</HI> The <HI>purpose of God,</HI> concer|ning thy saluation, thou maist know by thy calling: and if againe thou wilt <HI>try thy calling,</HI> try it by <HI>the loue of God,</HI> which thou finds in thee.

<P><HI>ACcording to his purpose.</HI> Here you see then how the Apostle draw|eth our <HI>Calling</HI> from the <HI>purpose of God:</HI> and so when hee will comfort vs vvith the certaintie of our saluation, he leads vs out of our selues, vp to the Rocke that is higher then wee, hee teacheth vs to cast our Anchor within the vaile, and to fasten our soules vpon that vn|changeable <HI>Purpose of God.</HI> It is most expedient for the Children of God, to mark this, because the manifold chan|ges wee finde in our selues, doe often|times interrupt the peace of our minds, that the Lord our God hath in such sort dispensed our Saluation, that the ground thereof is laide in his owne immutable <HI>Purpose,</HI> but the markes, to|kens and pledges hee placeth in them,
<PB N="61" REF="110" MS="y">
after their <HI>Calling,</HI> for whom it was or|dayned. The tokens are changeable, as we our selues in whom they are are changeable: but the ground holds fast, being laid in the vnchangeable God, in whom can be no shadow of alterati|on: and this should comfort vs against our daily vicissitudes, changes, defects, and temporall desertion; our faith may faint, our spirituall life may languish, our hope hoouer, our harts in praying fall downe like the infeebled hands of <HI>Moses,</HI> yet let vs not despaire, no change in vs can alter the Lords vnchangeable <HI>Purpose,</HI> he vvho hath begun the work in vs, will also perfect it. <HI>Because I am</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mal. 3. 6.</NOTE> <HI>not changed</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>therefore is it that yee, O Sonnes of Iacob, are not consumed.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our salua|tion is ney|ther in part nor in the whole, as|cribed to our merits.</NOTE></P>
<P>This <HI>purpose of God</HI> is called other|waies, <HI>The will of God,</HI> and <HI>the good pleasure of his will:</HI> and it doth learne vs, to giue to the Lord the praise which is due to him, namely the praise of the whole worke of our saluation, should bee ascribed to the good pleasure of <HI>his</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="111" MS="y">
<HI>will</HI> onely, and not to our foreseene me|rits: that poyson of pride, which Sa|than powred in our first parents, wher|by hee prouoked them to aspire, to be equall with God, doth yet appeare in their posteritie, the corrupt heart of man euer ayming at this, eyther in part or in whole, to haue the praise of salua|tion ascribed to himselfe, and so would start vp in the roome of God, vsurping that glory which belongeth to the Lord, and hee will not giue to another: then the which no Sacriledge more fearefull can be committed against the Lord. O man! content thee vvith that which the Lord offers thee, and let that alone, vvhich the Lord reserueth to himselfe, <HI>My peace</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>I giue vnto you, but my glory I will not giue to another.</HI> It is enough, that the saluation of the Lord is thine, but as for the glory of saluation, let it re|maine to the Lord, hee is for this cal|led <HI>the Father of Mercy,</HI> because mer|cy is bred in his owne bosome: ma|ny causes without himselfe found hee

<P><HI>TO them that are called. The purpose of God,</HI> which is sufficient in it selfe, is made knowne and manifest to vs by <HI>his Calling:</HI> for our <HI>Calling</HI> is a declaration of the decree of our <HI>Electi|on,</HI> and as it were the secret voice of God, bringing from the Heauens to our soules, this comfortable message, <HI>That wee are the sonnes of God.</HI> Now wee must know that Gods <HI>Calling</HI> is twofold: one outward, which is com|mon also to the wicked, &amp; of it speakes our Sauiour, <HI>Many are called, but f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">w are chosen:</HI> The other inward and effe|ctuall, proper only to the godly, whom the Lord is purposed to saue.

Yee that will take a right view of all mankinde, shall finde<NOTE PLACE="marg">All the world stands in three Cir|cles, &amp; that none are happy, ex|cept they who are within the third.</NOTE> them as it were standing in the three circles; they onely being happie who are within the third. In the outmost Circle are all those on whom the Lord hath not vouchsafed so much as an outward calling; and here stands the greatest part of the world. In the mid|dlemost Circle, which is much narrow|er, are all those which are partakers of Gods outward calling by the word &amp; Sacraments, And in the third circle, which is of smallest compasse in re|gard of the rest, stands those who be|side the outward calling of God by his word, are called also inwardly and effectually by his holy Spirit. These are Christs little flocke, the fewe cho|sen, the communion of saints, the Lords <HI>third part,</HI> so to speake with <HI>Zacharic;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. 13. 9</NOTE> the two parts shall be cut off and die, but <HI>The third will the Lord sine as siluer and gold:</HI> of them will the Lord say, <HI>This is my people, and they shall say, The Lord is my God,</HI> It is a great steppe in|deede,
<PB N="66" REF="113" MS="y">
that we are brought from the vttermost Circle vnto the second, but it is not sufficient to saluation, yea ra|ther they who stand in the second Cir|cle, hearing the voice of God call them to repentance, and yet harden their hearts, and will not follow the Lord, may looke for a more fearefull con|demnation, than they who are in the vtmost ranke of all.

Content not your selues therefore with this, that you are brought within the compasse of this visible Church, and made partakers of an outward <HI>Cal|ling,</HI> that ye haue bene baptized in the name of Iesus, and communicated at his holy table; for not euerie one that sayes <HI>Lord, Lord shall enter into his kingdom,</HI> except ye find also the Lords

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the inward Calling.</HEAD>
<P>THen wee see this excellent pri|uiledge is restrained to them who are called inwardly, and therefore let vs yet a little consider it. This inward Calling is the Communication of Christs sauing grace, vvhereby the minde is inlightened, the heart purified by faith, the affections sanctified, and the whole man reformed. For as the Lord by his Gospell offers to his chil|dren righteousnesse and life, so by his holy spirit he giues them that iustify|ing Faith, and openeth their hearts to
<PB N="68" REF="114" MS="y">
receiue that Grace which is preached and proclaimed to them in the Gospel, So then this worke of our Calling, is altogether the Lords: It is his praise<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4.</NOTE> that hee cals things which are not, and makes them to be: the Lord that com|maunded light to shine out of dark|nesse, hath giuen to our mindes the light of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Christ Iesus: hee it is that creates in vs a new heart, and putteth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 41.</NOTE> a new spirit into our bowels, that vvee may walke in his statutes. The Lord promised that hee would call many of the Gentiles to the spiritual Ierusalem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ez. 11. 19.</NOTE> to suck out the milke of the breasts of her consolation, and be delighted with the brightnesse of his glory: shall I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 66.</NOTE> cause others to bee fruitfull (saith the Lord) and remaine barren my selfe? and this his gracious promise hath he most abundantly performed in our dayes; his name be praised therefore.</P>
<P>As this worke is onely the Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This in|ward cal|ling is the arme of God, choosing out in the world his own elect.</NOTE> so he restraines it onely to them who are his owne. The outward Calling is
<PB N="69" REF="114" MS="y">
extended to all; but the inward calling makes a particular seperation of a few from the remnant: where it is wonder|full to see the distinction which is made betwixt man and man in all rankes and estates, by this effectuall calling of two Brethren, as <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Esau:</HI> of two Prophets, as <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Balaam:</HI> of two Kings, as <HI>Dauid</HI> and <HI>Saul:</HI> of two Apostles, as <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iudas:</HI> of two theeues, the one is taken, the other reiected, and thus the arme of the grace of God, goes through to euerie corner of the earth, according to his pleasure, culling out by his word, from among the remnant of the world, those who belong to his Election.</P>
<P>This grace of God, it enters in a Land, and not into euery Cittie: it en|ters into a Cittie, but not into euery Fa|milie: yea it will enter into a Familie, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">et not come to euery person of the Familie, or husband and wife, of Maisters and Seruants, of Parents and Children, of Brethren and Sisters, of|tentimes the one is taken, the other is
<PB N="70" REF="115" MS="y">
left: It came to <HI>Iericho,</HI> and chose out<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whereof it comes that the Gospell where it is preached makes a great diffe|rence be|twixt man and man.</NOTE> <HI>Zacheus.</HI> It came to <HI>Philipi,</HI> and weiled out <HI>Lidia</HI> and the <HI>Iaylor:</HI> It came to <HI>Nero</HI> his court, and not to himselfe; It entred into the familie of <HI>Narcissus,</HI> and yet past by <HI>Narcissus</HI> himselfe; It is the worke of God, and merueilous in our eies. The Gospell is preached to many, but the blessing brought by the Gospell, lights onely vpon the children of grace: And hereof ariseth this day|ly distinction, which we see betweene man and man, all heare alike, but all haue not Faith, all are not edified alike: Some forsake their sins, and followes the Lord, others forsaking the Lord, walkes on in their sinnes. As the Lord gouerneth the raine, and makes it fall vpon one Cittie, and not vpon another: so hee dispenseth the dew of his grace, that hee makes it droppe downe vpon one heart, and not vpon another. And of this I would wish that so many of you as yet are strangers from Grace, should learne to know your miserable state: What a fearefull thing is this,
<PB N="71" REF="115" MS="y">
that God hath conuerted so many in<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the hart wher|on grace descends not now in this time of grace is accursed.</NOTE> the Cittie wherein thou dwellest, yea perhaps many in the familie wherein thou remainest, and yet his grace ne|uer lighted vpon thee, but thou art left in thy olde sinnes?

If the Lord should do to you as hee did to <HI>Israel,</HI> in the daies of <HI>Achab,</HI> causing it to raine for three yeares &amp; a halfe on all the lands about you, but not vpon your Land, would you not conceiue in it a sensible curse of God vpon you? O Hypocrite, thou that canst discerne the face of the skie, and take vp the tokens of Gods anger in the creature, canst thou not discerne the state of thine owne soule, nor ap|prehend this for a sensible curse, that thirty or forty yeares, the showers of sauing and renewing grace, hath de|scended vpon the people round about thee, but neuer vpon thy selfe? thou possessest thy old sins and keepest still a hard, a barren, and a fruitlesse heart. What shall I say to thee? to cut thee off from all hope of mercie, and so
<PB N="72" REF="116" MS="y">
send thee to despaire; I haue not that in commission: the Lord hath his owne time of calling, and can when he will, of <HI>Saul</HI> a persecutor, make <HI>Paul</HI> a Preacher.

<PB N="73" REF="116" MS="y">
the Lord began at the light; so in the second Creation he begins at the il|lumination of the minde: For wee can neither know the Lord to feare and loue him, neyther yet our selues and our sinnes aright, till the Lord vvho commanded light to shine out of dark|nesse, shine also into our hearts to giue vs the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD in the face of Iesus Christ: and this light of God, disco|uers to vs so many workes of darknes, wherewith in ignorance wee defiled our Consciences, that wee begin to be ashamed of our selues, in the sight of God; yea, our very flesh trembleth for feare of his iudgements, and vvee crie out with <HI>Iob, Now my eye hath</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 42.</NOTE> <HI>seene the Lord, therefore I abhorre my selfe.</HI> And thus the Lord proceeds from the minde to the heart, working into<NOTE PLACE="marg">He work|eth moti|ons of sor|row and contrition in the hart.</NOTE> it such a contrition and godly sorrow, as causeth repentance vnto saluation, whereby the heart that was senselesse before, being dead in sinne and tres|passes, begins now to stir and moue&punc; as

<HI>Iosiahs</HI> heart melted at the reading of the Law: and the hearts of those pe|nitent Iewes, which were pricked at the sharpe Sermon of <HI>Peter,</HI> then feeling our selues vnder death through sinne, wee begin to thinke vs of the wayes of life, and to aske with the <HI>Iaylor, What</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 24. 25</NOTE> <HI>shall wee doe that wee may bee saued?</HI> These motions, meltings and prickings of the hart, wrought in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lect by the operation of Gods word, are the very plucks of the hand of God, translating thee out of Nature into Grace: yet must wee not rest here, for <HI>Felix</HI> may tremble while <HI>Paul</HI> is preaching, and many for a while may receiue this word with joy, and yet afterward fall away in the time of temptation. Wee must<NOTE PLACE="marg">He work|eth a re|spondence and answe ring of the hart to his calling and a follow|ing of the Lord.</NOTE> therefore consider, if there bee in the hart a respondence and answering vn|to the Lord, so oft as hee calleth, doe wee present our selues before him, rea|dy to follow him saying with <HI>Abraham here I am Lord,</HI> and with <HI>Samuel</HI> (after hee knew the Lords voyce) <HI>Speake on Lord, thy Seruant heareth thee.</HI> This
<PB N="75" REF="117" MS="y">
answering and following of the Lord, are vndoubted tokens of effectuall <HI>Calling.</HI> So oft as the Lord calleth, the Christian answereth: When thou saidst <HI>Seeke yee my face,</HI> my heart answered<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 27.</NOTE> <HI>O Lord I will seeke thy face.</HI> If the Lord commaund the Christian answereth, <HI>O Lord, quicken me according to thy lo|uing</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 119. 18</NOTE> <HI>kindnesse, that I may apply my heart to keepe thy statutes alwayes to the end.</HI> If the Lord promise mercy, the Chri|stian answeres, <HI>Stablish O Lord thy pro|mise</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 119. 39</NOTE> <HI>to thy Seruant, and let it bee to me according to thy word, for I beleeue in thee, but Lord help my vnbeleefe.</HI> And thus in the heart of one effectually cal|led, there is a continual respondence to the voyce of God, a waiting on the Lord, a walking with him, and a fol|lowing of him where euer hee goe. If the Lord haue called thee, sure it is thou wilt follow him, and no power of the Diuell, of the world, or of the slesh shall hold thee back from him.

<P>And herein he stands vp to witnesse vnto vs, that vnlesse wee haue a most feruent desire to participate of this ho|ly Sacrament, which the Lord hath in|stituted to seale vp and increase our spirituall Communion with him; wee

<P>THe Apostle saith, that the break|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 16</NOTE> of this bread is the Commu|nion of the body of Iesus; Sith Christ is that holy thing which here is com|municated, take heede how wee make ready the heart, wherin to receiue him. <HI>Ioseph</HI> of Aramathia, and the rest of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 19. 40</NOTE> those Godly ones, who tooke downe Iesus from the Crosse, wrapped his dead bodie in pure and fine linnen; what shall wee then doe, with the li|uing body of Iesus? shall not wee re|ceiue it into pure, sine, and well prepa|red hearts?

<P>And now because this tryall of our selues is so necessary, let vs here re|member that there are two things with|out which wee cannot profite in this work of tryall.

<P>The other thing whereby we are to proceede in this tryall, is the word of God; for euery thing that is imperfect, must be tryed by another not by it self: gold is tryed by the fire &amp; touch stone, the weight of a thing is tryed by the ballance, and the spots of the face are tryed by the glasse.

<P>And lastly, let vs take heede that the Apostle commaundeth vs to trie our selues, and not to trie other men.

<P>I graunt indeed it is a poynt of Chri|stian duty to admonish our brethren of their sinnes, if it bee done in Loue: for so vvee are commaunded, <HI>Thou shalt</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leu 19. 17</NOTE> <HI>not hate thy brother in thy hart, but shalt reproue him.</HI> It is hatred and not Loue,

<ITEM>OF the seruent desire Christians haue to be vnited with Christ. How in|excusable they are who neglect this ho|ly sacrament. The great danger in com|ming vnprepared. The parts of the pre|cept: first, that we try: secondly, that we eate: the last handled first. Chap. 1</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ignorance the mother of all recusancie to communicate. The Reasons of diuers Resusals condemned. Better Excuses

<ITEM>Three Rules to be obserued in the right descerning the Lords body. First, that euery thing in this Sacrament bee ta|ken in his owne kind. Who failes in this and how. Secondly, that this Sacra|ment be vsed according to Christs in|stitution. How the Papists faile in this. Thirdly, that this Sacrament be vsed to right ends, and those ends set down. The conclusion of the first part of the precept. Chap. 3</ITEM>
<ITEM>The second part of the precept commands tryall before we Communicate. The Lord will not that this Table bee a snare to vs, as was Absalom to Am|mon. Banquetters at this Table should be holy persons. Chap. 4</ITEM>
<ITEM>Unreuerent handling of holy things hath neuer beene left vnpunished. The Lord will not shew his presence without pre|paration. The excellencie of this Sa|crament, and an exhortation to come

<ITEM>What a laborious work is enioyned a man when hee is commaunded to try him|selfe. Two things necessary for this try|all: First, the Spirit of God: Secondly, the Word of God. Many try them|selues by wrong Rules, and are so de|ceiued. Chap 7</ITEM>
<ITEM>The points of preparation are two: First, that wee lay aside our old sinnes: Se|condly, that we put on the new Chri|stian disposition, consisting in three things. First, that towards God we be holy and heauenly minded. Secondly, that towards our neighbours wee bee louing: Thirdly, that wee be sober and little in our owne eies. The comforta|ble fruit arising to vs at this holie Table. Chap. 8</ITEM>
