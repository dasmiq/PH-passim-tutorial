<HEAD>TO THE MEMORY OF HIS DEARE BROTHER M^r THO. RANDOLPH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN such a solemne traine of freinds that sing</L>
<L>Thy Dirge in pious lines, and sadly bring</L>
<L>Religious Anthemes to attend thy Hearse,</L>
<L>Striving t'embalme thy precious name in verse:</L>
<L>I, that should most, have no more power to raise</L>
<L>Trophies to thee, or bring one graine of praise</L>
<L>To crowne thy Altar, then the Orbes dispence</L>
<L>Motion without their sole Intelligence.</L>
<L>For I confesse that power which workes in mee</L>
<L>Is but a weake resultance tooke from thee;</L>
<L>And if some scatter'd seeds of heate divine</L>
<L>Flame in my brest, they are deriv'd from thine:</L>
<L>And these low sickly numbers must be such,</L>
<L>As when steel moves, the Loadstone gives the touch.</L>
<L>So like a spungy cloud that sucks up raine</L>
<L>From the fat soile to send it back againe;</L>
<L>There may be now from me some language showne</L>
<L>To urge thy merit, but 'twas first thy owne:</L>
<L>For though the Doners influence be past</L>
<L>For new effects, the old impressions last;</L>
<L>As in a bleeding trunk we oft descry</L>
<L>Leaps in the head, and rowlings in the eye,</L>
<L>By vertue of some spirits, that alone</L>
<L>Doe tune those Organs though the soule be gone.</L>

<PB REF="5">But since I adde unto this generall noise</L>
<L>Only weake sounds, and Echoes of thy voice;</L>
<L>Be this a taske for deeper mouthes, while I</L>
<L>That cannot bribe the Phansy, thaw the eye:</L>
<L>And on that Grave where they advance thy praise</L>
<L>Doe plant a sprigge of Cypresse not of Bayes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet flow these teares &punc;not that thy Reliques sit</L>
<L>Fix'd to their cell a constant Anchorit:</L>
<L>Nor am I stirr'd that thy pale ashes have</L>
<L>O're the darke Climate of a private Grave</L>
<L>No faire inscription: such distempers flow</L>
<L>From poore lay-thoughts, whose blindnesse cannot&punc; know</L>
<L>That to discerning Spirits the Grave can be</L>
<L>But a large wombe to Immortality:</L>
<L>And a faire vertuous name can stand alone</L>
<L>Brasse to the Tombe, and marble to the Stone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No, 'tis that Ghostly progeny we mourne,</L>
<L>Which carelesse you let fall into the Vrne:</L>
<L>We had not flow'd with such a lavish tide</L>
<L>Of teares and greife, had not those Orphans dy'd.</L>
<L>For what had been my losse, who reading thine,</L>
<L>A Brother might haue kiss'd in every line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These that are left, Posterity must have;</L>
<L>Whom a strict care hath rescu'd from the Grave</L>
<L>To gather strength by Vnion; as the beames</L>
<L>Of the bright Sunne shot forth in severall streames,</L>
<L>And thinly scatter'd with lesse fervour passe,</L>
<L>Which cause a flame contracted in a Glasse.</L>
<L>These, if they cannot much advance thy fame,</L>
<L>May stand dumbe Statues to preserve thy name:</L>
<L>And like Sun-dialls to a day that's gone,</L>
<L>Though poore in use, can tell there was a Sunne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet (if a faire confession plant no Bayes,</L>
<L>Nor modest truth conceiv'd a lavish praise)</L>
<L>I could to thy great glory tell this age</L>
<L>Not one invenom'd line doth swell the page</L>
<L><PB REF="5">With guilty legends; but so cleare from all</L>
<L>That shoot malicious noise, and vomit gall,</L>
<L>That 'tis observ'd in every leafe of thine,</L>
<L>Thou hast not scatter'd snakes in any line.</L>
<L>Here are no remnants tortur'd into rime</L>
<L>To gull the reeling judgments of the time;</L>
<L>Nor any stale reversions patch thy writ</L>
<L>Gleand from the ragges and frippery of wit.</L>
<L>Each syllable doth here as truly runne</L>
<L>Thine, as the light is proper to the Sunne.</L>
<L>Nay in those feebler lines which thy last breath</L>
<L>And labouring brains snatch'd from the skirts of death</L>
<L>Though not so strongly pure, we may descry</L>
<L>The father in his last posterity,</L>
<L>As clearly showne, as Virgins looks doe passe</L>
<L>Through a thinne lawne, or shaddowes in a glasse:</L>
<L>And in thy setting, as the Suns, confesse,</L>
<L>The same large brightnesse, though the heate be lesse.</L>
<L>Such native sweetnesse flowes in every line,</L>
<L>The Reader cannot choose but sweare 'tis thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though I can tell a rugged sect there is</L>
<L>Of some fly-wits will judge a squint on this;</L>
<L>And from thy easy flux of language guesse</L>
<L>The fancies weake, because the noise is lesse;</L>
<L>As if that Channell which doth smoothly glide</L>
<L>With even streames flow'd with a shallow tide.</L>
<L>But let a quick-discerning judgment looke,</L>
<L>And with a peircing eye untwist thy book</L>
<L>In every loome, I know the second veiw</L>
<L>Shall finde more lustre then the first could doe.</L>
<L>For have you seene when gazing on the skies</L>
<L>With strict survey a new succession rise</L>
<L>Of severall starres, which doe not so appeare</L>
<L>To every formall glance that shootes up there:</L>
<L>So when the serious eye has firmly been</L>
<L>Fix'd on the page, such large increase is seen</L>
<L><PB REF="6">Of various fancy, that each severall veiw</L>
<L>Makes the same fruitfull book a Mart of new.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But I forbeare this mention; since I must</L>
<L>Ransack thy ashes, and revile thy dust</L>
<L>With such low characters, I mean to raise</L>
<L>Thee to my contemplation, not my praise:</L>
<L>And they that wish thy Picture clearly showne</L>
<L>In a true Glasse, I wish would use thy owne:</L>
<L>Where I presume how e're thy vertues come</L>
<L>Ill shap'd abroad, th'art fairly drest at home.</L>

<L>AS when a swelling Cloud melted to showres,</L>
<L>Sweetly diffuses fresh and active powers</L>
<L>Into the shrunke and thirstie veines of earth;</L>
<L>Blessing her barren wombe with a new birth</L>

<L>Of merc'lesse Plague, Famine, or Dearth; and then</L>
<L>Collects it's streames unto the Ocean:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So thy diffusive soule, and fluent parts,</L>
<L>(Great miracle of naturall wit and Arts,)</L>
<L>Rapt up some Regions 'bove our Spheare, did flow</L>
<L>And showre their blessings downe on us below:</L>
<L>Whilst we, dull earth, in extasies did sit,</L>
<L>Almost o'rewhelmed with thy Flouds of Wit.</L>
<L>What bloud of verse is pump't from our dry Braines,</L>
<L>Sprung like a rushing Torrent from thy Veines.</L>
<L>When a long Drought presag'd some fatall Dearth,</L>
<L>Thy unexhausted Founts gave us new byrth</L>
<L>Of Wit and verse: when <HI>Cham,</HI> or <HI>Isis</HI> fell,</L>
<L>Thy open'd Floudgates made their Riv'lets swell</L>
<L>'Bove their proud Banks: Where planted by thy hand</L>
<L>Th' <HI>Hesperian</HI> Orchards, <HI>Paphian</HI> Myrtles stand,</L>
<L>And those sweet Shades, where Lovers tell their blisses</L>
<L>To th' whisp'ring leaves, and summe'em up in kisses.</L>
<L>There in full Quire the Muses us'd to sing</L>
<L>Melodious Odes, bathing in <HI>Cham,</HI> their Spring:</L>
<L>And all the Graces, TOM, dwelt with thee too,</L>
<L>Crowning thy Front for old <HI>Citherons</HI> Brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor were we rich alone; Climes farre from hence</L>
<L>Acknowledge yet thy soveraigne influence:</L>
<L><HI>Sicilians</HI> owe to thee their fruitfull <HI>Vale,</HI></L>

<L>To th' Muses Pipe, and Winter rhime to spring.</L>
<L>They pray for the first curse; like Schollers now,</L>
<L>To earne their livings by their sweaty Brow.</L>

<L>Thus, TOM thy pregnant Phancy crown'd us all</L>

<L>Nor did thy dews distill in a cold raine,</L>

<L>I'th' golden age no action could be found</L>

<L>What's Conscience but a Beldams midnight theme?</L>

<L>To watch their Orchards, and their Dairies.</L>

<L>Suppose it be a vertue rich, and pure,</L>
<L>'Tis not for Spring, or Summer sure,</L>
<L>Nor yet for Autumne; Love must have his prime,</L>

<L>All Loves are happy, none with us there bee,</L>
<L>Now sick of coynesse, or unconstancy.</L>
<L>The wealthy summes of Kisses doe amount</L>
<L>To greater scores then curious art can count!</L>
<L>Each eye is fix'd upon his Mistris face,</L>
<L>And every arme is lockt in some embrace.</L>
<L>Each cheeke is dimpled; every lip doth smile:</L>
<L>Such happinesse I wish this blessed Isle,</L>
<L>This little world of Lovers: and least you</L>
<L>Should think this blisse no reall joyes, nor true,</L>
<L>Would every Lady in this orbe might see</L>
<L>Their Loves as happy as we say they be!</L>
<L>And for you gentle youths, whose tender hearts</L>
<L>Are not shot proofe 'gainst love and <HI>Cupids</HI> darts;</L>
<L>These are my Prayrs, (I would those prayrs were charmes)</L>
<L>That each had here his Mistrisse in his armes.</L>
<L>True Lovers, (for tis truth gives love delight)</L>
<L>To you our Authors only means to wright.</L>
<L>If he have pleas'd (as yet he doubtfull stands)</L>
<L>For his applause clap lips instead of Hands.</L>
<L>He beggs nor Bayes, nor Ivy; only this,</L>
<L>Seale his wisht <HI>Plaudite</HI> with an amorous Kisse.</L>
