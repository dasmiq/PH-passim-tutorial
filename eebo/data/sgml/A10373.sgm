<HEAD>To the KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most gracious Soueraigne:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THose that are sup|prest and helpelesse are commonly silent, wishing that the common ill in al sort might be with their particular misfor|tunes: which dispo|sition, as it is vn|charitable in all men, so would it be in me more dogge-like then man-like, to bite the stone that strooke me: (to wit) the borrowed autho|ritie of my Soueragne misinformed, seeing their armes and hands that flang it, are most of them al|ready rotten. For I must confesse it euer, that they are debts, and not discontentments, that your Ma|iesty hath laid vpon me; the debts and obligation of a friendlesse aduersity, farre more payable in all Kinds, then those of the prosperous: All which, nor
<PB REF="3">
the least of them, though I cannot discharge, I may yet endeauour it.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding my restraint hath re|trenched all wayes, as well the wayes of labour and will, as of all other imployments, yet hath is left with me my cogitations, then which I haue nothing else to offer on the Altar of my Loue.</P>
<P>Of those (most gracious Soueraigne) I haue vsed some part in the following dispute, betweene a Coun|sellour of Estate, and a Iustice of Peace, the one dis|swading, the other perswading the calling of a Par|liament. In all which, since the Norman Conquest (at the least so many as Histories haue gathered) I haue in some things in the following Dialogue pre|sented your Maiestie with the contentions and suc|cesses.</P>
<P>Some things there are, and those of the greatest, which because they ought first to be resolued on, I thought fit to range them in the front of the rest, to the end your Maiestie may be pleased to examine your owne great and Princely heart of their accep|tance, or refusall.</P>
<P>The first is, that supposition, that your Maie|sties Subiects giue nothing but with adiunction of their own interests, interlacing in one and the same act your Maiesties reliefe, and their owne liberties; not that your Maiesties pietie was euer suspected, but because the best Princes are euer the least iea|lous, your Maiestie iudging others by your selfe, who haue abused your Maiesties trust. The fear'd continuance of the like abuse may perswade the pro|uision.
<PB REF="3" MS="y">
But this caution, how euer it seemeth at first sight, your Maiesty shall perceiue by many ex|amples following but friuolous. The bonds of Sub|iects to their Kings should alwayes be wrought out of Iron, the bonds of Kings vnto Subiects but with Cobwebs.</P>
<P>This it is (most renowned Soueraigne) that this trafficke of assurances hath beene often vrged, of which, if the Conditions had beene easie, our Kings haue as easily kept them; if hard and preiudiciall, either to their honours or estates, the Creditours haue beene paid their debts with their owne pre|sumption.</P>
<P>For all binding of a King by Law vpon the ad|uantage of his necessitie, makes the breach it selfe lawfull in a King. His Charters and all other in|struments being no other then the suruiuing witnes|ses of vnconstrained will: <HI>Princeps non subijcitur nisi sua voluntate libera, mero moto &amp; certa Scientia:</HI> Necessary words in all the grants of a King witnessing that the same grants were giuen freely and knowingly.</P>
<P>The second resolution will rest in your Maiesty leauing the new impositions, all Monopolies, and other grieuances of the people to the consideration of the House; Prouided, that your Maiesties reue|nue be not abated, which if your Maiesty shall refuse, it is thought that the disputes will last long, and the issues will be doubtfull: And on the contrary, if your Maiesty vouchsafe it, it may perchance be stiled a yeelding, which seemeth by the sound to braue the Regalty.</P>
<P><PB REF="4" MS="y">But (most excellent Prince) what other is it to th'eares of the wise, but as the sound of a trumpet, hauing blasted forth a false Alarme, becomes but common ayre? Shall the head yeeld to the feet? certainly it ought, when they are grieued; for wis|dome will rather regard the commodity, then obiect the disgrace, seeing if the <HI>feet</HI> lye in fetters, the <HI>head</HI> cannot be freed, and where the feet feele but their owne paines, the head doth not onely suffer by participation, but withall by consideration of the euill.</P>
<P>Certainly, the point of honour well weighed hath nothing in it to euen the ballance, for by your Ma|iesties fauour, your Maiesty doth not yeeld either to any person, or to any power, but to a dispute onely, in which the Proposition and Minor proue nothing without a conclusion, which no other person or power can make, but a Maiesty: yea, this in <HI>Henry</HI> the third his time was called a wisedome incomparable. For, the King raised againe, recouers his authority: For, being in that extremity as hee was driuen with the Queene and his Children, <HI>Cum Abbatibus &amp; Prioribus saris homilibus hospitia quaerere &amp; prandia</HI>: For the rest, may it please your Maiesty to consider that there can nothing befall your Ma|iesty in matters of affaires more vnfortunately then the summons of a Parliament, with ill successe: A dishonour so perswasiue and aduenturous as it will not onely finde arguments; but it will take the lea|ding of all enemies that shall offer themselues against your Maiesties estate.</P>
<P><PB REF="4" MS="y"><HI>Le labourin de la paurete ne saict poinct de breuct:</HI> of which dangerous disease in Princes, the remedy doth chiefly consist in the loue of the people, which how it may be had and held, no man knowes better then your Maiesty; how to loose it, all men know, and know that it is lost by nothing more then by the defence of others in wrong doing. The onely motiues of mischances that euer came to Kings of this Land since the Conquest.</P>
<P>It is onely <HI>loue</HI> (most renowned Soueraigne) must prepare the way for your Maiesties following desires. It is <HI>loue</HI> which obeyes, which suffers, which giues, which stickes at nothing: which Loue, as well of your Maiesties people, as the loue of God to your Maiesty, that it may alwayes hold shall be the con|tinuall prayers of your Maiesties most humble vassall,</P>

<HEAD>A DIALOGVE BE|TWEENE A COVN|SELLOVR OF STATE, AND A IVSTICE OF PEACE.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNSELLOVR.</SPEAKER>
<P>NOW Sir, what thinke you of M S&punc; <HI>Iohns</HI> tryall in Star-Chamber? I know that the bruite ranne that he was hardly dealt withall, be|cause he was imprisoned in the Towre, seeing his disswasion from granting a Benevolence to the King was warranted by the Law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVSTICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely Sir it was made manifest at the hea|ring, that M.S. <HI>Iohn</HI> was rather in loue with his owne letter; he confessed hee had seene your Lordships letter before hee wrote his to the Maior of Marleborough, and in your Lord|ships letter there was not a word whereto the Statutes by M^t S^t <HI>Iohn</HI> alleadged, had reference; for those Statutes did condemne the gathering of money from the Subject, vnder title of a free gift&punc; whereas a fift, a sixt, a tenth, &amp;c. was set downe and required. But my good Lord, though diuers Shires haue giuen to his Maiestie, some more, some lesse, what is this to the Kings debt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="6" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>We know it well enough, but we haue many other projects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true my good Lord: but your Lordship will find, that when by these you haue drawn many petty summs fro~ the subjects, &amp; those sometimes spent as fast as they are gathered, his Maiesty being nothing enabled thereby, when you shalbe forced to demand your <HI>great aide,</HI> the countrey will excuse it selfe in regard of their former payments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What meane you by the <HI>great aide?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I meane the aide of Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Parliament, I would faine know the man that durst perswade the King vnto it, for if it should succeed ill, in what case were he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say well for your selfe my Lord: and per|chance you that are louers of your selues (vnder pardon) do follow the advice of the late Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> who was euer opposite to all resolutions in businesse of importance; for if the things enterprized succeeded wel, the advice neuer came in question: If ill, (whereto great vndertakings are commo~|ly subiect) he then made his advantage by remembring his countrey councell: But my good Lord, these reserued Poli|titians are not the best seruants, for hee that is bound to ad|venture his life for his Master, is also bound to adventure his advice, <HI>Keep not backe councell</HI> (saith <HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI>) <HI>when it may doe good.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir, I speake it not in other respect then I think it dangerous for the King to assemble the three estates, for thereby haue our former kings alwaies lost somwhat of their <HI>prerogatiues.</HI> And because that you shall not thinke that I speake it at randome, I will begin with elder times, where|in the first contention began betwixt the Kings of this land, and their subiects in Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship shall doe me a singular fauour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> had no for|mal Parliament till about the 18^t^h yeare of <HI>Henry</HI> the first, for in his 17 yeare, for the marriage of his daughter, the King raised a tax vpon euery hide of land by the advice of his pri|vy
<PB N="3" REF="6" MS="y">
councell alone. But you may remember how the subiects soone after the establishment of this Parliament, beganne to stand vpon termes with the King, and drew from him by strong hand and the sword the <HI>great Charter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship sayes well, they drew from the King the <HI>great Charter</HI> by the sword, and hereof the Parlia|ment cannot be accused, but the Lords.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say well, but it was after the establish|ment of the Parliament, &amp; by colour of it, that they had so great daring, for before that time they could not endure to heare of S <HI>Edwards</HI> lawes, but resisted the confirmation in all they could, although by those lawes the Subjects of this Iland were no lesse free then any of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Lord, the reason is manifest; for while the <HI>Normans</HI> &amp; other of the <HI>French</HI> that followed the Con|querour, made spoyle of the <HI>English,</HI> they would not endure that any thing but the will of the Conquerour should stand for Law: but after a discent or two when themselues were become <HI>English,</HI> &amp; found themselues beaten with their own rods, they then began to sauour the difference betweene sub|jection &amp; slauery, &amp; insist vpon the law, <HI>Meum</HI> &amp; <HI>Tuum:</HI> &amp; to be able to say vnto themselues, <HI>hoc fac &amp; vives</HI>: yea that the conquering <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> did the like, your Lord|ship knowes it better than I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thinke you guesse aright: And to the end the subiect may know that being a faithfull seruant to his Prince he might enioy his own life, and paying to his Prince what belongs to a Soueraigne, the remainder was his own to dis|pose. <HI>Henry</HI> the first to content his Vassals, gaue them the great <HI>Charter,</HI> and the <HI>Charter of Forrests.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>What reaso~ then had K. <HI>Iohn</HI> to deny the co~firmatio~?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did not, but he on the co~trary confirmed both the <HI>Charters</HI> with additions, &amp; required the Pope whom he had the~ made his superior to strengthe~ him with a <HI>golde~ bul.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But your honour knowes, that it was not long after, that he repented himselfe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, &amp; he had reason so to do, for the Barons
<PB N="4" REF="7" MS="y">
refused to follow him into France, as they ought to haue done, and to say true, this <HI>great Charter</HI> vpon which you in|sist so much, was not originally granted Regally and freely: for <HI>Henry</HI> the first did vsurpe the kingdome, and therefore the better to assure himselfe against <HI>Robert</HI> his eldest bro|ther, hee flattered his Nobility and people with those Char|ters. Yea King <HI>Iohn</HI> that confirmed them had the like re|spect: for <HI>Arthur</HI> Duke of Britaine, was the vndoubted heire of the crowne, vpon whom <HI>Iohn</HI> vsurped. And so to con|clude, these Charters had their originall from Kings <HI>de facto</HI> but not <HI>de iure.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But King <HI>Iohn</HI> confirmed the Charter after the death of his Nephew <HI>Arthur,</HI> when he was then <HI>Rex de iure</HI> also.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, for he durst doe no other, standing accursed, whereby few or none obeyed him, for his Nobility refused to follow him into <HI>Scotland</HI>: and he had so grieued the people by pulling downe all the Parke pales before har|vest, to the end his deere might spoyle the Corne; And by seizing the temporalities of so many Bishoprickes into his hands, and chiefly for practizing the death of the Duke of Brittaine his Nephew, as also hauing lost <HI>Normandy</HI> to the French, so as the hearts of all men were turned from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay by your fauour my Lord. King <HI>Iohn</HI> resto|red K. <HI>Edwards</HI> Lawes after his absolution, and wrote his letters in the 15^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his reigne to all Sheriffes countermaun|ding all former oppressions, yea this he did notwithstanding the Lords refused to follow him into France.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, he did not restore King <HI>Edwards</HI> Lawes then, nor yet confirmed the Charters, but he promi|sed vpon his absolution to doe both: but after his returne out of France, in his 16^t^h yeare he denyed it, because without such a promise he had not obtained restitution, his promise being constrained, and not voluntary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what thinke you? was hee not bound in honour to performe it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="7" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainely no, for it was determined the case of King <HI>Francis</HI> the first of France, that all promises by him made, whilst he was in the hands of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth his ene|mie, were voide, by reason the Iudge of honour, which tells vs he durst doe no other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But King <HI>Iohn</HI> was not in prison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet for all that, restraint is imprisonment, yea, feare it selfe is imprisonment, and the King was subject to both: I know there is nothing more kingly in a King than the performance of his word; but yet of a word freely and voluntarily giuen. Neither was the Charter of <HI>Henry</HI> the first so published, that all men might plead it for their advantage: but a Charter was left (<HI>in deposito</HI>) in the hands of the Arch|bishop of Canterbury for the time, and so to his successours. <HI>Stephen Langthon,</HI> who was euer a Traytor to the King, pro|duced this Charter, and shewed it to the Barons, thereby en|couraging them to make warre against the King. Neither was it the old Charter simplie the Barons sought to haue co~|firmed, but they presented vnto the King other articles and orders, tending to the alteration of the whole common|wealth, which when the King refused to signe, the Barons presently put themselues into the field, and in rebellious and outragious fashion sent the King word except he confirmed them, they would not desist from making warre against him till he had satisfied them therein. And in conclusion, the king being betrayed of all his Nobility, in effect was forced to graunt the Charter of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and <HI>Charta de Fore|stis,</HI> at such time as he was invironed with an Army in the meadowes of <HI>Staynes,</HI> which Charters being procured by force, Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> afterward disavowed, &amp; threatned to curse the Barons if they submitted not themselues as they ought to their Soueraigne Lord, which when the Lords re|fused to obey, the King entertained an army of strangers for his own defence, wherewith hauing mastered &amp; beaten the Barons, they called in <HI>Lewes</HI> of France (a most vnnaturall re|solution) to be their King. Neither was <HI>Magna charta</HI> a law in the 19^t^h of <HI>Henry</HI> the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">, but simply a Charter which hee
<PB N="6" REF="8" MS="y">
confirmed in the 21^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his reigne, &amp; made it a law in the 25^t^h, according to <HI>Littletons</HI> opinion. Thus much for the be|ginning of the <HI>great Charter,</HI> which had first an obscure birth from vsurpation, and was secondly fostered &amp; shewed to the world by rebellion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but that all your Lordship hath said is true; but seeing the <HI>Charters</HI> were afterwards so many times confirmed by Parliament &amp; made lawes, &amp; that there is nothing in them vnequall or prejudicial to the King: doth not your Honour thinke it reason they should be obserued?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &amp; obserued they are in all that the state of a King can permit, for no man is destroyed but by the lawes of the land, no man disseized of his inheritance but by the lawes of the land, imprisoned they are by the prerogatiue where~ the King hath cause to suspect their loyaltie: for were it otherwise, the King should neuer come to the knowledge of any conspiracy or treason against his Person or state, and being imprisoned, yet doth not any man suffer death but by the law of the land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But may it please your Lordship, were not <HI>Corne|wallis, Sharpe,</HI> &amp; <HI>Hoskins,</HI> imprisoned, being no suspition of treason there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were, but it cost them nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what got the King by it? for in the conclusi|on (besides the murmure of the people) <HI>Cornewallis, Sharpe,</HI> &amp; <HI>Hoskins</HI> hauing greatly ouershot themselues, and repented them, a fine of 5 or 600^l was laid on his Maiesty for their of|fences, for so much their diet cost his Maiestie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know who gaue the advice, sure I am that it was none of mine: But thus I say, if you consult your me|mory, you shall finde that those kings which did in their own times confirme the <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> did not onely im|prison, but they caused of their Nobility and others to bee slaine without hearing or tryall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Lord, if you will giue me leaue to speak freely, I say, that they are not well advised that perswade the King not to admit the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> with the former re|seruations.
<PB N="7" REF="8" MS="y">
For as the King can neuer loose a farthing by it, as I shall proue anon: So except <HI>England</HI> were as <HI>Naples</HI> is, and kept by Garrisons of another Nation, it is impossible for a King of <HI>England</HI> to greaten and inrich himselfe by any way so assuredly, as by the loue of his people: For by one rebelli|on the King hath more losse then by a hundred yeares obser|vance of <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> For therein haue our Kings beene forced to compound with Roagues and Rebels, and to par|don them, yea the state of the King, the Monarchie, the No|bility haue beene endangered by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, let that passe, why should not our kings raise mony as the kings of <HI>France</HI> doe by their letters and E|dicts only? for since the time of <HI>Lewes</HI> the 11^t^h, of whom it is said, that hee freed the French Kings of their wardship, the French Kings haue seldome assembled the States for any contribution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you why; the strength of <HI>England</HI> doth consist of the people and Yeomanry, the Pesants of <HI>France</HI> haue no courage nor armes: In <HI>France</HI> euery Village and Burrough hath a castle, which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Chastean Vil|lain,</HI> euery good citty hath a good Cittadell, the king hath the Regiments of his guards and his men at armes alwayes in pay; yea the Nobility of <HI>France</HI> in whom the strength of <HI>France</HI> consists, doe alwaies assist their King in those leavies, because them selues being free, they make the same leavies vpon their tennants. But my Lord, if you marke it, <HI>France</HI> was neuer free in effect from ciuill warres, and lately it was endangered either to be conquered by the Spaniard, or to be cantonized by the rebellious French themselues, since that freedome of Wardship. But my good Lord, to leaue this di|gression, that wherein I would willingly satisfie your Lord|ship, is, that the kings of <HI>England</HI> haue neuer receiued losse by Parliament, or preiudice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Sir, you shall find that the subiects in Parlia|ment haue decreed great things to the disadvantage and dis|honour of our kings in former times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="9" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Lord, to avoide confusion, I will make a short repetition of them all, and then your Lordship may obiect where you see cause; And I doubt not but to giue your Lordship satisfaction. In the sixt yeare of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3^r^d there was no dispute, the house gaue the King two shillings of euery plough land within <HI>England,</HI> and in the end of the same yeare he had <HI>escuage</HI> paid him (to wit) for euery knights fee two markes in siluer. In the fifth yeare of that King, the Lords demaunded the confirmation of the Great Charter which the kings Councell for that time present ex|cused, alleadging that those priviledges, were extorted by force during the Kings Minoritie, and yet the King was pleased to send forth his writ to the Sheriffes of euery coun|ty, requiring them to certifie what those liberties vvere, and hovv vsed, &amp; in exchange of the Lords demaund, because they pressed him so violently, the king required all the castles &amp; places which the Lords held of his, &amp; had held in the time of his Father, vvith those Manors &amp; Lordships vvhich they had heeretofore vvrested from the Crovvne, vvhich at that time (the King being provided of forces) they durst not deny. In the 14^t^h yeare he had the 15^t^h peny of all goods giuen him vpon condition to confirme the great Charter: For by reason of the vvars in France, &amp; the losse of Rochell, hee vvas then enforced to co~sent to the Lords in all they demanded. In the 10<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters"> of his reigne hee fined the citty of London at 50000 markes, because they had receiued <HI>Lewes</HI> of France. In the 11^t^h yeare in the Parliament at Oxford, he revoked the great charter being granted vvhen he vvas vnder age, &amp; gouerned by the Earle of Pembroke, &amp; the Bishop of Winchester. In this 11^t^h yeare the Earles of Cornevvall &amp; Chester, Marshall, <HI>Edward</HI> Earle of Pembroke, <HI>Gilbert</HI> Earle of Gloucester, <HI>Warren, Hereford, Ferrars,</HI> &amp; <HI>Warwicke,</HI> &amp; others rebelled a|gainst the King, &amp; constrained him to yeeld vnto them in vvhat they demaunded for their particular interest, vvhich rebellion being appeased, he sayled into France, &amp; in his 15^t^h yeare he had a 15^t^h of the temporality, &amp; a disme &amp; a halfe of the Spirituality, and vvithall escuage of euery Knights fee.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="9" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what say you to the Parliament of <HI>Westmin|ster</HI> in the 16^t^h of the king, where notwithstanding the wars of <HI>France</HI> and his great charge in repulsing the <HI>Welsh</HI> rebels, he was flatly denyed the Subsedie demaunded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I confesse, my Lord, that the house excused them|selues by reason of their pouerty, and the Lords taking of Armes; in the next yeare it was manifest that the house was practised against the king: And was it not so, my good Lord thinke you in our two last Parliaments, for in the first euen those whom his Majestie trusted most, betrayed him in the vnion, &amp; in the seco~d there were other of the great ones ran counter. But your Lordship spake of dangers of Parliaments, in this, my Lord, there was a deniall, but there was no dan|ger at all: But to returne where I left, what got the Lords by practizing the house at that time? I say that those that brake this staffe vpon the K. were ouerturned with the counter|buffe, for hee resumed all those lands which hee had given in his minority, hee called all his exacting officers to accompt, hee found them all faulty, hee examined the corruption of o|ther magistrates, and from all these he drew sufficient mo|ny to satisfie his present necessity, whereby hee not onely spared his people, but highly contented them with an act of so great Iustice: Yea <HI>Hubert</HI> Earle of <HI>Kent,</HI> the chiefe justice whom hee had most trusted, and most advanced, was found as false to the King, as any one of the rest. And for conclu|sion in the end of that yeare at the assemblie of the States at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> the King had the fortith part of euery mans goods given him freely towards his debts, for the people, who the same yeare had refused to giue the King any thing, when they sawe hee had squeased those spunges of the common wealth, they willingly yeelded to giue him satisfacti|on.</P>

<P>But I pray you, what became of this <HI>Hubert,</HI> who~ the King had favoured aboue all men, betraying his Majestie as he did.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>There were many that perswaded the King to
<PB N="10" REF="10">
put him to death, but he could not be drawne to consent, but the King seized vpon his estate which was great; yet in the end hee left him a sufficient portion, and gaue him his life because hee had done great service in former times: For his Majestie, though hee tooke advantage of his vice, yet hee forgot not to haue consideration of his vertue. And vpon this occasion it was that the King, betrayed by those whom hee most trusted, entertayned strangers, and gaue them their offices and the charge of his castles and strong places in <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But the drawing in of those strangers was the cause that <HI>Marshall</HI> Earle of <HI>Pembroke</HI> moued warre against the King.</P>

<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, my good Lord, but hee was soone after slaine in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and his whole masculine race, ten yeres ex|tinguished, though there were fiue sonnes of them, &amp; <HI>Mar|shall</HI> being dead, who was the mouer and ring-leader of that warre, the King pardoned the rest of the Lords that had as|sisted <HI>Marshall.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What reason had the King so to doe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he was perswaded, that they loued his per|son, &amp; only hated those corrupt Counselours, that then bare the greatest sway vnder him, as also because they were the best men of warre hee had, whom if he destroyed, hauing warre with the <HI>French,</HI> he had wanted Commanders to haue served him.</P>

<P>But what reason had the Lords to take armes?</P>

<P>Because the King entertayned the <HI>Poictoui<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> were not they the Kings vassals also? Should the <HI>Spaniards</HI> rebell, because the <HI>Spanish</HI> King trusts to the <HI>Neopolitans, Por|tagues, Millanoies,</HI> and other nations his vassals, seeing those that are governed by the Vice-royes and deputies, are in pol|licy to be well entertayned and to be employed, who would otherwise devise how to free themselues; whereas, beeing trusted and imployed by their Prince, they entertaine them|selues with the hopes that other the Kings vassals doe. if the King had called in the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or other Nations, not his

Subjects, the Nobility of <HI>England</HI> had had reason of griefe. But what people did euer serue the King of <HI>England</HI> more faithfully then the <HI>Gascoynes</HI> did even to the last of the con|quest of that Duchy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship sayes wel, &amp; I am of that opinion that if it had pleased the Queene of <HI>Eng.</HI> to haue drawne some of the chiefe of the <HI>Irish</HI> Nobility into <HI>Eng.</HI> &amp; by exchange to haue made them good freeholders in <HI>Eng.,</HI> shee had saued aboue 2. millions of pounds which were consumed in times of those rebellions. For what held the great <HI>Gascoigne</HI> firme to the Crowne of <HI>England</HI> (of whom the Duke of <HI>Espernon</HI> married the inheritrix) but his Earldome of <HI>Kendall</HI> in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> whereof the Duke of <HI>Espernon</HI> (in right of his wife) beares the title to this day. And to the same end I take it, hath <HI>Iames</HI> our Soueraigne Lord given lands to divers of the No|bility of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And if I were worthy to advise your Lordship, I should thinke that your Lordship should do the King great service to put him in mind to prohibite all the <HI>Scottish</HI> nation to alienate and sell away their inheritance here; for they selling, they not only giue cause to the <HI>English</HI> to complaine that the treasure of <HI>England</HI> is transported in|to <HI>Scotland,</HI> but his Majesty is thereby also frustrated of ma|king both Nations one, and of assuring the service and obe|dience of the <HI>Scots</HI> in future.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say well, for though those of <HI>Scotland</HI> that are advanced and enriched by the Kings Majesties will, no doubt serue him faithfully, yet how their heires &amp; succes|sours, hauing no inheritance to loose in <HI>England</HI> may be se|duced is vncertaine. But let vs goe on with our Parliament. And what say you to the deniall in the 26^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> yeare of his reigne, even when the King was invited to come into <HI>France</HI> by the Earle of <HI>March,</HI> who had married his mother, and who promised to assist the King in the conquest of many places lost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, my good Lord, that a subsidy was then deni|ed, &amp; the reasons are delivered in <HI>Enlish</HI> histories, &amp; indeed the King not long before had spent much treasure in ayding
<PB N="12" REF="11" MS="y">
the Duke of Britaine to no purpose, for hee drew ouer the King but to drawe on good conditions for himselfe, as the Earle of <HI>March</HI> his father in law now did: As the English Barons did invite <HI>Lewes</HI> of <HI>France</HI> not long before, as in el|der times all the kings and states had done, and in late yeares the Leaguers of <HI>France</HI> entertayned the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Protestants and Netherlands, Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> not with any purpose to greaten those that ayde them, but to purchase to themselues an advantageous peace. But what say the histories to this deniall? they say with a world of payments there mentioned, that the King had drawne the Nobility drie. And besides, that whereas not long before great summes of mony were giuen, and the same appointed to be kept in foure castles, and not to be expended but by the aduice of the Peeres; it was beleeved that the same treasure was yet vnspent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Sir you haue said enough, judge you whe|ther it were not a dishonour to the King to be so tyed, as not to expend his treasure, but by other mens aduice as it were by their licence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely my Lord, the King was well aduised to take the mony vpon any condition, &amp; they were fooles that pro|pounded the restraint, for it doth not appeare that the King tooke any great heed to those ouerseers. <HI>Kings are bound by their piety and by no other obligation.</HI> In Queene <HI>Maries</HI> time, when it was thought that shee was with child, it was propounded in Parliament, that the rule of the Realme should bee giuen to king <HI>Philip</HI> during the minority of the hoped Prince or Princesse, and the king offered his as|surance in great summes of money to relinquish the go|vernment at such time as the Prince or Princesse should bee of age: At which motion when all else were silent in the house, Lord <HI>Dueres</HI> (who was none of the wi|sest) asked who shall sue the kinges bondes, which ended the dispute, for what bonde is betweene a king and his vas|sals, then the bond of the kinges faith) But my good Lord the king notwithstanding the deniall at that time
<PB N="13" REF="11" MS="y">
was with gifts from perticular parsons, &amp; otherwise supply|ed for proceeding of his iourney for that time into France, he tooke with him 30 caskes filled with silver and coyne which was a great treasure in those dayes. And lastly not+withstanding the first denyall in the Kings absence hee had Escuage graunted him (to wit) 20^s of euery Knights Fee.</P>

<P>What say you then to the 28<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> yeare of that King in which when the King demaunded reliefe, the states would not consent except the same former order had bin taken for the appointing of 4 overseers for the treasure.

<P>My good Lord admit the King had yeelded their de|maunds, then whatsoever had beene ordained by those ma|gistrates to the dislike of the Common wealth, the people had beene without remedie, whereas while the King made them they, had their appeale and other remedies. But those demaunds vanished and in the end the King had escuage gi|uen him without any of their conditions. It is an excellent vertue in a King to haue patience and to giue way to the fu|ry of mens passions. The whale when he is stroken by the fi|sherman, growes into that fury, that he cannot be resisted, but will overthrowe all the ships and barkes that come in to his way, but when he hath tumbled a while, hee is drawne to the shore with a twind thred.</P>

<SPEAKER>COVNS:</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you then to the Parliament in the 29^t^h of that King.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>I say that the commons being vnable to pay, the king relieues himselfe vpon the richer sort, and soe it likewise happened in the 33 of that king, in which hee was relieued chiefely by the Citty of London. But my good Lord in the Parliament in London in the 38 yeare, he had giuen him the tenth of all the revenues of the Church for three yeares, and 3 markes of every knights Fee throughout the kingdome vpo~ his promise &amp; oath vpon the obscruing of <HI>magna Charta</HI> but in the end of the same yeare, the king being the~ in France, he was denyed the aydes which he required. What is this to
<PB N="14" REF="12">
the danger of a Parliament? especially at this time they had reason to refuse, they had giuen so great a some in the begin|ning of the same yeare. And again because it was known that the King had but pretended warre with the king of Castile with whome he had secretly contracted an alliance and con|cluded a marriage betwixt his sonne <HI>Edward</HI> and the Lady <HI>Elenor.</HI> These false fires doe but freight Children and it commonly falles out that when the cause giuen is knowne to be false, the necessity pretended is thought to be fained, Royall dealing hath euermore Royall successe: and as the King was denied in the eight &amp; thirtyeth yeare, so was he de|nyed in the nine &amp; thirtieth yeare, because the Nobility and the people saw, that the King was abused by the Pope it plain|ly who aswell in despite to <HI>Manfred</HI> bastard son to the Em|perour <HI>Fredericke</HI> the second, as to cozen the King and to wast him, would needes bestowe on the King the kingdome of Sicilie, to recouer which, the King sent all the treasure he could borrow or scrape to the Pope, and withall gaue him letters of credence, for to take vp what he could in Italy, the King binding himselfe for the payment. Now my good Lord the wisdome of Princes is seen in nothing more then in their enterprises. So how vnpleasing it was to the State of En|gland to consume the treasure of the land, &amp; in the conquest of Sicily so farre of, and otherwise for that the English had lost Normandy vnder their noses and so many goodly parts of France of their owne proper inheritances: the reason of the deniall is as well to be considered as the denyall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was not the King also denyed a subsidie in the fourty first of his raigne?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my Lord, for although the King required mo|ny as before for the impossible conquest of Sicily, yet the house offered to giue 52000 markes, which whether hee re|fused or accepted is vncertaine, &amp; whilst the King dreamed of Sicily, the Welsh inuaded &amp; spoyled the borders of En|gland, for in the Parliament of London, when the King vrged the house for the prosecuting the co~quest of Sicily, the Lords vtterly disliking the attempt, vrged the prosecuting of the
<PB N="15" REF="12" MS="y">
Welshmen: which Parlament being proroged did again as|semble at Oxford, &amp; was called the madde Parlame~t, which was no other the~ an assembly of rebels, for the Royall assent of the K. which giues life to all lawes, form'd by the three estates, was not a Royal assent, when both the K. &amp; the Prince were co~strained to yeeld to the Lords. A co~strained consent is the consent of a Captiue &amp; not of a K., &amp; therefore there was nothing done there either legally or royally. For if it be not properly a Parliament where the subiect is not free, cer|tainely it can be none where the King is bound, for all King|ly rule was taken from the King, and twelue Peeres appoin|ted, and as some writers haue it 24 Peeres, to gouerne the Realme, and therefore the assembly made by <HI>Iack Strawe</HI> &amp; other rebels may aswell bee called a Parliament as that of Oxford. <HI>Principis nomen habere, non est esse Princeps,</HI> for there|by was the King driuen not only to co~pou~d all quarrels with the French, but to haue meanes to be revenged on the rebell Lords: but he quitted his right to Norma~dy Aniou &amp; Mayne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But sir what needed this extremity, seeing the Lords required but the confirmation of the former Charter, which was not preiudiciall to the King to graunt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes my good Lord, but they insulted vpon the King and would not suffer him to enter into his own castles, they put downe the Purvey or of the meate for the mainte|nance of his house as if the King had beene a bankrupt, and gaue order that without ready money he should not take vp a Chicken. And though there is nothing against the royalty of a King in these Charters (the Kings of England beeing Kings of freemen and not of slaues) yet it is soe contrary to the nature of a King to bee forced euen to those thinges which may be to his advantage, as the King had some reason to seeke the dispensation of his oath from the Pope, and to drawe in strangers for his owne defence: yea <HI>Iure saluo Co|ronae nostrae</HI> is intended inclusiuely in all oathes and promises exacted from a Soueraigne.</P>

<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true my good Lord, that there is nothing so daungerous for a King as to be constrained and held as pri|soner to his vassals, for by that, <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and <HI>Ri|chard</HI> the second lost their Kingdomes and their liues. And for calling in of strangers, was not King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth driuen to call instrangers against the rebels in Norfolke, Cornewall, Oxfordshire and elsewhere? Haue not the K^s. of Scotland beene oftentimes constrained to entertaine stran|gers against the Kings of England, And the King of England at this time had he not bin diuerse times assisted by the Kings of Scotla~d, had bin enda~gered to haue bin expelled for ever.</P>

<P>Yea my good Lord being Prisoners, being out of possession and being in their hands that were Princes of the blood and pretenders. It is an old countrey prouerbe: (that <HI>might overcomes right</HI>) a weake title that weares a strong sword, commonly prevailes against a strong title that weares but a weake one, otherwise <HI>Philip</HI> the second had never bin Duke of Portugal, nor Duke of Millayne, nor K. of Naples &amp; Scicilie. But good Lord <HI>Errores not sunt trah&punc; udi in exem|plum</HI>: I speake of regall, peaceable, and lawfull Parliaments. The King at this time was but a King in name, for Glocester, Leycester and Chichester made choise of other Nyne, to whom the rule of the Realme was committed, &amp; the Prince was forced to purchase his liberty fro~ the Earle of Leycester, by giuing for his ransome the County Pallatine of Chester. But my Lord let vs judge of those occasions by their events, what became of this proud Earle? was hee not soone after slaine in Euesham? was he not left naked in the field, and left a shamefull spectacle, his head being cut off from his shoul|ders, his priuy parts from his body &amp; laid on each side of his nose? And did not God extinguish his race, after which in a lawfull parliament at Westminster (confirmed in a follow|ing parliament of Westminster, were not all the Lords that
<PB N="17" REF="13" MS="y">
followed Leycester disinherited? And when that foole Glo|cester, after the death of Leycester (whom he had formerly forsaken) made himselfe the head of a second rebellion, and called in strangers, for which not lo~g before he had cried out against the K. was not hee in the end, after that hee had seene the slaughter of so many of the Barons&punc; the spoile of their ca|stles, &amp; Lordships constrained to submit himselfe, as all the suruiuers did, of which they that sped best&punc; payd their sines and ransomes, the King reserving to his younger sonne, the Earledomes of Leycester and Derby.</P>

<P>Well sir, we haue disputed this King to his graue, though it be true, that he outliued all his enimies, &amp; brought them to confusion, yet those examples did not terrifie their successors, but the Earle Marshall, and Hereford, threatned King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, with a new warre.</P>

<P>They did so, but after the death of Hereford, the Earle Marshall repented himselfe, and to gaine the Kings fa|vour, he made him heire of all his lands.

In the two and thirtyeth yeare he had a subsedy freely graunted. In the three and thirtyeth yeare hee confirmed the great Charter of his owne Royall disposition, and the states to shew their thank|fulnesse, gaue the king for one yeare, the fift part of all the revenues of the land and of the Citizens the sixt part of their goods.

This commission likewise did enquire of intruders, barrators &amp; all other the like vermine, whereby the king gathered a great masse of treasure with a great deale of loue.

<P>It is true my Lord, but that is nothing to our sub|iect of Parliament, they may thanke their owne insolencie, for they branded &amp; despised the Queene, whom they ought to haue honored as the Kings wife; they were also exceeding greedy, &amp; built the~selues vpon other mens ruines, they were ambitious &amp; exceeding malitious, wherevpon that came,

<P>Well Sir, you haue all this while excused your selfe vpon the strength and rebellions of the Lords, but what say you now to King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in whose time (and during the time of this victorious king, no man durst take Armes or rebel) the three estates did him the greatest affront that euer king receiued or endured, therefore I conclude where I began, that these Parliaments are dangerous for a king.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>To answere your Lordship in order, may it please you first to call minde, what was giuen this great king by his Subjects before the dispute betwixt him and the house happened, which was in his latter dayes, from his first yeare to his fift yeare there was nothing giuen the king by his sub|jects: In his eight yeare at the Parliament at <HI>London</HI> a tenth and a fifteenth was graunted: in his tenth yeare hee ceased vpon the <HI>Italians</HI> goods heere in <HI>England</HI> to his owne vse, with all the goods of the <HI>Monkes Cluniacqs</HI> and others, of the order of the <HI>Cistertians.</HI> In the eleuenth yeare, hee had given him by parliament a notable relief, the one halfe of the woolls throughout <HI>England,</HI> and of the Cleargy all their wools, after which, in the end of the yeare hee had granted in his parliament at <HI>Westminster,</HI> forty shillings vpon every sacke of wool, and for every thirty wool fels forty shillings, for every last of leatherne, as much, and for all other mer|chandizes after the same rate. The king promising that this yeares gathering ended, he would thenceforth content him|selfe with the old custome, he had ouer and aboue this great ayde the eight part of all goods of all citizens and Burgesses, and of others as of forreigne Marchants, &amp; such as liued not of the gaine of breeding of sheepe and cattell the fifteenth of their goods: Nay my Lord: this was not all: though more then euer was granted to any king, for the same parliament bestowed on the king the ninth sheafe of all the corne with|in the lande, the ninth fleece, and the ninth lambe for two

<P>I say they were honest men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>And I say, the people are as loving to their king now, as euer they were, if they bee honestly and wisely dealt withall, and so his Majestie hath found them in his last two parliaments, if his Majestie had not beene betrayed by those whom he most trusted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I pray you Sir, who shall a king trust, if he may not trust those whom he hath so greatly advanced?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell your Lordship whom the king may trust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>His owne reason, and his owne excellent judge|ment which haue not deceived him in any thing, wherein his Majestie hath beene pleased to exercise them, <HI>Take coun|cell of thine heart</HI> (saith the booke of Wisedome) <HI>for there is none more faithfull vnto thee then it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, but his Majestie found that those wan|ted no judgement whom hee trusted, and how could his Majestie divine of their honesties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you pardon mee if I speake freely, for if I speake out of <HI>loue,</HI> which (as <HI>Salomon</HI> saith) <HI>covereth all tres|passes,</HI> The trueth is, that his Majestie would never beleeue any man that spake against them, and they knew it well e|nough, which gaue them boldnesse to do what they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even, my good Lord, to ruine the kings estate so farre as the state of so great a king may be ruin'd by men am|bitious and greedy without proportion. It had beene a braue increase of revenue, my Lord, to haue raysed 50000&prime; land of the kings to 20000&prime; revenue, and to raise the revenue of wards to 20000&prime; more, 40000&prime; added to the rest of his Ma|jesties estate, had so enabled his Majestie, as hee could never haue wanted. And my good Lord, it had beene an honest ser|vice to the king, to haue added 7000&prime; lands of the Lord <HI>Cob|hams,</HI> woods and goods being worth 30000&prime; more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="16">
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not the reason why it was not done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither doth your Lordship, perchance knowe the reason why the 10000&prime; offer'd by <HI>Swinnerton</HI> for a fine of the <HI>French</HI> wines, was by the then Lord Treasurer conferr'd on <HI>Devonshire</HI> and his <HI>Mistris.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What moued the Treasurer to reject &amp; crosse that raising of the kings lands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The reason, my good Lord, is manifest, for had the land beene raised, then had the king knowne when hee had given or exchanged land, what hee had giuen or exchan|ged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What hurt had that beene to the Treasurer whose office is truely to informe the King of the value of all that he giveth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>So hee did when it did not concerne himselfe nor his particular, for hee could neuer admit any one peece of a good Manour to passe in my Lord <HI>Aubignes</HI> booke of 1000&prime; land, till hee himselfe had bought, &amp; then all the remaining flowers of the Crowne were culled out. Now had the Trea|surer suffer'd the Kings lands to haue been raised, how could his Lordshippe haue made choice of the old rents, as well in that book of my Lord <HI>Aubigne,</HI> as in exchange of <HI>Theobalds,</HI> for which hee tooke <HI>Hatfield</HI> in it, which the greatest sub|ject or favorite Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had never durst haue na|med vnto her by way of gift or exchange. Nay my Lord, so many other goodly Mannors haue passed from his Majestie, as the very heart of the kingdome mourneth to remember it, and the eyes of the kingdome shedde teares continually at the beholding it&punc; yea the soule of the kingdome is heavy vnto death with the consideration thereof, that so magna|nimous a Prince, should suffer himselfe to be so abused.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir you knowe that <HI>Cobhams</HI> lands were entayled vpon his Cosens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, my Lord, but during the liues and races of <HI>George Brooke</HI> his children, it had beene the kings, that is to say, for euer in effect, but to wrest the king, and to draw the inheritance vpon himselfe, he perswaded his Majestie to re|linquish
<PB N="24" REF="17" MS="y">
his interest for a petty summe of money; and that there might be no counterworking, he sent <HI>Brooke</HI> 6000^l to make friends, vvhereof himselfe had 2000^l backe againe, <HI>Buckhurst</HI> and <HI>Barwicke</HI> had the other 4000^l, and the Trea|surer and his heires the masse of land for euer.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then I pray you came to the king by this great confiscation.</P>

<P>My Lord, the kings Majestie by all those goodly possessio~s, vvoods &amp; goods looseth 500^l by the yere which he giueth in pension to <HI>Cobham,</HI> to maintaine him in prison.</P>

<P>Certainly, even in conscience they should haue re|served so much of the land in the Crowne, as to haue giuen <HI>Cobham</HI> meate and apparell, &amp; not made themselues so great gainers, and the King 500^l (<HI>per annum</HI>) looser by the bar|gaine, but it's past: <HI>Consilium non est eorum quae fieri neque|unt.</HI></P>

<P>Take the rest of the sentence, my Lord: <HI>Sed consili|um versatur in iis quae sunt in nostra potestate.</HI> It is yet, my good Lord, <HI>in potestate Regis,</HI> to right himselfe.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray doe so, and amongst the rest, <HI>I</HI> pray you what say you to the Parliament holden at <HI>London</HI> in the fif|teenth yeare of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say there was nothing concluded therein to the prejudice of the King. It is true, that a litle before the sitting of the house, the King displaced his Chancellour and his Treasurer, and most of all his judges and officers of the ex|chequer, and committed many of them to prison, because they did not supplie him with mony being beyond the seas, for the rest, the states assembled, besought the King that the lawes of the two Charters might bee obserued, and that the great officers of the Crowne might bee chosen by parlia|ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what successe had these petitions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Charters were observed, as before, &amp; so they
<PB N="25" REF="17" MS="y">
wilbe euer, &amp; the other petition was reiected, the King be|ing pleas'd notwithstanding, that the great Officers should take an oath in Parliament to doe Iustice. Now for the Par|liament of <HI>Westminster,</HI> in the 17^t^h yeare of the King, the King had three markes and a halfe for euery sacke of wooll transported; and in his 18^t^h he had a 10^t^h of the Clergy, and a 15^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Laity for one yeare. His Maiesty forbare after this to charge his subiects with any more payments, vntill the 29^t^h of his reigne, when there was giuen the King by Parliament 50 for euery sacke of wooll transported for sixe yeares, by which grant, the King receiued a thousand marks a day, a greater matter then a thousand pounds in these dayes, &amp; a 1000^l a day amounts to 365000 a yeare, which was one of the greatest presents that euer was giuen to a King of this land. For besides the cheapnes of all things in that age, the Kings souldiers had but 3^d a day wages, a man at armes 6^l, a Knight but 2^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">. In the Parliament at <HI>Westmin|ster,</HI> in the 33^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> yeare he had 26^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> 8^d for euery sacke of wooll transported, &amp; in the 42^t^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> yeare 3 dismes &amp; 3 fifteens. In his 45^l yeare he had 50000 of the Layty, &amp; because the Spiri|tualty disputed it, &amp; did not pay so much, the King chang'd his Chancellour, Treasurer, and Privy Seale, being Bishops, and placed Lay men in their roome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seemes that in those dayes the kings were no longer in loue with their great Chancellors, then when they deserued well of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my Lord, they were not, &amp; that was the reason they were well serued, &amp; it was the custome then, &amp; in many ages after, to change the Treasurer &amp; the Chancellour euery 3 yeares, &amp; withall to heare all mens complaints against the~.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But by this often change, the saying is verifi|ed, that there is no inheritance in the fauour of Kings. <HI>Hee that keepeth the figge tree</HI> (saith <HI>Salomon</HI>) <HI>shall eat the fruite thereof</HI>; for reason it is that the seruant liue by the Master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you say well in both, but had the subiect an inheritance in the Princes favor, where the Prince hath no inheritance in the subiects fidelity, then were kings in more
<PB N="26" REF="18" MS="y">
vnhappy estate then common persons. For the rest, <HI>Salomon</HI> meaneth not, that he that <HI>keepeth the figge tree</HI> should surfet, though he meant he should eate, hee meant not hee should breake the branches in gathering the figs, or eate the ripe, &amp; leaue the rotten for the owner of the tree; for what saith hee in the following chapter, he saith that <HI>he that maketh haste to be rich, cannot be innocent.</HI> And before that, he saith, that <HI>the end of an inheritance hastily gotten, cannot be blessed.</HI> Your Lordship hath heard of few or none great with Kings, that haue not vsed their power to oppresse, that haue not grown insolent &amp; hatefull to the people; yea, insolent towards those Princes that advanced them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet you see that Princes can change their fancies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea my Lord, when favorites change their faith, when they forget that how familiar socuer Kings make the~|selues with their Vassals, yet they are kings: <HI>He that provo|keth a King to anger</HI> (saith <HI>Salomon</HI>) <HI>sinneth against his owne soule.</HI> And he further saith, that <HI>pride goeth before destruction, and a high minde before a fall.</HI> I say therefore, that in dischar|ging those Lucifers, how deare soeuer they haue beene, kings make the world know that they haue more of Iudge|ment then of passion, yea they thereby offer a satisfactory sacrifice to all their people, too great benefits of subjects to their King, where the minde is blowne vp with their owne deseruings, and too great benefits of Kings confer'd vpon their subiects, where <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word"> minde is not qualified with a great deale of modesty, are equally dangerous. Of this later and insolenter, had King <HI>Richard</HI> the second deliuered vp to Iu|stice but three or foure, he had still held the loue of the peo|ple, and thereby his life and estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I pray you goe on with your Parlia|ments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The life of this great King <HI>Edward</HI> drawes to an end, so doe the Parliaments of this time, where in 50 yeares raigne, he neuer receiued any affront, for in his 49^t^h yeare he had a disme and a fifteene granted him freely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="18" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir it is an olde saying, that all is well that ends well: Iudge you whether that in his 50^t^h yeare in Par|liament at <HI>Westminster</HI> hee receiued not an affront, when the house vrged the King to remoue &amp; discharge fro~ his presence the Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the Lord <HI>Latimer</HI> his Chamberlaine, Sir <HI>Richard Sturry,</HI> and others whom the King fauoured and trusted. Nay, they pressed the King to thrust a certaine Lady out of the Court, which at that time bare the greatest sway therein.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will with patience answere your Lordship to the full, and first your Lordship may remember by that which I euen now said, that neuer King had so many gifts as this King had from his subiects, and it hath neuer grieued the subiects of <HI>England</HI> to giue to their King, but when they knew there was a devouring Lady, that had her share in all things that passed, and the Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> was as scra|ping as shee, that the Chancellour did eat vp the people as fast as either of them both. It grieued the subjects to feede these Cormorants. But my Lord there are two things by which the Kings of <HI>England</HI> haue beene prest, (to wit) by their subiects, and by their owne necessities. The Lords in former times were farre stronger, more warlike, better fol|lowed, liuing in their countries, then now they are. Your Lordship may remember in your reading, that there were many Earles could bring into the field a thousand Barbed horses, many a Baron 5 or 600 Barbed horses, whereas now very few of them can furnish twenty fit to serue the King. But to say the truth my Lord, the Iustices of Peace in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> haue oppos'd the iniusticers of warre in <HI>England,</HI> the kings writ runs ouer all, &amp; the great Scale of <HI>England,</HI> with that of the next Constables will serue the turne to affront the greatest Lords in <HI>England</HI> that shall moue against the King. The force therefore by which our Kings in former times were troubled, is vanisht away. But the necessities remaine. The people therefore in these later ages, are no lesse to bee pleased then the Peeres; for as the later are become lesse, so by reason of the trayning through <HI>England,</HI> the Commons
<PB N="28" REF="19" MS="y">
haue all the weapons in their hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was it not so euer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my good Lord, for the Noblemen had in their Armories to furnish some of the~ a thousand, some two thousand, some three thousand men, whereas now there are not many that can arme fifty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you blame them? But I will only answere for my selfe, betweene you &amp; me be it spoken, I holde it not safe to maintaine so great an Armory or Stable, it might cause me, or any other Nobleman to be suspected, as the pre|paring of some Innovation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so my Lord, rather to bee commended as preparing against all danger of Innovation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It should be so, but call your observation to ac|compt, &amp; you shall find it as I say, for (indeed) such a jelou|sie hath been held euer since the time of the Ciuill wars, ouer the Military greatnes of our Nobles, as made them haue litle will to bend their studies that wayes: wherefore let euery man prouide according as hee is rated in the Muster booke, you vnderstand me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well my Lord, as what might be replyed in the preceiuing so much; I haue euer (to deale plainly and freely with your Lordship) more fear'd at home popular violence, then all the forreine that can be made, for it can ne|uer bee in the power of any forreine Prince, without a Pa|pisticall party, either to disorder or endanger his Majesties Estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this it seemes, it is no lesse dangerous for a king to leaue the power in the people, then in the Nobility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Lord, the wisdome of our owne age, is the foolishnes of another, the time present ought not to bee prefer'd to the Policy that was, but the policy that was, to the time present. So that the power of the Nobility being now withered, and the power of the people in the flowre, the care to content them would not be neglected, the way to win them often practized, or at least to defend them from oppression. The motiue of all dangers that euer this Monar|chy
<PB N="29" REF="19" MS="y">
hath vndergone, should bee carefully heeded, for this Maxime hath no posterne, <HI>Potestas humana radicatur in voluntatibus hominum.</HI> And now my Lord, for King <HI>Edward</HI> it is true, though he were not subject to force, yet was hee subiect to necessity, which because it was violent, hee gaue way vnto it, <HI>Potestas</HI> (saith <HI>Pythagoras</HI>) <HI>iuxia necessitatem habitat.</HI> And it is true, that at the request of the house he dis|charged &amp; put from him those before named, which done, he had the greatest gift (but one) that euer he receiued in all his dayes (to wit) from euery person, man &amp; woman aboue the age of fourteen yeares. 4^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> of old mony, which made ma|ny Millions of Groats, worth 6^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> of our mony. This he had in generall, besides he had of euery beneficed Priest, 12^d. And of the Nobility &amp; Gentry, I know not how much, for it is not set down. Now my good Lord, what lost the King by satis|fying the desires of the Parliament house; for assoone as hee had the money in purse, hee recalled the Lords, and restored them, &amp; who durst call the King to accompt, when the As|sembly were dissolued. <HI>Where the word of a King is, there is power</HI> (saith <HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI>) <HI>who shall say vnto him, what doest thou?</HI> saith the same Author, for euery purpose there is a time &amp; judgment, the King gaue way to the time, &amp; his judgme~t persweded him to yeeld to necessity, <HI>Consularius nemo meli|or est qu&agrave;m tempus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But yet you see the king was forc'd to yeeld to their demaunds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doth your Lordship remember the saying of <HI>Mon|sieur de Lange,</HI> that he that hath the profit of the warre, hath also the honour of the warre, whether it be by battaile or re|treate, the King you see had the profit of the Parliament, and therefore the honour also, what other end had the king then to supply his wants. A wise man hath euermore respect vn|to his ends: And the king also knew that it was the loue that the people bare him, that they vrged the remouing of those Lords, there was no man among them that sought himselfe in that desire, but they all sought the King, as by the suc|cesse it appeared. My good Lord, hath it not been ordinary
<PB N="30" REF="20" MS="y">
in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>France</HI> to yeeld to the demaunds of rebels, did not King <HI>Richard</HI> the second graunt pardon to the out|ragious roagues &amp; murtherers that follovved <HI>Iack Straw, &amp; Wat Tyler,</HI> after they had murthered his Chancellor, his Trea|surer, Chiefe Iustice, and others, brake open his Exchequer, and committed all manner of outrages and villanies, and why did he doe it, but to avoid a greater danger: I say the Kings haue then yeelded to those that hated them and their estates, (to wit) to pernicious rebels. And yet without dishonour shall it be called dishonour for the King to yeeld to honest desires of his subjects. No my Lord, those that tell the King those tales, feare their own dishonour, and not the Kings, for the honour of the King is supreame, and being guarded by Iustice and piety, it cannot receiue neither wound nor stayne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir, what cause haue any about our King to feare a Parliament?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same cause that the Earle of <HI>Suffolke</HI> had in <HI>Richard</HI> the seconds time, and the Treasurer <HI>Fartham,</HI> with others; for these great Officers being generally hated for ab|using both the King and the subiect, at the request of the States were discharged, and others put in their roomes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was not this a dishonour to the king?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly no, for King <HI>Richard</HI> knew that his Grandfather had done the like, and though the king was in his heart vtterly against it, yet had hee the profite of this exchange; for <HI>Suffolke</HI> was fined at 20000 markes, &amp; 1000^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> lands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well Sir, we will speake of those that feare the Parliament some other time, but I pray you goe on with that, that happened in the troublesome raigne of <HI>Richard</HI> the second who succeeded, the Grandfather beeing dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>That king, my good Lord, was one of the most vnfortunate Princes that euer <HI>England</HI> had, hee was cruell, extreame prodigall, and wholly carryed away with his two Minions, <HI>Suffolk</HI>&punc; &amp; the duke of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by whose ill advice &amp;
<PB N="31" REF="20" MS="y">
others, he was in danger to haue lost his estate; which in the end (being led by men of the like temper) he miserably lost. But for his subsedies hee had giuen him in his first yeare be|ing vnder age two tenths, and two fifteenes: In which Par|liament, <HI>Alice Peirce,</HI> who was remoued in king <HI>Edwards</HI> time, with <HI>Lancaster, Latimer,</HI> and <HI>Sturry.</HI> were confiscate &amp; banished. In his second yeare at the Parliament at <HI>Glocester,</HI> the King had a marke vpon euery sacke of wooll, and 6^d the pound vpon wards. In his third yeare at the Parliament at <HI>Winchester,</HI> the Commons were spared, and a subsedy giuen by the better sort, the Dukes gaue 20 markes, and Earles 6 markes, Bishoppes and Abbots with myters fixe markes, e|uery marke 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> 4^d, &amp; euery Knight, Iustice, Esquier, Shrieue, Parson, Vicar, &amp; Chaplaine, paid proportionably according to their estates.</P>

<P>This me thinkes was no great matter.</P>

<P>That vvas not the fault of the Parliament my Lord, it is manifest that the subsedy giuen vvas not the cause; for it is plaine that the bondmen of <HI>England</HI> began it, because they vvere grieuously prest by their Lords in their tenure of Villenage, as also for the hatred they bare to the Lavv|yers &amp; Attorneyes: for the story of those times say, that they destroyed the houses &amp; Mannors of men of lavv, and such Lavvyers as they caught, slevv them, &amp; beheaded the Lord

chiefe Iustice, which commotion being once begun, the head mony was by other Rebels pretended: A fire is often kind|led with a litle straw, which oftentimes takes hold of great|er timber, &amp; consumes the whole building: And that this Rebellion was begun by the discontented slaues (whereof there haue beene many in Elder times the like) is manifest by the <HI>Charter</HI> of <HI>Manumission,</HI> which the King granted <HI>in haec verba&punc; Rich.

<P>No my Lord, it was to haue the oversight of those Officers, which (saith the Story) had imbezeled, lewdly wa|sted, and prodigally spent the Kings treasure, for to the Co~|mission to those Lords, or to any six of them, joyn'd with the Kings Counsell, was one of the most royall and most profi|table that euer he did, if hee had bin constant to himself. But my good Lord, man is the cause of his own misery, for I wil repeate the substance of the commission granted by the K&punc; &amp; confirmed by Parliament, which, whether it had bin pro|fitable for the K. to haue prosecuted, your Lordship may judge. The preamble hath these words: <HI>Whereas our Sove|reigne Lord the King perceiveth by the greivous complaints of the Lords &amp; Commons of this Realme, that the rents, profits, &amp; revenues of this Realme, by the singular and insufficient Coun|cell and evill gouernment, aswell of some his late great Officers, and others, &amp;c. are so much withdrawen, wasted, eloyued, giuen, granted, alienated, destroyed, and evill dispended, that he is so much impoverished and void of treasure and goods, and the sub|stance of the Crown so much diminished and destroyed, that his estate may not honorably be sustained as appertayneth. The K. of his free will at the request of the Lords and Commons, hath or|dayned</HI> Willia~ <HI>Archbishop of</HI> Canterbury <HI>and others with his Chancellour, Treasurer, keeper of his privy seale, to survey and examine as well the estate and governance of his house, &amp;c. as of all the rents, and profits, and revenues that to him appertay|neth, and to be due, or ought to appertaine and be due, &amp;c. And all manner of gifts, graunts, alienations and confirmations made by him of lands, tenements, rents, &amp;c. bargained and sold to the preiudice of him and his Crowne, &amp;c.

<P><PB N="34" REF="22" MS="y">This is in effect the substance of the commission, which your Lordship may reade at large in the booke of Statutes, this commission being enacted in the tenth yere of the Kings reigne.

And if your Lordship vvill disdaine it at your own servants hands, much more ought the great heart of a King, to disdaine it.

<P>Because these, against vvhom it was graunted, per|swaded the King to the contrary: As the Duke of <HI>Ireland, Suffolke,</HI> the chief Iustice <HI>Trisilian,</HI> &amp; others, yea, that which vvas lawfully done by the King, and the great Councell of the kingdome, was (by the mastery which <HI>Ireland, Suffolke,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="22" MS="y">
and <HI>Tresilian</HI> had ouer the Kings affections) broken and dis|avowed. Those that devised to relieue the King, not by any private invention, but by generall Councell, were by a pri|vate and partiall assemblie, adjudged traytors, and the most honest Iudges of the land, enforced to subscribe to that judg|ment. In so much, that Iudge <HI>Belknap</HI> plainely told the Duke of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Earle of <HI>Suffolke,</HI> when hee was constrai|ned to set to his hand, plainely told these Lords, that he wan|ted but a rope, that he might therewith receiue a reward for his subscription. And in this Councell of <HI>Nottingham</HI> vvas hatched the ruine of those which governed the King, of the Iudges by them constrained, of the Lords that loued the King, and sought a reformation, and of the King himselfe; for though the King found by all the Shreeues of the shires, that the people would not fight against the Lords, whom they thought to bee most faithfull vnto the King, when the Citi|zens of <HI>London</HI> made the same answere, beeing at that time able to arme 50000<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> men, &amp; told the Major, that they would never fight against the Kings friends, and defenders of the Realme, when the Lord <HI>Ralph Basset,</HI> who was neere the K. told the King boldly, that hee would not adventure to haue his head broken for the Duke of <HI>Irelands</HI> pleasure, vvhen the Lord of <HI>London</HI> told the Earle of <HI>Suffolke</HI> in the Kings presence, that he was not worthy to liue, &amp;c. yet vvould the King in the defence of the destroyers of his estate, lay am|bushes to entrap the Lords, when they came vpon his faith, yea when all was pacified, and that the King by his Procla|mation had clear'd the Lords, and promised to produce <HI>Ire|land, Suffolke,</HI> &amp; the Archbishop of <HI>Yorke, Tresilian</HI> &amp; <HI>Bram|ber,</HI> to answer at the next Parliament, these men confest, that they durst not appeare; and when <HI>Suffolke</HI> fled to <HI>Callice,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Chester,</HI> the King caused an army to be leavied in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> for the safe conduct of the Duke of <HI>Ireland</HI> to his presence, when as the Duke being encounte|red by the Lords, ranne like a coward from his company, &amp; fled into <HI>Holland.</HI> After this vvas holden a Parliament, which vvas called that vvrought vvonders.

<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly in raising an army, they committed trea|son, and though it did appeare, that they all loued the King, (for they did him no harme, hauing him in their power) yet our law doth construe all leavying of war without the kings commission, and all force raised to be intended for the death &amp; destruction of the K. not attending the sequell. And it is so judged vpon good reason, for every vnlawfull and ill action is suppos'd to be accompanied with an ill inte~t. And besides, those Lords vsed too great cruelty, in procuring the sen|tence of death against diuers of the Kings servaunts, who were bound to follow and obey their Master and Soveraigne Lord, in that hee commaunded.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, and they were also greatly to blame, to cause then so many seconds to be put to death, seeing the principalls, <HI>Ireland, Suffolke</HI>&punc; and <HI>Yorke</HI> had escaped them. And what reason had they to seeke to enforme the State by strong hand, was not the Kinges estate as deere to himselfe, as to them? He that maketh a King know his errour maner|ly and priuate, and giues him the best aduice, hee is dischar|ged before God, and his owne conscience.

<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, the taking of Armes cannot be excused in respect of the law, but this might be said for the Lords that the K. being vnder yeres, &amp; being wholly governed by their enimies, &amp; the enimies of the kingdome, &amp; because by those evill mens perswasio~s, it was aduised, how the Lords should haue bin murthered at a feast in <HI>London,</HI> they were excusable during the kings minority to stand vpo~ their guards against

their particular enemies. But we will passe it ouer and go on with our parliaments that followed, whereof that of Cam|bridge in the K^s 12^t^h yeare was the next, therein the K. had giuen him a 10^t^h &amp; a 15^t^h, after which, being 20. yeares of age recha~ged (saith <HI>H.

Hee also tooke the Admirals place fro~ the Earle of Arundell, &amp; in his roome hee placed the Earle of Huntingdon in the yeare following, which was the 13^t^h yeare of the K. in the Parliament at West|minster, there was giuen to the King vpon every sacke of wooll 14^s and 6^d in the pound vpon other marchandize.</P>

<P>But by your leaue, the King was restrained this parliament, that he might not dispose of, but a third part of the money gathered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>No my Lord, by your fauour. But true it is that part of this mony was by the Kings consent assigned towards the wars, but yet left in the Lord Treasurers hands, And my Lo: it would be a great ease, &amp; a great sauing to his Maiestie our Lord and Master, if it pleased him to make his assignations vpon some part of his revenewes, by which he might haue 1000<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> vpon every 10000<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">, and saue himselfe a great deale of clamour. For seeing of necessity the Nauy must be maintai|ned, &amp; that those poore men aswell Carpenters as ship kee|pers must be paid, it were better for his Maiesty to giue an assignation to the treasurer of his nauy for the receiuing of so much as is called ordinary, then to discontent those poore men, who being made desperate beggers, may perchance be corrupted by them that lye in waite to destroy the K^s estate. And if his Maiesty did the like in all other payments, especi|ally where the necessity of such as are to receiue, cannot pos|sible giues daies, his Maiesty might then in a litle rowle be|hold his receipts and expences, hee might quiet his heart when all necessaries were provided for, and then dispose the rest at his pleasure. And my good Lord, how excellently and easily might this haue bin done, if the 400000<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> had beene raised as aforesaid vpon the Kings lands, and wards, I say that his Maiesties house, his navy, his guards, his pensioners,
<PB N="38" REF="24" MS="y">
his munition, his Ambassadors and all else of ordinary charge might haue beene defrayed, and a great summe left for his Maiesties casuall expences and rewards, I will not say they were not in loue with the Kings estate, but I say they were vnfortunately borne for the King that crost it.</P>

No Sir, what will become of our New-yeares gifts, our presents and gra|tuities? We can now say to those that haue warrants for mo|ney, that there is not a penny in the Exchequer, but the king giues it away vnto the Scots faster then it comes in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord you say well, at least you say the trueth, that such are some of our answeres, and hence comes that generall murmure to all men that haue money to receiue, I say that there is not a penny giuen to that nation, be it for ser|uice or otherwise but it is spread over all the kingdome: yea they gather notes, and take copies of all the priuy seales and warrants that his Maiesty hath given for the money for the Scots, that they may shew them in Parliament. But of his Maiesties gifts to the English, there is no bruite though they may be tenne times as much as the Scots. And yet my good Lord, howsoeuer they be thus answered that to them sue for money out of the Exchequer, it is due to them for 10 or 12&punc; or 20 in the hundred, abated according to their quali|ties that sue, they are alwaies furnished. For conclusion, if it would please God to put into the Kings heart to make their assignations, it would saue him many a pound, and gaine him many a prayer, and a great deale of loue, for it grieueth every honest mans heart to see the abu~dance which euen the petty officers in the Exchequer, and others gather both from the king and subiect, and to see a world of poore men runne af|ter the King for their ordinary wages.</P>

Betweene the fifteenth yeare and twentith yeare, hee had two aydes giuen him in the Par|liaments of VVinchester and VVestminster: and this later was given to furnish the Kings iourney into Ireland to esta|blish that estate which was greatly shaken since the death of

<P>That by your fauour, was the Kings sanity: for great armies do rather devour themselues then destroy enimies. Such an army, (whereof the fourth part would haue conque|red all Ireland) was in respect of Ireland such an army as <HI>Xerxes</HI> led into Greece in this twentith yeare, wherein hee had a tenth of the Cleargy, was the great conspiracy of the Kings vnkle, the Duke of Glocester, and of Moubrey, Arun|dell, Nottingham, and Warwick, the Archbishop of Canter|bury and the Abbotte of VVestminster, and others who in the 21^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters"> yeare of the King were all redeemed by parliament. &amp; what thinkes your Lordship, was not this assembly of the 3 states for the kings estate, wherein hee so prevailed, that hee not onely overthrew those popular Lords, but besides (the English Chronicle sayth, the king so wrought and brought things about, that hee obtained the power of both houses to be graunted to certaine persons&punc; to 15 Noblemen and Gentl|men, or to seauen of them.</P>

<P>My good Lord, if your Lordship will pardon mee, I am of opinion that those Parliaments wherein the kings of this land haue satisfied the people, as they haue beene euer prosperous, so where the king hath restrained the house, the contrary hath happened, for the K^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> atchiuements in this parliament, were the ready preparations to his ruine.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true my Lord in some particulars, as euen at this time the Duke of Glocester was made away at Callice by strong hand, without any lawfull triall: for hee was a man so beloued of the people and so allied, hauing the Dukes of Lancaster, and Yorke his brethren, the Duke of Aumarle, and the Duke of Hereford his Nephewes, the great Earles of Arundell and VVarwicke, with diuerse other of his part in the conspiracy, as the King durst not trie him according to the law: for at the tryall of Arundell and VVarwicke, the king was forced to entertaine a petty army about him. And though the Duke was greatly lamented, yet it cannot be denyed but that he was then a traytor to the King. And was it not so my Lord with the Duke of Guise: your Lord|ship doth remember the spurgald proverbe, that <HI>necessitie hath no law:</HI> and my good Lord, it is the practice of doing wrong, and of generall wrongs done, that brings danger, and not where kings are prest in this or that particular, for there is great difference betweene naturall cruelty and ac|cidentall. And therefore it was <HI>Machiauels</HI> advice, that <HI>all that a king did in that kind, he shall do at once, and by his mercies afterwards make the world know that his cruelty was not affected.</HI> And my Lord take this for a generall rule, that the immortall policy of a state cannot admit any law or pri|uiledge whatsoeuer, but in some particular or other, the same is necessarily broken, yea in an <HI>Aristocratia</HI> or popular estate, which vaunts so much of equality and common right, more outrage hath beene committed then in any Christian Monarchy.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Lord, the Parliament which you say dis|putes the Kings prerogatiue, did quite contrary, and destroy|ed the kings charter and pardon formerly giuen to Arundell. And my good Lord, do you remember, that at the Parlia|ment that wrought wonders, when these Lords compoun|ded that parliament, as the King did this, they were so mer|cilesse towards all, that they thought their enemies, as the Earle of Arundell most insolently suffered the Qu: to kneele vnto him three houres for the sauing of one of her servants, and that scorne of his <HI>manebat alto mente repostum.</HI> And to say the truth, it is more barbarous &amp; vnpardonable then any act that ever hee did to permit the wife of his Soueraigne to
<PB N="44" REF="27" MS="y">
kneele to him being the Kings vassaile. For if he had saued the Lords seruant freely at her first request, as it is like e|nough that the Qu: would also haue saued him, <HI>Miseris suc|currens paria obtinebis aliquando.</HI> For your Lordship sees that the Earle of Warwicke who was as farre in the treason as any of the rest, was pardoned. It was also at this parlia|ment that the Duke of Hereford accused <HI>Mowbray</HI> Duke of Norfolke, and that the Duke of Hereford, sonne to the Duke of Lancaster, was banished to the Kings confusion, as your Lordship well knowes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it well, and God knowes that the K. had then a silly and weake Counsell about him, that perswaded him to banish a Prince of the blood, a most valiant man, and the best beloued of the people in generall of any man liuing, especially considering that the K. gaue every day more then other offence to his subiects. For besides that he fined the in|habitants that assisted the Lords in his Minority of the 17 shires) which offence he had long before pardoned, his blank Charters, &amp; letting the Realme to farme to meane persons, by whom he was wholly advised, increased the peoples ha|tred towards the present gouernment.</P>

<PB N="45" REF="27" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true my Lord, but it grieues the subiect to pay custome to the subject, for what mighty men are those Far|mers become, and if those Farmers get many thousands eve|ry yeare, as the world knowes they doe, why should they not now (being men of infinite wealth) declare vnto the K. vpon oath, what they haue gained, and henceforth become the Kings collectors of his custome, did not Queene <HI>Eliza|beth,</HI> who was reputed both a wise and just Princesse, after shee had brought <HI>Customer Smith</HI> from 14000^l a yeare to 42000^l a yeare, made him lay downe a recompence for that which hee had gotten? And if these Farmers doe giue no recompence, let them yet present the King with the trueth of their receivings and profits. But my Lord for conclusion, after <HI>Bollingbrooke</HI> arriuing in <HI>England</HI> with a small troope: Notwithstanding the King at his landing out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> had a sufficient and willing army: yet hee wanting courage to defend his right, gaue leaue to all his souldiers to depart, &amp; put himselfe into his hands that cast him into his graue.</P>

<P>Aswell may your Lordship say hee was knock't in the head by Parliament, for your Lordship knowes, that if King <HI>Richard</HI> had ever escaped out of their fingers, that de|posed him, the next Parliament would haue made all the de|posers traytors and rebels, and that iustly. In which Parlia|me~t, or rather vnlawful assembly, there appeared but one ho|nest man, to wit, the B. of <HI>Carliel,</HI> who scorned his life &amp; e|state, in respect of right &amp; his allegia~ce, &amp; defe~ded the right of his Soveraigne Lo: against the K. elect &amp; his partakers.</P>

<P>Hee had a 15^t^h of the Commons, and a tenth, and a halfe of the Clergy, and withall, all pensions graunted by king <HI>Edward,</HI> and king <HI>Richard</HI> were made voide.

<P>What thinke you of that, Sir? would it not haue beene a dishonour to the king? and would not his Successors haue done the like to those that the king had advanced?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot answere your Lordship, but by distin|guishing&punc; for where the kings had given land for services, and had not beene over-reached in his gifts, there it had bin a dishonour to the king, to haue made voide the graunts of his predecessors, or his graunts, but all those graunts of the kinges, wherein they were deceived, the very custome and policy of <HI>England</HI> makes them voyde at this day.</P>

<P>And I beleeue as your Lordship doth, but we spake e're-while of those that disswaded the King fro~ calling it a Parliament: And your Lordship asked mee the reason, why any man should disswade it, or feare it, to which, this place giues me an opportunity to make your Lordship an answer, for though his Majestle will of himself never question those graunts, yet when the Commons shall make humble petiti|on to the King in Parliament, that it will please his Majestie to assist them in his reliefe, with that which ought to be his owne, which, if it will please his Majestie to yeeld vnto, the house will most willingly furnish and supply the rest, with what grace can his Majestie deny that honest suite of theirs, the like hauing beene done in many Kinges times before? This proceeding, my good Lord, may perchance proue all your phrases of the Kings honour, false <HI>English.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But this cannot concerne many, &amp; for my self, I am sure it concernes me little.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true my Lord, and there are not many that disswade his Majestie from a Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But they are great ones, a fewe of which will serue the turne well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my Lord, bee they neuer so great (as great as Gyants) yet if they disswade the King from his ready and assured way of his subsistence, they must devise how the <HI>K.</HI> may be else-where supplied, for they otherwise runne into a dangerous fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold you contented Sir, the King needes no great disswasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, learne of me, that there is none of you all, that can pierce the King. It is an essentiall property of a man truely wise, not to open all the boxes of his bosome, even to those that are neerest and deerest vnto him, for when a man is discovered to the very bottome, he is after the lesse estee|med. I dare vndertake, that when your Lordship hath served the King twice twelue yeares more, you will finde, that his
<PB N="48" REF="29" MS="y">
Majestie hath reserved somewhat beyond all your capaci|ties, his Majestie hath great reason to put off the Parliament, as his last refuge, and in the meane time, to make triall of all your loues to serue him, for his Majestie hath had good ex|perience, how well you can serue your selues: But when the King finds, that the building of your owne fortunes and fa|ctions, hath beene the diligent studies, and the service of his Majestie, but the exercises of your leisures: Hee may then perchance cast himself vpon the general loue of his people, of which (I trust) hee shall never bee deceiued, and leaue as many of your Lordships as haue pilfered from the Crowne, to their examination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, I take no great pleasure in this dispute, goe on I pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that Kinges 5^t^h yeare, hee had also a subsedy, which he got by holding the house together from Easter to Christmas, and would not suffer them to depart. He had also a subsedie in his ninth yeare. In his eleventh yeare the Com|mons did againe presse the king to take all the temporalities of the Church-men into his hands, which they proved suf|ficient to maintaine 150 Earles, 1500 knights, and 6400 Es|quiers, with a hundred hospitals, but they not prevayling, gaue the King a subsedy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hen.</HI> 5.</NOTE>As for the notorious Prince, <HI>Henry</HI> the fift, I finde, that he had given him in his second yeare 300000 markes, and after that two other subsedies, one in his fifth yeare, another in his ninth, without any disputes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hen.</HI> 6.</NOTE>In the time of his successour <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt, there where not many subsedies. In his third yeare, he had a subsedy of a Tunnage and Poundage. And here (saith <HI>Iohn Stom</HI>) began those payments, which wee call customes, because the pay|ment was continued, whereas before that time it was gran|ted but for a yeare, two, or three, according to the Kings oc|casions. Hee had also an ayde and gathering of money in his fourth yeare, and the like in his tenth yeare, and in his thir|teenth yere a 15^th. He had also a fifteenth for the conveying
<PB N="49" REF="29" MS="y">
of the Queene out of <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England.</HI> In the twenty eight yeare of that King was the acte of Resumption of all honours, townes, castles, Signieuries, villages, Manors, lands, tenements, rents, reversions, fees, &amp;c. But because the wages of the Kings seruants, were by the strictnes of the acte also restrained, this acte of Resumption was expounded in the Parliament at <HI>Reading</HI> the 31^t^h yeare of the Kings reigne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceiue that those acts of Resumption were ordinary in former times; for King <HI>Stephen</HI> resumed the lands, which in former times hee had giuen to make friends during the Ciuill warres. And <HI>Henry</HI> the second resumed all (without exception) which King <HI>Stephen</HI> had not resu|med; for although King <HI>Stephen</HI> tooke backe a great deale, yet hee suffered his trustiest seruants to enjoye his gift.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes my Lord, &amp; in after times also; for this was not the last, nor shall be the last, I hope. And judge you my Lord, whether the Parliaments doe not only serue the King, whatsoeuer is said to the contrary; for as all King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6, gifts &amp; graunts were made voide by the Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> when he was in possession of the kingdome by Parliament. So in the time of <HI>K. H.</HI> when <HI>K. Edw:</HI> was beaten out again, the Parliament of <HI>Westminster</HI> made all his acts voyde, made him &amp; all his followers traytors, &amp; gaue the King many of their heads &amp; lands. The Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> do alwaies serue the King in possession. It seru'd <HI>Rich.</HI> the second to con|demne the popular Lords. It seru'd <HI>Bollingbrooke</HI> to depose <HI>Rich.</HI> When <HI>Edw.</HI> the 4. had the Scepter, it made them all beggars that had followed <HI>H.</HI> the 6. And it did the like for <HI>H.</HI> when <HI>Edw.</HI> was driuen out. The Parliaments are as the friendship of this world is, which alwayes followeth pros|perity. For <HI>K. Edw.</HI> the 4: after that hee was possessed of the Crown, he had in his 13 yeare a subsedy freely giuen him: &amp; in the yeare following hee tooke a benevolence through <HI>England,</HI> which arbitrary taking fro~ the people, seru'd that ambitious traytor the Duke of Bucks. After the Kings death was a plausible argument to perswade the multitude,
<PB N="50" REF="30" MS="y">
that they should not permit (saith Sir <HI>Thomas Moore</HI>) his line to raigne any longer vpon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, what say you to the Parliament of <HI>Richard</HI> the third his time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I finde but one, and therein he made diuerse good Lawes. For K. <HI>Henry</HI> the seuenth in the beginning of his third yeare hee had by Parliament an ayde granted vnto him, to|wards the reliefe of the Duke of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> then assailed by the <HI>French</HI> King. And although the King did not enter into the warre, but by the advice of the three estates, who did willingly contribute: Yet those Northerne men which loued <HI>Richard</HI> the third, raised rebellion vnder colour of the mony impos'd, &amp; murthered the Earle of <HI>Northumberland</HI> whom the King employed in that Collection. By which your Lordship sees, that it hath not beene for taxes and impositi|ons alone, that the ill disposed haue taken Armes&punc; but euen for those payments which haue beene appoynted by Parlia|ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what became of those Rebels?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were fairely hang'd, and the mony levied notwithstanding, in the Kings first yeare he gathered a mar|vailous great masse of mony, by a benevolence, taking pat|terne by this kind of levie from <HI>Edw.</HI> 4^t^h. But the King cau|sed it first to be moued in Parliament where it was allowed, because the poorer sort were therein spared. Yet it is true that the king vsed some arte, for in his Letters hee declared that hee would measure euery mans affections by his gifts. In the thirteenth yeare hee had also a subsedy, whereupon the Cornish men tooke Armes, as the Northerne men of the Bishoppricke had done in the third yeare of the King.</P>

<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is without example, that euer the people haue rebelled for any thing granted by Parliament, saue in this kings dayes.</P>

<PB N="51" REF="30" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I pray you what say they now of the new impositions lately laide by the Kings Maiesty? doe they say that they are justly or injustly laide?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>To impose vpon all things brought into the Kingdome is very auncient: which imposing when it hath beene continued a certaine time, is then called Customes, be|cause the subjects are accustomed to pay it, &amp; yet the great taxe vpon wine is still called Impost, because it was imposed after the ordinary rate of payment, had lasted many yeares. But we doe now a dayes vnderstand those things to bee im|positions, which are raised by the commaund of Princes, without the aduice of the common-wealth, though (as I take it) much of that which is now called custome, was at the first imposed by Prerogatiue royall: Now whether it be time or consent that makes them just, I cannot define, were they just because new, and not justified yet by time, or vn|just because they want a generall consent: yet is this rule of <HI>Aristotle</HI> verified in respect of his Majestie: <HI>Minus timent homines iniustum pati &agrave; principe quem cultorem dei putant.</HI> Yea my Lord, they are also the more willingly borne, be|cause all the world knowes they are no new Invention of the Kings. And if those that advised his Maiestie to impose them, had raised his lands (as it was offered them) to 20000^l more then it was, and his wards to asmuch as aforesaid, they had done him farre more acceptable seruice. But they had their own ends in refusing the one, and accepting the other. If the land had beene raised, they could not haue selected the best of it for themselues: If the impositions had not been laide, some of them could not haue their silkes, others pee|ces in farme, which indeed grieued the subiect tenne times more then that which his Maiestie enjoyeth. But cer|tainly they made a great advantage that were the advi|sers, for if any tumult had followed his Maiesty, ready way had beene to haue deliuered them ouer to the people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But thinke you that the King would haue de|liuered them if any troubles had followed?</P>

<PB N="52" REF="31" MS="y">

<P>I know not my Lord, it was <HI>Machiavels</HI> coun|sell to <HI>Caesar Borgia</HI> to doe it, and <HI>K. H.</HI> the 8 deliuered vp <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley,</HI> yea the same King, when the great Car|dinall <HI>Woolsey,</HI> who gouerned the King and all his estate, had (by requiring the sixt part of euery mans goods for the King) raised a rebellion, the King I say disavowed him ab|solutely, that had not the Dukes of <HI>Norfolke</HI> and <HI>Suffolke</HI> appeased the people, the Cardinall had sung no more Masse: for these are the words of our Story: The King then came to <HI>Westminster</HI> to the Cardinals palace, and assembled there a great Councell, in which he protested, that <HI>his minde was ne|uer to aske any thing of his Commons which might sound to the breach of his Lawes.</HI> Wherefore hee then willed them to know by whose meanes they were so strictly giuen foorth.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But good Sir, you blanch my question, and answere mee by examples. I aske you whether or no in any such tumult, the people pretending against any one or two great Officers, the King should deliuer them, or defend them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Lord, the people haue not stayde for the kings deliuery, neither in <HI>England,</HI> nor in <HI>France</HI>: Your Lordship knowes how the Chauncellour, Treasurer, and Chiefe Iustice, with many others at seuerall times haue bin vsed by the Rebels: And the Marshals, Constables, and Trea|surers in <HI>France,</HI> haue beene cut in pieces in <HI>Charles</HI> the sixt his time. Now to your Lordships question, I say that where any man shall giue a King perilous advice, as may either cause a rebellion, or draw the peoples loue from the King. I say, that a King shalbe advised to banish him: But if the King doe absolutely commaund his seruant to doe any thing dis|pleasing to the Common-wealth, and to his own peril, there is the King bound in honour to defend him. But my good Lord for conclusion, there is no man in <HI>England</HI> that will lay
<PB N="53" REF="31" MS="y">
any invention either grieuous or against law vpon the Kings Maiesty: And therefore your Lordships must share it amongst you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I had no hand in it, (I thinke) <HI>In|gram</HI> was he that propounded it to the Treasurer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas my good Lord, euery poore wayter in the Custome-house, or euery promoter might haue done it, there is no invention in these things. To lay impositions, and sell the Kings lands, are poore and common devices. It is true that <HI>Ingram</HI> and his fellowes are odious men, and there|fore his Maiestie pleas'd the people greatly to put him from the Coffership. It is better for a Prince to vse such a kinde of men, then to countenance them, hang-men are necessary in a Commonwealth: yet in the Nether-lands, none but a hangmans sonne will marry a hang-mans daughter. Now my Lord, the last gathering which <HI>Henry</HI> the seuenth made, was in his twentieth yeare, wherein hee had another bene|volence both of the Cleargy and Laity, a part of which ta|ken of the poorer sort, hee ordained by his Testament that it should bee restored. And for King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, al|though hee was left in a most plentifull estate, yet he won|derfully prest his people with great payments; for in the beginning of his time it was infinite that hee spent in Mas|king and Tilting, Banquetting, and other vanities, before hee was entered into the most consuming expence of the most fond and fruitlesse warre that euer King vndertooke. In his fourth yeare hee had one of the greatest subsedies that euer was granted; for besides two fifteenes and two dismes, hee vsed <HI>Dauids</HI> Lawe of Capitation or head-money, and had of euery Duke ten markes, of euery Earle fiue pounds, of eue|ry Lord foure pounds, of euery Knight foure markes, &amp; e|uery man rated at 8^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> in goods, 4 markes, and so after the rate: yea euery man that was valued but at 40 paide 12^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">, and e|uery man and woman aboue 15 yeares 4^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">. Hee had also in his sixt yeare diuers subsedies granted him. In his four|teenth there was a tenth demaunded of euery mans goods, but it was moderated. In the Parliament following,
<PB N="54" REF="32" MS="y">
the Clergie gaue the King the halfe of their spirituall liuings for one yeare, &amp; of the Laity there was demanded 800000', which could not be levied in England, but it was a marvei|lous great gift that the king had giuen him at that time. In the Kings seuenteenth yeare was the Rebellion before spo|ken of, wherein King disavowed the Cardinall. In his seuenteenth yeare hee had the tenth and fifteenth giuen by Parliament, which were before that time paide to the Pope. And before that also, the monyes that the King bor|rowed in his fifteenth yeare were forgiuen him by Parlia|ment in his seuenteenth yeare.

<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it were but time lost to speake of the lat|ter, and by those that are alreadie remembred, we may iudge of the rest, for those of the greatest importance are pub|lique. But I pray you deale freely with mee, what you thinke would bee done for his Maiestie, if hee should call a Parliament at this time, or what would bee required at his Maiesties hands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first thing that would be required, would be the same that vvas required by the Commons in the thir|tenth yeare of <HI>H.</HI> the 8: (to wit) that if any man of the com|mons house should speake more largely, then of duety hee ought to doe, all such offences to be pardoned, and that to be of record.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So might euery Companion speake of the King what they list.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my Lord, the reuerence vvhich a Vassall ovyeth to his Soueraigne, is alvvaies intended for euery speech, howsoeuer it must import the good of the King, and his estate, and so long it may bee easily pardoned, othervvise not; for in Queene <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, vvho gaue freedome of speech in all Parliaments, vvhen <HI>Wentworth</HI> made those
<PB N="56" REF="33" MS="y">
motions, that were but supposed dangerous to the Queenes estate, he was imprisoned in the Towre, notwithstanding the priviledge of the house, and there died.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you to the <HI>Scicilian vespers</HI> remem|bred in the last Parliament?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, hee repented him heartily that vsed that speech, and indeede besides that, it was seditious, this ex|ample held not: The <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Scicily</HI> vsurped that King|dome, they kept neither law nor faith, they tooke away the inheritance of the Inhabitants, they tooke from them their wiues, and rauished their daughters, committing all other insolencies that could bee imagined. The Kings Maiesty is the Naturall Lord of <HI>England,</HI> his Vassals of <HI>Scotland</HI> o|bey the English Lawes, if they breake them, they are puni|shed without respect. Yea his Maiesty put one of his Ba|rons to a shamefull death, for being consenting onely to the death of a Common Fencer: And which of these euer did or durst commit any outrage in <HI>England,</HI> but to say the trueth, the opinion of packing the last, was the cause of the conten|tion and disorder that happened.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why sir? doe you not think it best to compound a Parliament of the Kings seruaunts and others, that shall in all obey the kings desires?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainely no, for it hath neuer succeeded well, neither on the kings part, nor on the subiects, as by the Par|liament before-remembred your Lordshippe may gather, for from such a composition doe arise all jealousies, and all contentions. It was practized in elder times, to the great trouble of the kingdome, and to the losse and ruine of ma|ny. It was of latter time vsed by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, but euery way to his disadvantage. When the King leaues himselfe to his people, they assure themselues that they are trusted and beloued of their king, and there was neuer any assembly so barbarous, as not to aunswere the loue and trust of their King. <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt when his estate was in effect vtterly ouerthrowne, &amp; vtterly impouerished at
<PB N="57" REF="33" MS="y">
the humble request of his Treasurer made the same knowne to the House, or otherwise, vsing the Treasurers owne words, <HI>Hee humbly desired the King to take his staffe, that hee might saue his wardship.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you know, they will presently bee in hand with those impositions, which the King hath laid by his owne royall prerogatiue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perchance not my Lord; but rather with those im|positions that haue beene by some of your Lordships laide vpon the King, which did not some of your Lordships feare more than you doe the impositions laid vpon the Subjects, you would neuer disswade his Majestie from a Parliament: For no man doubted, but that his Majestie was advised to lay those impositions by his Councell; and for particular things on which they were laid, the aduice came from pet|ty fellowes (though now great ones) belonging to the Cu|stome-house. Now my Lord, what prejudice hath his Ma|jestie (his revenue beeing kept vp) if the impositions that were laid by the aduice of a few, be in Parliament laid by the generall Councell of the kingdome, which takes off all grud|ging and complaint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea Sir, but that which is done by the King, with the aduice of his priuate or priuy Councell, is done by the Kings absolute power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And by whose power is it done in Parliament, but by the Kinges absolute power? mistake it not my Lord: The 3 estates doe but advise, as the priuy Councel doth, which ad|vice if the king embrace, it becomes the kings own acte in the one, &amp; the kings law in the other, for without the kings acceptation, both the publicke &amp; priuate aduices bee but as empty egge-shels; and what doth his Majestie loose if some of those things, which concerns the poorer sort be made free again, &amp; the reuenue kept vp vpo~ that which is superfluous? <HI>Is</HI> it a losse to the <HI>K.</HI> to be beloued of the Commons? if it be revenue which the <HI>K.</HI> seekes, is it not better to take it of those that laugh, than of those that crie? Yea if all bee con|tent to pay vpon a moderation and chaunge of the Species:
<PB N="58" REF="34" MS="y">
Is it more honourable and more safe for the King, that the Subject pay by perswasion, then to haue them constrayned? If they be contented to whip themselues for the King, were it not better to giue them their rod into their owne hands, than to commit them to the executioner? Certainly it is farre more happy for a Soveraigne Prince, that a Subject open his purse willingly, than that the same bee opened by violence. Besides that when impositions are laid by Parliament, they are gathered by the authority of the lawe, which (as afore|said) rejecteth all complaints, and stoppeth every mutinous mouth: It shall ever be my praier, that the King embrace the Councell of honour and safety, &amp; let other Princes embrace that of force.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But good Sir, it is his <HI>Prerogatiue</HI> which the K. stands vpon, and it is the <HI>Prerogatiue</HI> of the kings, that the Parliaments doe all diminish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your Lordship would pardon mee, I would say then, that your Lordships objection against Parliaments is ridiculous. In former Parliaments three thinges haue beene supposed dishonour of the King. The first, that the Subjects haue conditioned with the King, when the King hath needed them, to haue the great Charter confirmed: the second, that the Estates haue made Treasurers for the necessary and pro|fitable disbursing of those summes by them given, to the end, that the kinges, to whom they were giuen, should ex|pend them for their owne defence, &amp; for the defence of the common-wealth: The third, that these haue prest the King to discharge some great Officers of the Crowne, and to e|lect others. As touching the first my Lord, I would faine learne what disadvantage the Kings of this Land haue had by confirming the great Charter, the breach of which haue ser|ved onely men of your Lordships ranke, to assist their owne passions, and to punish and imprison at their owne discreti|on the Kings poore Subjects. Concerning their private ha|tred, with the colour of the Kings service, for the Kings Ma|jestie takes no mans inheritance (as I haue said before) nor
<PB N="59" REF="34" MS="y">
any mans life, but by the Law of the land, according to the Charter. Neither doth his Majestie imprison any man, (mat|ter of practice, which concernes the preservation of his e|state excepted) but by the law of the land. And yet hee vseth his prerogatiue as all the Kings of <HI>England</HI> haue ever vsed it: for the supreame reason cause to practise many thinges without the aduice of the law. As in insurrections and rebel|lions, it vseth the marshall, and not the common law, with|out any breach of the Charter, the intent of the Charter co~|sidered truely. Neither hath any Subject made complaint, or beene grieued, in that the Kings of this land, for their own safties, and preservation of their estates, haue vsed their Pre|rogatiues, the great Ensigne, on which there is written <HI>soli Deo.</HI> And my good Lord, was not <HI>Buckingham</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Byron</HI> in <HI>France</HI> condemned, their Peeres vncall'd? And withall, was not <HI>Byron</HI> vtterly (contrary to the customes &amp; priviledges of the <HI>French</HI>) denyed an advocate to assist his defence? for where lawes forecast cannot prouide remedies for future daungers, Princes are forced to assist themselues by their <HI>prerogatiues.</HI> But that which hath beene ever grie|vous, and the cause of many troubles, very dangerous is, that your Lordships abusing the reasons of state, doe punish and imprison the Kings Subiects at your pleasure. It is you my Lords, that when Subjects haue sometimes neede of the Kings prerogatiue, doe then vse the strength of the law, and when they require the lawe, you afflict them with the pre|rogatiue, and tread the great Charter (which hath beene con|firmed by 16. actes of Parliament) vnder your feete, as a torne parchment or wast paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Sir, which of vs doe in this sort breake the great Charter? perchance you meane, that we haue adui|sed the King to lay the new impositions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my Lord: there is nothing in the great Char|ter against impositions: and besides that, necessity doth per|swade them. And if necessity doe in somewhat excuse a pri|vate man <HI>a fortiori,</HI> it may then excuse a Prince. Againe, the
<PB N="60" REF="35" MS="y">
Kinges Majestie hath profit and increase of revenue by the impositions. But there are of your Lordships (contrary to the direct letter of the Charter) that imprison the Kinges Subjects, and deny them the benefit of the law, to the Kings disprofit. And what do you otherwise thereby (if the impo|sitions be in any sort grievous) but <HI>Renovare dolores</HI>? and withall digge out of the dust the long-buried memory of the Subjects former intentions with their Kings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What meane you by that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell your Lordshippe when I dare, in the meane time it is enough for mee, to put your Lordship in minde, that all the estates in the world, in the offence of the people, haue either had profit or necessity to perswade them to adventure it, of which, if neither bee vrgent, and yet the Subject exceedingly grieved, your Lordship may conje|cture, that the House will bee humble suitors for a redresse. And if it bee a Maxime in policie to please the people in all thinges indifferent, and neuer suffer them to bee beaten, but for the Kinges benefit, (for there are no blowes forgotten with the smart but those) then I say to make them vassals to vassals, is but to batter downe those mastering buildings, erected by King <HI>Henry</HI> the seaventh, and fortified by his Sonne, by which the people and Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> were brought to depend vpon the King alone. Yea my good Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Q. E.</HI></NOTE> our late deare Soveraigne kept them vp, and to their advantage, as well repaired as ever Prince did, <HI>De|fend mee, and spend me,</HI> saith the <HI>Irish</HI> churle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you thinke that this violent breach of the Charter will be the cause of seeking the confirmation of it in the next Parliament, which otherwise could neuer haue bin moued.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knowe not my good Lord, perchance not, for if the House presse the King to graunt vnto them all that is theirs by the lawe, they cannot (in justice) refuse the King all that is his by the lawe. And where will bee the issue of such a contention? I dare not divine, but sure I am
<PB N="61" REF="35">
that it will tend to the preiudice both of the K: and subiect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVN:</SPEAKER>
<P>If they dispute not their owne liberties; why should they then dispute the Kings liberties, which wee call his prerogatiue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>Among so many &amp; so diverse spirits, no man can fore|tell what may be propounded, but howsoeuer if, the matter be not slightly handled on the Kings behalfe, these disputes will soone dissolue, for the King hath so little neede of his prerogatiue, and so great advantage by the lawes, as the feare of imparing the one, to wit, the prerogatiue, is so impossible, and the burthen of the other (to wit) the lawe so waighty, as but by a branch of the Kings prerogatiue, namely of his re|mission and pardon, the subiect is no way able to vndergoe it. This my Lord is no matter of flourish that I haue said, but it is the truth, and vnanswerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to execute the lawes very severely, would be very grievous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my Lord, are the Lawes grievous which our selues haue required of our Kings? and are the prerogatiues also which our Kings haue reserued to themselues also grie|uous? how ca~ such a people then be well pleased? And if your Lordship confesse that the lawes giue too much, why does your Lordship vrge the prerogatiue that giues more? Nay <HI>I</HI> will be bold to say it, that except the Lawes were better ob|serued, the prerogatiue of a religious Prince hath manifold lesse perils then the letter of the Lawe hath. Now my Lord, for the second &amp; third, to wit, for the appointing of Treasu|rers, and remouing of Counsellers, our Kings haue evermore laught them to scorne that haue prest either of these, &amp; after the Parliament dissolued, tooke the money of the Treasurers of the Parliament, and recalled &amp; restored the officers dis|charged, or else they haue bin contented, that so me such per|sons should be remoued at the request of the whole king|dome, which they themselues out of their noble natures, would not seeme willing to remoue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, would you notwithstanding all these arguments advise his Maiesty to call a Parlament?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="62" REF="36">
<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>It belongs to your Lordships who enioy the Kings favour, &amp; are chosen for your able wisdome to advise the K. It were a strange boldnesse in a poore and priuate person, to advise Kings, attended with so vnderstanding a Councell. But belike your Lordships haue conceiued some other way, how money may be gotten otherwise. If any trouble should happen, your Lordship knowes, that then there were no|thing so daungerous for a King, as to be without money: a Parliament cannot assemble in haste, but present dangers re|quire hasty remedies. It wil be no time then to discontent the subjects by vsing any vnordinary wayes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, all this notwithstanding wee dare not advise the king to call a parliament, for if it should succeede ill, wee that advise, should fall into the kings disgrace. And if the king be driuen into any extremity, wee can say to the K. that because we found it extreamely vnpleasing to his Maie|stie to heare of a Parliament, we thought it no good manners to make such a motion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, to the first let me tell you, that there was never any iust Prince that hath taken any advantage of the successe of Councels, which haue beene founded on reason. To feare that, were to feare the losse of the bell, more then the losse of the steeple, and were also the way to beate all men from the studies of the Kings seruice. But for the second, where you say you can excuse your selues vpon the Kinges owne protesting against a parliament, the king vpon better consideration may encounter that finenesse of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS:</SPEAKER>
<P>How I pray you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>Even by declaring himselfe to be indifferent, by cal|ling your Lordships together, and by delivering vnto you, that he heares how his loving subiects in generall are willing to supply him, if it please him to call a Parliament, for that was the common answere to all the Sheriffes in England, when the late benevolence was commaunded. In which re|spect, and because you come short in all your proiects, and because it is a thing most daungerous for a King to be with|out treasure, he requires such of you, as either mislike, or ra|ther
<PB N="63" REF="36">
feare a parliament, to set downe your reasons in writing, which you either misliked, or feared it. And such as wish and desire it, to set downe answeres to your obiections: And so shall the King prevent the calling or not calling on his Maiesty, as some of your great Councellers haue done in ma|ny other things shrinking vp their shoulders, and saying, the K. will haue it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COVNS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wel Sir, it growes late, and I will bid you fare|well, only you shall take well with you this advice of mine, thst in all that you haue said against our greatest, those men in the end shalbe your Iudges in their owne cause, you that trouble your selfe with reformation, are like to be well re|warded: for hereof you may assure your selfe, that wee will never allow of any invention how profitable soeuer, vnlesse it proceede, or seeme to proceede from our&punc;selues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST:</SPEAKER>
<P>If then my Lord, wee may presume to say that Prin|ces may be vnhappy in any thing, certainly they are vnhappy in nothing more then in suffering themselues to be so inclo|sed. Againe, if we may beleeu <HI>Pliny,</HI> who tels vs, that t'is an ill signe of prosperity in any kingdome or state, where such as deserue well, find no other recompence then the content|ment of their owne consciences, a farre worse signe is it, where the justly accused shall take revenge of the just accu|ser. But my good Lord, there is this hope remaining, that se|eing he hath beene abused by them he trusted most, hee will not for the future dishonour of his iudgment (so well infor|med by his owne experience) as to expose such of his vas|sals (as haue had no other motiues to serue him, then simply the loue of his person and his estate) to their revenge, who haue only beene moued by the loue of their owne fortunes, and their glory.</P>

<P>No my Lord, neither haue all beene trusted, neither doth the world accuse all, but beleeue, that there be among your Lordships very just and worthy men, aswell of the No|bility as others, but those though most honoured in the

Common-wealth, yet haue they not beene most imployed: your Lordship knowes it well enough, that 3 or 4 of your Lordships haue thought your hands strong enough to beare vp alone the weightiest affaires in the Common-wealth, and strong enough, all the land haue found them to beate downe whom they pleased.</P>

<P>There needes no perspectiue glasse to discerne it, for neither in the treaties of peace and warre, in matters of revenue, and matters of trade, any thing hath happened ei|ther of loue or of judgment.

<P>It is all one, your papers can neither answere nor reply, we can. Besides you tell the King no newes in delive|ring these complaints, for hee knowes as much as can be told him.</P>

<P>For the first my Lord, whereas he hath once the reasons of things deliuered him, your Lordships shall neede to be well advised, in their answeres there is no sophistrie wil serue the turne, where the Iudge, &amp; the vndersta~ding are both supreame. For the 2^d, to say that his Maiesty knowes, &amp; cares not, that my Lord were but to despaire all his faith|full subiects. But by your fauour my Lord, wee see it is con|trary, wee find now that there is no such singular power as there hath beene, justice is described with a ballance in her hand, holding it even and it hangs as even now as ever it did in any kings dayes, for singular authority begets but generall oppression.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>IVST.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea my Lord, I know it well, that malice hath a lon|ger life, than either loue or thankfulnesse hath, for as we al|waies take more care to put off paine, than to enjoy plea|sure, because the one hath no intermission, &amp; with the other we are often satisfied, so it is in the smart of injury and the memory of good turnes: <HI>Wrongs are written in marble: Benefits are (sometimes) acknowledged, rarely requited.</HI> But my Lord, wee shall doe the K. great wrong, to judge him by common rules, or ordinary examples, for seeing his Majesty hath greatly enriched and advanced those that haue but pre|tended his service, no man needes to doubt of his goodnesse towards those that shal performe any thing worthy reward. Nay, the not taking knowledge of those of his owne vassals that haue done him wrong, is more to be lamented, than the relinquishing of those that doe him right, is to be suspected. I am therefore, my good Lo: held to my resolutio~ by these a, besides the former. The 1, that God would neuer haue blest him with so many yeres, &amp; in so many actio~s, yea in all his actions, had he paid his honest servants with evill for good.
