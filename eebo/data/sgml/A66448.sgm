<P>THE Most High hath adorned you with an <HI>High

<P>Touching this most <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> and other heavenly Points
in difference between the <HI>Protestants</HI> and the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I
present your royal eye with a <HI>Lantskip</HI> of a <HI>Battle</HI> fought
this last Summer in your Majestyes <HI>New-England,</HI> between
some of the eminentest of the <HI>Quakers</HI> and my self, three

<P><PB REF="3">
I am humbly bold to present it to your <HI>Royal Hand,</HI></P>
<P>1. That your own precious <HI>Soul</HI> (infinitely more pre|cious
then thousands of <HI>Brittains</HI> or <HI>Worlds</HI> may see the
<HI>Grounds</HI> and <HI>Roots</HI> of these <HI>Protestant Disquisitions.</HI></P>

<HI>Favour</HI> to us &amp;c</P>
<P>3. Because your Majestyes <HI>Name</HI> is often mentioned
and concerned in these <HI>Concertations.</HI></P>
<P>4. Because it was affirmed by some of my Opposites in
publick, that there were scarce any of their <HI>Books</HI> came
forth, but the <HI>King</HI> had one: I thought it some obligation
on me, to present the <HI>Protestant Truth</HI> (thus publickly and
solemnly asserted) more justly then my <HI>Popish</HI> and <HI>Ar|minian
Opposites</HI> to offend your Royal eyes with Smoak out
of the <HI>Deep Pit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gracious Sir,</HI> I know your precious <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Minutes</HI>

therefore hope for one <HI>glance</HI> of your eye upon any more

<P><HI>Charles</HI> the Great was one of the greatest Princes of that

<P>By Gods most wise and righteous Permission, the <HI>Pope</HI>

<HEAD>To the People called Quakers.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends &amp; Country-men:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>1. THe occasion of these <HI>Discourses</HI> you may see in
the first Page: the 14 <HI>Proposals</HI> in the second
Page, and the occasion of the Title in the 34.</P>
<P>2. The truth is (as <HI>Edmund Burroughs,</HI> and
others of you say of your selves) from my Childhood (now
above three-score years) the Father of <HI>Lights</HI> and <HI>Mercies</HI>
toucht my Soul with a love to himself, to his only be|gotten,
the true <HI>Lord Iesus,</HI> to his <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> &amp;c. his
infinite Wisdome hath given me to see the City, Court
and Country, the Schools and Universities of my <HI>Native
Country,</HI> to converse with some <HI>Turks, Iews, Papists,</HI> and
all sorts of <HI>Protestants,</HI> and by Books to know the <HI>Affairs</HI>
and <HI>Religions</HI> of all <HI>Countries,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>3. My Conclusion is, that <HI>be of good chear thy sins are
forgiven thee,</HI> Mat. 9. is one of the joyfullest sounds that
ever came to poor sinful Ears: how to obtain this sound
from the mouth of that Mediatour that spoke it, is the
great dispute beween the <HI>Protestants</HI> and the bloody <HI>Whore
of Rome:</HI> this is also the great point between the true <HI>Pro|testants</HI>
and your selves: as also (in order to this) about
what man is (to the utmost) now by nature, what the true
Lord Jesus Christ is, and all other controversies (discussed
in this Book, not unworthy this your serious weighing (as
<HI>Mary</HI> did) in the hearts and spirits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>4. Bear with me while I say, that as the <HI>Iesuites</HI> pre|tend
to deifie the <HI>Pope,</HI> but it is known, the end is to deifie
themselves under the cloak of the <HI>Popes</HI> Name: so Satan
<PB REF="4">
pretends to exalt and deifie you, under the name of <HI>God,</HI>
and <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. but his end is as <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, to
exalt himself, and fill his hellish Paunch with Souls.</P>
<P>5. I endeavoured, but could not procure a Short-hand
writer, so that I am forced to recollect Transactions from
my Memory, and I believe (as in the holy presence of
God) that I have not failed to present the true substance
of passages without advantage to my self, or disadvantage
to my Opposites.</P>
<P>6. I have used some sharp Scripture Language, but not
(as commonly you do) passionately and unjustly: I some|times
call you <HI>Foxians,</HI> (as <HI>Nicolaitans</HI> from <HI>Nicholas</HI>) be|cause
<HI>G. Fox</HI> hath appeared the greatest Writer, and the
greatest Preacher amongst you, and the most deified that I
can hear of, sure it is that here he subtly run for it: he
ordered that my Letters to our Deputy Governour Cap|tain
<HI>Cranstone</HI> (in which my Proposals to <HI>G. F.</HI> were, should
not be delivered to the Deputy, until <HI>G. F.</HI> was some hours
under sayle, that he might say he never saw my Paper,
though it is as clear as noon-day that he knew all matters
by Copies, Letters and Relations, perfectly many dayes
before his departure.</P>
<P>7. My disadvantage (in our Contests (especially at <HI>New|port</HI>)
were great and many: for though <HI>I. Stubs.</HI> and <HI>I.
Burnet</HI> were more civil and ingenious: yet <HI>W. Edmondson</HI>
was nothing but a bundle of Ignorance, and Boisterousness,
he would speak first end all (though all three were con|stantly
on me at once) no man might speak at all in favour
of my Positions: any might freely speak against them:
they sat in the midst of the Governour &amp; Magistrates (of
their Opinion) and the whole Assembly (of their way) <HI>W.
Edmundson</HI> (though <HI>I. Stubs</HI> twice said in publick, that I had
not inter-interrupted them) yet <HI>W. Edmundson</HI> would fre|quently
and insolently interrupt me: so that I was not only
<PB REF="5">
forced to bear patiently (through Gods only help) but to
suppress my thoughts, which here I have added in some
places. 8. I know that a great weight of your Opinions
and Actings lye upon your believing your selves guided by
the immediate Spirit of God: but I believe that I have
proved that it is no more the holy Spirit of God, that
speaks and acts in you, then it was the true <HI>Samuel</HI> that
spake such heavenly words in the appearance of <HI>Sam.</HI>
Mantle amongst a cloud of other witnesses you shall never
perswade Souls (not bewitched) that the holy spirit of God
would perswade your Women and Maidens to appear in
publick (streets &amp; assemblies) stark naked, &amp;c. of which I
have spoke more particularly in our disputations. 9. It is
hard to perswade a Fox or a Wolf that he is so, &amp;c. or
that he doth Rob or Steal, or Murther; it is hard to per|swade
a man while he dreams that he is in a Dream: yea
though he be a filthy Dreamer as Gods Spirit speaks: In
our Dreams we believe lyes and impossibilities to be true
as that we are many thousand miles of, that we talk with
dead men, &amp;c. that we are at Marriages or Burials and are
Kings and Queens. &amp;c.</P>
<P>10. All that I can hope for (without Gods wonderfull
mercy) is to give my Testimony in my generation: for (as
<HI>Solomon</HI> speaks of the Whore) few or none of you return.
Yet I know Gods foundation is sure he knows who are his
amongst you as amongst other perswasions. I have proved,
and will prove (if God please) that spiritual Pride, that is
Pride about spiritual matters, is the Root and Branch of
your whole Religion, and that the King Eternal, who did
cast out proud Angels out of his Palace, will hardly open
his Gates to proud and scornful Dust and Ashes:</P>

DISPUTE,
This last August 1672 (so called) in the
Colony of Rode-Iland and Providence, Plantations in
N. ENGLAND, between Roger Williams of Provi|dence
(who Challenged Fox by writing (which fol|lowes)
and all his Friends then met on Rode-Iland,
(and G. Fox withdrawing) Iohn
Stubs, Iohn Burniat, and William
Edmundon (three of their ablest Apos|tles)
on the other, that is, (on the
pretended Quakers) Party.</HEAD>
<P>HAving long heard of the great name of
<HI>G. Fox,</HI> (a man cried up by the Peo|ple
called <HI>Quakers</HI>) and having read
his book in Folio (some years since)
against,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occa|sion of the <HI>Disputa|tion.</HI></NOTE>
as I think above <HI>six score Books</HI> and <HI>Papers</HI>
(written by pious and able pens against them) and
now this Summer hearing of his coming into these
<PB N="2" REF="7">
Parts of <HI>N England,</HI> and the poor cheated Souls the
<HI>Quakers</HI> with joy expecting his coming,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G Fox</HI> his Book in <HI>Folio</HI> weighed.</NOTE> as the
coming of <HI>an Angel of light</HI> from Heaven: I read
over his Book afresh (as in the holy presence and
eye of God, (with a single Eye and Heart) and more
clearly finding his <HI>Answers</HI> so weak and silly, so
Anti-Christian and Blasphemous, and yet so Imperi|ous
and Scornfull, so Cursing and Censorious, [2]
Damning and Reprobating all that bow not down to
their new <HI>Upstart Image,</HI> my Spirit rose up within
me, and I believe the holy <HI>Spirit of God</HI> (in answer
to my poor Petitions and Meditations) resolved and
quickened my Spirit to the present <HI>Undertake</HI> and
Service. And therefore for his most holy Names
sake, and the name of his most holy only begotten,
the true <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> the <HI>God-Man</HI> and <HI>Mediator</HI>
&amp;c, And for the honour of the most holy <HI>Spirit
of God</HI> (so horribly torn in pieces by this foul <HI>Spi|rit
of the Quakers</HI>) For the vindicating of many of
the precious Truths of the old <HI>Christian purity,</HI> and
for the sake of so many precious Souls lying slain
and bleeding before me, I made this Offer follow|ing
to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and any or all his Followers or As|sociates,
then together at <HI>New-port</HI> on <HI>Rode-Iland.</HI>
Tis true <HI>G. Fox,</HI> was at <HI>Providence</HI> some few dayes
before, and spake publickly; and it was free for
me publickly to have heard him, and opposed him;
But going the last year to one of their general Assem|blyes
at <HI>New-Port,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Spirit of Confusion in the <HI>Qua+kers</HI> Meet|ings.</NOTE>
and having begun to present to
them some Considerations about the <HI>True Christ</HI> and
the <HI>false,</HI> the <HI>True Spirit</HI> and the <HI>False</HI> and being cut
of in the midest, by sudden <HI>Prayer</HI> of one, and the
<PB N="3" REF="7">
<HI>Singing</HI> of another, and then by the <HI>Prayer</HI> of
another and the sudden dissolving of the Assembly,
I resolved to try another way, and to offer a fair
and full <HI>Dispute,</HI> according to <HI>Ed. Burrowes</HI> (and
therein <HI>G Foxes</HI>) Offer in his large <HI>Epistle</HI> to <HI>Foxes</HI>
Book. To this Purpose I drew up my thoughts
into fourteen <HI>Propositions;</HI> and knowing that <HI>New-Port</HI>
was the chief Town on <HI>Rode-Iland</HI> and <HI>Provi|dence</HI>
on the <HI>Main,</HI> and that <HI>G. Fox</HI> had spake at

<P><HI>First</HI> That the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> are not true
Quakers according to the holy <HI>Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>2 That the <HI>Christ</HI> they profess is not the <HI>True

<P>3 That the <HI>Spirit</HI> by which they are acted is not
the <HI>Spirit os God.</HI></P>
<P>4 That they doe not own the holy <HI>Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>5 Their <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Professions,</HI> are full of
<HI>Contradictions</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisies.</HI></P>
<P>6 That their <HI>Religion</HI> is not only an <HI>Heresy</HI> in the
matters of <HI>Worship,</HI> but also in the Doctrines of <HI>Re|pentance
Faith.</HI> &amp;c</P>
<P>7 Their <HI>Religion</HI> is but a confused mixture of <HI>Po|pery,
Armineanisme, Socineanisme, Judaisme</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>8 <HI>The People called</HI> Quakers <HI>(in effect) hold no</HI> God,
no Christ, no Spirit, no Angel, no Devil, no Res|urrection,
no Judgment, no Heaven, no Hell, <HI>but
what is in man.</HI></P>
<P>9 All that their <HI>Religion</HI> requires (externall and
internall) to make <HI>Converts</HI> and Proselites, amounts to
no more than what a <HI>Reprobate</HI> may easily attain unto,
and perform.</P>
<P>10 That the Popes of Rome doe not swell with, and
<PB N="5" REF="8">
exercise a greater <HI>Pride,</HI> then the <HI>Quakers</HI> Spirit hath
exprest, and doth aspire unto, although many truly humble
Soules may be captivated amongst them, as may be in
other <HI>Religions.</HI></P>
<P>11 The Quakers <HI>Religion</HI> is more obstructive, and
destructive to the <HI>Conversion</HI> and <HI>Salvation</HI> of the
Souls of People, then most of the Religions this day ex|tant
in the world.</P>
<P>12 The <HI>Sufferings</HI> of the <HI>Quakers</HI> are no true evi|dence
of the Truth of their <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>13 That their many <HI>Books and writings</HI> are ex|tremely
Poor, Lame, Naked, and sweld up only with
<HI>high Titles</HI> and words of Boasting and <HI>Vapour.</HI></P>
<P>[4] 14. That the Spirit of their <HI>Religion</HI> tends
mainly,</P>
<P>1 To reduce Persons from <HI>Civility</HI> to <HI>Barbarisme.</HI></P>
<P>3 To an <HI>Arbetratry Goverment,</HI> and the Dictates
and Decrees of that <HI>sudden Spirit</HI> that acts them,</P>
<P>3 To a sudden cutting off of <HI>People,</HI> yea of <HI>Kings</HI>
and <HI>Princes</HI> opposing them.</P>
<P>4 To as fiery <HI>Persecutions</HI> for matters of Religion
and Conscience, as hath been or can be practised by any

<P>THis Paper above-said I sent inclosed in a Let|ter

was such a Knot of the Apostles of Christ Jesus

it might appear that such a Nehemiah as he would
not fly, it was [5] agreed that my Letters should
not be delivered to the <HI>Deputy Governour,</HI> untill <HI>G.

he never saw the Paper which I sent unto him. I

were not brought to him untill the 26th of the said

<HI>Iohn Burniat</HI> profest that that he knew noth|ing

I would be forced to be as plain in my <HI>Proofs</HI> as I

<P>To which I will not Answer as <HI>G. Fox</HI> an|swered
<HI>H. Wrights</HI> Paper with a scornfull and
shamefull <HI>Silence.</HI> Thus I say in generall, you are
my <HI>Witness,</HI> that I have long said with <HI>David</HI> (and
I humbly hope have made it good) I hate and
abhor <HI>Lying,</HI> but thy Law do I love, for which I
have lost in my time something, <HI>&amp;c</HI> If I had not

as much as your self, or any others in <HI>N. Eng|land,</HI>

<P>For <HI>your self,</HI> if the God of heaven have terri|fied
your Soul, (which I believe is the case of most

<P>In your lines I pray you to Consider,</P>

Assistance of Gods <HI>holy Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bruitish Simplicity of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Spirit.</NOTE> and of no little <HI>Af|sliction</HI>

<P>2. Can <HI>Reason</HI> imagine, that after much <HI>strug|ling</HI>
within my self, and the <HI>Birth</HI> of my <HI>Propo|sitions</HI>

and <HI>Smother,</HI> and Burn my <HI>Conceptions</HI> and Reso|lutions,
as soon as I hear your simple and childish
<HI>spirit</HI> Countermand me?</P>
<P>3. Is it not unmanly <HI>Childish</HI> and effeminate,
to cry out <HI>a Scurrilous paper, Lyes, Lyes, impu|dent
Slanders</HI> &amp;.c. and yet give me not one <HI>Reason</HI>

not too like the irrationall and brutish Answer of

Invalid. How childish didst thou act to swear against

<P>3. Tis true in your Exhortation to me, you bid

is given to every man <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This I acknowledg
<HI>Scripture.</HI> You say I wrested and added to an other

<P>4. As to <HI>Iohn Burnet,</HI> I said before him and
afterwards, that he delivered many <HI>Truths:</HI> yet
withall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I can give many In|stances of their abus|ing the Ordinance and Name of the <HI>Spirit of Prayer</HI> for a sudden <HI>Silencing</HI> of their Opposites.</NOTE> I then at the same time (in their <HI>Publick

them to manifest to their own <HI>Souls</HI> and others, 1.
That their <HI>Christ</HI> was <HI>true</HI> 2. That their <HI>Spirit</HI>
was <HI>Gods,</HI> and the rather because they were charged
with denying the <HI>Institutions</HI> of <HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> and
with the setting up of many <HI>Will-worships,</HI> as
<HI>Preaching of Women &amp;c.</HI> And I went on purpose
to <HI>Discourse</HI> of these matters (this being the time
of their <HI>Generall Assembly,</HI> and a great <HI>Concourse</HI>) I
<PB N="19" REF="15">
was stopt by the sudden praying of the <HI>Governour's

at home (meaning <HI>Christ</HI> which I had toucht upon)
I rose up and said, if a man had so alleadged, I
would have answered him: But I would not

(with Gods help) to be <HI>Patient</HI> and <HI>Civill,</HI>
and so I ceased, not seing a willingness in them for
me to proceed; which experience made me not to
trouble [13] <HI>G. Fox</HI> and the <HI>Assembly</HI> at <HI>Providence,</HI>
but rather to make a fair and Solemn offer of <HI>Dis|pute</HI>
about these matters: so that it is notorioufly

<HI>Damning,</HI> and I tell you that those words of <HI>Con|demnation</HI>
and <HI>Damnation</HI> are all one in your <HI>Greek</HI>

<P>COncerning the mistaking the Date of my Letter as
thou writest,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. T</HI> His third and last Letter to me.</NOTE> which could not be, seing I sent it
thee the same day I writ it, but thine, I heard of it
some dayes before I received it. As for my passing over
many particulars (which did not concern the matter in
handling) I willingly omitted them, discerning thy sub|til
spirit, in no respect answering by scripture or rea|son
my loving Admonitions to thee: But in thine own
words, is it not bruitish, irrationall, childish to affirm
<PB N="24" REF="18">
we are worse then <HI>Barbarians,</HI> which thy <HI>sordid Po|sitions</HI>

dost thou shew thy self in thy first <HI>Position,</HI> for <HI>G. Fox</HI>
to prove what he and all friends disown, and in scorn
thou callest <HI>Quakers.</HI> And in thy <HI>12th Position</HI> dost
affirm, <HI>That our Sufferings are no Evidence of the
truth of our Religion,</HI> Thou mightest have spar'd thy
paines in bringing [16] forth this Brat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">a <HI>Whore</HI> is as bold in her <HI>whore|doms,</HI> as a Chast Wise in her Ino|cency.</NOTE>
which is of
thine owne begetting: But we are sure it is an <HI>Evi|dence</HI>
against thee, &amp; all other of thy Spirit, which
persecute, that they have drunk deep of the Cup of
Fornication, upon whom the Violls of <HI>Gods wrath</HI> are
powred forth in <HI>spirituall Fornications.</HI></P>
<P>How darest thou find fault with me in not alleadging
<HI>scripture,</HI> nor <HI>reason</HI> in declaring against thy impious
Charges mentioned in thy railing &amp; impious <HI>positions?</HI>
Would'st thou have me to take the matter in hand
(which thou challengest <HI>G. Fox</HI> to answer) to give like
a fool scripture &amp; reason for what thou assignest another
to doe? Oh what Serpent-like spirit dost thou act by,
that dost not own my plain dealing with thee in owning
the scripture &amp; wrestest &amp; foistest in, as I meant not,
nor writ: If thy spirit were reall (as before men thy
words seem to import) thou wouldest not then shew a
smiling Countenance when War is in thine heart, in
witnessing against thy Neighbours secretly, against that
Golden rule, <HI>Doe as thou would'st be done by.</HI>
Thou countest it open violence for a Woman to speak in
the <HI>Church:</HI> but if thou knewest what <HI>Woman</HI> that
should not speake thou would'st have spared me these
lines writing, &amp; have eased thy selfe of thy great
struglings &amp; strivings within thee to bring forth on
<PB N="25" REF="18">
<HI>Abortive.</HI> Thou chargest me in making a great Out|cry
against thy Blood-thirsty spirit, concerning <HI>W.
Harris,</HI> as though thou didest at no time cry out Treo|son
Treason. <HI>Answ.</HI> how dost thou shift of as one
that is guilty, and dare not mention the case I writ up|on,
shufling it to be his last imprisonment, which I know
not the ground of, but as I had it related by thee: But
the Circumstances considered, it cannot possibly be par|aleld
(as my Letter declareth) with this last Case of
W. Harris. <HI>First,</HI> thy taking Oath against my wife
upon an other mans word on purpose to allay thy furious
spirit against <HI>W. Harris,</HI> he not thinking thou wouldest
have prosecuted against her, as also against sixteen of
thy peaceable neighbours, Can thou deny that at that
<HI>Court</HI> thou cryed not out <HI>Treason Treason,</HI> making all
as guilty as <HI>W. Harris?</HI> Thou sayest I bid thee mind
thy Book written against Persecution, and yet thy self a
<HI>Persecutor</HI> of thy peaceable Neighbours even unto death.
<HI>Answ.</HI> How canst thou in peace (through the God of
peace, (as thou sayest) look upon thy wicked Travels to
murther the Innocent as thou didest at <HI>Newport,</HI> cry|ing
out <HI>Treason</HI> being <HI>President.</HI></P>
<P>Also what I have spoken against <HI>W. Harris</HI> touch|ing
his firing the <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Colony,</HI> I thought so,

conscious of any recoyling in thy <HI>spirit,</HI> so much as in a
thought. Here thou manifest's an impious <HI>spirit</HI> that
seekes to murther the <HI>Innocent:</HI> what <HI>Fury</HI> possesseth
thee to talk of the <HI>God</HI> of peace &amp; yet retainest a
<HI>murtherous mind,</HI> not having repented of thy wick|ednesse,
how is thy heart hardned in seeking the lives of
<PB N="26" REF="19">
such as thou thy self hast confest to be the Children of
<HI>God?</HI> Oh murtherous man that hath not any <HI>Re|morse</HI>
for thy long-liv'd <HI>Wickedness,</HI> I am sorry for
thee, though thou slight all my writings &amp; counsells, &amp;
take all in the worst sence; yet I beseech thee to con|sider
thy latter end, &amp; my desire for thee is that the
<HI>Lord</HI> would awaken thy Soul &amp; give thee <HI>Repentance</HI>
unto life.</P>
<P>In the last place thou writest how highly I esteem of
<HI>G. Fox.</HI> and thou desirest to think as low of thy self:
How will this agree with thy boasting of great <HI>Edu|cation,</HI>
great <HI>Experiences,</HI> great struglings and striv|ings

which all my loving Testimonyes against (as issuing from
a diabolicall spirit) did no more take place with, then a

<NOTE PLACE="marg">My Ans|wer to <HI>I T.</HI> his 3d <HI>Assault</HI> up|on me.</NOTE>
<P>MY ancient Friend, it pleaseth the most High
to give to all mankind (his <HI>Children</HI> also and
them especially) many <HI>bitter Cups,</HI> and that often|times
by the hands of <HI>dear friends</HI> and [18] <HI>dear
Relations,</HI> that we might fall more in love with
himself then ever who isinfinitely more sweet, and
even Holiness and Power and Wisdom and Love
it self.</P>
<P>Your Lines (in this your third <HI>Fury</HI> against me)
being full of <HI>Bitterness</HI> in themselves, are more bit|ter
to my Spirit upon diverse accounts. But the
<HI>most High</HI> and <HI>only Wise</HI> will have it so, and your
judgment and Conscience (and mine) will have it
so, yet that will not acquit us, we both say we must
come to another <HI>Barr,</HI> and there stand or fall eter|nally.</P>
<P>In this, <HI>First.</HI> You tell me you willingly omit|ted
the Particulars I mentioned as not concerning
the matters in handling:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A deceit|full way of Answ.</NOTE> I am not of your mind,
it is an <HI>Easie</HI> yet a <HI>Suspicious</HI> way of answering, and
implyes not only unwillingness, but a <HI>willing Ignor|ance</HI>
and <HI>Guilt</HI> also: For is it not concerning the
matter in hand (especially when so personally pro|voked)
<PB N="28" REF="20">
to vindicate our selves and friends, our
Teachers and <HI>Apostles,</HI> our <HI>Spirits</HI> and Religion
also?</P>
<P>2. Next you blame my subtle spirit, for not
answering by Scripture or Reason your loving Ad|monitions:
I gave you my Reason, shewing how
simple it was for you to give fire upon me, and tell
me my <HI>Paper</HI> was <HI>Scurrilous, full fraught with im|pudent
Lyes and Slanders,</HI> and yet give me not one
<HI>Scripture</HI> nor <HI>Reason</HI> to prove any of them to be
so. 2. I shewed you how irrationall it was for
you to think, that I should so suddenly renounce
my understanding and <HI>Conscience</HI> and <HI>Positions</HI> upon
the sudden sound of your Outcry <HI>Repent, Repent.</HI></P>
<P>3. You tell me it is childish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hor|rid Naked|ness of the <HI>Q Women</HI> shews the worse then <HI>barbarous nakedness</HI> of their Spirits.</NOTE> bruitish and irra|tionall,
to say that you are worse then <HI>Barbarians:
Answ.</HI> I said not so in generall, you and all the
world ought to abhor the particular case, <HI>viz.</HI> the
stripping <HI>Naked</HI> of your <HI>Women</HI> and Maidens; a
case worse then Savage and Barbarous, only prac|tised
by the <HI>Bruites,</HI> and sometimes by <HI>Indians,</HI> and
<HI>Whores</HI> in their drink, when all <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Rea|son</HI>
is overwhelmed with more then common
<HI>Drunkenness.</HI> Who can but abhor to think of
such whorish and monstrous <HI>Immodesty,</HI> such an
hellish <HI>Incentive</HI> to filthy Lusts, and that under the
most holy name of the <HI>Spirit of God.</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>As</HI> to my first Position, you now tell me that
it is childish and foolish for <HI>G. Fox</HI> to prove (I sup|pose
you mean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">the name</NOTE> for me to desire <HI>G. Fox</HI> to prove)
what he and all friends disown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quakers.</NOTE> and thou in scorn
callest Quakers: <HI>Answ.</HI> I know the Quakers
<PB N="29" REF="20">
say [19] that name is given them in scorn, and
yet we also know it it hath its denomination from
those great bodily <HI>Shakings</HI> which have been be|lieved
to have come in mightily upon them by the
power of <HI>Devillish spirits</HI> (for many Reasons of
which afterward) However <HI>G. Fox</HI> in 370th. page
of his Book <HI>in Folio</HI> writes thus in the title of each
page <HI>[The Quakers answer. The Quakers Answer]</HI> I
know what may be said; and I know may be said
and justly to that excuse, and what shall be said in
the Dispute following.</P>
<P>5. As to my 12th. <HI>Position,</HI> of Suffering of the
<HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Qua|kers</HI> Suffer|ings.</NOTE> and you say it is a <HI>Brat</HI> of mine own, and
that is an evidence against me, and all os my <HI>Per|secuting

prove that you doe make it an <HI>Evidence</HI> of your
<HI>Religion,</HI> and then it must be your one <HI>Brat</HI> and
<HI>Bastard.</HI></P>
<P>As to my persecuting spirit, the most High hath
been a holy witness to my Travels and losses and haz|ards
and other sufferings, in my vindicating and pro|curing
<HI>Soul-liberty:</HI> and I humbly hope in his mercy,
he will preserve me from being like many <HI>Quakers,</HI>
fouly fallen from their former <HI>Christan Religion</HI></P>
<P>6. You say, <HI>How darest thou blame me for not
giving Scripture or Reason against thy railing and
impious Positions, when thou challengest and assignest
another to doe it</HI> G. Fox, <HI>&amp;.c. Answ.</HI> I only blamed
<HI>I. T.</HI> for being so fierce and furious, so hot and
hasty in crying out <HI>a scurrilous Paper fraught with
lyes and impudent slanders,</HI> and yet gave me not one
Scripture or Reason against any one of them: com|mon
<PB N="30" REF="21">
<HI>Modesty</HI> and humane <HI>Sobriety</HI> would have
taught a little Patience, till <HI>G. Fox</HI> had answered,
or untill you had answered something of <HI>Scripture</HI>
or <HI>Reason</HI> your self.</P>
<P>7. Nextly you tell me of my <HI>Serpent-like spirit</HI>
in witnessing against my neighbour secretly: To
which I lay before the most High, I know not
what you intend 2. I know it not to be any
Crime (much less a serpent-like spirit as your rail|ing

in private and publick, even against the <HI>highest</HI>
and dearest, in the matters of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI>
which ought to be only <HI>High</HI> and only <HI>Dear</HI>
unto us.</P>
<P>8. As to <HI>Womens preaching</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Womens Preaching.</NOTE> in the Church, you

expounded (which is an extraordinary signification
of Gods soveraign will and pleasure) where else one

(which is most improper and not suiting to the

of the matter, for you meant not <HI>W Harris</HI> his last

against your Wife upon an other mans word on
purpose to allay my furious spirit against <HI>W Har|ris.</HI>
These are your words, which may be taken
three wayes, but neither of them can I call to
mind: God knowes I truly desire to See, Lament
and forsake every Idle word or thought, which my
soul may be satisfied is so: for I dare not goe be|yond
(as you proudly doe) that <HI>Direction</HI> of the

your Wife and others, labouring to bring them in|to
the same guilt with <HI>W. Harris.</HI> whose facts and
courses others (of no small <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI>
amongst us, with whome I advised) saw to be des|perate
high <HI>Treason</HI> against the <HI>Laws</HI> of our
<HI>Mother England,</HI> and of this <HI>Colony</HI> also. When
<HI>W Harris,</HI> sent his <HI>writings</HI> or <HI>Books</HI> to the <HI>Main</HI>
and to the <HI>Iland,</HI> against all <HI>Earthly Powers, Par|liaments,

shortly cry out, <HI>no lords no masters;</HI> and had in open
Court protested, (before the whole <HI>Colony</HI> assem|bled)
that he would maintain his Writings with
his <HI>Blood.</HI> Was it my Fury (as you call it) or was
it not <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> to <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Colony</HI> and
the <HI>higher Powers</HI> then in <HI>England</HI> to act faithfully
and impartially in the place wherein I then stood
<HI>Centinell?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="22">
And it is not true that I sought his life as you
upbraid me, much less theirs, who purposely (as
the most high God is witness) were presented, that
some prudent course might be taken by the Court
for the preventing of their greater danger, and the

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="35" REF="23">
HItherto (gentle <HI>Reader</HI>) have been the <HI>Skir|mishings</HI>
of my <HI>Forlorn-Hope;</HI> I hasten now to
the relation of the main <HI>Battle,</HI> for after this my
third Letter and <HI>Answer,</HI> I heard no more of that
<HI>foul</HI> and <HI>slanderous spirit:</HI> I should rejoice to be in|strumentall
to his casting out of my ancient friend
<HI>I T.</HI> however he pluckt in his horns as <HI>G Fox</HI> him|self
did, and I have yet heard no further.</P>
<P>Within some few dayes after that our <HI>Deputy
Governour</HI> had [23] delivered my Paper to them,
the strange <HI>Quakers</HI> (as was agreed with <HI>G. Fox</HI>)
came to <HI>Providence.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first <HI>Interveni|ence</HI> at Provi|dence of the <HI>Qu.</HI> and my self.</NOTE> <HI>Iohn Stubs, Iohn Burnet,</HI> and
others, and came to my house six or seven together:
their <HI>Salutations</HI> were (like the meetings of their
<HI>dumb spirit</HI>) in silence. I bid them welcome <HI>&amp;.c.
Iohn Stubs</HI> began and said, they had received a
Paper from me, and they came to me to tell me,
that they accepted my <HI>Offer,</HI> and that they had
appointed (according to the liberty given them by
my self in my Paper) the 9th. of the present <HI>Au|gust</HI>
to be the day at <HI>Newport.</HI> I told them they
were welcome, and the more welcome because they
brought me tidings of their <HI>Resolution:</HI> for I longed
for <HI>Opportunityes</HI> of such <HI>Exercises,</HI> to which I
thought the most High invited us by our precious
<HI>Libertyes &amp;.c.</HI> I added that my Paper was in the
first place directed to <HI>G. Fox:</HI> but they suddenly
catcht at my word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G Fox <HI>his cunning</HI> Departure.</NOTE> and <HI>Iohn Burnet</HI> told me that
<HI>G. Fox</HI> was departed before my <HI>Letters</HI> were opened,
and that <HI>G. Fox</HI> never saw my Paper (and probably
as afterward in the dispute he spake honestlie not
knowing the Mistery) <HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> added that my
<PB N="36" REF="24">
Paper gave liberty to <HI>G. Fox</HI> or his friends. I sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
therefore I would not fail (if God pleased) to meet
them at the place, and by nine in the morning, on
the day they had appointed.</P>
<P>They departed (after drink offered and accepted
by some) but the next morning being the first of
the Week I sent them word in writing, that diverse
of our Neighbours were grieved that the <HI>Confer|ence</HI>
should be carried away from <HI>Providence</HI> to
<HI>Newport</HI> wholly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My care of ingaging them to my whole <HI>Offer</HI> and of discus|sing the latter seven at <HI>Provi|dence.</HI></NOTE>
(as some of them had also spoken)
I told them that the accepting of my <HI>Proffer</HI> ne|cessarily
included the Conference about the latter
seven at <HI>Providence:</HI> I told them their <HI>Consciences</HI>
and <HI>Credits</HI> lay on it, and therefore desired them to
six on a day for the dispute of the latter seven at
<HI>Providence</HI> before their departure hence. This Pa|per
was delivered to one of their Company in the
room where they were together, but whither on
purpose or (as tis possible) by mistake, they say the
Paper was lost: so receiving no Answer from them,
I late in the evening sent them another writing,
signifiing, that I could not hold my self ingaged to
meet them at <HI>Newport</HI> about the first seven, with|out
their promise of discussing the latter seven at
<HI>Providence.</HI> Then they wrote to me that I had
seemed willing, and that they had given notice, and
the Countrey would come in, therefore they
challenged me to appear and prove my malici|ous
[24] and bitter charges against them, and with|all
promised that upon the finishing of the first
seven at <HI>Newport,</HI> some of them would give me a
meeting a <HI>Providence &amp;.c.</HI> Upon the receipt of
<PB N="37" REF="24">
this, I sent them a third writing signifiing that I
rested in their Promise, and therefore (if God
pleased) I would not fail to be with them at the time
and place appointed. And God graciously assisted
me in rowing all day with my old bones so that I
got to <HI>Newport</HI> toward the <HI>Midnight</HI> before the
morning appointed.</P>
<P>Then I sent them a fourth Paper (with a Copie
of my first that miscaried as they said) and signi|fied
to them, that it would be convenient to agree
about some <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Transition,</HI> or passing from one
position to another: as also since they were <HI>many</HI>
and I but <HI>One,</HI> I presumed their Reason told them
that I expected but <HI>One at once,</HI> and that if
another desired to speak, the first should hold his
peace; as also I signified that some were scrupulous
of going into the <HI>Quakers Meeting-house,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scruples about meeting in the <HI>Qua|kers Meet|ing house</HI> at <HI>Newport</HI></NOTE> and ther|fore
I desired some thoughts about it: they thought
it convenient to send <HI>H. Bull</HI> to request me to goe
to his house to them; I went; they urged the <HI>Ca|paciousness</HI>
and <HI>Conveniency</HI> of their house, and I
told such as scrupled, that it was one thing to
goe into a <HI>Iewish Synagogue,</HI> or a <HI>Popish Chappell</HI> to
worship, or countenance their <HI>Worships:</HI> another
thing to <HI>Profess</HI> and <HI>Contest</HI> against them, in which
respect <HI>Paul</HI> disputed many dayes in the <HI>Iewes
Synagogues</HI> against them, and I could freelie goe in|to
the <HI>Popes Chappel,</HI> to dispute against the <HI>Pope</HI>
and his <HI>Worship.</HI></P>
<P>I knew our aged <HI>Governour Mr. Nich. Easton</HI>
&amp; other <HI>Magistrates</HI> (of their judgment) would be
there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">the way to Conquer.</NOTE> &amp; so the <HI>Civill Peace</HI> maintained, &amp; I had a
<PB N="38" REF="25">
strange <HI>assurance</HI> given in to my <HI>spirit</HI> from God in
answer to my poor requests <HI>&amp;.c. viz,</HI> that by <HI>Mod|eration</HI>
and <HI>Patience</HI> I should conquer their <HI>Immod|erations</HI>
and <HI>impatiencies,</HI> I therefore thought it in
vain to spend time about a <HI>Moderatour:</HI> Tis true
they gave me no Answer either by Speech, or writ|ing
concerning their coming on me one at once,
but to their seeming great advantage they constantly
fell on me <HI>all at once,</HI> and one of them <HI>William Ed|mundson</HI>
with grievous Language and insulting.</P>
<P>When I came into the place aforesaid I found
three able and noted preachers amongst them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Per|sons dis|puting with me.</NOTE> <HI>viz
Iohn Stubs, Iohn Burnet, William Edmunson</HI> sitting
together on an high Bench with some of the
<HI>Magistrates</HI> of their Judgment with them: I had
heard [25] that <HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> was learned in the <HI>He|brew</HI>
and the <HI>Greek</HI> (and I found him so) as for
<HI>Iohn Burnet</HI> I found him to be of a moderate <HI>Spirit,</HI>
and a very able Speaker.<NOTE PLACE="marg">W Ed|mundson <HI>described.</HI></NOTE> The third <HI>W. Edmund|son</HI>
was newly come (as was said) from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and
he proved the <HI>Chief Speaker,</HI> a man not so able nor
so <HI>moderate</HI> as the other two: For the two first
would speak <HI>Argument,</HI> and discuss and produce
<HI>Scripture:</HI> but <HI>William Edmundson</HI> was very ignor|ant
in the <HI>Scripture</HI> or any other Learning: He
had been a souldier in the late warres, a stout port|ly
man of a great voice, and fit to make a <HI>Braga|docia</HI>
(as he did) and a constant exercise meerly of
my Patience: he would often <HI>Vapour</HI> and preach
long, and when I had patiently waited till the <HI>Gust</HI>
was over, and began to speak, then would he stop
my mouth with a very unhandsome Clout of a
<PB N="39" REF="25">
grievous <HI>Interruption:</HI> so that sometimes I was forc't
to play the <HI>Moderator,</HI> and to protest that such
practises were against the sober rules of <HI>Civillity</HI>
and <HI>Humanity.</HI> It pleased God to help me with
such <HI>Patience</HI> to weather them, that <HI>Iohn Stubs</HI>
openly confest twice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I Stubs</HI> his Inge|nuity.</NOTE>
that though some others had
given them some interruptions, yet that I had not
done it.</P>
<P>I took my Seat at the other end of the house
opposite to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The be|ginning of the <HI>Dispute</HI></NOTE> and began telling them that the
<HI>most High</HI> was my witness, that not out of any pre|judice
against, or disrespect to the persons of the
<HI>Quakers</HI> (many of whome I knew and did love and
honour) nor any foolish Passion of pride or bold|ness
(for I desired to be sensible of my many de|cayes
of <HI>my house of Clay,</HI> and other wayes) nor any
earthly or <HI>worldly ends</HI> I had that occasioned this
trouble to my self and them.</P>
<P>I was first commanded this work from <HI>Heaven:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occa|sion of it.</NOTE>
Why should not this Argument be good for mee
and for others as well as the <HI>Quakers?</HI> they say their
commands are immediate (for <HI>Interpretations</HI> are
<HI>immediate</HI>) but I say they herein suffer <HI>Satan</HI> to
cheat them; for they say they pray, they fast, they
wait, they listen, they judge of the motions that
arise within them, and so have I done. The great
maker and searcher of all hearts knowes, that none
but his holy <HI>Majesty</HI> was privy to the <HI>Conception</HI> of
this business.</P>
<P>1. My end was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My ends.</NOTE> the vindicating his <HI>most holy
Name,</HI> which my Soul saw was trodden in the dirt
by <HI>Sathan</HI> clothed with <HI>Samuels Mantle,</HI> and the
<PB N="40" REF="26">
bright garment of an <HI>Angel of Light,</HI> which once
he was, but pride deceived him.</P>
<P>26] 2. I had in mine eye the vindicating this
<HI>Colony</HI> for receiving of such persons whome others
would not, we suffer for their sakes, and are ac|counted
their <HI>Abettors:</HI> that therefore together
with the improvemeut of our <HI>Libertyes</HI> which the
<HI>God of Heaven,</HI> and our <HI>Kings Majesty</HI> have gra|ciously
given us, I might give a publick testimony
against their <HI>Opinions</HI> in such a way and <HI>Exercise,</HI>
I judged it incumbent upon my <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Con|science</HI>
to doe it (in some regards) more than most
in the <HI>Colony.</HI> I may also truly say that</P>
<P>3. I had also in mine eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nicholas Davis</HI> drowned at <HI>Newport</HI> a little be|fore the <HI>Dispute.</HI></NOTE> that this exercise
might occasion some <HI>Soul Consideration</HI> in many. I
told them that we had a dolefull <HI>Alarum</HI> and in|struction
lately, we were taught what <HI>Salvation</HI> and
<HI>saving</HI> was, in the late death and drowning of a per|son
so known to us (and all <HI>N. England) Nicholas
Davis.</HI> I told them our case, and the case of all
mankind is his (in Spirituall and <HI>Soul matters) Oh a
world for an Oar, a Rope, a Plank.</HI> Only it must
be to all of us our work, to try whether our
<HI>Saviour</HI> our <HI>Salvation</HI> be reall, and not failing in so
great a Straight.</P>
<P>Some of these blessed ends it hath pleased God
to propagate by this occasion all this <HI>Colony</HI> over,
and all of us round about have put forth our selves
in <HI>Disquisitions</HI> and Searchings after the true grounds
of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> and <HI>Worship.</HI></P>
<P>I had many thoughts of beginning such an exer|cise
with <HI>Prayer</HI> unto God for his Presence:<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Prayer was used.</NOTE> but I
<PB N="41" REF="26">
knew I could not joyn with them nor would they
owne my <HI>Prayers:</HI> I had thoughts (as <HI>Eliah</HI> among
the <HI>Baalites</HI>) to have prayed in the singular number:
But some <HI>Considerations</HI> made my spirit content
with this kind of Petition unto God: For not only
in my <HI>Closet</HI> and my heart, but publickly before
them all I said, <HI>I doe humbly hope and beg of</HI> God
<HI>the</HI> Father <HI>of Spirits so to order and direct our Spirits
in these our Agitations, that his holy name may receive
glory, and the</HI> Soules <HI>of all of us some</HI> Soul-profit <HI>and
Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>I began with the first Position, which I think <HI>W.
Edmunson</HI> also read out of the Paper. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That the People called Quakers are not true Quakers
according to the Scriptures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first <HI>Position.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>1. I said I knew they did not owne that name
<HI>Quakers,</HI> as imposed on them by God, or taken up
by themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The name <HI>Quakers.</HI></NOTE> but given them in scorn and derision,
as <HI>G. Fox, Ed. Burrowes</HI> (and I had heard <HI>Iohn

27] one <HI>Gervace Bennet, a Iustice</HI> in <HI>Derby</HI> first
so called them in the year 1650 And yet I had
cause to judg that the name was given by <HI>Iustice
Bennet</HI> and others to them from that strange and
uncouth possessing of their bodyes. with quaking
and <HI>shaking</HI> of their <HI>Bodyes</HI> even in publick Assem|blyes
and Congregations, which extraordinary mo|tions
I judged to come upon them, not from the
holy <HI>Spirit</HI> and Power of God, but from the spirit
and power of <HI>Sathan</HI> for diverse <HI>Reasons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> Although they pretend that <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Da|vid</HI>

about the <HI>Protestant Reformation</HI> from the ruines
and rubbish of the old <HI>Manicheans</HI> and <HI>Gnosticks,</HI>
and other blind Guides who swarmed in the first
third and fourth Christian <HI>Centuryes,</HI> until the <HI>Pope</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="27">
swallowed up all the lesser <HI>Serpents,</HI> and so became
a <HI>Dragon</HI> with seven Heads and ten Horns, forcing
all with fire and Fagot to deny <HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> and to
martch under Anti-Christ (the <HI>Anti-christ</HI> the man
of sin) his Colours.</P>
<P>Some of these Particulars I could not then ex|press,
but think [28] fit here to remember the for|mer
dayes, for Information of such as doe desire it.</P>
<P>These People came from <HI>Lancashire</HI> and other
northern parts to the Southward of <HI>England</HI> and to
<HI>London.</HI> I spake with some of their Chief then in
<HI>London,</HI> I knew it was the old proud <HI>spirit</HI> which
had appeared in so many foul lyes in their former
deceived and deceiving <HI>Leaders,</HI> and I was the more
confirmed in my thoughts when I saw their foul
<HI>spirit</HI> so transport them, not only in lying <HI>Doctrines,</HI>
but lying <HI>Quakings</HI> and <HI>Tremblings,</HI> lying preaching
through the Streets <HI>Repent, Repent:</HI> and lying and
abominable <HI>Nakedness</HI> of men and women, untill
their ugly Child and Daughter <HI>Rantisme</HI> rose from
their Bowels and practised <HI>Nakedness</HI> of men and
women in the Streets and in their religious <HI>Meet|ings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Rant|ers <HI>are but</HI> the Quak|ers <HI>Daughter</HI></NOTE>
as <HI>Adamites:</HI> when it is notorioufly known
they fell into many <HI>uncleannesses</HI> and <HI>Adulteryes.</HI> To
my face and to the world in print they maintaind,
there were no sins in them: Saying <HI>That the Saints
could not sin, and God did all and was all,</HI> and they
were <HI>as pure as Adam and God himself,</HI> this is known
by the Writings extant <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. Again I said unto my <HI>Antagonists</HI> that the
manner of these <HI>quakings</HI> and <HI>shakings</HI> were not as of
those <HI>quakings</HI> and tremblings of <HI>David, Moses,</HI> and
<PB N="44" REF="28">
the <HI>Corinths</HI> receiving <HI>Titus</HI> with Trembling, or
the working out Salvation with <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">True Qua|king</NOTE>
for that may many wayes be proved to be the <HI>Soul</HI>
and <HI>Spirit,</HI> out of a holy Aw and Dread of the
<HI>Majesty</HI> of Heaven with whome we have to deal,
who only can pitty and help us in our deplorable
and forlorn conditions: Hee it is who worketh
the <HI>Will</HI> and the <HI>Deed,</HI> and therefore with deep
impressions of <HI>Aw</HI> and <HI>Dread</HI> we ought to attend
upon all his holy meanes appointed, wherein (as of
old in the Tabernacle and Temple) he hath prom|ised
to come to us. Beside, as it is naturall for the
Body to tremble when the mind doth, as we see in
many Persons in the beginning of a Battle, or go|ing
over a deep Water, or going to suffer Death,
or looking over a high <HI>Clift</HI> into the sea <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So
when the Bodies of those holy men, or any now
doe so tremble <HI>Experience</HI> proves it that it is no
ordinary motion, but extraordinary, and upon
extraordinary occasions, and those holy and hea|venly
Occasions, as may be instanced.</P>
<P>But the quaking and shaking motions of the
<HI>Quakers</HI> (as I shall prove) they proceeded not from
those holie Affections [29] proper to Gods Chil|dren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The horrid <HI>shaking</HI> of the <HI>Qua|kers.</HI></NOTE>
so also they were horrid and monstrous cast|ing
their bodies into horrid and monstrous motions
and Gestures which mine eyes have seen: Besides
the abundance of notorious Instances, what strange
horrid motions are those which <HI>Theora Iohn</HI> (as he
madly calls himself) and <HI>Iohn Toldervy</HI> were tost
and tumbled up and down with? which cannot
<PB N="45" REF="28">
be imagined to proceed from the holy <HI>Spirit of God,</HI>
but from Sathan to delude and cheat poor sinners
with.</P>
<P>To this purpose I told them at the first coming
of this spirit to <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> some <HI>Par|liament
men</HI> told me that themselves went to one
of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meetings about <HI>Charing Cross,</HI> but
were so affrighted with the <HI>shaking</HI> of their own
bodies, and of their <HI>Chairs</HI> and Stooles under them,
that they could never again be got into their <HI>As|semblyes.</HI></P>
<P>I added,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satans Counter|feit moti|ons.</NOTE> that such <HI>Shakings, Motions, Extasies,
&amp;c.</HI> were known to be the frequent workings of
<HI>Sathan</HI> upon his Servants in all ages, Such were
the furious motions of <HI>Baals Preists,</HI> the motions
of the <HI>Possessed</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Gospells,</HI> and other
<HI>Historyes,</HI> and known to be amongst the <HI>Barba|rians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers Answer.</NOTE>
our Neighbours about this time. <HI>Iohn Bur|net</HI>
and <HI>William Edmunson</HI> rose up and said that I
had laid many deep and heavy <HI>Charges</HI> upon the
people of the Lord, which I should never be able
to prove: I had denied them to be <HI>Christians,</HI>
and so had wronged the good Spirit of God in
them, and their Profession of worshipping God in
the Spirit: Yea I had taken away their being (as
men) out of the World, as a dangerous People to
<HI>Nations</HI> and <HI>Kingdomes</HI> &amp; <HI>Common-weales,</HI> yea to
<HI>Kings</HI> &amp; <HI>Princes,</HI> and so not fit to live amongst
men in the World. These Speeches were often
uttered and enlarged by one or other of them,
and that with Zeal (and Passion in <HI>W. Edmunson</HI>)</P>
<P>I waited patiently till these <HI>Gusts</HI> of their angry
<PB N="46" REF="29">
Spirit was over, and then I told them I had not
wronged them in a tittle: But by the help of the
most High I would make all good against them,
&amp; toen leave it to every mans and womens Soul
to judge at their own Perill.</P>
<P><HI>About this time</HI> Iohn Stubs <HI>alleadged that of</HI>
Paul, <HI>Phil</HI> 2. Work out salvatson with fear and
Trembling.</P>
<P>I replyed I in no way opposed the awfull and
most serious impressions of <HI>Gods Majesty</HI> in all his
appearances &amp; ordinances upon the Soules and Spi|rits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quaking and Trembling</NOTE>
yea and <HI>Bodyes</HI> of Gods Children. [30] But
I denied that those places to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> and
<HI>Philippians</HI> concerned any such bodily shakings
and quakings as we now debated.</P>
<P>Beside I said if <HI>Quaking</HI> and <HI>Trembling</HI> were a
Command and an Ordinance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Ordi|nance of God</NOTE> and institution of
God to be practised, then was it constantly to be
practised (as the <HI>Iewes</HI> say of <HI>Cain</HI> that the Mark
which God set upon him was a constant <HI>Trembling</HI>)
Or if not alwayes, yet alwayes in <HI>Worship,</HI> or if not al|wayes
in <HI>Worship</HI> yet at some certain times. But
the plain truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Counter|feit <HI>Qua|king</HI> and <HI>Trembling</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Devill</HI> will be <HI>Gods Ape</HI> in
most things: He subornes and substitutes a bastard
<HI>Quaking and Trembling</HI> of the body in Imitation of
<HI>David, Moses &amp;c.</HI> on purpose to thrust out the true
Fear and Trembling which ought to be constantly
in us, raising up all our Affections and all within
us to a due sence of the <HI>Terror</HI> of the Lord, the
dreadfulness of our <HI>Danger,</HI> and the wonder of our
<HI>Deliverance</HI> (which we can never make too sure)
from sin and wrath to come to all eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="29">
I also declared, that the <HI>most High</HI> and holy one,
was free as he pleased to cause the trembling of the
<HI>Soules</HI> of his People to over flow with influence upon
their <HI>Bodyes</HI> also, asin <HI>Moses, David, Daniel, Ha|bakkuk,
Paul, &amp;c.</HI> this is like to be in some extraor|dinary
cases and <HI>Conversions</HI> or turnings to God, as
<HI>Paul</HI>'s was, and that especially in bringing of <HI>great
Sinners</HI> or <HI>old Sinners</HI> unto himself <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There were some few Speeches, some from the
<HI>Governour</HI> and his Wife, and some few others that
spake, some in favor of, and some against the <HI>Qua|kers,</HI>
but neither did my Opposites nor I so far at|tend
them as to engage with them, excepting some
Turnes that were between <HI>William Edmunson,</HI> and
<HI>William Hitchcock</HI> (an Inhabitaut of <HI>Newport</HI>) who
(as others did) witnessed against their upbraiding
me with my age <HI>(Old man, Old man</HI> &amp;c.) as also
for their <HI>Interruptions.</HI></P>
<P>Mine own Brother Mr <HI>Robert Williams,</HI> School-Master
in <HI>Newport,</HI> desired to speak: nor he nor
others dissenting from them could be permitted,
except they would set their hands to my Paper.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Paper put in of two great <HI>Considera|tions</HI></NOTE>
My Brother (unknown to me) put in a paper to
them, which he took the liberty to read, desiring
that two things might be answered by the <HI>Quakers.</HI>
1. The matter of the true sence of <HI>Sin</HI> as Sin. 2.
Of the <HI>Materiallity</HI> of such a Person as the <HI>Lord
Iesus Christ,</HI> and the materiallity of his [31] <HI>Bloud|shedding.</HI>
This Paper they took but waved it. <HI>W.
Edmunson</HI> openly charged me with breach of Cove|nant,
<HI>viz.</HI> That if any would speak on my behalf,
they should set their hand to my <HI>Propositions.</HI> Tis
<PB N="48" REF="30">
true it was desired by one of them at my house at
<HI>Providence,</HI> that if any joined with me, they should
subscribe to my Paper.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The une|quall Termes of the <HI>Qua|kers</HI> en|joining <HI>Subscrip|tion.</HI></NOTE>
But I answered that I was
<HI>alone</HI> in the Business, I had not consulted with any
others but the God of heaven himself: so that I
denied vehemently that there was any such agree|ment,
or any colour for it. Besides it was ridiculous
to put either such a <HI>Bar</HI> and Limit upon any mans
spirit, and least of all upon Gods <HI>Spirit, viz,</HI> that
no man should desire leave to object or querie <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
except first he would subscribe my <HI>Proposalls</HI> But
I took the boldness justly to charg them with pal|pable
and gross <HI>Partiality</HI> viz. that <HI>W. Hitchcock</HI>
and others, (opposing or dissenting) might not speak,
but <HI>W. Harris, W. Dyar</HI> or any favouring of them
might speak without exception,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&amp; their open <HI>Par|tiality.</HI></NOTE> because all that
speak for their ptetended light, it must be supposed
that they speak from the Spirit of God himself:
others out of <HI>Ignorance, Malice and Envy:</HI> this will
appear more afterward.</P>
<P>However, there were these few debates about the
liberty of speech in the Auditory and By-standers,
and the <HI>Quakers</HI> deniall and enjoining of <HI>Subscrip|tion:</HI>
yet the most High, <HI>Father of Spirits</HI> did so
compose all spirits, that it was wonderfull that such
<HI>Opposites</HI> should goe through such a work and Con|slict
all day untill night, without more <HI>Interruptions</HI>
and <HI>Disturbances.</HI></P>
<P>I was ready and waited to put forth my third
Reason to prove they were not true Christian Qua|kers,
it was from Isai. 66. <HI>To this man will I look
that is poor and contrite, and trembleth at my</HI> Word. I
<PB N="49" REF="30">
told them that <HI>G. Fox</HI> in his Book all along was so
far from trembling at the <HI>Word of God</HI> in the holy
Writings or <HI>Scriptures,</HI> that he could not endure
they should have that name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers evill spirit <HI>to|ward the holy</HI> Scrip|tures.</NOTE> or be once called the
<HI>Word of God,</HI> Tis true I know his pretence, that
<HI>Christ Iesus</HI> is called the <HI>Word of God,</HI> Rev. 19.
But I know tis true also that he grants the Scrip|tures
to be true, and inspired from the holy <HI>Spirit
of God,</HI> and to be Gods words, though not his <HI>Word.</HI>
Well, to pass by the simplicity of the <HI>Distinction,</HI>
and let us take what he grants, and is it not prodigi|ous
and monstrous Contempt that these holy Words,
this holy Book and Writing of God should be so
undervalued and slighted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light of each man in the World above the <HI>Scriptures.</HI></NOTE> yea vilified [32] and nul|lified,
if compar'd with their pretended <HI>new found
Light</HI> within them, which was (say they) before the
<HI>Scriptures,</HI> and gave forth the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and there|fore
was above the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and gave forth the
<HI>Scriptures,</HI> and therefore was above the <HI>Scriptures,</HI>
and therefore is not judged or tried by the <HI>Scrip|tures,</HI>
but they by it. Yea, and this light must be
in every one of mankind in the whole World:
Hence it was that these holy Writings were so
disused in their own private Readings, in their
Publick Worship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Quakers</HI> great affec|tion and ownness against the holy <HI>Scrip|tures.</HI></NOTE>
and in their Families.</P>
<P>I told them God was little beholding to the <HI>Pope</HI>
and the <HI>Quakers</HI> for their humble Reverence and
great Affection to his holy <HI>Letters, Declarations</HI> and
<HI>Proclamations.</HI> The Pope had his <HI>Infallibility</HI> as
well as they, his immediate <HI>Inspirations</HI> as well
as they: They both owned, and yet did not owne
the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> the Pope and they only must
<PB N="50" REF="31">
interpret <HI>Scriptures,</HI> they only give the <HI>Sence,</HI> they
only judge all <HI>Controversies:</HI> yea they dispence with
the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and if they were quite lost and
burn'd and not a Copy of them left in the World,
yet there were no loss but a good Turn, a good Rid|dance,
for then the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Quakers Infallible
spirit</HI> and its immediate <HI>Inspirations,</HI> would be more
esteemed and set by.</P>
<P>I produced an Instance of one <HI>Thurston</HI> an Apos|tle
of theirs who came to <HI>Providence</HI> with extraor|dinary
long hair hanging over his shoulders;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An In|stance of a long-haird profane <HI>Qua. slight|ing Nature</HI> and the <HI>Scriptures.</HI></NOTE> It
was so long that an aged Soul (captivated for
present amongst them) the wife of <HI>C.S.</HI> demanded
of him why he ware it so long since Nature it
self did teach it to be a shame for a man to wear
<HI>long Hair,</HI> as the <HI>holy Scripture</HI> affirmed? He would
not say, He car'd not what <HI>Nature</HI> or the holy
<HI>Scriptures</HI> said, but he said as much in effect (as she
told me her self, and may with true fear and tremb|ling
still think on it) <HI>viz.</HI> when that God that bid
me wear it, bids me cut it off, the will I cut it off.
As if he would say, what tell you us of the teach|ings
of <HI>Nature</HI> (as we see in that monstrous case
of their womens <HI>Nakedness</HI>) or what tell you me of
Scripture? I have a <HI>Light</HI> within me that made
that <HI>Light,</HI> was before it, gave it forth, &amp; is above
it. This mans hair was so offensive and odious,
that meeting of me, and saying, <HI>Fear the Lord God,</HI>
I could not but answer him in these words, <HI>viz.
What God dost thou mean a Ruffians God?</HI> alluding to
that of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Titus, They profess to know God, but
in their Works they deny him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="31">
33] I told them the rage of the Devill in all Ages
had been most fierce against these heavenly <HI>Records,</HI>

the glorious <HI>Appearances</HI> of the eternall <HI>Invisible
King</HI> in the former <HI>Generations</HI> of mankind from
the Creation of the World, as also the <HI>Wonders</HI> yet
to be finished till time should be no more, all which
were in the holy <HI>Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>I remembred them of a profane bloudy Wretch
in <HI>Ireland</HI> who in the late horrid <HI>Massacre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An hori|ble In|stance in <HI>Ireland</HI> against the <HI>Holy Scrip|tures.</HI></NOTE> hunting
(among other bloudie Wolves) after the Goods and
Lives of the <HI>Protestants,</HI> found a <HI>Bible,</HI> and with
Indignation (the same which I believe is in most
<HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI>) he flung it into the <HI>Kennell,</HI> and
<HI>stampt</HI> upon it with his feet saying, <HI>A Plague of God
take this Book, this hath caused all the Quarrels
among us.</HI></P>
<P>Whether I spake all these Particulars at one indi|viduall
time or Turn I cannot clearly remember,
only I am certain thus I spake and more.</P>
<P>My Opposites once and again had Turnes of
Speech, but still the only sum of all was, that they
owned the <HI>Scripture,</HI> but yet the <HI>Spirit</HI> that gave it
forth was above it, withall they urged that I could
not prove where in the Scripture, the <HI>Scripture</HI> was
called <HI>the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answered,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scrip|tures</HI> the word of <HI>God.</HI></NOTE> That many things were infallibly
so, and true although not in so many Terms and
Words mentioned: But yet there were abundance
of <HI>Scriptures</HI> wherin the <HI>Prophets</HI> did expresly say,
<PB N="52" REF="32">
<HI>Thus saith the Lord, The Word of the Lord came unto
me,</HI> and Hebr. 1. <HI>The Lord spake diverse wayes, and
at diverse times in the Prophets, but now he hath spoken
by his Son.</HI> Sure his Speech is his Word: Hence
the <HI>Word of God</HI> is the Word preached, as <HI>Paul,</HI> 2

the</HI> Word <HI>of God, Act.</HI> 19 which preaching of the
Word &amp; growing of the word were not compe|tent
and proper expressions to be affirmed of the
perfon of the <HI>Lord Iesus;</HI> especially I told them I
would use the words of the <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> when he
fought with the <HI>Devil</HI> that famous <HI>Combate, Math.</HI> 4.
No other Weapon did he use against him but <GAP DESC="foreign">
<HI>It is written,</HI> and again, <HI>It is written, It is written,</HI>
here <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> quotes <HI>Dut 8. Man shall not live
by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of God:</HI> where <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Christ Iesus</HI>
affirm [34] that God hath many words, contrary to
what some <HI>Quakers</HI> hath affirmed to me saying, <HI>that
God hath no more words but one,</HI> and <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> here
affirmeth, That every appearance and providence
of God, is a word proceeding out of the mouth of
<HI>God,</HI> as well as this holy Scripture he alleadged.
Though yet it is true, that <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> is the <HI>Word,</HI>
or declared Mind of <HI>God,</HI> incomparably above all his
<HI>spoken</HI> or <HI>written</HI> or <HI>providentiall</HI> Words and Expres|sions:
He came out of the <HI>Bosome</HI> of the <HI>Eternal
Father,</HI> and brought the brightest Revelations of
his eternal <HI>God-head</HI> &amp; <HI>Councels,</HI> and therefore is
most justly and eminently stiled the <HI>Word of God.</HI></P>
<P>I urged that the <HI>Word</HI> or <HI>Words</HI> of God were
<HI>Figurative</HI> Speeches, for properly God had no <HI>Mouth,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="32">
nor <HI>Tongue,</HI> nor <HI>Lips,</HI> nor <HI>Heart</HI> nor <HI>Brains &amp;c.</HI> but
as our Kings Majesty his <HI>Declaration</HI> touching <HI>Re|ligion,</HI>
his royal <HI>Charters,</HI> his <HI>Letters</HI> from <HI>Breda</HI> are
often insisted on and urged by the <HI>Quakers</HI> as the
word of a King, though his writings contain many
hundred words; so it is with the <HI>King of Heaven</HI> his
<HI>Scriptures</HI> and writings <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I had oft occasion to mention <HI>G. Fox</HI> and <HI>Ed. Bur|rowes</HI>
their <HI>Book</HI> in Folio called <HI>The great Mystery</HI>
&amp;c. upon which <HI>W Edmundson</HI> reproved me for
speaking of <HI>G. Fox</HI> and <HI>E. Burrowes</HI> in scorn and
derision (so his words were) I guest he took me as
if I had scornfully intended <HI>G Fox</HI> in his <HI>Burrowes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occa|sion of the <HI>Title</HI> of this <HI>Book.</HI></NOTE>
but I had openly purged my self, protesting before
the Lord, that I had no such thought, yet this Pas|sage
was the occasion of the <HI>Title</HI> of the <HI>Book:</HI> For
the finger of <HI>Gods</HI> most wise and holy Providence
is often wonderfully seen in small, unexpected &amp; in|considerable
Turns and Occasions: In such poor
<HI>shells</HI> oftimes may be found the <HI>Kernels</HI> of rich
and usefull <HI>Observations.</HI> Sure (thought I) Gods
holy Finger is in it, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> and <HI>Ed. Burrowes</HI>
(Men so qualified and named) should so notori|oufly
conspire against the true <HI>Lord Iesus Christ</HI> in
their dark and subtle hellish Contrivings and <HI>Imagi|nations.</HI>
It was also Gods overruling hand that
<HI>VV. Edmundson</HI> should so upbraid me, and first put
the <HI>Conceit</HI> and thought of such a Consideration in|to
me, which I apprehended as <HI>Digitus Dei</HI> the
finger of God directing and pointing me to so pro|per
and pertinent an use and Application.</P>
<P>Thus the only Wise and Righteous <HI>King</HI> catcheth

all thy wayes beyond our thoughts and finding out!</HI></P>
<P>To proceed, I had observed and prepared many
<HI>Quotations</HI> out of <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Book, but they desired
not to hear them read, as in the following dayes of
<HI>Conference</HI> they were read by my continual importu|nate
Urgings: I say at first I could not get opor|tunity
to insist upon some Particulars, a Tast whereof
I think now fit to present the Reader with.</P>
<P><HI>In</HI> Page 155. <HI>of</HI> G. Foxes <HI>aforesaid Book he brings

that they will tell us that we have <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI>
and <HI>God</HI> within us, and that we can speak and write
<HI>holy Scripture,</HI> not remembring that (as <HI>Christ Iesus</HI>
said of the <HI>Temple</HI>) our hearts are <HI>Dens</HI> of Thieves
and (like painted <HI>Tombs</HI>) full of dead mens bones
and rottenness, [36] untill a second <HI>Birth</HI> by the

<P><HI>Again,</HI> in the same Page <HI>G. Fox</HI> brings his Oppo|site
saying, <HI>[And to say every mans</HI> Light <HI>is the true</HI>
word of Prophecy <HI>is</HI> an old Fable, <HI>no man shall be
able to spell out a syllable of the</HI> Gospel <HI>by all that is

<HI>[The Light that enlightens every man is</HI> Christ, <HI>and
the sure</HI> Word of Prophecy <HI>to him he shall find it]</HI>
In this Passage who can but see their <HI>horrible</HI> and
<HI>simple</HI> profaning and wresting of plain <HI>Scripture:</HI>
Is it not clear as day to him that is not willingly
<HI>blind,</HI> that this <HI>word of prophecy</HI> in <HI>Peter,</HI> is the
<PB N="56" REF="34">
Word which the <HI>Prophets</HI> spake and writ of <HI>Christ
Iesus,</HI> unto whome the spirit of God in <HI>Peter</HI> sends
us, as being a more sure and convincing <HI>word</HI> to us
then that voice which <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> affirmed that
they heard from heaven in the Mount of <HI>Transfigu|ration?</HI>
But thus <HI>profanely</HI> and <HI>simply</HI> do others of
them affirm this <HI>Light</HI> to be that <HI>Prophet</HI> which
<HI>Moses</HI> wrote of, <HI>Deut.</HI> 18. whereas the <HI>holy Spirit</HI> in
<HI>Stephen Acts</HI> 7. applyes expresly that <HI>Prophesie</HI> to
the person of the <HI>Lord Iesus,</HI> that <HI>God-man</HI> in one
person, whome <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Stephen</HI> preached the
great <HI>Messiah,</HI> or <HI>Christ</HI> the anointed <HI>Prophet, Priest</HI>
and <HI>King</HI> unto all that receive or believe in him.</P>
<P>Now diverse observing and publickly expressing
how unsuitable it was that three of the ablest
<HI>Speakers</HI> amongst them should <HI>Consult</HI> openly and
<HI>whisper</HI> and utter themselves one immediately after
each other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tu|multuous spirit of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in Disputing.</NOTE> and somtimes <HI>all together</HI> as one man

saying, that it was mine own <HI>Paper</HI> (which he often
produced) which exprest my Offer to make good
my <HI>Positions</HI> against all <HI>Comers:</HI> But I replyed
(once and again) That as God is a God of <HI>Order,</HI>
and doth all things in <HI>Number, Weight</HI> and <HI>Measure,</HI>
in most admirable <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Method,</HI> so I had
thought that (according as I writ and spake to
them) they would have had so much <HI>Ingenuity</HI> to
conceive, that nor I nor any man was so simple as
to offer to Dispute with, to oppose and to answer
twenty or thirty or one hundred at once: But thus
like subtle and impudent <HI>Foxes</HI> and <HI>Iesuites</HI> they
pleaded and practised from the beginning of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tis hard to hold the <HI>Foxians</HI> or any guil|ty disputant to a fair Dispute.</NOTE>
<PB N="57" REF="34">
<HI>Conference</HI> unto the end of the <HI>4th</HI> day, resolving to
make use of and (like dying men by drowning) to
catch at any ridiculous <HI>Advantage</HI> though <HI>unchris|tian</HI>
and <HI>uncivill.</HI></P>
<P>But the truth is, this and many other <HI>Discourage|ments</HI>
and <HI>Disadvantages</HI> and <HI>Difficultyes</HI> the <HI>Lord
Iesus</HI> graciously and faithfully [37] (For his name
sake) enabled me to cut through, otherwise I saw
the <HI>Debate</HI> would not have held on so many <HI>Hours</HI>
as it did <HI>Dayes,</HI> I knew they had as much mind to
this work (no nor any guilty <HI>Soul</HI> in the world) as
<HI>Bears</HI> to be tyed to a stake to be baited; and I must
humbly declare and predicate it (to the praise of
the <HI>Father of mercyes,</HI> and for the incouragement of
others to be <HI>Patient</HI> for <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> sake) that an
hand from heaven caried me through to the end of
each day, and to the end of the whole business.</P>
<P>Sometimes I offered to proceed to an other <HI>Point,</HI>
but all this first day was spent upon the first <HI>Point</HI>
of <HI>true</HI> and <HI>false Quakers:</HI> For though many upon
a sudden spake as <HI>Mr. Coddington Mr. Easton</HI> (then
Governour, who spake sharply) <HI>VVilliam Dyer,
VVilliam Harris</HI> and others against me, yet I
minded closely what my <HI>Antagonists</HI> vented, who
were placed on high in their <HI>Desk</HI> against me: <HI>Iohn
Stubs</HI> and <HI>Iohn Burnet</HI> were more sober and manly,
but <HI>VV. Edmundson</HI> (who was the junior of three)
would speak all like <HI>Solomons</HI> foolish woman, <HI>loud</HI>
and <HI>clamorous, simple</HI> and <HI>knowing nothing,</HI> being in
truth nothing but a <HI>flash</HI> of wit, a <HI>Face of Brass,</HI>
and a <HI>Tongue</HI> set on <HI>fire</HI> from the <HI>Hell of Lyes and
Fury.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="35">
One <HI>Instance</HI> here fell out, for when I urged that
it was not what man had <HI>within him</HI> already, and
brought into the world with him, that made a true
<HI>Quaker,</HI> but the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> accompanying and
blessing the <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Hearing</HI> of the <HI>writings</HI>
of <HI>God preached</HI> and <HI>opened:</HI> I said the <HI>Heart</HI> of man
was shut up lockt and barr'd up in <HI>willing Ignorance</HI>
and <HI>darkness</HI> until the <HI>finger of God</HI> in the use of
those and other blessed meanes, <HI>pick</HI> open in a more
gentle way, or <HI>break</HI> open by great afflictions and
and <HI>terrours</HI> the <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of man. I said
that <HI>Paul</HI> preached the <HI>word</HI> by the River side, but
the Lord opened the heart of <HI>Lydia:</HI> and while I
was saying that, <HI>It was not Paul nor Pauls Preach|ing
nor the word that he preached</HI>&mdash;at this word
<HI>VV. Edmondson</HI> clamour'd out, <HI>He speakes Blasphe|my:</HI>
But it pleased God to move the heart of our

to witness against this <HI>Interruption</HI> saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Ed|mondsoo</HI> justly re|proved by the Depu|ty Gover|nor Capt. <HI>Cranston</HI></NOTE> <HI>Let
him have liberty to make out his mind:</HI> So I proceeded
and said, it may be <HI>VV. Edmnndson</HI> is offended as
thinking I spoke against the <HI>word Christ;</HI> but <HI>Christ
Iesus</HI> knowes that I had no such thought, but of the
words which <HI>Paul</HI> spake. And I added that it was
not <HI>Lydia</HI> nor all her <HI>Light</HI> within her, nor <HI>Paul</HI>
nor [38] his <HI>Preaching,</HI> nor the <HI>word</HI> nor <HI>words</HI>
that he uttered, but the Finger of <HI>Gods Spirit</HI> (ac|cording
to <HI>Election</HI>) that set the <HI>word</HI> or <HI>words</HI> of
<HI>Paul</HI> home, opening her <HI>heart,</HI> and not every heart,
(shewing what free grace is against the <HI>Popish</HI> and
<HI>Arminian</HI> and <HI>Foxians</HI> exalting of <HI>Cursed Nature</HI>)
and then it was that she being by the Lord turned,
<PB N="59" REF="35">
she turned to attend &amp; apply to her soul the words
which were spoken by <HI>Paul,</HI> as a poor <HI>Rams-horn</HI>
made use of in the hand of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>Toward the end of the day <HI>VV. Edmondson</HI> fell
into a long <HI>Invective,</HI> how I had falsly slandered
the <HI>People of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fox|ians boast of their Number.</NOTE> not only in this place, but the
whole Body of the People of the <HI>Lord</HI> called <HI>Qua|kers</HI>
in all parts: For said he we are a great people,
many thousands in <HI>England,</HI> many thousands in
<HI>London,</HI> besides in <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and other
places, and <HI>N-England.</HI> And he and they said, hast
thou any more to say to make out thy <HI>Lyes</HI>
against them.</P>
<P>I Answered (as at other times) that the <HI>Papists</HI>
the common <HI>Protestants,</HI> the <HI>Iews</HI> and the <HI>Mahumi|tans</HI>
and <HI>Pagans, &amp;c.</HI> fited the world with their
<HI>Numbers,</HI> and yet we jointly opposed them in <HI>Relig|ious
matters</HI> notwithstanding their <HI>innumerable num|bers:</HI>
And as for more proof that they were not
<HI>True Quakers,</HI> and so truly <HI>Feariug and Tremb|ling</HI>
before <HI>God,</HI> I told them I would produce an
Argument, that they were so far from being <HI>Christ|ians,</HI>
that they were a to be <HI>exploded</HI> and <HI>abhorred</HI>
of all <HI>Mankind,</HI> as being fallen beneath the com|mon
<HI>temper</HI> and <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>Humanity</HI> of men
and women, yea of the Savage and <HI>Barbarous</HI> in
the world, <HI>viz.</HI> their stripping <HI>stark naked</HI> their
<HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women</HI> and <HI>Maidens</HI> and passing along in
publick places and <HI>Streets</HI> unto the <HI>Assemblyes of
Men</HI> and <HI>Youths</HI> and so were beheld and gazed
upon by them! and this under a pretence of being
stirred up by God as a <HI>Service</HI> or <HI>Worship</HI> unto
<PB N="60" REF="36">
God, as an act of <HI>Christian Religion</HI> proceeding from
the immediate moving of the most holy <HI>Spirit of
God,</HI> most glorious in purity, and purity and holi|ness
it self.</P>
<P>At first <HI>W. Edmundson</HI> seemed to make strange
of the matter as if it could not be proved that any
of their women should so appear in the <HI>Assemblyes</HI>
of People.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two of the Foxian women na|ked in <HI>New England.</HI></NOTE> I told them the matter of <HI>fact</HI> was so
<HI>notorious</HI> that it would be loss of time and <HI>Impudence</HI>
to question it, being so fouly and openly <HI>practised</HI>
both in <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>39] Also I added further, that <HI>G. Bishop</HI> of <HI>Bris|tow,</HI>
one of themselves, in the second part of the
<HI>Persecutions of New-England,</HI> relates in print the
names of two women in <HI>N-England</HI> that did so
practice: and he complains of <HI>N-England Perse|cution</HI>
because those women suffered <HI>Whipping for</HI>
those actions by the <HI>Courts</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> of <HI>N-Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Iohn Burnet</HI> said that the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI>
were a People known to abhor all <HI>Impurity</HI> and
Uncleanness and the <HI>Appearance</HI> of it, and if any
of their women should so practice, they should
condemn it in them, yet nevertheless if it should
please the <HI>Lord God</HI> to stir up any of his <HI>Daughters</HI>
so to appear as a <HI>Sign</HI> and <HI>Testimony</HI> against the
<HI>Nakedness</HI> of others, they durst not condemn it.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> said, that they did condemn all im|modest
<HI>Appearances</HI> in women, both in <HI>Behaviour</HI>
and <HI>Gestures.</HI> But if God stirred them up and com|manded
them to this service to discover the <HI>Naked|ness</HI>
of others, they could not but acknowledge
<PB N="61" REF="36">
<HI>Gods</HI> hand, and submit to it: And he further added,
that it was a great <HI>Cross</HI> to a sober womans spirit
so to act, as well as an affliction and suffering to
her body.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> likewise alleadged the <HI>Prophet Isaiah,</HI>
(as also did <HI>W. E.</HI>) and the <HI>Sign</HI> of the Prophet <HI>Eze|kiel:</HI>
and <HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> read the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>Isa.</HI> where
<HI>Isaiah</HI> was commanded to goe <HI>naked</HI> for a <HI>Sign</HI> to
the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Ethyopians,</HI> to prophesie and de|nounce
that they also should go naked with their
buttocks uncovered as the words are: and this is
(said they) a proof that the People of the Lord
might be stirred up by <HI>God</HI> to such actions for <HI>Signs</HI>
unto others.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 20 <HI>dis|cussed touching</HI> Nakedness</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>I Answered,</HI> that this was in the dayes of <HI>Fig|ures</HI>
and <HI>Signs,</HI> Shadows and <HI>Ceremonyes:</HI> And
though this was <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Answer (in his Book
which I had there by me) yet <HI>G. Fox</HI> throughout
all this his Book in <HI>Folio,</HI> turns of the Allegations
and Arguments of many of his <HI>Opposites</HI> with this
Answer, <HI>to wit, The</HI> Substance <HI>is come, the</HI> Body <HI>is
come,</HI> Christ <HI>the</HI> End <HI>of the</HI> Law, <HI>the</HI> End <HI>of the</HI>
Command, <HI>the</HI> End <HI>of the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>the</HI> End <HI>of the</HI>
Prophets, <HI>and of all</HI> Signs <HI>and</HI> Shadows <HI>and</HI> Figures.</P>
<P>2. Although it were so threatned that the <HI>Ethi|opians</HI>
and <HI>Egyptians</HI> should so goe <HI>totally</HI> and <HI>stark
Naked,</HI> and that <HI>Isaiah</HI> did so, which is much ques|tioned:
yet it is not to be questioned but that the
<HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Ethiopians</HI> in their flight, would
cover [40] their <HI>Secret parts</HI> with the first cloaths
or raggs they could get, as it is no question but the
Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> did.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="37">
3. The difference of <HI>Nakedness</HI> of <HI>Mankind</HI> and
<HI>Womankind</HI> is very great in all <HI>Nations.</HI> The <HI>Sex</HI>
of <HI>Women</HI> is more fitted and framed by God for a
<HI>Covering,</HI> for <HI>Retiredness</HI> and keeping at home and
for <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Bashfulness;</HI> nor do we ever read
that ever God commanded such a thing to Women,
or that ever it came into his heart, or that ever any
<HI>Godly Woman</HI> did so practice: there is no shadow
or colour of <HI>Proof</HI> from the holy <HI>Scripture,</HI> nor from
any <HI>Civill</HI> and sober People, no nor from the naked

yet cover they their <HI>Females</HI> from their birth: Tis

some <HI>Savage bruits</HI> go so, but they are <HI>Canibals,

<P>They still answered, that they would not <HI>Coun|tenance</HI>
any such <HI>Practice</HI> but if the <HI>Lord God</HI> so
commanded his <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Daughters</HI> it must be
obeyed.</P>
<P>I demanded of them how it should be known
that it was the voice and command of <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>God</HI>
of <HI>Holiness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The true voice of God, and many false and pre|tended.</NOTE> and not the command of the unclean
<HI>spirit?</HI> for I told them that under that Cover that
one of them might be so commanded, and sent of
God in such a posture and behaviour amongst men,
why might not ten or twenty, yea all the women
in this present <HI>Assembly</HI> be so stirred up as it were
by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God</HI> to the horror and amazement
of the whole <HI>Countrey</HI> yea of the whole <HI>World?</HI></P>
<P>They seemed to me to be <HI>Confounded</HI> with this

Argumnet and weary to hear of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iate Inspira|tions and Revela|tions.</NOTE> and not willing to

that it was true in former Dispensations. The Com|mand
of God came to <HI>Abraham</HI> to kill his own
Child, his son <HI>Isaac,</HI> and this fact enjoined him did
seem as horrible <HI>unnatural</HI> and <HI>cruel,</HI> as this <HI>Naked|uess</HI>
of the Women unwomanly and <HI>unnatural.</HI> But,</P>
<P>1. It was in the day and dispensation of such
wonderfull <HI>Signs</HI> and figurative teachings unto men.</P>
<P>And 2. I said <HI>God</HI> did furnish them with a Spir|it
of discerning the <HI>true</HI> dream from the false, the
true voice from the false, the voice of <HI>God</HI> from the
voice of <HI>Sathan:</HI> But in our day wherein God had
altered his Dispensations and Revelations which
he [41] used to the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and had spoken to us
by his <HI>Son,</HI> and had left his mind both in the <HI>old</HI>
and <HI>new Scriptures</HI> or Writings: We have the ex|ample
and President of the <HI>Lord Iesus,</HI> that is, to
attend to the holy <HI>Scriptures</HI> only, and to use the
weapon of <HI>[It is written it is written]</HI> against <HI>Sa|thans</HI>
immediate <HI>Inspirations</HI> and temptations.</P>
<P>Here <HI>W. Edmondson</HI> fel into a great heat against
me and said that I spoke <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> in saying that
<HI>Abraham</HI> and the <HI>Saints</HI> then had a way and Spirit
of discerning the Spirits which we had not, imply|ing
that Gods Spirit was not the same: He added,
that I had kept them long and had proved nothing,
and yet we had not done with the first <HI>Position.</HI> I
replyed, that I had produced such <HI>Grounds</HI> as should
never be shaken, and that I presumed did appear to
the <HI>Consciences</HI> of many, and I heartily desired might
also appear unto their Spirits, Soules, and <HI>Consci|ences.</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="38">
Some of the Auditors spake to this Purpose,

<HI>That their Christ was not the true Lord Iesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>44] Here I prayed their patience to suffer me to
tell them that they were not <HI>Christians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning true &amp; false Christs</NOTE> nor Profes|sors
of <HI>Christian Religion:</HI> They might (with <HI>Iewes

they could not be: but as the true Lord Jesus told
us, many <HI>false Christ</HI> and <HI>false Prophets</HI> should come,

declare that for their parts they had cut of the head
of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> the true <HI>Lord Iesus
Christ,</HI> and they had set up a false <HI>Christ,</HI> a false
<HI>King,</HI> an <HI>Usurper</HI> in his stead, they had like <HI>Michal</HI>
put a wooden <HI>Image</HI> upon a pillow of goats hair in

<HI>David,</HI> the true Lord Jesus Christ was not to be

<P>My proof was, <HI>First.</HI> Because the <HI>Description</HI> and
<HI>Character</HI> which the holy Scripture gives to the
<PB N="69" REF="40">
true <HI>Lord Iesus,</HI> no way agrees with the <HI>Image</HI>
which they have set up. I told them that it was

<P>2. As to his humane <HI>Nature</HI> and being a man
and <HI>One Man Moses</HI> and the Prophets wrote of him:
of his <HI>Mother a Virgin,</HI> of the place of his birth
<HI>Bethlehem,</HI> of his bringing up at <HI>Nazareth:</HI> of his

of a <HI>Christ</HI> made up of the <HI>Godhead</HI> and their <HI>flesh,</HI>
I said they had set up a Christ within them which
was but an <HI>Imagination,</HI> an Image, a Christ in the
mystical <HI>Notion:</HI> but in reality <HI>Nothing:</HI> For as the

saith he is <HI>Christs Vicar</HI> and <HI>Lieftenant,</HI> and he doth
all for <HI>Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Iesuites</HI> (soaring above all
<HI>Christians</HI>) pretend the name <HI>Iesus,</HI> and yet the <HI>Pro|testant

respects the <HI>Papists</HI> are infinitely against both <HI>Christ</HI>
and <HI>Iesus,</HI> and so are not <HI>Christians</HI> but <HI>Antichrist|ians:</HI>
so I told them did they, they blew a <HI>Trumpet</HI>
for <HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> God in Man, the everlasting Father,
that we are <HI>bone</HI> of his bone and <HI>flesh</HI> of his flesh,
that he was so born at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> and dyed at <HI>Ierusa|lem
&amp;c,</HI> And yet all these fair <HI>Flourishes</HI> and Col|ours
are but as an <HI>English Flag</HI> in a <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI>
or any other Enemies Bottome: For do not all their
Books declare that <HI>Christ is Spiritual,</HI> that <HI>Christ,
God and Man is within us, that his Birth, his Life, his
Death, his Burial, his Resurrection, his Ascension are
wrought within us,</HI> so that like the <HI>Oracles</HI> of <HI>Apollo,</HI>
and the <HI>Ecchoes</HI> of the <HI>Iesuites</HI> the <HI>Quakers</HI> say
<HI>Christ was born at Bethlehem</HI> and dyed at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI>
but intend in truth and reallity no other <HI>birth</HI> nor
<HI>life</HI> nor <HI>death &amp;c.</HI> but what may be extant and
wrought in the heart of man.</P>
<P>To this purpose I told them that <HI>Humphrey Nor|ton</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hum|phrey Nor+ton</HI> deales plainly against the Person of Christ</NOTE>
(one that blew the <HI>Trumpet</HI> and beat up the

<P>I told them I acknowledged <HI>Christ</HI> within as
much as any of them, &amp; infinitely more, for I did
confess that every believing soul did bring home

<PB N="72" REF="42">

<P>I told them that (as the holy Scripture saith)
they preached not <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> but <HI>Themselves,</HI> yea
they preached the <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> to be <HI>Themselves:</HI>
that whatever were their Pretencse (as the <HI>Papists</HI>)
of <HI>God &amp; Christ &amp; Holiness &amp; Mortification,</HI> yet
they held not the <HI>Head</HI> (as the Scripture speaks) and

true Sun, but the picture of the <HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Righteous|ness.</HI></P>
<P>I told them they set up this <HI>Christ</HI> within, oppo|site
to <HI>Christ</HI> without, as <HI>Opposites &amp; Contraryes,
Denying &amp; Destroying</HI> one an other: for as it is with
a <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Palace,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ winhin and Christ without.</NOTE> if his <HI>person</HI> be without, his
<HI>person</HI> at that time is not within, though he be

Person be within the Palace at that time it is not
without. But the most clear Truth is though
these subtle <HI>Foxians</HI> sometimes speak of a Christ
without that dyed at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> agreeing with the
Christ within, yet they presently declare their mean|ing
to be <HI>Mystical:</HI> For ask them but these two
<HI>Questions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Ques|tions to Quakers.</NOTE> and if they make any <HI>Answer</HI> you will see
the <HI>Cheat,</HI> the <HI>Equivocotion</HI> and the <HI>Mistery of Ini|quity</HI>
in it.</P>
<P>1. Do they not hold the <HI>Light</HI> within every
man to be <HI>All,</HI> to <HI>doe All</HI> and to <HI>suffer All</HI> within
which the Christ without, <HI>Is</HI> or <HI>Did</HI> or <HI>suffered</HI>
without.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="42">
2. Ask them now what is become of this <HI>Man,</HI>
this person that thus suffered at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and they
are forced to confess he [47] is within, and can give

<HI>Newport</HI> the last day of the Conference.</P>
<P>But to return, I told them what I said I would
prove out of their <HI>Writings,</HI> and especially out of

and as it was thought by <HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> present.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn Burnet</HI> declared not, (nor any of them)
against what I spake: but said (as said the rest) if <HI>G.

they were willing I should produce out of <HI>G.
Fox</HI> his Book what I could that might make for
my proof, <HI>viz.</HI> That they did not profess the <HI>true
Christ.</HI></P>
<P>I said <HI>G: Fox</HI> had pickt out some particular Lines,
Sayings &amp; Sentences out of the Books and Writings
of his <HI>Opposites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">x</HI> his Book in Fo|lio pro|duced. Page 3.</NOTE> (it is not to be questioned but to
his utmost <HI>Advantage,</HI> as knowing best how to
<HI>Answer</HI> what he chose and <HI>cull'd</HI> out) and since they
were free and willing, I would produce some In|stances:
I took up the Book and read in the 3d. <HI>page,</HI>
where he brings in his <HI>Opposite Samuel Eaton</HI> saying
[The Saints have not Christ in the <HI>Flesh]</HI> G. F. his
Answer is <HI>[Contrary to</HI> Christ and the Apostles
<Q><HI>Doctrine, who said they were of his</HI> Flesh, <HI>and of his</HI>
Bone, <HI>and should eat his</HI> Flesh, <HI>and they that eat his</HI>
Flesh <HI>have it in them.]</HI></Q> Whence I affirmed that
Christ Jesus had such a Body as might be really and
materially in the Saints, and ii was clear that they
<PB N="74" REF="43">
were one with the <HI>Papists</HI> in their Sayings and
<HI>Doctrines</HI> denying the Flesh, Body and Person of
Christ Jesus: For as the <HI>Papists</HI> in stead of a <HI>Sprit|ual</HI>
feeding upon his <HI>bloud</HI> and Merits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa|pists &amp; Quakers destroy the Person of Christ.</NOTE> they sub|stitute
and bring in a <HI>Real, Material</HI> and Carnal, in
their horrible and fantastical <HI>Transubstantiation;</HI> so
do the <HI>Quakers</HI> professing to eat Christ <HI>spiritually,</HI>
wholy destroy his <HI>material</HI> and fleshly being.</P>
<P><HI>I proceeded saying, in the</HI> 4th Page G. Fox <HI>brings
in the same Opposite saying,</HI> The Saints do not see
<HI>Christ, the Heavens contain him. And</HI> G. F. <HI>Ans|wers</HI>
<Q>And the <HI>Apostle</HI> saith they sate with <HI>Christ</HI>
in <HI>heavenly places:</HI> so he is contrary to the <HI>Apostle,</HI>
and <HI>Christ</HI> was in them and walked in them, and <HI>God</HI>
dwelt in them and <HI>Christ</HI> in you except you be Repro|bates.</Q>
<HI>I said that as the</HI> Papists <HI>were up</HI> ridicu|lously

<P>48] For if the Heavens do contain that Man Christ
Jesus bodily, (as they grant in word) saying They
believed he <HI>dyed, rose,</HI> and <HI>ascended:</HI> then in that
same sence and respect the Saints cannot now sit
bodily with Christ in heavenly places, and there|fore
to alledge <HI>Christ</HI> within, and their sitting with
<HI>Christ</HI> in heavenly places, was but irrational <HI>Non|sence</HI>
and Jesuitical <HI>Equivocation:</HI></P>
<P>The truth is they were gravel'd with these <HI>Con|siderations,</HI>
and they were willing that <HI>G Fox</HI> his
book and his Answers should answer for them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers endure not trying but are willingly ignorant.</NOTE> and
although the oppositions of <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Opposites
<PB N="75" REF="43">
were mighty, and <HI>G Foxes</HI> were meer simple <HI>bark|ings</HI>
of dogs or foxes compar'd with the rational
and prudential Answers of a man, yet when I be|gan
to open and compare the <HI>Assertions</HI> of the
Opposite and <HI>Fox</HI> his answer, they would cry out
(especially <HI>W E.</HI> like a <HI>galled horse</HI> winching) <HI>Why
dost thou make thy</HI> Observations <HI>upon</HI> G. Fox <HI>his
words?</HI> G. Fox <HI>his words need not thy</HI> Expositions, <HI>let</HI>
G. Fox <HI>his words alone they are able to speak for them|selves.</HI></P>
<P>I told them it was a senceless business for me to
alleadge, (and they to be willing I should) <HI>G. Fox</HI>
his sayings and his <HI>Answers,</HI> and we should not de|bate
and discuss the <HI>Sence,</HI> and I make out my Proof
out of <HI>G. Fox</HI> his words, and his <HI>Adversaryes</HI> com|par'd
together: when they had spoken they knew
their liberty to take of my <HI>Answers</HI> with their own,
and leave what was spoke to every ones Conscience
in the sight of God.</P>
<P>They were <HI>Obstinately</HI> (that is in <HI>Greek Hereti|cally</HI>)
resolved to avoid this Course,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Willing Ignorance.</NOTE> therefore I was

<P>Reply. This ignorant and simple Cavil (as I

that is the <HI>first Adam,</HI> but Christ Jesus is of the

and <HI>Reprobates.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 13. Opened of Christs Humanity.</NOTE> But amongst all the most full and

Death and Blood-shedding of this Jesus (lit|erally

and lazie Ignorance: Let therefore (as it follows)
the Proud Despisers wonder and perish, believing

<P>In Page 37. He brings in <HI>Thomas Collier</HI> saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tho. Col|lier</NOTE>
<HI>[If the very Christ God Man be within those called

hath revealed his Son in me saith the <HI>Apostle,</HI> and
know you not that Christ is in you except you be
<HI>Reprobates:</HI> and the Spirit of the <HI>Father</HI> speaks in
you, and see how contrary thou art to the <HI>Prophets,
Christ</HI> and the <HI>Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>I urged that here <HI>G. Fox</HI> did plainly deny the
expected personal coming of the <HI>Lord Iesus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The second coming of the Lord Iesus</NOTE> but
they charged me to give none of my <HI>Sences</HI> and
<HI>Meanings</HI> to <HI>G. Fox</HI> his words: but now I have
leave (by Gods merciful hand) here to say, that
their <HI>Hypocrisie</HI> and <HI>Deceit</HI> (whereby they cheat
themselves and others) is so much the more gross
and abominable, because they pretend in words to
own Christ Jesus <HI>Humane descending,</HI> or <HI>Ascending</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="53">
as a Man into Heaven, and Christs there abiding

contrary to the <HI>Prophets, Christ, &amp; the Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>61] It comes to my mind that in reading &amp; urging
some of these Passages concerning these <HI>Foxians</HI>
denying the <HI>Humane Nature</HI> and <HI>Person</HI> of the <HI>Lord
Iesus,</HI> one of my Opposites <HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> insisted upon
that 9. of <HI>Isaiah</HI> where Christ is called the <HI>Ever|lasting
Father:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ever|lasting Fath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r Christ I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">su. &amp; how</NOTE> and yet he said, <HI>He was the Son of

and spreading of Christs Name, and the mighty
increase of his Spiritual Seed (as the Lord promised
to <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac</HI>) as the Stars of Heaven.
<HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> said the <HI>Hebrew word</HI> was <HI>[Abi Haad,</HI>
&amp;c.] and it was rendred <HI>Pater Eternitatis:</HI> I replied
that it was rendred (and that more near the <HI>He|brew)
Pater seculi,</HI> or <HI>seculorum:</HI> But I told him it
was not a seasonable time and place for him and
me to spend much time about the Translation of
the word:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers won|derfully changed &amp; yet but in Dissimula|tion as to learning &amp; the Scriptures</NOTE> he said he had brought the <HI>Hebrew Bi|ble</HI>

my self and better too: I was about to say that they
were wonderfully altered and changed from their
former principles and practises, for heretofore they
<PB N="96" REF="54">
have professed to me that they had no need of
Books, no not of the Scripture it self, for they had
the Teacher within them that gave forth Scripture,
&amp;c. if now they were perswaded to study the Holy
Scripture and the Translation of it, and to examine
the Translations and the Copies of them, then they
did err and sin before, (which they say the Saints can|not)
in so wonderfully neglecting and slighting
them as useless and needless things.</P>
<P>Yea the truth is if their Light be so Alsufficient
as they make it, to bring them to Heaven, to guide
them immediately and infallibly &amp;c. what sim|plicity
is it in them to stoop to <HI>Pen and Ink,</HI> and
mens fallible Translations, yea, many wayes charged
with many failings.</P>
<P>I know their Pretences of becoming <HI>All to All</HI>
to win the more, and of removing the offence and
stumbling block, <HI>viz.</HI> as if they denied the Scrip|tures,
but the truth is, they look at the <HI>Holy Scrip|tures</HI>
still but as the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> which the <HI>Apostles</HI>
dispensed with for a season: they care no more for
the Scriptures then the <HI>Papists</HI> do, they are forced
to make use of them for an end, but all their hope
is in their <HI>Interpretations,</HI> which both <HI>Papists and

he rose up and fell into a downright <HI>Speech</HI> or <HI>Ser|mon</HI>
to the <HI>People</HI> and <HI>Auditory:</HI> and first he de|clared
how notoriously I had wronged them, in

they had been so long patient towards me and suf|fer

but <HI>G. Fox</HI> his words cleared him from all my un|just

the People, how willing they had shewed them|selves
to own the Scriptures, and to have all their
Tea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hings and Differences tried by the Scriptures.
4. He fell upon the two Hinges of all the Qua|kers
common Discourses.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> An Invective against the <HI>Priests, False
Teacher, False Apostles,</HI> who had got on the <HI>Sheeps
cloathing,</HI> and sold the words of <HI>Scripture</HI> for their
<HI>Game</HI> and <HI>Lucre</HI> and he amplified this much how

or <HI>Benifice</HI> of 50. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> 100. or 200 pounds a year
(more or less) and he that complained how I took
up time, now (tediously) made us all to hear a Sto|ry,
which he said he knew himself of one of the
Priests that lived not many miles from the place
where <HI>W. Edmund.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Ed|mund.</HI> his story concerning Benefices</NOTE> lived, who told with his own
Mouth unto <HI>William Edmund.</HI> viz. how that having
a good <HI>Benefice,</HI> another <HI>Priest</HI> of his acquaintance
<PB N="98" REF="55">
came to visit him, whom he entertained kindly, and
this his Guest told him, that he was going to the
<HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Dublin,</HI> who was his Friend: and the
<HI>Priest</HI> the <HI>Host</HI> was afterward informed that this
treacherous and ungrateful Guest, did use all the
art he could with the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Durham</HI> (or <HI>Dublin</HI>)
to get his Friends (that had entertained him) his
Living from him.</P>
<P>2. The second part of his Sermon was (as usually
it is of all their Sermons) an extolling and magni|fying
of that Light which [63] he said had ap|peared
to him, which he advanced as the Principle
and the Foundation, the Light, &amp;c. he added how
they had left all the Glory and Pleasures of the
World for this Light:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And his vain extol|ling of their Idol <HI>Light</HI></NOTE> and how they had endured
and suffered much for Preaching this Light to un|godly
and ungrateful men, who had ill requited
them: for their Message and Work was only to
bring good News unto them, to tell them that they
should be free from sin and have Christ Jesus live
and dwell in them. I kept silence until this famous
<HI>Apostle</HI> and <HI>Preacher</HI> of <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> had done this
Speech or Sermon which he said <HI>he</HI> was moved in
his heart to make unto them &amp; (as he often said) to
give an account of his Faith which he performed
with very great zeal and fervency, both of mind
and body.</P>
<P>I had thought then to have spoke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John Stubs</HI> his sermon</NOTE> but imme|diately
<HI>Io. Stubs</HI> stood up being moved (as he said)
to Declare his mind and Thoughts unto the peo|ple
also, and so he began a large <HI>Oration, Speech</HI> or
<HI>Sermon</HI> also (though not so long as <HI>William Ed|mundsons</HI>)
<PB N="99" REF="55">
he declared how pleasant a thing the
Light was, and how pleasant a thing it was to be|hold
it? And he said, <HI>are you angry because we bring
you the Tidings of the Light?</HI> This was the principle,
this was the <HI>Foundation</HI> of all, the <HI>Light, &amp;c.</HI> He
<HI>added</HI> (for <HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> his was but <HI>a</HI> Repetition of
<HI>William Edmundsons</HI> his <HI>Sermon</HI>) that they had for|saken
all the Glory of Honours and Pleasures of

Travels and to many Hardships and Sufferings for
the <HI>Light</HI> sake: I heard him also patiently and
gave him no <HI>Interruption</HI> (as he twice openly con|fest
that I had not interrupted them: but when he
had finished his <HI>Sermon</HI> and I had gained a little
calm and liberty of Speech, immediately before I
could finish one Sentence; that <HI>Pragmatical and In|sulting

they were set down, and common Reason
said that it was my turn to speak, and every body
desired what Answer I could frame to hear it, that
then I should be <HI>disturbed</HI> and <HI>stopt</HI> was no way be|fitting
the Societies of Civil and Morral men: I
then Answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A short Answer to 2 Sermons</NOTE> that those very <HI>Sermons</HI> or <HI>Orations</HI>
which they had now made to the People were so
far beneath the merit of an Answer to them, that
they ministred and afforded to me a mighty and
invincible <HI>Argument,</HI> that the Spirit of God [64] was
not the <HI>Author of them:</HI> For we all knew that the
<HI>Spirit of God</HI> was most purely <HI>Rational,</HI> and a <HI>Spirit</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="56">
of pure <HI>Order,</HI> and did not prompt or move men
to break <HI>Hedges</HI> and leap over one <HI>Ordinance</HI> into

to fall upon our knees and Answer an <HI>Argument</HI>
with a <HI>Prayer</HI> (as it is a frequent practice with the
<HI>Quakers,</HI>) is it proper to break off <HI>Prayer</HI> and fall
to disputing, or out of Disputation into <HI>Preaching?</HI></P>
<P>But I said my Opposites Spirit was far from the
<HI>Holy Spirit of God:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e Qua|kers not or|derly nor patient</NOTE> and his movings are far from
the <HI>Motions</HI> with which my <HI>Antagonists</HI> were acted,
for they had neither power to keep civil Order,
nor to be patient, for not being able to answer nor
bear my words <HI>W. Edmundson</HI> said expresly what
should we sit here and suffer him to vent his <HI>Blas|phemies
and Lies?</HI> he hath kept us here two dayes,
and have proved nothing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I took a little boldness and told them, that if
<HI>Paul</HI> himself were present, or <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> himself
in their bodily presence which they confessed he
<HI>died</HI> in at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> yet they would say unto them,
even unto Christ himself, thou hast falsely <HI>charged</HI>
but thou hast proved nothing: <HI>Paul</HI> himself should
be an Enemy, and Jesus Christ should be a <HI>Blas|phemer</HI>
and a <HI>Beelzebub</HI> because he brought glad
news of the Truth from Heaven to them.</P>
<P>I further said, that I had more to offer in the
name and in the cause of the true Lord Jesus
Christ, and after I had got liberty of speech, I said
that as they which <HI>denied</HI> the person of the true

<P>They <HI>demanded</HI> of me wherein <HI>they denied the
offices of Christ Iesus:</HI> I Answered, <HI>I had many
things to declare in which they denied the</HI> Offices
<HI>of Christ Iesus</HI> (as well as the <HI>Papists</HI> for which we
seperated from them as <HI>Antichristans,</HI> not holding
the Head the true Lord Jesus the <HI>Sacrifice and Sacri|ficer,</HI>
the only <HI>Prophet, Apostle</HI> and <HI>Messenger,</HI> bring|ing

(some of them) <HI>the Pope</HI> and (some of them) <HI>the

mind in the <HI>Holy Scriptures:</HI> and con- [65] trary
to the <HI>Quakers</HI> who set up a voice or motion within
them over topping and over pouring the voice of
Christ Jesus in the Scriptures, some of them main|taining
that this <HI>Light</HI> within them is that <HI>great
Prophet</HI> that was to come which <HI>Moses</HI> Prophesied
of, <HI>Deut.</HI> 18.</P>
<P>I said I would contract my thoughts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King+ly office of the Lord Iesus.</NOTE> and speak at
present only a little of his <HI>Kingly power and Office,</HI>
and I plainly denounced that they were all notori|ously
guilty of <HI>High Treason</HI> against the King of
Kings, the Lord Jesus, yea as far as in them lay,
they robd him of his Crown, and Life and All.</P>
<P>In particular I told them I had abundant proof
there ready to bring forth from <HI>G. Foxes</HI> Book, that
he and his Associates denied (yea all of them) that
visible Kingdome and <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Institutions</HI> which
<PB N="102" REF="57">
he as <HI>King</HI> over all his <HI>Subjects</HI> hath <HI>Sovereign Right</HI>
unto, and most faithfully and wisely ordained to
continue until his coming again.</P>
<P>I told them that <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Book and all their
Books and Professions denied any visible Church
of Christ at all:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The visi|ble Chris|tian Church &amp; Ordi|nances.</NOTE> and though they maintained and
kept up <HI>Congregations</HI> (of pretended Christan) <HI>Wor|ships</HI>
and <HI>Worshippers</HI> (in a direct contradiction unto
their own Tenents, yet) they maintained the
Church was in God and so not visible: the Officers
of the Church were invisible and immediately
made by the immediate and invisible Spirit. The
<HI>Baptisme</HI> was within, and only the <HI>Baptisme</HI> of the
<HI>Spirit</HI> and of <HI>Fire:</HI> The <HI>Lords Supper</HI> appointed
by the Lord Jesus to be a Spiritual Feast remem|bring
him until his coming was with them nothing
else but Spiritual joy, which they have one in and
with another, which they have by the second com|ing
of the Lord Jesus to them, who they said was
come again to the Apostles the second time, and
unto themselves also.</P>
<P>Upon this (as I remember) there fell out some
words between my Opposites, and some of the
people called <HI>Baptists:</HI> But some of them (especi|ally
<HI>Iohn Stubs</HI>) demanded of me, why I thus
charged them and was my self so guilty, not liv|ing
in <HI>Church Ordinances</HI> my self.</P>
<P>I Answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Touching the several Churches extant.</NOTE> that it was one thing to be in Arms

<P>After all my search and examinations and con|siderations
I said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Churches nearest to Christ Iesus</NOTE> I do profess to believe, that some
come nearer to the <HI>first primitive Churches,</HI> and the
<HI>Institutions</HI> and <HI>Appointments</HI> of Christ Jesus then

<PB N="104" REF="58">
I doe not remember that any <HI>Reply</HI> was made
to this by any of my <HI>Opposites,</HI> nor heard I any
more of this <HI>Objection.</HI></P>
<P>I now praied there<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">"<HI>their.</HI>"R. W. Ms. Ann.</NOTE> patience to hear me a few
words: I said we had spent two whole dayes from
morning to night and had proceeded no further
then the Debates of the two first <HI>Positions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">My offer in the end of the second dayes con|ference</NOTE> I told
them if they were free I would attend them again
in the Morning (being the first of the week) to fall
upon the proof of my other five positions remain|ing
for <HI>Newport:</HI> or if they were not willing to
that, I would (if God permitted) attend them there
on the second day called <HI>Munday,</HI> in the Morning to
proceed upon the rest.</P>
<P><HI>W. Edmundson</HI> said, they had spent so much time
already upon but two of them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lying pre|tenders to Gods service</NOTE> and both he and
<HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> said they had other business in hand
then to attend unto my <HI>false Charges</HI> which in all
67] this time I could not make out: they said
they must go about the work of the Lord to which
he had called them.</P>
<P>I told them I had used all diligence, I failed not
to meet them about the exact hour appointed, and
alwayes before the audience was come. I never
withdrew nor absented a <HI>Minute,</HI> but put my old
<HI>Carcase</HI> to constant pursuit of my promise which
lay on me to fulfil, and to make out my proofs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors just Apolo|gie agai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st the unjust clamors of the Qua|kers</NOTE>
although they had spoke never a word until I had
finished: I used all possible brevetie, and oft times
suppressed my thoughts pressing in upon me for
<PB N="105" REF="58">
Utterance and Audience; I rather chose thus to
Apologize for my self, then down right to blame
them, on whom (they saw well enough) I laid the
blame of our long proceeding. I told them I had
spoken nothing to them but the <HI>Eternal truth</HI> of
God, which sooner or later would arrest them,
and using aloud the words of the Lord Jesus <HI>[viz.
The words that I have spoken shall judge you at the last
day.]</HI> I withdrew.</P>
<P>Within a quarter of an hour they sent one to
me to desire my coming in again to them, and
<HI>William Edmondson</HI> (commonly their proud mouth)
told me that I had deeply charged them and laid
many <HI>false Accusations</HI> upon them, and some of
them dangerous, both as they were <HI>Christians,</HI> and
as they were men: they had used long patience in
hearing of me, and yet because it should be seen
that they were willing to hear the utmost that I
had to say they would meet and spend a few hours
with me on the second Day following at <HI>nine in the
Morning,</HI> only they would not endure any long and
tedious Discourses.</P>
<P>I answered that their own souls knew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A mutual agreement for a third dayes con|ference.</NOTE> and the
<HI>Auditors</HI> knew I used to be brief: and if they had
pleased to have given me leave, I would have fin|ished
the whole seven by noon the first day: and I
would now promise them (by Gods help) to finish
what I had to say to the other five remaining in a
quarter of an hour, so that in five quarters of an
hour I would present them with what I had to say:
<HI>W. Edmundson</HI> said they would expect I should so do,
and all of them seemed well pleased that I offered
<PB N="106" REF="59">
to dispatch each Position in a quarter of an hour;
I said they must not count me false &amp; a <HI>Promise|breaker</HI>
if I was not exact to a quarter of an hour
possible I might be within a quarter, possible I
might something exceed it, but I hoped not to
exceed above a quarter.</P>
<P><HI>W. Edmundson</HI> replied, Nay <HI>Roger</HI> thou must be
punctual if [68] thou wilt be a Christian: and in|deed
afterward at <HI>Providence</HI> he unjustly more then
once upbraided me saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A quarter of an hour much can|vased.</NOTE> <HI>Is this your quarter of an
hour?</HI> I answered that Christians nor any prudent
man would be so curious and critical as to raise
Censures and Accusations upon the nicityes and un|certaintyes
of a few <HI>Minutes,</HI> for unless we had
Clocks and Watches and quarter-Glasses (as in some
Ships) it was impossible to be exactly punctual:
however by Gods help I said I would study such
<HI>Exactness,</HI> that I would rather omit much I had to
say then fail in my promise to them.</P>
<P>After this (as I heard) <HI>W Hitchcock</HI> of <HI>Newport</HI>
held dispute with them about Water-Baptisme, I
was withdrawn being evening and weary.</P>
<P>I was told by many of <HI>Providence,</HI> that I knew
them they would not stand a <HI>Disputation:</HI> or if
they did they would not continue without great
<HI>Advantages</HI> and be as slippery as <HI>Eeles,</HI> and break
off abruptly, as their spirit hurried them, I therefore
studiously endeavoured to tole and drive them to
the finishing of my remaining five at <HI>Newport,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers spirit &amp; policy</NOTE> and
the other seven at <HI>Providence.</HI> And thus by the
most wise and gracious hand of God we came to
the end of the second dayes work, and the second
Position and the end of the Week.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="59">
It was queried by some why (at <HI>Newport</HI> and
<HI>Providence</HI> afterward) they appointed the end of
the weeks for the <HI>Disputation?</HI> and why since it
was not finished they would not proceed on the
first day? It is not immaginable that they cordially
owne that day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers would not dispute on the first day and why.</NOTE> (for the <HI>Quakers</HI> work upon it) but
they wisely resolved to have the whole first day
with the People to make up their <HI>Breaches,</HI> stop

<HI>Agitations</HI> against their <HI>Consciences &amp; Credits.</HI> It
is dolefull that men of excellent parts, and of great

<P>69] THe third day of our <HI>Conference</HI> being come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third dayes con|ference at New-port</NOTE>
being the second of the Week as was ap|pointed,
<HI>W. Edmundson</HI> began and said to this effect,
<HI>Roger,</HI> we have waited upon thee two dayes already
to hear what thou hadst to say to prove thy false
<HI>Charges</HI> against us: we are here according to prom|ise
to spend some hours about the rest of the seven
which yet remain: we must tel thee that we will
not give thee leave to make a long work of it: if
according to thy promise thou wilt dispatch each
<PB N="108" REF="60">
af the other five in a quarter of an hour, we will
keep our promise and hear thee.</P>
<P>I knew it was in vain, (as in the other two dayes
past I found it) to insist upon their obstinately con|tinued
<HI>Advantage</HI> of three constantly engaged against
me (beside their accidental speakers who had lib|erty
when others were forbidden) I say notable and
<HI>Chief men</HI> in their way and <HI>Sect:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter sent in to all of us.</NOTE> and having just
then read a Letter as I sate there directed to my
self and all of us to be read in the <HI>Assembly,</HI> I be|gun
with presenting the Letter to them, and told
them that just now it was delivered to me <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I
knew not certainly from whome it came, nor of
one Tittle of the Contents of it: only I judged it
to be my Brother <HI>Robert Williams (School-Master</HI>
of <HI>Newport</HI>) his hand: I read the <HI>Superscription</HI>
and offered if they pleased to unseal and read it,
or I would deliver it into their hand so to doe.</P>
<P><HI>W. Edmundson</HI> answered that they came not
thither to hear <HI>Papers,</HI> but to hear how I would
make out my false <HI>Charges</HI> against them and this
he speaking none would whist against it, and this
he did speak because my Brother beyond my ex|pectation
and thoughts spake some words the first
morning against their <HI>Insulting</HI> and <HI>domineering</HI>
over me, as also delivered a paper to them which
was with much adoe handed and delivered to them
but never read, containing these two great <HI>Points</HI>
in every true penitent Converts eye, <HI>viz.</HI> the sight
of <HI>Sin as Sin.</HI> And 2. The sight of the material
<HI>Lord Iesus</HI> as the true <HI>Messiah</HI> or anointed, these
<PB N="109" REF="60">
were the two <HI>Daggers</HI> which they knew stab'd at
the heart of their feigned <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> within
them.</P>
<P>I knew my Brother patiently waited there the
two first dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Let|ter refused to be opened by the Qua|kers</NOTE> and was (with others) silenced: and
now I guessed he had sent them his mind and
would trouble them no more. I told them [70] the
whole <HI>Assembly</HI> had Interest in the Letter, as di|rected
to us to read to the rest.</P>
<P><HI>W. Edmundson</HI> and the rest desired the <HI>Auditors</HI>
to speak if they desired to have it read: some of
the <HI>Quakers</HI> said it might be read when the business
was over: so I to make no breach put it up, and
in the end of the day offered it again, claiming
their <HI>Promise,</HI> but they regarded it not, so that
after the <HI>Conference</HI> ended (we of <HI>Providence</HI> being
called away by a Boat preparing to depart) I stept
to my Brothers house and acquainted him with
Passages, who said that not only the <HI>Superscription</HI>
was his hand but the Letter also, and I might open
and read it, and (if it might be) present it to the
intended <HI>Assembly</HI> at <HI>Providence:</HI> of which we shall
hear when it pleaseth the mercifull hand of the
Lord to bring us to those Transactions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sum of the Letter</NOTE> In short,
it was refused there also, &amp; therefore I have judged
it fit, since it was so solemnly flung out both at
<HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Newport</HI> that it should have as sol|emn
a <HI>Publication</HI> to the whole world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My self reproved in the Letter in 3 par|ticulars</NOTE> and the
rather because it is a <HI>witness</HI> of Truth as to the
two first dayes transactions, impartially reproving
my <HI>Opposites</HI> and me also where he conceived we
were failing: It is true I am not of my Brothers
<PB N="110" REF="61">
<HI>Conscience</HI> as to the <HI>Discipline</HI> of Christ, <HI>viz.</HI> that I
ought to have admonished the <HI>Quakers</HI> in private,
before I had so publickly <HI>&amp;c.</HI> since they proclaimed
their sin like <HI>Sodom</HI> on the house top: and it is
preposterous to run from <HI>House-top-sins</HI> to closet
<HI>Concealments</HI> and <HI>Admonitions.</HI></P>
<P>2. Nor can I own the <HI>Quakers</HI> in their wayes
and worships to be Servants of the Lord (as my
Brother calls them) any more then the greedy
<HI>Wolves,</HI> devouring the souls of the <HI>Ephesians, Act.</HI>
20. were the meek and innocent <HI>Lambs</HI> and sheep
of Christ.</P>
<P>3. Nor doe I think I charged them too deep
or too sharply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ffer|ence of the Quakers</NOTE> as my Brother speaks: I knew the
<HI>Foxes</HI> and <HI>Wolves</HI> (the able Leaders amongst them)

but that some <HI>Lambs</HI> and <HI>Chickens</HI> of <HI>Christ Iesus</HI>
are carried away in their (Soul bloody) jaws also,
whom I beseech to remember themselves, and I
humbly beseech the God and Father of mercies
to pull them out, and help all that love his Name,
to help pull them out as <HI>Brands</HI> from the <HI>Eternal

Humbly desiring the reading of it to publick
Audience for the Truths sake of Christ Jesus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Letter it self.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>LOving Friends, though the Lord in his Wisdome
hath denied me from <HI>Nature</HI> the gift of utterance,
yet in his infinite mercy he hath vouchsafed to me his
free gift as to <HI>writing,</HI> whereby the private motions
arising between God and my own Soul (without
knowledge unto any) may be declared, being moved here|unto
out of a sensible sadness, which is upon my Spirit
in beholding the <HI>Cloudings</HI> and <HI>Vailings</HI> of the most
precious Truths of my Lord and Master <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI>
But <HI>(Loving Friends</HI>) herein mistake me not at first:
This is no charge nor discharge, but an appearance
unto my Soul, even unto the moving of my Bowels with|in
me: For my <HI>Beloved</HI> at his putting in his hand at
the hole of the door, when all my <HI>Lovers, Priests</HI> and
<HI>Elders</HI> gave up the Ghost in the City: (for gladness) is
taken away, and joy out of the pleasant field, and in
the Vineyard there is no (true) singing, and the <HI>Tread|ers</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="62">
tread out no (pure) Wine, for the Lord hath made
the <HI>Vintage</HI> shouting to cease: But to avoid Prolixity,
I write not to charge nor admonish, neither for <HI>con|tending
Argumentation,</HI> it being against my under|standing,
and as the taking of a <HI>Dog</HI> by the ear: But
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">incerely unto edification, in signifying the appearances
unto my Soul in what I have gotten from these your
so earnest and tedious <HI>Debates.</HI></P>
<P>72] Therefore I am humkly bold to speak, unto all the
contending Disputants in the plainness of my heart.</P>
<P>And <HI>First</HI> unto the <HI>Complaining Disputant</HI> it ap|pears
unto my Soul, that you have not dealt as a faith|ful
Servant of the Lord Iesus, with your fellow Ser|vants,
for you should have admonished them both first
and second time in private, and if they would not have
heard you then to have told it to the Church, the great
<HI>Congregation</HI> of God.</P>
<P>2. It doth appear unto my Soul, that you have
assumed and presumed too much, being so large and
high proposals, which do appear unto me not as charges,
but in this first Appearance as Proposals, until they
are maintained as charges by sufficient proof, wherein
they may be molified: But in truth herein I am at a
stand, for against whom were the true <HI>Apostles</HI> more
bitter than against the <HI>False?</HI> which if the <HI>Defend|ants</HI>
be so (which in charity I have reason to hope other|wise)
your Conscience will be more cleared in your Lord
and Masters service: yet know there may be a zeal
without true knowledge, therefore let true zeal appear
that is not in persecution, but for the Glory of God and
truths sake, as it is in Ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us.</P>
<P>2. Unto the <HI>Defending Complainants</HI> (the loving
<PB N="113" REF="62">
<HI>Quakers</HI>) which I pray take not as a charge, but as
appearances unto my Soul in that you never dealt faith|fully
in your Lord and Masters service, for both <HI>Com|plainants</HI>
and <HI>Defendants</HI> are all but Servants unto one
Lord and Master, and you must do that service which
is ordained by your <HI>Lord and Master</HI> to do in your seve|ral
stations (either in truth or falshood) there is no hind|ring
of it, and when you have done all you can, you are
but unprofitable Servants, falling short of your <HI>Lord
and Masters</HI> infinite Glory, and in the end of your ser|vice,
you shall as the Grasse wither, and as the Flower
fade, but unto our everlasting comforts the word of the
Lord shall stand and for ever.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That you have not done your Master faithful
service by assuming and presuming beyond the bounds of
<HI>Moderation</HI> and <HI>Christianity:</HI> but as I said before
take not these as charges, but as proceeding from your
own <HI>Expressions</HI> and <HI>Behaviours</HI> in your late actings
which have not been for that solid edification of the
<HI>Auditors</HI> which was expected but for defending and
advancing of self, which appeared:</P>
<P>1. By your limiting the Holy one of <HI>Israel,</HI> contrary
unto your <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Masters</HI> Commission.</P>
<P>2. By breaking an <HI>Apostolical Command</HI> (so far
as in you lay) as not to quench the Spirit.</P>
<P>73] 3. You have not dealt faithfully and Christian
like with your elder fellow servant, and then what
would you do with the Heir.</P>
<P>To the first appearance you would not begin before
you had stated by forced Covenant that none should
speak (though with leave in modesty and sobriety) but
those that would joyn issue with the complainant, and
<PB N="114" REF="63">
that under hand writing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">True lib|rety in|fringed</NOTE> And herein (loving friends)
you have infringed upon those great Liberties and Mer|cies
which God hath bestowed upon these parts, and
which you do enjoy, and cannot enjoy else where: And
will you now shut up your common Wine-presses that we
can have no fruit nor refreshing but what comes from
your private Presses? Know <HI>(Loving Friends</HI>) this
is a sad grievance that lies upon us. Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a, you do in|fringe
not only upon our Souls but upon our <HI>Temporal
Liberties.</HI></P>
<P>For in our Courts of Iudicature there is a funda|mental
liberty stated for any to speak freely for Con|science
sake in any Cause in the Bounds of Sobriety
and Modesty. But this appears against the Rules and
Practises of all <HI>Christianity,</HI> not practised by the
<HI>Judicial Convocation,</HI> nor by the high <HI>Commission
Court</HI> in our Native Couutry, where often I have been,
and the <HI>Metropolitan</HI> with the rest of the <HI>Bishops</HI> in
Gravity and Christianity (though their pleadings were
by Proctors, yet) gave liberty especially for Relations
to speak: As in one Instance of a person whom you
all have heard of, when he was to come upon Exami|nation,
his wife being big with Childe came with him,
the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> (though otherwise he might be im|proper,
yet herein shewd great civility by considering
the Womans condition, and gave liberty for speaking to
the full, with replying no discomfortable Words, yea in
Christianity delayed further prosecution until she was
delivered, though afterwards they acted their improper
persecution.</P>
<P>But into what a condition shall we be brought (I
hope not into an high <HI>Commission</HI> nor <HI>Inquisition
<PB N="115" REF="63">
Court</HI>) if this <HI>Imprimator</HI> goes on, that none shall
speak, no not so much as suffered to desire to speak,
though they are great with Childe with the Man
Christ Iesus: But I hope the People will see their
Liberties, and your selves know this was not the true
Apostles practises.</P>
<P>2. Your sad quenching of the Spirit when the mo|tion
of it arose in any for Soul-satisfaction in any to
speak,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quenching of the Spirit</NOTE> you would not suffer them to be expressed but
stifle them in their coming forth: O dear Friends con|sider,
you would not be so dealt with: For what did you
know but [74] the Lord might bring forth from any of
the Auditors for witnessing his <HI>Eternal Truth</HI> and
<HI>Glory?</HI> therefore as your Heavenly <HI>Master</HI> is bounti|fully
free, be not you Niggards in shutting up his Boun|ties
and suffring none to pass but through your own
Purses: I speak as the Apostle did after the manner of
men.</P>
<P>3. Your Indecorum Behaviours both in words and
gestures unto your elder <HI>Fellow-Servants</HI> &amp; aged <HI>Fa|ther</HI>
complaining as not performing your duty as young
men according unto Rule of honouring gray hairs&punc;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The insulting Spirit of the Quakers</NOTE></P>
<P>1. But by unseemly smiles of Derision, saying often
<HI>(for a time</HI>) Thou old Man, thou old Man, thereby
appearing to provoke to passion:</P>
<P>2. When that would not move his exceeding great
patience, then charging of him with Blasphemy, and to
prove his Blasphemy:</P>
<P>3. Again (not <HI>Apostle</HI> or Gospel like) seeking and
taking advantages against the Aged, and contrary to
Covenant by three or four baiting him at once, unto the
confounding of his memory, or stopping of his utterance,
<PB N="116" REF="64">
under the pretence of challenging all comers (when
reasons considers of coming in Order) But your de|fence
was that you were but one Man, then you should
have been but one Mouth.</P>
<P>Again your improper charging of the complainant
with mispending of time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true cause of our long dis|course at Newport</NOTE> when in Truth it was your
selves (in not suffering of him orderly to proceed) But
by your often <HI>Iterations, Tautologies, Indecorum
Behaviours</HI> and <HI>Expressions,</HI> with improper Preach|ments
at that time, and yet lay the defect upon the
aged, and would not be satisfied with his substantial
Proofs, divine Reasons and Argumental Demonstra|tions.
And herein your Conscience (if unsatisfied) had
liberty in timely Order, to have made your substantial
Desence, if patience had been suffered to have had her
perfect work. It is acknowledged by Auditors, that as
the Complainant brought substantial proof (for so far
as he proceeded) so you the Defendants also brought
substantial defence (in what was substantial) but now
who shall judge? ye will not suffer the Gospel rule,
that the standers by, the Spirits of the Prophets shall
judge. Then both of your own private Interpretations
doth aim to be judges, and so will be endless and true
judgeless: And by proceedings, the cause of Christ
Iesus (being now at stake) much dishonoured unto the
sadness of my Soul and unsatisfied Conscience, and also
the expectation of the Auditors which was for Soul-edi|fication
frustrated, and unto publick shame (as yet) only
self contendings hath the supream Appearance. There|fore
<HI>(Loving Friends) [75]</HI> pleading and defending
for your <HI>Lord and Masters sake,</HI> shew your selves

self-denial, Love, Charity, Tenderness, in bowels of

<HI>eternal and universal Righteousness,</HI> whose infinite

chufe and lay by: for I told them that according
to my promise, and their expectation I would pre|sent
them with the Substance of my proof of this
Position in the compass of about a quarter of an
hour.</P>
<P>76] I reminded them first of the nature of the
Word Spirit in Latine <HI>Spiritus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The word spirit</NOTE> in Greek <HI>Pneuma,</HI>
in the Hebrew <HI>Ruch</HI> and <HI>Ruach,</HI> signifying some|times
<HI>Breath,</HI> sometimes <HI>Wind,</HI> and from thence
applied unto God himself, unto Angels, unto Men,
as denoting a spiritual, powerful, invisible fine Sub|stance
distinct from flesh and earthly Bodies:
Hence God was said to be a Spirit, not properly
but that his Being was pure, powerful, invisible, &amp;c.</P>
<P>1, Whether God was properly a Spirit (as the
Quaker affirmed) we had some controversie at
<HI>Providence</HI> of which hereafter.)</P>
<P>2. Concerning Spirits, I observed two great
Sects: 1 Those of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> (who were ac|counted
the most Orthodox, Sound and right, hold|ing
such a Spiritual Substance in Angels and Spirits
and a Resurrection. 2. The Sadduces which held
neither Angel, nor Spirit, nor Resurrection, as at this
day, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="65">
3. It is clear there is a two-fold Spirit: 1. Holy
and pure:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The quality of Spirits</NOTE> such a Spirit is God himself, and the
Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father by the
Son, such are the Spirits of the Angels, the Spirits
of Gods Children in part, and the Spirits of just
men made perfect (the <HI>Quakers</HI> say here, we say in
the life coming.)</P>
<P>The other Spirit is a wicked Spirit, a lying and
a murtherous Spirit in Sathan and his Children, yet
often counterfeiting the Holy and pure Spirit, like
the Oile and Ointment which God prescribed and
forbad the like of it to be made on pain of death.
Therefore we are commanded not to believe every
Spirit, but to try even the very Spirits, not only of
men but of <HI>Doctrines, Churches, Religions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All spirits must be tried</NOTE> pretend|ing
the Name of God, (as do the <HI>Turks, Iews</HI> and
<HI>Christians</HI>) and of the Son of God, as do all the
Antichrists and Antichristians extant.</P>
<P>4. <HI>The Holy Spirit of God (being the</HI> seven
Lambs of Fire, the seven Eyes, and seven Horns, <HI>Rev.
5.</HI>) he is pleased to work variously.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> in an ordinary way of Regeneration and
Sanctification, &amp;c. common to all the lowest and
youngest of Gods Children, <HI>(Iohn 3. that which is
born of the Spirit is Spirit</HI>) Hence we read of the
Spirit of Prayer, and of Holiness wrought in the
Soul by the finger or power of God: so that the
knowledge of God, the fear, the love, the trusting
to and in God, the calling upon God is natural to
all Gods Children, <HI>Gal. 5. Abba Father,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>77] The second is extraordinary and immediate,
such as was pour'd upon the Lord Jesus, <HI>Isai.</HI> 11.
<PB N="120" REF="66">
such as Christ breathed upon the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and by
the <HI>Apostles</HI> hands upon others when they spake
with <HI>Tongues,</HI> fortelling things to come, and pen|ning
the Holy Scriptures or Records, as did the
Prophets of old, and the first Messengers the Apos|tles
of Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>I told them I had many things to say as to the
false Spirits of the false Christs, and false Prophets,
the Spirits of Devils as well as the Spirits of God
(in the <HI>Revelation</HI>) and the three wayes of deceit
mentioned, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2. by Spirit, by Word, or by
Letter: but I would contract my self, I say that their
Spirit by which they were acted was not Gods
Spirit.</P>
<P>1. Because the Holy Spirit of God was given by
means,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods Spirit given by Gods means</NOTE> but the <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended all along in
<HI>G. Fox</HI> and other Books, that their Spirit was im|mediate
or without means: I said in the <HI>8th</HI> of the
<HI>Romans</HI> was a <HI>Golden Chain</HI> of <HI>Gods Order</HI> or <HI>Method</HI>
of <HI>Working</HI> from <HI>Predestination</HI> to <HI>Glorification:</HI> In
the <HI>10th.</HI> to the <HI>Romans</HI> was a <HI>Golden Chain</HI> of the
<HI>Means appointed,</HI> &amp;c. How shall a Man be saved?
by calling upon God?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spirit of God working by means</NOTE> How shall he call on him
except he believe in him? how shall a Man be|lieve
in him except he hear of him? how shall
a Man hear of him except some Preach? how shall
a Man Preach except he be sent, &amp;c, Hence <HI>Peter</HI>
Preaching Christ Jesus to the first Converts, they
were some thousands brought to Christ, when they
were pierced to the heart, and cried out <HI>what shall
we do? Peter</HI> sends them nor to a light within
them, but bids them <HI>Repent and be Baptized,</HI> Act.
<PB N="121" REF="66">
14. <HI>Paul</HI> so spake that many believed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers at <HI>Newport</HI> appealed too pub|lickly</NOTE> <HI>Act.</HI> 16.
while <HI>Paul</HI> spake the Lord opened <HI>Lydias</HI> heart:
and I appealed to the Consciences of those called
<HI>Quakers</HI> at <HI>Newport</HI> there present, whether in a
contradiction this Spirit they now professed, de|scended
immediately upon them from God (as they
spake) or was not conveyed unto them by the Min|istry
of the former Preaching <HI>Quakers&punc;</HI> that came
unto them: so that these now are but the waterers
and confirmers of this Doctrine of the Spirit in
them.</P>
<P>2. As Believing and Conversion comes by hear|ing,
&amp;c. so these extraordinary gifts and powrings
forth of Gods Spirits was generally by means also:
Christ used Breathing upon the <HI>Apostles:</HI> the Spirit
of God descended, <HI>Act.</HI> 8. 19. in the laying on of
hands: in <HI>Peters</HI> Preaching, <HI>Acts.</HI> 10. the miracu|lous
Spirit of [78] <HI>Tongues</HI> and <HI>Prophecy</HI> descended
upon <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his company, and not before,
yea, and what is that waiting in silence used in pri|vate,
and in the publick Assemblies of the <HI>Quakers,</HI>
but a confessed means in which they wait for the
Spirit of God (as poor Souls they think) descending
on them.</P>
<P>I was then forced to omit the <HI>Allegations</HI> out of
<HI>G. Fox</HI> his book then by me and ready, but I will
now recite a few of them.</P>
<P>In page 6. of this Book in Folio, <HI>G. Fox</HI> brings

<P>Again in the same Page <HI>Samuel Eaton [Is not the

that is it which leads the Saints to divide and dis|cerne

proclaimed on the house top: and I may say some|thing
more to this Head afterward.</P>
<P>At present I return to my <HI>Antagonists,</HI> who (while
I was Arguing against their immediate Spirit) could
not hold until my quarter of an hour, and this Head

there is no other <HI>Christ</HI> nor <HI>Spirit</HI> within, but the

what is it I say but rendring their Tongues which
should be their Glory and the Glory of God, their

<P>4. I did also mention a fourth Reason against
their Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Spirit wil|ling to be examined by the Scripture and every mans Con|sceence.</NOTE> and had prosecuted it but I knew that
(by reason of my Adversaries interposure) I had
exceeded my quarter of an hour: It was taken

be tried, commanding all men to search the Rec|ords,
commending the <HI>Bereans</HI> for examining <HI>Pauls

this is the true meaning of the Spirit of the Pro|phets

<P>Hence it pleaseth God to give Rules for the trial

<P>On the contrary, I would have shewed (which
indeed all men know) that the thief endured not

which hath been the trade of the false and

<P>How oft have I been visited by the <HI>Quakers,</HI> cry|ing
<HI>Repent, Repent, hearken to the Light within thee,</HI>

(pretending to be Gods two last Prophets and Wit|nesses)
about twenty years since in <HI>London</HI> whose

<P>But to return, while I was beginning to urge the
tryal of the <HI>Spirits, W. Edmundson</HI> said the <HI>Spirit of
God</HI> was above the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and not to be tryed by
them: for it gave out the <HI>Scriptures &amp;c.</HI> And I said
and say it is easie to boast of the <HI>Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers would set the Spi|rit and Scripture at odds.</NOTE> but the <HI>true
Spirit</HI> (in a Sense) and the holy <HI>Scriptures</HI> are one,
as the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son</HI> are one, and therefore can
not but be willing to be examined by the holy
<PB N="137" REF="74">
<HI>Records,</HI> as every man or author will stand to his
own scripture, work or writing; for the Writers
were but <HI>Pens of Heaven writing,</HI> and used by the
hand of the holy <HI>Spirit.</HI> And I remember that I
said to <HI>W. Edmundson,</HI> Friend, You yesterday in
your long Sermon alleadged that <HI>holy Scripture</HI> viz,
<HI>Men will not come to the light, least they should be
reproved,</HI> [88] because their deeds are evil: This is
the true cause of your quarrel against the <HI>Scriptures,</HI>
and of exalting the Spirit above them that is upon
a true ballance, your own Spirit, yea the Spirit of
Sathan to be God, and Christ, and Spirit and all.</P>
<P>After some few interchanges and altercations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 4th Position concerning the Scriptures.</NOTE> we
descended to the fourth <HI>Position,</HI> which they read
out of the Paper (as they did all the rest) which
was this, viz. <HI>That the People called Quakers did not
own the Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In one Copy it was written</HI> Really <HI>own,</HI> viz. They
did not really own <HI>the</HI> Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>I said there was a twofold owning the</HI> Holy Scrip|tures
<HI>or the Writings of God as there is a twofold
owning the</HI> Scriptures <HI>or</HI> Writings of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A twofold owning of any scrip|ture or Writing.</NOTE> <HI>the</HI> Pro|clamations
<HI>and</HI> Declarations of Kings and Princes:
<HI>The one is verbal and literal,</HI> viz. that such a writing
or Declaration, or Treatise is extant, and that it pro|ceeds
from the Kings Authority and Command.</P>
<P>The second is real and actual, when the Authority
of it is in all humble obedience submitted to and
obeyed: when the Justice and Equity, and the ex|cellency
and goodness, as well as the royal Authori|ty
is embraced and magnified.</P>
<P>I said the <HI>Iews</HI> owned verbally and wonderfully
<PB N="138" REF="75">
that Writings of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> and the <HI>Papists</HI>
owned both old and new but it is known that in
many particulars they do in effect deny and damn
them. 1. They both set up their rotten <HI>Traditions,</HI>
their unwritten <HI>Verityes</HI> (as they speak) of equal
authority with, if not (in cases) above the <HI>holy
Scripture.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Iews and Papists and Qua|kers all of them in effect deny the holy Scriptures.</NOTE></P>
<P>2. They set up the Papists by the authority of
the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> a most defective <HI>Translation,</HI>
notoriously false in many places all over above the
first Copyes of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> whence all
<HI>Translations</HI> as <HI>Counterpanes</HI> and secondary Copyes
or <HI>Duplicates</HI> ought to flow.</P>
<P>3. The Papists set up the <HI>Pope</HI> as the only in|fallible
Judg &amp; Interpreter in all <HI>Questions</HI> about the
<HI>Scriptures</HI> and the Jews make their <HI>Rabbies</HI> as so
many <HI>Popes</HI> also.</P>
<P>4. Their <HI>Interpretations</HI> are so forraign and
strange and many of them so absurd &amp; mon|strous
from the genuine &amp; proper Sence of the
Scriptures, and adulterated with <HI>Wresting and alle|gorizings
&amp;c.</HI> that is truly said of them that they
bring not their <HI>Doctrines, Disciplines</HI> and <HI>Conversa|tions</HI>
to the <HI>Scriptures</HI> but force the [89] holy <HI>Scrip|tures</HI>
of God to attend and wait upon their Abomi|nation
as a Negro Slave and Lacquey.</P>
<P>I said the Jews and Papists did not more disowne
the holy <HI>Scriptures</HI> upon the account of their <HI>Popes
and Traditions</HI> and Interpretations than the Quakers
did upon the account of their <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> and
<HI>Interpretations</HI> also.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers slight|ing the holy Scriptures in many horrible Partic|lars.</NOTE> Who knows not that in the

up the <HI>Light within, the Spirit within, the Scriptures

having the spirit that gave it forth? Yea
as the Papists say, if the Scriptures were lost and
burnt out of the world, the <HI>spirit</HI> within them
could give new <HI>Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>Tis true the <HI>Quakers</HI> in this Dispute professed to
be tryed by the <HI>Scriptures,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A dissem|bling Show of Quakers respecting the Scriptures.</NOTE> which the first <HI>Quakers</HI>
among us wholly denied, but only by the Spirit
within them: But what avails this <HI>Confession?</HI> Is it
not but a subtle trick of <HI>Equivocation,</HI> when stil
they profess to owne <HI>G. Fox</HI> all along, and he pro|fesseth
the Soules of all men to be a part of God
and the divine Essence, and that their is no dis|tinction
between <HI>God, Christ, and Spirit</HI> and <HI>them|selves;</HI>
what should hinder but that the Scripture
is but a <HI>dead Letter,</HI> and (compared with their spirit)
a weak and needless <HI>Paper</HI> unto them that hath
such a <HI>light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> within to guide them?</P>
<P>I told them before and now that there was an
<HI>Irish Papist</HI> in the late warrs that spoke the very
heart and soul of <HI>Iews,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Irish Papist con|fessing the Truth.</NOTE> <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Common Pro|testants,</HI>
and the <HI>Quakers</HI> themselves, as to the holy

house he found a Bible and flung it in the Kennel,
and kickt and trod upon it saying, <HI>The plague of God

<P>My Opposite said they owned the <HI>Scriptures</HI> in
<PB N="140" REF="76">
their place as a <HI>Declaration</HI> of the Saints Conditions,
&amp; <HI>Iohn Burnet</HI> took a <HI>Bible</HI> and read publickly that
Passage in <HI>Luke</HI> 1. where <HI>Luke</HI> calls his Writing a
<HI>Declaration.</HI> I urged that this will of God. (for
this <HI>Declaration</HI> of what Christ said and did, and of
all the rest of the Scripture, was a <HI>Declaration and
Revelation</HI> of <HI>Gods</HI> Will to his People and to the
whole World) this written and revealed [90] will
of God I said was the Judge and Decider of all
Questions, the tryer of all <HI>Spirits,</HI> all <HI>Religions,</HI> all
<HI>Churches,</HI> all <HI>Doctrines,</HI> all <HI>Opinions,</HI> all <HI>Actions.</HI>
They answered they did owne the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and
would be tryed by the <HI>Scriptures</HI> (which is a new
trick, meaning according to their own not to be
questioned <HI>Interpretations</HI>) I urged that they set up
their Spirit above the Scriptures, (fathering all their
Revilings Cursings and Abominations upon the
holy Spirit) I asked whether they owned the
Scripture as the square Rule or Guide according to
whose sentence all the Knowledge of God and of
our selves, the Knowledge of Gods Worship and
Service and our own Blessedness and Salvation was
to be determined, yea and the Spirit within them
to be tryed, determined, approved and condemned
also.</P>
<P>They still fled to this <HI>Burrough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scrip|tures miracu|lously pre|servd to be Gods standing outward Record &amp; witness.</NOTE> the Spirit that
gave forth <HI>Scripture</HI> is greater then the <HI>Scripture:</HI>
the spirit is in us, that Spirit only opens the Scrip|ture:
the Spirit is immediate and infallible and
they only who have this Spirit know the Scrip|tures.
I answered that I maintained the inward
breathing of the holy <HI>Spirit</HI> more than themselves,
<PB N="141" REF="76">
for I quoted before <HI>Luke 11. viz.</HI> that we ought in
all our <HI>Preachings, Hearings, Readings, Prayings,
&amp;c.</HI> to beg the help of the <HI>Spirit</HI> called the Finger
and Power of God: and yet I also maintained that
this Record, this Word Will or Mind of God writ|ten

hand of his holy Spirit, and so miraculously pre|served
from the Rage of the Devils fiery Instru|ments,
<HI>Babilonian, Assyrian, Romane</HI> and <HI>Popish Ty|rants</HI>
and that much among the Jewes and Papists
(and much by their meanes also though they hate it)
I say this Record is the outward and external <HI>Light,
Lanthorn, Iudge, Guide, Rule</HI> by which God wit|nesseth
himself and his Truth in the World, com|forteth
and feedeth his saints in their Dispersions,
discovers and reforms the defects and wanderings of
his People (as in <HI>Iosiah</HI> his finding this Record,
and <HI>Ezekiel &amp; Iohn</HI> eating the Book, out of which
the holy Spirit inspired them to prophesie to Kings
and Peoples <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Tis true who doubts it but that God and the
Spirit were before the Scriptures, and so he was be|fore
the Creation, before Christ Jesus was born, and
his Redemption actually accomplished: are the
works of God therefore, and the several Dispensa|tions
and Institutions and Instruments of God in
their several times and [91] places of any whit less
power or esteem because the most holy <HI>God</HI> and his
most holy Spirit were before them? <HI>Iohn the Bap|tist</HI>
saith that Christ Jesus was preferred before him,
for he was before him and he was not worthy to
unloose the Shoe-latchet of Jesus the <HI>Lamb</HI> of
<PB N="142" REF="77">
God; and yet for the fulfilling of all Righteousness
the <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> must come to <HI>Iohn</HI> to be baptized
of him, and the holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Light</HI> will declare
himself to be true by the holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and dis|cover
all other Spirits to be spurious false and Bas|tards
and notwithstanding their cracking and prat|ing
of Light if they slight this outward standing
<HI>Record</HI> and Witness of God in the World it is be|cause
there is no light in them,</P>
<P>One of these two must be done either we must
subscribe to the <HI>Papists</HI> and by their pretended

<P>While we were thus discoursing <HI>W. Edmundson</HI>
propounded this Similitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holp Scriptures are Gods Love-let|ters</NOTE> if I should write a letter
to a friend and subscribe my name <HI>W. Edmundson,</HI>
doth it follow therefore that the Letter is <HI>W. Ed|mundsons?</HI>
I answer that the Quakers do affirm
that the Scripture is within them, what is the eng|lish
of that? but that the Light which they and
every man in the World hath within them (the
Christ the Spirit which every one hath) is Scrip|ture,
and in a sence I said it was a Truth that <HI>W. E.</HI>
his letter to his friend was <HI>W. Edm.</HI> not only a
<HI>Declaration</HI> of his word, mind or will to his Friend,
<PB N="143" REF="77">
but in a respect his mind and will it self that he
sent in Writing to his Friend, and so the Scripture
in a Sence is Gods mind and Will to us.</P>
<P>Upon this occasion I told them that the Scrip|tures
were the <HI>Love Letters of Christ Iesus</HI> to his
<HI>Church,</HI> as the <HI>Love-Letters</HI> of some mighty <HI>Mon|arch</HI>
to his Betrothed Queen or Empress, they are
dear, not as common <HI>Paper</HI> and <HI>Ink,</HI> but as the
<HI>Good-Will,</HI> the dearest Love and heart of the King
and Emperour himself: and thus are holy <HI>Scrip|tures</HI>
highly <HI>prized</HI> and embraced, and laid up in
the heart and bosome of the true <HI>Children of God,</HI>
92] believed listned to, and followed as the voice of
<HI>Christ Iesus</HI> to his true sheep and Spouse: the
<HI>Bastard Children</HI> and the <HI>Wolves</HI> covered only with

speaketh.</P>
<P>Tis true as <HI>G. Fox</HI> all along in his Book vapours
that the Spirit was before Scripture, and gave forth
Scripture: but I proved before, that their Spirit,
their Light, their Christ, were but hellish <HI>Dark|ness,</HI>
the spirit of Sathan, and a false lying Christ,

divers (as before the Law and after (but in this last

freely confessed that the holy Scripture was his
first help, the second Meditation, the third earnest

not only ordained his Messenger or Preachers of
his glad Tydings to <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh 20. 2. considered</NOTE> but his Pen|men
also, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 20. for those two great ends (as to

<P>1. These things are written that you may believe

<P>And 2. That Believing in him (that individual
person called Jesus, and not in a Fancy within) we
might have Life and Blessedness.</P>
<P>It is no wonder therefore, that the <HI>Devil</HI> (the

some of their <HI>Mahumetan Priests</HI> dared to say (for

<P>Whether this Book be the Book of the <HI>Revela|tion</HI>

it is apparent that during the 42 Months of the

<P>It hath been observed that there never were any
(more than others) famous for Christanity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Iews outward reverence to the Script.</NOTE> but
they first were famous for an admirable Love kin|dled
by God in their Hearts to the <HI>Holy Scriptures:</HI>
It is true the <HI>Iews</HI> (to whom the Oracles of God
were committed, <HI>to wit</HI> in the <HI>Old Testament:</HI> how
studious have they been in it, even to every Word,
and Letter? they accounted it a crime for any Book
to ly upon it, but this alwayes to lye uppermost.
My self have seen the <HI>Old Testament</HI> of the <HI>Iews</HI>
most curious writing whose price (in way of trade)
was threescore pound, which my Brother a <HI>Turkey-Merchant</HI>
had and shewed me: But I speak of an
inward love, a <HI>Soul-love,</HI> &amp;c. It is wonderful what
<HI>Luther</HI> relates of that blessed <HI>Duke of Saxony,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Protestants aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ction to the Scripture</NOTE> whom [94] God stir'd up to favour and cherish
<HI>Luther,</HI> &amp;c <HI>viz.</HI> that he caused his six Pages each of
them to read to him daily everyone his hour in the
Holy Scripture. This was the affection in all the
first Witnesses the <HI>Waldensians, the Bohemians, the
English, French, Dutch, Scotch,</HI> &amp;c. who together
with the Scriptures had mighty Affection to the
study of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> in which golden
<HI>Cups</HI> and <HI>Bowles</HI> the <HI>King of Kings</HI> was pleased to
convey the Wine (like <HI>Ahashuerosh</HI>) of his Eternal
Majesty and Goodness to us.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to consider how much the study
of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and of the <HI>Hebrew and Greek
<PB N="147" REF="79">
Tongues</HI> confounded and put to flight the <HI>Papists,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scrip|tures put both Pa|pists &amp; Quakers to flight</NOTE>
and forced them to study the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and the
<HI>Tongues</HI> also, both which the barbarous dark Spirit
of the <HI>Quakers</HI> hate, as darkness hates the Light.</P>
<P>It is no wonder this Spirit of Lying cries out so
fiercely against the Schools of Learning in <HI>Old and
New England,</HI> it knows that the right and regular
propagation of natural, of civil, and especially of
<HI>Divine Knowledge</HI> scatters the thick Fogs of the
<HI>Quakers</HI> affected hellish ignorance.</P>
<P>The blessed <HI>Martyrs</HI> and <HI>Witnesses</HI> of Jesus in all
ages have been ravished with holy delights like <HI>Da|vid</HI>
in the holy Scripture, in <HI>Q Maries</HI> dayes, that

most of the holy Epistles in <HI>Greek</HI> by heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christs Martyrs or Witnesses love to Scriptures</NOTE> even

the fire of persecution grew hotter, so did those

and <HI>Paul at Troas</HI>) spend hours and nights in Prayer
and holy Conference upon the Scriptures, and those
things which the Lord Jesus should and hath now
accomplished according to the Scriptures.</P>
<P>It is true (in print) <HI>Iames Parnel</HI> spake like a
<HI>Papist</HI> an <HI>Atheist,</HI> and a <HI>Quaker</HI> of the holy Mar|tyrs

of Martyrs it self.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames Parnel his horrible sin &amp; Iudg|ment</NOTE> It is no wonder that the most
Righteous and jealous Lord left him not to dye the

himself to be Christ by fasting 40 dayes and

<P>I freely acknowledge that many of these Partic|ulars
I could not then express because of my Con|finement

<P>I remember I urged that dead and rotten esteem

<P>The <HI>Quotations</HI> out of <HI>G. Fox</HI> which then I could
not insist on, I shall present a few and then pass on
to the <HI>fifth Position.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the</HI> 47th. <HI>Pag.</HI> G. Fox <HI>brings in</HI> Ios. Miller <HI>say|ing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Josh. Miller.</NOTE> It is an Errour (if not damnable) to say Christ is
the meanes, and that there is no other meanes of Sal|vation.</P>
<P><HI>He Answers,</HI> And Christ saith no man comes unto
the Father but by me: and he is able to the uttermost to
save? and he shall be my Salvation to the end of the
Earth saith the Lord: and saith the Apostle, God is in
Christ reconciling the World to himself, and he that
hath the Son hath Life, and the Father and the Son
are one, and there is no salvation in any other.</P>
<P>I reply: I shall now freely declare to the Sence
of this <HI>Allegation,</HI> though in the Dispute my <HI>Ad|versaryes</HI>
would not suffer me to meddle with the
Sence of <HI>G. Fox</HI> his words, contrary to our Coven|ant
in my Writing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers notor|ious Cove|nant-Breakers.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> that each Party should
speak as long as they pleased, which Liberty they
enjoyed without my <HI>Interruption:</HI> and first I doe
not think that <HI>Ios. Millers</HI> words run so loosely in
his own Book: I do not think that a man of Wis|dom
would call it an error to say that <HI>Christ is the
<PB N="151" REF="81">
meanes of Salvation:</HI> But to the second part, to
which <HI>G. Fox</HI> opposeth, I believe it is an <HI>Error,</HI> and
a damnable <HI>Error,</HI> and a Doctrine of <HI>Devils,</HI> to say
there is no other meanes of Salvation: for this
wretched <HI>Iugler</HI> subtilly confounds the <HI>Instrumental
Causes</HI> of <HI>Salvation</HI> with [97] the <HI>Efficient</HI> in God the
Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Means of Salvation.</NOTE> and <HI>Meritorious</HI> in God the Son, Christ Je|sus.
'Tis true, there is no <HI>Redemption</HI> and Forgive|ness
of sin, but in his Blood, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1. though I
know this <HI>Iugler</HI> (as before) means not a Christ,
nor his Blood, nor Death as we do mean, but
<HI>Imaginary within,</HI> &amp;c. And yet as <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>In|struments:</HI>
Christs Messengers are said to save them|selves
and others: The holy Scriptures are said to
<HI>make wise to Salvation:</HI> A man may be <HI>Gods means</HI>
or <HI>Hand</HI> to save his <HI>Wife</HI> and the <HI>Wife</HI> her <HI>Hus|band:
We are saved by hope</HI> saith <HI>Paul,</HI> and saved by
<HI>Baptisme</HI> saith <HI>Peter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Union between the Meri|torious Cause and means, and the In|strumental and Effici|ent or worker.</NOTE> yea, Women are saved by
Child-bearing, as God blesseth those <HI>painful Curses</HI>
to be blessed means of bringing to, or growing up
in Christ the Saviour. All these subtly and wicked|ly
<HI>G. Fox</HI> sets at variance with the <HI>Meritorious Sal|vation</HI>
by Christ Jesus, between which there is an
<HI>Heavenly Union</HI> and <HI>Concord,</HI> as between a man sav|ing
his Brother by throwing a <HI>Rope,</HI> or <HI>Oar,</HI> or
<HI>Board</HI> unto him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or a <HI>Midwife</HI> saving both Wo|man
and her Birth in <HI>Child-bearing</HI> by the Means
of Women, and Helps which her Skil and Labour
administreth to her. To talk of this <HI>Immediate
Christ</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> without Scriptures, without Preach|ing,
and other holy means, is as silly, as Impious,
<PB N="152" REF="82">
as Blockish, as Blasphemous, and as Bedlam, and
Frantick, as wicked and <HI>Anti-Christian.</HI></P>
<P>Would not every body laugh at <HI>G. Fox,</HI> if he
should say, that because the <HI>Kings Majesty</HI> graciously
pardons <HI>Condemned Rebels</HI> at the <HI>Mediation</HI> of the
<HI>Prince</HI> his Son, therefore the Composing the writing,
the proclaiming of the pardon, the bring- of it to
the <HI>Rebels hands</HI> written and sealed with the <HI>Kings
broad Seal,</HI> are no means of their Salvation and
Deliverance?</P>
<P><HI>In</HI> Pap. 221. <HI>he brings in the Author of</HI> Ho|sannah
to the Son of <HI>David,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hosanna to the Son of David.</NOTE> <HI>saying,</HI> [The sure Word

<P>He Answers, Doth the Scripture shine in a dark
place until the Day dawne? Are they them them
that must be taken heed unto as to a Light? Can
any see the Scripture, and know the Scripture, but
with the <HI>Light within?</HI> Can not a <HI>Cain,</HI> a <HI>Baalam,</HI>
a <HI>Core</HI> bring Scripture that is gone from the Spirit
of Prophesie within, and then put the Letter for it?</P>
<P>98] I Reply 1. I know that <HI>Fox</HI> makes their <HI>Idol
within</HI> called <HI>Light,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The more sure Word of Pro|phesie.</NOTE> to be the more sure word of
Prophesie, and his usual proof is, <HI>[The Testimony of
Iesus is the Spirit of Prophesie,]</HI> But first, why must
all the Prophets or Messengers of God, who from
the beginning of the world were Gods mouth and
Pens, Concerning the <HI>Birth, Life, Death, Burial,
Resurrection, Ascention</HI> and coming to Judgement
of the Lord Jesus be here cast out from the Word
of Prophesie? Is it nothing, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1, that God
spake (surely Gods speaking is his word) <HI>God spake
<PB N="153" REF="82">
by the mouth of his holy Prophets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods speaking by his Prophets is his Word.</NOTE> <HI>which have been
since the World began.</HI> And <HI>Heb. 1. God spake sun|dry
times and in divers manners in Time past unto the
Fathers,</HI> but how did God thus speake or utter his
word, but by the Prophets: And <HI>Rom.</HI> 16. But
now is made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the
Prophets, according to the Commandment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Therefore how oft is it written concerning the
Lord Jesus. <HI>These things were done that the Scriptures
might be Fulfilled,]</HI> in which regard, (as to our satis|faction
and belief) the written word of Prophesie
of the Prophets are a more sure Word and Evi|dence
to us concerning the Lord Jesus then the
<HI>Miraculous Appearance</HI> from Heaven of <HI>Moses</HI> and
<HI>Elias,</HI> and the voice from Heaven of which <HI>Peter</HI>
here speaketh; though in it self a true Testimony,
yet not so sure, so firm and pregnant as the Word
that God spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets
from the beginning of the World, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence the
Answer of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and indeed of Christ Jesus:
If they, hear not <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets, neither
will they believe though one should rise from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>2. How sure is the <HI>Quakers Light,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mad|ness of leaving the Scrip|tures and turning to a Spirit within.</NOTE> their Word of
<HI>Prophesie?</HI> A sober mind can not but admire that
Face and Forehead of Brass and Adamant with
which God the Righteous Judge of the whole
hath plauged Satan and his Followers, so that they
blush not to prefer such a simple Image, a <HI>meer Ba|bie</HI>
and <HI>Childs Puppet</HI> of their <HI>Immediate Word</HI> of
<HI>Prophesie</HI> before the Word, the mind and will of
God by the mouth of all the Prophets?</P>
<P>For is it not known in the holy Scripture, in all
<PB N="154" REF="83">
Histories, in all Ages, in all Nations, what Cursed
Opinions, horrible Uncleannesses, Bloody Murthers

<P>3. This Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The workings of Satan by Spirits and Inspi|rations in all Ages.</NOTE> <HI>Revel. 19. The Testimony of

of Jesus was the work of Gods Spirit in the <HI>Angels,</HI>
in their way, as well as in <HI>Iohns</HI> and <HI>Peters</HI> in theirs,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and shall we say that the Angels too are
<HI>Quakers,</HI> and Christ hath enlightened them also, as

Doth not Christ threaten the <HI>Adders</HI> to, and <HI>Dimin|ishers</HI>

<P>2. Why should G. <HI>Fox</HI> here mention <HI>Cain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Devil and the Quakers alleadging Scriptures</NOTE> <HI>Balaam,
Core?</HI> what Scriptures could they bring? what Scrip|tures
were written in their times? I think it no
breach of Charity to guess that the <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>G.
Fox</HI> are so used to Cursing and Censuring their <HI>Op|posites</HI>
(at the first dash for <HI>Cains, Baalams, Cores,</HI>
that they could not well tell how to miss them:
<PB N="155" REF="83">
Such persons no question, and the <HI>Foxians,</HI> and the

But doth the Divel cordially prize and love
the word of <HI>Prophesie,</HI> the <HI>Testimony</HI> and <HI>Witnesses</HI>

the holy Scripture is so powerful that the very
Counterfeit, the picture and Name of it will do
him good Service, with such whom he desires to
cheat and Ruine. And yet <HI>secondly</HI> this shews the <HI>Qua|kers
horrible wickedness,</HI> that although they love the
holy Scripture (for the general of them) as well as
doth their <HI>lying Father,</HI> yet turn they the Truth of

which he turns into poyson, even from the same
Flowers of Paradice, the holy Scriptures, from
whence the <HI>hony Bees,</HI> the true Believers, suck the
pure hony of Eternal Truth and Comfort.</P>
<P>3. Again, what madness is it for this <HI>blind
Dreamer</HI> to ask his Opposite, whether the Scrip|ture
shines in a dark place until the [100] dawne?
&amp; whether they must be taken heed unto as to a
Light? For, how often is the holy Scripture even the

Law, the Word, and other Prophesies of Scripture,
or written Prophesies, Words and Oracles of God!
For all their Childish Vapourings and pratings of
their Light, the <HI>Eternal Father of Lights</HI> proclaims
them to be Children of <HI>howling darkness</HI> and that
<PB N="156" REF="84">
there is no Light within them: I speak it with
horrour and Amazement, and also with sorrowful
Confidence that he that shall find a spark of true
Light either of the knowledge or grace of the
true Lord Jesus in this their <HI>Fantastick Light,</HI> he
shall find the Living among the Dead, he shall
prove the Prophets that spake, and the Lord God of
the Prophets whose word was spoke, to be Lyars,
for saying there is no Light within them.</P>
<P>But <HI>Fox</HI> again demands, <HI>(Can any know the Scrip|ture

what Light have the <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Iews,</HI> and the

<HI>Fox</HI> his&punc; Opposites saying, <HI>viz.</HI> the only weapon

Scripture? what is this to the point of the Com|pass?
may not half and Eye see what a <HI>simple

near the Ships Course and point in hand.</P>
<P>2. Who sees not <HI>Fox</HI> in his <HI>Burrough</HI> of the di|vers
Acceptation of the Word Christ? For in the
Sense of his Opposite that man Christ Jesus who
fought the Devil, and <HI>Fox</HI> Confesseth died at <HI>Ieru|salem:</HI>
was not before the Scriptures, But his Birth,

what is this Confession that the <HI>Scripture is profitable

for Correction,</HI> &amp;c. but a kind of grant to his Op|posite
that Christ did overcome the Devil by this

But receiving the Word from God, is, as they that
gave forth the Scriptures: which man lives by and
not by bread alone, and so knows him who was
before Scripture was given forth: And for saying
that the Scripture was the Ground of Christs Faith,
he was afore the Scripture was writ, and so fulfils
their Words, and is the Author and the Finisher of
the Saints Faith, which was before the Scripture
was given forth, him by whom the World was
made, and is the Author of the Saints Faith,

[And the Magistrate is not to Level the Law with

<P>G. <HI>Fox</HI> Answers, the Magistrate of Christ, the
help, Government for him, he is in the Light and
power of Christ: and he is to subject all under the
power of Christ, into his Light, else he [108] is not
a faithful Magistrate: and his Laws are agreeable
and Answer according to that of God in every
man: when men act contrary to it they do evil, so
he is a Terrour to the Evil doers, discern the pre|cious
and the just from the vile, and this is a praise
to them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hat do well.</P>
<P>I urged from hence, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> (and G, <HI>Fox</HI>
in his Book in many places) owne no Magistrates
but such as are godly that is in their dark Sence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers Zeal|ous Perse|cutors.</NOTE>
that be Magistrates for their Christ, be in the Light
and Power of Christ, for then say they, their Laws
are agreeable to that of God in every man.</P>
<P>2. These their Magistrates (in the Light) ought
to subject even the Consciences and Souls of
all that be under them, by <HI>Corporal punishments</HI> to
come under the Power of Christ into the Light.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="90">
3. This is Confirmed and sealed with a <HI>peremp|tory
Doom</HI> upon the neglecter and failer, <HI>viz. [Else

<P>4. I observe the Reason and Equity which they
alleadge of this subjecting all Subjects to the Light
of Christ, because such <HI>Magistrates, Laws</HI> and <HI>Edicts</HI>
are witnessed by God in every man, and therefore
he sins against God himself who breaks such a <HI>Mag|istrates

<P>Upon my urging of some of these particulars
some of them desired to hear the <HI>Quotation</HI> read
again:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet will not own it.</NOTE> so <HI>Iohn Burnet</HI> read the whole passage again,
and said, that G. <HI>Foz</HI> spake not there of matters of
Religion and Conscience, nor of the Magistrates
compelling men to be of his Religion and Consci|ence,
but of punishing them for matters of wrong
between man and man, which are against the Light
in every mans Conscience, as <HI>Drunkenness, Whoredome,
Murther, Stealing,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>I Replyed, the Terms were such both of the
Question by the <HI>Opposite,</HI> and the Answer by G.
<HI>Fox</HI> which argue and Comprehend the matters of
Religion and Conscience, <HI>viz.</HI> If the Magistrate be

and G. <HI>Fox</HI> his Terms are the same about Christ
and the Light and bringing them subject to Christ.</P>
<P>2. It is not Imaginable, that the Opposer would
question whether the <HI>Civil Officer</HI> ought not to
punish such incivilities and [109] Incivilities and
Inhumanities as <HI>Drunkenness, Whoredome, Stealing,

to the</HI> sixth Position <HI>which was,</HI> viz. [The

of Repentance, Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Assertion</HI> hath two main Branches: <HI>First,</HI>
that the Quakers Religion is an <HI>Heresie,</HI> and them|selves

<P>2. Not only so, (about the Circumstances of
which Gods own dear Servants themselves greatly
differ) but also (which is more Lamentable and dan|gerous)
in the Doctrines of Repentance and Faith,
and the rest of the graces of Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>I told them <HI>first,</HI> that the word <HI>Hairesis</HI> Heresie,
in <HI>Greek,</HI> (from whence the word <HI>Hairetikos</HI> an
Heretick) signified an <HI>Opinion</HI> or <HI>Opinions,</HI> chosen

and a ugmented from the Greatness and <HI>Vitallity</HI> of
the matter of the Opinions, but the <HI>Formality</HI> and
<HI>Nature</HI> of it lay in the will and obstinacy thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> stood up and said, that <HI>Heresie</HI> was de|fined

Error in the <HI>Foundation</HI> obstinately stood in: But
I said we had not time to enter upon a Dispute
about the word or thing at this time, the Substance
of my <HI>Affirmation</HI> was, that their Religion, Sect or
way was false, and gone from the <HI>Institution</HI> and
<HI>way</HI> of the Lord Jesus delivered by himself and his
Apostles, or <HI>Messengers:</HI></P>
<P>1. As to worship, they denyed the Converting

the <HI>Ministers Invisible,</HI> the <HI>Baptisme</HI> and <HI>Sup|per

<P>The second (which was aur <HI>Position</HI>) was in those
<HI>two great Fundamentals,</HI> the <HI>Beginning,</HI> or <HI>A. B. C.</HI>
of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers Here|ticks against all the Christ|ian Princi|ples, and more Her|etical against the first Christian Religion then any Protestauts or Papists.</NOTE> viz Repentance from dead
works and Faith towards God: As for those two

they concerned the Church, and worship, (concern|ing

matter of worship, these wandring Souls are <HI>Here|ticks,</HI>
that is, obstinately maintaining <HI>Notoriously

that the many Sects amongst the <HI>Protestants,</HI> yea,
and the <HI>Papists</HI> themselves do not so differ from <HI>a
true Protestant</HI> and <HI>true Christian</HI> as do these <HI>wilful,
ignorant,</HI> and <HI>wandring Souls.</HI></P>
<P>1. Then as to Repentance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers Here|sy in mat|ter of Re|peutance.</NOTE> I said it was the first
heavenly and saving work of God upon the Soul,
<PB N="178" REF="95">
wherein he turned back home again the whole
Soul unto himself, being revolted and run from
him into the Arms of Rebellion in the Fall of our
<HI>first Parents.</HI></P>
<P>This was the great point preached by <HI>Moses</HI> and
the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and more expressly by <HI>Iohn the Bap|tist,</HI>
and by the Lord Jesus himself: and when he
sent abroad his Apostles or Messengers into all Na|tions,
they were to preach the Gospel or glad News
of the Forgiveness of sins according to <HI>Luke</HI> 24.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This 24th. of Luke I earnekly Insisted on.</NOTE>
viz. that Repentance and Remission of sins should
be preached in his Name unto all Nations, begin|ning
at <HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Here about I remember they told me that it was
known that they preached the Doctrine of Repent|ance
and of turning from all sin unto God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I Answered, that the <HI>Papists</HI> and they made a
shew and Colour of Repentance, but it had not the
Life and Substance of Repentance in it: It was no
more but an <HI>empty Title</HI> and <HI>shadow</HI> of Repentance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa|pists and Quakers Repent|ance.</NOTE>
we know the <HI>Papists</HI> define their Repentance by
these three. <HI>First,</HI> Contrition, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Confession,
and <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Satisfaction or Restitution.</P>
<P>But I said the <HI>Protestants</HI> protested against this
Repentance of the <HI>Papists,</HI> and so against the <HI>Qua|kers,</HI>
for, who knew not the sorrow and Confessions
of <HI>Saul,</HI> and <HI>Ahab,</HI> and <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> and the <HI>Philistins,</HI>
and <HI>Iudas,</HI> yea, and also the Restitution which <HI>Iudas</HI>
made, (not daring to keep in his hands that which
he had unjustly and wickedly gotten) and yet who
can truly ascribe unto these mens Repentance, the
Character and blessedness of a true Christian return|ing
and coming home to God.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="95">
2. I said it is known in daily practice, that when
some times [116] <HI>Notorious</HI> and <HI>openly Flagitious
Persons</HI> profess to be <HI>Quakers,</HI> (for all their craking
of fear and trembling and Quaking) there hath
appeared no Sense of godly sorrow, of godly Con|trition
and brokenness of heart in them, for their
sinful Nature and Life against so <HI>Infinitely pure</HI> an
<HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Majesty?</HI> but immediately (upon their
bowing down to Satan, and owning him as a <HI>Light,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers Converts.</NOTE>
and <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> within them) they are, hav|ing
less Prophaneness now pure and holy as God is,
they can no more sin then Christ can! <HI>the Mistery
of godliness is God manifested in their Flesh,</HI> I know
some of them say they come to perfection by de|grees,
yet they say the least of their <HI>new-born Qua|kers</HI>
can not sin, and what is that but Perfection?
yea, they are Christ and God: and therefore why
should they give respect to any <HI>King,</HI> or <HI>Kings,</HI> &amp;c.
why should they not <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> the <HI>Aged,

be perfect Christians?</P>
<P>3. The <HI>Protestants</HI> both <HI>English, French</HI> and
<HI>Dutch,</HI> &amp;c. have manifested against the <HI>Papists,</HI> and
therein against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that Repentance is a

God as God:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|testants true Re|pentance.</NOTE> from the sin of Nature, and that

Christ, nor the Flesh of Christ into their own
Flesh: The <HI>Quakers</HI> can give no Account what is
become of the Flesh or Body of that man Christ
Jesus, these <HI>Foxes</HI> have devoured the Lambs of God.
Miraculous and Monstrous is [119] the Papists <HI>blas|phemous</HI>
and <HI>Bloody Fancy</HI> of <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> but
not more miraculous and monstrous, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then that
of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> which granteth Christ Jesus to have
been born, lived and dyed as We, &amp;c and yet now
Transubstantiated into a Spirit, and the <HI>Quakers
Flesh.</HI> So that in the Upshot, the Christ in whom
they believe is vanished (by an <HI>Hellish Chimistry</HI>)
into themselves, and it is most certain, (the Lord
open in great mercy some of their Eyes to see it)
they do believe on themselves, and that lying Spirit
within them.</P>
<P>I remember, that hereabouts <HI>Iohn Burnet</HI> said, that
it was not true that they preached not true Repent|ance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John Bur|net his Sermon</NOTE>
and herein he fell into a Speech or Sermon to
the People, professing that the <HI>Quakers</HI> maintained
Repentance toward God and Faith in Christ and
<PB N="184" REF="98">
Godliness, and Righteousness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he continued
I Judge above half an hour, (though not so long
nor so furious as <HI>William Edmundson</HI> the day before.</P>
<P>I listned carefully and watcht his Ending (being
desirous to say something least another of them
should fall into a Sermon also and put me by) and
I speedily said (to this Effect) Friend you have here
delivered many holy Truths of God (at this there
was deep silence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And my Answer</NOTE> as if I had turn'd a Proselite&punc; at
least it pleased them to be applauded, I went on and
said concerning Repentance and turning from all
sin, of the Blood of Christ, and of being saved by
his Blood, <HI>of living soberly, Righteously, and godly in
this present World,</HI> &amp;c. but withal I said, they did
not reach me nor any thing that I had spoken as

between true Repentance and false, and
shewing the difference between the true Faith and
the false: So that I said you might have preacht

<P>What Scripture is more common in the mouths

<P>To which I say, how many painted Anchors and

<P>Hope is one, as in time I may furthet demon|strate.</P>
<P>For, do they not overthrow the very Nature of

are not raised up (they say) <HI>Spiritual Bodies,</HI> being
(though of late) more subtly and hipocritically all

<P>It is reported that some of them at their Death

some have Charitably thought that they intend

th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ir <HI>Apostacie</HI> and <HI>Heresie</HI> in the matters of <HI>Repent|ance,
Faith,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>In</HI> Pag. 127. <HI>he brings in</HI> Iohn Bunyan <HI>saying,</HI>
[It is a Counterfietlng of the New Birth for men to
follow the Light wherewith men coming into the World
are enlightned.]</P>
<P><HI>G.</HI> Fox <HI>Answereth,</HI> [which none comes to the New
Birth, but who comes to the Light, wherewith every man,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which believing in is a Child of the Light: believ|ing
and receiving comes to receive power to be the Sons
of God.]</P>
<P>I Reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new Birth of the Qua|kers</NOTE> none are truly Converted, born again,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in a true Sense they come to Christ Jesus:
For the Scripture saith, <HI>he gives Repentance to Israel,
He is the Author and Finisher of our Faith:</HI> But that
Jesus Christ as God, (so the <HI>Quakers</HI> owne him) and
<PB N="189" REF="100">
as man (for so they also owne him) should be in
every man, and Woman, and Child in the World,
I have proved and shall prove it to be a <HI>blockish</HI> and
<HI>Devilish Fancy.</HI></P>
<P>2. If this Light, this Christ the Mediator be|tween
God and man be only a Spirit and not man,
why do the Scriptnre, why do the <HI>Quakere</HI> madly
say there was such a man, though they cannot tell
now what is become of him except he be (as they
say) within, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>3. If this Light, this Christ, this Mediator be
in every man, what should be the Reason that so
many <HI>Thousands</HI> and <HI>Ten Thousand</HI> of <HI>Millions</HI> see
him not? Only a few persons Cursing and Reviling
all the rest, and that say all but the <HI>Quakers</HI> are de|ceived?
Can the Sun be in a Chamber and persons
not blind, but [123] seeing and awake, and using his
Light and yet not see it. Certainly it is but a <HI>painted
Sun</HI> that doth not shine equally on all, it is but a
<HI>painted Fire</HI> that doth not burn, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> are
but <HI>Pictures</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> and pictures of men to
argue aftet such a Rate, that Christ not only as
God, and Creatour should be in every man, but also
as the Mediator, as the Spirit, and yet not operate
according to the Nature of the Sun and Fire: It is
true, the Lord Jesus came into the dark world, and
their darkness comprehended him not to be He
that was to come, the <HI>true Messiah:</HI> but when Christ
Jesus as Mediator, the true or only Light shall
dwell in the Understanding and Will, and Memory,
and Affections of a man or Woman, and those per|sons
be savingly inlightened by him as you write,
<PB N="190" REF="101">
and yet not Converted and saved by him, it can be
the Language of none but those that peep and mut|ter
<HI>Isai.</HI> 8. but have no true Light, but a false and
painted Light within them.</P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true and false new Birth.</NOTE> saith <HI>Fox</HI> this turning to the Light within
is the New Birth: But the <HI>Holy Record</HI> saith, that
till the preaching of the Word, or Gospel, or glad
News come to the mind of a man, (ordinarily by
the Ear, and hearing, and preaching, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.)
there is no <HI>Faith,</HI> nor <HI>Covenant,</HI> nor <HI>Christ,</HI> nor God
in the Soul, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. and we are not only in dark|ness,
but darkness it self, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5. and only by the
holy Word and Spirit preached<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Interline "is" after preached. <HI>R. W. Ms. Ann.</HI></NOTE> the blessing, <HI>Isai.</HI>
59., God shineth in our hearts, and not by any such
<HI>Immediate Fantastick Faith</HI> or Spirit, as the <HI>Anti
Christian Quakers</HI> dream of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers put out the Eyes of their own Experi|ence.</NOTE> yea, against the Light
of a twofold Experience in their own Souls.</P>
<P>1. That many of them being enlightened and
formerly Convicted by the reading or preaching of
the Doctrine, Word or Will of God revealed in
the holy Scripture.</P>
<P>2. That of their new Light (as they falsly and
foolishly prate) pretended to be brought unto their
Ears and knowledge by the means of these <HI>new
Apostles, Preachers,</HI> and <HI>Ministers,</HI> so pretended of
Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>When God hides (that is by <HI>Spiritual Iudgements</HI>)
the Light of Scripture, of the Spirit of Reason,
and of Experience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who can find it out? No
man, no nor Devil can subsist one minute with|out
the power of <HI>Christs Eternal Power and God-head:</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="101">
[124] but when Christ Jesus comes into the
Soul as <HI>Mediator</HI> of the <HI>new Covenant,</HI> and be thus
idle and not operative in all mankinde in the

which must be either because he cannot, or because
he will not, as the <HI>Leaper</HI> said, is as black and blas|phemous
a Fancy as any <HI>Atheistical</HI> or <HI>AntiChristian

But that Christ Literally shed his Blood within

are not withont also, (which is the mark all these

<P>Pag. 10. <HI>He brings in</HI> Iohn Bunyar <HI>saying, [It</HI> is
not Faith and works that justifies a man before God,
but it is Faith and good works which justifie in the

the sight of God: and he saith, that works is only to
justifie their Faith to be true before men.]</P>
<P>G. <HI>Fox</HI> Answers, <HI>Abraham</HI> was not Justified only
to men by his Obedience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers Popish Jus|tification by works.</NOTE> but to God: And where
there is <HI>Faith</HI> there is <HI>Iustification</HI> which works by

only to Justifie them in the sight of men. For the
work of God is to do what he saith, &amp; the will
which who doth not is not Justified by so doing,
but to be beaten with stripes: who seek to be Jus|tified
by their Faith and works in the sight of men
are dead, Faith and works both.</P>
<P>I Reply, He that reads this passage may without
doubting Conclude that G. <HI>Fox</HI> and his <HI>Foxians</HI> are
as <HI>perfect Pharisees (Iewish</HI> and <HI>Popish</HI>) as ever bur|roughed
in <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Ierusalem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa|pists and Quakers see no need of Christ.</NOTE> maintaining a Cove|nant

<P>2. Whereas G. <HI>Fox</HI> asketh what is the work of
God, but to do what he saith.</P>
<P>I Reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa|pists and Quakers know not the differ|ence be|tween the two Cove|nants</NOTE> 1. The work of God (according to
Christs Doctrine) is to believe on him whom God
sent. It is true, it is the Command of God to
keep his Commands, but since the deadly Fall of
man, none, not one being able, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. (though <HI>Fox</HI>
deny it,) it is the work, the <HI>great work</HI> of God to fly
<PB N="195" REF="103">
to that <HI>blessed Propitiation</HI> for poor sinners, (through|out

and that of <HI>mercy,</HI> and of receiving all as a <HI>Beggar,</HI>
and Condemned Rebels, <HI>poor proud Souls</HI> they know
not any difference between the Blood of Christ
Iesus and their own Blood, as we shall see afterward.</P>
<P>3. Whereas he saith, that they do not Gods will
are not justified in so doing:</P>
<P>I Answer, therefore it follows ronndly as his Con|clusion,
that they that do Gods will are justified in
so doing: that is their sins are pardoned as <HI>David</HI>
and <HI>Paul</HI> by pardon of Sin describe justification,</P>
<P>127] Who sees not the subtlety of this <HI>Fox</HI> cheat|ing
himself and others with the divers signification
of this <HI>Latin word Iustification?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fox his playing with the word Justi|fication</NOTE> It is true, a man
can not be justified or defended for <HI>Thieving, Whor|ing,

abstaining from Sin, and by this their work they
obtein the pardon, and stand by this their work,
legally right and justified in the <HI>Court of Heaven!</HI></P>
<P>I Conclude, that by these hints a broken hearted
sinner, who hath seen Sin as Sin, the sin of his Na|ture,
his chief sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will see how far from the
Doctrine of true Repentance, true Faith, &amp;c these

need they have to Examine themselves whether
they be in the Faith, and whether there be any other

the <HI>Protestants, David</HI> and his <HI>Followers</HI> Confess
their <HI>Natures, Births,</HI> and <HI>Conceptions</HI> to be all de|filed
with sin, and with a <HI>sinful proneness</HI> to all Ini|quity,
though <HI>miraculously</HI> some are Sanctified, or set
apart to God from the wombe as <HI>Ieremiah, Iohn the

<P>3. I must be briefer, though not so brief as I was

forced to be in our publick probations:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa|pists and Quakers agree against the holy Scripture</NOTE> I told them

in their Endeavours to raze the <HI>Records of

<HI>Inestimable Iewel</HI> and <HI>Treasure</HI> of the holy Scrip|tures.</P>
<P>1 The Papists own it not to be all the word or
will of God revealed, but that there be unwritten
Verities, that is, Gods mind revealed from Father to
Son, by Tradition.</P>
<P>The Quakers will not vouchsafe it the Name of
the word of God, out of a simple pretence, because
Christ is the word of God, that is, he isindeed the
chief manifestation of all the Appearances of God.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Papists</HI> horribly abuse it, calling it a Nose

And do not the <HI>Quakers</HI> as <HI>simply</HI> and <HI>bruitishly</HI> bind

Though they know the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek Cop|ies</HI>

<P>4. The <HI>Papists</HI> set up a Judge in Controversies
above the holy Scriptures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa|pists and Quakers Judge of Scripture</NOTE> who can dispense with
Scriptures and do all that God can do. And say not
the Quakers the same of their Spirit which is above

<P>5. The <HI>Papists</HI> though they will not deny to
make the Scriptures the Rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interpre|tation of Scripture</NOTE> and profess to be tried

<P>6 The <HI>Papists</HI> generally use not, nor have the

holy Scripture, (no not in their Devotions) in their

<P>He Answerred, I know not: but I am sure it is
agaiust us, and it is laid here for that purpose. Oh

<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> at first took off themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa|pists and Quakers would be rid of the Scripture</NOTE> <HI>Families</HI>

Crake that made the Scriptures supplies all, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
<HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI> both have said and printed, that
if the Scripture were consumed &amp; quite taken out of
the world, there would be no Loss, so long as they
have the Spirit. The Truth is I could by Arguments
many make it appear that the <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI>
love the holy Scriptures no better than <HI>Goliah</HI> loved

The <HI>Papists</HI> use the word <HI>Inherent Righteousness,</HI> but
the <HI>Quakers</HI> bogle at the word not finding it in the
<HI>English Bible,</HI> yet they agree that by the works of

under a hedge to themselves, and Crake that they
have received a pardon and Justification sealed un|der
the <HI>Broad Seal of Heaven</HI> to them, but it is
against the glory of <HI>the King of Heaven,</HI> and against
the glory of <HI>the Son of God,</HI> and his <HI>glorious Suffer|ings,</HI>
and their own <HI>Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>5 The <HI>Quakers</HI> are <HI>Papists</HI> in that Spirit of <HI>In|fallibility</HI>

<P>It is frequent in their Books, (when they will

others of them affirm that all Souls return into God,

as the Soul of <HI>Peter,</HI> yea others of [146] them speak

keep down heat and therefore I told them I would
not trouble them with <HI>Proofs</HI> from elsewhere, but
from their own <HI>writings,</HI> and from that of <HI>G. Fox</HI>

Cains,</HI> &amp;c. Thus they pretend <HI>Repentance, Faith,</HI>
and a change of heart because they have changed
their talk, their Garments, &amp;c. But,</P>
<P>1. I told them that true Repentance lay in a
discovery of sin as sin, as greater than the greatest
filthiness in the world: no poverty, no shame, no
loss like unto it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>2, In an utter inability to contribute one mite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What true turning to God is.</NOTE>
either from self,, or from the whole Creation to|ward
satisfaction to infinite Majesty and Justice for
the least evil thought or imagination.</P>
<P>3. <HI>That as blessed</HI> Iohn Bradford <HI>said to God:</HI>
Lord thou art Heaven, I am Hell, <HI>viz. that in the best
natural Soul in the World, there is nothing but a</HI>
Kennil, <HI>an</HI> Hogstie, <HI>a</HI> den of Atheisme, Murther, Theft,
Fornication, Adultery, and all kinde of Wickedness.</P>
<P>156] 4. That I have not so much in me as to de|sire
<HI>Deliverance,</HI> nor to be sensible of any need of it.</P>
<P>5. That it is only mercy and rich free Grace
that worketh in me or any Soul a Sence of my
Condition a Sence of Justice a Sence of Mercy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iacobs Ladder of true Chris|tianity.</NOTE></P>
<P>6. That it is Mercy only worketh a willingness,
a new desire, new Affections towards my Maker,
towards my Ransomer, who paid his <HI>Bloud,</HI> his
<HI>Heart-Bloud,</HI> the <HI>Bloud of God</HI> to ransome and re|deem
me.</P>
<P>7. That in this work, Mercy not only worketh
<PB N="237" REF="124">
a Sence, a thirst after Pardon and Peace with my
Maker, but also after a <HI>Conformity</HI> and <HI>Likeness</HI> unto
God.</P>
<P>8. Because I cannot reach this, the Mercy and
Pitty of God worketh in my Soul a longing after
God, and after the turning of the whole Soul unto
God, and after those seven Evidences of true Re|pentance,
2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.</P>
<P>9. This is in true Christian <HI>Repentance</HI> and turn|ing
of the whole Soul unto God, <HI>viz.</HI> to receive
every <HI>thought,</HI> every <HI>motion,</HI> every <HI>desire</HI> upon the
account of Mercy and Pitty, as ever poor Dog re|ceived
<HI>Crum</HI> or <HI>Bone</HI> under the Table.</P>
<P>Much of this I spake publickly, as also that no
<HI>Papist</HI> nor <HI>Quaker</HI> by their grounds could get up
this <HI>Iacobs Ladder,</HI> much less upon those higher
grounds and steps of casting off <HI>Self,</HI> of doing all
purely for God, and in Gods eye: of meekness and
Mercy to other poor drowning Soules, of pure Love
to God for <HI>Himself</HI> for his <HI>Holiness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd most mens Shipwrack</NOTE> <HI>Mercy, Goodness,</HI>

<P>I said and say, that neither the teachings of the

should be <HI>Cheated</HI> by this <HI>spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Any of those truely fearing <HI>God;</HI> for their
<HI>Principles spirit and practices</HI> being so notoriously
<PB N="241" REF="126">
opposite to the meek and patient <HI>Spirit</HI> of true
<HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers Spirit far from purity and Holiness.</NOTE> and evidencing them to be lead
by a dumb and dogged <HI>Spirit.</HI> 1. Their high and

of which in the next Position. 2. Their mouth
full of <HI>Cursing</HI> and <HI>Railing</HI> above any or all that
profess to march under the <HI>Christian Name</HI> and

fiercely against any as against the most conscienti|ous
<HI>Preachers</HI> and <HI>Professor</HI> of the <HI>Protestant Faith,</HI>
as appears all along in this railing of <HI>Fox</HI> in Folio
against them.</P>
<P>4. They easily fall in with openly profane and
ungodly <HI>persons,</HI> and with carnal and luke-warm
<HI>Laodiceans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spight og the Quakers Spirit</NOTE> who can swim with the tyde, sail with
every wind. If they can but say <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>5. It is wonderfull how their spirit (professing to
be <HI>Protestants</HI>) can so wickedly strike in with the
bloudy spirit of the <HI>Papists,</HI> against the Witnesses
and Martyrs of Jesus, compiled by that heavenly
<HI>I. Fox.</HI> in the Book of <HI>Martyrs</HI> which this bloudy
spirit (in <HI>Iames Purnels</HI> Watcher) upbraidingly
calls <HI>[Your Record]</HI> as if it were none of theirs, nor
the bloudy Papists, against whose bloudy practises
under their <HI>Popes,</HI> and the old proud <HI>Romans,</HI> the
<HI>Romane Gods</HI> and <HI>Emperours,</HI> that heavenly Book
shews how those heavenly <HI>Martyrs</HI> or <HI>Witnesses</HI> over
came by the <HI>Bloud of the Lamb,</HI> the word of their
<HI>Testimony,</HI> and not loving of their <HI>Lives</HI> unto the
<HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>6. That most Savage and worse then <HI>Indian
Spirit</HI> of their stripping their women stark naked,
<PB N="242" REF="127">
and so to enter into the <HI>streets</HI> and <HI>Assemblyes</HI> of
men and youths, which Piety <HI>Christianity</HI> and com|mon
<HI>Womanhood</HI> and <HI>Modesty</HI> abhor to think of.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> As I wonder how any <HI>godly Soul,</HI> so how
any <HI>Learned Soul,</HI> who hath studied the primitive
Copyes of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek Scriptures,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ignor|ance of the Quakers</NOTE> can
yoke with such rude <HI>Bablings</HI> and Repetitions of
simple ignorant <HI>Praters.</HI> Tis true the Lord Jesus
and his Embassadors were not all traind up as <HI>Paul</HI>
was at the feet of <HI>Gamaleel,</HI> yet had they before the
whole World the miraculous effusions of <HI>Fiery
Tongues,</HI> and heavenly Oyl upon them, which these
poor <HI>Simpletons</HI> ridiculously like Puppets in a Shew
pretend too. Beside, the <HI>Commons</HI> among the first
Christians were as learned if not more then our
primest <HI>Academians,</HI> the <HI>Hebrew</HI> being their Mother
Tongue, and the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> familiar, by the
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Romane Conquests</HI> over them, all which
Helps the most of the Leaders of the <HI>Quakers</HI> want,
only pretending to understand supernatural and
miraculously (in a trice and immediately) what is
to be gotten by honest and faithful labour and
industry, the holy will and mind of God from the
true Original Copies.</P>
<P>160] <HI>Thirdly,</HI> I do admire that any sober, modest
<HI>Woman</HI> (made so by nature, and much more by
Grace (should ever dare to come into their Assem|blies:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The abomi|nable Spi|rit of the Quakers nakedness</NOTE>

plainly (according to their Principles make the <HI>Na|kedness</HI>

<PB N="243" REF="127">
<HI>God,</HI> unto which they say they are restored by <HI>Christ
Iesus</HI> the second <HI>Adam.</HI> This <HI>Adamites Fowle spi|rit</HI>
is no <HI>New-come spirit,</HI> I have know nit almost
sixty year, and what a motion was made and urged
by some (whome I can name) for Plantations in
warmer <HI>Countreyes,</HI> where they might practice that
<HI>Ordinance of God</HI> viz, <HI>Of Nakedness of men and
women in Gods worship.</HI></P>
<P>These our <HI>Adamites</HI> are led by a more Savage
and Barbarous, and Monstrous Spirit, the which
under the vizird and mantle of Religion deceives
them, and of being a sign to others: And this
very bruitish practise have kept some Women (too
much inclin'd to them) from falling into their fil|thy
puddle, and of returning some which were left
by Gods Justice to go too far amongst them sure we
are the holy spirit of God (all along) abhors the
appearance of uncleanness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quakers driven on by the old Spirit of the Adam|ites</NOTE> and commands the vail|ings

<P>I have been too long upon the easiness of their
Religion, and of the agreement of it with corrupt
and rotten Nature which slides into it as easily as
Brooks and Rivers slide and run down into the
Ocean.</P>
<P>There be two other causes of falling into false
Religions or ways of worshipping God.</P>
<P>1. Hope of Gain, which was the <HI>Sechemites</HI> Bait:
(the sweet Musick propounded by <HI>Nebuchadnez|zar.</HI>)
&amp;c.</P>
<P>2. The fiery Furnace, &amp;c.</P>
<P>These moderate times have not driven the <HI>Qua|kers</HI>
to bow down to their Spirit for fear of perse|cution,
<PB N="244" REF="128">
and the fiery Furnace but Sathan knew
well enough that the Corruption of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rising of the Quakers</NOTE> and
the hope of Gain and Glory would cheat to pur|pose
(as all may see it hath done:) Sathan knows
that some have a moving and travelling Spirit, and
cannot rest in a sedentary or quiet life:) Some are
of a rising, aspiring Spirit (though neither from
Birth nor Breeding, nor abilities) and therefore cry
down all Honour or respect to be given to any
(but themselves) some are false and [161] rotten in
their <HI>Profession,</HI> and ready to fall and tumble when
any <HI>strange wind</HI> of Temptation blowes upon them.</P>
<P>7. Some may be <HI>Sincere</HI> and upright to God in
the <HI>Root,</HI> but <HI>Weak,</HI> and not so rooted in the <HI>Holy
Scriptures,</HI> as the Disciples themselves, who won|dered
for a time what the <HI>Rising</HI> from the dead
should mean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diverse Sorts suf|fered by God to fall into the Quak Ditch.</NOTE> and had need of their <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Mas|ters
Take heed and beware</HI> of the <HI>Leaven</HI> of the
<HI>Scribes,</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and <HI>Sadduces,</HI> &amp;c. Some
truly fear God, but have neglected the purity and
chastity of <HI>Gods holy Worship,</HI> and have reserved in
a weak Conscience a liberty of playing the <HI>Whore</HI>
against a jealous <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Husband.</HI></P>
<P>But generally they that are taken by the <HI>Quakers
Bait</HI> are such as never loved <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> in Sinceri|ty
as the Scripture speaketh, neither within nor
without, and therefore suckt in <HI>Nicolds</HI> and <HI>Nailors,</HI>
and <HI>Foxes</HI> dreames of a <HI>Christ,</HI> within them oppo|site
to <HI>Christ</HI> without:<NOTE PLACE="marg">But especi|ally for Male and Fe|male Pro|testants.</NOTE> of a <HI>Christ</HI> a <HI>Light</HI> a <HI>Spirit</HI>
within, which had no <HI>Humane Body,</HI> or if he were
humane, or a man they know not now what is be|come
of him.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="128">
The <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> tels us that some will plead with
him at the last day, that they have heard him
<HI>Preach,</HI> that they have been at his <HI>Table,</HI> that they
have prophesied themselves, <HI>cast out Devils</HI> in his
Name, and in his Name done many <HI>Wonderfull
things:</HI>
should not this make every Soul that calls
it self <HI>Christian,</HI> startle and look about them, especi|ally
when they hear Christ Jesus say, <HI>depart from me
I know you not ye workers of Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>I told the Quakers that their <HI>Theora Iohn</HI> pretended
to write after the <HI>Spirits</HI> Dictate, a volume in <HI>He|brew,
Greek, Latine, Arminiack,</HI> &amp;c. which he con|fessed
he understood not: what if it should please

work great <HI>Miracles,</HI> yet if they come under the
Note Christ gives them, of <HI>Workers of Iniquity,</HI>
they fulfill the termes of my <HI>Position,</HI> and prove but
<HI>False</HI> and <HI>Reprobate.</HI></P>
<P>This is the true and infallible distinguishing
<HI>Character</HI> between the true <HI>Legitimate</HI> and the <HI>Bas|tard</HI>
and false <HI>Christian:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great distinguish|ing Cha|racter of true and false Pretenders</NOTE> The soul of the <HI>True</HI>

in his eye: The soul of the <HI>False</HI> is broken for
Sin as bringing temporal Loss or shame, or pain,
and beside temporal, Eternal. The soul of the
true, is broke off from Sin, from the least Sin, [162
from the appearances of sin from the occasions of
Sin, from the thought of Sin as worse then all the
Afflictions of this life, or the Torments of Hell
to come. The soul of the False, hath secret Friend|ship
and Correspondence with Iniquity (as <HI>Church-Papists</HI>

with Popery &amp;c) in the secret chambers and
Closets of the heart, at which they willingly wink,
and to find it (when they are put to it, yea and seem
to doe it) they are willingly remiss and negligent.</P>
<P>Hence it was a famous Principle of the first <HI>New-English
Reformers,</HI> viz. to be Christianly carefull
that their Members gave <HI>Christian Evidence,</HI> (so far
as godly eyes of Charity could reach) of the truth
of their Conversion and turning unto God, which
for ought I know is not changed by their Suc|cessors.</P>
<P>It is dolefully true that many seemingly <HI>Elect,</HI>
prove <HI>Reprobate,</HI> and many truly <HI>Elect</HI> fall into many
great <HI>Sins</HI> and <HI>Sorrows.</HI> How black and dolefull
then is their Condition (such as the <HI>Papists</HI> the
<HI>Quakers</HI> and others) whose <HI>Religion Principles</HI> and
<HI>Practices,</HI> arise no higher then what a <HI>Reprobate</HI>
may attain unto.</P>
<P>We came to the tenth <HI>Position,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The 3d Position debated at <HI>Provi|dence.</HI></NOTE> (the third in or|der

<PB N="247" REF="129">
take a short turn of a quarter of an hour, I am
now at more liberty of inserting what I intended,
but was forced to abbridge wlth all possible brevity
at that time.</P>
<P><HI>I told them there was a</HI> pride <HI>in</HI> outward <HI>and ex|ternal

fall to all eternity.</P>
<P>I named then diverse Parallels between the <HI>Popes</HI>
and <HI>Quakers,</HI> I will now name all I can remember
I named, and will name some more at this present,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Popes</HI> have exalted themselves above
all that is called <HI>God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Popes &amp; Qua|kers pride compared</NOTE> above all <HI>Civill powers, Kings</HI>

<P>Beside, W. E. (a man fit to make a <HI>Bonefacius</HI> or

and Deity, Maker of all things, yet they acknowl|edge
(as other famous <HI>Civilized Nations</HI> formerly

that as their garments hang loose about their

So that (to my knowledge) they are so far from
hindring any to come to God, that when they have
seen the grave and solemn <HI>Worship</HI> of the <HI>English,</HI>
they have often said of themselves and their own,
that they are all one <HI>Dogs</HI> in comparison of the
<HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The second sort of men are the <HI>Civill</HI> brought to

one God and supream <HI>Deity:</HI> but they differ in
two things, 1. In the <HI>Prophet</HI> or Meanes by whome

(from within the <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> tells us) proceed all
the rotten and hellish <HI>Speeches</HI> and <HI>Actions.</HI></P>
<P>172] I told them it was in this case as it was with
<HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes,</HI> there were two great Enemyes
that haunted the Pallaces of Kings and Princes. 1.
<HI>Traiterous Spyes &amp;c. 2. Traiterous Flatterers.</HI></P>
<P>Just here it was (as I remember) that <HI>W. Ed|mundson</HI>
stopt me saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flatterers of Kings</NOTE> thou hast here been tell|ing
us Storyes of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Iewes,</HI> but what is that
to thy Charge against us? we are none of those
that flatter <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes,</HI> we deal plainly with
all men.</P>
<P>I said they mistook me: for I did not say they
slattered Kings, I used a similitude only, viz. that as
<HI>Flatterers,</HI> &amp;c. of Kings and great men, were their
deadliest Foes, so such Religions and Doctrines as
most slatter and sooth up our rotten hearts and na|tures
they are most dangerous and destructive to us:
I intended to add that the <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended to be
as fine Flower sifted out from the <HI>common Protest|ants,</HI>
<PB N="262" REF="137">
yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whor|ish Quak|ers, and whore of Rome.</NOTE> from the <HI>Independants &amp; Baptists,</HI> that

Humiliation.</P>
<P>I did say as the <HI>Whore</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> deceived whole

<P>There are two sorts of godly Soules catcht up a

<P>A famous <HI>Iesuit</HI> prints it, that all the Religion

<P>As to the saving of Souls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earthly &amp; Heavenly Sword</NOTE> it was a Thunder from

as foolish Children and Anticks in the Lord Mayors

<P>We now descended to the fifth and sorrowful
point of suffering which they read,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 5th. of the last 7 positions</NOTE> <HI>viz. [That the

<P>At the reading of this they told me, that although

Lord had sent them, yet they made not their <HI>Suf|fering</HI>
an Evidence of the truth of their <HI>Religion,</HI> &amp;
<PB N="266" REF="139">
therefore I might have been better advised then to

<P>I Answered, that I understood what they said, and
I undestood mine own affirmation also; and de|sired
their patience also while I offered my Proofs
to two Particulars,</P>
<P>1. That in their <HI>Books</HI> and <HI>Writings &amp;c.</HI> they do
make their <HI>Sufferings</HI> a great Evidence to them|selves
and others of the truth of their <HI>Way</HI> and
<HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>2. This their <HI>Suffering</HI> is not valid as to the
proof of their <HI>Religion, Way</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> to be of
God. So then they bid me prove it if I could.</P>
<P>I told them that I could find no <HI>Iewes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pauls and the Quak suffrings</NOTE> no <HI>Pa|pists</HI>
no <HI>Protestants,</HI> that did so magnifie and so ex|actly
insist upon their <HI>Sufferings</HI> as the <HI>Quakers</HI> did.
Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rue that <HI>Paul</HI> did more particularize his Suf|ferings
then other Saints in Scripture; but it was
also true that they were so exceeding great that
<HI>Paul</HI> seemed a <HI>None-Such;</HI> but beside that it was
upon some great <HI>Insultings</HI> of the <HI>False Apostles</HI>
against not only himself, but against the Truth of
Christ Jesus: neither of which is the <HI>Quakers</HI> case.
Beside, the <HI>Quakers Sufferings</HI> generally were not to
be compar'd with <HI>Pauls,</HI> and yet they set down such
exact accounts of every <HI>hour</HI> in prison every <HI>Stripe</HI>
in <HI>Whipping,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quak. sufferings in Hystory of G. Bis|hop re|corded.</NOTE>

our</HI> Persecutors wickedness, <HI>and our</HI> Christian Faith
and Patience, <HI>who for his Truths sake can endure all
this.</HI> I said it was not rational to think, that men
professing such high <HI>Wisdome</HI> and <HI>Conscience,</HI> should
declare such <HI>Lysts</HI> and <HI>Catalogues</HI> of <HI>Sufferings</HI> (as
<HI>G. Bishop</HI> doth to the world, of the <HI>Quakers Suffer|ings
in N. England,</HI> in his first and second <HI>History</HI>)
only in a childish Vapour, Ostentation and Vain-Glory,
much less in hopes of <HI>Reparation</HI> or any
worldly advantage, either in <HI>England</HI> old or new,
<HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Virginia,</HI> &amp;c. and therfore Reason per|swades
that these Sufferings are held forth (as the
holy Spirit speaks of the Sufferings of the <HI>Thessa|lonians,</HI>
2. Thess. 2.) as a manifest Token of the
<HI>righteous judgment of God</HI> rendering <HI>Tribulation</HI> to
their Persecutors, and <HI>Rest</HI> to themselves suffering
for the <HI>Kingdome</HI> of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>As I remember, <HI>Iohn Stubs</HI> said, they did not
boast of their [176] Sufferings, but bare them pa|tiently
for the Truths sake which they preached
and professed.</P>
<P>I said I did not charge them to say in express
terms, We have lost so much outward <HI>Gain, Favour,
Friendship, Worldly Advantage</HI> for the Name of
Christ within us, can you say the like for the Christ
without you? We have endured <HI>Imprisonments,
Whippings, &amp;c.</HI> have you done the like? only this
I say, that as all <HI>Religios Iewes, Papists, Protestants
&amp;c.</HI> are confirmed in their Perswations by their
<HI>Sufferings,</HI> and do predicate them to others as <HI>Ar|guments</HI>
and <HI>Signs</HI> of the truth of their <HI>Doctrines,</HI>
and of Gods presence and Assistance with them: so
<PB N="268" REF="140">
do the <HI>Quakers</HI> and that with more Particular and
exact <HI>Accounts</HI> then most of all the rest have done.</P>
<P>I told them, I had observed much to this pur|pose
in <HI>G. Fox</HI> &amp; <HI>E. Burrowes</HI> in the Book by me.</P>
<P><HI>They bid me alleadge what I could out of them:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Bur|rowes</HI> his Epistle quoted.</NOTE>
<HI>I took up the Book, and they theirs, I directed
them to the</HI> 12th. <HI>Page of</HI> Ed. Burrowes <HI>his large</HI>
Epistle <HI>to</HI> G. Fox <HI>his Book in Folio where I read
this passage viz.</HI> And this we did with no small oppo|sition
and Danger: yea oftentimes we were in danger
of our Lives, through beating, abusing, punishing, hal|ing,
casting over walls, striking with staves &amp; Cudgels,
and knocking down to the ground: Beside, <HI>Reproach|ing,
Scorning, Revilings, Hooting at,</HI> Scornings and
Slanderings, and all abuse that could be thought or
acted by evil hands and tongues, and oft carried before
<HI>Magistrates</HI> with grievous Threats, and sometimes put
in the Stocks, and whipped, and often imprisoned, and
many hard dealings against us, the worst that tongues
or hands could execute, sparing life. Of this all the
<HI>North Countreys</HI> can witness. And all these things
are sustained and suffered from People and Rulers be|cause
of our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to the Lord, and for declar|ing
against the false Deceivers. For nothing save only
the hand of the Lord and his power, could have pre|served
us and carried us through all this: neither for
any <HI>Reward</HI> outward whatsoever, or advantage to our
selves would we have exposed our selves to suffrings,
violence and dangers which befel us daily. But the
Lord was our exceeding great reward through all these
things, and kept us in the hollow of his hand, and un|der
the shadow of his wings, and gave us dominion in
<PB N="269" REF="140">
Spirit over all our enemies, and subdued them before us:
and though Rulers and People were combined against us,
and executed their violence and in- [177] justice against
us, yet the Lord made us to prosper and grow exceedingly
in Strength, Wisdome and Number, and the hearts of
the people inclined to us, and the Witness of God in
many stirred for us: for to that in all Consciences,
Words and wayes we did commend our selves to be known
and approved.</P>
<P>Hereto they suddenly said, What canst thou
make of this, but that <HI>Edward Burrowes</HI> said the
truth, that the Sufferings of the people called <HI>Qua|kers</HI>
were very great, &amp; that he acknowledged the
powerfull hand of the Lord toward them in sup|porting
and delivering them: But this was far
from boasting or making it any <HI>Evidence</HI> of the
truth of their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Principles.</HI></P>
<P>I replyed, I prayed them to consider why pious
and conscientious Souls (as they would be reputed)
should give so large a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of their <HI>Sufferings.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quo|tation weighed.</NOTE>
2. Profess it was only for their <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to the
Lord. 3. Declare that it was the hand of the Lord
that kept them, 4, That he only could do it: I
sayd the <HI>Weaving</HI> and <HI>inter-weaving</HI> of these Par|ticulars,
speak plainly that for their <HI>Faithfullness</HI> to
the Lord and his Truth in declaring and suffering
for it, the Lord had been faithfull to them in sup|porting
them and comforting them in all these Suf|ferrings
for his Name sake. Why should wise men
use all these words but to this end, of <HI>Evidencing</HI>
their <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to God, and Gods <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to
them.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="141">
After some words had about these kind of pas|sages
in <HI>Ed. Burrowes</HI> and other of their Writings,
I told them that we must come to that ancient and
true Maxime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What true Suffering is.</NOTE> <HI>Causa facit Martyrem,</HI> not the Suf|fering
of <HI>Burning</HI> it self that is the evidence of a

<P>I told them that I had other places which I had
turned down in <HI>Edward Burrowes</HI> to produce; but
these I had suppressed in my thoughts for expedi|tion
sake, and would if they pleased pass on to my
proof of my next <HI>Position,</HI> to this they readily as|sented:
but being now out of my Shackles of a
quarter of an hour (to which I wink'd to draw
them on) I crave the Readers Patience and leave to
hear me say something now which then I could
not say.</P>
<P>178] First.<NOTE PLACE="marg">True Scripture Language.</NOTE> To what I have said before of <HI>E.
Burrowes</HI> insisting so largly on the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of the
<HI>Quakers,</HI> and yet my <HI>Antagonists</HI> denying them to
make their Sufferings an <HI>Evidence</HI> of their <HI>Truth,</HI> I
present the Reader with a witness of <HI>G. Fox</HI> his
words in his <HI>Pag 64, [And there is a Proof to thee
that the</HI> Quakers <HI>are sent of God who speak to thee of
the Scripture right as they are]</HI> He that reads the
place shall see that <HI>G. Fox</HI> useth these words against
his Opposite <HI>Ieremiah Iewes,</HI> because that his Op|posite
<PB N="271" REF="141">
had said, viz. That the <HI>Word of God</HI> was con|tained
in the <HI>Scripture:</HI> and <HI>G. Fox</HI> checks him for
it and saith if he had said [the word which it speaks
of] he had spoken right <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this <HI>G. Fox</HI>
makes an <HI>Evidence</HI> of the <HI>Quakers</HI> being sent of
God, that they only can speak <HI>properly.</HI> How
much more is what I have produced (and have
much more to produce) a <HI>Proof</HI> that they do roll
their Souls upon their <HI>Sufferings</HI> as an <HI>Evidence</HI> and
Confirmation that they are sent of God?</P>
<P>2. It is wonderfull what the <HI>Iewes</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI>
have suffered for their <HI>Lyes</HI> and <HI>Blasphemyes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The won|derfull Sufferings of Here|ticks</NOTE> What

a natural <HI>Melancholy</HI> and <HI>Stoutness,</HI> a natu|ral
<HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Vain-Glory</HI> will give wings which fire
and Burning cannot scorch and conquer.</P>
<P>3. I doubt not but that tis possible for not only
<HI>Christians,</HI> but also <HI>Iewes</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> &amp;c. like <HI>Paul</HI>
in his mad <HI>Conscience,</HI> to be zealous for his <HI>Con|science,</HI>
and to put others to death for their <HI>Con|sciences,</HI>
and yet neither of them to sin against their
<HI>Consciences,</HI> but ignorantly as <HI>Paul</HI> did.</P>
<P>4. I believe that not only <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great fail|ings of Gods Chil|dren in this life.</NOTE> and such as he,
in Unbelief may so practice, but even the true
Saints and Children of God. He that shall ponder
the Fathers <HI>Poligamy,</HI> the best Kings of <HI>Iudah</HI> suf|fering
the <HI>High places, Davids</HI> slaying <HI>Uriah, Asahs</HI>
imprisoning the <HI>Prophet, Peters</HI> rash using the Sword,
<PB N="272" REF="142">
<HI>Davids</HI> and <HI>Nathans</HI> unadvised <HI>Advise</HI> to build God
a Temple, the <HI>Disciples</HI> calling for Fire from Hea|ven,

their rash damning of others from whome they
have suffered. For,</P>
<P>5. As tis possible for Gods own Children to hold,
and that [179] obstinately, false <HI>Principles,</HI> so it is
possible for other of Gods Children as obstinately
to afflict and punish those others to <HI>Death,</HI> and so
bring <HI>Affliction</HI> and <HI>Destruction</HI> one upon an other
which is that the Devil aimes at.</P>
<P>6. Because the <HI>Quakers</HI> do so abundantly glory
in their <HI>Sufferers,</HI> and (in comparison of them)
slight the <HI>Saints</HI> under the <HI>Altar</HI> (in our <HI>Book of
Martyrs,</HI> as <HI>Iames Parnel</HI> impiously calls it) casting
all that differ from them into the <HI>Satanical Delu|sion,</HI>
and <HI>Serpentine nature,</HI> as <HI>Fox</HI> doth, <HI>Pag. 5. and</HI>
253. and 99. Who forbids to receive into their

<P>First, The Persons whome the heavenly man
<HI>Iohn Fox</HI> describes, they were men and women
known to be of holy and heavenly Spirits towards
God, and of low and meek Spirits towards all, yea
their very enemyes. I would I could say so of the

<PB N="273" REF="142">
I have cause to fear that generally they are

Some of them have literal <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI>
and some stirring <HI>Affections</HI> with the stony

<P>The Cause of <HI>Iohn Foxes</HI> and <HI>G. Foxes</HI> Martyrs

gallant, yet their lowliness and humility did shine
forth gloriously also.</P>
<P>1. As to God, being more sensible of their sins

<HI>Lambs</HI> and <HI>Chickins</HI>) yet they had deserved and
calld for this Storm by their unthankfulness for
their former peace and liberties, by their drowsiness
and sleeping upon the Earthen bed of worldly
Profits and Pleasures.</P>
<P>Contrarily it is known to all, that although some|times
the <HI>Quakers</HI> will say we come in love to your

Souls yet (the <HI>Quakers</HI> are far from confessing their
sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Devilish pride</NOTE> as having no more sin then God hath, and
(according to their Principles and some of them
say it) they can no more sin against God then God
can sin against them.</P>
<P>As to Men Christs sufferers were meek, patient;
respective, contented, thankful.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>Quakers</HI> hearts have an insensible
brawniness and hardness (like frozen Rivers come
over their hearts) in matters of God so as to men.</P>
<P>181] 1. Was there ever a People (Men and Wo|men
professing such an height of Christianity) so
fierce so heady, so high-minded and though gener|ally
not hardned) so censuring, reviling, cursing and

<P>Tis true some of their Predictions have and may
come to pass as do many also of <HI>Conjurers &amp; Witch|es,</HI>
for the Devil knows the Complexion of persons
and things, and what is like to come to pass (as in

Mr. <HI>I. Dod</HI> used to say, <HI>though the Devil was up
early, God was still up before him:</HI> for the Proverb is
here true, <HI>God hath sent curst Cows short Horns:</HI> his

When the Devil is a <HI>Fisher</HI> longing for troubled and
bloody waters, yet God hath graciously proved
many of the bloody prophesies of his waspish Pro|phets

<P><HI>We now descended to the thirteenth Proposal

<P>I told them that I had not shun'd (as in the

I could never pick out any Wheat (of solid, rational
and heavenly Truth) out of their heaps of Chaffe,

Spirits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is true that <HI>W. Edmund.</HI> said, that the Word
of the Lord [182] was a Fire, and a Hammer, &amp;c.
But I said the word they meant was but a painted
Fire, and a painted Hammer, and that never broke
nor burned up sin as sin.</P>

<P>But in the <HI>Quakers Books &amp; Writings, Peter &amp;

<P>Let <HI>Io. Chandlers</HI> Writings, and the Writings of

&amp;c. And I could readily and abundantly prove my
position out of all of them, but my desire and inten|tion
was (as by my Paper to <HI>G. Fox</HI> appears) to
have made it good to <HI>G. Fox</HI> himself, and to all
Christians, how poor and lame, and naked <HI>G. Fox</HI>
his writings are, who seems to be as <HI>Pighius</HI> and
<HI>Echius</HI> amongst the <HI>Papists,</HI> and as <HI>Bellarmine</HI> the
greatest Writer amongst them.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="145">
I told my <HI>Opposites</HI> I would therefore Answer

<P>2. I observe throughout his Book a Devillish
<HI>Black Line</HI> of despising those that are Good (as the
Scripture speaketh) He counts none Godly but him|self
and his <HI>Foxians:</HI> yea there is no <HI>God,</HI> no <HI>Christ,</HI>
no <HI>Spirit,</HI> but what is in him and them feelingly,

and the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and the Kingdome of God,
which they confess consists in Righteousness and

impiously and simply speaks) these Inhabitants and
Hosts to all these Guests know nothing of their

<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> gives a shrewd suspition that he never knew
what the true fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ex|cellent men.</NOTE> and love, and peace, and joy of
God mean; if he did, is it possible that he could
puff at so many Writers (excellent for great Know|ledge
and godliness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whom G F in his book in fo|lio tramp|leth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n as Dishclouts Dogs &amp; Devils</NOTE> denying any thing of God or

some of them (eminent servants of God) I have
known: of others of them I have smelt the <HI>sweet
Odour</HI> of an Heavenly report from the mouthes of

<P>But as <HI>G. Fox</HI> will be found to adore an <HI>Image

say of others will his Faith, his Love, his Spirit of
Discerning, and <HI>Hope of Glory</HI> and <HI>Salvation</HI> prove
(without Repentance) dolefully false in the latter

doth the Lord inspire his holy Pen-men to write
these holy Histories: was it to shame his Saints de|parted,
or to shame his own Holiness, and to cast a
stumbling block, and a protection for after sinners and
transgressors? or amongst other holy ends to teach
us (like <HI>Moses</HI>) to distinguish between an <HI>Egyptian</HI>

Copper of Hypocrisie; yea, and to give the best

it will pass currant in Earth and Heaven with God,
and such who truly know and love him.</P>
<P>But with <HI>G. Fox.</HI> in all this great Book, the most

him but <HI>Vipers, Serpents, Cains, Iudasses, false Pro|phets,
Pharisees, dumb Dogs, Sorcerers, Witches, Re|probates,
Devils, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>3. In this Book of <HI>G. Fox</HI> (all along) he denies
the <HI>Scripture</HI> to be the Word of God: and he said,
that every man in the world hath that Spirit that
gave forth <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and that all Saints are [185
acted by the same Spirit immediately that moved
the Prophets and Apostles and holy Pen-men of
the holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> all tending to <HI>vilifie</HI> and <HI>nullifie</HI>
the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, his <HI>Impiety</HI> in these Assertions (which
half an eye of <HI>Mahumetans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fox his subtilty and yet simplicity in granting the Script&punc; to be the words of God.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; Iewes, &amp; Papists, &amp;

though he be crafty is but a Beast still) For out of
his <HI>Piety</HI> he grants the holy Scriptures through all
his Book to be the <HI>Words of God,</HI> though not the
<HI>Word of God:</HI> and for this his Grant he quotes
<HI>Exod. 20. God spake all these Words,</HI> and the four
Books of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> which I nor my Opposites
could tell in publick what to make of: But if they
are the <HI>Words</HI> of God, and fome of them fearfully

every grain of gold is gold, and every drop in the
Ocean is Water and Salt too, as I urged to them
before concerning every word that proceedeth out
of the mouth of God) else the <HI>Words of God</HI> when
brought to particular examination, they are not the
word of <HI>God,</HI> but of <HI>Angels</HI> or <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Devills.</HI></P>
<P>How sweet are (not Words but) right Words:
every man shall kiss his lips that gives a right An|swer,
how dirty then, how filthy and bloudy are
those Lips that in so many places, debating with so
many wise and learned and pious men, drop not
<HI>Honey</HI> and <HI>Milk,</HI> but <HI>Wormwood</HI> and <HI>Gall</HI> the <HI>Venome</HI>
and the <HI>Poyson</HI> of Asps to them that lick up such
deceitfull and destroying <HI>Doctrines.</HI></P>
<P>4. In <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Book I observe that all along
he notoriously nibbles ar <HI>VVords</HI> and quarrels at
<HI>VVords,</HI> which he saith are not <HI>Scripture,</HI> as that
wicked word <HI>[Humane]</HI> relating to the Person of the
Son of God and man.</P>
<P>Also the word <HI>Trinity</HI> and <HI>Sacrament.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The word Humane abominable above all words to the Qua|kers</NOTE> Oh how
zealous is this <HI>Fox</HI> for the purity of <HI>Language?</HI>
Why may not the word <HI>Humane</HI> be used as well as
the word <HI>Sabboth</HI> and <HI>Sabbaoth,</HI> and <HI>Bethlebem</HI> and
<HI>Ierusalem</HI> which are Hebrew words, and as well as
the words <HI>Baptisme</HI> and <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> which are
Greek words, <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Scriptures</HI> and <HI>Pretorium</HI>
which are Latine words. That word <HI>Humane</HI> is
odious <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> sake, and therefore the

of God in Flesh, in that personal, Indi|vidual

<P>5. I observe the loose and wild Spirit of <HI>G. Fox</HI>
in dealing with so many heavenly <HI>Champions,</HI> the
Leaps and Skips like a wild <HI>Satyre</HI> or <HI>Indian,</HI> catch|ing
and snapping at here and there a Sentence, like

<P>6. Any sober Soul may read in most of their

<P>G. Fox <HI>Answers</HI> [Though the Scripture saith the
Spirit dwells in the Saints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sam. Eaton.</NOTE> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. And he that is
joyned to the Lord is one Spirit, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. As though
the Saints had not Union with God which the Scrip|ture
say they have.]</P>
<P>I Reply: concerning the <HI>Essence</HI> or <HI>Being</HI> of the
Immortal, Invisible, Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent,
and Omniscient, and only Wise: we know no more
then a Fly knows what a King is, and therefore 1

to:</HI> how fully doth the Holy Spirit in the
Book of <HI>Iob,</HI> and especially in that dreadful Word
or Voice of God in a <HI>Whirlwind</HI> knock out the
brains of all these proud Fancies? let this proud
<HI>Fox,</HI> or any of the stoutest <HI>Lions or Lionesses</HI>
amongst them, look but a few minutes upon the
glorious Sun in the Heavens, and then tell us how
their eyes do: and yet thus like proud and prat|ling
Children do they make a noise about their
<HI>Bibs,</HI> and <HI>Aprons,</HI> and <HI>Muckingers:</HI> and how they
are one with God his <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Essence,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Is it not enough for Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods being out of our reach</NOTE> Moon and Stars, and
Men to be enlightned by his Infinity, but they
must be God himself, and Light it self, in the high|est
sence, because God is Light, &amp;c.</P>
<P>What impudence would it be in a Wife, because
she is one with her Husband in Relation, to say,
She is the Husband himself, and not to keep her
just distinction and distance? or in a Subject (be|cause
the Subjects and the <HI>King</HI> are Relatives, and
in a sence one) [189] therefore to say, that they are
the <HI>King himself.</HI></P>
<P>Again, we know that the word <HI>Spirit</HI> is taken in
<HI>Holy Scripture</HI> for a <HI>Spiritual Nature.</HI> Hence it is
said that God is a Spirit, not that God is properly
a Spirit, no more then he is Light (though my
Opposites in our Dispute affirmed he was) but of
such a Heavenly and Spiritual Nature:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of Spirits</NOTE> For the
Devils also are Spirits, though defiled with sin and
wickedness: thus <HI>Ioh. 3. That which is born of the
Spirit is Spirit,</HI> not that Spirits beget Spirits, and
<PB N="288" REF="151">
that a new Creature is a young holy Spirit or God
himself, as I told one of the chief of the <HI>Quakers</HI>
at <HI>Newport,</HI></P>
<P>And that 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. shews us in what respect he
that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit: For know
you not (saith <HI>Paul) that your Bodies are the Temples
of the Holy Spirit:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How God and Christ of is in us.</NOTE> and <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. For an Habita|tion
of God through the Spirit.</P>
<P>Thus God dwelt in his Temple of old, as a Man
in his House and a King in his Palace: not that a
Mans House, or the Kings Palace is of his Sub|stance
or Essence no more then an house is of the
Suns Essence, &amp;c. and no more was Gods Temple
of old, nor his Temples his Saints now, after the
blockish and blasphemous nonsence of the <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In Page</HI> 2.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sam. Eaton</NOTE> <HI>He brings in</HI> Sam Eaton <HI>saying</HI> [The
Scripture is to be judge of Doctrines and Manners.]</P>
<P>G. Fox <HI>Answers</HI> [The Iews had not the infallible
Iudgement, that had Scripture but stood against Christ
the Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scrip|ture the Rule.</NOTE> and judged him to be a Devil, that judge|ment
was not infallible, and that Doctrine and Man|ners
of theirs was not right which goes against Christ
the Light.]</P>
<P>I Reply, as the Sun in the Heavens is the Epi|tomy
or Center of all Natural Light, though some
eyes are sore, look a squint, or are stark blinde.</P>
<P>And as the Rule or Canon (though <HI>Fox</HI> simply
bogles at that as not a Scripture word) is the same,
for it is in the Greek, though millions know it not,
and millions (as the <HI>Pharises</HI>) pervert and mis|apply
it.</P>
<P>The Holy Scripture is granted by <HI>G. Fox</HI> to be

Gods Words (though in a subtle fancie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holy Scripture a Lanthorn</NOTE> not his

wilfully refuse it (as some sometimes do Lanthorns)
and wilfully stumble [190] into the Ditch Eternal,

Sun-Dial is one and constant in its guidance and
direction to us poor Travellers, though we neglect
to look on it, or be ignorant of the figures and
lines of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Try all things</NOTE> and be willingly ignorant, &amp;c.</P>
<P>We are not only commanded to read and medi|tate
in the Holy Scriptures, and to search them as
the <HI>Bereans</HI> did, but we are commanded to try all
things, to try the very Spirits. The <HI>Papists</HI> slap us
in the mouth with the infallible Spirit of the <HI>Pope,</HI>
and that he is not to be judged: the <HI>Quakers</HI> say the
same of themselves, which is no more then as I
said in the Dispute (when <HI>W, Edmund.</HI> interrupted
me, crying out <HI>Blasphemy</HI>) for a Man to go for
Counsel to an arrant Cheater and Jugler (then
cheating most when he calls all others Cheaters.)</P>
<P><HI>In Page</HI> 3.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sam Eaton</NOTE> <HI>He brings in the same Author saying</HI>
[That God did not intend immediate Teaching, nor to

which saith, All the people of the Lord shall be
taught of the Lord, and he that is of God heareth
Gods word, and that is immediate and living, and
doth endure for ever, there is no fallibility nor de|lusion
in the Revelation of God, but all fallibility

<P><PB N="290" REF="152">
I Reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods medi|ate teach|ings his word &amp; voice mani|fold and specified.</NOTE> it is granted that God speaks medi|ately
unto us by the light of Nature within us;
doth not nature teach you that it is a shame for a

<P>2. By his works of Creation.</P>
<P>3. His Providence without us in his mercies and

<P>And 4. The pains of the Body, and Dreams in

hears it not and is not Gods speaking his Word?</P>
<P>And 5, All grant that the words of Scripture are
the words of God.</P>
<P>And 6. The teachings of men, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4. are grant|ed
to be means, &amp;c. both for the gathering of the
Church, as <HI>Apostles,</HI> and for the Governing of the
Flocks, as <HI>Pastors and Shepherds,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>191] 7. The Water, the Bread, the Wine, &amp;c. are
appointed by Christ Jesus to be means while pro|fession
of Christ Jesus is made on earth to hold
forth a remembrance of him until his second
coming.</P>
<P>8. The private <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Fastings</HI> and <HI>Medi|tations</HI>
of the Saints day and night, are holy <HI>Meanes</HI>
in and by which the Eternal God speaks Peace, In|struction,
Reproof and Comfort to to them that fear
him.</P>
<P>9. Sometimes it pleaseth God by the Ministration
of his <HI>Ministring Spirits</HI> (the invisible Angels) to
work by unknown and unseen wayes to us: thus in

to <HI>Paul</HI> (as <HI>Peter</HI> to <HI>Cornelius</HI>) and <HI>Paul</HI> to the
<HI>Iailor,</HI> it pleased God to use his holy means and
instruments of Men to men (Gods sweet and fa|miliar
way to men: the immediate Teachings of
God by <HI>Dreams,</HI> by <HI>Vision,</HI> by <HI>Voices, by</HI> Motion, the
<HI>Holy Scripture</HI> mentions many before and since the
coming of the Lord Jesus, the Question is not
whether it may not please the most Holy and in|finite
<HI>Prerogative</HI> of the most High,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Immediate teachings</NOTE> so to teach
where, and when, and whom he please.</P>
<P>But whether it be Christian obedience, or Dia|bolical
laziness to fling off all means (as <HI>Fox</HI> all
along teacheth) to sit still and listen to immediate
Teachings (that is say I to the Devils whisperings)
I believe the <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI> would give much
to be rid of the Scriptures: I know also, that not|withstanding
their pretence of Spirit, yet both of
them are forced to use means, Praying, Preaching,
Congregating, and (in stead of the holy means
by Gods Spirit) have appointed many Inventions
and Superstitions from a Satanical Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> saith, there is no Fallacy in the <HI>Revela|tion</HI>
of God?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> True, but will he say these seven things:</P>
<P>1. That all the pretended <HI>Revelations</HI> are the
Revelations of God.</P>
<P>2. That <HI>Revelations</HI> may not pretend <HI>Angelical
Light,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Revelati|ons con|sidered in 7 particu|lars</NOTE> and yet be <HI>Diabolical Darkness.</HI></P>
<P>3. That we may receive any <HI>Revelations</HI> and
<PB N="292" REF="153">
<HI>Teachings</HI> (as Children and Mad Folks do) without
chewing, and rational weighing &amp; consideration.</P>
<P>4. That God hath not appointed his old Scrip|ture
and Writing [192] new since Christs coming
as a <HI>Standard, Rule</HI> or <HI>Touch stone</HI> to try all our own
and others Inspirations by?</P>
<P>5. That <HI>Mahomets Inspirations</HI> are not one of
the most prevailing Snares, Traps, and Engines,
whereby he hath catcht whole Nations and King|domes,
and the greatest part of this poor world at
this day.</P>
<P>6. That when God reveals his word or will in wri|ting
(which <HI>G. Fox</HI> grants to be the words of God,
and they are slighted) it is not common and most
righteous with God to deliver up proud lazy Souls
to strong Delusions to believe Lyes (as at this day
it is most wonderfull)</P>
<P>7. Whether there be any way in this world to
escape the snares of <HI>Sathans Whisperings</HI> but by
humble attending to the search and Meditation of
the heavenly <HI>Records,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great business of Revela|tions</NOTE> by humble cryes to the Fa|ther

4. <HI>Where he brings in the same Author</HI> Sam Eaton
<HI>saying,</HI> [The Gospel is the Letter, &amp;c.] <HI>He Answers,</HI>
[And the Apostle saith, it is the power of God &amp;c. and
the Letter kills, and many may have the Form but deny
the Power, and so stand against the Gospel which is
the Power of God.</P>
<P>I reply, we all know that the word <HI>Gsopel</HI> from
<PB N="293" REF="153">
the old <HI>Saxon</HI> is as strange to us <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What is the Gospel</NOTE> as the word
<HI>Evangelium</HI> or <HI>Euangelion</HI> (the Latine and Greek)
are: but we all agree that it may be turned (accord|ing
to its meaning) <HI>Glad Newes.</HI> This wise cunning
man tels us the <HI>Glad Newes</HI> is not the <HI>Glad Newes'</HI>
Why so? Because it is the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> who sees not
here the simple subtelty of this <HI>Deceiver?</HI> The <HI>Gospel</HI>
or <HI>Glad Newes</HI> preached is the power of God unto
Salvation to every one that believeth &amp;c. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.
Therefore this <HI>Glad Newes told, written, printed,
preached,</HI> is not the <HI>Glad Newes:</HI> would he now
perswade himself and us that <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Pro|phets</HI>
that wrote of this <HI>Glad Newes,</HI> and those four
heavenly <HI>Pen-men</HI> (or <HI>Pens</HI>) which by the finger of
God, (his immediate <HI>Spirit</HI>) wrote the History of
the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> of the Lord Jesus, &amp;c. wrote
nothing of the Gospel or glad news, for the glad
news is the power of God.</P>
<P>2. I know the trick of these old Cheaters and
Juglers to hide [193] themselves, and their cheat|ing
in the <HI>Bushes</HI> and <HI>Thickets</HI> of <HI>words</HI> of di|verse
<HI>Significations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The horri|ble Cheat of the Foxians.</NOTE> or figurative Speeches, which all

know it is <HI>Fox</HI> his trick, and all their tricks in his

<HI>Spirit &amp; Gospel &amp; Covenant &amp; Iustification,</HI> (as be|fore
I proved) to be all that one cheating Fancy
called <HI>Light</HI> in them and in every one that cometh
into the World.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Gospel is called the Power of God.</NOTE> These bewitched souls will not
owne a <HI>figurative speech</HI> when it makes not for their

<PB N="294" REF="154">
the wonderfull effect of it to him that believeth
this <HI>Glad Newes,</HI> which few or none believe, as be|ing

calls this <HI>Glad news,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How it is called Pauls Gospel.</NOTE> his <HI>Gospel</HI> or <HI>Glad news,</HI> Rom.
2. Will the <HI>Foxians</HI> therefore say that either <HI>Paul</HI>
lyed, or else it is not Gods Gospel nor Christs, but
<HI>Pauls</HI> although it is most true that as <HI>Paul</HI> had
charge of it (as a <HI>Shepheard</HI> of another mans <HI>Flock,</HI>

common Phrase of Speech (though not <HI>literal</HI> but
<HI>figurative</HI>) be called <HI>Pauls</HI> (or any other Messengers
of <HI>Christ) Glad news</HI> or <HI>Gospel.</HI> 5. There is a wild
beast called a <HI>Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Foxes.</NOTE> a subtle and pernicious creature:
there was a famous heavenly Man, a famous writer
of the Book of <HI>Martyrs, Iohn Fox,</HI> and there is this
poor deluded &amp; deluding Soul <HI>G. Fox,</HI> to whome I
am now replying, ought not these to be <HI>distin|guished?</HI>
Is there not such a mischievous subtle
Beast called the <HI>Fox</HI> because <HI>G. Fox</HI> bears (and that
most justly and by a finger of Gods <HI>providence</HI> bears
it) the <HI>wild Beasts</HI> name: or was not such a <HI>learned

<HI>I. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scrip|ture the word or glad news from Hea|ven written.</NOTE> because <HI>G. Fox</HI> bears that name also? 6.
But further, If the Glad news may not be called
the <HI>Glad news</HI> when tis <HI>Scripture</HI> (that is <HI>written</HI>) or
<HI>preached,</HI> then not <HI>Glad news</HI> when <HI>spoken.</HI> 7. The
Law denounceth Sentence of Death against a Trai|tor
&amp;c. this Sentence is written, &amp; in a Sence may
be called a <HI>Killing Letter:</HI> the King pardons this
<PB N="295" REF="154">
<HI>Traitor,</HI> and this Sentence of <HI>Pardon</HI> is written:
this gracious word of a King is not less his <HI>Word</HI>
because it is <HI>Written</HI> then it was when first spoken
by him; and this word or pleasure of the King
written may be called Gospel or <HI>Glad news,</HI> the
<HI>Glad news</HI> or <HI>Gospel</HI> of his Temporal <HI>Salvation:</HI>
will any sober man say as <HI>G. Fox</HI> impiously and
frantickly, that the writing of the Pardon and
the <HI>Broad-Seal</HI> is a <HI>Dead letter</HI> &amp; a <HI>Killing letter &amp;c.</HI>
because Paper Parchment <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If <HI>G. Fox</HI> from hunt|ing

be stiled a <HI>Dead letter</HI> yea a <HI>Killing letter</HI> though it
contain nothing (as the Christian <HI>Gospel</HI> or <HI>Glad
news</HI> doth not) but <HI>glad news</HI> or <HI>Tidings.</HI> 8. Hence
it is that we read so often of <HI>Preaching the Gospel,</HI>
of <HI>Believing the Gospel,</HI> and that as before <HI>Paul</HI> calls
it his <HI>Glad news,</HI> or <HI>Gospel</HI> because it was his work
to tell it.</P>
<P>Yea but saith this Deceiver throughout his Book
<HI>A man may have the Letter and Form, without the
Power and Life. &amp;c.</HI> I Answer Who knows not
that? and that a <HI>Form &amp; picture</HI> is not the man
himself? who knows not that <HI>Iudas</HI> notwithstand|ing
his pretended Love and <HI>Kissing of Christ Iesus</HI>
that yet he had not the <HI>Life &amp; power</HI> of true <HI>Love</HI>
and <HI>heavenly affection:</HI> but doth it follow that liv|ing
and moving Bodyes have not Souls &amp; Spirits
<PB N="296" REF="155">
within them, because that <HI>pictures</HI> have not? That
none preach <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> truly because that <HI>G. Fox</HI>
preacheth an immaginary and <HI>Allegorical Christ,</HI>
in order to establish himself the only true Christ,
and the <HI>Eternal Son of God</HI> as many bewitched
Souls call him. 9. What is this but to cheat poor
<HI>Birds</HI> with the <HI>Chaff &amp; Falacy</HI> of dividing the
Body from the Soul, the <HI>Letter</HI> from the <HI>Meaning,</HI>
the <HI>Instrument</HI> or <HI>Tool</HI> from the <HI>Workman</HI> or <HI>Hus|bandman</HI>

<P>10. The truth is (search your cheating <HI>Familiars</HI>

<P>I Reply with <HI>Ioseph Kellet,</HI> (and the rest of those

some Ships (against a <HI>Turk or other Enemy</HI>) we re|solve
to kill or be killd, yea and to sink by his side
before we will yield to be taken by him: there|fore
doth the Holy Spirit so often speak of mans
hating of God and Gods hating of him, yea of
mans abhorring of God, and Gods abhorring of
him, and <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. that not only mans wisdome is at
enmity but enmity it self against God. Hence it
is, few <HI>Kings,</HI> few <HI>Counsellours,</HI> few <HI>Nobles,</HI> few

<P>An eighth Instance of <HI>Foxes</HI> poor, lame Answer
is in <HI>Page</HI> 27.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard Baxter</NOTE> where he brings in <HI>Richard Baxter,</HI>
saying <HI>[To say that any is perfect and without sin is
the Devil speaking in man:] G. Fox</HI> Answers, con|trary
to the language of the Apostles and Christ,
who bid them be perfect, and the Apostle spake
Wisdome, among them that be perfect: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aid
they were made free from sin, and it is the Devil
speaking in man that speaks for sin while Men are
upon the Earth, for the Devil holds him up that
makes men not perfect which Truth makes men
free again from the Devil, &amp; speaks in Man, and
says be perfect.</P>
<P>I Reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mat|ters of per|fection</NOTE> <HI>(whether this willingly ignorant Soul knows
or no) I know that the Devil knows that there is a
Fallacie in this word Perfection.</HI> 1. Sometime in
Scripture, it signifies no more then <HI>Sincerity &amp; Up|rightness,</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="158">
(and so is translated) sometimes <HI>Compleat|ness
&amp; Fulness</HI> in its kinde, though but in a small
Vessel; sometimes <HI>Fortified, Strong &amp; Armed;</HI> and
sometimes the <HI>Fulness of the Godhead,</HI> to whose in|comprehensible
<HI>Ocean</HI> not one Drop can be given,
nor one Drop taken from him. In <HI>Mat. 5. Be ye
Perfect,</HI> &amp;c We are not exhorted [198] to be equal
with God in Holiness, for that is to be God our
selves, and being set down in the throne of the God|head,
to thrust the Eternal God out, for there can
be but one in the Throne of the Godhead: But
we are commanded to labour to be like unto God
who not only is kinde to his Friends but his Ene|mies
also: As when we are bid to be like the <HI>Sun</HI>
to shine upon the Bad as well as the Good: will a
sober Soul imagine that we are bid to be as <HI>Pure,</HI>
as <HI>Glorious,</HI> as <HI>Vast,</HI> as <HI>Swift</HI> as the Sun is: but the
Spirit tells us of a Generation <HI>that are pure in their
own eyes, and yet are not cleansed from their filthiness.</HI>
Yea, but saith <HI>Fox, Paul</HI> spake Wisdome amongst
them that were perfect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3. about perfection</NOTE> <HI>Phil</HI> 3. I answer, what if
the <HI>Translators</HI> had turned that word among them
that be strong intelligent, capacious as the word
often, and there signifies, why doth <HI>Paul</HI> also speak|ing
of such a strength or capacity as the Saints may
attain to in this life profess that he was yet (as it
were but clambring up the Hill) this is the vote of
all the highest Saints in Scripture lamenting their
Brethren and<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Erase "Brethren and."</HI> R. W. Ms. Ann.</NOTE> Inabilities, and the Battle between
the old Man and the new: Of which Battle <HI>G. Fox</HI>
and his <HI>Foxians</HI> know not: for Sathan having Pos|session
<PB N="303" REF="158">
all is in peace. It hath been ever known
that all Gods Children are like high and glorious
<HI>Queens &amp; Empresses</HI> who wittingly endure, not as
the Holy Scripture speaks) that such an ugly Fiend
as the Devil should touch them, no not in an evil
thought. 3. They are like <HI>Fields &amp; Gardens</HI> in
which the Husbandman and Gardiner allows not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The estate of Gods Children upon Earth</NOTE>
nor endures not a Weed but with grief and endea|vour
of their extirpation. 4. And this is far from
being Proctors and Advocates for sin (as <HI>G. Fox</HI>
most simply and impudently urgeth) for the known
truth is, that <HI>Fox</HI> and his <HI>Foxians</HI> fall most foolish|ly
and fiercely upon such as profess most holiness,
most sincerity, and most Mortification, most love
to God, and his only begotten the Spirit of Holi|ness,
&amp; the Holy Scriptures or written Will of God.</P>
<P><HI>A ninth Instance is in page 28. where G. Fox.
tells how the same Author preached an external
word</HI> [Which the Scripture speaks not of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard Baxter</NOTE> but of the
word that lives, abides and endures for ever, and of
the Scriptures of Truth that cannot be broken: and of
Gods words and Christs words, and that is not exter|nal:
this is not agreeable to sound words that cannot
be condemned: but that is like his Doctrine that knows
not the Eternal: but the Ministers of Christ did not
tell of an external word, but you being made by the will
of man speaks to the People of an external word.]</P>
<P>I Reply, The word (whether external, internal,
or eternal) is a [199] similitude, for we know God
hath no Mouth, nor Tongue, nor Words as we
have: but as Kings, and Generals of Armies or
Navies, or any Commanders in chief signifie their
<PB N="304" REF="159">
minds by Speech, by Writing, yea by sign (at a dis|tance)
this Word or will, which was before in the
Kings breast, and internal is now outward or ex|ternal.
Hence Christ Jesus above all other wayes
of Gods manifesting himself externally or out|wardly
is called the Word of God, and the Word
which was God. Hence in common speech we
call our Thoughts our selves <HI>[So I think, &amp;c. this is
my Word, my Vote, or Mind.]</HI></P>
<P>And as it is the Field: If a General himself who
first gave the external Word from his own internal
Thoughts:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great consequence of a word</NOTE> if he forget the word in the night a
common Sentinel will make him stand, or fire up|on
him: and shall men be so careful in these tran|sitory
businesses, and shall we suffer open Enemies
to the true Lord Jesus presumptuously to pass with|out
the external word or mind of God, and auda|ciously
to deny such a word at all to be? When
Christ Jesus <HI>Luke</HI> 4 spake out of the <HI>Prophet Isaiah:</HI>
and when <HI>Paul</HI> disputed three Sabbath dayes out of
the Scriptures, and when <HI>Apollos</HI> mightily convinced
the <HI>Iews</HI> from the Scriptures that Jesus was the
Christ, did they not use external, audible Expound|ings
and Applyings of that written word or mind
of God as the external and outward manifestation
of his internal and eternal holy Pleasure.</P>
<P><HI>A tenth Instance is in page</HI> 32.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ellis Bradshaw</NOTE> <HI>where</HI> G. Fox
<HI>brings in</HI> Ellis Bradshaw <HI>saying</HI> [The Quakers Spirit

[That is a Lye: for it teacheth them to have all Men in

<P><PB N="305" REF="159">

and therefore briefly say, 1. That all men may see
how truely they honour and esteem all men in the
Lord, and what Lord and honour it is that they
mean: when G. F. his first word to his Opposite is

<P>Again, tis true in Christ Jesus there is neither
Bond nor Free, Male nor Female, and consequently
no Master no Man, no Father no Child no King

1. Yet first how full is the Holy Scripture of

Wise knows how proudly, and simply, and barba|rously
they have run into uncivil and inhumane
Behaviours towards all their Superiours, the eldest
and highest, how that they have declared by prin|ciple

respected in the World but themselves as being
Gods and Christs. Tis true our <HI>English Bibles</HI> and
<HI>Grammar</HI> (as <HI>Fox</HI> his great Learning often objects)
makes thou to a single person, and Thou in Holy
Scripture is used in a grave and respective way unto
Superiours, unto Kings, and Parents, and God him|self:
But 1. (As I have said) the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and the

be truely turned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thou &amp; Thee</NOTE> 2. Every Nation, every <HI>Shire,</HI>

I have therefore publickly declared my self, that a

they stood here upon <HI>Coals</HI> and were not willing

having been in <HI>N. England</HI> when he wrote that pas|sage;
but since I have heard that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have
commended the spirit of the <HI>Indians,</HI> for they have
seen them come into <HI>English Houses</HI> and sit down
by the fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The In|dians and Quakers of one Spirit.</NOTE> not speaking a word to any body: But
this cariage of the <HI>Indians</HI> proceeds from a <HI>bruitish

any respect in word or gesture to the Gover|nour

<HI>Quakers</HI> general fashion and Spirit)</P>
<P>Further I told them, that in some respect the

that of the <HI>Indians,</HI> for if they were sd by the

they are very ready to receive your <HI>Salutation</HI> kind|ly,
and return you another: But commonly we
know that it is not so with the <HI>Quakers bruitish spi|rit.</HI>
2. The <HI>Indians</HI> morning and evening, and
upon all meetings, they give a respective and
<PB N="310" REF="162">
proper <HI>Salutation</HI> to their own <HI>Superiours,</HI> and some|times
in gesture as well as speech. 3. Although
the <HI>Indians</HI> are <HI>bruits</HI> in their <HI>Nakedness</HI> both men

(except it be in their mad <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> for then
they will be <HI>stark naked</HI>) that as to their <HI>Female
kind,</HI> they will carefully from their birth keep on
some modest covering before them. <HI>W. E.</HI> rose up
and said they did abhor <HI>Uncleaness</HI> as well as our

of long time had been Loving and respecttive to
me, but now they were enraged, so that I said unto
my <HI>Antagonists,</HI> seeing some <HI>Heat</HI> is risen about
these matters, I will if you please go on to the sec|ond
<HI>Branch</HI> of this <HI>14th Position.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers spirit tending to Arbetrary Govern|ment.</NOTE> I told them the
<HI>2d. Branch</HI> was,</P>
<P><HI>That the Spirit of the Quakers tendeth to bring in
an Arbetrary Government.</HI> I said we all knew how
it had cost the blood of <HI>thousands</HI> &amp; <HI>ten Thousands</HI>
this matter of <HI>Goverment &amp; Lawes:</HI> that the Most
High &amp; only Wise choosing one <HI>People</HI> and <HI>Nation
of Israel</HI> to be his own, he wrote them Laws (some
with his own inconceivable <HI>finger</HI> written) and some
by <HI>Moses</HI> his inspired <HI>Pen-man,</HI> it pleased him not
<PB N="312" REF="163">
to leave their <HI>Wisest</HI> and <HI>Holyest Kings &amp; Gover|nours</HI>
without written known Lawes, with <HI>Rewards</HI>
and <HI>Penaltyes</HI> annexed. But I argued if that were
true that all the <HI>Quakers</HI> were guided in all they
said and did by the immediate Spirit of God (as I
proved <HI>Fox</HI> maintained) then if they obtain higher
or lower Governours of their Spirits, Surely it
shines cleer that there is no need of Laws for them
to rule &amp; act by,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers have no need of Scripture much less of the written Laws of men</NOTE> for they had no need of Scrip|ture,
and seing the <HI>Immediate Inspirations</HI> of God
would not suffer them to erre in Judgment, for as
they said of the holy Scripture, they had no need
of it, for they had the holy Scripture within them,
their Teacher within them, and all that they spake
was Scripture, and the voice of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So I said
much more [204] might it be said of Mens <HI>Laws &amp;
Writings;</HI> that surely they had no need of them: for
what could be more just and equal, more pure &amp;
holy in all Cases Controversies &amp; Businesses, then
the immediate <HI>Voice of God? W. E.</HI> said, what dost
thou fill peoples ears with strange <HI>Notions,</HI> as if the

and would bring all Government and all Laws to
nothing? We are for righteous <HI>Goverment,</HI> and
righteous <HI>Lawes,</HI> we are not for any to rule by

<P>I Replyed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers &amp; none else in the World fit for Gonrn|ment as they judge</NOTE> that he mistook me, by an <HI>Arbetrary

from <HI>Arbitrium</HI> which signified <HI>Will</HI> or pleasure:

rose up, and carried a Book (which they said was

counsel had been between <HI>W. Har.</HI> and themselves:

how easily the malicious Spirit of <HI>W. Edm.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">W Harris his charac|ter and practise</NOTE> <HI>&amp; W.

in his outragious practises against <HI>Town, &amp; Colony &amp;
Country.</HI> He was a Pretender in <HI>Old England,</HI> but
in <HI>New</HI> my experience hath told me, that he can
be one with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yea <HI>Iesuits</HI> or <HI>Mahume|tans</HI>
for his own worldly ends and advantage. He
is long known to have put <HI>Scorns &amp; Ieers</HI> upon the
eminent Inhabitants of Town and Country. He
hath been notorious for quarrelling, and challeng|ing,
and fighting, even when he pretended with
the <HI>Quakers</HI> against <HI>Carnal Weapons;</HI> so that there
stands upon Record in the Town-book of <HI>Provi|dence</HI>
an Act of <HI>Disfranchisement</HI> upon him, for fight|ing
and shedding Blood in the street,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W H &amp; the Q the higher powers as they simply affirm</NOTE> and for main|taining

the <HI>Higher Powers</HI> (as now the <HI>Quakers do</HI>) and in

the <HI>Massachusets</HI>) and to cry out <HI>no Lords,</HI> no <HI>Mas|ters,</HI>
<PB N="317" REF="165">
as is yet to be seen in his Writing: this cost
my self and the Colony much trouble. Then (as
the Wind favoured his ends) no man more cries up
Magistrates: then not finding that pretence, nor
the People called <HI>Baptists</HI> (in whom he confided)
serving his ends. He flies to <HI>Connecticut Colony</HI> (then
and still in great Contest with us) in hopes to attain
his gaping about Land from them, if they prevail
over us: to this end he in publick Speech and
Writing applauds <HI>Connecticut Charter</HI> and damns
ours, and his Royal Majesties favour also for grant|ing
us favour (as to our Consciences) which he
largely endeavours by writing to prove the <HI>K. Ma|jesty</HI>

gets loose, and leaves open a door for any man to
challenge the Kings Majesty for being too Godly or

<P>I had thought to have declared thus much pub|lickly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W Edm. his igno|rant and impudent zeal and upbraid|ings</NOTE>

my <HI>Lord Edmundson</HI> grew hot, and told me that I

had charged the People of the Lord with many
great and grievous Charges, which he said I could
not prove, yea, he said he would speak it before
the Lord, I had not proved one of them, and there|fore
he warned me, being an old Man, that I
should not carry such a <HI>Burden</HI> on my back to my

he heard I had been a Magistrate, and said I was a
fit man to be a Magistrate that would so wrong|fully

<P><PB N="323" REF="168">
_I Have chosen out the short Assertions of <HI>G.
Fox</HI> his <HI>Opposites</HI> as he quotes them, and
his short Answer for brevity sake, &amp;c.</P>
<P>1. The first of this Addition I name,
is in <HI>pag.</HI> 6. of <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Folio Book, where he
brings in <HI>Samuel Eaton</HI> saying [The <HI>Apostle</HI> faying
to the Saints, <HI>You know all things,</HI> it is [2] an exces|sive

would make him a <HI>Lyar,</HI> the <HI>Minister</HI> of God: so
he is in the false spirit gone out into the World,
contrary to 1. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2. Who know all things]</P>
<P>I Reply, 1. I cannot learn that they litterally
hold, that they know all things knowable as God
(though G. <HI>Fox</HI> writes that they know all things as
God (yet I can not think them so gross as to imagine
that they know all things, past&punc; present, and to
come, (as the Devil pretends he doth, and offers
to reveal so much to some Conjurers) but I judge
they must come to some figurative meaning, as
their opposite writeth.</P>
<P>For 2. What hinders (as before) but if the <HI>Qua|kers</HI>
be <HI>Omniscient,</HI> and know all things, but they
should be also <HI>Omnipotent</HI> and do all things, for so
<HI>Paul</HI> writes, <HI>Phil. 4. I can do all things:</HI> I know
they say, they are one with God and Christ, and
they know all things, and can do all things; and
yet this sense which litterally is so Proud and Blas|phemous,
must be made out by a meaning and by
a figure (which they cry out against in others.)</P>
<P>3. Therefore doth not the Spirit of God in <HI>Prov.</HI>
28.<NOTE PLACE="marg">About knowing all things.</NOTE> open this to us, saying, <HI>Evil men understand not
Iudgement, but they that seek the Lord understand all
<PB N="324" REF="169">
things:</HI> that is, God answers their Prayers, and ina|bles
them to know and do, all that he calls them
to, when the <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>scornful</HI> are rejected.</P>
<P>4. Therefore I believe it is that the most Holy
and most just and wise Lord leaves these poor proud
and scornful Souls to seek <HI>wisdome</HI> and not to find
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers proud of knowl|edge yet knowing nothing.</NOTE> to be ignorant, <HI>knowing nothing,</HI> (as <HI>Gods Spirit</HI>

<HI>practices immodest, irrational, and more then savage,</HI> as
I have proved against them.</P>

with mankind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two great Bar|gains of God with mankind.</NOTE> 1. that of Justice and due

Infinitely easier and <HI>sweeter Bargain</HI> upon the Terms

<P><PB N="332" REF="173">
3. It is one thing for God to offer this Covenant
or <HI>Bargain,</HI> [wherever the sound of this Gospel or

and receive it as all the Elect of God do, and
another thing to work <HI>freely</HI> and give <HI>freely</HI> the

working</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> and belief in the hearts

<P>4. It is Common with the <HI>holy Spirit</HI> to speak
<HI>Figuratively</HI> in the <HI>holy Scripture.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scripture language</NOTE> To call the Sign

it self. The King pardons Rebels for his Sons sake,
his Son may in a Sense be said [8] [though not <HI>liter|ally]</HI>

between two Chapmen that are absent and distant
drives on a <HI>marriage</HI> between a Man and a Woman
absent each from other, and may in a Figurative Sense
be called the <HI>Bargain</HI> or <HI>Covenant,</HI> and yet not <HI>literally</HI>
and <HI>properly</HI> as the poor <HI>Quakers</HI> would their <HI>Christ</HI>
to be.</P>
<P>5 The grace and mercy of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God of|fers the Gospel divers wayes</NOTE> the Gospel or

speak, and of [11] the burning up of the
Whore and of all Christs Enemies and Antichrists.</P>
<P>8. Of the never-ending Joyes of the Righteous
after this life, and the everlasting Worm and Fire
of the ungodly, which shall never dye nor be
quenched until the Eternal Power and Godhead
(revealed in the Holy Scriptures) come to a Period
and Dissolution.</P>

<P><HI>The third Branch of G.</HI> Fox <HI>his Answer is,</HI> [Men

but now it is written, it is but <HI>pen, ink</HI> and <HI>paper,</HI> it
is but a dead Letter, it is not Gods word, God hath
but One <HI>Word, Christ.</HI> The Scripture is his <HI>Words,</HI>
&amp;c. Oh the <HI>audacious brockishness</HI> of the <HI>foul Spirit</HI>
in these wild <HI>Foxians:</HI> They dare not (though what
dares not their <HI>hellish Spirit</HI> against the K. of Hea|ven

so heavenly of him:</HI></P>
<P>8. Instance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 25. Joseph Kellet &amp;c.</NOTE> In the 25. <HI>pag. G. Fox</HI> brings in
the same Author, saying, [that the Power which
justles out the Form is an Error:] He Answ. which
was the Apostles work to bring of the Form into
the Power, the substance Christ which was not an
Error, but you bring in the Error, keep people in
the Form out of the Power, and not in the Apos|tles
work:]</P>
<P><HI>I Reply: G.</HI> Fox <HI>is in his</HI> Burrough <HI>of the vari|ous
Sense of the word Form:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The word Form de|bated</NOTE> <HI>It hath respect to</HI>
Nature, <HI>to</HI> Art, <HI>to</HI> Civil, Natural, <HI>and</HI> Divine mat|ters:
<HI>Shall I now (like a Fool and a mad man)
Cry down all</HI> Natural, Civil <HI>and</HI> Divine Beings?
<HI>Are not all the</HI> internal <HI>and</HI> external Forms, <HI>shapes,
or Beings of the Creatures in</HI> Heaven, Earth, <HI>and</HI>
Sea, <HI>of</HI> Angels, Sun, Moon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Men, Birds, Beasts,
Fishes,, <HI>admirably glorious and</HI> stupendious? <HI>G.</HI> Fox
<HI>runs to the Picture, or Forms of these Forms, and
saith childishly, that the Form or picture without
the Life is nothing: who knows not that, that as to
Life it is good as nothing.</HI></P>
<P>1. But to come to worship, was there not a Form,
<PB N="340" REF="177">
or manner of <HI>Circumsion,</HI> the <HI>Passover,</HI> the <HI>Taber|nacle,</HI>
the <HI>Temple,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>2. Did ever the Servants of God when they in|veighed
against the <HI>Customariness,</HI> the Carelessness,
the pictures, and the meer [13] Formality of the
Worshippers (Jews or Christians) inveigh against
the worship it self, and the Appointments of God
and of his Son Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>3. Did the Servants of God ever labour to bring
and hale off Gods people from the worship it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods Or|diances and Institu|tions</NOTE> but
only from the dead and meerly formal using of them,
until the time appointed by God himself for their
withdrawings, disappearing and abrogation. What
a shameless falshood is it that any of Gods Messen|gers
brought Gods people off from those <HI>heavenly
Fabricks</HI> which God erected by their Ministry or
Service all the World over?</P>
<P>4. <HI>May not</HI> Gods Messengers <HI>now Cry out against
the</HI> apish Imitations <HI>&amp;</HI> Formalities <HI>of the</HI> Papists <HI>(so
horribly and bloodily) abusing</HI> Prayer, preaching,
Baptisme, <HI>the</HI> Lords Supper, Excommunication, <HI>&amp;c.
but (like the</HI> Assyrians <HI>or</HI> Babilonians, <HI>Psal. 74. All
these</HI> Christian Appointments <HI>must be broken and
tumbled down with</HI> Axes <HI>and</HI> Hammers. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>5. This is Treason and Rebellion in any Athe|ists
or whomsoever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers gross Hypocri|sie</NOTE> but more abominable Hipo|critical
in these <HI>Pharisaical Foxians,</HI> who Cry out
against the <HI>apish Imitators,</HI> and yet themselves prac|tice,
<HI>preaching, praying, Congregations,</HI> or <HI>Churches,
singings, Conventings,</HI> and (implicite though real) Ad|dings
to <HI>Castings out,</HI> &amp;c Full well (as the Lord
<PB N="341" REF="177">
<HI>Iesus</HI> speaks) abrogating the word and Appoint|ments
of God, that they may set up and establish
their own Traditions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>6. Tis true, the Protestants have made separation
from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as <HI>whorish</HI> and <HI>Bloody:</HI>
in order to the Return to the first Primitive purity,
from which the whore of <HI>Rome</HI> hath departed.</P>
<P>7. G. <HI>Fox</HI> Cries out against all Scripture and
Common Sense, against all Forms, that is, wayes and
manners of Gods Worship: Cries up a Christ with|in,
<HI>Scripture within, Church within, Ministers within,
Baptisme and Supper within,</HI> yet practice they most
of these [so many as their Idol requires] and will
serve his turn) as outwardly and visibly as any in
the world.</P>
<P>8. I know it is the observation of one of G. <HI>Fox</HI>
his Opposites [a man of excellent knowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A passage of Mr. Baxters weighed</NOTE> piety
&amp; industry, M <HI>Baxter] viz.</HI> that the Churches of
the <HI>Independents,</HI> &amp; <HI>Baptists</HI> have been the source
and Spring whence have flown the Generation of
the Quakers. For my self I have observed the
contrary in these parts, [14] and that [although some
rotten Professors, or weak Souls though true] have
been bewitched by those Soul-witches yet generally
[where they have any Liberty] the <HI>National Church</HI>
fills up their nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the Qua|kers Pros|elites do arife.</NOTE> My Reason I gave them
in publick, when W. <HI>Edm. Boasted</HI> of their Num|bers,
<HI>viz.</HI> their Religion is so easie, never coming
near the <HI>Roots</HI> of <HI>rotten Nature,</HI> but so wonderfully
agreeing with it, and changing one Devil for
another, as I have before instanced, so that I told them
I adored the <HI>Infinite Power, wisdome</HI> and <HI>goodness</HI> of
<PB N="342" REF="178">
<HI>God,</HI> that they were not <HI>ten thousand</HI> fold more, and
I say Millions more, then they are: For, I can de|monstrate
that if G: <HI>Fox</HI> (for all their <HI>hypocritical
prating</HI> against <HI>Carnal Weapons</HI>) get a Sword (as
<HI>Mahomet</HI> did) most of the Popish, and Protestant
and pagan World, will easily be brought to dance
after him.</P>
<P>9. As to the point of Separation: I pray Mr.
<HI>Baxter</HI> and others of G. <HI>Foxes</HI> learned and godly
opposites who are yet (in their Judgement and
Conscience perswaded to the <HI>National Worships]</HI>
to hear me patiently four words.</P>
<P>1. I pray them to remember what the word
<HI>Nazarite</HI> is in <HI>English.</HI> The word <HI>Nazareth</HI> and the
word <HI>[Iesus of Nazareth]</HI> and in plain English.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Add "y^e saviour of y^e separate."<HI>R. W. Ms. Ann.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>2. Was there ever Child of God in this world
but he was a <HI>Nazarate, separate</HI> from worldly per|sons,
worldly practice and worldly worships, as he
comes to see them, <HI>&amp;c. and endureth not that the evil
one should touch him?</HI></P>
<P>3. Is not <HI>Gods</HI> name <HI>Iealous</HI> in this end of the
World, not the west-world, as well as since he first
proclaimed it in the East.</P>
<P>4. Hath not his Jealousie raged against the <HI>Iew|ish
whoremongers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Considera|tion touch|ing sepa|rate Churches</NOTE> who defiled his <HI>first Bed,</HI> and will
he wink at the <HI>Christian Adulterers</HI> and <HI>Adulteresses</HI>
either in Worship or Conversation?</P>
<P>5. With what good Conscience can I (a national
Protestant) <HI>separate</HI> from my <HI>Father</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> and
my <HI>mother</HI> the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> and my Brethren
and Sisters the <HI>Papists,</HI> and yet it must not be
<PB N="343" REF="178">
<HI>Christian</HI> for other Souls to see further degrees of
that <HI>Separation</HI> necessary, and I must bring up the
foot of every mans Light, and <HI>Sight,</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI>
to my <HI>Laste.</HI></P>
<P>6. This is the main ground of my Controversy
with the proud Quakers, they stir up in their Illu|minations
in themselves, and [15] Condemnations
against others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers Con|verts</NOTE> but they magnify (with the <HI>Papists</HI>
and <HI>Arminians</HI>) Cursed, rotten Nature: their <HI>Con|verts</HI>
and <HI>Proselites</HI> have but a painted, formal Re|pentance,
Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Only if they can come to
their Church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Thou and thee, and disres|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ct
all Superiours then are they high Saints, can|not
Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>7. This (as before I hinted) was the heavenly
Principle of those many precious and gallant <HI>Wor|thies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N. E. glo|ry the very top bough of it</NOTE>
the <HI>Leaders</HI> and <HI>Corner Stones</HI> of these <HI>New-England
Colonies,</HI> viz. they desired to worship God
in purity according to those perswasions in their
Consciences, which they believed God had lighted
up.</P>
<P>8. They desired such for their <HI>Fellow Worshippers</HI>
as they (upon a Christian account) could have evi|dence
that to be true and real <HI>Worshippers</HI> of God
in <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> also.</P>
<P>But I forget this is but an Appendix, and there|fore
I return to another Instance of G. <HI>Fox</HI> his
poor. and lame, and naked Answers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A 9th. Instance, is</HI> pag. 32. <HI>where G.</HI> Fox <HI>brings
in</HI> Ellis Bradshaw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ellis Brad|shaw</NOTE> <HI>saying,</HI> [The Spirit of God doth
not teach to judge before the time] <HI>and he adds that
others of them say</HI> [The Saints shall not Iudge while
<PB N="344" REF="179">
they be upon the Earth.] <HI>To which he Answers,</HI>
[But the Spirit did teach the Apostle to judge, and his
Time was come; <HI>And he tells some</HI> that they were of
old ordained for Condemnation, <HI>and</HI> their Damnation
slumbred not, <HI>and they went on to Eternal Judge|ment,</HI>
and it is high Time not to judge.]</P>
<P>I Reply, Some of this his Answer, is some of his
wonted <HI>Nonsence,</HI> or the Printers oversight, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
But to the point the great Jugler hath taught G.
<HI>Fox</HI> and his <HI>Foxians</HI> a trick to outface <HI>Death</HI> and
<HI>Indgement.</HI> They now keep the great Sessions and
call all the world to their <HI>Bar</HI> and Judgement.
Thus did the poor cheated Souls in <HI>London</HI> lately
<HI>Reeves</HI> and <HI>Mugleton</HI> thunder out their eternal Sen|tence
of Damnation upon the Souls and bodies of
their <HI>Oppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The two pretended last wit|nesses Reves and Muggle|ton</NOTE> &amp; that with such Seriousness, Confi|dence
&amp; Majesty, that I have known sollid Christ|ians
put into a fright by them.</P>
<P>It is true there is a lawful judging not according
to rashness or pride (as the Quakers is) but accord|ing
to righteous Judgement.</P>
<P>It is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jugling of the Qua|kers to make themselves eternal Judgs</NOTE> <HI>the spiritual man judgeth and discerneth
all things,</HI> that is, looks into the Causes and Natures
of things, Times and persons: But what is this to

I know the <HI>Foxians</HI> would turn this Scripture, and
that <HI>golden Chain,</HI> Heb. 6. the first <HI>Christian Princi|ples</HI>
and the Eternal Judgement into <HI>Mysteries,</HI> and
that they now Judge the Secrets of Men, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.
by <HI>Pauls Gospel:</HI> (therefore by looking on a man
they can discern the inward parts, and what each

<PB N="345" REF="179">
and <HI>Iude</HI> in <HI>ten thousands of his Saints, and now is the
Day appointed in which God judgeth the World by that
man Christ Iesus</HI> [which man they are] of which
the word of God hath approved, in that they are
raised from the Dead in Souls and Bodies to keep
the <HI>Eternal Iudgement:</HI> This Mystery many of their
young Scholars and many that are truely fearing
God amongst them will not believe. But they
spare not to owne their <HI>high Court</HI> of <HI>Iustice</HI> [when
they were put to it] by Speech and writing, and
were it not for some obstacles (especially two) this
were a fine Colour for their Courts, like a Com|pany
of drunken Sots that kept a Court in <HI>Hart|ford-Shire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A danger|ous coun|terfeit Court.</NOTE> and feigned themselves Judges, and Jus|tices,
and Officers, &amp; had almost brought themselves
all to the Gallows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by hanging up one man un|til
he began to look black, and some of them be|gan
to fear their own Necks, and to repent of their
rash madness.</P>
<P>The first Obstacle against this their pretended
high Court of Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two great Bars to the Quakers high Court of eternal Judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> is their own Confession, <HI>viz.
Christ Iesus was real a Man as any of us, and so con|tinues,</HI>
except they can give an account of what is
become of him, which at <HI>Newport</HI> they could not do.</P>
<P>The second is, their own Spirit and Practises,
which I have proved to be so far from <HI>Iude</HI> and
<HI>Enochs</HI> 10000 Saints, that their Pride and Scornful|ness,
their Rash, Revilings and Railings, their Rash
Cursings and Judgings, their Superstitious and New
Inventions, their Blasphemies and Hypocrisies, their
Inhumanities and Impudencies, such as render them
so far from being the high Saints and Judges of the
<PB N="346" REF="180">
World, that they fall under the Judgement of all
sober end modest persons.</P>
<P>The 10. Iustance, is in <HI>pag.</HI> 38. where he brings
in <HI>Tho. Collier,</HI> saying, <HI>[All that hath been, are, or
shall be Converted since the Gospel Ministration are
Converted by the Apostles words]</HI> He Answers:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 38. T. Collier</NOTE> So
he hath thrown out the Spirit which doth regene|rate,
and Christ the way to the Father, the Word

come to him that they might be converted, so if
they get all the Apostles Words and come not to
Christ they are not Converted, and none are Con|verted
by the Apostles Words, but who comes to
the Life that the Words come from.</P>
<P><HI>I reply, and ask G.</HI> Fox <HI>what colour of Truth or
Modesty is in his Inference,</HI> viz. That if God please
to appoint the Words his first Apostles used, to be still
the means of Conversion to he end of the World, that
then he hath thrown out himself, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>For 1. Is not this Gods Covenant with Christ

be in their Mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hs to all Generations: wo be then
to these wild frantick <HI>Inserences</HI> which disjoyn and
separate what the most powerful, most wise and
holy hath joyned together.</P>
<P>2. For, may there not be as before many Agents
Imployed by one glorious Efficient:<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Fox his throw|ing God overboard and his own Rea|son and Sense also.</NOTE> as in <HI>Moses</HI>
building the Tabernacle, <HI>Solomon</HI> the Temple:
Kings in their <HI>Royal Navies</HI> and <HI>Armies, Fights</HI> and
<HI>Battels;</HI> is <HI>Moses</HI> here thrown out, <HI>Solomon</HI> thrown
out, and <HI>Kings</HI> thrown out &amp;c? when <HI>Abraham</HI> sent
<PB N="347" REF="180">
his Servants or <HI>Kings</HI> their Embassadours to Espouse
Brides to their Sons and Heirs, must <HI>Abraham</HI> and

rather this mad Soul throw out <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI>

<HI>first Causes,</HI> yea, and his own <HI>Brains</HI> (in a mad,
proud Frolick) all overboard together?</P>
<P>3. For, doth not <HI>Paul</HI> tell the <HI>Corinthians, that
they were Gods Husbandry and Gods Buildings;</HI> in|ferring
that under God (not throwing him out) he
was a prime Husbandman, yea, (as himself saith
further) a Master Builder; yea, doth not <HI>Paul</HI> tell the
same <HI>Corinthians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Har|mony be|tween God and his Mes|sengers.</NOTE> that they were the Messengers,

Hence <HI>Paul</HI> Preaching, the Lord opened the Heart

the heart of the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> and <HI>Panl so speaking,</HI>

both of <HI>Iews and Greeks</HI> believed.</P>
<P>4. It is true that without God and Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God doth all, yet his meanes must be used by which he is pleased to work.</NOTE> <HI>Pauls
Planting,</HI> and <HI>Apollos Watering</HI> is nothing, who de|nies
this? but therefore shall not <HI>Paul Plant</HI> and
<HI>Apollo Water,</HI> though much in vain, as it was with
the Lord Jesus, his own heavenly Preaching and
amazing Miracles.</P>
<P>18] 5. Do these <HI>Foxians</HI> themselves throw out
God and Christ when (as they say) they use the
Apostles words, to gather Stones, and build up the
Church of God; do they not say as much for their
new fresh <HI>Foxian</HI> as ever was spoken of the Apos|tles,
<PB N="348" REF="181">
or any pretending to succeed them? I could
give many Instances.</P>
<P>6. There have been many Conversions to the
Christian Name in these parts of the World called
<HI>Christendome.</HI></P>
<P>These the Papists brag to have effected in all the
four parts of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa|pists brag of their Conver|sions.</NOTE> both in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies,
Asia</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> as also in <HI>Africa</HI> and especi|ally
in <HI>Europe,</HI> where thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Man of sin chiefly
resideth: these Conversions have been wrought
sometimes in parts and by degrees, and sometimes
of the whole Nations, and this sometimes by the
Sword, sometimes by the Marriages of Princes, all
which are easily effected; because (as in <HI>the Sheche|mites</HI>
and <HI>Samaritains</HI> case) whose Peoples, Nations,
Tongues and Multitudes will easily turn to the
Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns; and that
very formidable Beast also for Fear, and Gain, and
Hope, &amp;c. will easily suffer the Whore of <HI>Rome</HI> to
ride him.</P>
<P>7. From these Peoples, Tongues, and Nations,
&amp;c. it hath pleased the most Holy and only Wise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|testant Conver|sions</NOTE>

<P>8. The Father of Spirits hath stirred up some
Witnesses in all Protestant Nations, to preach against
a Formal, National or Parochial Conversion, to
<PB N="349" REF="181">

purity of Churches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These the Jesuits
call Puritans, and Confess that they only among the
Protestants, (as themselves among the Papists) are
fit to be thought on as to pretence of the Christian
Name and Religion.</P>
<P>9. At the coming of the Lord Jesus there were
two great Com- [19] petitours for preaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two great Corrivals in Christs time.</NOTE> <HI>First,</HI>
the <HI>Pharisees</HI> who by Laud and Sea sent abroad
their <HI>Emissaries</HI> to make Converts to the God of

Apostles or Messengers of Christ Jesus sent abroad
with the glad news of a new Bargain or Covenant
of God with the Sons of men, <HI>viz.</HI> this second
sort; It pleased the God of Heaven [not to be
thrown out as this <HI>Fox</HI> frantickly barks] but to go
out wonderfully miraculously, yea, also with the
private labours and preachings of private Christians
scattered by Persecution, as the holy Scripture

<P>A 11. <HI>Instance,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I. Deacon.</NOTE> is in <HI>Pag.</HI> 40. where G. <HI>Fox</HI> brings
in <HI>I. Deacon,</HI> saying <HI>[The enjoyment of Immortulity

<P>He Answers, [Contrary to the Apostles Doctrine,
who saith, <HI>Immortality was brought to light through
the Gospel:</HI> this was when they were upon the
Earth, and the Word of God was in them which
was Immortal.]</P>
<P>1. I Reply First, G. <HI>Fox</HI> affirms an Immortality
(that is a not dying of the Soul and Body) As for
the Soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers dream about not dying or Immor|tality.</NOTE> all true Protestants affirm that the Soul

more than Christ Jesus, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. as for the Body
Papists and Protestants, and the Quakers and all the
World grants, that <HI>all Flesh is as grass,</HI> &amp;c. and the

Sentence of Death, by sickness, Age or Casualty is

or Protestants questions the Immortality of it:
and of the Body also, in joy or Sorrow to Eternity.</P>
<P>As for the Body the Quakers say when the Soul
is gone into God, yea, the Soul of <HI>Iudas</HI> as well as
the Soul of <HI>Peter</HI> as some of them say, and all of
them by Argument will be forced to say, the Body
returns to Earth and Rottenness, never more to be
raised, and no more then Bodies of the Beasts,
Birds and Fishes, (though we know who holds the
Bodies of Beasts, Birds and Fishes shall live again
as the Soul mortalists do) what is it then [21] that
G. <HI>Fox</HI> sputters out for Immortality, or a not dying
in this Life? If he speak of the Soul who denies
it? If of the Body he speaks a Beastly Contradic|tion
to the doleful Sense of all mankind, and their
own also, who die and rot as well as them.</P>
<P>2. It is true, 1 <HI>Tim. 6. God only hath Immortality
dwelling in the Light which no man can approach unto,</HI>
what ever these <HI>Foxians</HI> bruitishly fancy of no dis|tinction
between God and themselves their Light
and his.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Doc|trine of Immortal|ity.</NOTE>
It is true, yet also that <HI>Iesus Christ, 2 Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
1. hath brought Life and Immortality to Light
through the Gospel.</HI> But what is this but the joyful
Condition of the Souls &amp; Bodies of the godly?
their Souls and Bodies raised up with Jesus to a
Spiritual holy Life in this World, their Souls going
to Jesus, and their Bodies <HI>sleeping in Iesus,</HI> and the
rising of their Bodies and uniting to their Spirits
in a Life Eternal?</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="183">
3. As to this <HI>Immortality</HI> of G. <HI>Fox:</HI> all that can
be known of his mind is old H. <HI>Nichols</HI> and the <HI>Ni|colaitans</HI>
mad fictions and fancies of their becoming

but as for <HI>Absolom</HI> himself the Polititians, the sub|tle

Immortality before the Grave they will meet
with a dreadful Mortality, or death of Soul and

<P>3. The Question then follows: If this Light of

<P>Thus the God of Heaven most holy and only

it is, that if ancient Records and Deeds with Hands

<P>I Reply, First, What is the Light of Nature, but
the Light in which every man comes into the
World with (as the <HI>Foxians</HI> speak) a Light differing
from that Light which Beasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The light of Nature discussed</NOTE> wilde and tame, and

<P>2. What is the Light of Nature in Man, but
that Order which the most Glorious Former of all
things hath set (like Wheeles in Clocks or Watches)
a going in all his Creatures?</P>
<P>Some have observed that in the Insensible Crea|tures
to which the most High hath only giving
Beings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Male and Female</NOTE> that there may be observed a Male and
Female amongst them.</P>
<P>This is more observable in Vegetables or grow|ing
Creatures, as in Plants, Trees, Herbs, Flow|ers,
&amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="187">
More yet in Sensitives, as Birds, Beasts, Fishes.</P>
<P>Most of all in Rationals: Men and Women,
whom the most High hath so wonderfully dis|tinguished.</P>
<P>It is true, that in Religious and Christian Mat|ters,
there is no [26] respect of persons with God,
as of Man before the Woman: otherwise than to
order Natural and Civil.</P>
<P>The Woman is Predestinated, is Called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men and Women compared</NOTE> is Justi|fied,
is Glorified, and wears that Golden Chain as
well as the Wisest and Strongest of Mankinde.</P>
<P>And it is true, the Wisdome of God perfers some
Women before thousands of Men, in their being
born of Nobles, in excellent parts (as is observable
in the Lady <HI>Iane,</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> &amp;c.) in some
special favour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kind|ness of God to women</NOTE> as Christ Jesus first appearing to
<HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> and other Women, and sending
them to carry the first Tydings or Gospel of his
Resurrection to his Apostles: yea, in effusions or
powrings forth of an extraordinary measure of his
Spirit before Christs coming, as on <HI>Miriam, Debo|rah,
Anna, Huldah,</HI> &amp;c. and at his coming (accord|ing
to <HI>Ioels</HI> Prophesie) on his Daughters as well as
his Sons (so that as my opposites alledged to me in
publick: <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>Evangelist</HI> had four Daughters
thus extraordinarily end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">wed) yet this favour of
God toward Women destroys not the order which
the God of Order or Nature hath set in those
Bounds, and Limits, and Distinctions between the
Male and Female, the Man and Woman: though
the Holy Scripture were silent, yet Reason and Ex|perience
tell us, that the Woman is the weaker
<PB N="361" REF="187">
Vessel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Womens unfitness for manly employ|ments</NOTE> that she is more fitted to keep and order the
House and Children, &amp;c. that the Lord hath given
a covering of longer Hair to Women as a sign or
teacher of covering Modesty and Bashfulness, Si|lence
and Retiredness: and therefore not so fitted
for Manly Actions and Employments.</P>
<P>Therefore because of <HI>Ioels</HI> Prophesie, or because
we must not limit or quench the Spirit, as G. <HI>Fox</HI>
saith, there is no ground in Gods ordinary course
of Nature to permit Women to pretend to be
Apostles or Messengers to the Nation, or Preach|ers
and Teachers in the Publick Assemblies.</P>
<P>1. Because we finde no such Commission given
by Christ Jesus or any such Practice amongst the
first Believers.</P>
<P>2. The Lord hath set (as Seamen speak) a pre|venter
to such an unnatural boldness by express
Prohibitions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And for being Preachers and pos|tles especi|ally.</NOTE> with the Reasons and Grounds to the
<HI>Corinthians</HI> and to <HI>Timothy:</HI> and to answer those
Scriptures with a flam, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Eve</HI> the Trans|gressor,

<P>4. That Reason the Spirit gives to the <HI>Corinthi|ans,</HI>
for the vailing of Women in publick Assem|blies,
<PB N="362" REF="188">
makes much more for their vailing and silence
in matters of <HI>Prophesying, Preaching</HI> and <HI>Praying,</HI>
viz. Because of the Angels: I know not any fair

attending on and guarding the Assemblies of true

the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and though these Women animated the
Seamen to fight, and Prophesied <HI>that not an hair of

<P>I Reply, In former years I have Conversed
with all the <HI>Indians</HI> of this <HI>New-England</HI> by Land
and Seas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The knowledge of God by nature</NOTE> and I have read the 1. of the <HI>Romans</HI>
often, and now once again at G: <HI>Fox</HI> his motion,
and I find that First, there is generally in all man|kind
in the World a Conviction of an <HI>Invisible,
Omnipotent, and Eternal Power and Godhead.</HI></P>
<P>2. That this Conviction doth arise from the Crea|tion,
(though some of the wisest of the World as
<PB N="364" REF="189">
<HI>Aristotle,</HI> &amp;c. though Confessing a Godhead yet)
hold the world an Eternal Deity it self, and never
to have been created.</P>
<P>3. I find not that ever any man or men (by all
their natural Light or wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con|victions of nature which the 4 Quakers so foolish|ly talk of</NOTE> or Christ within,) could
find out how the World or himself, Man or Wo|man
were created: Though <HI>Iames Nailour</HI> told us
in print, that if never a Letter of Script<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re had
been written, yet their Spirit could tell them all
things.</P>
<P>4. I find all men confess, that the will or Word,
or mind of God is pure, and as they could come to
know, it is to be adored, kept, and observed: and
that it was ever, and is wickedness to Sin against it.</P>
<P>5. All mankind having the Law or without it
are perswaded that some actions are naught, and
against Gods will, as to steal, to Murther, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>6. None (for all the Light and Spirit in every
one) could ever find out how Sin how Sorrow and
Death came into the World: Nor how such Incli|nations
and Dispositions to Sin came into them|selves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>7. I find in all mankind a Conviction that God
is just and [29] powerful, and doth bring plagues
and punishments upon persons, and Nations for
those gross Sins of Adultery, Murther, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>8. I could never lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n (for all that Christ in every
man <HI>Fox</HI> sings of) that ever any man living,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The loss of all men as to God &amp; hraven|ly things</NOTE> or all

things, but as revealed by God, by <HI>extraordinary

his <HI>holy Records,</HI> and the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of them opened,
<PB N="365" REF="189">
<HI>preached,</HI> &amp;c. 1. How to pacifie Gods Justice? 2.
How to resist the <HI>Devils Tyranny:</HI> 3. How to wor|ship
God? 4. How to get <HI>true Blessedness</HI> here, and
in the World to come?</P>
<P>9. Hence (according to <HI>Foxes Opposite</HI>) all man|kind
have invented so many false Gods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men natu|rally frame a God as the Devils do but cannot love him.</NOTE> false worships,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all the world over, yet out of no more Love to
God then the Lamb bears to a Lyon: but out of
Fear, as the old saying is, <HI>primos in Orbe Deos,</HI> &amp;c.
Fear made the first Gods. Hence the <HI>Philistins</HI>
sends the God of <HI>Israel</HI> a present and offering with
Ark or Chest: Hence the <HI>Samaritans</HI> (with the
<HI>Sechemites</HI>) for fear of Lyons or hope of gain will
be of any worship or Religion, as most this day in
the world will be, yea, all and every Soul except to
whom (in and from the holy Scriptures) the holy
Spirit reveals that Incomprehensible Mystery of a
Mediatour.</P>
<P>A 16th. Instance <HI>of</HI> Foxes <HI>lame writings, is</HI> pag.

<P>For 1. He usually,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Babilonian Jugling, &amp; Egyptian canting</NOTE> and here (as before I have

for saying, a Child of God can not fall from true

<P>4. Here is a <HI>Mystery of hellish Iniquity,</HI> in that

<P>5. It is a <HI>Hellish Mystery</HI> of the <HI>Devil</HI> to Cozen

<P>A <HI>17th. Inst.</HI> is in <HI>ag.</HI> 63. where <HI>G. Fox</HI> brings in

in their particulars, though the words be
spoken without them from the Light.</P>
<P>I Reply, <HI>First,</HI> it is a doleful Business to read and
hear how <HI>Satan</HI> (in his <HI>Chains of Darkness</HI>) yet hath
Liberty to appear abroad as <HI>an Angel of Light</HI> from
Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Devil in Samu|els Mantle</NOTE> thus vapouring and swaggering under the

vapourings and Crakings are but Cheatings from <HI>the
God of this World</HI> whose eyes being beat out by
Gods most righteous Sentence, he labours to keep
all in <HI>blindness,</HI> or to beat out the eyes of those
whom God hath truly enlightned.</P>
<P>2. As I have said before, and I said truly, the
word <HI>Light</HI> is a <HI>Similitude</HI> from <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>darkness</HI>
though my Opposites in the dispute affirmed, that
God was Light in a <HI>proper</HI> and not <HI>figurative Sense,</HI>
and it signifies and intends Truth of all Sorts, whe|ther
<HI>Natural,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Truth and Light the same thing.</NOTE> <HI>Moral</HI> or <HI>Heavenly:</HI> The natural
Truth or Light is received within by a natural
Light or understandings: The Civil and moral
Light or Truth suits and agrees with those moral

understanding? Hither to Natures Light will reach.
But when we mount up to Divine and <HI>Supernatu|ral
Truth,</HI> here these very <HI>Foxians</HI> Confess that <HI>the
Natural Man perceiveth not the things of God:</HI> Only
they say, that beside Natural Light, Natural Reason,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is the holy Seed God and Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
within every Son, and to this Spirit and Seed in
Prison they preach, and <HI>Fox</HI> in our discourses al|leadgeth
and affirmeth God (in every man) to be a

<P>3. All <HI>Light,</HI> or <HI>Truth Natural, Civil,</HI> or <HI>Divine</HI>

<P>4. When I say it comes from <HI>without,</HI> I intend

<PB N="372" REF="193">
<HI>was Elias, Iohn Baptist,</HI> &amp;c. but that he was the

do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A close Compan|ion be|tween all Faculties and Objects.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> that the natural man perceivs no spiritual
matter, but when he is born again then he acts and
works, and it is most certain, that as an House re|ceivs
his Master, as Candle kisseth Candle, the
Clasp the Hook, the mortise the Tenant, so do
Natural or Spiritual Faculties receive <HI>Natural</HI> [34
or <HI>Spiritual Faculties</HI> receive <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Supernatu|ral
Motions</HI> and <HI>Impressions.</HI></P>
<P>The Protestants say, that before it pleaseth God
by some word read, preached, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to set up a Can|dle
of wisdome in the Souls, and to work a spiritual
favour in the Soul, all heavenly matters are nau|seous
and odious, though as pleasant, profitable and
honourable, to self Ends they are welcome all the

<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> saith there is a something,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nothing truly Spi|ritual in Nature as now de|generate.</NOTE> a Seed, though
but as <HI>a Grain of mustard Seed,</HI> a <HI>Seed of God,</HI> of

God is all (within and without:) Hence they main|tain,

there is some heavenly Light: in the

shineth in darkness,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I Answer, <HI>Christ Iesus t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e Sun of Righteousness</HI>
arose with <HI>saving Rayes</HI> or <HI>wings</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> but

what is this to the heart being dead and no Life

<P>6. The Conclusion is (as before I hinted) and
they Confess, when God in his own Means ordina|rily
works the will to hear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods grr|cious workings with and in the Souls of men.</NOTE> to turn, to believe, to

<P>2. From the word <HI>Entos</HI> within you, or amongst

in the midst of them in their <HI>Temple Streets</HI> and

<P>3. The Kingdome of God, that is God and
Christ, and the Spirit were literally in the <HI>Pharisees,</HI>
and so Consequently in every hypocrite in the
World, and every wicked and prophane Sinner,
though they know it not, yea in all Creatures.</P>
<P>But this is against a former, fair Exposition from
the Greek word <HI>Entos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua|kers Ex|position.</NOTE> which cannot be refused
(since so agreeing with the Truth) except Reasons
more prevalent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. The Spirit of God asks, <HI>what agreement be|tween

is shut, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the man within is not only asleep,
but dead and rotten in <HI>Natures silthiness,</HI> and <HI>actual

<P>3. It is against all Colour of Reason to Imagine
that the Lord Jesus should tell the <HI>Iews,</HI> the <HI>Phari|sees,</HI>

their Heart or Tongues said, or Hands hid, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>4. It is notoriously contrary to what G. <HI>Fox,</HI> and
his so often [39] Clamour that the <HI>Kingdome of God
consists in,</HI> or its Nature is in <HI>Righteousness, and Peace
and Ioy in the holy Spirit:</HI> as opposite to the King|dome
in the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and all <HI>Hipocrites</HI> and <HI>pro|phane,</HI> &amp;c. as Hell to Heaven.</P>
<P>5. The thing is so notoriously childish and ri|diculous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The grace of God is offered to all, but em|braced by few that are freely chosen</NOTE>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> that a King should affirm he was an
actual King in his <HI>Enemies Country,</HI> where the

<P>I Reply, More brie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, (having spoken of the
Soul before) That the Soul or Spirit of a Man
should be boundless or without limits, without be|ginning
or ending, is a <HI>Blasphemous Monster</HI> begot|ten
of <HI>Hellish Pride</HI> the Father, and <HI>Hellish Ignor|ance</HI>
the Mother: for Infinity and Infiniteness in
that sence can be no other but the Infinite and
Eternal Power and Godhead transcending the Ca|pacity
or Men or Angels to receive it or conceive
the nature of it.</P>
<P>2. It is true in a secondary way <HI>(a posteriori</HI>) as
they say the Spirits of Angels and men are as a Lamp
lighted by the most high and In- [50] finite Maj|esty
never to go out or be extinguished in joy or
sorrow, This Notion dazles the most sober and
steady Eye and Braine; but who can finde a Cen|tre
or Clod of standing from whence to entertain a
thought of no Beginning; no created finite power
can reach to what Infinity is.</P>
<P>3. We see the mighty Kings and Emperours,
their mighty Armies and Navies have Bounds as
the-roaring Waves of the Ocean have: the most
Glorious Sun and Heavenly Bodies have their limi|ted
Motions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The changes of all things created and their Periods</NOTE> the Dayes and Nights, the Summer and
Winter, the Light and Darkness know their periods
of beginning and ending &amp;c. All have their hith|erto
and no further set by the Infinite, <HI>Eternal</HI>
Arm, &amp; no further. But all the stars of heaven, the
drops of the Ocean, the Sand on the Sea shore, the
<PB N="398" REF="206">
Leaves and Grass of the whole World are all too
short to reach to the thought of one Minute of that
which properly is Gods only propriety, <HI>to wit,</HI> In|finity.</P>
<P>4. Among all the Opinions of the Souls Being
and Rise, this of Infinity making it God himself,
commits two horrible Murthers:<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Add "in its tendency though not in effect." <HI>R. W. s. Ann.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two hor|rible Mur|thers&punc; attempts</NOTE> It Murthers and destroys the Soul.</P>
<P>And Secondly, The Infinite God himself.</P>
<P>For the Soul of Man by such a world of wo|ful
experience being so subject to change, to sins
and sorrows of all sorts. If this should be the In|finity
of the Soul and so of God hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lf, there
would be no Infinity at all so stopt, so limited by
sins and sorrows.</P>
<P>5. We use to say (hyperbollically) that such and
such a doing is Infinite Pride, but surely it is won|derful
and devilish lifting up of the mind of a poor
Earthen Pot, though never so high, so wise, so
learned, so holy to entertain thoughts of being the
Eternal and boundless Infinite power and Godhead.</P>
<P>The blessed Lord proclaime his Infinite Power,
his Infinite Wisdome, his Infinite Greatness, and
Goodness, and Patience to poor sinners (as he did
unto <HI>Iob</HI> out of the Whirlwind) and then for all
<HI>Iobs</HI> Perfection and their own, (which so simply as
well as proudly they prate of) they will with <HI>Iob</HI>
see cause to abhor themselves in Dust and Ashes.</P>
<P>6 Such is the inconceivable Infinity in God be|yond
the reach of all Creatures, that he is not
only Infinite but Infinity it self, [51] Eternity it
<PB N="399" REF="206">
self, Omnipotency it self, Wisdome it self, Good|ness
it self, Justice it self in all their eminences and
perfections.</P>
<P>7. Therefore notwithstanding most gracious and
most glorious Appearances to, and influences from
Infinity, upon poor finite Worms below, sure it is
not so sober a Language as that of Birds and Beasts,

his <HI>Manhood</HI> or <HI>Humanity,</HI> unto <HI>ver.</HI> 21? out of
both which I shall select two or three Attributes
of the Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>1. The State of Christianity, amongst many other
high Expressions in the Scripture, is here called <HI>the
Kingdome of Gods dear Son,</HI> which argues a distinct|ion
from all other Kingdomes, and a distinction
from his <HI>Saints,</HI> as a <HI>King</HI> is not his <HI>Subjects,</HI> nor
their <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Honours,</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> and
<HI>Ioy</HI> though given by him to them,, and procured
by his <HI>great wisdome</HI> and <HI>love</HI> for them.</P>
<P>Oh <HI>poor Ungrateful Monsters,</HI> not content to be
taken from [76] the <HI>Kingdome,</HI> from the <HI>Dungeon,</HI>
of <HI>Darkness</HI> and <HI>Hell,</HI> and that by the <HI>Ransome</HI> and

the Prince of Life,</HI> but we must be the <HI>King of
Heaven</HI> and <HI>Prince of Life</HI> our selves.</P>
<P>2. I observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Blood of Christ. The Blood of God.</NOTE> The <HI>Instrumental</HI> and <HI>purchasing
Cause</HI> or <HI>price,</HI> is said to be his <HI>Blood,</HI> which argues
the <HI>Infinite value</HI> of his Sufferings, in which Res|pect
only it is called <HI>the Blood of God:</HI> I know the
slight esteem that some of these <HI>Foxians</HI> have of the
<HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> saying, that <HI>wicked men</HI> the
<HI>Souldiers</HI> shed it; that it was spilt upon the <HI>ground,</HI>
that there was no difference between that <HI>Blood</HI> and
the <HI>Blood</HI> of another <HI>Saint:</HI> That by <HI>Gods blood</HI> is
only meant <HI>godly</HI> and <HI>heavenly power,</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> by
which God applies Mercy and <HI>pardon, Iustification,
Righteousness,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have read the Blasphemous Discanting of the
<HI>Iesuit</HI> concerning <HI>Maries</HI> white Milk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Blood of Christ des|pised by Papists and Quakers.</NOTE> and Christs

Crimson Blood, &amp; in the close, his preferring the
Milk of the Mother before the Sons Blood.</P>
<P>I have heard also the foolish Blasphemy of one
of my own Neighbours, saying. That the Blood of
the Quakers, and by name of <HI>W. B.</HI> was Saving
and Salvation to the World.</P>
<P>3. But I pass on, The Lord Jesus is here called
the Image of the invisible God:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ the picture of God.</NOTE> If this should res|pect
the Godhead only, which is invisible, how
could Christ be a visible Picture of Invisibility? If
the Manhood only? is God a Man, and Man his
Image or Picture, as the old Heretick, and late in
<HI>London, Reeves</HI> and <HI>Mugleton fancied.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth is, as Christs Blood is but figuratively
for an Antitipe and fulfilling of all the Figures
foregoing him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ God and Man.</NOTE> and for all his Sufferings, and many
Blood-sheddings both of Minde and Body, so this
Image or Picture, this Blessed Lamb of God, con|sisting
of the Godhead, wonderfully assuming such
a <HI>none such Manhood,</HI> both which the <HI>Papists</HI> and
<HI>Quakers</HI> are forced to confess, I say, it is clear he
was the brightest Image or Picture of God to the
World that ever God appeared in, and therefore
called the Word of God the fullest and loudest of
all the Words of God in which ever he spake, &amp;c.</P>
<P>4. Many more I might insist on, but I must ab|breviate,
and only mention <HI>ver.</HI> 18. where the Lord
Jesus is made the Pallace of [77] the Godhead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ Fulness filling all.</NOTE>

amongst us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonder|ful Con|duit.</NOTE> &amp;c. was as a fair and spacious, beauti|ful
Conduit, into which the eternal and inconceiv|able

flowed, and from whom by all those blessed means

let loose, flow and run into poor empty Souls as
Pails and Tankards all sorts of mercies to the whole

his Church and Body that believe in him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proud phrenzie of the Quakers.</NOTE> what
poor Children and Frantick Souls are we then that

God &amp; Christ &amp; his Saints, yea, though he

<P>The Truth is, when God gives forth a word or
Command by <HI>Angels,</HI> by <HI>Men,</HI> and by other of his
<HI>Armies,</HI> (wherein his <HI>Infinite Power</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI>
daily appeareth) his word runneth very swiftly, as

have many Sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ the word of God</NOTE> yet Christ Jesus (that man Christ

<P>5. Contrary to the <HI>Ordinary</HI> and <HI>Constant feeding</HI>

<P>3. Many had, and may have the <HI>speaking with

<P>4. <HI>In the</HI> Ordinary Teaching <HI>to Conversion, the

<P>6. What is there in G. <HI>Fox</HI> his wild Notion,
<HI>[Can that which brings Salvation be outward?</HI>] Against

<P>Object. <HI>He saith,</HI> The grace of God teacheth every

<P>1. If every man in the world hath this <HI>Imme|mediate
<PB N="454" REF="234">
work</HI> on them? what's the Reason we find
none in the world (no not the wisest) until they
have the Scripture, or the Doctrine thereof some
way opened to them, that have been able to give
us the least Tidings of any such business.</P>
<P>2. What's the Reason that so few in the world
have any shew of Repentance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> much less a
sound and and saving turning of the whole Soul
unto God?</P>
<P>87] Why do the <HI>Quakers</HI> make such adoe about
their <HI>Apostles</HI> Men and Women as if that <HI>glorious
Light</HI> the <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> in every man were
not able to teach <HI>Effectually</HI> (by his <HI>Extraordinary</HI>
and <HI>miraculous power</HI>) without their outward speak|ing
to the <HI>Seed,</HI> that is to <HI>God within</HI> them?</P>
<P>4. If they themselves teach by such an <HI>Extraor|dinary</HI>
and <HI>miraculous power</HI> as the Prophets of old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miracles.</NOTE>
and the Apostles of Christ Jesus did, what should
be the Cause why we see no such <HI>miraculous deeds</HI>
done by any of them? The Truth is, God is pleased
to chain up <HI>Sathan:</HI> otherwise, the <HI>Foxians</HI> would
have their longing (which it may be some shall
after them) But if they shall be permitted by God
and assisted by the <HI>Devil</HI> to do as the <HI>Magicians</HI>
did: yet if their <HI>Doctrine</HI> be other then what is
written (as I have abundantly proved it to be) while
they cry out <HI>Light, Light,</HI> there is none as <HI>Isaiah</HI>
speaketh, not a Spark of <HI>Light</HI> within them.</P>

<P>But, 1. Was this (as he speaks) without all dis|tinction

<P>I <HI>Answer,</HI> The holy spirit testifies that he is the
Comforter of the saints, but a Reprover of the World,
that he Comforts the [103] Saints in the Promi|ses,

in his Threatenings and Judgments.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spi|rit of God and the world are extream Contraries</NOTE> That the

<P>But come to the time of the Lord Jesus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great failing of Christs Disciples</NOTE> and

<HI>Heavenly Converse,</HI> his <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>Powerful Spirit</HI> in

negligence, unbelief, forgetfulness, Inhu|manity,
Ambition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>And as to <HI>Peter,</HI> to say nothing of his stupendi|ous

1. I <HI>Reply,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">G Fox hath affirmed the Con|trary to all the Heavenly Assertions of his Opposites which I have produced.</NOTE> This bewitched and bewitching Soul
hath all along his Book been picking out sweet
Flowers out of his Opposites Gardens, from whence
he hath suckt, turned the sweet juice of Heavenly
Truths into the poyson and Venome of his proud
Conceits. So here he denies this <HI>Heavenly Mystery</HI>
of Gods revealing himself to us after the way and
manner of men, having Head, and Hair, and Eyes,
and mouth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherein his Incomprehensible
Goodness is pleased to stoop to us (even the high|est
and proudest Souls) as Nurses do to Children,
or as Physitians to weak and Crazy and distempered
persons.</P>
<P>2. But what shall we say to all those holy Scrip|tures,
which not only liken God to a man, a man
of war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God sets forth to us in Scripture by Natural and Arti|ficial things.</NOTE> a Sheepherd, a <HI>Warfaring man,</HI> an <HI>Husband
man,</HI> &amp;c. but also to a Shield, and other Insensibles,
Natural or Artificial, as a Sun, a Tree, a Rock, an
House, a Fort, a High Tower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When God
revealed himself to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 15. <HI>I am thy
Shield,</HI> &amp;c. will this foul mouth say that this simili|tude
of a Shield was not a <HI>Familiar Metaphor,</HI> or
<HI>Figure,</HI> wherein God speaks to <HI>Abrahams weak Ca|pacity?</HI>
Or will he say, that God speaking so to
<HI>Abraham,</HI> spake not also in the way the Spirit, Or
that God is Literally a Shield?</P>
<P>3. It was a late Speech of one of the best Phi|losophers,
and of the best Christians that <HI>Old Eng|land</HI>
or <HI>New</HI> ever had: Then shall we know (to

God?</HI> But this <HI>poor wild Asses Colt,</HI> G. <HI>Fox</HI> he can
