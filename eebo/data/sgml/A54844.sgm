<P>I hope his Calumnies of <HI>Grotius,</HI> and the <HI>Episcopal Divines,</HI> will now obtaine the less credit with his most credulous Admirers, for that he hath poured out <HI>the same</HI> (and a great deal <HI>worse</HI>) against a per|son of great remarke amongst <HI>the Counsellours of State.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Compare <HI>The Vindication of Sir Henry Vane,</HI> with Mr. <HI>Baxter's</HI> unchristian usage of him in his <HI>Key for Catholicks.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Vani</HI> or <HI>Vanists</HI> (for he is pleas'd to

The former brought forth ma|ny (neer</HI> 30.) <HI>Monstrous Births at once, and was after slain by the</HI> Indians. <HI>This providence</HI> (he add's) <HI>should have awakened the Parliament to a wise and godly jealousie of the Counsells and Designs of him that was in</HI> New-England, <HI>the Master of the Game, and to have carefully searched how much of his Doctrine and design were from heaven, and how much of them he brought with him from</HI> Italy, <HI>or at least was begotten by the Progenitor of Monsters.</HI> And lest his Readers should be to seek on <HI>whom</HI> he fasten's such ugly ca|lumnies, he frequently <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 319, 329, 338.</NOTE> nameth Sir <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> neither regarding the <HI>Quality,</HI> or <HI>Learned parts</HI> of that <HI>Knight,</HI> nor any the least <HI>Reverence</HI> or <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Of this, and many the like prancks, I am particu|larly concern'd to take some notice, first because
<PB REF="4">
Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> hath coupled <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 391.</NOTE> the <HI>Vani</HI> with Mr. <HI>P.</HI> And both with four sorts of men, by whom the <HI>Popish design is kept on foot</HI>; to wit the <HI>Seekers,</HI> the <HI>Infidels,</HI> the <HI>Behmenists,</HI> and the <HI>Quakers.</HI> Next because mine <HI>own</HI> sufferings have taught me to look with indignation on <HI>other Men's,</HI> how little soever <HI>their</HI> principles agree with <HI>mine.</HI> And though I suppose Sir <HI>Henry Vane</HI> is very far from being partiall to the <HI>Episcopal Divines,</HI> (with whom I will rather choose to suffer the greatest <HI>hardships,</HI> than embrace the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> 4.4.</NOTE> <HI>Friendship of the world,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>H b.</HI> 11.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5.</NOTE> <HI>or enjoy the pleasures of Sin for a season,</HI>) yet are we bound to do him <HI>right,</HI> and to be sensible of his <HI>wrongs,</HI> and to afford him that deference, which both his <HI>Birth</HI> and his <HI>Breeding</HI> have made his <HI>due.</HI> When St <HI>Paul</HI> had to do with a <HI>person</HI> of <HI>honour</HI> amongst the <HI>Heathen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts</HI> 26.25.</NOTE> he was so <HI>civil</HI> as to call him <HI>most no|ble Festus.</HI> And he is sure a <HI>grosse Christian,</HI> who think's it his duty to be a <HI>Clown.</HI> I cannot tell what judgement that Learned Gentleman may be of; but he hath this commendation (as well as <HI>Grotius) that he is hated by</HI> Mr. <HI>Baxter beyond all measure</HI>; and is sufficiently <HI>averse to the Presbyteri|ans.</HI></P>
<P>Christian Reader, have the patience to be <HI>pre-admonish'd</HI> of one thing more. The <HI>greatest</HI> abuse and the most <HI>groundlesse</HI> which I have suffer'd from Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> (in no less than three distinct Volumes) is his indeavour to represent me, as an <HI>Enemy to Pu|rity and pious life.</HI> Which however he hath done in as <HI>grosse</HI> a manner, as if he had tryed to what <HI>Extremities</HI> both of <HI>absurdity</HI> and <HI>Falshood,</HI> depra|ved Man may be transported by abusing the <HI>Liber|ty</HI>
<PB REF="5">
of his <HI>Will,</HI> (which God could never <HI>predetermine</HI> to such <HI>uncleannesse,</HI>) yet <HI>some</HI> at least of his <HI>Fol|lowers</HI> who have never yet <HI>seen</HI> him without his <HI>Vizard,</HI> have been betrayed by that <HI>confidence</HI> (with which he hath written <HI>against his Conscience</HI>) to incourage his <HI>calumnies</HI> with their <HI>belief.</HI> As for <HI>reason,</HI> or <HI>proof,</HI> he hath not <HI>offer'd</HI> any thing to|wards it, but to supply that defect, he hath thought it enough to <HI>declaim</HI> against me, for being <HI>supposed</HI> to have <HI>declaim'd</HI> against <HI>Purit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nes,</HI> neither naming <HI>any one passage</HI> in any papers which I had publish'd, nor so much as <HI>referring to any page</HI> where any such <HI>passage</HI> was to be <HI>found.</HI> I received letters of inquiry, [<HI>where</HI> I had written against <HI>Puritanes,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> should so <HI>largely</HI> rebuke me for it before the world? My answer was, that <HI>I never did it,</HI> for ought I was able to <HI>remember</HI>; and that untill Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> could shew me <HI>where,</HI> I should not believe I had been <HI>forgetfull.</HI> Indeed I <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>ch.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 75.</NOTE> ci|ted that part of <HI>King Iames</HI> his <HI>Letter,</HI> which told the Bishops <HI>they had to do with two sorts of Ene|mies, Papists and Puritanes, and will'd them to goe forward against the one and the other.</HI> But it ap|peare's by these words, not that I, or Archbishop <HI>Spotswood,</HI> (by whom the Letter is recorded) but that <HI>King Iames, who writ the Letter, had sharply written against Puritanes.</HI> In so much that Mr. <HI>Bax|ter</HI> hath dealt with <HI>me,</HI> as he hath also dealt with Sir <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> whom he <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Key for Cath. p.</HI> 331.</NOTE> supposeth to have brought <HI>Corrupt Opinions out of</HI> Italy, when it ap|peare's that Sir <HI>Henry</HI> was <HI>never there.</HI></P>
<P>But now <HI>admit</HI> that I had written against the Pu|ritanes, before his clamour was put in print, (as
<PB REF="5">
very possibly I did, though I professe I know not <HI>where,</HI> and much desire to be inform'd) yet I had done no other thing, than had been donby the most eminent in point of <HI>Piety, Learning, Iudg|ment</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> from the dayes of Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> to these our <HI>own.</HI> And if <HI>I</HI> am an <HI>Enemy to Religion</HI> for having cited the words of <HI>others,</HI> what will be said by Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> of Archbishop <HI>Whitgift,</HI> Archbishop <HI>Bancroft,</HI> Judicious <HI>Hooker,</HI> Judge <HI>Pop|ham,</HI> Bishop <HI>Andrews,</HI> Bishop <HI>Carleton,</HI> Bishop <HI>Hall,</HI> Dr. <HI>Sanderson,</HI> (with divers others, whom I have cited in the <HI>first Chapter</HI> of this Book) whose just severity to the <HI>Puritanes</HI> may serve to put Mr. <HI>Bax|ter</HI> to <HI>shame</HI> and <HI>silence.</HI></P>
<P>If he means no more than <HI>this,</HI> that I have cited out of the Writings of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotish Presby|terians,</HI> their <HI>own</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">&rindx;See <HI>The Sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Re|venger exem|plified ch.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Confessions</HI> of their <HI>own princi|ples</HI> and <HI>practise</HI> too, he should have honestly told his Readers, that I had written no worse of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> than <HI>themselves</HI> had written of <HI>them|selves.</HI> Nor should he have called <HI>them Puritanes,</HI> whom I had called <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> (as themselves in their Writings have call'd themselves) unless he was willing to acknowledge that they were <HI>both</HI> the <HI>same thing.</HI> Observe (good Reader) how the Case stands between us. It is <HI>confessed</HI> by Mr. <HI>Knox,</HI> that <HI>Iames Melvin</HI> (with two more) did privately <HI>murder</HI> the <HI>Archbp.</HI> of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> which the same Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> doth withall <HI>commend</HI> for <HI>a Godly Fact.</HI> This <HI>Con|fession</HI> I <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> observed, and shewed his <HI>page</HI> where it is <HI>printed.</HI> Again by 52. <HI>Ministers of the Province of London</HI> it was <HI>confessed</HI> (from the <HI>presse</HI> too) that <HI>in+stead of a Reformation they had a Deformation in Re|ligion,

What may now be the reason, that Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> pursues me with so much Rancor? Was it my fault that the things were printed, (without my knowledge or consent) and printed by the Authors from whom I had them? Or may not a man <HI>relate</HI> a passage, as he find's it printed before his eyes? Which was <HI>worst</HI> of the <HI>two,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> the Presbyterian <HI>commended Murder,</HI> or that a man of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> did fairly <HI>cite</HI> his commendation? Let it be judg'd by my wri|tings, and by the Authors whom I produce, whe|ther I am so like an <HI>Enemy</HI> to <HI>Christian purity,</HI> as they (who say it) are <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Fautors</HI> to the most <HI>Heathenish Impurity</HI> to be imagin'd.</P>
<P>And because I have met with a sort of men, who having been <HI>led</HI> by <HI>blind guides,</HI> have stuck so fast in the <HI>ditch</HI> of <HI>error,</HI> as to believe the word <HI>Puritane</HI> is of a faire signification, and import's a man of a <HI>pious life,</HI> I think it my duty to <HI>declare,</HI> (before I admit them to read my Book) that whensoever I shall be found to speak severe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y concerning <HI>Puri|tanes,</HI> (and that in meer satisfaction to Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>) I mean <HI>no other</HI> then have been meant by Bishop <HI>Andrewes</HI> of blesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Memory, or by the learned and Reverend Dr. <HI>Sand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">son,</HI> with other persons of re|nown hereafter mention'd. <HI>Puritanes</HI> properly are things, which being inwardly full of <HI>Filth,</HI> do ei|ther esteem themselves <HI>pure,</HI> or would fain by <HI>o|thers</HI> be so esteemed.

<P>In the Title of your book, you pretend a <HI>vindication</HI> of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> &amp;c. as if you would intimate to your Readers that I had <HI>wrong'd</HI> them.

And I had good reason for it, because you h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d said in plain <HI>English,</HI> that a man must be <HI>wickeder</HI> then <HI>David</HI> was at his <HI>worst,</HI> before he could be said to be <HI>notoriously ungodly,</HI> or in a <HI>state of damnation.</HI> And considering the <HI>ground</HI> (or <HI>quick-sand</HI> rather) upon which you build such killing Doctrine; I thought my self bound to leave an <HI>Antidote</HI>

<P>My Argument from hence is short and easie. For if <HI>Grotius</HI> were really a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, he was reconciled to that Church, either 1&punc; <HI>before,</HI> or 2&punc; <HI>at</HI> his death, (for
<PB N="28" REF="27">
<HI>after</HI> his death, <HI>you</HI> have onely reconciled him in <HI>your opi|nion,</HI> without his knowledge or consent,) or 3. at least he thought himself obliged to <HI>call</HI> (at his death) for such a reconciliation; and so, <HI>voto saltem,</HI> at least in <HI>wish</HI> or <HI>de|sire,</HI> (that is, as much as in him lay) to <HI>seek</HI> the peace of that Church from which he had lived so long <HI>divided.</HI> Not the first, for then he never would have <HI>received</HI> the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Minister as he <HI>did</HI>; much lesse (as he <HI>did</HI>) have purposely <HI>sent</HI> for him.

I use. Notes as much as any man, when I take pains, and as little as any man, when I am lazy, or busie, or have not leisure to prepare. It is easier to preach three Sermons without Notes, then one with them.</HI></Q>] If it is really <HI>so,</HI> as here you say, that the <HI>using of Notes</HI> is for the <HI>good of the hearers,</HI> and for the bet|ter performance of Gods <HI>work,</HI> then indeed I have been guilty of great <HI>omissions</HI> towards my <HI>flock</HI>: for in all the course of my Ministery, I never made any use of Notes. But I have this for my excuse, that I was char|ged <HI>not</HI> to use them, by very venerable persons, when I was first ordained to be a Preacher. And the reasons given for it were these especially; first because your <HI>reading Preachers</HI> were more <HI>despised</HI> at that time, then of late they have been, (and where the <HI>Preachers</HI> is not <HI>valued,</HI> the <HI>Sermon</HI> finds the less <HI>attention.</HI>) Next because such a Preacher as speaks out of his <HI>memory,</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="57">
is better able to speak out of his <HI>heart and mind,</HI> then one who is <HI>often,</HI> or <HI>altogether</HI> forced to look into his book. Not will his work be so <HI>lifeless,</HI> as when he reads. He will not be so very apt to <HI>preach his Auditory asleep,</HI> (which you modestly condemn in your self and others.) But since you say the <HI>use of notes</HI> is for the <HI>benefit of the hearers,</HI> and since I know they are used by many eminent Preachers besides your self, I begin to suspect my former <HI>judgment,</HI> and per|haps may change my <HI>practice</HI> too. For as I never thought the worse of others whom I have known to use Notes, or the better of my self for having never us'd any, so have you given me an occasion to put my self on this question, whether I have not been faulty in bestowing <HI>that time</HI> to put my Sermons into my <HI>memory,</HI> which might better have been imployed in making them <HI>worthy</HI> to be <HI>remem|bred.</HI> I am really in a strait, and apt to state it in the <HI>affirmative</HI>; for he who spends his <HI>whole time,</HI> in giving <HI>weight</HI> and <HI>worth</HI> to his <HI>compositions,</HI> may make them useful for the <HI>publick,</HI> and fit to be preached from the <HI>Press</HI>; whereas the man that is obliged to speak <HI>at large</HI> upon a <HI>little,</HI> and to content himself with the <HI>sudden effusions</HI> of his soul, can attain to nothing beyond the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> where he speaks little else, then what must <HI>perish</HI> whilest it is <HI>spoken.</HI> I do intend (if God permit) to make a trial of <HI>your way</HI>; and if I shall find it to be the better, will never return un|to <HI>mine own.</HI></P>

<P N="4"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In four re|spects.</HI></NOTE><HI>Sect.</HI> 4. Thus you make me not onely a kind of <HI>Seminary Priest,</HI> but one who hath <HI>counterfeited the Protestant</HI> in such a Dangerous Degree, as to have gotten into a <HI>Rectory</HI> where I have daily opportunities to serve the <HI>Pope</HI>; and so by consequence being discover'd by the subtil Endeavours of Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> I am lyable to die a most <HI>shameful Death.</HI> An Imputation the more hainous in these following re|spects.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> because you had a <HI>warning</HI> in my <GAP DESC="foreign">, not to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ps. 50.20.</NOTE> <HI>slander</HI> any man Living, much lesse a Man whom you must reckon to be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ps. 50.20.</NOTE><HI>your own Mothers son,</HI> if you pretend to be a <HI>son</HI> of the <HI>Church of Engl.</HI> much less with a plot to bring in <HI>Popery,</HI> rather than <HI>Iudaism,</HI> or <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> or whatever else is most <HI>absurd.</HI> For though I earnestly pray for the peace of Christendom, and think as well of the
<PB N="167" REF="96">
<HI>Papists,</HI> as an unpassionate Protestant may be allowed, yet do I abhor being a <HI>Papist,</HI> as much as being a <HI>Presbyterian</HI>; and will as soon be a <HI>Turk,</HI> as I will be either. Compare my <HI>praemonition</HI> before the book above-mention'd, with the <HI>beginning</HI> of the <HI>first</HI> Chapter, and with the <HI>middle</HI> of the <HI>third,</HI> that you may see the <HI>aggravations</HI> of your of|fence.</P>
<P>Next, because it is a <HI>groundless,</HI> and so by consequence a <HI>spiteful, inhuman charge.</HI> For where have I ever <HI>defended Popery</HI>? Or when did I write <HI>one word</HI> for <HI>Grotianism,</HI> as you expound it by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> 381.</NOTE> <HI>Popery?</HI> Or where did I ever use the <HI>word</HI>? Name the <HI>booke,</HI> and the <HI>page,</HI> and the <HI>nu|merical lines</HI> which I have written, if I have written any such thing. Are you an <HI>Answerer of Books,</HI> whilst you <HI>forge,</HI> and <HI>falsifie,</HI> and declaim at random against your <HI>Dreams,</HI> to which you entitle your <HI>Brother's Name,</HI> with|out directing your Readers to any one <HI>page,</HI> or <HI>expression,</HI> whereby to give some <HI>colour</HI> to your Inventions? What <HI>unstudied Gentleman have I seduced</HI>? or where are the <HI>foot|steps</HI> which I have <HI>troden,</HI> towards the management of a <HI>plot</HI> to bring in <HI>Popery</HI>? for shame do somwhat like a <HI>Man,</HI> (if not at all like a <HI>Christian</HI>) either to <HI>prove</HI> I am a <HI>Papist,</HI> or to make me at least some <HI>Reparations,</HI> in as <HI>publick</HI> a manner as you have wrong'd me.</P>
<P>Thirdly, because your <HI>Accusation</HI> could not but flie in|to your Face, and significantly call you a <HI>false-Accuser.</HI> For you know it never was my profession, that I was of <HI>Grotius his Religion,</HI> (let his Religion have been what it would) but rather that <HI>Grotius</HI> was of <HI>mine,</HI> by being a <HI>Protestant</HI> and a <HI>Peacemaker.</HI> If I was <HI>mistaken</HI> in my opi|nion, you should have gather'd from thence, <HI>that I am fal|lible</HI>; not at all, that <HI>I am a Papist</HI>; because a man may be a <HI>Protestant,</HI> and yet be <HI>mistaken</HI> in his opinion. You are a wilful Deviator from the Thing under Dispute, and shall be made to <HI>acknowledge</HI> that you are such. For it is not our Question, <HI>Whether Grotian Popery is Good</HI>; but, <HI>whether Grotius</HI> (good man) was indeed a <HI>Papist.</HI> Had I <HI>affirm'd</HI> the <HI>former,</HI> I might have been liable to your charge; but
<PB N="168" REF="97">
you know I onely <HI>denyed the latter</HI>; and cannot con|ceive any such thing as <HI>Grotian Popery,</HI> more then any such thing as <HI>Baxterian Paganism.</HI> For though you <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ints Rest. Edit.</HI> 2. <HI>part</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 155, 156.</NOTE> <HI>favour</HI> the <HI>Pagans,</HI> yet doth it not follow that you are <HI>one.</HI> Even <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ther,</HI> and <HI>Zuinglius,</HI> and I think <HI>Paraeus,</HI> do hope for Sal|vation for diverse Pagans, although the two latter were <HI>Presbyterians.</HI> You are not so thick of understanding, as not to be able to distinguish between a <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> and a <HI>matter of Faith.</HI> From whence it follow's that you are <HI>wilful,</HI> and speak in <HI>despight</HI> to your understanding, when, the Question being put [<HI>whether</HI> Grotius <HI>de Facto turn'd Papist, or not</HI>] you tell the world I am a <HI>Papist</HI> because I think that <HI>he</HI> was <HI>none.</HI> There may be men of <HI>both</HI> parties of <HI>both</HI> opinions in point of <HI>Fact,</HI> whilst yet they retain their Parties too. Nay the Question may be put to a <HI>Ma|humetan, or a Iew,</HI> who retaining their <HI>own</HI> Religions may judge impartially of a <HI>Christian,</HI> whether they think he ei|ther <HI>changed,</HI> or changed <HI>not</HI> his Religion, for that of the <HI>Iews,</HI> or the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> It was lately a Question twixt Dr. <HI>Bernard</HI> and my self, whether the Primate of <HI>Armagh</HI> had chang'd his Judgment: wherein though <HI>He</HI> was of one mind, and I of another, yet I did not infer, that <HI>He</HI> was a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> nor <HI>He,</HI> that I was an <HI>Arminian.</HI> The Question being not put concerning what we <HI>approve,</HI> but concerning the <HI>Truth</HI> of the thing done. So in the Case of <HI>Grotius,</HI> it is not dispu|ted by <HI>you,</HI> and <HI>me,</HI> whether <HI>Grotius</HI> did <HI>well</HI> in <HI>turning Pa|pist,</HI> (for if he turn'd Papist, we <HI>both condemn</HI> him,) but whether he actually <HI>did,</HI> or <HI>did not</HI> turn Papist. And to say he <HI>did,</HI> when he did <HI>not,</HI> is not to <HI>oppose,</HI> but to <HI>make</HI> a Pa|pist. He <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">look back on <HI>ch.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 11. <HI>Arg.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>affirm'd</HI> that he <HI>did not,</HI> and I <HI>believe</HI> his affir|mation. But it is not <HI>Popery,</HI> to take a man upon his word; if it is, you are a <HI>Papist</HI> for the very same reason: for cer|tainly there are Papists, whom you <HI>believe</HI> when they <HI>tell</HI> you that they are Papists. Behold the Case in another Colour. The <HI>Iansenians</HI> do profess to <HI>detest</HI> the severall propositions, which were condemned by <HI>Pope Innocent</HI>: but <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Consulatur <HI>Mysterium Ie|suit.</HI></NOTE> <HI>approving</HI> the Pope's <HI>Sentence,</HI> they deny the <HI>Fact,</HI> to wit that <HI>Iansenius</HI> affirm'd the <HI>Contrary</HI>: (where by the way
<PB N="169" REF="97">
let it be noted, that either <HI>Austin</HI> and <HI>Iansenius</HI> are of the Judgment that I am for, Or their greatest friends and Abettors are no less Oppugners of the Calvinists than the <HI>Molinists</HI> themselves;) will you say they <HI>love</HI> what they <HI>de|test,</HI> because they deny that <HI>Iansenius</HI> said it? you will be hooted at, if you do, as a very <HI>strange Creature.</HI> And yet you have done as absur'd a thing. For I am a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> different from a Papist, as any Protestant can be of the Church of England. Yet because I deny that <HI>Grotius turn'd Papist,</HI> you make no scruple, to call me Papist for my reward. A Calumny favouring of as much weakness, as if St. <HI>Basil</HI> should have pronounced <HI>Athanasius</HI> himself to have turn|ed <HI>Arian,</HI> for conceiving all to be <HI>Orthodox</HI> in <HI>Dionysius</HI> his Writings (of <HI>Alexandria,</HI>) in which, St. <HI>Basil</HI> was of opinion, that something of <HI>Arianism</HI> was couched.</P>
<P>Fourthly, your Accusation is the more hainous, because it reacheth to the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">shonourning</HI> of the <HI>Ablest Protestants</HI> in the world, who <HI>deny</HI> that Grotius turn'd Papist, as well as I.

of Schism and Haeresie,</HI> that our Church being divided may become odious, and men be prepared for a Remove.

The fifth part of it is, <HI>to keep afoot a party of learned Men, who under the Name of Presbyterians may keep an Interest in the people, and partly draw them from Unity, and from obey|ing their Superiours by pretending a Necessity to abolish Epis|copacy and Presbytery, and to set up Presbytery in its stead,</HI> or somewhat else without a Name, expressed at random by <HI>The Scepter and Way of Christ,</HI> thereby to <HI>widen our Brea|ches, and so prepare a way for Popery.</HI></P>

But no one man can now performe all these to so many hundreds of Parishes as are in one Dioecess; Ergo our Dioece|san Bishop is not the same with the Antient Bishop.</HI></P>
<P>This being the summe of your chiefest Argument, may be enlarged (by my consent) in the <HI>Major Proposition,</HI> to the utmost pitch of advantage, to which your <HI>own heart</HI> can wish the difficulty improved; to wit by urging that the Bishops were at first invested by the Apostles, with <HI>all manner</HI> of <HI>Ecclesiasticall</HI> both <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Office.</HI> And so the <HI>Bishop</HI> in every <HI>Dioecesse,</HI> being lineally the <HI>successor</HI> of that <HI>numerical Bishop</HI> who was <HI>ordained</HI> by the Apostles, is by consequence invested with <HI>all this</HI> power.

<Q>The Scripture-Bishops were the Pastors of particular Churches, having no Presbyters subject to them. Most of our Ordainers are such Pastors: Therefore most of our Ordainers are Scripture-Bishops.</Q>
The <HI>major</HI> of this Syllogism you prove from Dr. <HI>Ham|mond,</HI>
and the <HI>minor</HI> from Mr. <HI>Pierce.</HI> At least you are
<HI>confident</HI> that you <HI>prove</HI> it; though I shall prove you prove
nothing, except your <HI>forgetfulness of Logick,</HI> and some|what
else to your prejudice, of which anon.</P>
<P N="2">2.

you are obnoxious to the publick assertion of D. <HI>Kendal,</HI> that <HI>a little more of the university would have done you no harm.</HI></P>

Sup|pose (in the person of <HI>Diogenes</HI>) you were to prove that a <HI>Cock with his Feathers strips from him alive,</HI> is a <HI>Man</HI> as well as <HI>Plato,</HI> though not as able to <HI>teach School</HI>; you may thus argue for <HI>him,</HI> as you have done for <HI>your self.</HI>
<Q>A man is a living Creature with two feet and without Feathers- A Cock deplumed (like that of <HI>Diogenes)</HI> is such a living Creaturo: Therefore a Cock deplumed (like that of <HI>Diogenes</HI>) is a man.</Q>
But then you have taught an <HI>ill Sophistry</HI> against your self.
For the plainest person in all your Parish may prove you to
be an arrant <HI>He athen</HI> by the very same <HI>Logick</HI> which you
have <HI>err'd by.</HI>
<Q>An arrant Heathen is an Animal indued with reason <HI>Mr.</HI> Baxter is an Animal indued with reason: Therefore <HI>Mr.</HI> Baxter is an arrant Heathen.</Q>
The <HI>major</HI> at least must be <HI>as true,</HI> as that which you take
from Dr. <HI>Hammond.</HI> The <HI>minor</HI> infinitly <HI>truer,</HI> than that
which you take from Mr. <HI>Pierce.</HI> And you know the <HI>con|clusion</HI>
is undeniable. For if the premises are <HI>true, Falshood</HI>
cannot flow from them by any <HI>regular</HI> Deduction. And
if the Deduction is <HI>irregular,</HI> why is your dealing the ve|ry
<HI>same,</HI> to prove your <HI>irregular Ordinations</HI> exactly <HI>re|gular</HI>?</P>
<P N="4">4.

with that <HI>vulgar Catachresis.</HI> But in the use of <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>antient Writers,</HI> Pastor signifies <HI>him,</HI> to whom the charge of the Flock is <HI>Originally</HI> intrusted; whereas our English acception of the word <HI>Rector</HI> (which is not the <HI>Scriptural</HI> or <HI>antient</HI> stile) is wholly extended to a <HI>de|puted</HI> or <HI>partiary Government</HI> in the Church, to wit, a Go|vernment over <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>Pastors Diocess,</HI> which <HI>Pastor</HI> (in the old stile) hath the <HI>plenary charge</HI> committed to him. Your error therefore was very great, in confounding the <HI>Pastors</HI> with the <HI>Rectors of the people,</HI> unless you spake with the <HI>vulgar</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">; and supposing that so you did, you spake completely <HI>besides the purpose.</HI> And whereas you say in your Margin, [Mr. <HI>T.

<P>Having done with your Argument, and with your perso|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all reflection, I shall observe but one thing more; to wit
<PB N="239" REF="132">
that whilst you say <HI>most</HI> of your Ordainers are such Pastors, as Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> spake of in Scripture-times, (which yet I hope you will retract) you imply a confession, that <HI>some are not.</HI> Nor can I see by what meanes you will excuse your selves unto your selves, for having admitted of <HI>such Or|dainers.</HI> As for your second and third sentences in your <HI>Sect.</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI> 199.

<P N="38"><HI>Sect.</HI> 38. In your <HI>seventh Chapter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Presbyterians are not Bishops by having Dea|cons under them.</HI></NOTE> p. 203. Sect. 18. You again pretend to fetch an Argument from the words of the Reverend Dr. <HI>Hammond.</HI> Your naked affirmation is ex|press'd in these words. <HI>Where there are no such Presbyters with a President, it is yet enough to prove him a Bishop, that he hath Deacons under him, or but one Deacon.</HI> Your pre|tended proof of this assertion is from the words of Doctor <HI>H.</HI> which now ensue. [When the Gospel was first preached by the Apostles, and but few converted, they ordained in every City and Region no more but a Bishop, and one or more Deacons to attend him, there being at the present so small store out of which to take more, and so small need of ordaining more.] Reduce this proofe into a <HI>Syllogisme,</HI> which may serve your interest in any measure, and it will be like your <HI>former,</HI> most dishonoura|bly <HI>false.</HI> For thus you <HI>must</HI> form it, (do what you can) if you intend to make it in <HI>imitation</HI> of a <HI>proof.</HI>
<Q><P>A primitive Bishop had no more then a Deacon or Dea|cons to attend him: A Presbyter hath no more then a Deacon or Deacons to attend him: therefore a Presbyter is a Primitive Bishop.</P></Q>
Here you see are three <HI>affirmatives</HI> in the <HI>second Figure.</HI>
And by an Argument so form'd I will prove you to be <HI>any|thing</HI> (either Fish, or Fowle,) with which you have any
the <HI>least Agreement.</HI> Reduce your proof then (a second
time) into a <HI>syllogisme</HI> truly made, and your case will be
<HI>alter'd,</HI> but nothing <HI>mended.</HI> Your fall into the <HI>Fire</HI> will
indeed be <HI>regular,</HI> but you will get no more by it, than if
you continue in the <HI>frying-pan.</HI>
<Q><PB REF="133">
<P><HI>For your</HI> truly form'd <HI>Syllogism will be but thus,</HI> who|soever hath none but a Deacon or Deacons to attend him is a Primitive Bishop: A Presbyter hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one but a Deacon or Deacons to attend him: Therefore a Presbyter is a Primitive Bishop.</P></Q>
Here the <HI>matter</HI> is as untoward, as the <HI>Form</HI> was before.
The <HI>Major</HI> proposition being admirably <HI>false.</HI> For though
a man may be a <HI>Bishop</HI> who hath <HI>no more,</HI> to attend him,
when no more are to be <HI>had</HI>; (and that because <HI>no more</HI> are
<HI>needfull,</HI> which is the thing that Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> hath of|ten
taught you) yet his having <HI>no more,</HI> doth not prove
him to be a <HI>Bishop,</HI> which was the thing to be proved from
Dr. <HI>Hammond.</HI> When <HI>Ignatius</HI> reckons the <HI>Three</HI> Orders,
<HI>Bishops, Priests,</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> 'tis as impossible for him to
meane, that <HI>Priests</HI> are <HI>Bishops,</HI> as that <HI>Deacons</HI> are <HI>Priests.</HI>
For though <HI>every Bishop</HI> is a <HI>Priest,</HI> it can no more follow
that <HI>every Priest</HI> is a <HI>Bishop,</HI> than it can possibly follow that
<HI>every Animal is a man,</HI> because it is true, that <HI>every man
is an Animal.</HI> A Primitive <HI>Bishop</HI> and a meer <HI>Presbyter</HI>
may have a <HI>Conversion per Accidens,</HI> and another <HI>conversion
by Contraposition,</HI> but a <HI>simple conversion</HI> they cannot have.
To <HI>say</HI> they can, without <HI>proof,</HI> is but the begging of the
Question; which being sure to be <HI>denyed</HI> you, I shall ad|vise
you to beg no more.</P>
<P>I will conclude this subject with a remarkable passage of Mr. <HI>Thorndike.</HI> And I will do it so much the rather, be|cause the <HI>weightiness</HI> and the <HI>price</HI> of that excellent Vo|lume may probably keep it from the perusal of vulgar Rea|ders, who onely meddle with the cheapest Bookes.</P>

<P>I say the <HI>Author</HI> for this good reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es God the Author of sin in a way of expression more unexcu|sable.</HI></NOTE> because he must needs be the <HI>Author</HI> of every thing which he <HI>produceth,</HI> and he must needs <HI>produce</HI> every thing, which it <HI>belongeth</HI> to him to <HI>produce</HI>: and Mr. <HI>Hickman</HI> is express in his <HI>fourth assertion</HI> above cited, that <HI>it belongeth to the univer|sality of the first Cause to produce every Real Being, &amp;c.</HI> Hereupon I would aske him, which is the <HI>worst</HI> of the two, the saying of God, that he <HI>produceth the Devils hate|ing God,</HI> or that he is the <HI>Author</HI> of it?

<P>And yet again he affirmeth,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That in the hateing of God, the vital action of hatred is a thing positive, but the terminating of that act to such an object which is altogether lovely, that's the sinfulness of the action, and not positive, but privative, p.</HI> 95. <HI>l.</HI> 16, 17. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

The <HI>hateing of God</HI> is <HI>essentially evil,</HI> and yet <HI>it is</HI> (forsooth) <HI>from God.</HI> For it is an <HI>action,</HI> and so a <HI>positive thing, and all positive things</HI> (he also saith) <HI>are from God.</HI>

<P>This hath happen'd to him already, that the <HI>impiety</HI> of his <HI>Preface</HI> confute's his <HI>Book.</HI> For after so palpable a <HI>fal|sity,</HI> upon which he <HI>begins</HI> with Mr. <HI>Pierce,</HI> what honest man will ever <HI>heed</HI> him in what he <HI>add's</HI> of Mr. <HI>Busby?</HI> Nay if his <HI>passion</HI> and his <HI>Pet</HI> can so transport him out of <HI>Reason,</HI> as to make him inveigh in great measure against I know not what <HI>Calumnies, Incivilities,</HI> and <HI>Slanders,</HI> com|mitted against him by a person who never stood in his way, or beheld his face, or contributed in the least to his <HI>ejection</HI> out of the <HI>School,</HI> or ever printed any thing of him which he so sturdily pretends; what will he not say of his <HI>Master Busby,</HI> who accidentally hath <HI>hurt</HI> him, though he hath done him <HI>no wrong?</HI> Can he be carefull of the <HI>Truth</HI> whilst he is in his <HI>Paroxysme,</HI> who will not regard it in <HI>cooler Blood</HI>?

<P>I am a <HI>stranger</HI> to Mr. <HI>Busby</HI> as much as to <HI>Grotius</HI> in his Grave; and if Mr. <HI>Busby</HI> were in his Grave I would vindicate him further than now I shall. For though I think it a thing below me to <HI>slatter</HI> the greatest man <HI>alive,</HI>

<P>Whereas he saith of Mr. <HI>Calvin,</HI> and three more of his <HI>Followers departing from him,</HI> (as he doth often from <HI>him|self) that they lie under the same contempt and obloquy</HI>; I must needs affirm, he is prodigiously mistaken.

<P>But what can be possibly so absurd, which Mr. <HI>Bagshaw</HI>
<PB N="308" REF="167">
will not dare to put in <HI>print</HI> when he is <HI>Angry</HI>? He sayes <HI>I seem to be enamour'd upon my numerous issue,</HI> when yet his very <HI>Calumny</HI> implies his <HI>self-Contradiction.</HI> For he con|clude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me the <HI>Father</HI> of the severall <HI>Reflections o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Dis|course,</HI> although he <HI>knows</HI> I never <HI>own'd</HI> them.

I <HI>deny</HI> that <HI>sequel</HI>; and let him <HI>prove</HI> it if he is able.

<P>But I am probably to be blam'd, for taking notice (so much at <HI>large</HI>) of so lewd a writer. Whose inhumanity towards <HI>me,</HI> without the least <HI>shadow</HI> or <HI>shew</HI> of reason, (I having never provok'd him in <HI>any kind,</HI> unlesse it were by my peaceable and passive silence) as it hath <HI>antidoted</HI> the <HI>venome</HI> which he hath spit at Mr. <HI>Busby</HI>; so to be <HI>hated</HI> by such a person, <HI>with</HI> such a person as Mr. <HI>Busby,</HI> will (I doubt not) procure me his Readers <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>Having now done with Mr. <HI>Bagshaw,</HI> I bid him heartily <HI>Farewell.</HI> Nor do I say it as a complement, or <HI>word of Course</HI>; but as wishing him <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>change</HI> of <HI>Life.</HI> Of the <HI>other Oxonian</HI> I take <HI>no leave,</HI> as having given him no more then a <HI>Salutation,</HI> and as supposing he may de|serve a more elaborate <HI>entertainment.</HI> If Sir I have <HI>tyr'd</HI>
