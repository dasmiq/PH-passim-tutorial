<HEAD>To the Right Honourable, <HI>Charles</HI> Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> of <HI>Lanesborough,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with a great deal of Pleasure, that I lay hold on this first Occasion, which, the Accidents of my Life have given me of writing to your Lordship: For since at the same time I write to all the World, it will be a means of publishing, (what I would have every Body know) the Respect and Duty which I owe and pay to you. I have so much Inclination to be yours, that I need no other Engagement: But the particular Ties, by which I am bound to your Lordship and Family, have put it out of my power to make you any Complement; since all Offers of my self, will amount to no more than an honest Acknowledg|ment, and only shew a willingness in me to be grateful.</P>
<P>I am very near wishing, That it were not so much my Interest to be your Lordships Servant, that it might be more my Merit; not that I would avoid being obliged to you, but I would have my own Choice to run me into the Debt; that I might have it to boast, I had distinguished a Man, to whom I would be glad to be obliged, even without the hopes of having it in my Power, ever to make him a return.</P>
<P>It is impossible for me to come near your Lordship, in any kind, and not to receive some Favour; and while in appearance I am on|ly making an Acknowledgment (with the usual underhand deal|ing of the World) I am at the same time, insinuating my own Interest. I cannot give your Lordship your due, without tacking a Bill of my own Priviledges. 'Tis true, if a Man never commit|ted a Folly, he would never stand in need of a Protection: But then Power would have nothing to do, and good Nature no occa|sion to shew it self; and where those Vertues are, 'tis pity they should want Objects to shine upon. I must confess this is no rea|son, why a Man should do an idle thing, nor indeed any good Ex|cuse for it, when done; yet it reconciles the uses of such Autho|rity and Goodness, to the necessities of our Follies; and is a sort of Poetical Logick, which, at this time I would make use of, to argue your Lordship into a Protection of this Play. It is the first
<PB REF="3">
Offence I have committed in this kind, or indeed, in any kind of Poetry, tho' not the first made publick; and, therefore, I hope will the more easily be pardoned: But had it been Acted, when it was first written, more might have been said in its behalf; Ig|norance of the Town and Stage, would then, have been Excuses in a young Writer, which now, almost four Years experience, will scarce allow of. Yet I must declare my self sensible of the good Nature of the Town, in receiving this Play so kindly, with all its Faults, which I must own were, for the most part, very industriously covered by the care of the Players; for, I think, scarce a Cha|racter but receiv'd all the Advantage it would admit of, from the justness of Action.</P>
<P>As for the Criticks, my Lord, I have nothing to say, to, or against any of them of any kind; from those who make just Ex|ceptions, to those who find fault in the wrong place. I will only make this general Answer in behalf of my Play (an Answer, which <HI>Epictetus</HI> advises every Man to make for himself, to his Censurers) viz. <HI>That if they who find some Faults in it were as intimate with it as I am, they would find a great many more.</HI> This is a Confession, which I need not to have made; but however, I can draw this use from it, to my own Advantage, that I think there are no Faults in it, but what I do know; which, as I take it, is the first step to an amendment.</P>
<P>Thus I may live in hopes (sometime or other) of making the Town amends; but you, my Lord, I never can, tho' I am ever</P>

<L>WHEN Vertue in pursuit of Fame appears,</L>

<L>We timely court the rising Hero's Cause;</L>
<L>And on his side, the Poet wisely draws;</L>
<L>Bespeaking him hereafter, by Applause.</L>
<L>The days will come, when we shall all receive,</L>

<L>Such Nerves, such Graces, in your Lines appear,</L>
<L>As you were made to be her Ravisher.</L>
<L>DRYDEN has long extended his Command,</L>

<L>Heir to his Merit, be in Fame his Son.</L>
<L>What thou hast done, shews all is in thy Power;</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGVE intended for the old Btcahe|lour, sent to the Author, by an unknown Hand.</HEAD>
<L>MOST Authors on the Stage at first appear</L>
<L>Like Widows-Bridegrooms, full of doubt and fear:</L>
<L>They judge from the experience of the Dame,</L>
<L>How hard a Task it is to quench her Flame:</L>
<L>And who falls short of furnishing a course,</L>
<L>Up to his brawny Predecessors force;</L>
<L>With utmost rage from her Embraces thrown,</L>
<L>Remains convicted, as an empty Drone.</L>
<L>Thus often, to his Shame, a pert Beginner</L>
<L>Proves in the end, a miserable Sinner.</L>
<L>As for our Youngster, I am apt to doubt him,</L>
<L>With all the vigour of his Youth about him:</L>
<L>But he, more Sanguine, trusts in one and twenty,</L>
<L>And impudently hopes he shall content you:</L>
<L>For tho' his Batchelour be worn and cold:</L>
<L>He thinks the Young may club to help the Old:</L>
<L>And what alone can be atchieved by neither,</L>
<L>Is often brought about by both together.</L>
<L>The briskest of you all have felt Allarms,</L>
<L>Finding the fair One prostitute her Charms</L>
<L>With broken Sighs, in her old Fumblers Arms.</L>
<L>But for our Spark, he Swears he'll ne're be jealous</L>
<L>Of any Rivals, but young lusty Fellows.</L>
<L>Faith let him try his Chance, and if the Slave,</L>
<L>After his bragging, prove a washy Knave;</L>
<L>May he be banish'd to some lonely Den,</L>
<L>And never more have leave to dip his Pen:</L>
<L>But if he be the Champion he pretends,</L>
<L>Both Sexes sure will join to be his Friends;</L>
<L>For all agree, where all can have their ends.</L>
<L>And you must own him for a Man of Might,</L>

<L>HOW this vile World is chang'd! In former days,</L>
<L>Prologues, were serious Speeches, before Plays;</L>
<L>Grave solemn Things, as Graces are to Feasts;</L>
<L>Where, Poets beg'd a Blessing, from their Guests.</L>
<L>But now, no more like Suppliants, we come;</L>
<L>A Play makes War, and Prologue is the Drum:</L>
<L>Arm'd with keen Satyr, and with pointed Wit,</L>
<L>We threaten you who do for Iudges sit,</L>
<L>To save our Plays, or else we'll damn your Pit.</L>
<L>But for your Comfort, it falls out to day,</L>
<L>We've a young Author and his first born Play;</L>
<L>So, standing only on his good Behaviour,</L>
<L>He's very civil, and entreats your Favour.</L>
<L>Not but the Man has Malice, would he show it,</L>
<L>But on my Conscience he's a bashful Poet;</L>
<L>You think that strange&mdash;no matter, he'll out grow it.</L>
<L>Well, I'm his Advocate&mdash;by me he prays you,</L>
<L>(I don't know whether I shall speak to please you)</L>
<L>He prays&mdash;O bless me! what shall I do now!</L>
<L>Hang me if I know what he prays, or how!</L>
<L>And 'twas the prettiest Prologue, as he wrote it!</L>
<L>Well, the Deuce take me, if I hau'e forgot it.</L>
<L>O Lord, for Heavens sake excuse the Play,</L>
<L>Because, you know, if it be damn'd to day,</L>
<L>I shall be hang'd for wanting what to say.</L>
<L>How my sake then&mdash;but I'm in such Confusion,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Heartwell,</HI> that furly, old, pretended Woman-hater thinks her Vertuous; that's one reason why I fail her: I would have her fret her self out of conceit with me, that she may entertain some Thoughts of him. I know he visits her ev'ry day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet rails on still, and thinks his Love unknown to us; a little time will swell him so, he must be forc'd to give it birth, and the discovery must needs be very pleasant from himself, to see what pains he will take, and how he will strein to be deliver'd of a Secret, when he has miscarried on't already.</P>

<P>Why what a Cormorant in Love am I! who not contented with the slavery of honourable Love in one place, and the pleasure of enjoying some half a score Mistresses of my own acquiring; must yet take <HI>Vainlove</HI>'s Business upon my hands, because it lay too heavy upon his: So am not on|ly forc'd to lie with other Mens Wives for 'em, but must also undertake the harder Task, of obliging their Mistresses&mdash;I must take up, or I shall never hold out; Flesh and Blood cannot bear it always.</P>

<P>What, is <HI>Belinda</HI> cruel, that you are so thoughtful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith, not for that&mdash; But there's a Business of Consequence fall'n out to day that requires some Consideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee what mighty Business of Consequence canst thou have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you must know, 'tis a piece of Work toward the finishing of an Alderman; it seems I must put the last hand to it, and dub him Cuckold, that he may be of equal Dignity with the rest of his Brethren. So I must beg <HI>Belinda</HI>'s Pardon&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith e'en give her over for good-and-all; you can have no hopes of getting her for a Mistress, and she is too Proud, too Inconstant, too Affected and too Witty, and too handsome for a Wise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she can't have too much Mony&mdash;There's twelve thousand Pound <HI>Tom</HI>&mdash;'Tis true she is excessively foppish and affected, but in my Consci|ence I believe the Baggage loves me, for she never speaks well of me her self, nor suffers any Body else to rail at me. Then as I told you there's twelve thousand Pound&mdash;Hum&mdash;Why faith upon second Thoughts, she does not appear to be so very affected neither&mdash;Give her her due, I think the Woman's a Woman, and that's all. As such I'm sure I shall like her; for the Devil take me if I don't love all the Sex.</P>

company like a Physician, with discourse of their diseases and infirmities? What fine Lady hast thou been putting out of conceit with her self, and per|swading that the Face she had been making all the morning wos none of her own? for I know thou art as unmannerly and as unwelcome to a Woman, as a Looking-glass after the Small-pox.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I confess I have not been sneering fulsome Lies and nauseous Flattery, fawning upon a little tawdry Whore, that will fawn upon me again, and entertain any Puppy that comes; like a Tumbler with the same tricks over and over. For such I guess may have been your late employment.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith I don't know, he's of a temper the most easie to himself in the World; he takes as much always of an Amour as he cares for, and quits it when it grows stale, or unpleasant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>An argument of very little Passion, very good Understand|ing, and very ill Nature.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>You <HI>Bellmour</HI> are bound in gratitude to stickle for him; you with pleasure reap that fruit, which he takes pains to sow: he does the drudgery in the Mine, and you stamp your image on the Gold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's of another opinion, and says I do the drudgery in the Mine; well, we have each our share of sport, and each that which he likes best; 'tis his diversion to Set, 'tis mine to Cover the Partridge.</P>

<P>Good Mr. Young-fellow, your mistaken; as able as your self and as nimble too, though I mayn't have so much Mercury in my Limbs; 'tis true indeed, I don't force Appetite, but wait the natural call of my Lust, and think it time enough! to be lew'd, after I have had the temptation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Time enough, ay too soon, I should rather have expected, from a person of your gravity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Heart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet it is oftentimes too late with some of you young, ter|magant flashy sinners&mdash;you have all the guilt of the intention, and none of the pleasure of the practice&mdash;'tis true you are so eager in pursuit of the temptation, that you save the Devil the trouble of leading you into it: Nor is it out of discretion, that you don't swallow that very Hook your selves have baited, but you are cloy'd with the preparative, and what you mean for a Whet, turns the edge of your puny Stomacks. Your love is like your courage, which you shew for the first year or two upon all occasions; till in a little time, being disabled or disarm'd, you abate of your vigor; and that daring Blade which was so often drawn, is bound to the Peace for ever after.</P>

<P>I am for having every body be what they pretend to be; a Whoremaster be a Whoremaster; and not like <HI>Vainlove,</HI> kiss a Lap-Dog with passion, when it would disgust him from the Ladies own Lips.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>That only happens sometimes, where the Dog has the sweeter Breath, for the more cleanly conveyance. But <HI>George,</HI> you must not quar|rel with little Gallantries of this nature; Women are often won by 'em: who would refuse to kiss a Lap-Dog, if it were preliminary to the Lips of his Lady?</P>

<P>Or omit playing with her Fan; and cooling her if she were hot, when it might entitle him to the office of warming her when she should be cold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it to read a Play in a rainy day, when it may be the means of getting into a fair Ladies Books? Though you should be now and then interrupted in a witty Scene, and she perhaps preserve her Laughter, till the jest were over; even this may be born with, considering the reward in prospect.</P>

<P>I confess you that are Womens Asses bear greater burdens, are forced to undergo Dressing, Dancing, Singing, Sighing, Whining, Rhyming, Flattering, Lying, Grinning, Cringing, and the drudgery of loving to boot.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Brute, the drudgery of loving!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, why to come to Love through all these in cumbrances is like coming to an Estate overcharg'd with Debts, which by the time you have pay'd, yields no further profit than what the bare tillage and manur|ing of the Land will produce at the expence of your own Sweat.</P>
