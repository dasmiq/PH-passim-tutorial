Broker, or Draper; That you'l keep alwaies three strings to
your bow, to make it bend till it breake; That having gotten a Bub|ble
or Byshop, a lad of the last adoption, that you make him sensi|ble
of a Wench, though to the charge of a Surgeon, it being reason
all trades should live, and if occasion be, winke at small faults. Next
be sure to keep them continually at Game, or Drinking; Uurge 'em
to quarrell, and then take up the businesse, but not without profit to
the Brotherhood; That what quarrels soever arise among our selves,
must not cause us to fight with one another, but the Coines of the
Bubble or Byshop must make us friends; That you must not pay
your Coachman but with kicks, unlesse your Bubble or Byshop do,
and then he owes you a fare; That your Bubble, or Byshop, and you,
keep but one Purse, though two Drabs; That when you have drei|ned
him dry, you make him free, if he sue for it, if not let him keep
Company with the Titteretues, and live upon the sin of <HI>Sodom;</HI>
That you I take your chance of the day, where there is need of dip|ping,

<L>And now is fit for no place except Bedlam:</L>
<L>Here is another, a man you would think</L>
<STAGE>[to Anything</STAGE>
<L>The Devill could not worke upon, and yet</L>
<L>These Scotch ones have. The Lawyer, father of</L>
<L>Contrivances, is noos'd in one himselfe;</L>
<L>He cannot stand without his Crutches, and</L>
<L>His head's so light his nose is every minute</L>

<L>Your pitty; there's no double doores betwixt</L>
<L>His heart now, and your eyes; he's so transparent</L>
<L>You may see through him. Tis not these alone</L>

<L>When they had thus</L>
<L>Spread their infection, they begin to thinke</L>

<L>This man of Feather, as their grand Protector:</L>
<L>They take him, and to Covenant they go;</L>
