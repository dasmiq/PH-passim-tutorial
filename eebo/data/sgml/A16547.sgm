all things, it is our dutie to come vnto him for euery thing:
and as he hath right to all, so power to dispose of all: and
therefore we cannot doe any thing we desire, but by power
receiued of him. And if his be power and kingdome, then

<P>THe <HI>Benedictus, Magnificat,</HI> and <HI>Nunc dimittis,</HI> are said
in the Church daily, whereas other Psalmes of <HI>Dauid,
Asaph, Moses,</HI> are read but monethly. The reasons hereof
are manifest, and manifold; I will onely name two:</P>
<P>First, these most excellent Hymnes (as<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Hooker Eccle|siast. pelit. lib. 5. &sect; 40.</NOTE> gratulations
wherewith our Lord and Sauiour was ioifully receiued at
his entrance into the world) concerne vs so much more then
the Psalmes of <HI>Dauid,</HI> as the Gospell more then the Law,
and the new Testament more then the old. For the one are
but prophecies of Christ to come, whereas the other are
plaine discoueries of Christ already present.</P>
<P>Secondly, these songs are proper onely to <HI>Christianitie,</HI>
whereas other Psalmes are common to the <HI>Iewes,</HI> as well as
to the <HI>Christians,</HI> wherewith they praise God in their <HI>Syna|gogue,</HI>
so well as we praise God in our Church. A Iew will
sing with <HI>Asaph</HI> and <HI>Dauid</HI> that the <HI>Messias</HI> of the world
shall come, but he cannot, he will not acknowledge with
<HI>Zacharias</HI> and <HI>Simeon</HI> that he is come. So that the <HI>Nouelist</HI>
herein misliking the Churches custome, doth seeme to play
the Iew; which I rather ascribe to the lightnes of his folly,
then to the waight of his malice. <HI>Sententiam Ecclesiae non in|telligit,

<P>It is <HI>fitly placed after the second Lesson,</HI> as an Hymne of

<P>It is very remarkable, that <HI>Zacharias</HI> who was dumbe,

is especially manifested in the Law, the Godhead of the

so much in foure words as the whole Bible con|taines

is<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Acts 5. 3. 4.</NOTE> God, otherwise we might not beleeue in him. Second|ly,
that hee is a<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Matth. 28. 19.</NOTE> distinct person from the Father, and the

is holie, the Sonne holie, the Father a Spirit, and the

beside the holinesse of nature, his speciall office is to
make the Church holy. The Father sanctifieth by the Sonne
and by the holy Ghost: the Sonne sanctifieth from the Fa|ther

the Father and the Sonne by himselfe immediatly. As wee
beleeue that the Father is our Creator, the Sonne our Re|deemer;

<P>Againe, the third person is termed <HI>the Spirit,</HI> not onely in

<HI>spired,</HI> or <HI>breathed</HI> from the Father and the Sonne: in that he
proceeds from them both. How, I cannot say, you need not

not accord them with my tongue, but only record them in
my heart. It is truly said, he loues but little, who tels how
much he loues: and so surely hee praiseth God but little,
who makes it a tongue-toile and a lip-labor only. Mark. 7. 6.
<HI>This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is farre

the hand, come, and it commeth; vnto the rest, doe this, and

the better part, so this <HI>Mary</HI> bestowed vpon God her best
part, <HI>her soule did magnifie, her spirit reioyced.</HI></P>
<P>Some Diuines expound these words ioyntly, some seue|rally.
The word spirit is vsed in the holie Scripture some|time
for the whole soule. 1. Cor. 7. 34. The woman vnma|ried
<PB N="53" REF="30">
careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy
both in body and in spirit, that is,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ambros. com. in loc.</NOTE> in soule.</P>
<P>So S. <HI>Augustine</HI> thinks that these two words here signifie
the same, because the latter phrase, <HI>my spirit reioiceth in God
my Sauiour,</HI> is nothing else but an exegesis of the former, <HI>my
soule doth magnifie the Lord:</HI> insinuating by this repetition,
<HI>my soule, my spirit,</HI> that her deuotion was not hypocriticall,
but cordiall and vnfained. It is obserued in nature, that the
Fox doth nip the necke, the Mastiue the throat, the Ferret
the liuer, but God especially careth for the heart: being (as
<HI>Ambrose</HI> speakes excellently) <HI>Non corticis, sed cordis deus.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore <HI>Mary</HI> was not content to praise the Lord
from the rine of her lips only, but also from the roote of her
heart. So<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Psal. 103. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Dauid</HI> did pray, <HI>Praise the Lord O my soule, and
all that is within mee praise his holy name.</HI> So<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Coless. 3. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> would
haue vs pray: <HI>Sing to the Lord with a grace in your hearts.</HI>
And so the Church doth desire that the Priest (who is the
mouth of the people) should pray, <HI>The Lord be with you,</HI> saith
the Minister, and the whole congregation answereth, <HI>And
with thy spirit.</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Caroliu mag|nus fragment. de ritibus eccl. veteris, Cassan|der Liturgica, cap. 21.</NOTE> Heereby signifying, that this holy busi|nesse
ought to be performed with all attention and inten|tion
of spirit.</P>
<P>Diuines interpreting these two seuerally, distinguish be|tweene
<HI>soule</HI> and <HI>spirit:</HI> and so doth the Scripture, 1. <HI>Cor.
15. 45. The first man Adam was made a liuing soule; the last
Adam a quickening spirit.</HI> Soule is that by which we liue na|turally:
spirit is that, by which we liue through grace super|naturally.
Or (<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Calu. in loc.</NOTE> as other) soule signifieth the will, and spirit
the vnderstanding: as Heb. 4. 12. <HI>The word of God is liuely and
mighty in operation, and sharper then any two edged sword, and
entreth thorow, euen vnto the diuiding asunder of the soule and
spirit:</HI> that is,<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Beza in loc.</NOTE> of the will and vnderstanding.</P>
<P>So that <HI>Mary</HI> saying here, my soule and my spirit, doth
intimate that she did praise the Lord with attention in her
vnderstanding, and deuotion in her affection. They praise
God with halfe an heart, who either hauing deuotion,
want vnderstanding: or else indued with vnderstanding,
want deuotion: and so while men pray with the soule with|out
<PB N="54" REF="31">
a spirit, or with the spirit, without a soule, their heart is
diuided (as the Prophet<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Ose 10. cap. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Ose: Diuisum est cor eorum:</HI>) and
God hath but one part, happily the least peece.</P>
<P>The line then to be drawne from this example is, first that
we pray with our heart: secondly, with our whole heart,
with all our soule, with all our spirit.</P>

therefore if we desire to reioice in spirit, let vs not behold
God in the glasse of the Law, which makes him a dreadfull
Iudge: but in the glasse of the Gospell, which shewes him a
mercifull Sauiour.</P>
<P>In euery Christian there are two contrary natures; the
flesh, and the spirit: and that hee may bee a perfit man in
Christ, he must subdue the one, and strengthen the other:
the Law is the ministry of death, and serueth fitly for the
taming of our rebellious flesh: the Gospell is the power of
God vnto life, containing the bountifull promises of God
in Christ, and serueth fitly for the strengthening of the
spirit. It is<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Luke 10 34. The Law as wine to search, the Gospell as oyle to supple.</NOTE> oyle to powre into our wounds, and water of

serueth the world. It is a base seruice to serue the world:
for that is to become a vassall vnto our seruant. It is an vn|certaine
seruice to serue the flesh: this master is so chole|ricke,
so weake, so sickly, so fickle, that we may looke euery
day to be turned out of his doores: and that which is worst
of all, he is least contented, when he is most satisfied. Like to

<P>I know many men haue died discontent and rauing,

imagination, and yet notwithstanding were doubtlesse
Gods elect children. For, as<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">De doctrina Christiana, lib. 1. cap. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine,</HI> many works of
God concerning our saluation are done in, and by their
contraries. In the creation, all things were made, not of
something, but of nothing, cleane contrary to the course of
nature. In the worke of redemption, he doth giue life, not
by life, but by death, and that a most accursed death. <HI>Opti|mum

foolishnes, in reason more likely to driue men from God,
then to winne and wooe men to God. And when it is his
pleasure that any should depend vpon his goodnesse and
prouidence, he makes them feele his anger, and to be no|thing
in themselues, that they may relie altogether vpon
him. And thus happily the child of God, through<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Acts. 14. 22.</NOTE> many
tribulations, and, to our thinking, through the gulfe of de|speration,
enters into the kingdome of heauen. The loue of

secret presence sustaines vs in all our troubles and tempta|tations:
it intertaineth life in our soules, whe~ as to our iudg|ment
we are altogether dead, as there is life in trees when
they haue cast their leaues. And therefore let no man bee
dismaied, howsoeuer dismaied: for God doth neuer leaue
those, whom he doth loue: but his comfortable spirit is a
secret friend, and often doth vs most good, when wee least
perceiue it: Esay 41. 10 &amp;c. 43. 2.</P>
<P><HI>According to thy word.</HI>]<NOTE PLACE="marg">According to thy word.</NOTE>] If God promise, we may presume,

as deare children. As he doth euer keepe his word with vs;
so let vs euer keepe our othes and promises one with ano|ther.
It is well obserued, that <HI>aequinocation and lying is a kind
of vnchastitie:</HI> for the mouth and minde are coupled toge|ther
in holie mariage: Matth. 12. 34. <HI>Out of the abundance
of the heart the mouth speaketh.</HI> And therefore when the

our speech is conceiued in adulterie, and hee that breedes

such bastard children, offends not only against charity, but
also against chastitie.</P>
<P><HI>Men say they must lie sometime for aduantage, but it is

<P><HI>For mine eyes haue seene thy saluation</HI>] I haue seene the

and brought vnto vs. As <HI>Simeon</HI> saw Christs humanitie
with the eies of his body: so he saw Christs Diuinity long
before with the pearcing eies of faith. He knew that the
little babe which he lulled in his armes, was the great God,
whom the heauen of heauens could not containe: and
therefore beleeuing in the Lord of life, hee was not afraid
of death: but instantly breakes forth into this sweete song,
<HI>Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace, for mine eyes
haue</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Death is vnwelcome to carnall men, as<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Arist. Ethic. lib. 3. cap. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Aristotle</HI> said,
<HI>Of all Terribles the most Terrible.</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Philip Mor|ney Treat. of life and death.</NOTE> They crie out vpon the
miseries of life, and yet when death commeth, they doe as
little children, who all the day complaine, but when the
medicine is brought them, are nothing sicke: as they who
all the weeke runne vp and downe the house with paine of
the teeth, and seeing the Barbor come to pull them out,
feele no more torment: as tender bodies in a pricking plu|risie
call, and cannot stay for a Surgeon, and yet when they
see him whetting his lancet to cut the throte of the disease,
pull in their armes and hide them in the bed. And the true
reason hereof is want of faith, because they doe not vnfai|nedly
beleeue that Christ Iesus<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 4 8.</NOTE> <HI>hath led captiuitie captiue,
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 54.</NOTE> that he hath swallowed vp death in victorie by his death, and

the Father.</HI> Here <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">meon</HI> departed ioyfully, because <HI>his eyes
saw the saluation of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>As there are two degrees of faith, so two sorts of Chri|stians;
one weake, another strong. The weake Christian is
willing to liue, and patient to die: but the strong patient to
liue, and willing to die.</P>
<P>That a man may depart in peace, two things are requisit:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Preparation before death.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A right disposition at death.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Both which are procured onely by faith in Christ. If a
man were to fight hand to hand with a mightie Dragon, in
such wise that either he must kill or be killed, his best course
were to bereaue him of his poison and sting. Death is a Ser|pent,
and the sting, wherewith he woundeth vs, is sinne: so
saith<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 56.</NOTE> S. <HI>Paul, The sting of death is sinne.</HI> Now the true be|leeuer
vnderstands and knowes assuredly that Christ Iesus
hath satisfied the law, and then if no law, no sinne: and if no
sinne, death hath no sting: well may death hisse, but it can|not
hurt:<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Psal. 32. 1.</NOTE> when our vnrighteousnes is forgiuen, and sinne
couered, Christ both in life and death is aduantage: Phi|lip. 1. 21.</P>
<P>Faith also procureth a right disposition and behauiour at
death: for euen as when the children of Israel in the wil|dernes
were stung with fierie Serpents, and lay at the point
of death,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Numb. 21. 9.</NOTE> they looked vp to the <HI>Brasen Serpent,</HI> erected by
<HI>Moses</HI> according to Gods appointment, and were present|ly
cured: so when any feele death draw neere with his fiery
sting, to pearce the heart, they must fixe the eye of a true
faith vpon Christ exalted on the Crosse, beholding death
not in the glasse of the Law, which giueth death an vglie
face: but in the Gospels glasse, setting foorth death, not as
death, but as a<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11. 30.</NOTE> sleepe only. Faith is the speare which kil|leth
our last enemie: for when a man is sure that <HI>his<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Iob 19. 25.</NOTE> re|deemer
liueth, and that this<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 54.</NOTE> corruptible shall put on incorrup|tion,
and this mortall immortalitie;</HI> well may he sing with old
<PB N="74" REF="41">
<HI>Simeon, Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace:</HI> and
triumph ouer y^e graue with <HI>Paul; O death where is thy sting!

of sin is the law: but thanks be giuen vnto God, which giueth vs
victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> And thus much of the
reason, why <HI>Simeon</HI> was not afraid of death: namely, for that
he did hold in his armes, and behold with his eyes, the Lord

<P><HI>Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.</HI>] The

our Sauiour brought to the whole world.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Wherein two points are
to be noted especially:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What are his benefits.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To whom they belong.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The benefits are <HI>saluation, light,</HI> and <HI>glorie.</HI> So that the
world without Christ, lieth in damnation, darknesse, and
shame. <HI>Iesus</HI> is a Sauiour,<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Acts 4. 12.</NOTE> neither is there saluation in any
other: he is <HI>the<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Iohn 1. 9. &amp; 8. 12.</NOTE> light of the world,</HI> and <HI>sunne of righteousnes,</HI>
without whom all men <HI>sit in darknesse, and in the shadow of
death,</HI> as <HI>Zacharias</HI> in his song: hee is our glorie, without
whom <HI>nothing belongs vnto vs but<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Baruch. 1. 15.</NOTE> confusion and shame.</HI>
These benefits are so great, that they ought to bee had in a
<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Psal. 111. 4.</NOTE> perpetuall remembrance. Christ himselfe commanded his
last supper to be reiterated often, and the Church inioyneth
this Hymne to bee sung dailie, in a thankfull memoriall
hereof.</P>
<P>But vnto whom appertaine these benefits? Vnto all. So
saith the text, <HI>which thou hast prepared before the face of all
people.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Esay. 52. 10.</NOTE> The Lord hath made bare his holie arme in the sight of
all the Gentiles, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salua|tion
of our God. Christ</HI> is set vp as a<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Esay 11. 10.</NOTE> signe to the people, and
happily for this cause, among other, hee was borne in a
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Luke 2. 7.</NOTE> common Inne, frequented by men of all sorts: and the
first newes of the Gospell was preached in open fields,
Luk. 2. <HI>as prepared before the face of all people.</HI></P>
<P>But here we must obserue, that albeit saluation pertaines
<PB N="75" REF="41">
to all, yet all pertaine not to it: none pertaine to it, but such
as take benefit by it: and none take benefit by it, no more
then by the brasen Serpent, but they who fix their eies on it.
If we desire saluation, light, and glory, we must (as <HI>old Si|meon</HI>)
imbrace Christ ioyiully, and hold him in our armes of
faith stedfastly.</P>
<P><HI>To be a light to lighten the Gentiles.</HI>] If any shall demand
why <HI>Simeon</HI> here calles Christ the light of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and
glory of the <HI>Iewes,</HI> rather then the glory of <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and
light of the <HI>Iewes:</HI> answer is made
that there is a two-fold darknes:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Sinne.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ignorance.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Sinne is called in holy Scriptures a worke of darknes for
diuers respects:</P>
<P>1. Because it is committed against God,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1. Epist. Iohn 1. 5.</NOTE> <HI>who is light,</HI>
through the suggestion of Satan,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 6. 12.</NOTE> <HI>who is the prince of dark|nesse.</HI></P>
<P>2. Because sinne for the most part is committed in the
darke:<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1. Thes. 5. 7.</NOTE> <HI>They that sleepe, sleepe in the night, and they that are
drunken, are drunken in the night.</HI></P>
<P>3. Because sinne deserueth eternall darknesse:<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Matth. 25. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Cast that
vnprofitable seruant into vtter darknes.</HI></P>
<P>4. Because sinne is committed especially through the
darknesse of vnderstanding: for Satan vsually blindeth our
eies of reason, and religion, and makes sinne appeare not in
it owne name and nature, but vnder the name and habit of
vertue.</P>
<P>Now in regard of this kind of darknes, Christ was a light
to the Iewes, as well as to the Gentiles: Esay 60. 1. <HI>Arise O
Ierusalem, be bright, for thy light is come.</HI> Iohn 1. 9. <HI>Christ doth
lighten euery man that commeth into the world.</HI></P>
<P>The second kind of darknesse is ignorance: the light of
the body is the eye, so the eye of the soule is the vnderstan|ding:
and therefore as Christ saith, if the light that is in thee
be darknes, how great is that darknes? The Iewes in this re|spect
were not in such darknesse as the Gentiles; hauing the
Law, the Prophets, the sacrifices and exercises of holy reli|gion:
<HI>In Iurie was God knowne, his name great in Israel, at Sa|lem
was his Tabernacle, his dwelling in Sion:</HI> whereas the
<PB N="76" REF="42" MS="y">
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 2. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Gentiles were strangers and aliens from the couenants of pro|mise,
without hope, without God in the world:</HI> but now Christ
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Esay 42. 6.</NOTE> the light of the Gentiles, yea of the whole world, hath
broken downe the partition wall, and made of<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 2. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Both, one;</HI>
all people, Gods people. For as the<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Matth. 5. 45.</NOTE> naturall Sunne shineth
indifferently vpon the good and euill: so the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Mal. 4. 2.</NOTE> Sunne of
righteousnes sheweth his glorious sauing light before the
face of all people; to lighten and open our eies, that we may
turne from darknesse to light, from the power of Satan vnto
God: Acts 26. 18.</P>
<P>Howsoeuer Christ be the light of all people, yet (as it fol|loweth)
he is <HI>The glory of his people Israel, vnto whom pertai|ned
the<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Rom. 9. 4.</NOTE> adoption, and the glory, and the couenants.</HI> He was
promised vnto them, borne of them, bred vp them, he
liued, preached, acted his great wonders among them: in all
which respects, he may be fitly called <HI>Israels glory.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we may learne, first, that the Gospel is the greatest
honour of a State.</P>
<P>Secondly, that all our glory depends on Christ our head,
who is the King of glory.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, that a good man, especially a good Preacher, is

</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The matter is: <HI>these words,</HI> that is, these sentences and all
these: for Almightie God spake not the first Commande|ment
only, nor the second, or third, and left there; but hee
spake them all: and therefore the Pope proues himselfe <HI>An|tigod</HI>
in leauing out one, and dispensing with many. God
gaue so strict a charge to keepe euery one, as any one: but
the Vicar of God abounding with vnlimitted authoritie,
doth first publish what he list, and then expound them as he
list. To leaue them, who thus leaue God, is our dutie, be|cause
God spake them all, to beg of him obedience, and
<PB N="85" REF="46">
make conscience to keepe them all, as one wittily, <HI>Totus,
Tota, Totum:</HI> The whole man, The whole law, The whole
time of his life.</P>
<P>In the manner, I note first the circumstance of time, when
God spake: namely, <HI>when all the people were gathered together,
aud sanctified:</HI> as appeareth in the former Chapter, <HI>then God
spake.</HI> Whereupon it is well obserued that all men ought to
take notice of the law, whether they be Commoners, or
Commanders, high or low, none so mighty that is greater,
or so meane that is lesse, then a subiect to God and his ordi|nances:
and therefore<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Loc. com. tit. Antinomoi.</NOTE> <HI>Martin Luther</HI> hath worthily repre|hended
<HI>Antinomian</HI> preachers, who teach that the Law need
not be taught in the time of the Gospell. Indeed <HI>Christ is

to teach it, and doe it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, we may learne by this circumstance, due pre|paration
when wee come before God either to speake or
heare his word. <HI>Auenzoar</HI> vsed to say, that hee neuer gaue
purgation, but his heart did shake many daies before. Let
the Physition of the soule then tremble, to thinke what
hurt bad physicke may doe, when it is administred abrupt|ly,
corruptly, without either paines in reading, or reuerence
in speaking. Vnto the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Psal. 50. 16.</NOTE> vngodly said God; <HI>Why doest thou
preach my lawes, and takest my couenant in thy mouth, when as
thou hatest to be reformed, and hast cast my words behind thee?</HI>
If hearers of the Law, much more Preachers of the Gospell
ought to be throughly sanctified. In the Millers hand wee
lose but our meale: in the Farriors hand but our mule: in
the Lawyers hands but our goods: in the Physitians hand
but our life; but in the hands of a bad Diuine wee may lose
that which surpasseth all, our soule.</P>
<P>Hearers also being of vncircumcised<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Acts 7. 51.</NOTE> hearts and eares,
ought to fit and prepare themselues, as<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Exod. 3. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Moses</HI> and<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Iosua 5. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Iosua</HI>
were commanded, in disburdening their mind, when they
come to Gods house to heare God speake, not only from
vnlawfull, but also from all lawfull worldly busines; pre|senting
<PB N="86" REF="47" MS="y">
themselues and their soules in the righteousnes of
Christ, a<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 1.</NOTE> liuing, holy, acceptable sacrifice to God: and it
is the dutie both of speaker and hearer to desire the Lord
that he would forgiue our<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Chron. 2. 30. 18. 19.</NOTE> want of preparation, and so to
assist vs with his holy spirit in handling of his holy word, as
that the whole businesse may be transacted for our good,
and his glory.</P>
<P>The second circumstance noted in the manner is the per|son,
and that is God: <HI>Then God spake these words,</HI> in his owne
person, attended vpon with millions of<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Acts 7. 53. Gal. 3. 9.</NOTE> glorious Angels,
in<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Exod. 19. 18.</NOTE> a flame of fire: so that there is neuer an idle word, but
all full of wonderful wisdome: so perfect a law, that it proues
it selfe to be Gods law. For the lawes of men, albeit they fill
many large volumes, are imperfect; some statutes are added
daily which were not thought vpon before; many repea|led,
which after experience taught not to be so profitable:
but this law continueth the same for euer, comprehending
in a few words all perfection of dutie to God and man, in|ioyning
whatsoeuer is good, and forbidding whatsoeuer
is euill.</P>
<P>God is author of all holy Scripture, but the ten Com|mandements
are his, after a more peculiar sort: first, because
himselfe spake them, and said in a sound of words, and a di|stinct
voice,<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Deut. 5. 24.</NOTE> that the people both heard, and vnderstood
them: in which s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nse S.<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Acts 7. 38.</NOTE> <HI>Stephen</HI> happily calleth them <HI>ora|cula
vina,</HI> liuely oracles: not that they did giue life, for<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 3. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI>
sheweth that the Law was the ministration of death; but
liuely words, as vttered by liuely voice, not of men or An|gels,
as other Scripture, but immediatly thundred out by
God himselfe.</P>
<P>Secondly, because God himselfe wrote them after a more
speciall maner: hee did vse men, and meanes in penning
the Gospels and Epistles and other parts of sacred writ:
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 1. 21.</NOTE> <HI>for holy men of God wrote as they were moued by the spirit of
God:</HI> (as the<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Theodoret praefat in Psal. &amp; Greg. praefat. in Iob.</NOTE> Fathers obserue) they were the pennes of
Gods owne finger: but in setting downe the Decalogue,
Gods owne finger was the pen: hee made the tables also
wherein they were first written, that there might be no|thing
<PB N="87" REF="47">
in them but only Gods immediate worke. Since then
God had such speciall regard in deliuering the Law, wee
must hence learne with all humble reuerence to receiue the
same. If King <HI>Eglon</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Iudges 3. 20.</NOTE> a barbarous tyrant respected <HI>Ehud</HI> a
man of meane qualitie, when he brought a message from
the Lord; how much more should we with awfull respect
embrace the Decalogue, which God in his owne person vt|tered?
and it should make vs exceeding zealous also (not|withstanding
the scoffes of <HI>Atheists</HI> and carelesse <HI>world|lings</HI>)
in obseruing and maintaining the same. For what
need any feare to defend that which God himselfe spake:
and whereof<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Mark. 8. 38.</NOTE> Christ said, <HI>He that is ashamed of me, and my
words in this world, I will be ashamed of him before my father in
the world to come.</HI> As a liuely faith is the best glosse vpon
the Gospell: so dutifull obedience is the best Commen|tarie
vpon the Law. To conclude with <HI>Augustine: Faciemus

<P>Thus much concerning the first preface. The second is of
the Law-giuer: <HI>I am the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. Containing two sorts of
arguments, to proue that hee may giue a law; and that his
people are bound to keepe it. The first kind of reason is ta|ken
from his essence and greatnes in himselfe: <HI>I am Iehoua.</HI>

especially those three sins of the tongue:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Contumely.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Detractation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cursing.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>A contumely is an iniurious word, spoken with an iniu|rious
mind, to the dishonour of our neighbour: I say with
an iniurious intent; otherwise when it is vttered by way
of aduice to direct or correct, as a father sometime spea|keth
to his childe, or a master to his scholler, or a Pastor to
his people, as <HI>Paul:<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 1.</NOTE> Ye foolish Galathians:</HI> out of some heat,
but yet not out of any hate, then it is no contumelie or
sinne.</P>
<P>Or in merriment, not in malice: <HI>There is a time to<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Eccles. 3. 4.</NOTE> laugh:</HI>
and so by consequence a time to iest: when a wittie con|ceit
may profit and administer grace to the hearer. He that
said the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> was the greatest vsurer in France, be|cause
he turned all his estate into obligations, hereby gaue
this honest aduice, that if he should leaue himselfe nothing,
but only haue many followers bound to him for his large
gifts, in conclusion he should finde a number of bad deb|tors.
He that called his friend theefe, because he had stollen
away his loue, did not wrong, but commend him.</P>
<P>It is lawfull also to iest at the vanities of irreligious men,
enemies to God and his Gospell: as<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1. King. 18. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Elia</HI> did at the soppish
idolatry of <HI>Baals</HI> Priests. A friend of mine said of an vpstart
gallant in Court with a gingling spur, that he had a Church
on his backe, and the bels on his heeles.</P>
<P>Euery lay Papist must beleeue as the Church beleeues,
albeit he know not what the Church beleeueth: he must
also worship the consecrated bread, and yet knoweth not
<PB N="105" REF="56">
whether it be consecrated or no:<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. Trident, sess. 7. can 11. Bellarm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n. de sacramentis in genere, cap. 17.</NOTE> <HI>for to the consecration of
the host, the Priests intention is required,</HI> which no ma~ knowes
but God, and himselfe. So that if a man tell his popish ac|quaintance
that he is a blinde buffe, to worship and beleeue
he knowes not what, it were no contumelie; because it did
proceed out of zeale to God, and loue to him; only to recti|fie
his error, and not to vilifie his person.</P>
<P>The second fault reduced to false witnes is detractation,
in speaking euill of our neighbour: and it is done by repor|ting
that which is false, and sometime by telling that which
is true, but secret: whereby the credit of our neighbour is
lessened with those, to whom his sinne was not knowne be|fore:
for as a man may flatter in absence, namely, when ei|ther
the vertue is absent, or the occasion, and so the praise is
not kinde but forced either in truth, or in time: so likewise
a man may slander his neighbour in speaking the truth vn|seasonably,
without discretion out of time and place. A tale
tossed from mouth to mouth in creaseth as a snowbal, which
being little at the first, groweth to a great quantitie.</P>
<P>Now the backbiter is bound in reason and religion to
restore the good name of his neighbour, which hee by de|traction hath taken away; and that is exceeding hard: for
a mans honest fame is like the <HI>Merchants wealth got in ma|ny
yeeres, and lost in an houre.</HI> Wherefore speake well of all
men alwaies, if it may bee done with truth: and when it
cannot, then bee silent: or else interrupt euill detractation
with other meere and merrie communication, as<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Iudges 14. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Sampson</HI>

<HEAD>The 10. Commandement.</HEAD>
<P>THe former precepts intend thoughts and desires, aswel
as act and practise: for the Lawgiuer is a spirit, and
therefore must be worshipped in spirit: yet lest wee should
pretend ignorance, God in this Commandement giueth
especiall order for them. Or as<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Melancthon, &amp; Caluin. Cat.</NOTE> other: The former pre|cepts
did condemne the setled thought to doe mischiefe:
but this euen the first inclination and motion to sinne,
though a man neuer consent, but snub it in the beginning:
Rom. 7. 7. <HI>Thou shalt not lust or desire.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Now we sin
three waies in
this kinde:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By coueting
y^e goods of our
neighbour,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Immoueable:</HI> as his land
and house.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Moueable:</HI> as his oxe
and asse, &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By coueting his wife.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By plotting treason, and murther.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To couet his goods is against his profit, which is deare
to him: to couet his wife is against his honor, which ought
to bee more deare: to couet his bloud is against his life,
which of all wordly things is most deare.</P>
<P>Whereas it is obiected that desire of murther is not for|bidden
in particular, as the desire of theft and adulterie: for
the Commandement saith, <HI>Thou shalt not couet thy neigh|bours
house, thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife:</HI> but it is
not said, <HI>Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours bloud:</HI> Answere
is made, that a man doth not desire any thing principallie
but that which bringeth him some<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. Ethic. lib. 1. cap. 1.</NOTE> good, at least in appea|rance.
And so he desireth adulterie, because it bringeth de|light:
hee desireth theft for that it bringeth profit: but
<PB N="107" REF="57">
murther bringeth no good at all: and therefore it is not de|sired
for it selfe, but only to attaine to theft, or adultery, or
some such designement.</P>
<P>So that God hauinge~ forbidd expresly the disordinate de|sires
of delectation and gaine, comequently forbad desires
of murther, which is not coueted b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t for vnlawfull profit or
pleasure. Thus perfect righteousnesse is fulfilled when we
wrong not our neighbour either in deed, or in word, or de|sire:
but contrariwise, doe good vnto all, speake well, and
thinke charitably of all.</P>
<P><HI>Now the reason why the Church appoints the Decalogue to
be read at the Communion,</HI> is euident: namely, because <HI>the
law is a<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 24.</NOTE> schoolemaster vnto Christ;</HI> teaching vs to<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Rom. 3. 20.</NOTE> know
sinne, and by knowing of sinne to know our selues, and
knowing our selues to renounce our selues, as of our selues
vnable to doe any<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Iohn 16. 5.</NOTE> thing, and so come to Christ: who doth
strengthen vs to doe all<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Phil. 4. 13.</NOTE> things. Almighty God (saith<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Tom. 1. fol. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Lu|ther</HI>)
hath written his law not so much to forbid offences
to come, as to make men acknowledge their sinnes already
past, and now present: that behol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing themselues in the
lawes glasse, they may discerne their owne imperfections,
and so flie to Christ: who hath fulfilled the law, and taken
away the sinnes of the whole world. For (as the<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Com. Prayer bookes, tit. Lords Supper.</NOTE> reformed
Churches of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Geneua</HI> speake) the end of our
comming to the Lords table, is not to make protestation
that wee are iust, and vpright in our liues: but contrariwise
we come to seeke our life and perfection in Iesus Christ: be|ing
assuredly perswaded that the Lord requireth on our
part no other worthinesse, but vnfainedly to confesse our
vnworthinesse. So that (our enemies being Iudges) it is well
ordered that the Commandements are rehearsed in the mi|nistration
of this holy Sacrament. Let the <HI>Nouelists</HI> here
blush, who<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">For it is inser|ted elsewhere both in the com|mon Catechis. and in the BB. Bible: Exodus 20. 1. Deut. 5. 6.</NOTE> calumniously censure our Church for omit|ting

<P>THe Lords Supper is called a sacrifice by the learned an|cient
Doctors in foure respects:</P>
<P>First, because it is a representation &amp; memoriall of Christs

<P>Secondly, because in this action we offer praise &amp; thanks|giuing
vnto God, for the redemption of the world: and this
is the sacrifice of our lips: Heb. 13. 15.</P>
<P>Thirdly, because euery Communicant doth offer and
present himselfe body and soule, a liuing, holy, acceptable
sacrifice to the Lord: Rom. 12. 1. The which excels the sa|crifices
of the Priests in old time: for they did offer dead
sacrifices, but we present our selues a<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">1. Collect after the receiuing of the bread and wine.</NOTE> liuely sacrifice to
God.</P>
<P>Fourthly, because it was a<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Iustin Martyr Apolog. 2.</NOTE> custome in the Primitiue
Church at the receiuing of this blessed Sacrament to giue
large contribution vnto the poore, a sacrifice well accepted
of God: Heb. 13. 16. Now the Church allowing and fol|lowing
this good old custome, stirres vp the people to giue
cheerfully by repeating some one or two choice sentences

Christ ordained in his Church onely two Sacraments, as
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Com. Catechis.</NOTE> generally necessarie to saluation, that is to say, Baptisme,

For this cause the sacred Font is placed at the very doore

of confirmation, to strengthen our faith, and che|rish
grace receiued: and therefore the Lords table by good
order is placed in the best &amp; highest roome of the Church.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Hauing thus examined examination, I come now to
the participation.</P>
<P><HI>And so let him eate,</HI> &amp;c.] Of which words I purpose to
speake first ioyntly, then seuerally. Considered ioyntly they
confute three popish conclusions: as first, the reseruation,
eleuation, circumgestation, adoration of the bread. Our
Apostle saith here plainly, that the bread must be taken and
eaten:<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Confess. Ang|litan, art 28.</NOTE> <HI>Ergo,</HI> not to be reserued, nor carried about, not lif|ted
vp, nor kept in a box to be worshipped.</P>
<P>Secondly, to take to eate, to taste, to drinke, to doe this
in remembrance of Christ, are actions of the liuing, only
pertaining to the liuing: and therefore the Papists are de|ceiued
holding the Masse to bee a propitiatorie sacrifice
both for the quick and the dead. How can the dead eate or
drinke, taste or take?<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Melancthon in confess. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">c|cle. Saxon. Tom. 1. fol. 135.</NOTE> <HI>Ergo,</HI> neither the dutie nor the be|nefit
belongs vnto them, but only to those aliue; who first
examine themselues, and after eate of this bread and drinke
of this cup.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the coniunction of these two: <HI>Let him eate of
this bread, and drink of this cup</HI> abundantly proues, that both
parts of the Lords Supper ought to be ministred vnto all:
<HI>Ergo&punc;</HI> the Papists in denying the cup vnto the Laitie, wrong
both God and his people, by defrauding them of this com|fort.
As euery one must examine, so euerie one both eate
and drinke: not onely drinke, and not eate, or eate and not
drinke: but both eate, and drinke. Christ foreseeing this
Papisticall error said in his first institution, <HI>Drinke ye<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Matth. 26. 26.</NOTE> all of
it:</HI> he tooke the bread and said only, take, eate, <HI>indefinitely:</HI>
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Caluin, &amp; Marl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rat in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oc. Matth.</NOTE> but when he tooke the cup, he did adde an vniuersall note:
<HI>Bib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e omnes:</HI> Drinke ye, drinke all ye.</P>
<P>We conclude therefore with<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Epist&punc; lib. 1. epist. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Cyprian: Adulterum est,
<PB N="115" REF="61">

<P><HI>And so</HI>] Let there be first preparation, and then participa|tion:
when a man is thus examined, let him thus eate. <HI>Let
him eate:</HI> The which are not words of permission, only lea|uing
it to his choice whether he will eate or not eate: but
they are words of <HI>Pauls</HI> commission, insinuating that hee
must eate necessarily, not vpon custome, but vpon consci|ence.
For it is not said here; let him, if hee haue no let at
home, or occasion of absence abroad: if he be neither dis|pleased
with his Pastor, nor angry with the people: but let
him without all let examine, and then let him without all
let eate of this bread. <HI>Eate:</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Mat. 26. 26.</NOTE> Christ in his first institution
hath, <HI>take and eate.</HI> First take, then eate: take not onely into
your mouthes, but into your hands:<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Bucan. loc. com. Tit. coena, Dom. quaest. 34. 35.</NOTE> hereby representing
the soule and faith: for the taking of the bread and wine
into our hand, sealeth our apprehension of Christ by the
finger of faith: Ioh 1. 12. <HI>As many as receiued him to them
he gaue power to be the sonnes of God: euen to them that belee|ued
in his name.</HI> Eating of the bread and drinking of the
wine sealeth our application of Christ incorporated into vs
mystically, 1. Cor. 10. 16. For by the strength of faith wee
chew the cud, as it were, and make Christ our owne. Yet
herein obserue a great difference betweene corporall food
and this heauenly bread: for the one digested is made like
vs, but the other receiued into our soule maketh vs<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 12. Phil. 3. 10.</NOTE> like it.
This action then of taking is very significant: and there|fore
I see no reason why the Priest altering Christs ordi|nance,
should giue the bread into the peoples mouth only,
not into their hand. First, the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> signifieth properly
to take with the hand. Secondly, it is against the rules of
common ciuilitie, that men of discretion, such as Commu|nicants
ought to be, should be fed like children, hauing
their meate put into their mouth. Thirdly, if this taking
be not construed of the hand, but of the mouth, there is an
<PB N="116" REF="62">
idle repetition and plaine <HI>Tautologie</HI> in the words of Christ:
for eating notes <HI>orall</HI> receiuing: and therefore taking must
imply <HI>manuall</HI> receiuing. Fourthly, it was the custome of the
Primitiue Church, as we reade in<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Sixtus Se|nensis, vbi in|fr&agrave;.</NOTE> <HI>Eusebius</HI> and<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Hierosol. orat. 5 mystagog.</NOTE> <HI>Cyril;</HI> How
wilt thou (saith<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Theodoret. hist. lib. 5. cap. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Ambrose</HI> to <HI>Theodosius</HI>) receiue the Lords

<P>The<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Sixtus Senen|si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bibliothec. lib. 6 annot. 152.</NOTE> Papists answere that the Church altered this cu|stome,
because some reserued the bread for magicall spels,
and superstitious vses. A sillie shift: for no abuse can take
away the vse of that which is simply good. The Bible must
be read, albeit some<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">2. Pet. 3. 16.</NOTE> peruert it to their destruction: the
word of God must be preached, howsoeuer it be vnto some
the sauour of<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 2. 16.</NOTE> death vnto death: and so the bread according
to Christs institution must be taken, albeit happily some
keepe it to wicked and idolatrous purposes.</P>
<P><HI>This bread</HI>] The nice distinguishing of the Schoole is
like the pilling of an onyon: they pull off so many skinnes,
vntill at last there is no skinne. They turne and tosse the
words of Christs institution, <HI>Hoc est corpus meum,</HI> so long,
till they bring all that Christ said and did at his last Sup|per
vnto nothing. For so we reade in their<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">De consec. dist. 2. &sect;. timo|rem. Glossa ibi|dem.</NOTE> Glosse, that
<HI>hoc</HI> doth signifie nothing. Omnipotent creatures, who
make of something nothing: and againe of this nothing,
something; yea Christ who made all things: for by pro|nouncing
of these words, <HI>hoc est corpus meum,</HI> they make
their Maker, a dozen gods at once with one sentence. <HI>This,</HI>
is a pronoune demonstratiue, <HI>not indiuiduum, vagum,</HI> any
thing, or a nothing.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">In his Marc. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ton. Con|stant.</NOTE> <HI>Stephen Gardiner</HI> herein forgat his
Grammar and Logicke too. For <HI>hoc,</HI> doth determine, and
must, as <HI>Paul</HI> teacheth, and the circumstances of the Gospell
import, be restrained vnto the bread. <HI>Iesus</HI> tooke the bread,
and when he had giuen thanks hee brake (no doubt the
bread) that hee tooke, and gaue to the Disciples the selfe-same
that he brake, saying, Take ye, eate ye this that I giue
you, <HI>this is my body.</HI> What <HI>This</HI> could our Sauiour meane,
but <HI>This</HI> that he gaue, <HI>This</HI> that hee brake, <HI>This</HI> that hee
tooke? which by the witnesse of truth it selfe was bread. If
the Papists imagine that he tooke bread, but brake it not; or
<PB N="117" REF="62" MS="y">
brake it, but gaue it not: they make the Lords Supper a

<P><HI>Bread.</HI>] It pleased our Sauiour to make bread the out|ward
element in this holy Sacrament, for the manifold ana|logies
between it &amp; his body. First, as bread is the<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Psal. 104. 15.</NOTE> strength
and state of our naturall life; so Christ is for our spirituall be|ing
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 12. 6.</NOTE> all in all.</P>
<P>Secondly, as bread is loathed of the full stomacke, but
most acceptable to the hungry soule; so Christ is most wel|come
vnto such as<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Matth. 5. 6.</NOTE> <HI>hunger and thirst after righteousnes.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, as bread is vsuall and daily; so Christ should be
to the Christian: feeding on that bread which came downe
from<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Iohn 6. 33 35.</NOTE> heauen, should be the soules ordinary refection. fourthly, as bread is made one loafe of many graines; so<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 10. 17.</NOTE> we
that are many are one bread, and one body, because we all
are partakers of one bread.</P>

<P>Lastly, as corne is cut downe with the sithe, threshed in
the barne with many stripes, torne in the mil with much vio|lence,
then boulted &amp; sifted, last of all baked with extreame
heate in the ouen; and all this, that it may be fit meate for
our body: so Christ in his ripe age was cut downe by cruell
death, his body was whipped, his flesh rent asunder, his
soule was as it were<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Lament. 1. 13. Ierem. 1. 12.</NOTE> melted in the fierie furnace of Gods
anger: and all this, that he might become food for our soule;
that we might eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup. The
like resemblances are between the wine and his bloud: For
as wine doth make glad the heart of man, Psal. 104. 15. so
the pretious bloud of Christ, as<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Cant. 2. 5.</NOTE> flagons of wine comforts

<P>It is a fruitfull obseruation of<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Vbi supra.</NOTE> <HI>Martin Luther,</HI> that
Christian religion beginneth not at the highest, as other
religions doe, but at the lowest: it will haue vs to climbe
vp to heauen by <HI>Iacobs</HI> ladder, whose feete touch the very
earth. And therefore when thou art occupied in the matter
of thy saluation, setting aside all curious speculations of
Gods vnsearchable counsels, all cogitations of workes, of
<PB N="122" REF="65" MS="y">
traditions, of Philosophie, yea and of Gods law too, runne
straight to the manger, embrace the little babe Christ in
thine armes, and behold him as hee was borne, sucking,
growing vp, conuersant among men, teaching, dying, rising
againe, ascending aboue the heauens, and hauing power
aboue all things. This sight will make thee shake off all
terrors and errors, as the Sunne driueth away the cloudes.
In a disputation with a <HI>Iew, Turke, Papist, Heretike,</HI> concer|ning
Gods infinite wisedome, Maiestie, power; imploy all
thy wit and industrie to be so profound and subtill as thou
canst: but in the matter of Iustification, wherein thou doest
wrestle with the law, sinne, death, and other spirituall ene|mies;
it is the best course to looke vpon no God, but Christ
incarnate, and cloathed with thine owne nature: to fixe
thine eyes vpon the man Iesus only; who setteth himselfe
foorth vnto thee, to be a Mediatour, and saith,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Matth. 11. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Come vnto

of the world:</HI> and so by the grace of Christ thou shalt vnder|stand
the loue of God, thou shalt perceiue his wisedome,
power, Maiestie, sweetned and tempered to thy capacitie:
thou shalt finde the saying of<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Coloss. 2. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> to be most true, <HI>that in
Christ are hid all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge:</HI> that
Christ in our iustification <HI>is all in all;</HI> and therefore good
reason he should haue the first, and most place in this argu|ment;
that his grace should be named first and last.</P>
<P><HI>The loue of God,</HI> is the fountaine of all goodnes (as Di|uines
speake) <HI>gratiarum gratia:</HI> from which originallie
proceeds euery perfect gift and grace. For almightie God
hath not elected vs in regard of our works, or other worth:
but co~trariwise, because God loued vs, we do that which is
acceptable in his sight. <HI>I obtained mercie of the Lord</HI> (saith

<HI>Versi sunt in profundum.</HI> I come therefore to the <HI>Commu|nion
of the holy Ghost:</HI> a point more comfortable, then or|dinarily
felt, and yet more felt then can be disputed. It is
said, Gal 4. 6. <HI>God hath sent the spirit of his Sonne crying in
our hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s Abba father:</HI> he said not calling, but crying: and
Rom. 8. 26. hee calleth this crying <HI>vnspeakeable groaning.</HI>
When a man is tempted and afflicted, hee feeleth the
strength of his enemies, and the weaknesse of his flesh: he
feeleth the fierie darts of Satan, the terrors of death, the
wrath of God, all these cry out against him horribly: so
that the perplexed soule sees nothing but sinne threatning,
heauen thundering, the diuell roring, the earth trembling,
hell mouth open and ready to swallow him vp. But yet in
the midst of all these, Gods holy spirit crieth in our hearts,
<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Luther. com. in. Gal. 4. 6.</NOTE> <HI>and this cry doth outcry the clamors of the law, the bellowes
of hell, and howlings of infernall fiends:</HI> it pearceth the clouds,
and ascends vp to the eares of God, insomuch that the bles|sed
Angels seeme to heare nothing else but this cry. <HI>The
spirit helpeth our infirmities,</HI> and the<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 12. 9.</NOTE> <HI>strength of Christ is
made perfect through our weaknesse.</HI> For Christ is most power|full,
when as we are most fearfull: euen when we can scarse|ly
groane, marke the words of <HI>Paul; The spirit maketh in|tercession
for vs</HI> in our temptation; not with many words,
or long praiers, he crieth not aloud with teares, haue mer|cie
on me O God: but only giues a little sound, and a feeble
groaning, as, <HI>ah father:</HI> this is but one word, yet notwith|standing
comprehends all things. Indeed the mouth spea|keth
not: but the good affection of the soule crieth aloud
after this manner: O Lord God of compassion and father
of mercies, although I am grieuously vexed on euery side
with affliction and anguish; yet am I thy child, and thou
art my father in Christ. This little word, or rather no word,
but a poore thought, conceiued aright, passeth all the flow|ing
eloquence of <HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Tully,</HI> yea <HI>Tertullian</HI> and
all the Orators that euer were in the world: for this mat|ter
is not expressed with words, but with groanings, and
<PB N="124" REF="66" MS="y">
these groanings are from the blessed Spirit. Thus you see
the large extent of <HI>Pauls</HI> affection, in regard of the thing
wished vnto the Corinthians: <HI>The grace of Christ, the loue of
God, the communion of the holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>The second extension is in regard of the persons, <HI>be with
you all:</HI> for the Pastor must wish well, not only to the best,
or to the worst, but this praier ought to be made for euery
one as well as for any one. There is none so bad, but hath re|ceiued
some grace: none so good but hath need to receiue
more grace. Wherefore pray we still, <HI>that the grace of Christ
may be with vs all.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> addes a third extension in regard
of the time; <HI>for euermore:</HI> the which is implied in the text
also, for the <HI>Corinthians</HI> (as we reade in the<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Cap. 1. vers. 2.</NOTE> former epistle)
<HI>were Saints by calling,</HI> and so doubtlesse had receiued already
<HI>the grace of Christ,</HI> and had tasted <HI>of the loue of God,</HI> through
<HI>the fellowship of the holy Ghost.</HI> He doth therefore now desire

the grace receiued may continue with them, and increase
daily vnto the end, and in the end: that the loue of God
