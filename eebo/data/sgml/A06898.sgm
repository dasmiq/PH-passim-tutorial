<P>I beleue it right wel. For ther be certain bokes whose reme~brau~ce hath falle~ away lo~g before this tyme fro~ the mindes of the people, if they had not fu|riously, and without co~sideratio~ bene conde~pned for heresy.

<P>The Papistes affirme that the synnes of the quicke and deade, are put awaye by the sacrifice of theyr masses, whiche they mum|ble daily. Against thys deuillish doctrine must we set (as an inui|sible bulwarke) thys texte of ble|ssed. S. Paule. It became vs to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebrue. vii</NOTE> haue suche an hye prieste, as is holye, innocente, vndefiled, sepe|rate fro~ sinners, and made high|er then heauen, whyche neadeth not dayly (as the other priestes) to offer Sacrifice fyrste for hys owne synnes, and then for the syns of the people. For this did he, that is to saye, Christe, once for all, when he offered vp hym selfe. Lette these sacrificers here
<PB REF="92">
note, that no prieste can offer a|ny sacrifice for oure synnes but suche a one as is holy, innocent vndefiled. &amp;c. whyche is Iesus Christe alone. Seyng then that they wante thys holynes, inno|cency, puritie. &amp;c. It is euidente by. S. Pauls wordes, that they can not sacrifice neyther for the quicke nor for the dead.</P>
<P>Agayne blessed Paule sayeth, that thys euerlastynge priest Ie sus Christe, neadeth not daylye (as the other priests) to offer sa|crifice, whyche by one oblation of him selfe hath deliuered for e|uermore so manye as beleue in hym, from al theyr sinnes. Ueri|li these missars are altogither a|mise. What wyll they say now?</P>
<P>If Christe neade no more to offer sacrifice, muche lesse neede the priestes. If one oblation of Christe be altogyther suffitiente
<PB REF="92">
the~ are the dayly oblatio~s of the popish massemo~gers vaine and vnprofitable. If Christe offered hym selfe once for al, then canne not the papists offer hym so ofte~ as it pleaseth them. Whereof it maye be concluded, that they do no thynge in theyr satisfactorye masses but blaspheme the Lord and hys annoynted, seynge they so arrogantly arrogate vnto the~ selfes power to offer sacrifice for the sins of the people, when this one oblation of oure Sauioure and Lorde Christe Iesus is all whollye suffitiente, and thorow|lye able in euerye poynte euen vnto the vttermooste to saue all the electe &amp; chose~ people of God, yea and y^t so abu~dau~tlye &amp; at the ful, y^t henseforth there nedeth no reiteracio~ nor no renewing ther|of. If ther were no mo scripturs to co~demne this wicked opinion
<PB REF="93">
of the Sacrifice of the masse but thys one tofore recited, it myght seme to any christen iudgement sufficient to subuert, ouerthrowe &amp; tople downe, what so euer the Papists haue builded vpon the sande of theyr owne inuentions these certayne hundred yeres.</P>
<P>What is chaffe in comparison <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ieremy. xxiii.</NOTE> to wheate, sayeth the Lorde? Is not my word lyke fyre, sayth the Lord? and lyke a twibytte clea|uynge the rocke of stonne?

<P><PB REF="93">
Agayne in the later ende of the same chapter, Christe is not en|tred into y^e holye places that are made wyth handes (whyche are but similitudes of true thyngs) but into the very heauen, for to appeare nowe before the face of God for vs. Not to ofter hym selfe ofte as the hygh prieste en|tereth into the holy place euerye yere with strange bloude, for the~ muste he often haue suffred se~ce the worlde began. But nowe in the ende of the worlde, hathe he appeared once for all, to put syn to flyght by the offerynge vp of hym selfe. And as it is appoyn|ted vnto me~, that they shall once dye, and then commeth the iudg mente, euen so Christe was once offered to take away the synnes of many. Blessed Paule hath no shyfte of descante, but singeth e|uer one songe, nothinge lesse the~

Therfore Christe the hyghe prieste in these laste day|es became manne, and was not offered of anye other, but he of|fered hym self, yea and that once for all for the sinnes of so manye as vnfaynedly repente and tru|lye beleue, and hys oblation for euer &amp; euer abydeth of so greate strength, vertue and power, that that alone &amp; none other, chaseth awai, &amp; putteth to flight the sins of many both of Iewes &amp; ge~tils if thei beleue.

<PB REF="95">
resite the oblatio of Christes bo|dy, yea &amp; that once for all, &amp; stifly affirmeth that by that once offe|rynge vp of him selfe we are per fectly sanctified and made holy. What nede the~ haue we of y^e sa|crifice of y^e masse to be made ho|lye, if there were any suche sacri|fice, as the papisticall sacrificers faine? It foloweth also in y^e same chapter. Euery prieste is readye daylye ministerynge, and often times offreth one maner of offe|rynge, whyche canne neuer take awaye synnes. But thys manne that is to saye, Christe, when he had offered for synnes one sacri|fice, whyche is of value for euer, sate hym downe on the ryghte hande of God, and from thence|forthe tarieth, tyll hys foes be made his fote stole.

<PB REF="95">
thys one sentence maketh to fall flatte vpon the grounde, al that euer the Papistes haue builded for the mayntenaunce of theyr Missall sacrifice.

<P>Death shal haue no more pow|er ouer hym. For as towchynge that he dyed, he dyed as concer|nynge sin once, but as towching
<PB REF="96">
that he lyueth, he liueth to God. Fourthlye, that wyth one offe|rynge he hath made perfecte for euerthem y^t are sanctified. If we be made perfecte wyth one offe|rynge, whych is the oblation of Christes body vpon the aultare of the crosse, what imperfection remayneth there in vs, that wee shuld haue nede of the missal sa|crifice: If one Sacrifice make vs perfecte for euer, what neede wee to haue so manye sacrifices offered daylye in the Popeyshe masses?

<P>The Masse, saye they, makein men holy, yea it maketh them ryghtuous and deliuereth them from sinnes. The Masse is a sacrifice, and not the sygne of a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The doctrine of the papists</NOTE> sacrifice onelye. In the Masse is

The masse of a prieste, be he neuer so naughti, is profitable <HI>ex opere operato</HI> Christ w^t his pa ssion satisfied for originall synne and instituted the masse to be an oblacion for the synnes commit|ted dayely, boeth mortall and ve niall. To heare masse is the hono ringe of God, whither the hearer vnderstandeth it or not. <HI>Missa</HI> soundeth sacrifice, ergo the masse is a sacrifice, <HI>Missa</HI> is deriued of <HI>Mitto,</HI> to sende, for in the masse the lamb, that is to say, Christ is sente vnto the father to forgeue oure synnes. The Masse deliue|reth s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ulles from purgatorye, for asmuche as it is a satisfactory sa|crifice for synnes. Not onely the sacrifice of Christ, wherin he offe|red hym selfe, was a sacrifice for synne, but we also offer for oure
<PB REF="107">
sinnes a continual sacrifice in the masse. The sacrifice of Christ ob|tayneth mercy onely for original synne, and for the synnes paste. The sacrifice of the masse euerye daye, is the true sacrifice for syn|nes. Althoughe Christ was once offered on the crosse in the open likenesse of fleshe, yet is the same Christe dayelye offered on the al|tare at masse. The wordes of con secracion duly spoke~ of the priest there is made a transubstantia|cion of wyne into the bloude of Christe and of the bread into hys bodye. Euery man may lawfully worshippe the hoste consecrated. Althoughe Paule calleth the sa|cramente of the Supper breade, yet maye we not beleue therefore that the substaunce of breade re|maineth in the sacrament. Christ saide. <HI>Hoc est corpus meum.</HI> This is my bodye, therefore muste we
<PB REF="107">
nedes holde, that there is a tran|substantiacion, and that the sub|staunce of breade is chaunged in to the bodye of Christe. The bo|dye of Christe is presente in the Masse so greate and large, as it was, wha~ it hanged on the crosse Forasmuch as Christe that most hyghe maiestie of God is present at the masse, therefore is it verye godly to appointe many ceremo|nies, that Christ may be entertay ned honorably. Masse ought not to be sayed but in an holye place and vpon an altare of stone, for Christe him selfe is called a stone The masse amonge al the suffra|ges for the deade, doeth profitte moste of all for the deliueraunce of soulles out of purgatory. By hearinge of masse we maye ob|tayne not onely spiritual goodes but all maner of corporall and temporall goodes also. The can|non
<PB REF="108">
of the masse is godly and ca|tholyke and it was ordeyned of the Apostles. The masse, <HI>ex opere operato,</HI> iustifieth and taketh a|way the giltines of the faute and payne in the~, for whom it is done With y^e sacrifice of the Masse the satisfactio~s of the deade are rede med. The masse, <HI>ex opere operato</HI> geueth grace, and beyng applied for other deserueth vnto them <HI>ex opere operato,</HI> forgyuenes of the faute and payne, and obtayneth what so euer we haue nede of in al oure lyfe. In the olde testame~t ther was a byshop, that offered sacrifices for the synnes of y^e peo|ple, therefore in the newe testa|mente muste ther be priestes and Byshoppes to offere sacrifices for sinnes. The body of the Lord once offered on the crosse for ori|ginall synne, is continually offe|red for dayly sinnes vpon the al|tare,
<PB REF="108">
that by thys meanes the churche maye haue a gyfte, wher wyth they may pacifie the wrath of god. It is an heresy of the Ar|rians to holde that the masse is not a sacrifice for the quicke and the deade. Howe saye ye Neighe|boures to thys doctryne of the massekynge papistes? Is it not good stuffe?</P>

<P>Not onely the blessed mar|tyre Ignatius shewed him selfe wylling and ioyfull to suffer all kynde of aduersitie, yea verye death for the co~fession of Christ, and of hys blessed trueth, but o|ther holye men innumerable, as we reade in histories. Whe~ De|cius the Emperoure that mooste cruel tyraunte hadde spoyled the blessed martyre Hypolitus of his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypolitus.</NOTE> vestures, bycause he woulde not do sacrifice to false Gods, the ma~ of God spake boldely vnto him, sayinge, thou haste not spoyled me of my garmentes, but thou haste rather begun to clothe me. And when the aforsayde tyraunt co~maunded that he should be clo thed agayne w^t his own accusto|med kynd of apparaile, and said vnto hym. Use thyne olde seruice
<PB REF="163">
whych thou hast euer had in our syght, &amp; be our frende: the blessed martyre w^t a stoute courage an|swered, my seruyse is thys, faith|fully to serue Christe, and by ser|uyng him, spedly to come vnto a frutefull victory. Shortlye after the tirant seyng his stedfast and vnshake~ co~sta~cy co~mau~ded him to be depryued of all hys goodes and to be headed w^t diuers other about y^e nu~bre of nintene, whiche al wyth ioyfull courage suffered death for Christes sake. The ble|ssed martyre Tiburtius was ap|prehe~ded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tiburtius</NOTE> of y^e cruel iudge Fabia~, and co~mau~ded either to offer sa|crifice to y^e Idols, or els to go w^t naked fete vpo~ the hote burning coles.

<P>For thorowe the myghte of my Lorde Iesus Christe, me thynke that goyng vpon burnyng coles I walke as it were vpo~ red roses w^tout fealynge of anye paine or hurt of my fete. For the creature obeyeth the commaundement of the creatoure. When the tyraunt sawe that the fyre dyd hym no harme, he commaunded that he should be slayne w^t the swerd.</P>
<P>The blessed martyre wente vnto hys deathe wyth a toyfull herte, praysynge God, that he woulde vouchsafe to gyue hym strength for to confesse his mooste blessed name &amp; holy word before worldly tyrantes. When Galerius the Proconsull co~maunded that. S. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciprian.</NOTE> Cipria~ should be headed, bicause he was an enemy to the Goddes of the Romains, and wold serue none but Christe alone the sonne

I thanke almygh|ty God, whyche voucheth safe to losen me from the ba~des of this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mauricius &amp; his fellowes</NOTE> body. And so died. When Max|imianus that moste cruell Empe roure commaunded hys souldi|ours to worshyppe false Goddes and to slea so manye as professed Christ &amp; hys blessed word, Mau|ricius w^t his felowes answered that eyther in worshypping false Goddes, or in sleaynge the true Christians, they by no meanes would obeye the Emperour, We are, sayd they, thy souldidur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, O Emperour, but yet we frely con|fesse, that wee are the seruauntes of God, which gaue vs thys our life.

<P>I could re|hearse many mo godly hystories to declare w^t what a readye wyll wyth howe reioysing an hert, the blessed martyrs of Christ suffred all maner of bitter tormentes for the Lords sake, but these at this presente shall suffice.</P>
<P>For hereof maye ye learne to practise thys word of the Apostle Alway. I mean to reioyce in the Lorde our God not onely in pro|speritie, but also in aduersitie, be it in sycknes, losse of goodes, po|uertie, persecution, or anye other crosse, y^t god our father laieth v|po~ vs. For this the duty of a true

christen ma~ to co~ceyue that same <NOTE PLACE="marg">Note</NOTE> fayeth, hope and ioye, in God, when he is assayled in tribulati|on, that he had before, when all thynges were moste prosperouse to him. So meaneth the Apostle when he sayeth. Reioyce in the Lorde alwaye. And bycause he woulde haue vs earnestlye to re|ioyce in the Lorde at al tymes, be it in prosperitie or aduersitie, he doubleth this word, Reioyce, sai|yng. Reioyce in the Lord alway yea once agayne, I saye reioyce. Piththye and full of efficacye is thys sentence of the Apostle, and comprehendeth in it many God|ly misteries, as ye haue hytherto partely hearde. S. Paule desie|reth nothyng more, then that we shoulde reioyce in the Lord. His ioye is altogyther in God, there|fore would he, that yours should be so lykewyse. And vnto thys
