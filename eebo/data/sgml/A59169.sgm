<HEAD>TO THE NOBLE and MOST VERTUOUS LADY, <HI>Mrs.</HI> ANNE LEEDES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HEre you see, what dili|gence I have used to involve my self into a Lab'rinth, out of which, my judgement is not clew sufficient to conduct me. I blush when I remember, how I have betrayed mine own weaknesse to the publike view; and like <HI>Cae|crops</HI> Daughter, tempted my MI|NERVA


<PB REF="4">
to mine owne ruine, for daring to discover an Infant with such deformed feet. I have reason to feare, 'that those knowing spi|rits, the right heires to all those sacred fountaines within the Di|ocesse of the Myter'd Hill; those profest Champions of Poesie, who are so jealous of the Muses Honour, will be strict in their examinations, severe in their cen|sures, and where they find an in|truder, whose follies are stript thus naked as are mine, liberally use that lash which was justly put into their hands. But when they shal know, I am not so wedded to self-love, but that (were I per|mitted to cast my bean into the Urne) I should bee as ready to


<PB REF="4">
condemne my self, as expect my sentence from another; Perhaps, so ingenious a confession might in noble minds quite pluck out the sting of Anger, and make their reprehensions rather arise from pitty, or a Fatherly affection, then Revenge: but then I tremble to thinke how I stand engaged a|mongst all that ignorant and cen|sorious Rabble, who because Na|ture (foreseeing how lavish they would be of that little which they had) durst not trust them with a|ny considerable stock of wit, be|leeve they are priviledg'd to cry it down in others; Men, that, con|scious of their owne basenesse, obstinately arme against truth and knowledge, and by custome of


<PB REF="5">
Malice are grown so barbarous, as they will vindicate a Prostitute, or set a spurious birth upon the highest point of Honour; but endeavour to stab their forked tongues into the bosome of the most chast and noble Virgin; my meaning is, that they will cherish common and shallow fancies; Births so infamous, that they can onely speak their Parents shame, when a Legitime Poem often falls a sacrifice to the many-head|ed and no brained Multitude. From the rage of these, I fly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o you for Protection, as confident (how desperately soever other|wise bent,) they dare not violate so holy a Sanctuary. Nor doe I doubt, but you will guard


<PB REF="5">
me from so treacherous and un|just an Enemy, as pretends to re|prove my Faults; but indeed acts his own Malice, and would have persecuted me worse, had this been better. Neither am I so im|pudent, as to desire you should, against the equity of your own Conscience, defend a trifle, and approve to others what you your self mislike: No (Madame) I re|quest you to be my Judge as well as Patron; as well to punish where you finde me faulty, as to protect me Innocent; and if af|ter due examination had, my whole Book shall appeare guilty of cheating my Readers out of so much time for nothing, sentence it to the fire; and beleeve me, I


<PB REF="6">
would not bewaile mine owne sufferings, if condemned by so Legall a Process. But if you shall be pleased to receive it into any de|gree of Favour, I shall be secure, that it is not altogether to be de|spised, and in that confidence, dare, both vindicate my self unto the world, and make my owne revenge of such as shall provoke me. Your wisdome, Justice, and singular affection to the MUSES, (to wrong whom, I beleeve you esteem, as well as I, a sinne next Sacriledge) may sufficiently war|rant all men, that your Judgment will be unbias'd. Therefore as that shall determine of me, I will either quietly submit my selfe to all censures, or rise up in defence

of my Innocence. In the meane time, I will not speake one word in mine own behalfe; onely if this shall faile your expectation, and prove unworthy this Honour it is advanced to; I beseech you ex|ercise both your Justice and Mer|cy, burne it, but forgive him, who will ever esteeme it his greatest happinesse to be reckn'd amongst the number of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Iudicious Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS I must confesse, nothing could please me more, than to know that my endea|vours had pleased thee; so I must tell thee, nothing can trouble me less than the knowledge that they have not; chuse how thy judgement be stated, I am resolved to make my benesit of it; for if thy applause shall crowne these first Essaies of my Youth, the highest soaring ambition could not have expected a more grateful successe, than that, which (besides an ample recompence for what I have already done) brings along with it sufficient matter of encouragement for the future, and (as it were) kindly con|strains me to continue the pursuite of a stu|dy, which mine owne Inclinaaion hath but


<PB REF="8">
too violently begun, making that appeare the child of gratitude which is now perhaps by some accounted folly. Nor doe I doubt, but the&punc; affectionate Zeale of a thankfull soul, togeather with a gen'rous scorn to bely a judgement so advantagious to my selfe, will prompt my <HI>Genius</HI> to higher and bra|ver things for thy pleasure, then ever yet I could attaine to for mine own; but if with what I seek to obtain thy favour, I shall on|ly purchase a meritorious anger, thou mayst condemn these trifles, <HI>ad ficum &amp; pipe|rem,</HI> or if thou wilt (as unserviceable even there) to more base and servile offices; and beleeve me, I can forgoe (without the least act of repentance) so fruitlesse a study, as yeelds me neither fame nor profit; nor shall I esteem it a smal peece of friendship to stop my wild carreere, my foot being upon so dangerous a <HI>Praecipice.</HI> Thus far to thee, whose censure is grounded upon the sure foundation of an uncorrupted reason. Now thou, who makest a <HI>Lottery</HI> of thy mouth, and shuffling thy words together, fetchest thy dislike or approbation from the meere vertue of <HI>chance,</HI> mayst be pleas'd to consi|der,


<PB REF="8">
that I shall not easily be afraid of noise, that am so confident against the most im|minent dangers, therefore if thy sick palate cannot relish such cates as I have set before thee; if thou look upon my lines with such a kinde of an <HI>odium,</HI> as petulant Curres do upon Forrainers, bark till thy spleen burst, thou hurtst not me; but if the toy take thee to give me a wretched commendation, I shal but give thee cold thanks, with a <HI>non mi|nimum est quod stultis placui.</HI> Thus you may both see that I (being above either hope or feare) crave not any thing at your hands, onely one small request I have, and that li|tle relating to my self; namely, that since some Friends have been pleased to usher my darke f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">et into the World, that you would not by my weaknesse measure their discreti|on, but affection: grant this, and however you censure me, I shall continue</P>
