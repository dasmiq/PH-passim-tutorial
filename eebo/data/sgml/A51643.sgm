<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe secret love of <HI>Hero</HI> and
<HI>Leander</HI> first brought to
light in the pure Greeke of
divine <HI>Musaeus,</HI> was after|ward
new moulded in <HI>Latin</HI>
by the fluent <HI>Ovid;</HI> in imita|tion
of whose Epistles, the most eminent Po&euml;ts
of all Climates have (in their native languages)
<PB REF="3">
written upon this subject so many Paraphrases
and Essayes, that like the numerous streames
of <HI>Nile,</HI> they almost overflow the remem|brance
of their fountaine. I confesse the report
of Po&euml;ms borrowed from <HI>Musaeus</HI> made so
great a noyse, that to mee the Authour had
beene lost in the crowd of his Imitatours, if I
had not heard his soft lines sweetned by your
Lordship's accent; but then, I could not be sa|tisfied
till I made triall how the <HI>Greeke</HI> would
goe in <HI>English:</HI> my intent being to translate
and dedicate it privately to your Lordship.
The Translation was forthwith dispatched, the
Dedication is now presented, but the intended
Privacie lay not in my power; for my acquain|tance
(who would know what I was doing) had
ingaged me for so many Copies, that I held it
my safest course, rather to venture upon the
Printers pardonable errours, then to runne the
hazzard of grosse mistakes in ignorant Tran|scribers.
Yet, as I could not make it altogether
<PB REF="3">
private, so I resolved it should not be altogether
publique, and have therefore suffered no more
to be printed, then the just number promised;
which coming into friends hands, I cannot
feare any rigid censure. But if some pretending
Criticke shall assault mee, I shall smile to see
him retire with double speed, beholding the
name of the illustrious and learned person that

<L>_SPeak Goddesse, of the Torch, a witnesse made</L>

<L>Hearke, the Torch ruffled by the wind I heare,</L>
<L>The steering Torch that did to <HI>Venus</HI> guide,</L>
<L>The flaming Signall of the clowded Bride,</L>
<L>The Torch that for night-service aiery <HI>Iove</HI></L>
<L>Should make a Starre, the starre of wandring Love,</L>
<L>The marriage-starre, because it still gave ayme,</L>
<L>And watcht the marriage-houres with sleeplesse flame;</L>
<L><PB REF="5">
Till by the rude wind th' envious Gust was blowne;</L>
<L>And then (aye me) change <HI>Hymen's</HI> softer tone,</L>
<L>And let our Verse with one sad close be crown'd,</L>
<L>O'th' Torch extinguisht, and <HI>Leander</HI> drown'd.</L>
<L>Vpon the Sea-shore, parted by the floud</L>
<L>Two Cities <HI>Sestos</HI> and <HI>Abydos</HI> stood,</L>
<L>Iust o'rethwart neighbours; his bow <HI>Cupid</HI> bent,</L>
<L>And to both Cities the same Arrow sent,</L>
<L>Wherewith a youth and virgin were inflam'd,</L>
<L>He sweet <HI>Leander,</HI> she chast <HI>Hero</HI> nam'd,</L>
<L>He at <HI>Abydos,</HI> she at <HI>Sestos</HI> borne;</L>
<L>Starres, like each other, which their Townes adorne.</L>
<L>Do mee a favour if you passe that way,</L>
<L>Aske for the Tow'r where Sestian <HI>Hero</HI> lay,</L>
<L>And held the Torch, wafting <HI>Leander</HI> o're:</L>
<L>Aske for his Dwelling on the adverse shore,</L>
<L>Where still his fun'rals old <HI>Abydos</HI> keepes,</L>
<L>And in his Love's and Death's remembrance weepes.</L>
<L>But dwelt he at <HI>Abydos?</HI> how then came</L>
<L>He to love <HI>Hero,</HI> she to catch his flame?</L>
<L>Faire <HI>Hero,</HI> virgin-Priestesse to the Power</L>
<L>Of <HI>Venus,</HI> her great Parents in a tower</L>
<L><PB REF="5">
From them apart, neare to the Sea had plac't;</L>
<L>Another <HI>Venus,</HI> but so strictly chast,</L>
<L>That she at female meetings ne're appear'd,</L>
<L>Nor her young play-mates charming Dances heard,</L>
<L>Regardfull women's envy to decline,</L>
<L>For at a Beauty women will repine.</L>
<L>But she with incense <HI>Venus</HI> still appeas'd,</L>
<L>Oft with his heav'nly Mother <HI>Cupid</HI> pleas'd,</L>
<L>Whose Quiver trembles full of shafts that glow,</L>
<L>But yet those flameing shafts she scap't not so.</L>
<L>The <HI>Sestians</HI> now that Feast they so much prize</L>
<L>To <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Adonis</HI> solemnize.</L>
<L>O're to this Holyday in boats-full throng</L>
<L>All th' Islanders that to the Sea belong;</L>

<L>None dance on <HI>Libanon</HI> in perfum'd aire;</L>
<L>No passengers but to this Feast repaire;</L>
<L>There wants of neighbouring <HI>Abydos</HI> none;</L>
<L>Of young men that love maids not any one,</L>

<L><PB REF="6">
Not that th' immortall Gods their zeale pursues,</L>
<L>But troopes of mortall beauties to peruse.</L>
<L>Now through the Temple Virgin-<HI>Hero</HI> past,</L>
<L>And from her face a lovely splendour cast,</L>
<L>Like the cleare Moone when rising she's beheld;</L>
<L>Her snovvy cheekes in scarlet circles svvell'd,</L>
<L>So lookes the blovving Damaske Rose, You'd svveare</L>
<L>In <HI>Hero</HI> gardens full of Roses vvere.</L>
<L>She blush't all over, in the polish't stone</L>
<L>Beneath her feete reflected Roses shone.</L>
<L>From her flovv'd many Graces; then of old</L>
<L>They ly'd that Men but of three Graces told,</L>
<L>For in each smiling eye of <HI>Hero</HI> sprung</L>
<L>A hundred Graces: Thus said every tongue,</L>
<L><HI>Venus</HI> hath novv a Preistesse vvorthy her,</L>
<L>All men this maide to her whole Sex preferre,</L>
<L><HI>Venus</HI> 'es Preistesse a new <HI>Venus</HI> seemes,</L>
<L>So her the heart of conquer'd Youth esteemes.</L>
<L>Nor was there any but he <HI>Hero</HI> lov'd,</L>
<L>And wish't she were his Bride: where e're she mov'd</L>
<L>Through the strong fabricke of that sacred place,</L>
<L>Alleyes all hearts and longings went her pace.</L>
<L><PB REF="6">
One Youth admiring of her spake these words,</L>
<L>I've seene what beauty <HI>Sparta</HI>'s Clime affords,</L>
<L>And what in <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> so much takes,</L>
<L>Where Beauty to the world her Challenge makes;</L>
<L>But one so sweet so modest I've not seene,</L>
<L>Sure one o'th' Graces here attends Loves Queene?</L>
<L>I've tir'd my sight, not satisfy'd my eye,</L>
<L>Let me but sleepe with <HI>Hero</HI> and then dye.</L>
<L>I would not wish to be a Pow'r divine,</L>
<L>So I might live at home, and <HI>Hero</HI> mine&punc;</L>
<L>But if unto thy Preistesse to pretend</L>
<L>Be Sacriledge, one like her, <HI>Venus,</HI> send.</L>
<L>Thus every youth said: there another had</L>
<L>A wound, and with concealing it ran mad.</L>
<L>But brave <HI>Leander,</HI> this rare maid when thou</L>
<L>Beheldst, thou wouldst not of dumbe wounds allow,</L>
<L>But at the fiery arrow's very fall</L>
<L>Thou'lt with faire <HI>Hero</HI> live, or not at all.</L>
<L>Love at her eye-beames did his torches light,</L>
<L>And fir'd <HI>Leanders</HI> bosome at first sight.</L>
<L>For beauty in a maid whose fame is pure,</L>
<L>Flyes like the feather'd shaft, and hits more sure.</L>
<L><PB REF="7">
The eyes are loop-holes, her eye's fatall dart</L>
<L>Glanc't through his eye, and gaz'd upon his heart.</L>
<L>Amazement, feare, shame, impudence, he felt;</L>
<L>His sense amaz'd on her perfections dwelt,</L>
<L>His heart shooke, shame restrain'd him, love controll'd</L>
<L>That shame, and made him impudently bold.</L>
<L>He softly walk't and stood before the maide,</L>
<L>And to her slily a side-looke convey'd,</L>
<L>With silent eyes foarding the virgins minde.</L>
<L>When she <HI>Leander's</HI> cunning love did finde,</L>
<L>She joy'd in her owne beauty: and ev'n She</L>
<L>Oft lifted her faire eyes by stealth to see</L>
<L><HI>Leander's</HI> face, then lookt away againe;</L>
<L>He joyed that he did love, nor she disdaine.</L>
<L>While now a private houre <HI>Leander</HI> watcht,</L>
<L>Day to the West the light's small stocke dispatcht,</L>
<L>Point-blanke the shadow'd evening-starre appear'd.</L>
<L>Then to approach her he no longer fear'd,</L>
<L>But as he saw the sky with sables hung</L>
<L>He silently her rosy fingers wrung,</L>
<L>And fetcht a deepe sigh: she did nothing say,</L>
<L>But, as if angry, snatcht her hand away.</L>
<L><PB REF="7">
Finding her discomposure he grew bold,</L>
<L>And of her rich flowr'd vesture taking hold</L>
<L>Pull'd her into the Temples secret'st part:</L>
<L>As 'twere a Pilgrimage against her heart</L>
<L>Lingringly follow'd the slow-footed Maide,</L>
<L>And threatning, thus in womens language said:</L>
<L>What, stranger, art thou mad? why pull'st thou so</L>
<L>A maid? away, leave, let my garment go.</L>
<L>Shun my rich Parents anger. To court mee,</L>
<L>Priestesse to <HI>Venus,</HI> it befits not thee.</L>
<L>'Tis hard to come unto a Virgin's bed.</L>
<L>Thus lessons, maides are perfect in, she read.</L>
<L><HI>Leander</HI> hearing female fury sound,</L>
<L>The Symptomes straight of yeilding virgins found,</L>
<L>For when with men maides once are furious growne</L>
<L>Their very threatnings promise them our owne.</L>
<L>Then her sweete-smelling pure-skinn'd neck he kist,</L>
<L>And spake these words, wherein love's pangs assist.</L>
<L><HI>Venus</HI> next <HI>Venus, Pallas</HI> whom I love,</L>
<L>Next <HI>Pallas,</HI> daughters to <HI>Saturnian Iove,</HI></L>

<L>Come, be the Preistesse of her pleasures too,</L>
<L>These ceremonies learne: a maid and be</L>
<L>Preistesse to <HI>Venus,</HI> it befits not thee.</L>
<L>Maides <HI>Venus</HI> loves not; her true rites if thou</L>
<L>Wouldst know, they are the nuptiall bed and vow.</L>
<L>Doe you love <HI>Venus?</HI> Love's soft lawes fulfill,</L>
<L>Call me your servant (call me, if you will,</L>
<L>Your husband) chac'd and caught by <HI>Cupids</HI> art,</L>
<L>Brought to your service by his golden dart,</L>
<L>As rough <HI>Alcides</HI> by the golden wand</L>
<L>Of <HI>Hermes,</HI> to the <HI>Lydian</HI> Maid's command;</L>
<L>But in this voyage to your presence made</L>

<L>Who made the once-despis'd her sole-belov'd.</L>
<L>Deare, be more kind lest <HI>Venus</HI> take it ill.</L>
<L>Thus he perswaded her against her will,</L>
<L><PB REF="8">
Softning her mind with love and passion mixt;</L>
<L>Silently on the ground her eye she fixt,</L>
<L>Asham'd the Twi-light should her blushes meete,</L>
<L>Re-polishing the marble with her feete,</L>
<L>And gathering, at every little checke</L>
<L>Giv'n by her heart, her robe about her necke.</L>
<L>All tokens that a maid's consent fore-run,</L>
<L>Who if she doe but loose her tongue, she's won.</L>
<L>Love's bitter-sweetenesse now she working felt,</L>

<L>The deaw, that long had on her blushes hung,</L>
<L>Then dropt, and these words from her sweetest tongue.</L>
<L>Stranger, thy words might on a rocke have wrought,</L>
<L>Who thee the various wayes of Courtship taught?</L>
<L>Who did (alas) thee to my Country send?</L>
<L>But all which thou hast spoke is to no end,</L>

Nor can we marry publickly 'tis cleare,</L>

<L>Thus speaking, with her veyle her face she hid,</L>
<L>Againe blusht, and her selfe for speaking chid.</L>
<L><HI>Leander,</HI> on love's highest torture rack't,</L>
<L>Was soone inspir'd how love's designe to act.</L>
<L>For man's heart pow'rfull <HI>Cupid</HI> conquers twice,</L>

<L>Innavigable: to arrive thy bed,</L>

<L>But thy wet servant shall the waves confront,</L>
<L>And nightly swimme the raging <HI>Hellespont.</HI></L>
<L>Only on your high Turret set a light</L>

<L>Oft wishing for the bed-adorning night.</L>
<L>Night now soft rest upon her raven wings</L>
<L>To all but to love-sicke <HI>Leander</HI> brings,</L>
<L>Who on the lowd Sea's ever-chasing Bay,</L>
<L>Did but for <HI>Hymen's</HI> shining summons stay,</L>

<L>By that bright Vsher to his private bed.</L>
<L>As soone as e're thick darknesse veyl'd the night</L>

<L>But from Sea hearing th' angry billowes scold,</L>

<L>Turbanded with his silken robe his head,</L>
<L>Leapt from the shoare, o'th' waves his body spread,</L>

<L>The South against the North strong tempests brought,</L>
<L>The mercilesse and foaming surges roar'd;</L>
<L>Poore youth he sea-borne <HI>Venus</HI> oft implor'd,</L>
<L>Oft <HI>Neptune</HI> King of Seas would have inclin'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Boreas</HI> of <HI>Atthis</HI> put in minde,</L>
<L>But none helpt. Fate by Love was not controll'd,</L>
<L>Quite over him the justling billowes roll'd;</L>
<L>His strong legs faile him, motionlesse now stands</L>
<L>The nimble vigour of his active hands,</L>
<L>The water downe his throate at pleasure flow'd,</L>
<L>The giddy Seas their uselesse drinke bestow'd.</L>
<L>And the false torch out as the sharpe winde tost,</L>
<L>His Love and Life bemourn'd <HI>Leander</HI> lost.</L>
<L>The Sea her waking eyes did still survey,</L>
<L>And in her sad breast flow'd another sea.</L>
<L>Day not her Husband <HI>Hero</HI> seeing then,</L>
<L>The Sea's broad backe view'd to the utmost kenne,</L>
<L><PB REF="12">
To see if any where <HI>Leander</HI> came,</L>
<L>Who, as the torch went out, might loose his aime.</L>
<L>But when she saw him on the billowes borne</L>
<L>At her tow'r foot, and by the rocks all torne,</L>
<L>She neare her heart rent her embroider'd gowne,</L>
<L>And to the body, shrikeing out, leap't downe.</L>
<L>For her lost Husband she her selfe destroy'd,</L>
<L>And ev'n in death each other they enjoy'd.</L>
