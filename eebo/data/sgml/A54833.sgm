<P><HI>THough I could not well answer your</HI> former Rea|sons <HI>why I should publish a</HI> true Copy <HI>to</HI> anticipate <HI>a</HI> false <HI>one, yet I was willing to be</HI> obstinate <HI>in a case of</HI> this nature; <HI>wherein to</HI> vindicate <HI>my</HI> credit, <HI>did seem (to me) too great a</HI> prejudice <HI>to my</HI> ease; <HI>and was thought (by some friends) to be a</HI> hazarding <HI>of my</HI> safety. <HI>And as I have never been delighted to lye</HI> busking <HI>in the</HI> Sun, <HI>so of late (more especially) I have been even so</HI> Amo|rous <HI>of living</HI> retiredly <HI>in the</HI> shade, <HI>that I would fain have provided for my</HI> Peace <HI>and</HI> Quiet, <HI>as more conside|rable to</HI> me <HI>then my</HI> Reputation. <HI>Not that I dare be so</HI> wedded <HI>to</HI> ease, <HI>or</HI> safety, <HI>as</HI> guiltily <HI>to</HI> court <HI>them by</HI> sloth, <HI>or</HI> cowardize; <HI>nor that I dare be so</HI> indifferent <HI>to the</HI> good opinion <HI>of</HI> good men, <HI>as not to</HI> desire <HI>to be ve|ry</HI> well thought on; <HI>but because I had resolv'd to</HI> sit <HI>and</HI> smile <HI>upon my</HI> sufferings, <HI>and to purchase the</HI> continuance <HI>of my</HI> beloved obscurity <HI>and</HI> repose, <HI>by that which I thought a</HI> lawful means; <HI>even the</HI> burying <HI>my self amongst my</HI> books, <HI>and living under the</HI> protection <HI>of</HI> passive si|lence. <HI>But having put my</HI> Judgement <HI>into other mens</HI> hands, <HI>and more especially into</HI> yours, <HI>and being perfectly</HI> conquer'd <HI>by your</HI> this weeks <HI>letter, who was but</HI> disor|der'd <HI>by your</HI> last, <HI>(against which I must confesse I did ra|ther</HI> stand out, <HI>by an affected</HI> deafnesse, <HI>then any real dissent) and being now no longer threatned by</HI> bare report, <HI>but by</HI> one <HI>who professeth</HI> (<HI>under</HI> hand <HI>and</HI> Seal) <HI>to have

<P N="1">THat I am subject to <HI>errors,</HI> it is no <HI>humi|lity</HI> to acknowledge; it being no more then to confesse, that I carry about me the infirmities of a <HI>man;</HI> which whoso|ever doth not, let <HI>him cast the first stone at me.</HI> But whether or no I am an <HI>Heretique,</HI> or a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 8. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> <HI>dangerous person,</HI> I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sire my <HI>Censors</HI> may be my <HI>Iudges;</HI> and do therefore addresse this present <HI>Apo|logie</HI> and <HI>Appeal,</HI> not to the <HI>kindnesse</HI> and <HI>partiality</HI> of my dearest <HI>friends,</HI> but to the very <HI>jealousies</HI> and <HI>pre|judices</HI> of my severest <HI>enemies.</HI> I bar the suffrage of none, but the <HI>accuser of the Brethren,</HI> that <HI>Abaddon</HI> or<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 12. 10. 9. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Apollyon,</HI> so <HI>very skilfull to destroy, who is the Father of Lies,</HI> and was <HI>a murderer from the beginning.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 8. 14, 44.</NOTE></P>

in the mouths of <HI>some,</HI> whose very <HI>Tongues</HI> have <HI>Teeth,</HI> which <HI>bite</HI> much <HI>harder</HI> then I will ever allow <HI>mine,</HI> (and if there happen to be any in all my papers, I shall not think it <HI>painful</HI> to have them <HI>drawn</HI>) it is but needful that I be clothed at least with <HI>armour</HI> of <HI>defence.</HI> I meant indeed at the first, only to have <HI>armed</HI> my self with <HI>silence,</HI> that my <HI>reservednesse</HI> and <HI>obscurity</HI> might keep me <HI>safe:</HI> and even now that I am <HI>forced</HI> and as it were <HI>drag'd</HI> into the <HI>field,</HI> I contend not for <HI>victory,</HI> but for an <HI>honourable Retreat.</HI> And if after I have suffer'd, I may be <HI>competently safe,</HI> I will thank my <HI>Buckler,</HI> but not my <HI>Sword.</HI> Even now that I am <HI>writing,</HI> it is with a kinde of <HI>willingnesse</HI> to <HI>blot</HI> it <HI>out;</HI> and do only <HI>so</HI> do it, as preferring an <HI>in|convenience</HI> before a <HI>mischief.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. There had been a <HI>private conference</HI> betwixt a Gen|tleman and my self, which (for his further satisfaction) I threw hastily into a paper; every whit as <HI>incohaerent,</HI> as it had been in our <HI>oral</HI> and <HI>extemporary Discourses:</HI> a Discourse which of necessity was forc'd to be without <HI>method</HI> as without <HI>premeditation;</HI> because (in my <HI>an|swers</HI> to his <HI>objections</HI>) I was bound to <HI>follow</HI> after the measure that I was <HI>led.</HI> I thought the thing so <HI>incon|siderable,</HI> as not to vouchsafe it a <HI>reading over,</HI> but just as it was written, delivered it instantly to my friend, to be returned (when he had used it) unto the <HI>usual place of my forgetfulnesse.</HI> And forgotten it was so long, that truly I know not how long it was; till discoursing with another Gentleman upon the very same subject, I found my memory awak'd by that <HI>sleeping scribble;</HI> but (forgetting that <HI>secrets</HI> do cease to be so, when they are <HI>told</HI> though but to <HI>one,</HI> and
<PB N="3" REF="5">
that with strict conjurations of greatest <HI>secrecy</HI>) I gave him leave to peruse it as his leisure serv'd him. It seems this Gentleman had a <HI>Confident,</HI> as well as I; and so my <HI>original</HI> increas'd and multiplied into ma|ny false copies, of which <HI>not one</HI> was like the <HI>Mo|ther.</HI> Now that my paper went abroad by the help of more <HI>hands</HI> then one, was against my <HI>knowledge,</HI> against my <HI>will,</HI> against my <HI>precept,</HI> against my <HI>care,</HI> and lastly against my <HI>best endevours</HI> to <HI>recal</HI> it. It having been absolutely impossible, that I should love the <HI>publication</HI> of my <HI>poor Abortive,</HI> who never esteemed my <HI>ripest</HI> and most <HI>legitimate productions</HI> to be any way wor|thy of <HI>publique view.</HI> So far was I from an <HI>ambition</HI> of being known by a <HI>disfigured</HI> and <HI>mis shapen childe,</HI> that when I first heard of its <HI>travels,</HI> it was faln out of my <HI>memory;</HI> and when it came to me in a <HI>disguise,</HI> it was quite out of my <HI>knowledge.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. I do acknowledge the great <HI>abstrusenesse</HI> of the whole subject on which I treated, and the <HI>disproportion</HI> of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Episc. Winton. in Iud. de art.

Who</HI> am I, that I should <HI>moderate</HI> between the <HI>Remonstrants</HI> and <HI>Anti|remonstrants?</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="6">
betwixt S. <HI>Austin</HI> and <HI>other Fathers?</HI> betwixt <HI>him</HI> and <HI>himself?</HI> betwixt the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Dort,</HI> and that other at <HI>Augusta?</HI> betwixt the <HI>Dominicans</HI> and the <HI>Iesuites?

<P N="27">27.

<P N="28">28. My <HI>sixth Reason</HI> is taken from Christs having <HI>bought</HI> those very men (2 Pet. 2. 1.) <HI>whose damnation did not slumber.</HI> (vers. 3.)

But it is granted on all sides (as I suppose) that God will save <HI>none</HI> except <HI>such</HI> as are found to be in <HI>Christ</HI> with the aforesaid <HI>qualifications;</HI> and therefore it should be <HI>agreed</HI> on all sides, that he <HI>decreed</HI> to save <HI>none</HI> but <HI>such as they.</HI> And what is that but a <HI>respective</HI> and <HI>conditional</HI> Decree? made in <HI>intuition</HI> of our <HI>being</HI> in <HI>Christ,</HI> and of our being <HI>so qualified</HI> to be <HI>in Christ?</HI> So that although <HI>our election is not of works,</HI> but <HI>of him that calleth,</HI> yet <HI>good works</HI> are required as a <HI>necessary condition,</HI> though utterly unworthy to be a <HI>cause</HI> of <HI>our election.</HI> Nor can it be without respect to the <HI>condition</HI> of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> that the <HI>Covenant</HI> is <HI>made,</HI> and the <HI>promise decreed</HI> to be <HI>fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P N="56">56. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I consider, that the <HI>Decree</HI> of the <HI>Father</HI> to <HI>send</HI> the <HI>Son</HI> to be a <HI>second Adam,</HI> was in <HI>respect</HI> and <HI>regard</HI> to the <HI>backesli|ding</HI> of the <HI>first Adam.</HI> Without which it was <HI>impossible</HI> that the Son of God should have been sent to be the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the world. And the <HI>decree</HI> of God Almighty to save the <HI>first Adam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 1. 4, 6. Rom. 8. 39. 1 Cor. 5. 15.</NOTE> was in regard of and <HI>respect</HI> to the <HI>meritoriousness</HI> of the <HI>second Adam.</HI> For God <HI>adopteth</HI> never a <HI>childe,</HI> nor doth <HI>acknowledge</HI> him for <HI>his own,</HI> so as to give him <HI>eternal life,</HI> unlesse it be for the sake of his <HI>only begotten Son.</HI> First God <HI>pitied</HI> a <HI>woful world,</HI> then he <HI>loved</HI> what be <HI>pitied,</HI> next he <HI>gave</HI> his own <HI>Son</HI> to <HI>save</HI> what he
<PB N="70" REF="39">
<HI>loved,</HI> and upon the <HI>condition</HI> of <HI>beleeving in his Son,</HI> he gave it a promise of <HI>eternal life.</HI> For so <HI>beleeving</HI> is <HI>interposed</HI> be|twixt <HI>love</HI> and <HI>life,</HI> in the 3. of S. <HI>Iohn</HI> vers. 26. <HI>God so loved the world,</HI> that he gave his only <HI>begotten Son,</HI> that whoso|ever <HI>beleeveth in him,</HI> should not perish, but have <HI>everla|sting life.</HI> From this Text it appeareth, that God <HI>loved</HI> the <HI>world before</HI> he <HI>gave</HI> his <HI>Son</HI> to it; for <HI>therefore gave</HI> he his <HI>Son,</HI> because he <HI>loved</HI> it. But it was not a <HI>love</HI> by which he loved it to <HI>life everlasting;</HI> for with <HI>such love</HI> he only loved it in his <HI>Son.</HI> And the world is not capable of such a <HI>love</HI> without the <HI>condition</HI> of <HI>beleeving.</HI> It was therefore in prae|science of our <HI>beleeving in Christ,</HI> that God <HI>elected</HI> us to <HI>life eternal.</HI> For Christ is not <HI>only</HI> the <HI>means,</HI> (as some affirm) but the <HI>meritorious cause,</HI> and the <HI>Head</HI> of our <HI>Election. Christ was foreknown,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 2. and <HI>we in him, Rom.</HI> 8. 29. Christ was <HI>praedestin'd,</HI> and <HI>we by him, Eph.</HI> 1. 5.</P>
<P N="57">57. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> I consider, that there must be a <HI>Difference</HI> be|fore there can be an <HI>Election. Love</HI> indeed is an <HI>act</HI> of <HI>fa|vour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And from the nature of Ele|ction. <GAP DESC="foreign"> Oecum. apud Episc. Wint. de Artic. Lam. Iud.</NOTE> but <HI>Election</HI> is properly an <HI>act</HI> of <HI>Iudgement;</HI> a <HI>pre|ferring</HI> of the <HI>better</HI> before the <HI>worse.</HI> They that say God <HI>Elected</HI> such a number of men without the least <HI>intuition</HI> of their qualifications by which they are differenced from the <HI>reprobated crew,</HI> do speak <HI>illogically</HI> (to say no worse.) how much <HI>safer</HI> is it to say, That because such men as are <HI>in Christ by Faith</HI> are <HI>better</HI> then such as are <HI>out of Christ</HI> by <HI>Infidelity,</HI> therefore <HI>those</HI> are <HI>taken,</HI> and <HI>these</HI> are <HI>left?</HI> Nor doth this <HI>derogate</HI> from <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>arrogate</HI> to <HI>man,</HI> to say, he <HI>chooseth</HI> his own <HI>gifts,</HI> any more then it doth, to say, <HI>he crowns them.</HI> For God doth <HI>give</HI> us the <HI>advantage</HI> of our being <HI>in Christ,</HI> as well as <HI>choose</HI> us for that <HI>advan|tage.</HI> First he <HI>giveth</HI> us his <HI>Son,</HI> next he giveth us his <HI>Grace</HI> whereby to <HI>enable</HI> us to <HI>believe</HI> in his <HI>Son,</HI> and <HI>so beleeving</HI> he doth <HI>elect</HI> us. So that here is no <HI>matter</HI> for man to <HI>boast</HI> on; he having <HI>nothing</HI> which he hath not <HI>re|ceived,</HI> no not so much as his <GAP DESC="foreign"> It is <HI>God</HI> that <HI>makes</HI> the <HI>difference,</HI> as well as <HI>God</HI> that <HI>chooseth.</HI> And it seems this very argument from the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Use</HI> of the word <HI>Election,</HI> did prevail with S. <HI>Austin</HI> and <HI>Oecume|nius.</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="39" MS="y">

<P N="58">58. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> I consider, that the whole <HI>Tenor</HI> of the <HI>Scri|ptures,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proved by Scripture.</NOTE> in the <HI>Iudgement</HI> of <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Fathers,</HI> who are best able to <HI>understand them,</HI> teacheth no other <HI>Praedestination,</HI> then <HI>in,</HI> and <HI>through Christ,</HI> which is <HI>respective</HI> and <HI>condi|tional.</HI> First the Scripture gives us none but <HI>conditional pro|mises,</HI> such as, <HI>If any man keep my saying, he shall never taste</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 8. 51.

Nay even the ve|ry Texts which are wont to be urged for <HI>irrespective Ele|ction</HI> do seem very precisely to <HI>evince</HI> the <HI>contrary.</HI> For when God is said to <HI>praedestine</HI> according to <HI>his good pleasure</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 9.</NOTE> <HI>which he had purposed in himself,</HI> the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> rendred <HI>good pleasure,</HI> doth not signifie the <HI>absolutenesse,</HI> but the <HI>re|spectivenesse</HI> of his <HI>will.</HI> For it <HI>relateth</HI> to something in which God is <HI>well pleased,</HI> and that is <HI>Christ.</HI> It being im|possible for God to <HI>please himself</HI> with <HI>mankinde,</HI> or for <HI>men</HI> to be <HI>acceptable</HI> and <HI>well pleasing</HI> to God, any otherwise then in <HI>him,</HI> of whom it was said, <HI>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.</HI> Besides, <HI>all</HI> those <HI>Scriptures</HI> which do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> teach <HI>universal Grace,</HI> and <HI>Redemption,</HI> (which I suppose hath been <HI>proved</HI> in the prosecution of my <HI>first Principle</HI>) do seem to me most clearly to inferre a <HI>respective</HI> and <HI>conditional Election.</HI> For if it is true, that Christ did offer up himself, not only <HI>sufficiently,</HI> but <HI>intentionally</HI> for all; if he did <HI>ear|nestly desire</HI> that <HI>every one</HI> would <HI>come in,</HI> upon the preach|ing of his <HI>Word,</HI> and receive the benefit of his <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Pas|sion;</HI> if his <HI>warnings</HI> were not in <HI>jest,</HI> and his <HI>invitations se|rious;</HI> if [<HI>depart from me ye cursed</HI>] was therefore <HI>foretold,</HI> that every one might <HI>beware</HI> and not <HI>obtrude</HI> himself upon that <HI>sentence;</HI> if he is <HI>unwilling</HI> that any one should be
