And for because I pon dered the obliuion of mortall memory and vngratefulnesse of nature in suche thinges as notwithstandinge be to hys proper commoditie, I haue renewed herein, and haue sette before your eyes such necessary precepts of liuing &amp; rules of wise experience as you haue read and perused before time: to the ende that by more perusing you may print the same in youre heart, that it also may beare

fruits in your life, and waying wel you may perceaue that no knowledge is so requisite or needefull as morall philoso|phy, which not onely disseuereth the na|ture of man from beastly brutish kynd, &amp; bewtifies &amp; adornes the sense and rate+fies the life: but also teacheth &amp; instruc|teth to auoyd inconuenience &amp; mischefe, &amp; leadeth the soule to the fauour of God. Wherfore finding this most meete for you and easyest for me to attayne, I haue ben bolde to offer you this same, as a token of my well wishing: Supposing me not needfull for to craue your pacience, be|cause I am assured of your gen|tlenes.</P>

dutyes, but rather requy|reth to be co~tinually put in reme~bra~ce of the same, &amp; this is the cause which hathe imboldeued me to tra~slate these worthy say ings of y^e wise into verse, wherby thou mightest be the soner moued to peruse them, as also the more ef|fectually &amp; redely to print the~ in thy thought, wher|in I craue thy gentle pa|cience, and if oughte be a|misse it shalbe reformed.</P>
