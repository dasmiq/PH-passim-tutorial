<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THere bee two things necessarie for
this life, <HI>Foode</HI> and <HI>Raiment.</HI> For
<HI>Rayment</HI> you have much travailed to
the publike good, by adding to our <HI>Olde
Draperies,</HI> the making of <HI>Perpetuanaes, Spa|nish
Cloathes, &amp;c.</HI> And lastly, by bringing
<HI>Rape Oyle</HI> to the use of Cloathing: where|by
you have exceedingly well deserved of
the Common-wealth. For <HI>Food,</HI> that other
and greater necessary, <HI>The Newe Invention
for Fertiling and Inriching of Areable Grounds,</HI>
the Argument of the ensuing Treatise, must
acknowledge you as the <HI>first Author;</HI> So to
have beene by your selfe, and others by you
directed, the prime <HI>Experimentors</HI> of the cer|taintie
and realitie thereof: Then which, I
<PB REF="2">
scarsely know, whether any thing hath bene
Invented of more great and generall use. Yet
have you not so busied your selfe about many
things with <HI>Martha,</HI> as to neglect that one
necessary of necessaries, <HI>Maries</HI> good part,
which hath the blessing of both lives: which
your often praying, frequent hearing, much
reading, and meditating of the best things,
well testifie: But hereof enough. This <HI>Booke
of Direction,</HI> being your owne, and for the
maine, framed out of your tryed directi|ons,
desires to passe into the world un|derthe
protection of your credit, and name:
Vntill by approved experience it shall have
gained credit unto it selfe, and returned credit
unto you; meane while, it shall rest conten|ted
with that olde <HI>Motto:</HI></P>

<HEAD>A DIRECTION TO THE

Areable Grounds, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_WHereas the Kings Ma|jestie,
vpon the humble Petiti|on
of <HI>Charles Mowet, Ed|ward
Keeling,</HI> and <HI>Natha|nael
Waterhouse</HI> Gent' on the
behalfe of themselues, and part|ners,
by His Letters Patents vnder the Great
Seale of England, bearing date at <HI>Westminster</HI>
the first day of <HI>March,</HI> in the ninth yeare of his
Raigne, of his especiall grace, certaine knowledge,
and meere motion, Hath given, and granted for
him, his Heires, and Successors, vnto the said
<HI>Charles Mowet, Edward Keeling,</HI> and <HI>Na|thanael

Waterhouse,</HI> full and free Libertie, Li|cence,

Yeares next ensuing the Date of the said Letters

within His Kingdomes of <HI>England, Ireland,</HI> and
<HI>Dominion of Wales,</HI> at every of their wills,

of fertiling and inriching of Areable Grounds, by
a mixture in a smale quantitie, of certaine native
Materialls with the Seed; farther signifying that
His will and pleasure was, and by the said Letters
Patents, of His more especiall grace, certain know|ledge,
and meere motion, for Him, his Heires and
Successors, straitly charging and inhibiting all and
every other Person &amp; Persons whatsoever, of what

directly or indirectly the said Art, way or meanes
for fertiling and inriching of Areable Grounds,
without the Licence, Consent, and agreement of
them the said Patentees, their Executors, Admi|nistrators,
or Assignes, or some, or one of them,
first had and obtained; And hath by the said Let|ters
Patents for Him, his Heires, and Successors,
willed and commanded all and singuler Majors,
Sheriffes, Iustices of Peace, Bayliffes, Constables,
Headboroughes, and other Ministers and Sub|iects
of Him, his Heires and Successors, that they
and every of them, be from time to time during the
terme aforesaid, helping and assisting to the said
Patentees, the Survivor and Survivors of them,
their and every of their Executors, Administra|tors,
Deputies, and Assignes, in all things in and
about the accomplishment of His pleasure therein
declared, and in the exercise and execution of the
same; And that they nor any of them doe at any
time hinder, molest, or interrupt the said Paten|tees,
or the Survivor or Survivors of them, their
or any of their Executors, Administrators, De|puties,
<PB REF="4">
or Assignes, or any of them, in any wife
concerning the Premises, as they tender His plea|sure,
and would avoid the contrary at their perill,
as in and by the said Letters Patents more at
large appeareth.</P>
<P>In which Letters Pattents, the particuler
naming of the said Materialls, the Preparati|ons
of them, the proportions, and manner of
mixture, and application of them, aswell to
the Seed, as to the Ground, and many other
incidents, were wittingly omitted, as reser|ved
to the ensuing discourse, purposely in|tended
for a full Direction of the Husband|man
in the use, exercise, and practise of the
said new Invention.</P>
<P>Wherin although the Composition, here|after
described consist of ingredients, endow|ed
with qualities so specificall, and powerful,
in the fruitfulling and inriching of Areable
Grounds; and the manner of application ther|of
both to the Seed, and Ground, so proper
for the endeaymed at; as it might well hope
upon the very reading of the same, to gaine
beliefe amongst the ingenious and judicious
<PB REF="4">
Husbandmen, without further proofe; yet
because many things in discourse, and reason
so concluding, as convince most understan|dings,
fall out oftentmes to faile in the prac|tise,
it desireth no further faith or acceptance
from any, then such, as a Demonstrative, ex|perimented
successefull truth shall wrest from
the most incredulous.</P>
<P>Which experiment that it may bee made
without any the least error or mistaking, the
Instructions following are set downe in such
plainenesse, and so distinctly in the materials,
preparation, proportion, applycation, and all
other requisite particulers, as none (not too
carelesly negligent) can possibly erre.</P>
<P>FIrst then, the Soyle being supposed to bee
such, as with the vsuall Husbandries of
Dunging, Marleing, Lyming, Foulding, &amp;c.
will returne in some good measure in his sea|son
a multiplyed Cropp of the Graine therein
sowed; you must give unto it the ordinary
Tillage, according to the Nature of the Sone,
and use of the Countrey.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">Your Seed being <HI>Wheat, Rye, Barley,</HI> or of
what other sort soever, must be well chosen,
and cleansed from light Corne, and whatso|else
mixture of any Damagefull thing, with
an abatement of the fourth part of the Seed,
you usually gave in your former courses of
Husbandry, and yet you shall (by the bles|sing
of God) finde your Corne as thicke and
strong, as if you had given the whole propor|tion
of Seed.</P>
<P>Vpon every Bushell of <HI>Winchester</HI> mea|sure,
containing eight Gallons, being laid up|on
a Table or Course sheete Bedwise, powre
(as on a Bed of Wooll) so much of Rape|seede
Oyle, as will well moysten the said
Seede, stirring and tossing the Corne so oyled
to and fro, untill it bee well moistned and
made fit to receiue and joyne it selfe with a|ny
drie matterialls, which shal be added ther|to,
in Flower or powders.</P>
<P>A Bushell of seede will take about a quart
of Oyle.</P>
<P><PB REF="5" MS="y">Then take one Quart of the Flower of
Beanes, being first M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ulted. One quart of the
powder of Rapeseede Cakes after the Oy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e is
pressed out; One quart of burnt Lyme new
from the Kilne, quenched with Vrine, and
sifted; or so much of each of them in equall
parts, as may well cover and encompasse the
said Seede.</P>
<P>The Flower and Powders aforesaid must
bee very well stirred and mingled together
one with another, which done, strow them
upon your Bushell of Oyled Corne, tumbling
and tossing them and the graine one with
another, or shaking them togeather upon
the saide course sheet, untill the Corne have
licked upp, and united it selfe with the
Flower and Powders, which will soone bee
done.</P>
<P>Your Seede thus ordered, and (as it were)
clothed with the Flower and Powders a|foresaid,
may presently bee sowed, or kept
unsowed, Ten, Fifteene, or Twenty dayes,
<PB REF="6">
before it will growe, or take other harme,
as hath beene tryed.</P>
<P>In, on after your sowing, if your ground be
poore, and you have plenty of the said drie
Materialls, you may strowe or throwe upon
one Acre of Ground about two Bushels more
or lesse of the said Flower and Powders, as
you conceive your Ground better or worse.</P>
<P>This mixture aforesaid, imployed as here
described with the Seede, and upon the
Ground, will really alone performe the in|tention
without any further addition, as hath
beene often experienced.</P>
<P>But that the Husbandman may bee fully
furnished with all such experimented helpes,
as tend to this end. And because, for the pre|sent,
there may bee in some places want of
the said Materialls, or some of them; let him
further know, that in lieu of them (though
not so powerfull) may be used the materi|alls
following.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">As in want of the Oyle, you may use so
much of the strongest Woort.</P>
<P>In stead of the Flower of Beanes, so much
of the Flower of Barley Mault ground very
small; and for your Powder of Rape Oyle
Cakes, as much of the powder of Pigeons
dung dried and sifted, or of the powder of
Sheepes Turdles drie: or so much of your
Kilp Ashes, or Berillia, where it may bee had;
or so much of Pot Ashes; or where Woad is
set for dying of Wooll, so much of Woad past
drie and brought into Powder: these in e|quall
proportions mingled all or some of
them, with all or some of the former first de|scribed
Flower and Powders, may be succes|fully
used, either in the dressing of the Oyled
Seede, or in the strowing the ground sowed
therewith, as aforesaid. But the Sheepes Tur|dles
must be thus prepared.</P>
<P>Take so much of the said Turdles as you
purpose to use, and lay them bedwise in such
a thickenesse, as being moistened lightly with
Vrine, it may gather a heate, and grow incli|nable
<PB REF="7">
to Putrefaction or Rottennesse; and so
let it rest, untill it become somewhat drie.
Then with a Rake, or some other fitting in|strument,
stirre and tosse your bedd well, and
being againe layd Bedwise, moysten it with
Vrine as before, and let it so rest untill it
grow againe drie: then stirre and tosse it a|gaine,
and lay it as before Bedwise, and moi|sten
it with Vrine. So continuing from time
to time this course of moistning, drying, and
stirring the said Bedd, untill the Turdles bee
throughly putrifyed and rotten; so as they
fall into powder: then let them drie, and
take the powder for your use. The elder
and more rotten the Turdles bee, the more
effectually they worke.</P>
<P>So much of the aforesaid Materialls as bee
necessary, are every where to be had, though
in some parts further of, and dearer then in
other.</P>
<P>That which may seeme most difficult to
be got in some places, is the Rape Oyle and
Rape Cakes, which yet by the late disper|sing
<PB REF="7">
of that Husbandry into most Shires, is
not hard to bee had. But if it be found any
where lacking, any wealthy Husbandman
may (hiring of a servant from some of the
Oyle Workes) Convert some of his Greene|sword
to that use, and so furnish himselfe,
and neighbours aboundantly, and cheape,
and to his owne very great profit; and in the
meane time, some other of the former Ingre|dients
may be used in stead thereof.</P>
<P>And this may suffice for Direction.</P>
<P>The skilfull Husbandman by what hath
beene said, will take occasion as experience
shall guide him, to fit and accommodate
things, as hee shall finde most behoofefull,
though now and then varying from what is
formerly prescribed.</P>
<P>There bee sundrie other Materialls which
are knowne to be of great force in the fruit|fulling
of Areable Grounds; and might bee
easily drawne to this imployment, where|unto
the former Flowers, Ashes, and Pow|ders
bee applyed. But because these are to
<PB REF="8">
be had but in small proportions, and but in
fewe places, they are purposely omitted, as
not answering the vniversalitie of this In|tention.</P>
<P>There be other moystures to supply that
of Rape Oyle, or of the Woort, for moyste|ning
the Seede, and other Ashes and Pow|ders
for cloathing the Seede, and strowing
upon the Ground, which prepared accor|ding
to Art, are upon no light prosumpti|ons,
conceived as powerfull in fruitfulling
and inriching Areable Grounds, as the other
formerly named: But because as yet they
have not beene so farre, and fully experi|mented,
as to be offered as a certaintie, their
mention is now forborne; but shall (God
willing) upon some further tryalls, be com|municated
for the publicke good.</P>
<P>Although by that which hath before been
said by way of Direction in this new Course
of Manuring, the Husbandman cannot but
observe many benefits arising thereby, above
those growing by the ordinary Tillages vsed;
<PB REF="8">
yet shall it not be amisse to say something in
particular of that also.</P>
<P>In this way, the trouble of Foulding, the
labour of carrying great quantities of Dung,
Lyme, Marle, &amp;c. and the spreading thereof
is spared, and the fetching of some of them
divers myles, and at great prices; Whereas
the quantities of these Materialls used in this
way are so small, as will cost little, and so
light as the carriage will be easie, and the ap|plying
them to the Seede and ground, askes
little more trouble then the very sowing of
the Seede it selfe.</P>
<P>The Dunging, Foulding, Marling, Ly|ming,
&amp;c. formerly bestowed upon the Ara|ble
Grounds, may now be converted to the
fruitfulling of the Greenesword.</P>
<P>A fourth part of your Seed is saved, which
will neere, if not wholly, countervaile the
charge of the Materialls.</P>
<P>The Flowers, Ashes, and Powders encom|passing
<PB REF="9">
the Seed, moistened as aforesaid, de|fendeth
it from the devouring of Fowle, Mise,
Wormes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The poorer sort, who want Cattell to
breed, and money to buy Soyle, shall in this
course, with little or no charge supply that
want.</P>
<P>In this husbandrie, you may Sow the same
Ground every yeare, and so spare the more to
Meadow and Pasture.</P>
<P>Besides the generall good to the Common
wealth, it will better all Tythes of Graine,
to the benefit of Incumbents, and others to
whom the Tythes be due.</P>
<P>A fewe yeares experience will (no doubt)
bring to light many other Commodities ari|sing
by this invention, not now thought of,
but for the present these may serve.</P>
<P>For Conclusion, when you have care|fully
and exactly followed the Directions
<PB REF="9">
aforesaid, and (it may be) in some things bet|tered
them, take heed you doe not so depend
upon these outward meanes, though never so
good, as to forget the Cause of Causes.</P>
