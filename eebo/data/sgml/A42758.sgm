<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is high time for those who have been long praying for the peace of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and with bleeding hearts have beheld the sorrowes of <HI>Sion,</HI> now to be|stirre themselves with an extraordinary diligence, and to contribute their most serious and uncessant endeavours, for the setling of these present commotions about Church affairs, in such a manner, that the sacred twins, <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> may both cohabit under own roofe&punc; and that this great and good work of Reformation may not be blasted in the bird, nor fade in the flourish, but may be brought forward to that full maturity, which shall afford a har|vest of joy to us, and to all the Churches of God.</P>
<P>One controversie there is about the government of the Church, and it is of such consequence, that were it well resolved upon, and rightly agreed, it should facilitate a right resolution in other matters which are in question. Now because <HI>longum iter per praecepta, breve per exempla, the way is long by precepts, short by platforms</HI>; therefore I have carefully observed the policie and government of o|ther reformed Churches. And because the nearnesse of relation swayeth my affection at least half a thought more unto that which is <HI>Scotlands (caeteris paribus)</HI> then unto that which is more remote from us, therfore I was most so|licitous to see a delineation of the government of that fa|mously reformed neighbor Church; w^c^h when I had read, &amp; read over again, I did conclude with my self, that if these two points at which most exception is taken, I mean the office of ruling Elders, and the authoritie of Presbyters and Synodes, which also are things common to the other
<PB REF="3">
reformed Churches) could be upon good grounds main|tained, there is no other thing of any moment to be ob|jected against it.</P>
<P>And with these thoughts I was so tossed, that I could not rest satisfied with the <HI>Quid</HI> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hout the <HI>Quare,</HI> but did conceive as great languor and desire for a <HI>demonstra|tion</HI> of that form of Church government, as before I had for a <HI>declaration</HI> of the same. Whereupon I have purcha|sed to my self from <HI>Scotland</HI> this ensuing Treatise which having fully satisfied my owne minde in the asserting of those most controverted points, I have resolved to com|municate and publish the same unto others, for the reasons following.</P>
<P>First, for the satisfaction of such as do through igno|rance or mistaking stumble at such a form of Ecclesiasti|call government: I do not much marvell to see those that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of a simple understanding, so far conquered, as to scru|ple the office of ruling Elders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop Hall his assertion of E|piscopacie by Divine right.</NOTE> having heard the big words and lavish expressions of some opposites against the same; yet a poor peece it is which one of them would usher in with a tinckling Epistle, in which
<Q>Projicit ampullas &amp; sesquipedalia verba.</Q>
He maketh offer to forfeit his life to justice, and his re|putation to shame; if any living man can shew that e|ver there was a ruling Elder in the Christian world, till <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rell,</HI> and <HI>Viret</HI> first created them. I shall not desire to take him at his word for his life, but if he be not able to give a satisfactory answer unto that which is here sayd both from Scripture, and from antiquity for ruling El|ders, then hath he given sentence against his own reputa|tion for ever. And so much the more, that having in that assertion of Episcopacie boldly averred,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ag.</HI> 208.209.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.</NOTE> that the name of the Elders of the Church, in all antiquity compre|hendeth none but Preachers and Divines; and that ther|fore none but they may be called <HI>Seniores Ecclesiae,</HI> though some others happily may have the title of <HI>Seniores populi,</HI>
<PB REF="3">
because of their civill authority; notwithstanding the reading of the observations of <HI>Iustellus,</HI> and of both the <HI>Cassaubons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 146.</NOTE> hath now so farre changed his tone, that in his late answer to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mectymnuus,</HI> he acknowledgeth that beside Pastors and Doctors, and beside the Magistrates or Elders of the Cities, there are to be found in antiquity, <HI>Seniores Ecclesiastici,</HI> Ecclesiasticall Elders also; only he alleadgeth they were but as our Church-wardens, or ra|ther as our Vestry-men: whereas indeed they were Judges in Ecclesiasticall controversies, and (in some sort) instru|ctors of the people, as shall be made to appeare&punc; Meane while we do observe what trust is to be given to this bold Speaker, who hath beene forc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to yeeld, what he had be|fore with high swelling words denied.</P>
<P>Another Instance of the same kinde is to be noted in his Remonstrance, when he speaketh of the prescript forms of prayer, which the Jewish Church had ever from the dayes of <HI>Moses,</HI> wherewith also <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> when they went up into the Temple at the ninth hour of Pray|er did joyn;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 11.</NOTE> to make good his allegiance, he addeth, <HI>the forms whereof are yet extant and ready to be produced.</HI> Yet this he handsomely eateth up in his defence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 17.18.</NOTE> where he gives us to understand, that those set forms of prayer are indeed specified by <HI>Capellus,</HI> a writer of our owne Age; but that the book it selfe which contained these prayers, is perished a thousand years ago. Well, he is now con|tent to say that once those forms were extant; and this (forsooth) he will prove from a certain Samaritan Chro|nicle in the custodie of his faithfull friend the Primate of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mach</HI>; wherein he hath found a story which transpor|teth him as much as the invention of the demonstration did <HI>Archimedes,</HI> when he cried <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>I have found it, I have found it.</HI> Yet&mdash;<HI>cred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Iudaeus apella, Non ego</HI>&mdash;But this lyeth not now in my way. Only (till a full answer be ready, I thought it not amisse to give some taste of the mans vaine arrogant humour, whose best
<PB REF="4">
weapons are great words. As for his last record which he fetcheth from <HI>Abrahamus Scultetus,</HI> against ruling El|ders; all that and much more hath been, and here shall be abundantly confuted.</P>
<P>Others there be who call in question the power and authority of Ecclesiasticall Presbyteries, and of Synods, against which also some few Pens have been put to paper and have passed a censure no lesse hard then unseasonable, which (me thinks) might well have been spared, unlesse: there had been stronger and more convincing reasons for it. These I shall beseech, that with minds voyd of preju|dice, they take into consideration the second part of this Treatise, written with no heat nor sharpnesse of words, but with plainnesse, and strength of reason: And withall I shall expect that they will not think the worse of the Author, for being ready to answer him that asketh a rea|son of him, or for writing a justification of the govern|ment of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to such as did desire to be more throughly resolved concerning the same; but that rather they will make use hereof, as a key by divine Providence put into their hands, to open a doore unto further light.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is so much the more reason for asserting those two points, by how much they have beene mainly opposed by Sathan; for he it was whose cunning convey|ance of old, made the office of ruling Elders to come into dessuetude, through the sloth, or rather the pride of the Teachers, as <HI>Ambrose</HI> complaineth; and yet time hath not so obliterate that ancient order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In 1 Tim. 5.</NOTE> but that the footsteps of the same are yet to be seen in our Officialls, Chancel|lors, Commissaries, Church-wardens, and High-Com|mission men, yea at <HI>Rome</HI> it selfe, in the Cardinalls. The same old Serpent it was whose instigation made <HI>Licinius</HI> whiles he did intend the totall ruine of the Church, to fall upon this as the most effectuall means for his purpose, that he should straightly inhibit all counsells, meetings,
<PB REF="4">
and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erencies concerning the affairs of the Church. By which meanes the Christians of his time were drawne into one of two snares. <HI>Aut enim legem, &amp;c. for</HI> saith <HI>Eusebius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De vit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Const. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 44.</NOTE> <HI>either it behoved us to be obnoxious to punishment by violating the Law, or to overthrow the Rites and Ordi|nances of the Church, by giving obedience in that which the Law did command: for great and waighty deliberations undertaken about things controverted, cannot proceed in any other manner or way, but by the right managing of Councels.</HI> The <HI>Arminians</HI> in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> found out another of Sathans wiles; they were not able to hinder the assemb|ling of a free and lawfull Synod, but for their next best, they required of the Synod of <HI>Dort</HI> twelve conditions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide actae Syno. Dord. Sess.</HI> 25.</NOTE> and the ninth was; that there should not be in that Synod any determination or decree concerning the matters in controversie, but only an accommodation or conference, and that still it should be free to the particular Churches, to accept, or to reject the judgement of the Synod: this was a way of endlesse controversie, and justly cried down in the Synod.</P>
<P>Moreover, Satan ever wise in his own principles, find|ing the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> like an invincible <HI>Sampson,</HI> by reason of such a constitution and gove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nment, as being preserved in integritie, could neither admit heresie, nor schisme, did make use of the Prelacie as his traiterous <HI>Da|lilah,</HI> to betray that <HI>Sampson,</HI> into the hands of the now adverse <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilistines</HI> the Papists, by stealing away both their ruling Elders, and the authority of their Presbyteries, and Synods: for he had well observed, that in these two things did their great strength lye, and that without these two, the Ministers of the Word being like so many <HI>scopae dissolut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> both sparsed, and by themselves alone might easily be brought under the yoke. When thus the Ro|mish-affected <HI>Dalilah</HI> had taken away their strength from them, she was bold to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r her insulting voice in the Ser|vice-book, and book of Canons, The <HI>Philistines</HI> be upon
<PB REF="5">
thee <HI>Sampson,</HI> The Papists be upon thee <HI>Scotland.</HI> In this case they did not (as <HI>Sampson</HI> then) presume that the Lord was with them as at other times; they knew he was de|parted from them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 80 14 15.</NOTE> They cried out, <HI>Return we beseech thee O God of Hosts, look down from Heaven, behold and visit this Vine, and the Vineyeard which thine own right hand hath planted.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er. 50.5.</NOTE> They did again <HI>ask the way to Sion with their fa|ces thitherward, saying come, and let us joyn our selves to the Lord in a perpetuall Covenant that shall not be forgotten.</HI> And now (glory be to the great Name of God, in the Church throughout all generations) they have by his healing hand quickly recovered their strength.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whittak contr.</HI> 3. <HI>de concil. quaest</HI> 1.</NOTE> Strength I may well call it, for sayth a learned Divine, as in things which are done by bodily strength, so in things which are mana|ged by counsells, <HI>vis unita fortior,</HI> power being put to|gether is the stronger: and in this he doth agree with <HI>Bellarm.</HI>; that though God by his absolute power can pre|serve his Church without Synods; yet according to ordi|nary providence, they are necessary for the right govern|ment of the Church. The interweaving and combining of strength, by joyning the ruling Elders of every Con|gregation, with the Pastor, or Pastors thereof into a par|ticular Eldership, by joyning also Commissioners, Pa|stors, and E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ders, from many particular Elderships, ordi|narily into a classicall Presbytery, and more solemnly pro|vinciall Synod.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 6.4&punc;</NOTE> Finally, by joyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng Commissioners, Pa|stors, and Elders&punc; from many classicall PPresbyteries, into a Nationall Assembly; this doth indeed make a Church <HI>beautifull as Tirza, comely as Ierusalem, terrible as an Ar|mie with Banners.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to be expected, but this forme of Church go|vernment, shall still be disliked by some (whose dislike shall notwithstanding the more commend it to all pious minds) I mean by prophane men, who escape not with|out censure under Presbyteries, and Synods, as they did under the Prelacie; by hereticks, who cannot finde fa|vour
<PB REF="5">
with a Nationall Synod of many learned and godly&punc; men, as they did with a few Popish Prelats: by Matcha|vellians also, who do foresee that Presbyteriall Synodicall government, being conformed not to the Lesbian rule of humane authority, but to the inflexible rule of Divine Institution, will not admit of any Innovations in Reli|gion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 64 3.</NOTE> be they never so conduceable to politicall in|tentions.</P>
<P>Some there be <HI>who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bowes to shoot their arrows, even bitter words.</HI> They would wound both the office of ruling Elders, and the authority of Presbyteries and Synods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 22.21.</NOTE> with this hate|ful imputation, that they are in consistent with the honor and Prerogative of Princes. Sure I am, when our Savi|our saith, <HI>Render unto C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esar the things which are Caesars, and unto God the things which are Gods</HI>; he doth plainly insinuate, that the things which are Gods, need not to hinder the things which are Caesars. And why shall it be forgotten, that the Prelates did assume to themselves all that power of determining controversies; making Ca|nons, ordaining, suspending, deposing, and excommu|nicating, which now Presbyteries and Synods do claime as theirs by right. To me it appeareth a grand mistery, and worthy of deliberation in the wise Consistory of <HI>Rome:</HI> That the power of Presbyteries and Synods be|ing meerly Ecclesiasticall, being rightly used, and no|thing incroaching upon the civill power, is notwithstand|ing an intollerable prejudice to Kings and Princes. But the very same power in Prelates, though both abused, and mixed with civill power, is not (for a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l that prejudiciall to Soveraignty.</P>
<P>Yet if the fear of God cannot moli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie the tongues of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se men, one would think that they should be brideled with respect to the Kings most excellent Majestie, who hath been gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iously pleased to approve and ratifie the present government of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> perceiving (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB REF="6">
tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">) that Gods honour, and his honour, Gods Lawes, and his Lawes may well subsist together.</P>
<P>Lastly, as in publishing this assertion I intend to satisfie the scrupulous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 14 23.</NOTE> and to put to silence the malicious; so also to confirm the consciences of such as are friends and savourers to the right way of Church government. <HI>What|soever is not of faith i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sin,</HI> saith the Apostle, yea though it be in a matter otherwise indifferent: how much more is it necessary that we halt not in our judgement concerning the government of the Church, but walk straight, in the plerophory and full assurance of the same, from the war|rants of the word of God; I say againe from the war|rants of the word of God, for as it is not my meaning to commend this forme because it is <HI>Scotlands,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 1.9.</NOTE> so I hope assuredly that my Country-men will not dispise Gods Ordinance, because it is <HI>Scotlands</HI> practice, but rather follow them in so far as they follow Christ and the Scrip|ture. This therefore I pray,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the words Elder, Lay Elder, Ruling Elder.</HEAD>
<P>_THE word <HI>Elder</HI> answe|reth to <HI>Zaken</HI> in the He|brew, &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the Greek. It hath foure dif|ferent significations, 1. It noteth Age. 2&punc; Antiqui|ty. 3. Venerability. 4. An office. In the first signification, <HI>Elder</HI> is op|posed to younger, as 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.1. <HI>Rebuke not an
<PB N="2" REF="10">
Elder, but intreat him as a father, &amp; the younger men as brethren,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.5. <HI>Likewise ye youn|ger submit your selves unto the Elder.</HI> In this sense was the Apostle <HI>Iohn</HI> called <HI>the Elder,</HI> because hee outlived the other Apostles, 2 <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. and 3. vers. 1. In the second signifi|cation <HI>Elder</HI> is opposed to <HI>Moderne, Mat.</HI> 15.2. <HI>Why doe thy Disciples transgresse the tradi|tion of the Elders.</HI> That is, <HI>of them of old time, Mat.</HI> 5.21. In the third signification we finde the word, <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. where the Lord saith, that he would take away from Israel <HI>the prudent and the ancient, vezaken</HI>; that is, the worthies among them, and such as were respected for wisedome. The same word, (and peradver|ture in the same sense) is turned Elder, Exod. 2.16. <HI>Eth-zikne Israel, the Elders of Israel.</HI> So the Spanish <HI>Seijor,</HI> the French <HI>Seigneur,</HI> the Italian <HI>Signore,</HI> all comming from the Latine <HI>Senior,</HI> signifie a man of respect, or one ve|nerable for dignity, gifts, prudence, or piety. Contrariwise, men of no worth, nor wise|dome, men despicable for lacke of gifts and understanding, are called <HI>Children,</HI> Isa. 3.4.12. Ephes. 4.14. But it is the fourth signifi|cation which we have now to do withall, and so an Elder is a spirituall officer, appoin|ted by God, and called to the government of the Church, Acts 14.23. <HI>When they had
<PB N="3" REF="10">

<P>Before we come to speake particularly of those Elders of which our purpose is to treat, it is fit we should know them by their right name, lest wee nick-name and mis-call them. Some reproachfully and others ignorantly call them Lay Elders. But the distinction of the Clergie &amp; Laity, is Popish and Antichri|stian; and they who have narrowly conside|red the records of ancient times, have noted this distinction as one of the grounds whence the mystery of iniquity had the beginning of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Catal. test. verit. lib. 2. col. 98.

It is found by experience, that sinne and scandall are never well taken neede to, and redressed, where ruling Elders are not.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the function of Ruling Elders, and what sort of Officers they be.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 4. dist. 4.</NOTE>NOtwithstanding, of all the multiplicity of Popish orders, yet <HI>Peter Lombard</HI> treading the vestiges of the primitive simpli|city, did observe that the Apostles left only two sacred orders to bee perpetuall in the Church, the order of Deacons, &amp; the order of Elders. The administration of Deacons is exercised about things bodily. The ad|ministration of Elders about things spirituall. The former about the goods: the latter a|bout the government of the Church. Now Elders are of three sorts. 1. Preaching Elders, or Pastors. 2. Teaching Elders or Doctors. 3. Ruling Elders. All these are Elders, be|cause they have voice in Presbyteries, and all assemblies of the Church, and the govern|ment of the Church is incumbent to them all: nor onely to the Pastor and Elder, but to the Doctor also. The Bishop of <HI>Dune</HI> in his <HI>examen conjurationis Scoticae,</HI> p. 35. alledgeth, that our Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> did never yet determine whether Doctors and Deacons have right of voycing in the Consistories &amp;
<PB N="9" REF="13">
Assemblies of the Church. But had he read our booke of Policie, hee might have found, that it excludeth Deacons from being mem|bers of Presbyteries and Assemblies, Cap. 8. but admitteth Doctors into the same, Cap. 5. <HI>The Doctor being an Elder, as said is, should as|sist the Pastor in the government of the Kirke; and concurre with the Elders, his brethren, in all Assemblies, by reason the Interpretation of the Word, which is onely Iudge in Ecclesiasticall matters, is committed to his charge.</HI> But they differ, in that the Pastor laboureth in the word of exhortation, that is, by the gift of wisedome applieth the word to the manners of his flocke, and that in season and out of season, as he knoweth their particular cases to require. The Doctor laboureth in the word of Doctrine, that is, without such applicati|ons as the Pastor useth, by simple teaching he preserveth the truth and sound interpreta|tion of the Scriptures, against all heresie and error. The ruling Elder doth neither of these, but laboureth in the government and policie of the Church onely. The Apostle hath distinguished these three sorts of El|ders, 1. Tim. 5.17. <HI>Let Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the Word and Doctrine.</HI> Where, as <HI>Beza</HI> noteth, hee distinguisheth <HI>the Word,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="14">
which is the Pastors part, from <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which is the Doctors part. Even as Rom. 12.7.8. hee distinguisheth teaching from exhor|tation: and 1 Cor. 12.8. putteth <HI>the word of wisedome,</HI> and <HI>the word of knowledge</HI> for two different things. Now beside those Elders which labour in the Word, and those which labour in Doctrine, <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh to <HI>Timothy</HI> of a third sort of Elders, which labour nei|ther in the Word nor Doctrine, but in ruling well. Hence it appeareth, how truely the Booke of Policie, Cap. 2. saith, That there are foure ordinary, perpetuall, and necessary Offices in the Church, the office of the Pa|stor, the Doctor, the Elder, and the Deacon: and that no other office, which is not one of these foure, ought to bee received, or suffered in the Church.</P>
<P>But when we speake of Elders, <HI>Non perso|natos, &amp;c. we will not have disguised and hi|strionicall men, puffed up with titles, or idols dead in sinnes, to be meant, but holy men, who being indued with faith in God, and walking in his obedience, God authorising them, and the Church his Spouse chusing and calling them, undertake the government thereof, that they may labour to the conservation and edifica|tion of the same in Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. l. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. c. 3.</NOTE> saith <HI>Iunius.</HI> A ru|ling Elder should pray for the Spirit and gifts
<PB N="11" REF="14">
of his calling, that hee may doe the duties of his calling, and not bee like him that played the Souldan, but a Souter; hee must doe his office neither <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <HI>pro forma,</HI> hee himselfe being <HI>Parcus Deorum caltor &amp; infre|quens</HI>; nor <GAP DESC="foreign">, doing all through conten|tion and strife about particulars.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meum &amp; tuum.</NOTE> <HI>Si duo de nostras tollas pro nomina rebus, praelia</HI> (I may say <HI>Iurgia</HI>) <HI>cessarent, pax sine lite foret:</HI> Nor <GAP DESC="foreign">, Empiring and Lording among his brethren and fellow Elders;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 20.26.27.</NOTE> <HI>Whosoever will bee great among you, let him bee your mini|ster; and whosoever will bee chiefe among you, let him be your servant,</HI> saith the onely Lord and Head of the Church: Nor yet <GAP DESC="foreign">, setting himselfe only to do a pleasure, or to get preferment to such as he favoureth; Nay, nor <GAP DESC="foreign">, onely by establishing good orders, and wholesome lawes in the Church, but he must carry himselfe <GAP DESC="foreign">, service|ably and ministerially: for as his Function is <HI>Officium</HI> and <HI>Iurisdictio,</HI> so it is <HI>Munus,</HI> a burdensome service and charge laid upon him.</P>
<P>That a ruling Elder may bee such a one as hee ought to bee, two sorts of duties are re|quisite, <HI>viz.</HI> duties of his Conversation, and duties of his Calling. The duties of his conversation are the same which the Apostle
<PB N="12" REF="15">
<HI>Paul</HI> requireth in the conversation of the Mi|nister of the Word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Tim. 3.2.3.4.5.6.7. &amp;c. 6.11. Tit. 1.6.7.8.</NOTE> That he bee blamelesse, having a good report, not accused of riot, or unruly, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, a lover of good men, just, holy, temperate, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre, not selfe-willed, not soone angry, but patient, not a brawler, not covetous, one that ruleth well his owne house, having his children in sub|jection, with all gravity, one that followeth after righteousnesse, godlinesse, faith, love, patience, meeknesse, &amp;c. These and such like parts of a Christian and exemplary con|versation, being required of Pastors, as they are Elders, belong unto ruling Elders also. This being plaine, let us proceed to the du|ties of their calling.</P>
<P>For the better understanding whereof, we will distinguish with the Schoole-men, a two-fold power, the power of Order, and the power of Jurisdiction; which are diffe|rent in sundry respects. 1. The power of Or|der comprehendeth such things as a Mini|ster by vertue of his ordination, may doe without a commission from any Presbyterie, or Assembly of the Church, as to preach the Word, to minister the Sacraments, to celebrate marriage, to visite the sicke, to
<PB N="13" REF="15">
catechise, to admonish, &amp;c. The power of Jurisdiction comprehendeth such things as a Minister cannot doe by himselfe, nor by vertue of his ordination; but they are done by a Session, Presbytery, or Synod; and sometimes by a Minister, or Mini|sters, having Commission, and authority from the same, such as ordination and ad|mission, suspension, deprivation and com|munication, and receiving againe into the Church, and making of Lawes and Consti|tutions Ecclesiasticall and such like; where|of we boldly maintaine, that there is no part of Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction, in the power of one man, but of many met together in the name of Christ. 2. The power of Order is the radicall and fundamentall power, and maketh a Minister susceptive, and capable of the power of Jurisdiction. 3. The power of Order goeth no further then the Court of Conscience; the power of Jurisdiction is exercised in Externall and Ecclesiasticall Courts. Fourthly, the power of Order is sometime unlawfull in the use, yet not voide in it selfe. The power of Jurisdiction when it is unlawfull in the use, it is also voide in it selfe. If a Minister doe any act of Jurisdi|ction, as to excommunicate, or absolve with|out his owne parish, wanting also the consent
<PB N="14" REF="16">
of the Ministery and Elders of the bounds where he doth the same, such acts are voide in themselves, and of no effect. But if with|out his owne charge, and without the con|sent aforesaid, hee baptise an infant, or doe any such thing belonging to the power of Order, though his act be unlawfull, yet is the thing it selfe of force, and the Sacrament remaineth a true Sacrament.</P>
<P>Now to our purpose. We averre that this twofold power of Order and of Jurisdiction belongeh to ruling Elders as well as to Pa|stors. The power of Jurisdiction is the same in both; for the power and authority of all Jurisdiction belongeth to the Assemblies, and representative meetings of the Church, whereof the ruling Elders are necessary con|stituent members and have the power of decisive voycing no lesse then Pastors. How|beit the execution of some decrees enacted by the power of Jurisdiction belongeth to Ministers alone, for Pastors alone exercise some acts of Jurisdiction, as imposition of hands, the pronouncing of the sentence of ex|communication, the receiving of a penitent, &amp;c. Are not these things done in the name and authority of some Assembly of the Church, higher or lower? Or are they any other then the executions of the decrees and
<PB N="15" REF="16">
sentences of such an Assembly wherein ru|ling Elders voyced. The power of Order alone shall, make the difference betwixt the Pastor and the ruling Elder; for by the power of Order, the Pastor doth preach the Word, minister the Sacraments, pray in publike, blesse the Congregation, celebrate marriage, which the ruling Elder cannot. Therefore it is falsly said by that railing <HI>Rabshakeh</HI> (whom before I spoke of) Ep. pag. 7. That the ruling Elders want nothing of the power of the Minister, but that they preach not, nor baptise in publike congrega|tions: yet other things which the Pastor doth by his power of Order, the ruling El|der ought also to doe by his owne power of Order. And if we would know how much of this power of Order is common to both, let us note that Pastors doe some things by their power of Order, which all Christians ought to doe by the law of Charity. Things of this sort a ruling Elder may and ought to doe by his power of Order, and by vertue of his election and ordination to such an of|fice. For example, every Christian is bound in Charity to admonish and reprove his brother that offendeth; first, privately, then before witnesses; and if he heare not, to tell it to the Church, Levit. 19.17. Matth. 18.15.16.17.
<PB N="16" REF="17">
This a ruling Elder ought to doe by vertue of his calling, and with authority, 1 Thess. 5.12. Private Christians ought in Charity to instruct the ignorant, Joh. 4.29. Act. 18.26. to exhort the negligent, Heb. 3.15. &amp; 10.24 25. to comfort the afflicted, 1 Thess. 5.11. to support the weake, 1 Thess. 5.14. To re|store him that falleth, Galat. 6.1. to visite the sicke, Matth. 25.36.40. to reconcile those who are at variance, Matth. 5.9. to contend for the truth, and to answer for it, <HI>Iude</HI> v. 3. 1 Pet. 3.15. All which are incumbent to the ruling Elder by the authority of his calling. To conclude then, the calling of ruling El|ders consisteth in these two things. 1. To as|sist and voyce in all Assemblies of the Church, which is their power of jurisdiction. 2. To watch diligently over the whole flock all these wayes which have been mentioned, and to doe by authority that which other Christians ought to doe in charity, which is their power of order. And the Elder which neglecteth any one of these two whereunto his calling leadeth him, shall make answer to God for it. For the Word of God, the Di|scipline of this Kirke, the bonds of his owne calling and covenant, doe all binde sinne up|on his soule, if either hee give not diligence in private, by admonishing all men of their
<PB N="17" REF="17">
duty as the case requireth; or if he neglect to keepe either the Ecclesiasticall Court and Consistory within the Congregation where his charge is, or the Classicall Presbyterie, and other Assemblies of the Church, which he is no lesse bound to keepe then his Pastor, when he is called and dessigned thereunto.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The first Argument for ruling Elders, taken from the Iewish Church.</HEAD>
<P>HAving shewed what ruling Elders are, it followeth to shew Scripture and Di|vine right for them. Our first Argument is taken from the governement and pollicy of the Jewish Church thus: Whatsoever kinde of office-bearers the Jewish Church had; not as it was Jewish, but as it was a Church, such ought the Christian Church to have also. But the Jewish Church, not as it was Jewish, but as it was a Church, had Elders of the people, who assisted in their Ecclesia|sticall government, and were members of their Ecclesiasticall Consistories. Therefore
<PB N="18" REF="18">
such ought the Christian Church to have also. The Proposition will no man call in question; for, <HI>quod competit alicui qua tali competit omni tali.</HI> That which agreeth to any Church as it is a Church, agreeth to every Church. I speake of the Church as it is a politicall body, and setled Ecclesiasticall Republike. Let us see then to the Assumpti|on. The Jewish Church, not as it was a Church, but as it was Jewish, had an high Priest, typisying our great high Priest Jesus Christ. As it was Jewish, it had Musitians to play upon Harpes, Psalteries, Cymbals, and other Musicall Instruments in the Temple, 1 Chron. 25.1. concerning which, hear <HI>Bellarmines</HI> confession, <HI>de bon. oper. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 17. <HI>Iustinus saith, that the use of instru|ments was granted to the Iewes for their im|perfection: and that therefore such instruments have no place in the Church. Wee confesse in|deed that the use of musicall instruments agre|eth not alike with the perfect, and with the im|perfect, and that therefore they beganne but of late to be admitted in the Church.</HI> But as it was a Church, and not as Jewish, it had foure sorts of ordinary office-bearers, Priests, Le|vites, Doctors, and Elders, and we confor|mablie have Pastors, Deacons, Doctors, and Elders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 1.

doth rightly liken our Pastors and Deacons, for howsoever sundry things were done by the Priests and Levites, which were typicall and Jewish onely; yet may we well parallell our Pastors with their Priests, in respect of a perpetuall Ecclesiasticall office common to both, <HI>viz.</HI> the Teaching and governing of the people of God, Mal. 2.7. 2 Chron. 19.8. and our Deacons with their Levits, in respect of the cure of Ecclesiasticall goods, and of the work of the service of the house of God in the materialls and appurtenances thereof, a function likewise common to both, 1 Chro. 26.20. &amp; 23.24.28.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iun.

And all these sorts of office-bearers among us wee doe as rightly warrant from the like sorts among them as other whiles wee war|rant our baptizing of Infants from their cir|cumcising of them, our Churches by their Synagogues, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now that the Jewish Church had also
<PB N="20" REF="19">
such Elders as wee plead for, it is manifest: for besides the Elders of the Priests, there were also Elders of the people joyned with them in the hearing and handling of Ecclesi|asticall matters, Jer. 19.1. <HI>Take of the ancients of the people&punc; and of the ancients of the Priests.</HI> The Lord sending a message by the Pro|phet, would have a representative body of all Judah to be gathered together for receiving it, as <HI>Tremellius</HI> noteth. So 2 Kings 6.32. <HI>Elisha sate in his house, and the Elders sate with him.</HI> We read, 2 Chron. 19.8. That with the Priests were joyned some of the chiefe of the Fathers of Israel, to judge Ecclesia|sticall causes and controversies. And how|soever many things among the Jewes in the latter times, after the captivity, did weare to confusion and misorder, yet we finde even in the dayes of Christ, and the Apostles, that the Elders of the people still sate and voyced in Councell with the Priests, according to the ancient forme, as is cleare from sundry places of the new Testament, Matth. 16.21. and 21.23. and 26.57.59. and 27.1.12.

Hee saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.118.</NOTE> that the Elders of the Jewes were their Magistrates, which in things pertaining to the externall government of the Church, ought not to have been debarred from the Councell of the Priests, more then the Chri|stian Magistrate ought now to bee debarred from the Synods of the Church. Now to prove that their Elders were their civill Ma|gistrates, hee hath no better argument then this, That the Hebrew word <HI>Zaken,</HI> which is turned Elder, importeth a chiefe man, or a Ruler. We answer, First, this is a bold con|jecture which hee hath neither warran|ted by divine nor by humane testimo|nies.
<PB N="22" REF="20">
Secondly, <HI>Zaken</HI> doth not ever signifie a Ruler, or a man in authority, as we have shewed before. Thirdly, let us grant <HI>Zaken</HI> to bee a name of dignity, and to import a chiefe man; yet a chiefe man is not ever a Magistrate, nor a Ruler. It would onely fol|low that they were of the chiefe of the fa|thers of Israel that were joyned with the Priests in the Sanedrim, and so it was, 2 Chron. 19.8. <HI>Non hercle de plebe hominum lecti sed nobilissimi omnes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De repub.

And so are the Princes &amp; Rulers distinguished from the Elders, Act. 4.5. Judg. 8.14. Deut. 5.23. Jos. 8.33. Fifthly, we would know whether he thought that all the Magistrates of the Jews sate in Councel with the Priests, or some of them onely: if some only, we desire either proofe or proba|bility who they were, and how many; if all, then should wee by the like reason admit not the supreame Magistrate alone (which hee seemeth to say) into the Synods of the Church, but all Magistrates whatsoever, and
<PB N="23" REF="20">
what a confusion should that bee? Sixthly those Elders that sate in the civil Sanedrim, were Rulers by their sitting there; but the Elders which sate in the Ecclesiasticall Sane|drim, either were not civill Magistrates, or at least sate not there as Magistrates. So do our Magistrates sometimes sit with us, as mem|bers of our Assemblies, not as Magistrates, but as Elders. Of the distinction of those two Courts, which every one observeth not, we shall speake more afterward.</P>
<P>We have said enough against <HI>Saravia,</HI> but <HI>Bilson</HI> doth better deserve an answer, who alledgeth more specious reasons to prove, that the Elders of the Jewes were their civill Magistrates. Hee saith, There was no Se|nate nor Seniors among the Jewes, but such as had power of life and death, of imprison|ment, confiscation, banishment, &amp;c. which hee maketh to appeare thus: In the dayes of <HI>Ezra</HI> the punishment of contemners was for|feiture of their substance, and separation from the congregation, <HI>Ezra</HI> 10.8. The triall of secret murther was committed to the Elders of every City, Deut. 21.3.4. They delivered the wilfull murtherer unto the Avenger of bloud, to be put to death, Deut. 19.12. They condemned a stubborne sonne to death, Deut. 21.19. They chastened a
<PB N="24" REF="21">
man who had spoken falsly of his wife, that hee found her not a virgin, Deut. 22.15.16.18. <HI>Ans.</HI> First, if it should bee granted, that the Elders spoken of in these places, were ci|vill Magistrates, this proveth not that there were no Ecclesiasticall Elders among the Jewes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bertram de Pol.

So there might be the same two sorts of Elders among the Jewes. And what then? It is enough for us that wee finde in the Jewish Church, some Elders joyned with the Priests, &amp; employed in things Ecclesiasticall. The Elders and Priests are joyned together both in the new Testament, as Matth. 26.59. <HI>the chiefe Priests and Elders</HI>; so in other places before cited: And likewise in the old Testament, Exod. 24.1. <HI>Come up unto the Lord, thou and Aaron, Nadab and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bihu, and seventy of the El|ders of Israel,</HI> Deut. 27.1. <HI>Moses with the Elders,</HI> compared with vers. 9. <HI>Moses and the

Priests.</HI> Ezech. 7.26. <HI>The Law shall perish from the Priest, and counsell from the ancients,</HI> Jer. 19 1. <HI>Take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the Priests.</HI> Wee finde also the Commandements of God first delivered to the Elders, and by them to the people, Exod. 12.21.28. and 19.7.8. It is said, Deut. 27.1. <HI>Moses with the Elders of Israel comman|ded the people.</HI> Upon which place <HI>Hugo Car|dinalis</HI> saith: <HI>Argumentum, &amp;c.</HI> Here is an argument that a Prelat ought not to com|mand any thing without the counsell of the Elders.</P>
<P>Secondly, but it cannot bee proved, that these Elders in the places objected, were Judges or Magistrates: nay, the contrary ap|peareth from other places, which wee have before alledged for the distinction of Elders from Magistrates or Judges: whereunto wee may adde, 2 Kings 10.1. <HI>Vnto the Rulers of Iezreel, to the Elders, and to them that brought up Ahabs children.</HI> And verse 5. <HI>Hee that was over the house, and hee that was over the Citie, the Elders also, and the bringers up of the chil|dren,</HI> Ezra 10.14. <HI>The Elders of every Citie, and the Iudges thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, we read of threescore and seven|teen Elders in Succoth, Judg. 8.14. whereas the greatest number of Judges in one Citie
<PB N="26" REF="22">
among the Jewes was three for smaller mat|ters, and three and twenty for greater mat|ters. This objection <HI>Bilson</HI> himselfe moveth, but answereth it not.</P>
<P>Fiftly, as for the places which hee obje|cteth against us, the first two of them make against himselfe. In Ezra 10.8. wee finde not onely the civill punishment of forfeiture, but also as <HI>Pellicanus</HI> on that place, and <HI>Zepperus de pol. Eccl. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 7. doe observe the Ecclesiasticall punishment of excommuni|cation, or separation from the Congregati|on: the former answering to the councell of the Princes, the latter to the councell of the Elders. The place Deuter. 21.3.4. maketh against him in three respects. First, the Elders of the City did but wash their hands over the beheaded Heifer, and purge themselves before the Lord from the bloodshed, which was a matter rather Ecclesiasticall then ci|vill, <HI>neque enim, &amp;c. For there was no neede of a Iudge here who should be present formally as Iudge,</HI> saith <HI>Bonfrerius,</HI> the Jesuite, upon that place. Secondly, the controversie was decided by the word of the Priests, vers. 5. Thirdly, <HI>Tostatus</HI> thinketh that the Elders &amp; the Judges are plainely distinguished, vers. 2. <HI>Thy Elders and thy Iudges shall come forth. Quaeras hic, &amp;c. Thou mayest here aske,</HI> saith
<PB N="27" REF="22">
<HI>Pelargus, why the Elders of the people and the Iudges were both together called out? I answer, because God will have both the Magistrate and the subjects to be innocent, &amp;c.</HI> As for the o|ther places, that which seemeth to prove most for the civill power of the Jewish El|ders, is Deuter. 22. yet heare what that fa|mous Commentator, <HI>Tostatus Abulensis,</HI> saith on that place, <HI>Quando talis, &amp;c. When such a cause was to bee judged, because it was very weighty, the Elders of the City did meet toge|ther with the Iudges thereof, for in such facts there is some place for conjecture, and the El|ders who are the wiser sort, can herein bee more attentive then others.</HI> So hee noteth upon Ruth 4.2. that the Elders sate in the gate about the controversie betwixt <HI>Boaz</HI> and the other Kinsman, not as Judges, but as wit|nesses and beholders, that the matter might bee done with the more gravity and respect. Which doth further appeare from vers. 9.11. In like manner wee answer to Deut. 21.19. the Judges decided that cause with advice and counsell of the Elders: and so the name of <HI>Elders</HI> in those places may bee a name not of office, but of dignity, signifying men of chiefe note, for wisedome, gravity, and ex|perience. In which sense the word <HI>Elders</HI> is taken, Gen. 50.7. as <HI>Tostatus</HI> and <HI>Rivetus</HI> ex|pound
<PB N="28" REF="23">
that place. In the same manner we say of Deuter. 19.12. and in that case it is fur|ther to bee remembred that the Cities of re|fuge had a kinde of a sacred designation and use, for the Altar it selfe was sometimes a place of refuge, Exod. 21.14. and when the sixe Cities of refuge were appointed, they were of the Cities of the Levits Numb. 35.6. that by the judgement and counsell of the Levits who should best understand the Law of God, such controversies might be deter|mined, as <HI>Pellicanus</HI> on that place saith well; for this cause some read Josh. 20.7. <HI>They san|ctified Kedesh, &amp;c.</HI> Besides, if it bee true that these causes were judged, not in the City where the murder was committed, but in the City of refuge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Jos. 20. quaest. 3.</NOTE> as <HI>Serrarius</HI> holdeth with <HI>Masius</HI> and <HI>Montanus,</HI> and alledgeth for it some very considerable reasons, then doth <HI>Bilsons</HI> Argument from Deut. 19.12. faile also in this respect, for the Elders there men|tioned are the Elders of the City where the murder was committed.</P>

<PB N="30" REF="24">
Church or Congregation; for hee who is the God of order, not of confusion, hath committed the exercise of no Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction to a promiscuous multitude. Nor 4. can it be taken of a Prelate, who being but one, can no more be called <HI>the Church,</HI> nor one can be called many, or a member be called a body. <HI>Non enim una persona potest dici Ecclesia,</HI> saith Bell. de Eccles. l. 3. c. 17. <HI>Cum Ecclesia sit populus &amp; regnum Dei.</HI> It is plaine, that the Church there spoken of, is a certaine number met together, <HI>Where two or three are gathered together.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> guber.

It is also utterly contrary to the purpose of Christ, and to the aime of that discipline which he recommen|deth to bee used, which is the good of our brother, and the gaining of him from his of|fence, whereas the exercise of civill jurisdicti|on of the Magistrate is not intended for te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> good of the offender, and for the winning of him to repentance; but for the publike good of the Common-wealth, and for the preservation of peace, order, and justice, therein according to the lawes.

by the Church whereof our master speaketh, we must needs understand such a representa|tive meeting of the Church, wherein a scan|dalous and obstinate person may, and ought to be judged.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Praelect. tom 1. p. 23.</NOTE> And what is that? <HI>Collegium Presbyterorum,</HI> saith <HI>Camero.</HI> The Presby|tery whereof mention is made, 1 Tim. 4.14.

But how is the Presbytery called the Church, and why? First, even as the body is said to see when as the eyes alone doe see;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ubi supra, pag. 26.</NOTE> so saith <HI>Ca|mero.</HI> The Church is said to heare that which they alone doe heare, who are as the eies of
<PB N="32" REF="25">
the Church. Secondly, it is a common forme of speech to give the name of that which is represented to that which representeth it. So wee commonly say that this or that is done by the States of Holland, which is done by the Senate at Hague. Now though Bishops or Pastors alone cannot represent the Church, because hearers also belong to the definition of the Church; yet the Pres|bytery can well represent the Church, be|cause it containeth, beside those who labour in the word, ruling Elders put in authority by the Church for the government thereof, as <HI>Gerard</HI> rightly resolveth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Loc. Theol. tom. 6. p. 137.</NOTE>. Our Divines prove against Papists that some of these whom they call Laickes ought to have place in the Assemblies of the Church by this Ar|gument among the rest; because otherwise the whole Church could not be thereby re|presented. Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 8 9.10.</NOTE> the Lord commanded that the children of Israel should lay their hands upon the Levits at their consecration, and that the whole congregation should bee brought together for that effect. This, as some have observed out of <HI>Aben-Ezra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Ec+cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. discip. pag. 87.</NOTE> can|not bee so understood as if the many thou|sands which were then in the Hoste of Israel had all laid their hands upon them, but the Elders of Israel onely representing them.
<PB N="33" REF="25">
So the Lord saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 12.3. verse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.</NOTE> <HI>speake to all the Congregattion of Israel, &amp;c.</HI> But the execution of this command is expressed thus, <HI>Then Moses cal|led for all the Elders of Israel, and said unto them &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4.5.</NOTE> So Josh. 20.6. Fourthly, Pastors and Elders, as they are the Ministers of Jesus Christ, so are they the Ministers and servants of his Spouse the Church. From that which hath beene said we may draw our Argument in this forme.</P>
<P>Whatsoever Courts doe represent the Church, these are made up of ruling aswell as teaching Elders.</P>
<P>But Presbyteries and all Assemblies of the Church are Courts which represent the Church. <HI>Ergo.</HI> The proposition is proved thus: Whatsoever Courts represent hearers aswell as teachers, and the people aswell as the Ministery, these are made up of ruling as well as teaching Elders.</P>
<P>But whatsoever Courts doe represent the Church, these represent hearers aswell as teachers, &amp;c. It is plaine enough that the Church cannot bee represented except the hearers of the word, which are the farre greatest part of the Church be represented. By the Ministers of the word they cannot be represented more then the Burghes can bee represented in Parliament by the Noblemen
<PB N="34" REF="26">
or by the Commissioners of Shires&punc; there|fore by some of their owne kinde must they be represented, that is by such as are hearers and not preachers. Now some hearers cannot represent all the rest, except they have a cal|ling and commission thereto, and who can those be but ruling Elders?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Our third Argument taken from Ro|mans 12.8.</HEAD>
<P>OUR third Argument is grounded upon Rom. 12.8. The Apostle hath declared before that, as there are many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office, for the office of the eye is to see, of the eare to heare, &amp;c. So are their gifts given to the severall office-bearers of the Church, wherewith every one in his owne office may glorifie God and edifie the Church, vers. 4. with vers. 5.6. These gifts he saith are differing, according to the grace given to us; that is, according to the holy charge and office given unto us by the grace and favour of God: so vers. 3. <HI>Through the
<PB N="35" REF="26">
grace given unto me,</HI> saith <HI>Paul</HI>: that is through the authority of my Apostleship, which by grace I have obtained. Now whiles he ex|horteth every one to the faithfull and hum|ble use of his gift which he hath received for the discharge of his office, he illustrateth his exhortation by the enumeration of the or|dinary Ecclesiasticall offices vers. 6.7.8. And as <HI>Beza,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In illum lo|cum. Eccles. l. 2. c. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Piscator,</HI> and <HI>Iunius</HI> doe well resolve the text. First, he maketh a generall division of functions in the Church, making two sorts of the same <HI>Prophesie,</HI> whereby is meant the faculty of expounding Scrip|ture: and <HI>Ministerie</HI> comprehending all o|ther imployments in the Church. Prophe|cying the Apostle sudivideth into Teaching, which is the Doctors part, and Exhortation which is the Pastors. Ministery he subdivi|deth in Giving, which is the Deacons part. Ruling which is the ruling Elders part, and Shewing mercy, which pertained to them who had care of the sicke. Against this com|mentary which we have made upon the A|postles words.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Presbyt. p. 87.</NOTE> <HI>Sutcliffe</HI> objecteth a double injury which we doe to Pastors. First, if these our Elders be the Rulers here spoken of, then Pastors ought not to rule: as if (forsooth) Elders could not rule except they rule alone. Next hee saith wee make these Elders as
<PB N="36" REF="27">
necessary to the Church as Pastors; so that a Church cannot be where there are not ruling Elders, even as there is not a Church where there are not Word and Sacraments. Surely, a Church may happen to want Pastors, and so to want both the preaching of the Word, and the use of the Sacraments for that time: And so may it want Elders, and still remaine a Church, but defective and maimed. How|beit the Pastors are more necessary then the Elders, because they doe not onely rule, but preach beside.</P>
<P>But to passe this, there are other things which better deserve an answer: for one might object, 1. That the Apostle seemeth to speake of severall gifts onely, not of seve|rall offices. 2. If hee speake of Offices, by what reason make we <HI>Prophesie</HI> and <HI>Ministery</HI> generall kindes, and all the rest particular of|fices. 3. Why would the Apostle put the <HI>Deacon</HI> before the <HI>Elder.</HI> 4. Bishop <HI>An|drewes</HI> in his Sermon of the worshipping of Imaginations, maketh a fourth objection, that by our interpretation of this place, wee make <HI>Qui miseretur</HI> to be Latine for a <HI>widow.</HI></P>
<P>To the first of these we answer, The Apo|stles <HI>Protasis</HI> speaketh of severall offices, not in the same, but in severall members: how then should we make his <HI>Apodosis</HI> to speak of
<PB N="37" REF="27">
severall gifts in the same, and not in severall office-bearers of the Church: wherefore, as seeing, hearing, tasting, &amp;c. doe differ sub|jectively in respect of the members, which doe see, heare, &amp;c. So speaketh the Apostle of teaching, exhorting, ruling, &amp;c. as they are in different office-bearers. It is least of all credible which <HI>Bilson</HI> saith <HI>de Eccles. gubern. c.</HI> 10. <HI>p.</HI> 186.187. that the Apostle speaks not of the gifts of office-bearers, but of gifts di|stributed unto all the members of Christs mysticall body, even unto women. Hee had shewed us a great secret, if hee could have made it appeare, that all who are in the Church, women and all, may both prophesie and rule. In this hee shall have the praise of out-stripping the Separatists. We know that private Christians may teach and exhort one another; but they doe not so devote them|selves thereto, as altogether to wait upon tea|ching and exhorting, which is the case the A|postle speaketh of.</P>
<P>To the second wee say, that <HI>Prophesie</HI> and <HI>Ministery</HI> are put <HI>in abstracto,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oyned with a plurall <GAP DESC="foreign">; but <HI>teaching, exhorting, gi|ving, ruling,</HI> and <HI>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wing mercie,</HI> are put <HI>in c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncreto,</HI> and to each of them the single article pre fixed; which is a sufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> warrant to expound <HI>Prophesie</HI> and <HI>Ministery,</HI> as <HI>Genera,</HI>

<P>To the third we answer, He which is first named, hath not alwayes some prerogative or dignity above him which is last named&punc; else doe the Papists rightly argue, that <HI>Peter</HI> was the chiefe of all the Apostles, because they finde him named before all the rest, Matth. 10.2. Act. 1.13. The Apostle inten|ded to reckon out all ordinary offices in the Church; but he intended not the precise or|der. <HI>Chrysostome</HI> upon this same place saith: <HI>Vide quomodo ista indifferenter ponat quod minutum est primo: quod magnum est posteriore loco.</HI> Ephes. 4.11. hee putteth <HI>Pastors</HI> before <HI>Teachers</HI>: here to the Romans he putteth <HI>Tea|chers</HI> before <HI>Pastors.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Argument</HI> 4. <HI>from</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28.</HEAD>
<P>OUR fourth Argument is drawn from 1 Cor. 12.28. where we finde againe an enumeration of sundry offices in the Church (though not so perfect as that Rom. 12.) and amongst others, <HI>Helps,</HI> that is, <HI>Deacons,</HI> and <HI>Governments,</HI> that is, <HI>Ruling El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers.</HI> Where wee cannot enough admire how the Authors of the new English trans|lation were bold to turne it thus, <HI>Helps in Governments,</HI> so to make one of two, and to elude our Argument. The originall hath them cleerely distinguished, <GAP DESC="foreign">. And I finde some late editions of the Eng|lish translation to have it as it is in the Greek, <HI>Helps, Governments.</HI> How this change hath been made in the English Bibles, I know not. <HI>Chrysostome</HI> expounding, this place doth not take Helps and Governements to be all one, as <HI>Bilson</HI> hath boldly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De gub. Eccl. cap. 10. p. 204</NOTE> but falsly averred. Nay <HI>Chrysostome</HI> maketh the meaning of <GAP DESC="foreign">, to be <HI>ut pauperes suscipiamus</HI>: and the meaning of <GAP DESC="foreign">, he expounded to be <HI>praeesse ac curam gerere &amp; res administrare spirituales.</HI> The former belongs to <HI>Deacons,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="29">
the later to <HI>ruling Elders.</HI> Two answers are made to this place.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Church lib 5. cap. 26.</NOTE> D. <HI>Field</HI> answereth, that both here and Rom. 12.8. we reason <HI>&agrave; genere ad speciem affirmativ&egrave;</HI>; because the Apostle mentioneth Governours whom he requireth to rule with diligence, therefore they were such Elders as we plead for.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer to the Admon. p. 114.115</NOTE> <HI>Whitgift</HI> saith, the word <HI>Go|vernours,</HI> 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. and <HI>Rulers,</HI> Rom. 12.8. is generall, and may either signifie Christi|an Magistrates, or Ecclesiasticall, as Archbi|shops, Bishops, or whatsoever other by lawfull authority are appointed in the Church.</P>
<P>We reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temporis il|lius conditio|no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de qu bus|libet praefe|ctis Paulum loqui oftendit quia tuncnulli erant pii Ma|gistratus: sed de Senioribus qui morum e|rant Censores saith Calvine upon Rom. 12.8.</NOTE> first, if the Apostle had mentio|ned Rulers or Governours alone, then might we have indeed guessed, that hee meant a ge|nerall kinde onely, and no particular <HI>Species:</HI> But since he hath enumerate so many <HI>Species,</HI> as Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, gifts of mi|racles, gifts of tongues, &amp;c. Surely they did ei|ther most ignorantly, or most maliciously erre who tell us, that the Apostle putteth a <HI>Genus</HI> in the midst of so many <HI>Species.</HI> Secondly, the Apostle speaketh onely of Ecclesiasticall Officers, <HI>God hath set some in the Church, &amp;c.</HI> What meant <HI>Whitgift</HI> to extend his words to the civill Magistrate. T. C. answered him, that hee could not distinguish betwixt the Church and Common-wealh, and so betwixt
<PB N="42" REF="30">
the Church Officers, and the Officers of the Common-wealth. He replied, that he could not put any such difference betwixt them, that the one may not be comprehended under the Apostles word, as well as the other. <HI>For I utterly renounce,</HI> saith he, <HI>that distinction inven|ted by Papists, and maintained by you, which is, that Christian Magistrates governe not in the respect they be Christians but in the respect they be men; and that they governe Christians, not in that they bee Christians, but in that they bee men: which is to give no more authority to the Christian Magistrate in the Church of Christ, then to the great Turke.</HI> Let our opposites here goe by the eares among themselves: for M. <HI>Io. Wemys</HI> holdeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Reg. prim. p. 123.</NOTE> that all Kings have a|like jurisdiction in the Church, Infidels as wel as Christian Kings. We hold that Christian Magistrates governe their subjects, neither as Christians, nor as men, but as Magistrates; and they governe Christian subjects as Chri|stian Magistrates. In like manner, Christians are governed by Magistrates, neither as they are Christians, nor as they are men, but as they are subjects, and they are governed by Chri|stian Magistrates, as they are Christian sub|jects. And we all maintaine, that a Christian Magistrate hath great authority over Christi|an subjects, in things pertaining to the conser|vation
<PB N="43" REF="30">
and purgation of religion, which the great Turke, nor no Infidell Magistrate hath, or can have, except hee become Christian. But what doe I digressing after the imperti|nencies of a roving disputer? for what of all this? Let Christian Magistrates governe as you will, will any man say that his office is Ecclesiasticall, or to be reckoned among A|postles, Prophets Teachers? &amp;c. Wherefore</P>
<P>Let us proceed to the other answer, which is made by <HI>Saravia</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">De diver. grad, minist. Evang. c. 11. p. 115.</NOTE> Hee saith, that though the Apostle, 1 Cor. 12.28. reckon out diffe|rent gifts, wee need not for that understand different persons, nor make different orders and offices in the Church, of the gifts of mi|racles, healing, tongues, and prophecies, which might bee, and were in one man. Whereupon he resolveth the Text thus: that first, <HI>Paul</HI> setteth downe three distinct or|ders, Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers; then he reckoneth forth these common gifts of the holy Ghost (and the gift of governing amongst the rest) which were common to all the three.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>De Presbyt. p. 87.</P>
<P>De perpet. Ec|cles. gubet. cap. 10. p. 190, 191.</P></NOTE> The Apostle saith not <HI>Governours,</HI> but <HI>Governments,</HI> saith <HI>Sutcliffe,</HI> to shew that he meaneth of faculties not of persons. So saith <HI>Bilson</HI> in like manner.</P>
<P>For confutation of all this, it is to be re|membred: First, that the gifts spoken of by
<PB N="44" REF="31">
the Apostle, are given of God for the com|mon good and edification of the Church, <HI>And God hath set some in the Church, &amp;c.</HI> Se|condly, these gifts the Apostle considereth not, <HI>abstract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&egrave; &agrave; subjectis</HI>; but as they are in men indued with them, as is plaine; for hee had before reckoned forth the gifts them|selves, vers. 8.9.10. and if here he did no more but reckon them over againe, this were <HI>actum agere.</HI> He is now upon the use and ex|ercise of these gifts by the office-bearers of the Church, vers. 27.29. And though the Apostle, vers. 28. speaketh concretively on|ly of these three, Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers, yet the rest must bee understood in the same manner, <HI>per metoxymiam adjuncti</HI>; as when wee speake of Magistracy and Mini|stery, for Magistrates and Ministers&punc; yea, the Apostle, vers. 29.30. so expoundeth himself where hee speaketh <HI>concretiv&egrave;</HI> of the same things whereof hee seemed before to speake <HI>abstractiv&egrave;.</HI> Hee speaketh of them as they are in different subjects, which is most evident both by his <HI>protasis</HI> wherein hee did againe presse the same <HI>simile</HI> of the severall offices, not of the same but of severall mem|bers of the body; and likewise by the words immediately subjoyned, <HI>Are all Apostles, are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</HI> He would have stood here and said no more, if he had meant to distinguish these three orders only as <HI>Sa|ravia</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="31">
expoundeth him. But now to make it plainely appeare that hee spoke of the other gifts also, as they are in different persons, hee addeth, <HI>are all workers of miracles? have all the gifts of healing? doe all speake with tongues? doe all interprete?</HI> where wee may supply, <HI>are all for helps? are all for governe|ments?</HI> But can it bee for nought that the Apostle ommitteth these two, when he doth over againe enumerate all the rest? vers. 29.30. It is as if he had said, there are some who have none of those speciall, and (for the most part) extraordinary gifts. All are not Apostles, all are not Prophets, &amp;c. for some have but common and ordinary gifts, to bee Deacons or Elders for government.</P>
<P>There is a great controversie betwixt the <HI>Iesuits</HI> and the <HI>Doctors of Sarbon,</HI> about the meaning of this place which we have now expounded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. 5. Sect. 50.</NOTE> The Jesuits in their <HI>Spongia,</HI> writen against the censure of the University of Paris, contend, that by <HI>Helps</HI> the Apo|stle meaneth, <HI>the regular Chanoins,</HI> who help the Bishops and the Priests in preaching, ministering the Sacraments, and hearing confessions. By <HI>governments</HI> they say hee meaneth <HI>secular Priests,</HI> whom they call <HI>pa|rochi.</HI> And because hee putteth <HI>helps</HI> before <HI>governments,</HI> they inferre that <HI>Regular Cha|noins</HI> are of an higher degree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in the Hie|rarchy
<PB N="46" REF="32">
of the Church, then <HI>Secular Priests.</HI> This they maintaine (good men) for the cre|dit of their owne Polypragmaticke order, and not for the credit of other regular Cha|noins, you may be sure. The Doctors of <HI>Sorbon</HI> in their <HI>Vindicia Censura,</HI> written by <HI>Aurelius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 378.380.</NOTE> considered that they could not maintaine the meaning of the Apostle to bee onely of different gifts (which no doubt they had answered, if they had thought it to carry any probability) therefore they acknowledge that under these gifts are contained also the degrees of the Hierarchy. And that the A|postles words doe partly belong to the com|mon gifts of the Spirit, as powers and inter|pretation of tongues, partly to the Hierarchy: of this later sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 362. &amp;c.</NOTE> they make <HI>helps and govern|ments.</HI> And by <HI>the helps</HI> they seeme to un|derstand Archdeacons and Curates.</P>
<P>But now to conclude this Argument also, thus it is: They who have the gift and office of governing the Church, and are different from them, who have other gifts and offices in the Church, can be no other then the ru|ling Elders, which we plead for.</P>
<P>But these <GAP DESC="foreign"> spoken of, 1 Cor. 12.28. are such. <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>

<PB N="47" REF="32">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Argument</HI> 5. <HI>from</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17.</HEAD>
<P>OUR fift Argument is taken from a cleer place, 1 Tim. 5.17. <HI>Let the Elders that rule well bee counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and do|ctrine.</HI> Hence we reason after this manner.</P>
<P>These Churches which had some Elders that laboured not in the Word and Doctrine, yet were worthy of double honour for ru|ling well, had the very same ruling Elders we plead for.</P>
<P>But the Apostolicke Churches had some Elders that laboured not in the Word and Doctrine, yet were worthy of double honor for ruling well. <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P>The Argument riseth from the plaine Text, then which what can be cleerer? But there are some who would darken light, and ligh|ten darkenesse.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Field</HI> propoundeth three glosses upon this place for the frustration of our Ar|gument.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Church. <HI>l.</HI> 5. c. 26.</NOTE> First, that the guides of the Church are worthy of double honour, both in respect of governing and teaching, but especially for their paines in teaching; so that the A|postle
<PB N="48" REF="33">
noteth two parts or duties of Presby|teriall offices, not two sorts of Presbyters. This is manifestly against the Text, which speaketh of officers, not of offices, of per|sons, not of duties, for it is not said, <HI>especially for labouring, &amp;c.</HI> But <HI>especially they that la|bour, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, he saith, among Elders some la|boured principally in governing and mini|stering the Sacraments, some in preaching. So <HI>Paul</HI> sheweth that he preached and labou|red more then all the Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 15.10. &amp; 1.14. Act. 14.12.</NOTE> but baptised few or none. And when <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were companions, and their travells equall; yet <HI>Paul</HI> was the chiefe speaker; so that though both were worthy of double honour, yet <HI>Paul</HI> especially. But for answer to this. First, we would gladly know what warrant had hee for expounding <HI>Pauls</HI> more aboun|dant labouring then all the Apostles, of his preaching alone? Secondly, what warrant for such a distinction of Elders, that some laboured principally in governing, some in preaching? Because <HI>Paul</HI> preached and did not baptise, and because hee was the chiefe speaker when hee and <HI>Barnabas</HI> travelled to|gether: therefore some Elders laboured in governing, some in preaching; good Logick forsooth. Thirdly, thought he that the A|postle
<PB N="49" REF="33">
did ever account such Ministers as doe not mainly labour in preaching to be worthy of double honour: nay, it was never the Apo|stles minde to allow any honour, farre lesse double honour, either to non-preaching or to seldome preaching Ministers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 15. in 1 Tim.</NOTE> <HI>Vt quid enim doctor appellatur nisi ut doc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at?</HI> saith <HI>Chryso|stome.</HI> 4. Tell me whether is preaching a duty belonging to all the Ministers of the Gospell or not? if it be not the duty of all, then it is the duty of none, but a work of supererogation or some such thing; for if some be not bound to preach by their Presbyteriall order and vo|cation, what is there that should binde others to preach? The order and calling of a Pres|byter is alike common to all. Now if all bee bound to preach (which <HI>Field</HI> himselfe see|meth to say in his first glosse, when hee cal|leth paines in teaching, a part or duty of the Presbyteriall office, no lesse then governing) how shall those Presbyters bee worthy of double honour, who doe not the duties of their Presbyteriall office, but leave the one halfe of them undone?</P>
<P>Thirdly, saith <HI>Field,</HI> there were some that remained in certaine places for governing of those who were already wonne by the prea|ching of the Gospell: others travelled with great labour, from place to place, to preach
<PB N="50" REF="34">
Christ to such as had never heard of him. Both these were worthy of double honour, but especially the later, who did not build up|on anothers foundation, nor governe those whom others had gained. The Poet would here answere:
<Q><L>Non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri.</L></Q></P>
<P>A Physitian would haply say, that to pre|vent the recidivation, is as much worth as the cure. But I answer, 1. There is no such opposition in the Text, but a subordination rather: for Elders who labour in the word and doctrine, are not contra-distinguished from Elders that rule well, but are declared to bee one kinde of Elders that rule well. 2. Though the Apostles and Evangelists tra|velled from one Countrey to another, to preach Christ to such as never heard of him; yet where hath hee read that some of these who were meere&punc; Presbyters (for of such speaketh the Text in hand) did so likewise? It rather appeareth from Act. 14.23. Tit. 1.5. that Elders were ordained in every Citie, there to remain at their particular charges, and no Elders finde we ordained by the Apostles <HI>ordinatione vaga.</HI></P>
<P>We have heard D. <HI>Fields</HI> three glosses up|on this place in question. <HI>Sutcliffe</HI> hath given us other three which are no better.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Presbyt. cap. 12.</NOTE> First, he
<PB N="51" REF="34">
saith, that if there bee here any distinction of ruling Elders, it is betwixt those that labour more aboundantly and painfully, and betwixt those that labour not so much.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>De diver. grad. minis. Evang. c. 13.</P>
<P>Paren. cap. 11. pag. 38.</P>
<P>Episcop. by div. right. pag. 219.</P></NOTE> This glosse is also received by <HI>Saravia,</HI> by <HI>Titen,</HI> by Bishop <HI>Hall</HI> in his Assertion of Episcopacie by divine right. They tell us, it is one thing to preach, another thing to labour in the word and do|ctrine, <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. It is not the ministery of the word, but the ministery of ruling which here the Apostle maketh common to both. 2. This exposition alloweth not onely honour, but double honour; yea, a high degree of double honour to such as take no paines in preaching, but are sparing therein. 3. It maketh the A|postles speech not to grow, but to fall: for <GAP DESC="foreign"> when they have stretched it to the full, noteth onely great labour, whereas to rule well importeth both great labour and great prudence, dexterity, faithfulnesse and charity beside. 4. It maketh the last part of the speech, <HI>In the Word and Doctrine,</HI> to bee superfluous: for they hold that all the difference here, is in the measure or manner of labour, and no dif|rence <HI>in re subjecta.</HI> 5. All who have any charge in the Ministery, are called <GAP DESC="foreign"> 1 Thess. 5.11. If they be at all faithfull, and worthy of honor, then do they labour, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.8. yea, in labouring, watch, as they that must give account, Heb. 13.27. 6. The Rhe|mists
<PB N="52" REF="35">
doe interpret the Apostle in the same manner. But <HI>Cartwright</HI> answereth them; If hee had meant any extraordinary labour, hee would rather have sayd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11.27. 1 Thess&punc; 2.9.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, then <GAP DESC="foreign">: for other where hee useth <GAP DESC="foreign">, as a degree of painful travell above <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is put for common labour, Rom, 16.12.</P>
<P>But it may be the next Commentary shall be better. The words, saith <HI>Sutcliffe,</HI> are to be rendred thus: <HI>Let Elders that rule well, bee counted worthy of double honour, labouring greatly in the Word and Doctrine</HI>: so that the later part of the speech is added exegetically, to shew who they bee that rule well, to wit, these who labour greatly in the word and do|ctrine. That the words are so to bee under|stood, he undertaketh to prove from the text it selfe: For, saith hee, one who purposeth to say in Greeke, <HI>especially they who labour,</HI> will not say, <GAP DESC="foreign">, but <GAP DESC="foreign">. Thus changing the Participle into a Verb, and the prepositive article <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is written with an aspiration alone, into the subjunctive <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>cum accentu gravi,</HI> for this answereth to the relative <HI>who,</HI> which the prepositive article doth never. Moreover, saith he, if the Apo|stle would have distinguished <HI>Elders</HI> into these that preach, and these that preach not, he would have added the adversative particle <GAP DESC="foreign"> after <GAP DESC="foreign">: for <GAP DESC="foreign"> signifieth indeed
<PB N="53" REF="35">
<HI>especially,</HI> but <GAP DESC="foreign"> alone without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> signifi|eth <HI>greatly,</HI> or <HI>much,</HI> as here it doth. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. This reading of his is very harsh, and had need to sound better before it contradict both the English Translators, and the common current of Protestant Interpreters. 2. Hee is not so very well skilled in the Greeke, as hee boasteth to bee, unlesse he make the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> a great <HI>Ignoramus</HI> in that language. For hee putteth a Participle with the Pre|positive Article for a Verbe and a Rela|tive, Philip. 4.7. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>and the peace of God which passeth all understanding.</HI> So Eph. 4.22. <GAP DESC="foreign">. The old man which is cor|rupt, and v. 24. <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>The new man which after God is created.</HI> 1 Thess. 5.12. <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>To know them which labour among you.</HI> If <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t|cliffs</HI> rule hold, we may not read it so, but thus, <HI>To know them labouring among you.</HI> So Apoc. 7.14. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>These are they who come out of great tribulation.</HI> Many places of this kinde there are, which I need not cite. 3. An Ellipsis of the particle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, is no error, no not in members of an opposi|tion, as Col. 2.23. much lesse in the distin|ction of a <HI>Species</HI> from the <HI>Genus.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="foreign"> without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, is put for <HI>especially,</HI> as well as when it hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 1 Tim. 4.10. <HI>who is the Saviour of all
<PB N="54" REF="36">
men, especially of these that beleeve.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. This skilled Grecian would have us to conceive it thus: <HI>God is the Saviour of all men who beleeve much</HI>: and so it shall be a com|fortlesse text for those of little faith.</P>
<P>Surely this man had need to be more happy in his third exposition; and now let us know what it is? He saith, that though wee could evince, that the Apostle here speaketh of some other Elders besides the Ministers of the word; yet wee shall have no advantage for our ruling Elders: for the Apostle being to prove that the Ministers of the word ought to be maintained, why might he not, saith he, use this generall proposition, That all Rulers, whether publicke or domestick, whether Ci|vill or Ecclesiasticall, are to bee honored? When the Apostle speaketh of the chusing of Deacons, he will have them to bee such as have ruled their own houses well. This is his last refuge, and how weak, let any ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> judge. We have heard of many sorts of Rulers, but who did ever hear (before <HI>Sutliffe</HI> told it) of Domesticke or Civill Elders that rule well. Had not the word Elders been in the Text, but the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> alone, he might have been the bolder to have given this sense. But since the Apostle speaketh not generally of
<PB N="55" REF="36">
them that rule well, but of Elders in the Church that rule well, this marreth his glosse altogether.</P>
<P><HI>Bilson</HI> giveth yet another sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De perpet. Eccl. gub. c. 10.</NOTE> That there were two sorts of Elders, some who laboured in the word and doctrine, some who had the care of the poore: both were worthy of dou|ble honour; but especially they who labou|red in the word. <HI>Answ.</HI> Deacons are distin|guished from Elders, Rom. 12. 1 Cor. 12. 1 Tim. 3. and by all antiquity. If wee make Deacons to bee Elders, and the care of the poore to be an act of ruling, then let us make what you will of the plainest Scriptures.</P>
<P>I finde in <HI>Didoclavius</HI> three other interpre|tations beside the former:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Altar Damasc. cap. 12.</NOTE> First, <HI>Bridges</HI> saith, That by Elders who labour not in the word and doctrine, are meant rulers or inferiour Magistrates, chosen for compounding of ci|vill controversies. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. This is a strange language to call civill Magistrates by the name of Elders. 2. The Apostle is speaking of Ecclesiasticall not of Civill office-bearers. 3. This exposition maketh Pastors who la|bour in the word and doctrine, to bee a sort of civill Magistrates, because they are a kinde of Elders that rule well.</P>
<P>Next, Bishop <HI>King</HI> expoundeth this place of old and infirme Bishops, who cannot la|bour
<PB N="56" REF="37">
in the word and doctrine. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. The Apostle speaketh of Presbyters, not of Pre|lates. 2. To rule well importeth as great la|bour as preaching, and somewhat more, as I shewed before, so that they who cannot la|bour in preaching, cannot labour in ruling neither. 3. They who have eviscerate and spent themselves in the work of the Ministry, who have been (as long as they could stand up|on their feet) valiant Champions for the truth, against the enemies thereof, who have served their time according to the will of God, with|out the staine of Heresie, Schisme, Apostasie, or unfaithfulnesse, when they become old and infirme, they ought not to be the lesse honoured (as the impious verdict of this Pre|late would have it) but so much the more honour ought to be given to their hoare head found in the way of righteousnesse.</P>
<P>Another Glosse is given by the same <HI>King,</HI> namely, that the Apostle would have Mini|sters, not onely to live well, but to feed also by the word and doctrine. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. The ri|sing of the Apostles words doth not concern duties, but persons, as wee have said before. 2. To live well is not to rule well, unlesse wee will make all who live godly, to rule well. 3. Thirdly, this glosse doth stil leave a double honor to Ministers that live well, though they do not preach.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The testimony of <HI>Ambrose</HI> for ruling El|ders vindicated.</HEAD>
<P>IF wee looke backe beyond the times of declining unto the first and purest times of the Church, wee shall finde ruling Elders to be no new fangled device at <HI>Geneva</HI>; but that the primitive government and policy of the Church hath beene in them restored. There is one place of <HI>Ambrose</HI> which clee|reth it sufficiently. He writing on 1 Tim. 5.1. <HI>Rebuke not an Elder,</HI> saith, <HI>Vnde &amp; Synagoga, &amp;c. Wherefore both the Iewish Synagogue, and after the Church had Senior or Elders, without whose counsell nothing was done in the Church: which by what negligence it grew out of use, I know not, except perhaps by the sloth, or rather by the pride of the teachers, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es they alone will seeme to be something.</HI> This sentence is also cited in <HI>Glossa ordinar.</HI> And it sheweth
<PB N="58" REF="38">
plainely that as the Jewish, so the Christian Church had some Elders, who though they were not Teachers of the Word, yet had a part of the government of the Church upon their shoulders. But that this came into desue|tude, partly through the sloth of the teachers and Ministers of the Word, whiles they were not carefull to preserve the ordinances of God, and the right way of governing the Church; and partly through their pride whilst they would doe all by themselves, and have no consorts,
<Q><L>Vtinam modo nostra redirent</L>
<L>In mores tempora priscos.</L></Q></P>
<P>But let us heare a triple divination which the non-friends of ruling Elders give forth upon this testimony.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Episcop. by div. r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght. p. 226.</NOTE> First, Bishop <HI>Hall</HI> tel|leth us that it is not <HI>Ambrose,</HI> but a counter|feit who wrote that Commentary upon the Epistles, and for this he alledgeth our owne <HI>Parker</HI> against us.

<PB N="59" REF="38">
but sheweth withall, that he nothing doub|teth of the Catholike authority of the Com|mentaries themselves; <HI>Hoc vero, &amp;c. This</HI> saith he, <HI>may befall the best Author whosoever he be, that some may ascribe his workes to ano|ther. But that hee lived before the Councell of Nice, this addeth weight to his testimony of the Seniors.</HI> These Commentaries are common|ly cited by our Divines, as <HI>Ambrose's.</HI> I finde them in <HI>Erasmus</HI> his edition, both at <HI>Collen,</HI> 1532. and at <HI>Paris,</HI> 1551. acknowledged to bee the genuine workes of <HI>Ambrose,</HI> only the Prefaces before the Epistles are called in question. They are also acknowledged in the edition of <HI>Costerius</HI> at Basile, 1555. <HI>Six|tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Senensis</HI> ascribeth them to <HI>Ambrose</HI> in like manner. The edition of <HI>Collen,</HI> 1616. hath an observation prefixed, which repudiateth many of his workes, and these Commenta|ries among the rest. Yet the last edition at Paris, 1632. hath expunged that observation, which they had not done if they had appro|ved the same: Howsoever that same obser|vation maketh those Commentaries to bee as old as 372. or 373. <HI>Perkins</HI> in his prepara|tive before his demonstration of the pro|bleme, calleth in question the Commentary upon the Hebrewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Critic. sacr. l. 3 c. 18.</NOTE> but no more. <HI>Rivet</HI> sheweth that these who reject them, doe nei|ther

I beleeve that <HI>Cooke</HI> in his <HI>Censura Scriptorum veterum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 134.</NOTE> hath touched the true cause why these Commentaries are so much called in question, which is the perfidiousnesse of Pa|pists, who when they finde any thing therein which they imagine to bee for their advan|tage, then they cry, Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> saith thus, but when they finde any thing therein which maketh against them, then they say as <HI>Hall</HI> doth, It is not <HI>Ambrose,</HI> but a counterseit; I must confesse that <HI>Hall</HI> is wiser in disclai|ming the same, then his fellowes in acknow|ledging them: yet because he found that the Testimony may bee of force, though not <HI>Ambrose's,</HI> and beside had no proofe for this alledgeance, he durst not trust to it, but thought upon another answer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De gub. Eccl. cap. 11. p. 210. De Presby<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. c. 13. Of the Church. lib. 5. cap. 26.</NOTE>To proceed then to their next conjecture. <HI>Bilson, Sutcliffe,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Field,</HI> tell us that <HI>Ambrose</HI> meant of Bishops, who exclu|ded other Clergy men from their consultati|ons, and that by the name of Teachers hee might fitly understand the Bishops, seeing
<PB N="61" REF="39">
none but they have power to preach in their owne right, &amp; others but onely by permission from them. This is a most desperate shift for a bad cause. For first, there is no warrant nei|ther from Scripture nor Antiquity to distin|guish Bishops from other Ministers of the Word by the name of Teachers. Secondly, as for that reason alledged that none but Bi|shops have power to preach in their owne right, it is contrary to that which <HI>Field</HI> him|selfe saith in the very next Chapter, where he holdeth that Presbyters are equall with Bishops in the power of order, and that they may preach and minister the Sacraments by vertue of their order, as well as Bishops. Thirdly, neither did the advising of Bishops with Presbyters cease in <HI>Ambrose</HI> his time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. 27.</NOTE> For as <HI>Field</HI> himself noteth out of the fourth Councell of <HI>Carthage</HI> (which was holden shortly after <HI>Ambrose</HI> his writing hereof) all sentences of Bishops were declared to bee void, which were not confirmed by the presence of their Clergy. Let us also heare <HI>Hierome</HI> and <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> (who lived both in the same age with <HI>Ambrose</HI>) <HI>what doth a Bi|shop,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. ad Evag.</NOTE> saith <HI>Hierome, ordination excepted, which a Presbyter may not doe?

We reply. First, falshood can|not keepe its feet. Before we heard <HI>Saravia</HI> maintaine that the Seniors among the Jewes, who sate in Ecclesiasticall Assemblies with the Priests, and had equall suffrages therein with the Priests, were their Rulers and their Magistrates, now he telleth us they were old men, Elders by age only, not by office. Se|condly, in his defence of that same twelveth Chapter against <HI>Beza,</HI> hee acknowledgeth that the Christian Church had other Elders by office, besides the Ministers of the Word. <HI>The Church</HI> saith hee, <HI>hath had Elders some by divine institution, as the Pastors of Churches, and Ministers of the Word of God.
<PB N="63" REF="40">
Others by condition of age or office&punc; or estimation, or learning and experience.</HI> How could hee then astrict the words of <HI>Ambrose</HI> to Elders by age onely? 3. Where was it ever read or heard, that old men, who had no Ecclesia|sticall office, were taken into the assemblies of the Church, so that nothing was done with|out their counsell? 4. The <HI>Elders</HI> of whom <HI>Ambrose</HI> speaketh, are opposed to the <HI>Tea|chers,</HI> therefore they are not <HI>Elders</HI> by <HI>age</HI>: for such are some of the <HI>Teachers</HI> themselves. 5. <HI>Ambrose</HI> indeed in his preceding words had expounded the place of the Apostle, 1 Tim. 5.1. of <HI>Elders</HI> by age: but thereupon he tooke occasion to speake of <HI>Elders</HI> by <HI>of|fice</HI> also. 6. That the <HI>Elders</HI> which wee read to have been in the Jewish Church, were not <HI>Elders</HI> by <HI>age&punc; Basil</HI> sheweth plainly, whose testimony we shall heare by and by.</P>

Church, is because Bishops, Presbyters, that preach and minister the Sacraments, and Deacons, howsoever they much degenera|ted in later times, yet all still remained in all Christian Churches throughout the World, both Greeke and Latine, in their names and offices also in some sort. But of these ruling Elders, there are no foot-steps to bee found in any Christian Church in the World, nor were not for many hundred yeares; whereas there would have beene some remaines of these as well as the other, had they ever had any institution from Christ or his Apostles, as the other had. To this wee answer. 1. If the Christian Churches throughout the World had wan|ted ruling Elders longer then they did, yet prescription can be no prejudice to the ordi|nance of God. 2. After that the golden age of the Apostles was spent and gone, exact diligence was not taken, to have the Church provided with well qualified Ministers, but many unfit men, yea, sundry heretickes en|tred into that sacred vocation, whereby it came to passe that corruption and errour overflowed the Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. hist. lib. 3. c. 32.35.

and government of the Church. 3. In the Roman, yea in Prelaticall Churches there are scarce any foot-steps at all of the offices of preaching Presbyters, and Deacons, as they were instituted by the Apostles. The Apostles ordained Presbyters to preach the Word, to minister the Sacraments, to go|verne the Church, and to make use of the keyes. But the Popish and Prelaticall Presbyters have not the power of the keyes, nor the power of Church government, for it is proper to their Prelates; as for the other two they are common to their Deacons, for they also doe preach and baptise. The office of the Popish Priest standeth in two things, to con|secrate and offer up the body of Christ, and to absolve the faithfull from their sinnes: See <HI>Conci. Triden. de sacr. Ordin. cap.</HI> 1. <HI>Hier. Savanarola. Triumph. cruc. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 16. And the same two make up the proper office of the Priest by the order of the English Service Booke. As touching Deacons, they were ordained by the Apostles for collecting receiving, keeping, and distributing of Ec|clesiasticall goods, for maintaining of Mini|sters, schooles, Churches, the sicke, stranger, and poore. The Popish and Prelaticall Dea|cons have no such office, but an office which the Apostles never appointed to them; for
<PB N="80" REF="49">
they had no preaching nor baptising Dea|cons. <HI>Philip</HI> preached and baptised, not as a Deacon, but as an Evangelist, Acts 21.8. Besides at the time of his preaching and bap|tising, hee could not have exercised the office of his Deaconship, by reason of the persecu|tion, which scattered rich and poore and all, Acts 8.1. that which <HI>Steven</HI> did, Acts 7. was no more then every believer was bound to doe, when he is called to give a testimo|ny to the truth, and to give a reason of his faith and practice. 4. Others of the faithfull, besides the Ministers of the Word, have beene admitted unto Councells and Synods by many Christian Churches throughout the World, as is well knowne; and this is a ma|nifest foot-step of the government of ruling Elders. 5. Nay in the Church of <HI>England</HI> it selfe, at this day, there are foot-steps of ru|ling Elders, else what meaneth the joyning of Lay-men with the Clergy in the high Commission to judge of matters Ecclesiasti|call? <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ravia</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE> the Churchwardens which are in every Parish of <HI>England,</HI> have some resemblance of ruling Elders, whose change appointed by law, he saith, is to col|lect, keepe, and deburse the goods and reve|nues of the Church, to preserve the fabricke of the Church&punc; and all things pertaining
<PB N="81" REF="49">
thereto sure and safe, to keep account of bap|tismes, mariages, and burials, to admonish de|linquents &amp; other inordinate livers, to delate to the Bishop or his substitutes, such as are in|corrigible, &amp; scandalous, being sworn thereto: also to observe who are absent fro~ the praiers in the Church upon the Lords dayes, &amp; upon the holy dayes, &amp; to exact from them the pe|nalty appointed by law, and finally to see to quietnes &amp; decency in time of divine service.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Fields</HI> second reason is for that <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Tim. 3. shewing who should be Bi|shops and Ministers, who Deacons, yea, who Widowes; passeth immediatly from descri|bing the qualitie of such as were to be Bi|shops and Ministers of the Word and Sacra|ments, to the Deacons, omitting these ruling Elders that are supposed to lye in the midst betweene them, which he neither might nor would have omitted, if there had beene any such. To this the answer is easie. 1. As we collect the actions and sufferings of Jesus Christ, and the institution of the last supper, not from any one of the Evangelists, but from all of them compared together, for that one toucheth what another omitteth; so doe we judge of the office-bearers of the Church not from 2 Tim. 3. only, but from the col|lation of that and other places of Scripture of that kind. Ruling Elders are found in o|ther places, and in the fifth Chapter of that
<PB N="82" REF="50">
same Epistle, though not in the third. 2 Neither were there any absurdity to hold, that the Apostle in that third Chapter com|prehendeth all the ordinary office-bearers in the Church under these two Bishops and Deacons, and that under the name of Bi|shops, he comprehendeth both Pastors, Do|ctors, &amp; ruling Elders: for as al these three are overseers, so to them all agree the qualities of a Bishop here mentioned, whereof there is only one, which seemeth not to agree to the ruling Elder, <HI>viz.</HI> that he should be apt to teach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De div. gra. minist. cap. 9.</NOTE> vers. 2. Yet <HI>Beza</HI> maintaineth a|gainst <HI>Saravia,</HI> that the ruling Elder teach|eth as wel as the Pastor, only the Pastor doth it publickly to the whole congregation; the ruling Elder doth it privately, as he findeth every one to have need. And we have shewed before that as a private Christian is bound in charity to teach the ignorant, so the ruling Elder is bound to doe it <HI>ex off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cio.</HI></P>
<P>The third reason, which Doctor <HI>Field</HI> bringeth against us, is, for that neither Scrip|ture nor practice of the Church, bounding the government of such governours, nor gi|ving any direction how farre they may goe in the same, and where they must stay, lest they meddle with that they have nothing to doe with, men should bee left to a most
<PB N="83" REF="50">
dangerous uncertainety in an office of so great consequence. Our answer to this is: 1. Wee have shewed already the certaine bounds of the power and vocation of ruling Elders. 2. It was not necessary that the A|postle should severally set downe Canons and directions: first, touching Pastors, then Doctors; lastly, ruling Elders, since they are all Elders, and all members of the El|dership or Presbytery; it was enough to de|liver canons and directions common to them all, especially since the duties of ruling El|ders are the same which are the duties of Pastors, only the Pastors power is cumula|tive to theirs, and over reacheth the same in the publicke ministery of the Word and Sa|craments, and so doth <HI>Paul</HI> difference them, 1 Tim. 5.17.</P>
<P>His fourth reason is, because we fetch the paterne of the government of ruling Elders, from the Sanedrim of the Jewes, the plat|forme whereof wee suppose Christ meant to bring into his Church, when he said, <HI>Tell the Church</HI>; whereas, saith he, it is most cleere that the court was a civill court, and had a power to banish, to imprison, yea and to take away life, till by the Romans the Jewes were restrained.

Hence it is that we read 2 Chron. 19.8.11. <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> set in <HI>Ierusa|lem</HI> of the Levits, and of the chiefe Priests, and of the chiefe of the Fathers of Israel, some for the Lords matters, among whom presided <HI>Amariah</HI> the chiefe Priest, and some for the Kings matters, among whom presided <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">badiah</HI> the Ruler of the house of Judah.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bi sup. ca. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. pag. 119.</NOTE> <HI>Saravia</HI> saith this place proveth not that there were two distinct consistories, one for civill, another for Ecclesiasticall things; because, saith he, by the Kings matters are

If none but the Ministers of the word should sit and voice in a Synod, then it could not bee a Church representative, because the most part of the Church (who are the hearer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and not the teachers of the word) are not represented in it. 7. A common cause ought to be concluded by common voices. But that which is treated of in Councils is a common cause pertaining to many parti|cular Churches. Our Divines when they prove against Papists that the election of Ministers and the excommunication of ob|stinate sinners ought to be done by the suf|frages of the whole Church they make use of this same argument; <HI>That which con|cerneth
<PB N="100" REF="60">
all ought to be treated of and judged by all.</HI> 8. Some of all estates in the com|mon-wealth, voice in Parliament, therefore some of all sorts in the Church ought to voice in Councils and Synods; for <HI>de pari|bus idem judicium,</HI> A Nationall Synod is that same to the Church, which. A Parlia|ment is to the Common-wealth. 9. Those Elders whose right we plead, are called by the Apostle rulers, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.8. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. and Governours, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. there|fore needs must they voice and judge in those assemblies, without which the Church cannot be ruled nor governed. Jf this be de|nyed them they have no other function be|hind, to make them Rulers or Governours of the Church. <HI>Rome</HI> was ruled by the Se|nate, not by the <HI>Censors</HI>; and <HI>Athens</HI> was governed by the <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">opagus,</HI> not by the inferiour Office-bearers, who did only take heed, how the Lawes were observed. But let us now see what is objected against this power of Ruling Elders, to voice in Coun|cill, and to Iudge of all things, even matters of faith treated therein. First it is alleadged that lay-men have not such abilities, of gifts and learning, as to judge aright of such mat|ters. But I dare say there are Ruling Elders in <HI>Scotla~d,</HI> who in a theological dispute, should powerfully spoyle many of those who make
<PB N="101" REF="60">
this objection. 2. <HI>Antonius Sadeel, Iohannes a Lasco, Morney,</HI> and such like shew plainely to the world, that gifts &amp; singular learning, are not tyed to Bishops and Doctors of the Church. 3. Neither doe men of subtile wits and deepest learning, prove alwayes fittest to dispute and determine questions of faith. It is marked in y^e historie of the Councill of <HI>Nice,</HI> that there was a <HI>Lay-man</HI> therein, of a simple and sincere mind, who put to silence a subtile Philosopher, whom all the Bi|shops could not compes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. 4. There are many both in Parliament and secret Coun|sell without all controversie able to give their suffrages, and to judge of matters in hand, who notwithstanding, are not of such learning and Eloquence as to enter into the lists of a publique dispute. 5. And if the gifts and abilities, of the most part of ruling Elders, were as small as their adversaries will be pleased to call them, yet this con|cludeth nothing against their right power of voicing, but onely against their aptitude and fitnesse unto that, whereto their right would carry them. And we doubt that e|very Pastour be well gifted, for all which co~meth within the compasse of his vocati|on, or doth well every thing, which he hath power to doe. Another objection is made from 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.32. <HI>The spirits of the Pro|phets, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> subject to the Prophets</HI>: whence they collect,

<P>TOuching the first of these, it cannot be denyed, but as Election to the Office, so ordination to the exer|cise thereof, is a thing common both to Preaching and Ruling Elders.

<PB N="105" REF="62">
as cannot be in reason condemned; Neither is a stipend, nor continuance in the Functi|on till Death, essentiall to the Ministery of the Church, but separable from the same. The <HI>Levites</HI> of old served not at all times, but by course, and when they were 50. yeares old, they were wholly liberat, from the burden and labour (though not from the attendance) of the <HI>Leviticall</HI> service, and Ministers, may still upon the Churches permission, for lawfull Reasons, and urgent Necessities, be absent a whole yeere, and lon|ger too, from their particular charges.

<HEAD>THE Second Part, concerning the Assemblies of the Church of SCOTLAND, and Authority thereof.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of popular Government in the Church.</HEAD>
<P>THere bee some that call in question the Warrant and Authority of classicall <HI>Presbyteries,</HI> of provinciall Synods and Nationall Assemblies, as they are used and maintained in the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI> I meane not the Praelaticall facti|on, whom we set aside, but even some who are as <HI>Antiepiscopall</HI> as we are. The <HI>Scru|pulosity</HI> of such (at least of many such) herein doth (we conceive) proceed not from any
<PB N="109" REF="64">
perversnesse of mind, but onely from cer|taine mistakings, which better information may remove.</P>
<P>But first of all wee require those, whom we now labour to satisfie, to condescend up|on another point, <HI>viz.</HI> that the exercise of Ecclesiasticall power and jurisdiction in a particular Congregation, ought not to bee committed to the whole collective body thereof, but is peculiar to the Eldership re|presenting the same; for in vaine doe wee debate the other point concerning Presby|teries and Assemblies, if this latent preju|dice still occupy their minds, that the Go|vernment of the Church must needs be po|pular, exercised by the collective body, which happily may in some sort bee done within the bounds of a well limited Congre|gation, but is manifestly inconsistent with classicall Presbyteries &amp; Synods, because the collective Bodies of all particular Congre|gations within the bounds of a shire, of a Province, of a Nation, cannot bee ordinarily, nor at all ordinatly, as|sembled together, and if they could,
<PB N="110" REF="65">
I beleeve that the <HI>Separatists</HI> themselves would in that case allow a dependencie or subordination of particular <HI>Congregations</HI> unto the more generall <HI>Congregation.</HI> So that the point of popular government being once cleared, it shall facilitate the other question concerning the Subordination of particular <HI>Elderships</HI> to <HI>class<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icall Pres|byteries</HI> &amp; <HI>Synods.</HI> Now there are good rea|sons why this popular government or exer|cise by jurisdiction by all can not be admit|ted into a <HI>Congregation.</HI></P>
<P>First, in every <HI>Christian Congregation,</HI> there are some Rulers, some ruled, some Go|vernors, some governed, some that com|mand, some that obey, as is manifest from <HI>Hebr.</HI> 13.17. 1. <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.12. 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. <HI>But if the whole Congregation have the Rule and Government, who then shall be ruled and governed?</HI> It will be answered, that in the ex|ercise of jurisdiction, every Member is to act according to it's owne condition, the head as the head, the eye as the eye, &amp;c. that the Rulers and Governors of a Congrega|tion are to have the principall condu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of businesse, and to bee Heads, Eares, Mouths, &amp;c. to the <HI>Congregation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="65">But this <HI>simile</HI> maketh rather for us then against us, for though every member bee usefull and steadable in the body according to it's owne condition, yet every member neither can nor doth exercise those princi|pall actions of seeing, hearing, tasting, &amp;c. I say not that other members cannot see, heare, taste, as the eyes, eares, and mouth doe, but they cannot at all see, heare, nor taste. So if the Rulers of a Congregation be as the eyes, eares, mouth, &amp;c. then other members of the Congregation cannot at all act those actions of government which they act. Hence it is that some, who make the whole Congregation the first subject of the power of spirituall Jurisdiction, doe notwithstanding hold that the whole Church doth exercise the said jurisdiction as <HI>Principium quod,</HI> the Eldership alone, as <HI>Principium quo,</HI> even as the whole man seeth, as <HI>Principium quod,</HI> the eye alone, as <HI>Principium quo,</HI> and so of all the rest. Thus doe they put a difference betwixt the pow|er it selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Suecan. de dis|cip. Eccles. part</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI> 2&punc;</NOTE> and the exercise of it, ascribing the former to the collective body of the Church, the latter to the representative: knowing that otherwise they could not preserve the distinction of Rulers and ruled in the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="66">Secondly, it is well knowne that in Con|gregations the greater part are not fit to exercise Jurisdiction, for they can not ex|amine the Doctrine and abilities of Mini|sters, how should they ordaine them? They can not judge of questions and controver|sies of faith, how shall they determine the same? They can not find out and disco|ver Hereticks, how shall they excommuni|cate them? It is answered that this evill proceedeth from another, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is too much sloth and oversight in the ad|mission of such as are to be members of a Congregation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mos est scripturae ita loquide parte tanquam de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to, sicut Co|rinthios in primis suae Epistolae par|tibus ita lau|dat Aposto|lus, tanquam omnes tales essent, cum essent lauda|biles quidam eorum, saith Augustine writing to Paulinus.</HI></NOTE>, and that they would be fit enough to doe their duty, if they were all Saints, they meane appearantly, and in the judgement of charity such, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.7. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1, 2. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1, 1. But say we againe, 1. Why may wee not hold that when the Apostle writeth to the Saints at <HI>Rome,</HI> at <HI>Corinth, &amp;c.</HI> he meaneth not, that all who were in those Churches, were either truely or ap|pearantly Saints (for some wicked ones there were among them, and manifestly vi|tious, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16, 17, 18. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.9.11.) But that his meaning is, to direct his Epi|stles to so many as were Saints at <HI>Rome, Co|rinth, &amp;c.</HI> mentioning them alone; be|cause to them, and to none but them, did
<PB N="113" REF="66">
God send his word for a blessing, it being sent to others that they may <HI>goe and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and ta|ken,</HI> as the Prophet speaketh. 2. If it should be granted that the <HI>Apostle</HI> giveth the name of <HI>Saints</HI> to all and every one that were in the Churches of <HI>Rome, Corinth,</HI> and <HI>Ephesus,</HI> yet Mr. <HI>Ainsworth</HI> himselfe answering Mr. <HI>Bernard</HI> holdeth that they are called Saints by externall calling onely, wherewith many are called who are not chosen, and who have no appearant markes of election. Others say that they were called Saints, in respect of their baptisme, wherein they were all consecrated and devoted to God. Some say that they were all Saints, in respect of their profession. 3. Howsoever it was that they were all called Saints, yea put the case they had beene all truely Saints, surely their san|ctification can not import their fitnesse to exercise jurisdiction in the Church. The former is a speciall grace of the holy Spi|rit given to one for his owne Salvation: The other is a common gift of the Spirit, given for the benefit of the Church.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it were not possible to exercise ju|risdiction by a whole Congregation without
<PB N="114" REF="67">
great confusion and disorder: therefore this way cannot be from God, who is not the author of confusion but of order. If it be answered, that order may be kept in a Congregation exercising Iurisdiction as well as in a Nationall, at least in a Oecu|menicall Synod, where there will be as great a multitude, and peradventure grea|ter, then there is in a well-bounded Con|gregation. Wee reply it is not so much the multitude, which should make disor|der in the exercise of Jurisdiction by a whole Congregation (though indeed in many Congregations the multitude alone would hinder order) as the rudenesse of the vulgar sort, who if they should all speake their judgement, what a monstrous and un|avoidable confusion should there be? The members of Nationall and Oecumenicall Councils, are supposed to be men of know|ledge and discretion, and so may be kept in good order, much more easily then a rude multitude in the Congrega|tion.</P>
<P>They who are of another judgement ob|ject to us: First, our Saviours precept, <HI>Matth.</HI> 18.17. <HI>Where hee biddeth us not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell the Eldershish, but tell the Church.</HI> Ans. By the Church he meaneth the representa|tive
<PB N="115" REF="67">
body of the Church, even as that which was spoken to the Elders of <HI>Israel, Exod.</HI> 12.21. was said to be spoken by all the Con|gregation of <HI>Israel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Supra part</HI> 1. <HI>cap</HI> 4 <HI>e. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> c.</HI> 11.</NOTE> <HI>Ib. verse</HI> 3. and he who was judged by the Elders, was said to bee judged by the Congregation, <HI>Ios.</HI> 20.6. More of this place we say elsewhere. Next they object the example of excommunica|tion by the whole Congregation of <HI>Corinth,</HI> for the Apostle sheweth that it was the du|ty of the whole Congregation, to cast out that incestuous man. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.13.4.9.13. In like manner hee writeth to them all, to receive him againe, when he had repented, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6.8, 9. Answer. Whether the power of excommunication <HI>in actu pri|mo seu quo ad esse,</HI> did belong to the col|lective body of the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> or not, is a question controverted, and to this day <HI>sub judice lis est,</HI> yet even those who hold the affirmative part of the question, doe notwithstanding say, that <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> secun|do seu quo ad operari,</HI> the power pertained onely to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> body of that Church which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esbytery: which is also confirmed by 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6. where the Apostle speaking of the censure of that incestuous man, saith not, that it was

Hee was judged and sentenced by those <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is by the Pastors and Elders of <HI>Corinth,</HI> howbeit the execution &amp; finall act of that high censure, was to be with the consent and in the pre|sence of the Congregation.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it is objected, that <HI>Matthias</HI> was chosen by the whole number of the Disciples, <HI>Act.</HI> 1. and so were the <HI>Dea|cons</HI> chosen, <HI>Act.</HI> 6. and <HI>Elders</HI> in every City were made <HI>per</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, the Congre|gation signifying their suffrages by the lif|ting up or stretching forth of their hands, <HI>Act.</HI> 14.23. Therefore Jurisdiction ought to be exercised by whole Congregations. Answ. This Argument faileth two waies, 1. Though ordination of Office-bearers in the Church be an act of Jurisdiction, it doth not appeare that the election of them is an act of jurisdiction likewise. Though the solemnizing of marriage be an act of authority, yet the choice and desire of the parties is not an act of authority. 2. Or (if you will) election of Ministers is one of the Rights and Priviledges of the Church, yet no act of jurisdiction. 3. And if electi|on were an act of authority and jurisdicti|on,
<PB N="117" REF="68">
yet the alleadged examples prove no more but that this act of jurisdiction is to be exercised by the whole body, <HI>in Ecclesia constituenda, non constituta.</HI> It may bee so indeed in Churches at their first erection, but being once erected, and all necessary Office-bearers therein planted, from thence|forth the election of <HI>Elders</HI> pertaineth to the <HI>Presbytery,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De pol. Eccl. l.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 12&punc;</NOTE> to the <HI>Pastor</HI> and <HI>Elders,</HI> as <HI>Zepperus</HI> writeth, though still with the con|sent of the Church.</P>
<P>Fourthly, it is objected, that what con|cerneth all ought to be done with the con|sent of all. Answ. Wee hold the same, but the consent of all is one thing, the ex|ercise of jurisdiction by all, another thing. <HI>Ainsworth</HI> in one of his Epistles to <HI>Paget,</HI> condemneth the Elderships sitting and jud|ging matters apart from the Congregation.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arrone, pag.</HI> 23.</NOTE> <HI>Paget</HI> answereth, that though the Eldership sit apart to judge, yet before any sentence be given for the cutting off of any offen|der, or for any other thing which con|cerneth all, matters are first propoun|ded to the whole Church, and their prayers and consent required.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="69">And surely this forme of proceeding shi|neth forth to us in that Apostolicall Synod at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> for the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Elders,</HI> met, sate, and voiced apart from the whole Church, as <HI>Calvin</HI> noteth from <HI>Act.</HI> 15, 6. and they alone judged and decreed <HI>Act.</HI> 16.4. In the meane while were matters made knowne to the whole Church, and done with the consent of all, <HI>Act.</HI> 15.22.</P>
<P>If it be objected from <HI>verse</HI> 12: that the whole multitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was present in the Synod: I answer, we may understand with <HI>Piscator</HI> the multitude there spoke~ of to be the mul|titude of the <HI>Apostles</HI> &amp; <HI>Elders, V.</HI> 6. or if we should understand by the multitude the whole Church, this proveth onely that the whole Church heard the question disputed, not that they were all present at the judging and determining of it. If it be further ob|jected that the Synodall Epistle came not onely from the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Elders,</HI> but from the brethren, that is, the whole Church. The answer is easie. The Brethren are mentioned, because it was done with their knowledge, consent, and applause.</P>

<PB N="119" REF="69">
in the words which the <HI>Separatists</HI> them|selves (doubtlesse perpending the Reasons above-mentioned) have set downe in the 14. Article of the Confession of their Faith published, <HI>Anno</HI> 1616&punc; for this they say. <HI>Wee judge each proper Pastor, may and ought to bee trusted by the Congregation, with the mana|ging of all points of their Ecclesiasticall af|faires and Government, so farre, that he with his assistants doe execute and administer the same: yet so that in matters of waight, the whole Congregation doe first understand there|of, before any thing be finished, and the finall act bee done in the presence of the whole Con|gregation, and also that they (the said Con|gregation) doe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot manifestly dissent there|from.</HI> We are heartily content, that Congre|gations doe fully enjoy all the Christian liberty, which here is pleaded for in their behalfe, yea and much more also; for the assistants spoken of in these words of the Confession, are other Pastors and Collea|gues, if any there be, in the same Congrega|tion, as will bee evident to any that readeth that Article.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the independencies of the Elderships of particular Congregations.</HEAD>
<P>WEE have now rolled away one stone of offence, but there is another in our way.

to exercise the foresaid jurisdiction in all points.</P>
<P>I am debtor to D. <HI>Field,</HI> for answering one of those questions before propounded, concerning <HI>Ruling Elders,</HI> and here it falls in my hand. He asketh whether the power of Church-government and jurisdiction, doth belong to the Pastor and Elders of every Congregation, or to the Pastors and Elders of many Congregations joyned together in a Common Presbytery. I beleeve his ex|pectation was, that while as we would sayle through betwixt the <HI>Caribdis</HI> of Episcopall tyranny, and the <HI>Scylla</HI> of popular Anarchy, wee should not know ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to direct our course, but should certainly either bee swal|lowed up in the waves of mighty difficul|ties, or split our selves upon hid Rockes of division. Our danger, I hope, is not so great as he did imagine; for we hold that the parti|cular Elderships of severall Congregations have their owne power and authority of Church-government, but with a subordina|tion unto the common or greater Presbyte|ry, whose power is superior and of a larger extent.</P>
<P>First, then we shall take into considerati|on, the bounds of the power of particular Elderships, and how the same may be said to be independent, and how not, for this pur|pose,
<PB N="124" REF="72">

<P>The second distinction is betwixt Con|gregations,
<PB N="125" REF="72">
<HI>which have a competent and well-qualified Eldership, &amp; small Congregations, who have but few office-bearers, and those (it may be) not sufficiently able for</HI> Church-govern|ment. <HI>In this case of insufficiencie, a Congre|gation may not independently, by it selfe, exer|cise jurisdiction, and not</HI> in re propria, <HI>saith</HI> Parker.</P>
<P N="3">3. He distinguisheth betwixt the case of right administration, and the case of aberra|tion: whatsoever liberty, a Congregation hath in the former case, surely in the latter it must needs be subject and subordinate. <HI>If particular Elderships doe rightly manage their owne matters of Church-government, the grea|ter Presbytery shall not need for a long time (it may be for some yeares) to intermeddle in any of their matters, which wee know by expe|rience in our owne Churches.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hee maketh a distinction betwixt the case of appellation and the case, <HI>de nulla ad|ministratione mala praesumpta.</HI> Though the particular Eldership hath proceeded aright, though it consist of able and sufficient men, and though it bee <HI>in re propria,</HI> yet if one think himselfe wronged, and so appeale, then is it made obnoxious to a higher consistory,

<P N="5">5. Adde unto these a distinction betwixt a Congregation, lying alone in an Iland, Province, or Nation, and a Congregation bordering with sister Churches. If either there be but one Congregation in a King|dome or Province, or if there be many farre distant one from another, so that their Pa|stors and Elders cannot ordinarily meete together, then may a particular Congrega|tion doe many things by it selfe alone, which it ought not to doe, where there are adjacent neighbouring Congregations, together with which, it may, and should have a common Presbytery.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let us put a difference betwixt the sub|ordination of one Congregation to ano|ther, or of ore Eldership to another, and the subordination of any Congregation, and of
<PB N="127" REF="73">
the Eldership thereof to a superior, Presby|tery or Synod made out of many Congre|gations, as one provinciall Synod is not sub|ject to another Provinciall Synod, yet all the Provinciall Synods in the Nation are subje<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Nationall Synod, so it is also with the ordinary consistories, one particu|lar Eldership is not subject to another, yet all the particular Elderships within the bounds of the common Presbytery are sub|ject to the same. So that there is a vast dif|ference betwixt this subordination which we maintaine, and the subordination of all the Parishes in a Diocesse to the Praelate and his Cathedrall. Where <HI>Douname</HI> doth object that all the Parishes of <HI>Geneva</HI> are Hierarchically subject to the Presbytery in the city, <HI>Parker</HI> denieth this, <HI>nisi quis &amp;c. vnlesse</HI> saith he,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De pol. Ec. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 23.</NOTE> <HI>peradve~ture one may be subject to himselfe, for the Parishes, each for their owne part, and that alihe, are this same Pres|bytery.</HI> And after, <HI>Consistorium &amp;c. for the Consistory of the Cathedrall Church is an ex|ternall meeting, divers distinct and separate from the rurall Churches, which are no part thereof, this cannot be said of the Presbytery of Geneva.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Wee must distinguish betwixt a de|pendance absolute, and, in some respect, a Congregation doth absolutely depend upon
<PB N="128" REF="74">
the holy Scriptures alone, as the perfect rule of faith and manners, of worship and of Church-government, for we accurse the ty|ranny of Prelates, who claimed to them|selves an autocratoricke power over Congre|gations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spotswood <HI>Serm. at Perth. assemb.</HI></NOTE> to whom they gave their naked will for a Law. One of themselves told a whole Synod that they ought to esteeme that best which seemeth so to Superiors, and that this is a sufficient ground to the conscience for obeying, though the thing be inconvenient. We say, that Congregations ought indeed to be subject to Presbyteries and Synods, yet not absolutely, but in the Lord, and in things lawfull, and to this purpose the constituti|ons of Presbyteries and Synods are to bee examined by the judgement of Christian discretion, for a Synod is <HI>Iudex Iudicandus,</HI> and <HI>Regula regulata,</HI> so that it ought not to be blindly obeyed, whether the ordinance be convenient or inconvenient.</P>
<P>Last of all we are to distinguish betwixt the condition of the Primitive Churches, before the division of Parishes, and the state of our Churches now after such division. At the first when the multitude of Chri|stians in those great cities of <HI>Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, &amp;c.</HI> was not divided into severall Parishes, the common Presbytery in the
<PB N="129" REF="74">
city did suffice for the government of the whole, and there was no need of a particular consistory of Elders, for every assembly and Congregation of Christians within the city, except perhaps to admonish, rebuke, exhort, or to take notice of such things as were to be brought into the common Presbyterie. But after that Parishes were divided, and Christian Congregations planted in the ru|rall villages, as well as in the cities, from henceforth it was necessary that every Con|gregation should have at hand within it selfe, a certaine Consistory for some acts of Church-government, though still those of greater importance were reserved to the greater Presbyterie. And thus have J, out of desire to avoid unnecessary questions, set downe my conceptions concerning the El|derships of particular Congregations, and the power of the same.</P>
<P>If it be said, that <HI>I</HI> seeme to deny the di|vine right of the same, or that they have a|ny warrant from the patterne of the Aposto|like Churche. <HI>I</HI> answer. <HI>I</HI> acknowledge the conformity of the same with the patterne thus farre. 1. It is to bee suposed that in some small cities (especially the same not being wholly converted to the Christian faith) there was but one Christian Con|gregation, the Eldership whereof did
<PB N="130" REF="75">
manage matters of jurisdictio~ proper there|to. 2. Even in the great cities, at the first there was but one Congregation of Christi|ans, and so but one particular Eldership. 3. After that the Gospell had spread, and Chri|stians were multiplied in those great cities, it is true, they were all governed by a com|mon Presbytery, but that Presbytery was not remote, but ready at hand among the~selves. Now in this we keepe our selves as closse to the patterne, as the alteration of the Chur|ches condition by the division of Parishes will suffer us, that is to say, we have a com|mon Presbytery for governing the Congre|gations within a convenient circuit, but withall our Congregations have, <HI>ad manum,</HI> among themselves, an inferior Eldership for lesser acts of Government; though in respect of the distance of the seate of the common Presbytery from sundry of our Parishes, they can not have that ease and benefit of nearenesse, which the Apostolique Churches had, yet by the particular Elderships they have as great ease of this kinde as conveni|ently can be.</P>

third glosse. He saith, that the word Pres|byterie in this place signifieth the Ministers of the word, <HI>non juris vinculo sed ut cunque collectos, inter quos etiam Apostoli erant.</HI> Ans. 1. If so, then the occasionall meeting of Ministers, be it in a journey, or at a wed|ding, or a buriall, &amp;c. shall all be Presby|teries, for then they are <HI>ut cunque collecti.</HI> 2. The Apostles did put the Churches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bet|ter order, then to leave imposition of hands, or any thing of that kind to the uncertainty of an occasionall meeting. 3, The Apostles were freely present in any Presbyterie, where they were for the time, because the over|sight and care of all the Churches was layd upon them: Pastors and Elders were nece|ssarily present therein, and did by vertue of their particular vocation meete together Presbyterially, whether an Apostle were with them, or not.</P>
<P>No other sense can the Text suffer but that by <HI>Presbyterie</HI> we should understand <HI>consessus Presbyterorum,</HI> a meeting of <HI>Elders,</HI> and so doe <HI>Camero</HI> and <HI>Forbesse</HI> themselves expound it. <HI>Sutlivius</HI> objecteth to the con|trary, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did lay on hands upon <HI>Timothy,</HI> which he proveth both from 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. and, because extraordinary gifts were given by that laying on of hands. Ans. There is an expresse difference made betwixt
<PB N="133" REF="76">
<HI>Pauls</HI> laying on of his hands, and the <HI>Presby|teries</HI> laying on of their ha~ds. Of the former it is said, that <HI>Timothy</HI> received the gift, which was in him, <GAP DESC="foreign"> by the laying on of <HI>Pauls</HI> hands; but he received the gift <GAP DESC="foreign"> with the laying on of the hands of the <HI>Pres|byterie,</HI> as <HI>Didoclavius</HI> noteth. But saith <HI>Sutlivius, Timothy</HI> being an Evangelist (as you hold) how could hee be ordained by the <HI>Presbyterie</HI>? Ans. 1. Though the <HI>Presby|terie</HI> did neither give him ordination to bee an Evangelist, nor yet conferre by the lay|ing on of their hands extraordinary gifts up|on him, yet did they lay on their hands, as setting to the the Seale and Testimony, and commending him to the grace of God, even as certaine Prophets and Teachers layd hands on <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and <HI>Ananias</HI> also be|fore that time had laid his hands upon <HI>Paul.</HI> 2. The <HI>Presbyterie</HI> might ordaine <HI>Timothy</HI> to be an <HI>Elder. If so be he was ordained an El|der before he was ordained an Evangelist.</HI> 3. If the testimony of the <HI>Presbyterie,</HI> by the laying on of their hands, together, with the Apostles hands, in the extraordinary mission of <HI>Timothy,</HI> was required: much more may it be put out of question, that the Apostles committed to the <HI>Presbyt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry</HI> the full power of ordaining ordinary Ministers.</P>
<P>But it is further objected by <HI>Sutlivius</HI> that
<PB N="134" REF="77">
this could not be such a Presbyterie as is a|mong us, because ordination and imposition of hands pertaine to none, but the Ministers of the word.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Num.</HI> 8.10.</NOTE> Ans. 1.

Howsoe|ver our practice (wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch is also approved by good Divines) is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iun. cont.</HI> 5. <HI>lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 3. <HI>Synod. pur. theol. dyp.</HI> 42. <HI>thes.</HI> 37.</NOTE> to put a difference betwixt the act of ordination and the externall right thereof, which is imposition of hands, ascri|bing the former to the whole Presbytery both Pastors and Elders, and reserving the lat|ter to the Ministers of the word, yet to bee done in the name of all.</P>
<P>Thus have we evinced the Apostles mea|ning, when he speaketh of a Presbyterie, and this Consistory we find to have continued in the Christian Church in the ages after the Apostles.

though they discharged the ordaining of Bi|shops in villages, lest the name of a Bishop should grow contemptible, did neverthelesse allow every City to have a Bishop of its owne. What hath Doctor <HI>Forbesse</HI> now gai|ned by maintaining that the bounds of a Presbyterie, and of a Diocesse were all one? They in the <HI>Netherl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds</HI> sometime call their Presbyteries <HI>Diocaeses</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Bucer. de gub.

Wee conclude there was anciently a Presbytery in every City which did indeede choose one of their number to preside a|mong them, and to lay on hands in name of the rest, and hee was called the Bi|shop; wherein they did more trust the de|ceiveable goodnesse of their owne intenti|ons, then advert to the rule of the Word of God.</P>
<P>These things premitted, I come now to that which is principally intended, <HI>viz.</HI> by what warrant and <HI>qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> jure,</HI> the Classicall Presbyterie among us, made up out of many neighbouring congregations, should be the ordinary Court of Ecclesiasticall Jurisdicti|on, at least in all matters of highest impor|tance, which doe concerne either all or any of those congregations.</P>
<P>For resolution hereof we must understand
<PB N="137" REF="79">
1. That causes common to many congrega|tions, ought not to be judged by any one of them, but by the greater Presbytery com|mon to them all. 2. It is to bee supposed that particular congregations (at least the farre greatest part of them) have not in their pro|per Elderships so many men of sufficient abi|lities, as are requisite in judging and deter|mining the cases of the examination of Mi|nisters, of ordination, deposition, excommu|nication, and the like. 3. When one appea|leth from a particular Eldership, out of per|swasion that hee is wronged by the sentence thereof, or when that Eldership finding its owne insufficiency for determining some difficult causes, resolveth to referre the same into a higher Court: reason would that there should be an ordinary Court of a Classicall Presbytery to receive such appellations or references. 4. Congregations which lye neare together, ought all as one to keep unity and conformity in Church policy and go|vernment, neither ought one of them be per|mitted to doe an injury, or to give an offence unto another: and for these ends, it is most necessary that they be governed by one com|mon Presbytery. 5. There may be a competi|tion or a controversie not only betwixt one congregation and another, but in the same
<PB N="138" REF="80">
congregation betwixt the one halfe and the other; yea, the Eldership it selfe of that con|gregation, may be, (and sometimes is) divi|ded in it selfe. And how shall things of this kinde bee determined, but by the common Presbytery? 6. But (which is <HI>caput rei</HI>) these our Classicall Presbyteries have a certaine warrant from the paterne of the Apostolicall Churches: For proofe whereof, it shall bee made to appeare, 1. That in those Cities, (at least in many of them) where Christi|an religion was planted by the Apostles, there were a great number of Christians, then ei|ther did, or conveniently could meet toge|ther into one place for the worship of God. 2. that in those Cities there was a plurality not onely of ruling Elders, but of the Mini|sters of the word. 3. That notwithstanding hereof, the whole number of Christians within the Citie, was one Church. 4. That the whole number, and severall companies of Christians within one Citie, were all gover|ned by one common Presbytery. The se|cond of these doth follow upon the first, and the fourth upon the third.</P>
<P>The first proposition may bee made good by induction of particulars; and first, it is more then evident of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> where wee finde unto 120 Disciples, Act. 1.15. added
<PB N="139" REF="80">
8000. by <HI>Peters</HI> two Sermons, Act. 2.41. and 4.4. Besides whom, there were yet more multitudes added. Act. 5.14. And after that also, wee read of a further multiplication of the Disciples, Act. 6.1. by occasion whereof the seaven Deacons were chosen and ordai|ned: which maketh some to conjecture, that there were seven congregations, a Deacon for every one. Certainly there were rather more then fewer, though wee cannot deter|mine how many. It is written of <HI>Samaria,</HI> that the people with one accord gave heed unto <HI>Philip,</HI> Act. 8.6. even all of them both men and women, from the least to the grea|test, who had before given heed to <HI>Simon</HI>: of these all it is said, that they beleeved <HI>Philip,</HI> and were baptised, vers. 10.12. which made the Apostles that were at <HI>Ierusalem</HI>&punc; when they heard that the great City <HI>Samaria</HI> had received the word of God, to send unto them <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iohn,</HI> the harvest being so great, that <HI>Philip</HI> was not sufficient for it, v. 14.

Now these two, the multitude of Christians, and the want of Temples, shall abundantly give light to my first proposition.</P>
<P>But it may bee objected to the contrary, that all the Disciples at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> did meet together <GAP DESC="foreign">, into one place, Act. 2.44. And the same is said of the Church of <HI>Co|rinth,</HI> 1 Cor. 11.20. Ans. The disciples at <HI>Ieru|salem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers. 46.</NOTE> being at that time above 3000. it can|not be co~ceived how any private house could cotain them. Beside, it is said, that they brake bread that is, did celebrate the Lords Sup|per from house to house. Therefore many good interpreters understand by <GAP DESC="foreign">, that all the Disciples were linked together in|to
<PB N="142" REF="82">
one by amity and love, an evidence where|of is given in the next words, <HI>and had all things common.</HI> To the other place wee an|swer: 1. That Epistle, whether it were writ|ten from <HI>Philippi,</HI> or from <HI>Ephesus,</HI> was un|doubtedly written very lately after the plan|tation of the Gospel in <HI>Corinth,</HI> while as that Church was yet in her infancie. And if it should bee granted, that at that time the whole Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> might and did meet together into one place, this proveth not that it was so afterward: for the Churches increa|sed in number daily, Act. 16.5. But, 2. the place of the Apostle proveth not that which is alledged: for his words may be understood <HI>in sensu distributivo.</HI> It was no solecisme for one that was writing to divers congregations, to say, <HI>When yee come together into one place,</HI> meaning distributively of every congrega|tion, not collectively of them all together.</P>
<P>My second proposition concerning the plurality of the Ministers of the Word in those great Cities, wherein the Apostles did erect Christian Churches, ariseth from these grounds, 1. The multiplicity of Christians. 2. The want of Temples, of which two I have already spoken. 3. The daily increase of the Churches to a greater number, Acts 16.5.4. There was need of preachers, not
<PB N="143" REF="82">
only for those who were already converted in the City, but also for labouring to winne the unbelievers who were therein. These reasons may make us conclude that there were as many Pastors in one City as there were sacred meetings therein, and some more also for the respects foresaid. And what will you say if we finde examples of this plu|rality of Pastors in Scripture? Of the Bishops or Pastors of the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> said, that <HI>Paul</HI> kneeled down, <HI>and praied with them all, and they all wept sore,</HI> Acts 20.36.37. compared with verse 28. Here is some good number imported. To the Angell of the Church of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> that is, to the Pastors thereof collectively taken, Christ saith, <HI>The Divell shall cast some of you into prison,</HI> Revel. 2.10. which (if not only yet) principally is spoken to the Pastors, though for the be|nefit of that whole Church. This is more plaine of the Church of <HI>Thyatira,</HI> verse 24. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Vnto you I say, &amp; to the rest in Thyatira:</HI> as if he would say, saith <HI>Pareus, Tibi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">spicopo cum collegis &amp; reliquo coetui dico. Paul</HI> writeth to the Bishop at <HI>Philippi,</HI> Phil. 1.1. and notwithstanding that there was al|ready a certaine number of Bishops or Pa|stors in that City, yet the Apostle thought it necessary to send unto them <HI>Epaphroditus</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="83">
also, Phil. 2.25. being shortly thereafter to send unto them <HI>Timotheus,</HI> verse 19. yea to come himselfe, verse 24. so that there was no scarcity of labourers in that harvest. <HI>Epaphras</HI> and <HI>Archippus</HI> were Pastors to the Church at Colosse, and who besides we cannot tell, but <HI>Paul</HI> sent unto them also <HI>Tychicus,</HI> and <HI>Onesi|mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> Col. 4.7.9.</P>
<P>Now touching the third proposition, no man who understandeth, will imagine that the multitude of Christians within one of those great Cities was divided into as many parishes as there were meeting places for worship. It is a point of controversie, who did beginne the division of parishes; but whosoever it was, whether <HI>Evaristus,</HI> or <HI>Hi|ginus,</HI> or <HI>Dionysius,</HI> certaine it is, that it was not so from the beginning, I meane in the daies of the Apostles, for then it was all one to say, <HI>in every City,</HI> or to say, <HI>in every Church.</HI> That which is <GAP DESC="foreign">, Tit. 1.5. is <GAP DESC="foreign"> Acts 14.22. This is acknowledged by all Anti-prelaticall writers so farre as I know, and by the Prelaticall writers also.</P>
<P>The last proposition, as it hath not beene denyed by any, so it is sufficiently proved by the former, for that which made the multi|tude of Christians within one City to be one Church, was their union under and their
<PB N="145" REF="83">
subjection unto the same Church governe|ment and governours. A multitude may bee one Church, though they doe not meete to|gether into one place for the worship of God: for example, it may fall forth, that a congre|gation cannot meet together into one, but into divers places, and this may continue so for some yeares together, either by reason of persecution, or by meanes of the plague, or because they have not such a large parish-Church as may containe them all, so that a part of them must meete in some other place: but a multitude cannot be one Church, unlesse they communicate in the same Church government, and under the same Governours, (by one Church I meane one Ecclesiasticall Republike;) even as the like union under civill government and gover|nours maketh one corporation: when the Apostle speaketh to all the Bishops of the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 20.28.</NOTE> hee exhorteth them all to take heed to all the flocke, <GAP DESC="foreign">, over which the holy Ghost had made them overseers, so that the whole was go|verned by the common counsell and advice of the Elders, as <HI>Hierome</HI> speaketh: for the same reason we say not the Churches, but the Church of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> because all the Pastors and Elders have the charge&punc; and
<PB N="146" REF="84">
governement of the whole.</P>
<P>From all which hath beene said, I inferre this Corollary, <HI>That in the times of the Apo|stles, the Presbytery which was the ordinary Court of Iurisdiction, which did ordaine, depose, excommunicate, &amp;c. did consist of so many Pa|stors and Elders, as could with conveniency meete ordinarily together, which is a paterne and warrant for our Classicall Presbyteries.</HI> I confesse there might be in some townes no greater number of Christians then did meet together in one place, notwithstanding whereof the Pastor or Pastors and Elders of that congregation, might and did manage the government of the same, and exercise ju|risdiction therein. I confesse also that in those Cities wherein there was a greater number of Christians then could meet together into one place for the worship of God, the Pres|bytery did consist of the Pastors and Elders within such a City: for it cannot be proved that there were at that time any Christian congregations in Landward Villages (the persecution forcing Christians to choose the shelter of Cities, for which reason many are of opinion that the Infidells in those daies were called <HI>Pagani,</HI> because they alone dwelt in <HI>Pagis</HI>) and if there had beene any such adjacent to Cities, we must thinke the
<PB N="147" REF="84">
same should have beene subject to the com|mon Presbytery, their owne Pastors and Elders being a part thereof. Howsoever it cannot be called in question that the Presby|tery in the Apostolicall Churches, was made up of as many as could conveniently meete together, for managing the ordinary matters of Jurisdiction and Church-government. The Pastors and Elders of divers Cities could not conveniently have such ordinary meetings, especially in the time of persecuti|on; only the Pastors and Elders within one City had such conveniency. And so to con|clude, we doe not forsake, but follow the paterne, when we joyne together a number of Pastors and Elders out of the congregati|ons in a convenient circuit, to make up a common Presbytery, which hath power and authority to governe those congregations; for if the Presbytery which we find in those Cities wherein the Apostles planted Chur|ches, bee a sure paterne for our Classicall Presbyteries (as wee have proved it to bee) then it followeth undeniably that the autho|rity of Church-government, of excommuni|cation, ordination, &amp;c. which did belong to that Primitive Presbytery, doth also be|long to those our Classicall or greater Pres|byteries.</P>

<PB N="148" REF="85">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the authority of Synods Provinciall and Nationall.</HEAD>
<P>TOuching Synods, I shall first shew what their power is, and thereafter give arguments for the same. The power of Jurisdiction which wee ascribe un|to Synods, is the same in nature and kinde with that which belongeth to Presbyteries, but with this difference, that Presbyteries doe exercise it in an ordinary way, and in matters proper to the congregations within their circuit. Synods doe exercise this pow|er in matters which are common to a whole province, or nation; or if in matters proper to the bounds of one Presbytery, it is in an extraordinary way; that is to say, when ei|ther Presbytery hath erred in the managing of their owne matters, or when such things are transferred to the Synod from the Pres|bytery, whether it be by appellation or by reference.</P>
<P>The power of Jurisdiction, whereof I speake is threefold, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign">. So it is distinguished by our writers,
<PB N="149" REF="85">
and all these three doe in manner foresaid be|long unto Synods. In respect of Articles of faith or worship, a Synod is <HI>Iudex</HI> or <HI>Testis</HI>: In respect of externall order and policie in circumstances, a contriver of a Canon, or <GAP DESC="foreign"> In respect of heresie, schisme, obstinacie, contempt and scandall, <HI>Vindex:</HI> not by any externall coactive power (which is peculiar to the Magistrate) but by spirituall censures.</P>
<P>The dogmaticke power of a Synod, is not a power to make new Articles of faith, nor new duties and parts of divine worship, but a power to apply and interpret those Articles of faith, and duties of worship which God hath set before us in his written Word, and to declare the same to be inconsistent with emergent heresies and errours. To this pur|pose it is that the Apostle calleth the Church <HI>the pillar and ground of truth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 3.15.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, not <GAP DESC="foreign">, which may be expounded ei|ther <HI>in sensu forensi,</HI> the Church is the pub|licke witnesse, notifier and keeper of truth; even as in Courts and places of judgement, there are pillars to which the Edicts of Ma|gistrates are affixed, that people may have no|tice thereof: or <HI>in sensu architectonico</HI>&punc; as the Church by her faith is built upon Christ, or (w^c^h is all one) upon the doctrine and truth of
<PB N="150" REF="86">
Christ, contained in the writings of the Pro|phets and Apostles, and leaneth thereto: so by her Ministery she upholdeth, under-pro|peth, and conserveth this same truth, lest, as the Prophet speaketh, <HI>Truth fall in the streets, &amp; perish among men.</HI> Truth standeth fast in the Church, and is kept firme, while it is profes|sed, preached, propugned and maintained a|gainst all contrary errour and heresie. In the same sense saith the Apostle, that unto the Jewish Church <HI>were committed the Oracles of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 3.2.</NOTE> by them to be kept, interpreted, propa|gated, &amp;c.</P>
<P>By the Diatakticke power a Synod may institute, restore, or change, according to the condition and exigence of the Church, the externall circumstances in the worship of God, and Ecclesiasticall discipline: I meane those circumstances which are common both to civill and sacred Societies, the conve|niencie whereof is determinable by the light of Nature, alwayes observing the generall rules of the Word, which commandeth that all bee done to the glory of God, that all bee done to edifying, that all bee done in order and decencie, that we give none offence, that wee support the weake, that we give no place to the enemies of the truth, nor symbolize with Idolaters, &amp;c. Now for avoiding dis|order
<PB N="151" REF="86">
and disconformity in a Nation profes|sing one Religion, it is fit that Nationall Sy|nods give certaine directions and rules even concerning these rites and circumstances, not having therein an Arbitrary or Autocratorke power, but being alwayes tied to follow the rules foresaid.</P>
<P>The Criticke power of a Synod, is not a Lordly imperious dominiering over the flocke of Christ, which is not to bee ruled with force and cruelty; but it is the power of spirituall censures, as excommunication, deposition, and the like, most necessary for the repressing of heresie, errour, obstinacie in wickednesse, and scandals, otherwise in|corrigible. Without this power, schismes and offences could not bee cured, but should the more increase; whileas liberty is left to heretickes, schismatickes, and obstinate per|sons, without any censure to pester and di|sturb a whole Nation, without any regard to the constitutions of a Nationall Synod.</P>
<P>But may one say, if the Decrees of a Synod concerning matters of Faith or Worship, may and ought to bee examined by the sure rule of the word of God, and onely to be re|ceived when they doe agree therewith; and if also the constitutions of a Synod in exter|nall circumstances, doe not binde, except <HI>ex
<PB N="152" REF="87">
aquo &amp; bono,</HI> and <HI>propter justas mandandi causas</HI>: or, as Divines speak, <HI>in casu scanda|li &amp; contemptus,</HI> and not for the meere will or authority of a Synod; and if therefore all Christians are by the private judgement of Christian discretion, following the light of Gods Word and Spirit, to try and examine all decrees and constitutions of any Synod whatsoever, to know whether they may law|fully receive the same, as our Divines main|taine and prove against Papists. If these things be so, it may seeme contrary to Chri|stian liberty, and to the Doctrine of Prote|stant Writers, that Synods should exercise the foresaid Criticke power, or inflict any spirituall censures, at least upon those who professe, that after examination of the de|crees or constitutions, they cannot bee per|swaded of the lawfulnesse of the same.</P>
<P>Ans. 1. Our Divines by those their tenents, meane not to open a doore to disobedience and contempt of the ordinances of a Synod, but onely to oppugne the Popish errour con|cerning the binding power of Ecclesiasticall lawes, by the sole will and naked authority of the law-maker, &amp; that Christian people ought not to seek any further reason or motive of o|bedience. 2. A Synod must ever put a dif|ference betwixt those who out of a reall
<PB N="153" REF="87">
scruple of conscience, doe in a modest and peaceable way, refuse obedience to their or|dinances, still using the meanes of their bet|er information, &amp; those who contemptuously or factiously disobey the same, labouring with all their might to strengthen themselves in their errour, and to perswade others to be of their minde. 3. This objection doth mi|litate no lesse against Ecclesiasticall censures in a particular congregation, then in a Natio|nall Synod. And they who doe at all ap|prove of Church censures to be inflicted up|on the contemptuous and obstinate, shall put in our mouthes an answer to objections of this kinde.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. The first Argument for the authority of Synods, and the subordination of Pres|byteries thereto, taken from the light of nature.</HEAD>
<P>HAving now described the power of particular Elderships (which we call Sessions) of Classicall Presbyteries, and of Synods, Provinciall and Nationall,
<PB N="154" REF="88">
it remaineth to confirme by Arguments the subordination and subjection of the particu|lar Elderships, to the Classicall or common Presbytery, of both to the Provinciall Sy|nod, and of all these to the Nationall Assem|bly: So that every one may perceive what reason the Church of Scotland hath to give unto the higher Ecclesiasticall Courts autho|rity over the lower.</P>
<P>I might insist long enough both in the Te|stimonies of Protestant Writers, and in the examples of the reformed Churches abroad, as also in the examples of all the ancient Churches, all speaking for this authority of Synods. But these I shall passe, because I know Arguments from Scripture, and reason, are required, and such we have to give.</P>
<P>First of all I argue from the very light &amp; law of nature. That same light of nature which hath taught our Common-wealth, beside the Magistrates and Councells of particular Burghs, to constitute higher Courts, for whole Shires, Baliveries, Stuartries, Regali|ties; and above all these, the supreame Court of Parliament to governe the whole Nation, hath also taught our Church to constitute Synods Provinciall and Nationall, with power and authority above Presbyteries. Wee are farre from their minde who would
<PB N="155" REF="88">
make Policy the Mistresse, and Religion the Handmaid, and would have the government of the Church conformed to the government of the State as the fittest paterne. But this we say, in all such things as are alike common to the Church and to the Common-wealth, and have the same use in both, whatsoever natures light directeth the one, it cannot but direct the other also; for as the Church is a company of Christians subject to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw of God, so is it a company of men and wo|men who are not the outlawes of nature, but followers of the same. It is well said by one, <HI>Hoc certissimum est &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.B.A.C. de Polit. civil. &amp; Eccles. p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g. 43.</NOTE> <HI>This is most certaine, that the Church is a certaine kinde of Republike&punc; for it hath all those things which all Re|publikes must need, have, but t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th them in a different way, because it is not a Civill&punc; but an Ecclesiastic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll Republike.</HI> And againe, <HI>Est ergo, &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o that this Republike is much more perfect then all others, and therefore cannot but have the things which they have that are in dignity farre inferi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur to it.</HI> So saith <HI>Robinson</HI> in his justif. of separ. pag. 113. <HI>The visible Church,</HI> saith he, <HI>being a politie Ecclesiasticall and the perfect on of all polities, doth comprehend in it whatsoever is excellent in all other bodies politi|call.</HI> Now so it is, that while as some hold the government of the Church to bee Monarchi|call,
<PB N="156" REF="89">
others Aristocraticall, others Democra|ticall, others mixed of all these; they all ac|knowledge that the Church is a Republike, and ought to bee governed even as a Civill Republike, in things which are alike com|mon to both: of this kinde are Courts and Judicatories, which doe alike belong to both, and have the same use in both, <HI>viz.</HI> for rule and government; therefore as na|tures light doth undeniably enforce diversity of Courts in the Common-wealth, some par|ticular, some generall, some lower, some higher, and the latter to have authority over the former, it doth no lesse undeniably en|force the like in the Church, for <HI>de paribus idem judicium.</HI> It cannot bee denyed that the Church is led by natures light in such things as are not proper to religious holy uses, but alike common to civill societies, at least in so farre as they are common to sacred and civill uses. The Assemblies of the Church in so farre as they treat of things Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall, after a spirituall manner, for a spirituall end, and doe consist of spirituall Office-bearers as the members constituent, in as farre they are sacred, and the Church is therein directed by the Word of God alone; yet the having of Assemblies and Consisto|ries, and divers sorts of them, and the lower
<PB N="157" REF="89">
subordinat to the higher, all this is not sacred nor proper to the Church, but common with her to the Common-wealth, nature com|mending therein to the one, what it com|mendeth to the other.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The second Argument, taken from Christs Institution.</HEAD>
<P>AS wee have Nature, so have wee Christs Institution for us, and this shall appeare two wayes. First, the fidelity of Christ, both in his Propheticall &amp; in his Regall or Nomotheticall power, was such, that he hath sufficiently provided for all the necessities and exigences whatsoever of his Churches, to the end of the world. Therefore the Apostle calleth him as faith|full in all the house of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 3.2.</NOTE> as ever <HI>Moses</HI> was, who delivered lawes serving for the go|vernment of the Church of the Jewes in all cases. Whence we collect, that the autho|rity of Classicall Presbyteries over the El|derships of particular congregations, and the authority of Synods over both, must needs have a warrant from Christs owne Institu|tion,
<PB N="158" REF="90">
because without this authority, there are very important necessities of the Chur|ches, that cannot be helped. For example, in most congregations, especially in Dorps and Villages, when a Pastor is to be ordained, the particular Eldership within the congregation can neither examine and try his gifts, and his, soundnesse in the faith, (which examination must necessarily precede his ordination;) nor can they discover him, in case he be a subtile and learned hereticke; nor yet can they pray in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e congregation over him which is to be ordained, and give him publicke exhortation and admonition of his duty, God having neither given to the Elders of every congre|gation, nor yet required of them such abili|ties. What shall be done in this case?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Paget Chap. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Ains|worth</HI> would have the worke stayed, and the Church to want a Minister, till she be able to doe her workes, and her duties which are proper to her. Alas! bad Christ no greater care of the Churches then so? shall they be destitute of a Pastor, ever till they be able to try his gifts and soundnesse, and to exhort and pray at his ordination? and how shall they ever attaine to such abilities except they bee taught? and how shall they bee taught without a Teacher? Now the power and authority of Classicall Presbyteries, to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in
<PB N="159" REF="90">
Pastors in particular congregations, shall cut off all this deduction of absurdities, and shall supply the Churches need. I may adde a|nother instance concerning the Classicall Presbytery it selfe. What if the one halfe thereof turne to be hereticall, or it may bee the major part? They shall either have most voyces, or at least the halfe of the voyces for them, and there shall bee no remedy, unlesse the authoritative determination of a Synod be interposed.</P>
<P>Secondly, the will of Christ for Provin|ciall and Nationall Assemblies to bee over Presbyteries, even as they are over the El|derships of particular congregations, appear|eth also in this. He hath given us in the new Testament, expresse warrant for Ecclesiasti|call Courts and Assemblies in generall, that such there ought to be, for the right govern|ment of the Church, Matth. 18.20. <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</HI> Act. 15.6. <HI>And the Apostles and Elders came together for to consider of this matter.</HI> From these and the like places, it is plaine, that Christ willeth jurisdiction to bee exercised, and controver|sies to bee determined by certaine Consisto|ries and Assemblies. Of the exercise of ju|risdiction is the first place, which I have cited
<PB N="160" REF="91">
to bee understood, as the cohesion thereof with the purpose which went before, shew|eth. Of determining questions of faith, and enacting lawes concerning things in their owne nature indifferent, is the other place to be understood, as wee shall heare af|terward. So then, wee truely affirme of Ec|clesiasticall Assemblies in generall, that po|wer is commited by Christ unto them, to exercise jurisdiction, to determine questions of faith, and to make constitutions about things indifferent, in the case of scandall. Now the severall sorts of these Assemblies are not particularly determined in Scripture, but left to be particularly determined by the Church, conforme to the light of Nature, and to the generall rules of the Word of God. And the particular kindes of Assem|blies appointed by the Church, conforme to the light and rules foresaid, doe fall within the compasse of those precepts which are <HI>Divine-Ecclesiastica</HI>: they are mixed (though not meere) divine ordinances. Even as the Scripture warranteth times of fasting, and times of thankesgiving, shewing also the cau|ses and occasions of the same, and the right manner of performance; but leaveth the par|ticular dayes of fasting and thankesgiving to be determined by the Church, according to
<PB N="161" REF="91">
the rules of the Word. In like manner, the Scripture commendeth the renewing of the covenant of God in a Nation that hath bro|ken it, but leaveth the day and place for such an action to be determined by the Church, according to the rules foresaid. Now if the Church following the generall warrant and rules of the Word, command to fast such a day, to give thankes such a day, to renew the covenant of God such a day; these things are divine ordinances mixedly, though not meerely; and he who disobeyeth, disobeyeth the commandement of God. The like may be said of catechising, and of celebrating the Lords Supper, (which are not things occa|sionall, as the former, but ordinary in the Church:) they are commended by the war|rants of Scripture, but the particular times and seasons not determined. The like wee say of the order to be kept in baptisme, and in excommunication, which is not determi|ned in the Word, though the things them|selves be. The removing of scandals, by putting wicked persons to publike shame, and open confession of their faults in the Church, hath certaine warrant from Scrip|ture, yet the degrees of that publike shame and punishment, are left to be determined by the Church, according to the quality
<PB N="162" REF="92">
of the scandall, and the rules of the Word. Now the Church appointeth some scanda|lous persons to be put to a greater shame, some to a lesser, some to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Sabbath in the place of publike repentance, some three, some nine, some twenty five, &amp;c. And if the of|fender refuse that degree of publike shame which the Church, following the rules fore|said appointeth for him, hee may be truely said, to refuse the removing and taking away of the scandall, which the Word of God in|joyneth him, and so to disobey not the Church only, but God also. Just so the Scripture having commended unto us the governing of the Church, the making of Lawes, the exercise of Jurisdiction, the de|ciding of controversies, by Consistories and Assemblies Ecclesiasticall, having also shew|ed the necessity of the same, their power, their rule of proceeding and judging, who should sit and voice in the same, &amp;c. But leaving the particular kindes, degrees, times, bounds, and places of the same to be resol|ved upon by the Church, according to the light of naturall reason, and generall rules of the Word: The Church for her part, fol|lowing the generall warrant and rules fore|said, together with the light of nature, hath determined and appointed Assemblies,
<PB N="163" REF="92">
Provinciall and Nationall, and to exercise respectively that power which the Word giveth to Assemblies in generall. The case thus standing, we may boldly maintaine that those particular kinds and degrees of Eccle|siasticall Assemblies, are Gods owne ordi|nances mixedly, though not meerely.</P>
<P>But what can bee the reason, may some man say, why the Scripture hath not it selfe determined these kinds of Assemblies parti|cularly. I answer, three reasons may be gi|ven for it: 1. because it was not necessary, the generall rules of the word together with natures light which directeth Common-wealths in things of the same kind, being suf|ficient to direct the Church therin. 2. As se|sons and times for the meeting of Assem|blies, so the just bounds thereof in so many different places of the world, are things of that kinde which were not determinable in Scripture, unlesse the world had beene filled with volumes thereof; for, <HI>Individua sunt Infinita.</HI> 3. Because this constitution of Sy|nods Provinciall and Nationall, is not uni|versall for all times and places: for example, there may be in a remote Island 10. or 12. Christian congregations, which beside their particular Elderships have a common Pres|bytery, but are not capable of Synods either
<PB N="164" REF="93">
Provinciall or Nationall. Againe, let there bee an Island containing forty or fifty Chri|stian congregations, there shall be therein, beside Presbyteries, one kinde of a Synod, but not two kindes. Besides, the reformed congregations within a great Nation, may happly be either so few, or so dispersed and distant, or so persecuted, that they can neither have Provinciall nor Nationall Assemblies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The third Argument, taken from the Iewish Church.</HEAD>
<P>IN the third place we take an Argument from the example of the Jewish Church; for as in their Common-wealth there was a subordination of civill Courts, every City having its proper Court, which did consist of seven Magistrates, if we beleeve <HI>Iosephus</HI>: the Thalmudicall tradition maketh two Courts to have beene in each City, the lesser of the <HI>Triumvirat,</HI> and the greater of twenty three Judges. Beside these, they had their supreame Consistory, the civill Sanedrim, which governed the whole Nation, and had
<PB N="165" REF="93">
authority over the inferiour Courts. So was there also a subordination of Ecclesiasticall Courts among them: they had a Consistory in every Synagogue, for their Synagogues were appointed not only for prayer and prai|sing of God, and for the reading and expoun|ding of the Scriptures, but also for publike correction of offences, Acts 26.11. They had besides, a supreame Ecclesiastical Court, whereunto the whole nation, and all the Synagogicall Consistories were subject. This Court having decayed, was restored by <HI>Ichoshaphat,</HI> 2 Chron. 19.8. and it had the name of <HI>Sanedrim,</HI> common to it with the supream civill Court. From this Court did the reformation of that Nationall Church proceed, Nehem. 6.13. <HI>On the second day were gathered together the chiefe of the fathers of all the people, the Priests and the Levits, un|to Ezra the Scribe, even to understand the words of the Law. And they found written in the Law, &amp;c.</HI> Whether there was yet another Ecclesiasticall Court, in the midle betwixt the Synagogue and the Sanedrim, called <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Presbytery, Luke 22.66. Acts 22.5. and made up possibly out of the particular Synagogues within the Cities, I leave it to learned men to judge: howsoever, it is plaine from Scripture, that there was at least a two|fold
<PB N="166" REF="94">
Ecclesiasticall Court among the Jewes the Synagogue and the Sanedrim, the latter having authority above the former.</P>
<P><HI>Sutlivius</HI> denyeth both these, and so would have us believe that the Jewish Church had no Ecc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esiasticall Court at all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Presbyt. pag. 25.</NOTE> As for the Sy|nagogues, he saith, they treated of things civill, and inflicted civill punishments, and a civill excommunication. That they inflicted civill punishment, he proveth from Mat. 10. and 23. and Luke 21. where Christ foretel|leth that his Disciples should bee beaten in the Synagogues. That their excomunication was civill, he proveth by this reason, that Christ and his Disciples when they were cast out of the Synagogues, had notwithstanding a free entry into the Temple, and accesse to the sacrifices. <HI>Answ.</HI> This is a grosse mistake; for 1. the civill Court was in the gate of the City, not in the Synagogue. 2. He who pre|sided in the Synagogue was called <HI>the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue,</HI> Acts 18.8.17. the rest who sate and voiced therein, were called <HI>the Rulers of the Synagogue,</HI> Acts 13.15. They who sate in the civill Court had no such names, but were called Judges. 3. Our Saviour distinguisheth the Synagogicall Courts from the civill Courts of judgement in Cities, calling the one Councells, the o|ther
<PB N="167" REF="94">
Synagogues, Matth. 10.17. 4. The bea|ting and scourging in the Synagogues was an errour and abuse of the later times, the cor|rective power of those Consistories being properly spirituall, and ending in excommu|nication, Jo. 16.2. Isai. 66.5. the liberty of which spirituall censures the Romans did permit to the Jewes, together with the li|berty of their religion, after they had taken away their civill Jurisdiction. 5. Civill ex|communication is an unknowne word, and his reason for it is no lesse unknowne; for where he hath read that Christ or any of his Disciples were excommunicate out of the Synagogues, and yet had free accesse to the Temple, I cannot understand, if it be not in the Gospell of <HI>Nicodemus.</HI> I read, Luke 4.28.28. that Christ was in a great tumult cast out of the City of <HI>Nazareth</HI>&punc; but this I hope no man will call excommunication. The blinde man, Joh. 9.34. was indeed excom|municated out of the Synagogue, but wee no where read that hee was thereafter found in the Temple: we read of Christs walking in <HI>Solomons</HI> porch, Jo. 10.23. but that the blinde man was then with him, it can never be proved, and if it could, it should not im|port any permission or leave given to excom|municate persons to enter into the Temple,
<PB N="168" REF="95">
but that some were bold to take this liberty. 6. The casting out of the Synagogue cannot be called civil excommunication, because the communion and fellowship of the Jewes in the Synagogue was not civill, but sacred: they met for the worship of God, and not for civill affaires. 7. If by civill excommunica|tion he meane banishment, or casting out of the City (for I conceive not what other thing this strange word can import) then how doth he suppose that they had still free accesse to the Temple, who were so excommunicated, for this importeth that they were still in the City.</P>
<P>Wee have now evinced an Inferiour Ec|clesiasticall Court among the Jewes. Come we next to the supreame Court. That there was an high Ecclesiasticall Sanedrim, di|stinct from the Civill Sanedrim, is observed by <HI>Pelargus</HI> on Deut. 17. and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pingius ad bonam fidem Sibrandi. pag.</HI> 261. <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> Be|side many others cited before, <HI>part.</HI> 1. <HI>chap.</HI> 11. And that it was so, wee prove from three places of the old Testament, to passe other places, from which certaine collections may be had to the same purpose.</P>
<P>First, we finde Deut. 17. a distinction of two supreame Judicatories, to bee set in the place which the Lord should choose to put
<PB N="169" REF="95">
his name there, the one of the Priests &amp; Levi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, the other of the Judges: &amp; unto these two su|preame Courts, the Lord appointed all mat|ters which were too hard for the inferiour Judges in the Cities of the Land, to bee brought and determined by their authority, and the sentence of the Priests or of the Judges to be obeyed both by the parties and by the inferiour Judges, under pain of death, v. 8.9.10.11.12.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Presbyt&punc; pag. 16.</NOTE> To this <HI>Sutlivius</HI> answereth, that there is only one Sanedrim in that place, which was civill, as appeareth by their jud|ging of the causes of blood, and their recei|ving of appellations from the civill Judges mentioned in the preceding Chapter. As for the Judge which is spoken of v. 9. and 12. he saith, we must understand that it was the high Priest. <HI>Ans.</HI> 1. The disjunctive <HI>Or</HI> doth distin|guish the Judges from the Priests, verse 12. as <HI>Iunius</HI> and <HI>Ainsworth</HI> doe rightly note up|on that place: <HI>The man that will doe presump|tuously, and will not hearken unto the Priest (that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God) or unto the Iudge.</HI> Here a distinction be|twixt the Court of the Priests and the Court of the Judges, which <HI>Lyranus</HI> also acknow|ledgeth. 2. The Chaldee readeth <HI>Iudges</HI> in the plurall. By the Judge, saith <HI>Ainsworth,</HI> is understood the high Councell or Senat of
<PB N="170" REF="96">
Judges, even as they who are called Priests, verse 9. are called the Priest, verse 12. and 1 Chron. 4.42. many Captaines are in the Hebrew called <HI>an head.</HI> 3. The high Priest cannot be understood to bee the Judge there spoken of, both because there were many Judges, as hath beene said, and because wee finde not in Scripture that ever the high Priest was called by the name of the Judge. 4. Whereas hee objecteth that the causes of blood, and other civill causes were judged in this Sanedrim. Wee answer, there were two severall things in those civill causes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De gub. Eccl. cap. 2. p. 43.</NOTE> the <HI>Ius</HI> and the <HI>factum.</HI> The <HI>Ius</HI> was judged in the Court of the Priests, because as <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lson</HI> teacheth, the civill Law of the Jewes was Gods judiciall Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mal. 2.7.</NOTE> and it was to be sought at the Priests mouth. But the fact being meerely civill, was judged by the civill Court. <HI>Sutl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vius</HI> objecteth, that many incon|veniences shall follow this distinction. 1. Judges are hereby made ignorant of the Law. 2. That two Courts of judgement are appointed in one sentence. 3. That a Judge (the Priest) may give out a sentence which he cannot execute. 4. That the civill Judges doe in vaine inquire concerning the fact which was before certaine by the Law, <HI>nam ex facto jus oritur.</HI> 5. That the civill
<PB N="171" REF="96">
Judges are dumbe Images, which must pronounce according to the sentence of o|thers. To the 1. we say that our distinction doth not import that the Judges were igno|rant of the Law, but that it pertained not to them to judge the meaning of the Law, when the same was controverted among the Infe|feriour civill Judges: this pertained to the Court of the Priests. 2. It is no absurdity to expound a disjunctive sentence of two seve|rall Courts. 3. He who answereth meerely, <HI>de jure,</HI> hath nothing to doe with execution of persons more then theory hath to doe with practice, or abstracts with concrets. 4. The fact can never be certaine by the sen|tence, <HI>de jure.</HI> It is not the probation, but the supposition of the fact whereupon the expo|sition of the sence of the Law is grounded. 5. The cognition of the fact, not of the law, do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h belong to an Inquest in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they are <HI>Iudic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s fact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, non Iuris.</HI> Yet no dumbe Im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es I suppose. 6. Hee hath followed the Popish Interpreters, in making the Judge to be the High Priest forso they expound it for the Popes cause; yet they themselves ac|knowledge the distinction of <HI>Ius</HI> and <HI>factum.</HI> See <HI>Corn. a lapide. in Deut.</HI> 17.7. If error had not blinded this mans eyes with whom I deale, I should believe hee had beene
<PB N="172" REF="97">
flumbring when these things fell from his pen.</P>
<P>But to proceed, as these two Sanedrims were instituted in the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> so were they after decay or desuetude restored by <HI>Iehoshaphat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i supra p. 20.</NOTE>, 2 Chro. 19.8. <HI>Sutlivius</HI> answereth, that wee have here only one Sanedrim which judged both the Lords matters, and the Kings matters, and that it was not an Ecclesiasticall Court, because it judged causes of blood, and other civill causes wherein appellation was made from the Judges of the Cities. By the Lords matters, hee saith, are meant criminall and civill causes, which were to be judged ac|cording to the Law of the Lord; and by the Kings matters are meant, his patrimony and domesticke affaires. Answer 1. The Text di|stinguisheth two Courts, one which medled with the Lords matters, whose president was <HI>Amariah,</HI> the chiefe Priest: another which medled with the Kings matters, whose pre|sident was <HI>Zebadiah.</HI> This is so plaine, that <HI>Bonfierius</HI> the Jesuit on Deut. 17. though he maketh the Priests to have beene the Judges, yet acknowledgeth two distinct Courts, 2 Chron. 19. 2. The words vers. 8. must be understood respectively,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alt. dam. p. 24.</NOTE> as <HI>Didoclavius</HI> hath observed, which we explaine thus, <HI>Moreover in Ierusalem did Iehshoaphat set of the Levits,
<PB N="173" REF="97">
and of the Priests, and of the chiefe of the Fa|thers of Israel, for the judgement of the Lord,</HI> (that is for causes Ecclesiasticall) <HI>and</HI> (repeat, <HI>of the Levits, of the Priests, and of the chiefe of the Fathers of Israel) for controversies</HI> (about civill matters, saith <HI>Piscator.</HI>) So that some of them were appointed to judge the one, and some of them to judge the other, which pro|veth not either that the Courts were one, or that the same men sate in both, but only that some of the Priests and some of the Fathers of Israel were in both. 3. The Lords matters <HI>Lavater</HI> and <HI>Piscator</HI> expound to be matters Ecclesiasticall, the Kings matters to be things civill; and this exposition comprehendeth all things which did fall within the power of those Courts. But <HI>Sutlivius</HI> glosse doth not so, for there were sundry things to be judged which were neither the Kings domesticke affaires, not yet causes criminall or civill, such as were questions about vowes, questions about the meaning of the Law, and judging betwixt the holy and the prophane, betwixt that which was cleane and that which was uncleane. These and such like Ecclesiasticall causes he leaveth out, and they are indeed left out of the power of the civill Sanedrim, and reserved to the other, for in such contro|versies the Priests were to stand in judge|ment,
<PB N="174" REF="98">
Ezech. 44.23.24. Lastly, it is not to be thought, that the high Sanedrim should neede to be troubled with the Kings dome|sticke affaires, farre lesse that this should be made the one halfe of their commission.</P>
<P>Now as wee have the institution of these two supreame Courts, Deuter. 17. and the restitution of them both, 2 Chron. 19. so have we an example of both, Jerem. 26. For first, <HI>Ieremiah</HI> was condemned, as worthy of death, because hee had spoken against the Temple and the holy place, verse 8.11. and herein saith, <HI>Oecolampadius</HI> on that place, hee was a Type of Christ, against whom it was pronounced in the Councell of the chiefe Priests and Elders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 26.66.</NOTE> <HI>He is</HI> guilty of death. So did this Ecclesiasticall Court conclude ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st <HI>Ieremy, He is worthy of Death</HI>: yet the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rary was concluded in the civill Sane|drim, verse 10.16. <HI>This man,</HI> say they, <HI>is not worthy to dye, for he hath spoken to us in the Name of the Lord our God.</HI> As much as to say, you Priests have given sentence <HI>de jure</HI> a|gainst <HI>Ieremiah,</HI> but we finde he is not guilty of the fact whereof he is accused, for he hath spoken nothing but the truth which the Lord sent him to speake; therefore as you pronounced him worthy of death, upon supposition of the fact, wee now pronounce
<PB N="175" REF="98">
that he is not worthy of death, because wee finde him blamelesse of the fact. <HI>Sutclivius</HI> denieth that the Priests were <HI>Iudices Iuris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ubi supra pag. 28.</NOTE> and the Princes <HI>Iudices facti</HI>; only the Prin|ces did against the will of the Priests set <HI>Ieremiah</HI> free, whom they had destinated to death: But say I, he must either deny that <HI>Ieremiah</HI> was judged in two severall Courts, or not, if he deny it, the Text is against him: for that hee was judged in the Court of the Princes, it is plaine from verse 10.16. and that hee was judged in the Court of the Priests, is plaine also from verse 8.9. Where we finde the Priests comming together, nei|ther to reason with <HI>Ieremiah</HI> (for they had no such purpose as to give him leave to speake for himselfe) nor yet to accuse him; for that they do before the Princes, v. 11. Therefore it was to give sentence for their part against him, which they did; but if he grant that sen|tence was given in two Courts, I would gladly know what difference could bee made betwixt the one sentence and the other, ex|cept that difference, <HI>de jure,</HI> and <HI>de facto,</HI> es|pecially the same suting the Text so well as hath beene said.</P>
<P>Of the vestigies of those two supreame Courts still remaining in some sort distinct, in the daies of Christ, I have spoken before.
<PB N="176" REF="99">
And now to proceed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bertram. de polit. Jud. cap. 11. ex 18.</NOTE> Wee have proved the Antecedent of this our present Argument, concerning distinct Ecclesiasticall Courts among the Jewes, and the subjection of the lower unto the higher of the Synagogue unto the Sanedrim.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sutliv. de Pres. cap. 2.</NOTE>But we have yet more to doe, for the con|sequence of our Argument is also denyed both by the Prelaticall faction, and by others (whom wee are more sorry to contradict) holding that reasons fetcht from the Jewish Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robinson Just. of separ. p. 163.</NOTE> doe better fat the Prelats, then the Consistorians; howsoever now to fetch the forme of Government for the Church, from the Church of the Jewes, were, say they, to revive the old Testament. To me it seemeth strange, that both the one side, and the o|ther, doe when they please, reason from the formes of the Jewish Church, and yet they will not permit us to reason in like manner. The former goe about to prove the Prelacy by the high Priesthood, and the lawfull use of Organs in the Church, from the like in the Temple of <HI>Solomon.</HI> The latter doe argue, that a Congregation hath right not only to elect Ministers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See apolog. a|gainst the Ox|ford D.D. p. 47.48.59.62. Ro|binson Justis. p. 122.123.</NOTE> but to ordaine them, and lay hands on them, because the people of Israel laid hands on the Levits. That the maintainance of the Ministers of the Gospell,
<PB N="177" REF="99">
ought to bee voluntary, because under the Law, God would not have the Priests and Levits, to have any part or inheritance in the Land of Canaan, but to be sustained by the Offerings and Altars of the Lord. That the power of excommunication is in the body of the Church, because the Lord laid upon all Israel the duty of removing the uncleane, and of putting away leaven out of their houses at the feast of Passover. Is it right dealing now, to forbid us to reason from the forme of the Jewes. I will not use any further ex|postulation, but let the Reader judge. The truth is this, even as that which is in a childe, as he is a childe, agreeth not to a man, yet that which is in a childe, as he is <HI>animal rati|onale,</HI> agreeth also to a man: so what wee finde in the Jewish Church, as it was Jewish, or in infancy and under the pedagogy of the Law, agreeth not indeed to the Christian Church. But whatsoever the Jewish Church had, as it was a politicall Church, or Eccle|siasticall Republike (of which sort of things, the diversity and subordination of Ecclesia|sticall Courts was one) doth belong by the same reason to the Christian Church. I say further, though the Common-wealth and civill Policy of the Jewes, be not in all points a patterne to our civill Policy, yet I am sure
<PB N="178" REF="100">
it is no errour to imitate the civill policy of the Jewes, in such things, as they had, not for any speciall reason proper to them, but are common to all well constituted Common-wealths, and so wee may argue from their Common-wealth, that it is a good policy to have divers civill Courts, and the higher to receive appellations from the Inferiour, as it was among them. Shall wee not by the very like reason fetch from their Ecclesiasti|call Republike, diversity of Spirituall Courts, and the supreame to receive appel|lations from the Inferiour, because so was the constitution of the Jewish Church, and that under the common respect and ac|count of a politicall Church, and not for any speciall reason, which doth not concerne us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The fourth Argument, taken from Acts 15.</HEAD>
<P>THE example of the Apostolicall Churches, Acts 15. maketh for us. The Churches of <HI>Antioch, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Cilicia,</HI> being troubled with the question
<PB N="179" REF="100">
about the Jewish Ceremonies, the matter was debated and disputed at <HI>Antioch,</HI> the chiefe towne of <HI>Coelosyria,</HI> where <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were for the time. It is very pro|bable, that some out of the other Churches in that Province, as also out of the Churches of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> were present in that meeting and conference, for they were troubled with the very same question, no lesse then the Church of <HI>Antioch.</HI> Howsoever the matter could not be agreed upon in that meeting, but a refe|rence thereof, was made to a more generall assembly at <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and for that effect <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and others with them, were sent thither. All this is cleare by com|paring verse 2. with 23. Hereupon the Apo|stles and Elders did synodically come toge|ther at <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and decided the question, giving forth decrees to be observed by the particular Churches, Acts 15.6.28. and 16.4. We will not dispute what sort of Synod this was, only that it was a Synod with authority over many particular Churches and Congre|gations, and whereunto the meeting at <HI>An|tioch</HI> (whether it was provinciall, or Presby|teriall only) did referre the determination of the question about Jewish ceremonies.</P>
<P>It is answered by some. 1. That the reason of sending <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> to <HI>Hierusalem,</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="101">
was to know whether these teachers who pressed the observation of the ceremoniall Law had any such commission from the A|postles and Elders, as they pretended. 2. That there is here no Synod, nor assembly of the Commissioners of divers Churches, for there were no Commissioners from the rest of the Churches in <HI>Iudea, Galilee,</HI> and <HI>Samaria,</HI> mentioned Acts 9.31. nor from the Churches of the Gentiles mentioned Act. 14.23. neither were <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and the rest who went with them, Commissioners to represent the Church of <HI>Antioch,</HI> but mes|sengers only to make narration of the case. 3. Not only the Apostles and Elders, but the whole Church at <HI>Hierusalem</HI> met together. 4. If the resolution which was given, be con|sidered, as the judgement of the Church at <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> it was only her advice to her si|ster Churches, if otherwise considered, it was a decree absolutely Apostolicall, and divine Scripture by infallible direction from the holy Ghost, and for that reason imposed up|on all the Churches of the Gentiles, though they had no Commissioners there.</P>
<P>These answers had need to be stronger, be|fore that so many Fathers, Councells, and Protestant Writers, who have understood the matter otherwise should all bee put in an error.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="101">To the first wee reply, that the reason of sending <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> to <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> was not so much to know, whether these tea|chers had commission from the Apostles and Elders, to presse the keeping of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> as to get a resolution of the question it selfe, verse 2. <HI>about this question.</HI> Now the question was not what commission the Apo|stles had given to those teachers, but whether they should be circumcised, after the manner of <HI>Moses,</HI> verse 1.</P>
<P>To the second, we say, that if <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> were messengers to make narration of the case, certainely they were more then sufficient messengers, and there was no need of others to be joyned in message with them, so that it appeareth the rest who were sent with them were Commissioners to represent the Churches which sent them. Neither is it credible, but that all the Churches of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Cilicia,</HI> which were in the same case, with the Church of <HI>Antioch,</HI> did send their Commissioners also to <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> for other|wise, how could the Apostles and Elders have so certaine and perfect intelligence of the case of those Churches, verse 23. Beside it had beene a great neglect in those Chur|ches, if they had not sent some to <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> as the Church of <HI>Antioch</HI> did, for if it was
<PB N="182" REF="102">
expedient which <HI>Antioch</HI> did, they ought no lesse to have done it, their case being the same. Moreover it may be collected from verse 3. that the other Churches through which <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> passed in their journey, did send some companions along with them, to joyne with them in their errand, and to give their consent in the meeting at <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> unto that which was to be concluded. This is the observation of <HI>Cajetan, Mentzerus, Calvin, Gualther,</HI> and other Interpreters upon that place.</P>
<P>Lastly, it is no way probable, that the Apostles and Elders at <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> together with those who were sent from the Churches of <HI>Antioch, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and the other Churches through which <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> did travell, would come together without acquainting the rest of the Churches of Ju|dea, which were so neare at hand, and might so easily send their Commissioners to <HI>Hie|rusalem.</HI></P>
<P>To the third wee reply, that it cannot bee proved from the Text that the body of the Church of <HI>Hierusalem</HI> was present, but rather it appeareth from verse 6. that they were not present,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 1.</NOTE> as hath been said before.

more then consent to the decree.</P>
<P>To the last answer, it is containe that the conclusion of that meeting at <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> was not a naked counsell and advice, but a decree imposed with authority upon the Churches, Acts 15.28. and 16.4. and 21.25.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robinson ib</NOTE> And whereas it is affirmed, that the decree was meerely Apostolicall, and that the Elders did no more then consent thereto, even as the brethren did, this is ma|nifestly against the Text, for Acts 16.4. It is said of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas as they went through the Cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the Apostles &amp; Elders that were at Hierusalem.</HI> And Act. 21.25. all the Elders speaking to <HI>Paul,</HI> say, <HI>as touching the Gentiles which believe, wee have written and concluded that they observe no such thing.</HI> That this was spoken by al the Elders, is plain from v. 18.19.20. So then the Elders did de|creee, ordaine, and conclude these things to bee imposed upon the Churches of the Gentiles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whittak. con|trov. 3. de con|quaest. 3.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. The fifth Argument, taken from Geome|tricall proportion.</HEAD>
<P>AS is the proportion of 3. to 9. so is the proportio~ of 9. to 27. of 21. to 81. &amp;c. This rule of Giometricall proportion affoordeth us a fifth Argument for the point in hand. If we should grant the government of the Church to be popular, then by what proportion, one or two are subject to a whole congregation, by the same proportion is that congregation subject to a provinciall&punc; or a nationall congregation. I meane, if all
<PB N="185" REF="103">
the congregations in a province or a nation were assembled into one collective body (as all the males of the Jewes did assemble thrice in the yeare at <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and as in the daies of the Judges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jud. 20.1.</NOTE> the whole congregation of the children of Israel was assembled together in <HI>Mizpeh,</HI> as one man, from <HI>Dan</HI> even to <HI>Beersheba,</HI> foure hundred thousand men, to try the cause of the Levite, and to resolve what to doe there-anent, which meeting of the Nation, was ordered by Tribes, the Tribes by families, the families by persons) in that case any one particular congregation behoved to be subject to the generall congre|gation, by the same reason whereby one man is subject to the particular congregation, whereof he is a member, because the whole is greater then a part, and the body more then a member. Now the same rule holdeth in the representatives of Churches, whether we compare them with the collectives, or among themselves. If wee compare the re|presentatives with the collectives, then as one congregation is governed by the particular Eldership representing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, by the like proportion are 14. or 16. congregations governed by a Classicall Presbytery repre|senting them all: by the same proportion are all the congregations in a province subject
<PB N="186" REF="104">
to a Provinciall Synod: by the same ought all the congregations in a nation to be sub|ject to a nationall Assembly, all of them be|ing either mediatly or immediatly represen|ted in the same;<NOTE PLACE="marg">De pol. Eccl. p. 331.332.</NOTE> for as <HI>Parker</HI> saith well, many Churches are combined into one, in the very same manner, as many members are combined into one Church.</P>
<P>If we compare the representatives among themselves, then by what proportion, a par|ticular Eldership representing only one con|gregation, is lesse in power and authority, then a Classicall Presbytery which represen|teth many congregations? by the same pro|portion is a Classicall Presbytery lesse in power and authority then a Provinciall Sy|nod, and it lesse in authority then a Nationall Synod. So that the authority of Presbyte|ries whether Parochiall or Classicall being once granted, this shall by the rule of pro|portion inferre the authority of Synods. I know that Synods are not ordinary Courts, as Presbyteries are; but this and other dif|ferences betwixt them I passe: the argument holdeth for the point of authority, that Sy|nods when they are, have authority over all the Churches in a Province or a nation, even as Presbyteries have over the congregations within their bounds.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. The sixth Argument, taken from ne|cessity.</HEAD>
<P>WEE have another reason to adde, and it is borrowed from lawlesse ne|cessity, for without a subordination among Ecclesiasticall Courts, and the authority of the higher above the inferiour, it were utterly impossible to preserve unity, or to make an end of controversie in a Nation. A particular congregation might happily end questions and controversies betwixt the members thereof, and so keepe unity within it selfe (and not so neither, if the one halfe of the congregation be against the other) but how shall controversies betwixt severall congre|gations be determined, if both of them bee independent? how shall plurality of religi|ons be avoided? how shall an apostatizing congregation be amended?</P>
<P>It is answered: 1. If a particular congrega|tion neglect their duty, or doe wrong to a|nother, the civill sword may proceed against them to make them doe their duty. 2. A par|ticular congregation ought in difficult cases
<PB N="188" REF="105">
to consult with her sister Churches, for so much reason dictats, that in difficult cases, counsell should be taken of a greater number. 3. Sister Churches when they see a particular congregation doing amisse out of that relati|on which they have to her, being all in the same body, under the same head, may and ought to admonish her, and in case of gene|rall apostacy, they may withdraw that com|munion from her, which they hold with the true Churches of Christ.</P>
<P>But these answers are not satisfactory. The first of them agreeth not to all times, for in times of persecution, the Church hath not the helpe of the civill sword: a persecuting Magi|strate will bee glad to see either division or apostasie in a congregation; but so it is, that Christ hath povided a remedy, both for all the evills and diseases of his Church, and at all times. The Church (as was said before) is a Republike, and hath her lawes, Courts, and spirituall censures within her selfe, whe|ther there be a Christian Magistrate, or not.</P>
<P>The second answer leaveth the rectifying of an erring congregation to the uncertainty of their owne discretion, in seeking counsell from a greater number. And moreover, if this be a dictate of reason to aske counsell of a greater number, when the counsell of a few
<PB N="189" REF="105">
cannot resolve us, then reason being ever like it selfe, will dictate so much to a congregati|on, that they ought to submit to the authority of a greater number, when their owne autho|rity is not sufficient to end a controversie a|mong them.</P>
<P>To the third answer wee say, that every private Christian may and ought to with|draw himselfe from the fellowship and com|munion, either of one man, or of a whole congregation, in the case of generall apo|stasie. And shall an apostatizing congregation be suffered to runne to hell, rather then any other remedy should bee used, beside that (commonly ineffectuall) remedy which any private Christian may use? God forbid.</P>
<P>What I have said of congregations, I say also of Classicall Presbyteries. How shall sentence be given betwixt two Presbyteries at varience? How shall a divided Presbyte|ry be re-united in it self? How shall an Hereti|call Presbytery be reclaimed? How shall a negligent Presbytery be made to doe their duty? How shall a despised Presbytery have their wounded authority healed againe? In these and such like contingent cases, what re|medy can bee had, beside the authority of Synods?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Objections made against the authority of Synods, answered.</HEAD>
<P>THey who dislike the subordination of particular congregations unto higher Ecclesiasticall Courts, object against us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 18.17.</NOTE> our Saviours precept, <HI>Tell the Church.</HI> Wheresoever wee read in Scripture of a visible politicall Church, and not of the invisible Catholike Church, it is ever meant, say they, of a particular congregation, used to assemble in one place for the exercise of Gods publike worship; &amp; when the Scripture spea|keth of a whole Province or Nation, the plu|rall number is used, as the Churches of <HI>Gala|tia,</HI> the Churches of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> the Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> &amp;c. Wherefore our Saviour in those words did deliver the power of Ecclesiasti|call Jurisdiction, neither to Classicall Pres|byteries, nor to Synods, but to particular con|gregations only.</P>
<P>Answ. 1. This place proveth indeed that particular Churches have their owne power of Jurisdiction, but not that they alone have it. 2. Yea, it proveth that they alone have it
<PB N="191" REF="106">
not, for Christ hath a respect to the forme of the Jewes, as is evident by these words, <HI>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen or a Publican.</HI> Now we have proved that there was among the Jewes an high Ecclesiasticall Sanedrim, beside the particular Synagogicall Courts: So that by pointing out the forme of the Jewish Church, hee recommendeth a subor|dination, and not an independency of parti|cular Churches. 3. By the Church in that place is meant the competent Consistory of the Church, and so it agreeth to all Ecclesia|sticall Courts respectively. This sence is given by <HI>Parker,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pol Eccl. lib. 3. cap. 20. p. 318.</NOTE> though he be most tender in the vindication of the liberty of congregati|ons. <HI>Nam cum&punc; &amp;c.</HI> For, saith he, <HI>since Christ would have every man to be judged by his owne Church, Matth.</HI> 18. <HI>or if the judgement of his owne Church should displease him, yet ever it must be by the Church, that is, by a Synod of many Churches</HI> 4. As for the reason alled|ged for proofe of the contrary exposition, I oppugne it both by reason, and by their owne Tenents, and by Scripture. By reason, because the rule of Geometricall proportion (whereof we have before spoken) proveth a congregation to bee a part of a Nationall Church, even as one man is a part of a con|gregation; for as five is the hundreth part of
<PB N="192" REF="107">
five hundreth, so is five hundred the hundreth part of fifty thousand. By their own grounds, because they hold the forme of a visible Church, to consist in the uniting of a num|ber of visible Christians into one, by the bond of a holy covenant to walke in all the wayes of God. Then say I, we may say the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as the Churches of <HI>Scotland,</HI> because all the particular Chur|ches in <HI>Scotland,</HI> are united together into one, by the bond of a Nationall oath and cove|nant, to walke in all the waies and ordinances of God. By Scripture also, because Acts 8.1. we read of the Church at <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> not the Churches: Howbeit there were at that in|stant above eight thousand Christians at <HI>Hie|rusalem,</HI> and all these still in the City (for the first scattering of them followeth thereafter in that Chapter.) This great number, neither did, nor could usually assemble into one place for the worship of God, but they met <GAP DESC="foreign"> house by house, Acts 2.46. And whereas objection is made to the contrary from Acts 2.44. and 5.12. and 6.2. Wee have before answered to the first of these places, for it is to be expounded by Acts 4.32. they were in one; that is, they were of one heart, and of one soule. The second place may be expoun|ded of the Apostles, and the preceding
<PB N="193" REF="107">
words favour this exposition; but though it should be take~ of the multitude, it prove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h not their meeting together into one place for the worship, of God, for it was an extraordinary confluence, upon an extraordinary occasion of that which had befallen to <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira.</HI> The last place proveth no more, but an extraordinary and occasionall mee|ting, and it is also to be understood that they met <HI>turmatim,</HI> as foure hundred thousand men did assemble together, Jud. 20.1.</P>
<P>Another Scripturall instance we give from 1 Pet. 1.1. with 5.2. the Apostle writing to the dispersed Jewes in severall Provinces, calleth them all one flocke. Wee read that <HI>Laban</HI> had many flockes, Genes. 30.36.38. yet are they all called one flocke, verse 31.32. so were all the flockes of <HI>Iacob</HI> called one flocke, Genes. 32.7. and 33.13. In like man|ner every one of the particular Churches among those dispersed Jewes was a flocke, but compared with the whole, it was but a part of the flocke. It is no more absurd to say that a congregation is both a body, in respect of its owne members, and a member in respect of a Nationall Church, then it is to say, that every beleever considered by him|selfe, is a tree of righteousnesse, and a Tem|ple of God, yet compared with others, he is a
<PB N="194" REF="108">
branch of the Vine, and a stone of the Tem|ple, for all those waies is hee called in Scrip|ture.</P>
<P>Sundry particular flockes may bee called one flocke, three waies: 1. <HI>Respectu pastorum,</HI> when the same shepheards oversee &amp; take care of the whole. See an example both of the one kinde of shepheards, Luke 2.8. and of the other, Acts 20.28. 2. <HI>Respectu pabuli</HI>: So <HI>Paul Baynes</HI> speaking of the Low Countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dioces. tryall. pag. 21.</NOTE> where sundry congregations in one City make but one Church, saith, that the sheepe <HI>feed together into one common pasture, though they bite not on the same individuall grasse.</HI> 3. <HI>Respectu pedi,</HI> when many congregations are governed by the same Pastorall staffe of Ecclesiasticall Lawes and Discipline.</P>
<P>It is further objected, that Presbyteriall government and the authority of Synods, doe rob the congregations of their rights and liberties, no lesse then the Prelacy did; so that the Churches of Christ in the removall of Episcopacy, have changed <HI>Dominum</HI> only, not <HI>Dominium.</HI> Answer. There is a vaste dif|ference; for 1. Episcopall governement is Monarchicall, and Christ hath left no Eccle|siasticall Jurisdiction to bee exercised by one man. Presbyteriall and Synodicall governe|ment is partly democraticall, in respect of the
<PB N="195" REF="108">
election of Ministers and Elders, and the doing of matters of chiefest importance, with the knowledge and consent of congregations: partly aristocratical in respect of the parity of Presbyters and their consistorial proceedings and decrees. The Monarchicall part is Christs peculiarly. 2. The Prelacy permitteth not to congregations any act of their owne Church government, but robbeth them of their par|ticular Elderships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De pol. Eccl. pag. 358.</NOTE> which (as <HI>Parker</HI> well no|teth) the Classicall Presbyteries doe not. 3. <HI>It is one thing,</HI> saith <HI>Baynes, for Churches to subject themselves to a Bishop and Consistory,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ubi supra.</NOTE> <HI>wherein they shall have no power of suffrage: Another thing to communicate with such a Pres|bytery, wherein themselves are members and Iudges with others.</HI> 4. The congregations did not agree not consent to Episcopall govern|ment, but were sufferers in respect of the same, but they doe heartily agree to the go|vernement of Presbyteries and Synods, in witnesse whereof they send their Commissio|ners thither to concur, assist, &amp; voice. 5. Speci|all respect is had in Presbyteries and Synods, to the consent of congregations, in all matters of importance, which are proper unto the same. This the Prelacy did not regard. 6. Presbyteries and Synods doe not (which the Prelats did) imperiously and by their sole
<PB N="196" REF="109">
arbitrement domineer over congregations, for their power is directive only, ministeriall, and limited by the Lawes of God and Na|ture, and the lawdable Ecclesiasticall Lawes received and acknowledged by the congre|gations themselves. 7. Experience hath shewed us Presbyteriall and Synodicall go|vernment to bee, not only compatible with, but most conduceable for the supportment and comfort of congregations: whereas E|piscopall government draweth ever after it <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lam ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m,</HI> and a generall grievance of the Churches.</P>
<P>Some other objections there are, for obvi|ating whereof I shall permit and explane a distinction which shall serve to answer them all. We may consider a visible Church, ei|ther metaphysically or politically. It is one thing to consider men as living creatures endued with reason; another thing to con|sider them as Magistrates, masters, fathers, children, servants, &amp;c. So is it one thing to consider a visible Church as a society of men and women separated from the blinde world by divine vocation, and professing together the Gospell of Jesus Christ. Another thing to consider it as a political body, in which the power of Spirituall government and Juris|diction is exercised, some governing and some governed.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="109">These are very different considerations; for first, a visible Church being taken entita|tively or metaphysically, her members doe ordinarily communicate together in those holy things which fall under the power of order, which I may call <HI>sacra mistica</HI>; but being taken politically, her members com|municate together in such holy things as fall within the compasse of the power of Juris|diction, which I may call <HI>sacra politica.</HI> Se|condly, Infants under age being initiated in Baptisme, are actually members of the Church in the former consideration, but po|tentially only in the latter, for they neither governe, nor yet have the use of reason to bee subject and obedient to those that doe go|verne. Thirdly, one must necessarily bee a member of the Church metaphysically be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore he can be a member of the Church po|litically, but not contrariwise. Fourthly, many visible Churches have sometimes beene, and may bee without Officers, and so with|out Ecclesiasticall government and exercise of Jurisdiction for that time, yet still retai|ning the Essence of true visible Churches: whereas a Church which never yet had any Officers ordained therein (of which kinde there have beene many at the first conversion of a Nation to the Gospell) or which hath
<PB N="198" REF="110">
losed all her Officers by death or persecuti|on, is not for that time an Ecclesiasticall Re|publicke, nor can bee such till she have Offi|cers. This if they had observed who have taken so great paines to prove that there hath beene, and may bee a Church without Offi|cers, it should happily have made them thinke their labour l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st. It might also have taught <HI>Henry Iacob</HI> to distinguish betweene a Church visible and a Church ministeriall or politicall, and not to understand these three termes to be all one, as he doth in his L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter, bearing date the 4. of September 1611. pag. 9. Fiftly, my being a member of any one visible Church metaphysically, giveth me right and title to communicate with another visible Church (where for the time I am) <HI>in sacris misticis,</HI> such as the word, prayer, &amp;c. But my being a member of any one visible Church politically doth not give me right and title to communicate with another visible Church (where for the time I am) <HI>in sacris politicis</HI>&punc; such as ordination, deposition, ex|communication, &amp;c. Hereunto doth Master <HI>Robinson</HI> assent in these words, <HI>As a man once baptized is alwaies baptised,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Justifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 317.</NOTE> <HI>so is he in all places and Chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hes where hee comes (as a baptized person) to enjoy the common benefits of his bap|tisme, and to discharge the common duties which

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Every Christian congregation is a compleate Church or body of Christ meta|physically; that is, hath the compleate Es|sence of a true visible Church; yet every such congregation is not a compleate Ecclesiasti|call Republicke, except in some certaine cases whereof wee have spoken, Chap. 2.

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> If by the receiving of Christ, they meane the receiving of Christ on his throne, or the receiving of him in his ordinance of Church government, then wee deny their Assumption, for every company of faithfull people is not a Church politically, as wee have shewed already.

enjoy him in all his politicall ordinances, yet not independently, but by a certaine order and subordination. But if by the receiving of Christ, they meane receiving of him to salvation, or receiving of him by his Word and Spirit, wee grant, that not onely every company of faithfull people, but every parti|cular Christian hath right and title to enjoy him in the mystical ordinances of the Word, Prayer, &amp;c. as often as the same can be had; yea further, hath right and title to the fruit and benefit of Ecclesiasticall jurisdicton, the exercise whereof is committed by Christ to the officers of the Church, <HI>Intuitu Ecclesiae tanquam finis.</HI> But that every company of faithfull people, who have received Christ to salvation, hath right and title to enjoy him in his politicall ordinances, by their own ex|ercising of all Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, and that independently, this is more then either hath been, or can be proved.</P>

But I adde withall, it is to be likewise under|stood of every faithfull Christian: so that not onely every true Church, but every true member thereof, by vertue of this union, hath direct and immediate title to Christ, and to the benefit of all his ordinances for his edifi|cation and salvation.

God is our Father, Christ our elder brother, the holy Ghost our Comfor|ter, the Angels our keepers, heaven our inhe|ritance.

the sacrifices.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 161.</NOTE> That the whole nation of the Jewes was one Church, having reference to one Temple, one high Priest, one Altar; &amp; it being impossible that the whole body of a Nation should in the entire and personal parts meet and communicate together in the holy things of God, the Lord so disposed and or|dered, that that communion should bee had after a manner, and in a sort, and that was by way of representation: for in the Temple was daily sacrifice offered for the whole nationall Church. So the names of the twelve Tribes upon the shoulders of the Ephod, and upon the Breast-plate, and the twelve loaves of Shew bread, were for Israel signes of re|membrance before the Lord.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 162.</NOTE> That now the Church consisteth not (as then) of a Nation, but of particular Assemblies, ordinarily com|municating together in all the Churches ho|ly things: whence it commeth, that there are no representative Churches now, the founda|tion thereof, which is the necessary absence of the Church which is represented, being taken away in the new Testament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 163.191.</NOTE> That be|sides all this, if wee take the representative Church at Jerusalem for a paterne, then as there not onely hard causes were opened, and declared according to the Law, but also the sacrifices daily offered, and the most so|lemne

service performed without the pre|sence of the body of the Church: so now in the representative Churches, (such as Pres|byteries and Synods) consisting of Officers alone, there must be not onely the use of ju|risdiction, but the Word and Sacraments, whether people bee present or not: for how can there be a power in the Church of Offi|cers for the use of one solemne ordinance out of the communion of the body, and not of another?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. To set aside the sacrifices, &amp; other ceremonial worship performed at Jerusalem, the Synagogues among the Jewes had Gods morall worship ordinarily therein, as Prayer, and the reading &amp; expounding of the Scrip|tures. 2. Whatsoever the Synagogues had, or whatsoever they wanted of the worship of God, they had an Ecclesiasticall Consistory, and a certaine order of Church government: else how shall we understand the excommu|nication, or casting out of the Synagogue, the Rulers of the Synagogue, and the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue? (of which things we have before spoken.)</P>
<P>I will not here dispute whether every sin among the Jewes was either appointed to be punished capitally, or else to bee expiated by sacrifices; but put the case it were so, this proveth that no excommunication or Eccle|siasticall
<PB N="206" REF="114">
censure was not then necessary: for beside the detriment of the Common-wealth by the violation of the Law, which was pu|nishable by death; and beside the <GAP DESC="foreign"> and guiltinesse before God, the expiation where|of by the death of Christ was prefigured in the sacrifices, there was a third thing in pub|like sinnes, which was punishable by spiri|tuall censures, and that was the scandall of the Church, which could not be taken away by the oblations of the delinquent, but rather made worse thereby, even as now a publike offender doth not take away, but rather in|crease the scandall of the Church by his joy|ning in the acts of Gods worship, so long as there is no Ecclesiasticall censure imposed upon him; neither yet (to speake properly) was the scandall of publike offences punish|able by bodily punishments, but the Church being a politicall body had her owne Lawes, and her owne censures, no lesse then the Common-wealth. 3. As the Synagogues were particular Churches politically, so all of them collectively were one Nationall Church politically, governed by one su|preame Ecclesiasticall Sanedrim, which is the representative wee meant of in our Argu|ment. 4. But if we take the Nationall Church of the Jewes metaphysically, there was no
<PB N="207" REF="114">
representative thereof, unlesse it were all the males who came thrice in the yeare to <HI>Ierusa|lem.</HI> The daily offering of Sacrifices was not by a representative Church, but by the Priests: and though there were twelve loaves of Shewbread before the Lord, and the names of the twelve Tribes upon the brest|plate, this proveth not a Church representa|tive, but signes representative. 5. The body of the Church is now (as then) necessarily absent from the Consistorial actions of deba|ting and deciding matters of Church go|vernment, and of Jurisdiction; and so that which was called the foundation of a repre|sentative Church doth still remaine.</P>
<P>Now before I make an end, I must answer yet other two objections which have beene lately made.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ on his Throne. pag. 57.58.</NOTE> There is one who objecteth that the Assembly of the Apostles, Acts 15. can bee no president nor patterne for succee|ding ages: First, because the Apostles were inspired with the holy Ghost, which whol|ly guided them in all matters of the Church; so as in that their determination, they say ex|pressely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 15.28.</NOTE> <HI>It seemed good to the holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burthen.</HI> Now, what Synod in any age after the Apostles could ever say that they were infallibly inspi|red and assisted by the holy Ghost? Secondly,
<PB N="208" REF="115">
that injunction of the holy Ghost and of the Apostles was but <GAP DESC="foreign">, for that present time, for the avoiding of offences betweene Jewes and Gentiles. But the like we read not afterward in all the writings of the Apostles.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. I say with <HI>Whittaker, Posse alia, &amp;c. That other lawfull councells may in like manner affirme their Decrees to be the Decrees of the ho|ly Ghost,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contr. 3. de conc. quest. 6.</NOTE> <HI>if they be like unto this councell, and if they keepe the same rule which the Apostles did keep and follow in this councell, for if they decree and determine nothing but from the Scriptures, which was done in this councell; and if they ex|amine all questions according to the Scriptures, and in all their Decrees follow the voyce of the Scripture, then may they affirme that the holy Ghost hath so decreed.</HI> 2. If the Doctrine or exhortation of a Pastor well grounded upon the Scriptures bee the Word of God, then much more is the Decree of a Synod well grounded upon the Scriptures, the Decree of the holy Ghost. 3. That Assembly was not of the Apostles alone, but of the Apostles and Elders, neither did the Decrees proceed from the Apostles alone, but from the A|postles and Elders, Acts 16.4. and 21.25. and in the place which is now obje|cted, Acts 15.28. not the Apostles alone, but the Elders with them, say, <HI>It seemed good
<PB N="209" REF="115">
to the holy Ghost and to us.</HI> What the Elders did then, the Elders may doe now, for time hath not diminished their authority. 4. Nay, what the Apostles did in that Synod, the Elders may doe in a Synod now; for the Apostles then did nothing but in the ordina|ry and common way of disputing and deba|ting, comparing reason with reason, and sen|tence with sentence, and thereafter framing the Decree according to the light which they had by reasoning and by searching the Scrip|tures. But (which is most observable) the sentence of the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> in that Synod was very imperfect and defective; for he only disswadeth from imposing the yoke of the ceremoniall law upon the Churches of the Gentiles, but maketh no mention of any overture for avoiding the offence betwixt the Jewes and the converted Gentiles at that time, which I may suppose he would have done, if his light and judgement had carried him that farre: In this the Apostle <HI>Iames</HI> sup|plieth the defect of <HI>Peters</HI> sentence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apud Whit|tak. ubi supra.</NOTE> and pro|poundeth an overture which pleased the whole councell, and according to which the decree was given sorth. This made <HI>Luther</HI> to say that <HI>Iames</HI> did change the sentence of <HI>Pe|ter.</HI> And all this it pleased God so to dispose, that we might understand that Synod to bee
<PB N="210" REF="116">
indeed a president and paterne for ordinary Synods in succeding ages. 5. <HI>Henry Iacob</HI> in his third argument for the Divine Institution of the Church, saith: It is absurd and impos|sible, that the Text Matth. 18. was never un|derstood for 1500 yeares after Christ. Sure this Text, Act. 15. was never understood for that whole space, if the Assembly there men|tioned, be not a president to succeeding ages. 6. It maketh nothing against us, that he saith, the decree of the Apostles &amp; Elders, was for that present time onely; nay, it maketh for us: for in this also that Synod was a paterne to succeeding ages, forasmuch as Synods now have no power to make a perpetuall restraint from the practice of any indifferent thing, (such as was then the eating of bloud, and things strangled) but onely during the case of scandall. And moreover, the decree of the Apostles and Elders in that Synod, is also perpetuall, in so farre as it is conceived a|gainst the pressing of circumcision as neces|sary to salvation.</P>

If the parity and equality make a great confusion in the ordinary government by Synods, it shall make no lesse, but rather greater confusion in an extraordinary Synod: so that there is no ground for his restriction to that which is ordinary. 2.

That testimony doth only strike at the Councels of Bishops, and so maketh not against parity, but against imparity in Councels: And, to say the truth, wee have found in our owne experience, that Prelati|call Synods have not abated, but rather in|creased evils in the Church. 4. The words of <HI>Nazianzen</HI> (for he is the Father here meant of) are not to be understood against Synods, but against the abuse of Synods at that time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ubi supra, quaest. 1.</NOTE> And in this we must pardon him (saith <HI>Whit|taker</HI>) that he shunned all Synods in those e|vill times of the Church, when the Emperour <HI>Valens</HI> was opposite to the Catholicke faith,

<HEAD>A POST-SCRIPT, In answer to a Treatise very lately published, which is intituled, The Presbyteriall Governement examined.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen the Printer had done all except two sheets of my former Treatise, there came to my hands a peece against Presbyteriall Go|vernement, which promi|seth much, but performeth little. Though my time be very short, yet I trust to make an answer to it, as full as it deserveth.</P>
<P>It hath a magisteriall and high sound|ing title, undertaking the examination of Presbyteriall Governement. But Presby|teriall Government secretly smileth, be|cause
<PB N="2" REF="119">
while she was ready to say much more for her selfe, he did not put her to to it, lest himselfe should have been put <HI>ad metam non probandi.</HI> But he particularizeth himselfe, and telleth us he hath unfolded the weaknesse of our grounds, and dispro|ved our pretended proofs. The truth is, that the best of them &amp; the most of them he hath not touched. He addeth that hee hath proved out of the Word of God the liberty of the people in choosing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir own officers. This may be added <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aute,</HI> but <HI>caste,</HI> I am sure it is not. He would make the world beleeve that Presbyterians are a|gainst the peoples election of their officers, which is a calumny. He saith, he hath an|nexed certaine arguments, proving Pres|byteriall Governement to be contrary to the pattern which Christ hath left in the New Testament. These arguments shall be answered with no great difficulty. In this place I shall only say a word of them in generall. The man hath a notable facul|ty of proving that wherein the Presbyteri|ans do agree with him, and passing that wherein they disagree from him. Many humane testimonies and citations of wri|ters he mustreth together, to make a sim|ple reader beleeve that many are of his judgemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; But I find none of them all
<PB N="3" REF="119">
except two or three to affirme any thing which we deny. But why hath he taken all this paines? He will present it (forsooth) to the Kings most excellent Majestie, and to the right honourable Lords, and the ho|nourable house of Commons now assem|bled in Parliament. As if it were to be ex|pected that a popular and independant forme of Church government in every Congregation, which should most certain|ly open a doore to a thousand remedilesse confusions, may obtaine his Majesties roy|all assent, or the acceptation of the High Court of Parliament. Nay, brother, seek some other friends to your cause, for, if wise men be not too too much deceived&punc; the King and the Parliament in their great wisdome do fore-see, that whensoever E|piscopall government shall be removed, another form of Provinciall and nationall Church government must needs succeed unto it.</P>
<P>Now to come to the substance of his discourse; first hee maketh a quarrell against the Presbyteries of particular Churches (which are in <HI>Scotland</HI> called <HI>Sessions</HI>&punc;) then against all higher Consisto|ries in the Church.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 1.</NOTE> As for the Presbyteries of particular Churches, he judgeth them three wayes defective. First he requireth
<PB N="4" REF="120">
that all who are admitted into the compa|ny of Elders, even the governing or ruling Elders should be <HI>apt to teach</HI> and <HI>able to ex|hort with sound doctrine and convince gaine|sayers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 3.1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. 1.5.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.9.</NOTE> and that not only privately, or in the Consistory, but in the publick assembly al|so, if not exactly, yet competently.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Though ruling Elders ought to teach, exhort, rebuke, &amp;c. both in the Consistory, and privately from house to house, as the case of every family and per|son doth require (which is all that can be drawne from those alleaged places to <HI>Ti|mothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> if so be they ought at all to be extended to ruling Elders) yet there is no place of Scripture to prove that they ought to teach publikly in the Congrega|tion. 2. That expression <HI>if not exactly, yet competently</HI> is somewhat mysterious. 3. Ruling Elders are expresly distinguished from those that labour in the word and doctrine. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. and from these that teach or exhort, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.7, 8. 4. If ruling Elders shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">each publikly in the congre|gation <HI>ex officio,</HI> and with cure of soules (as they speak) why shall they not also mini|ster the Sacraments, which are pendicles and seals of the word, and therefore com|mitted to those, who are sent to the pub|lick preaching of the Gospell, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19.
<PB N="5" REF="120">
5. Though he speak here only of ruling Elders, yet I doubt he requireth of, at least will permit to all men that are members of the Church the same publick teaching and prophesying in the Congre|gation.</P>
<P>The second defect which he wisheth supplied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 2, 3.</NOTE> is, that the temporary ruling El|ders may be made perpetuall and for life, which he enforceth by foure reasons. This I assent unto providing he admit a distin|ction betwixt the office it selfe, and the ex|ercise of the same. The office of a ruling Elder ought to be for his life no lesse then the Pastors; yet must we not condemne those Churches which dispense with the intermission of their actuall attendance for a certaine space, and permit them to exercise their office by course, as the <HI>Levits</HI> did of old, whose example himselfe here taketh for a patterne.</P>
<P>The third thing he saith is of most mo|ment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 4.</NOTE> He doth complaine that the Elders do not administer their publik office pub|likly as they should, but only in their pri|vate Consistory. He doth permit them in|deed to meet apart for deliberation (whereof we shall here afterward) but he will have their Church-office which in the Lord they have received, to be executed
<PB N="6" REF="121">
publickly in the face of the Congregation. 1. Because an office publick in the nature, ought also to be publick in the administra|tion. 2. Because the reformed Churches cannot know their Elders whether they be good or bad, except by heare-say. 3. Because otherwise the Elders can not mi|nisterially take heed to the whole flock as they are warned to do, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28. <HI>Ans.</HI> 1. Ruling Elders do execute their office not only in the Consistory, but from house to house throughout al the bounds of the Co~|gregation; w^c^h may easily make the~ known to that Church where they serve, whether they be good or bad. 2. Their Consistoriall sentences in all matters of importance, such as ordination, Church censures, excom|munication, &amp;c. are made knowne to the whole Church. 3. He passeth a short cen|sure upon the reformed Churches. <HI>The re|formed Churches</HI> is a great word, but this man maketh a moat of it. 4. The place <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28. cannot helpe him, for ruling El|ders do feed and oversee the whole flock, both by discipline in the Consistory, and by taking heed to all the sheepe several|ly, as every one hath need, and in that re|spect may be called both Pastors and Bishops. Beside I doubt he can prove that place to be meant of ruling Elders. He
<PB N="7" REF="121">
He goeth on to make plaine what hee hath said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 5.</NOTE> by descending to some particulars in which the Elders office s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emeth especially to consist, and these are saith hee, The admitting of members into the Church, upon profession of faith made, and the reproving and censuring of obstina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of|fenders. These are the most frequent publike administrations of the office of Ruling Elders. And what of them? hee saith, as they leave the execution of these things, to the Elders alone in the setled and well ordered state of the Church, so doe they deny, that they can be rightly and orderly done, but with the peoples privity and consent. His restriction to the setled and well ordered estate of the Church, I cannot understand. Hee had done well to have explained what hee meaneth by that not setled, nor well orde|red state of the Church, in which he thinks it belongeth not to the Elders alone, to ad|mit or cut off members. His other ambi|guous expression I understand better, for by the peoples privity hee meaneth, that the people should heare the voyces and suffrages of the Elders, and by the peoples consent, hee meaneth the peoples voting with the Elders, as wee shall heare after|ward. That the admission of members,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 6.</NOTE>
<PB N="8" REF="122">
ought to bee with the peoples privity and consent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 6.</NOTE> hee will prove by two reasons. 1. Because wee finde in the acts of the A|postles, that men were received into the fellowship of the Church, and baptized publikely, and in the face of the congre|gation. 2. Because the whole communal|ty, being neerely to joyne with these that are admitted, ought to take knowledge of the profession of their faith. These rea|sons can neither conclude the peoples right of suffrage in this matter, nor so much are the peoples hearing of the suf|frages of the Elders: But only that the matter might not bee ended without the peoples knowledge and tacite consent. Beside there is no small difference to bee put betwixt the admission of Jewes, Infi|dells, and Hereticks, upon their profession of the true Christian faith, and the admis|sion of such as have transported them|selves from another Christian congregati|on, bringing with them a sufficient testi|monie of their holy profession of faith, and good conversation. In the meane while, Let the Reader note, that this dis|puter hath here in a parenthesis interlaced grosse anabaptistry, holding it a kinde of unorderly anticipation to baptise infants, who cannot give a confession of their
<PB N="9" REF="122">
faith. And within a few lines, he lets ano|ther thing fall from his pen, which smel|leth strongly of the Anabaptisticall tenent, concerning having all things common, even bodily goods.</P>
<P>But I proceed with him to the second head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 7.</NOTE> concerning excommunication, and Church censures by the Elders, with the peoples privity and consent. This he pro|veth by three arguments.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&punc; Tim. 5.20.</NOTE> 1. Because <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>These who sin, rebuke publikely, that o|thers also may feare</HI> a brave argument indeed. This charge is not given to ruling Elders; and if it had, it can neither prove the suf|frage of the people, nor their hearing of the suffrage of the Elders, but onely the execution of the sentence of the Elders, in the presence and audience of the con|gregation. 2. Hee argueth from these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 18.17.</NOTE> <HI>Tell the Church,</HI> where hee would make it appeare, that by the Church is not meant the Senate of Elders excluding the people;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 8.</NOTE> yea hee saith, that in this circum|stance now in consideration, it comes nee|rer the truth to expound the Church to be the Bishop, since neither Bishops nor their Court-keepers, doe exclude the people from their consistories. Sure I am, in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> (let others speake for themselves) The Bishops in their visitations, high Com|missions,
<PB N="10" REF="123">
Privie-conferences at Synod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (in which they passed their decrees) did exclude both the people, and the most part of the ministers. He thinkes it a course unheard of either among Jewes, Gentiles, or Christians, before this last age, that pub|like judgements should be privatly exer|cised, and without the peoples privity. This (if at all to the point) must be un|derstood, not of the finall execution, but of the judiciall sentence or decree. What then shall wee thinke that the Senators at <HI>Rome</HI> or the Areopagites at <HI>Athens,</HI> did ne|ver conclude or degree any thing, con|cerning a publike judgement, except in the audience and presence of the people. The Judges in Israel did sit in the gates of of the City, that all persons both poore and rich, great and small might have accesse unto them with their complaints, and that the sentence of judgement, might bee the more notorious &amp; exemplary&punc; being given forth and promulgat in the gates: This proveth not that the Judges did debate, voyce, and conclude all matters in the publike audience of the people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 9.</NOTE> It appea|reth rather that they were so accomodate, that they might doe these things apart from the multitude. It is too much for him, to affirme either that the Synagogues
<PB N="11" REF="123">
were places of civill conventions and judgements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 9.</NOTE> or that nothing was in the Sy|nagogues decreed without the peoples privity, while as hee hath given no proofe nor evidence at all for it.</P>
<P>You need not, my Masters be so curious in the notation of the name <GAP DESC="foreign">, which every smatterer in Divinity knoweth. But what of it? you say, the Elders (as such) are called, to wit, to their office of Elder|ship, but called out they are not, being themselves to call out the Church. It is true that the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> noteth not only a calling, or a gathering together, by ver|tue of verb <GAP DESC="foreign">, but also a separation by vertue of the particle <GAP DESC="foreign">. But I hope it is no paradox to say, that the Elders are both called or gathered together unto the El|dership, and called out or separate from the rest of the Church to that office. And it is as far from a Paradox to say that they who are called out cannot call out others, especially the one calling out being to an office, and the other calling out being from nature to grace.</P>
<P>He cannot think that the name, <HI>Ecclesia,</HI> Church, hath been used by any Greek Au|thor before the Apostles times, or in their dayes, or in the age after them, for the as|sembly of sole Governours in the act of their government. I shall first give Instan|ces

wee desire not to wrangle about names, so that the thing it selfe (which is the power and authority of the Officers sitting and judging apart from the people) be condescended upon. Yet let us see upon what grounds the name of a re|presentative Church is by this man so su|perciliously rejected. First, hee saith that no godly, no nor reasonable man will af|firme, that this representation is to be ex|tended to any other acts of religion, than these which are exercised in the gover|ning of the Church. But <HI>quo warrant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">?</HI> shall a man be both ungodly and unreaso|nable, for affirming that the Elders may and ought to represent the Church where they serve, in preferring a petition to the King and the Parliament, for a Reforma|tion, or in bearing witnesse of the desolate condition of the Parish through the want of a ministery, or in giving counsel to a Si|ster Church, though these bee not acts of governing the Church. Well: be it, as he saith, what great absurdity shall fellow? then (forsooth) it appertains to the people primarily and originally (under Christ) to rule and govern the Church, that is, them|selves. But who saith he will so say of a government not personall, but publique, and instituted as the Churches is. Surely,
<PB N="15" REF="125">
they who think the power to be originally in the people, might here easily reply that this is no more strange than to say, that the power which is primarily and originally in the body of a Kingdome, is exercised by the Parliament, which is the representa|tive therof. But because many learned men deny the power of Church government to be originally in the people, though others, (and those very learned too) doe affirme it: therefore to passe that, I shall serve him with another answer. For as we can defend the authority of Presbyteries and Synods without wrangling about the name of a re|presentative Church, so can we defend the name of a representative Church, without debating the question, whether the peo|ple have the power originally or not. May he therefore bee pleased to take notice of other grounds and reasons for the name of a representative Church, as namely, First, what the Elders, with the knowledge and tacite consent of the Church, doe approve or dislike, that is supposed to be approved or disliked by the whole Church, which importeth, that the Church is in some sort represented by the Senate of Elders. Se|condly, as wee say wee have seene a man, when haply wee have seene nothing but his head, or his face which maketh him
<PB N="16" REF="126">
knowne unto us, (whence it is that Pain|ters represent men unto us oft-times onely from their shoulders upward) so doe wee discern &amp; know a visible political Church, when we see in the Senate, as it were, the head and face thereof, the officers being as eyes, eares, nose, mouth, &amp;c. to the Church, that is, being the most noble and chiefe members whereby the body is go|verned. Thirdly, the Senat of Elders is said to represent the Church, because of the affinity and likenesse betwixt it and the Se|nate, which representeth a City, or some inferior civil Corporation, affinity, I mean, not every way, but in this, that the govern|ment is not in the hands of all, but a few, and that those few were chosen with the consent of the whole Corporation. Fourth|ly, and if for these reasons the Eldership of a particular Church may be called a re|presentative Church, there is much more reason for giving this name to a classicall Presbytery, or to a Synod provinciall, or nationall, for these doe result out of many particular Churches being made up of their Commissioners.</P>
<P>His second reason he taketh from the nature of representations, alleaging that if the Elders in their Consistory represent the Church, then whatsoever they either
<PB N="17" REF="126">
decree or do agreeing to the Word of God, that also the Church decreeth and doth, though absent, though ignorant, both what the thing is, and upon what grounds it is done by the Elders: and this how consonant it is to Papists implicit faith, he leaveth it to wise men to consi|der. This argument is as much against the representations of Kings and States by their Ambassadours and Commissioners, it is against the representation of Churches by the Consistory of Elders, and so all the wisdome of Princes and States in their Embassages shall turne to implicit faith, because according to this ground, what the representing doth within the bounds of his Commission, that the represented doth <HI>implicit&egrave;.</HI> And now I shall leave to be con|sidered by wise men these vast differen|ces betwixt the Papists implicit faith, and the case of our Churches governed by El|derships. 1. The Church assenteth not to that which the Consistory of Elders de|creeth or doth, except it be agreeing to the Word of God, as the Reasoner him|selfe saith: but there is no such limitation in the Papists implicit faith. 2. The Con|sistory of Elders doth not presse any thing upon the Church, imperiously, or by na|ked wil and authority without any reason,
<PB N="12" REF="127">
as the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> doth with those from whom she requireth implicit faith. 3. The Papists know not what those things be which they beleeve by implicit faith: so that such a faith is rightly called <HI>mera ar|ticulorum fidei ignorantia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ger. loc. theol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om.</HI> 3. <HI>de Iusti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; 114.</NOTE> a meere igno|rance of the articles of faith: but the de|crees of our Elderships whereunto our Churches do consent, are made knowne unto them. 4. Our Churches are by the judgement of Christian discretion to ex|amine all things propounded unto them, even the decrees of the Elders, whereas Papists may not examine what the Church propoundeth or commandeth. 5. Papists by their implicit faith beleeve whatsoever the Church beleeveth, because they think the Church can not erre, but our Churches conceive not only their particular Elder|ships, but oecumenicall councels to be sub|ject to error.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 11.</NOTE>Come we now to his third generall rea|son: whereby he laboureth to prove that the consistorian course is contrary to the practise of the Apostolick Churches, be|cause the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. writeth to the whole Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> to excommuni|cate the incestuous man. And that by these words (<HI>when you are c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me together</HI>) the whole Church is to be understood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 12.</NOTE> he pro|veth
<PB N="9" REF="127">
by three reasons: the strength of them all, we shall take together in one ar|gument thus. <HI>They among whom the forni|catour was,</HI> who <HI>were puffed up when they should have sorrowed,</HI> and <HI>out of the midst of whom he was to be put, who had done that thing,</HI> to whom it appertained to <HI>purge out the old leven,</HI> and to whom the Apostle wrote <HI>not to be commingled with fornicators</HI> or <HI>co|vetous persons,</HI> they were to be <HI>gathered to|gether into one,</HI> and to <HI>judge</HI> and excommu|nicate that incestuous person.</P>
<P>But they among whom the fornicator was, &amp;c. were not the Elders alone, but the whole Church, <HI>Ergo,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now what shall this disputer say, if I cleave this his strong argument with a wedge of his own timber, thus, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If they among whom the fornicator was, who were puffed up, when they should have sorrowed, and out of the midst of whom, &amp;c. were to judge and excommunicate that incestuous person, then women were to judge and excom|municate him, and not men only. But the latter is absurd, therefore so is the former. My proposition he must either grant, or else say that the incestuous man was not to be put out of the midst of women, and that the Apostle did not forbid women to be commingled with fornicators. My assump|tion
<PB N="20" REF="128">
is his own, Pag. 24. where he tels us from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.34, 35. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.12. that wo|men are debarred from liberty or right of voting in publick ecclesiasticall matters.

<P>To conclude this case, the Apostle as in other Epistles, so in this, doth sometime point at common duties belonging to the whole Church, sometime at the du|ties of officers. That the whole Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> should have sorrowed for the incestuous man, and that it was a common duty to them, not to be commingled with fornicators,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. 5.11.</NOTE> and to <HI>have no fellowship with the unfruitfull workes of darknesse, but rather to reprove them</HI>: In like manner it con|cerned them all to comfort him being pe|nitent. But as for the judging, and excom|municating of him, that did belong only to the Presbytery of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and so <HI>Calvin, Piscator, Paraeus,</HI> and many others expound the Apostles words.</P>
<P>His digression to prove that the Apostle alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 13.14.</NOTE> did not give forth sentence judicia|ry upon the offender, is not against us, but against the prelaticall party, therefore I passe it.</P>

and undoubtedly take knowledge of the contumacy of the person, that is to bee ex|communicated, &amp; of the crime for which, and this we also say with him.</P>
<P>One word I desire to have cleared be|fore wee proceed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag 20.</NOTE> One of his grounds in his discourse about elections, is that the Church officers, as they are the servants of Christ Jesus, so also her servants for Jesus sake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Synops. dist. 49. Th. 1.</NOTE> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.5. The professors of <HI>Leyden</HI> say well, that they are not properly the servants of the Church, but of God, and of Christ: They are not Lords of the Church neither, but Rulers, Guides, Bishops, and Pastors of the Church: yet not servants of the Church except, <HI>objective,</HI> that is, the servants of God in the Church, or for the Churches good. If this bee his meaning, it is well. But I doubt he hath another mea|ning, and that is, that the Church doth give the power (which is hers) unto her officers, as her servants to exercise it in her name. If this bee the matter, then let us marke with <HI>Baynes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diocess. tryall pag. 88.</NOTE> that the Church doth not virtually and out of power make an officer, but shee doth it in Stewardlike manner, ministring to the sole Lord and master of the house, so that hee who is taken in doth not his office in her name, but in his masters name: as a Butler taken in by the Steward of the house, doth not ex|ecute his office in the stewards name, but
<PB N="24" REF="130">
in his masters, who only out of power did conferre it on him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 22.</NOTE>But now lest any should conceive of him and those of his side, that they either exercise amongst themselves, or would thrust upon others any popular or demo|craticall Church governement: therefore he desireth the Reader to make estimate, both of their judgement and practice in this point, according to these three decla|rations.</P>
<P>First he saith they beleeve, that the ex|ternall Church governement under Christ, is plainely aristocraticall and to be admini|stred by some choyce men, although the state bee after a fort popular and demo|craticall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 23.</NOTE> In respect of the latter, he saith it appertaines to the people freely, to vote in elections &amp; judgements of the Church; in respect of the former, that the Elders ought to governe the people, even in their voting in just liberty, by propounding and ordering all things, and (after the voting of the Church) solemnly executing, either ordination or excommunication. Behold how he runneth upon the rocke of popu|lar governement, even whiles he preten|deth to have his course another way: God send us better pilots. I remember I have read in sundry places of <HI>Bodin de repub.</HI> that the state is oft times different from the go|vernement. But sure I am, this anti-consi|storian
<PB N="25" REF="130">
maketh not only the state, but the governement of the Church to be demo|craticall, &amp; that in the superlative degree, for the governement is democraticall, at least composed of a mixture of aristocracy, and democracy (which is the most that he dare say of the Church governement) where the people have the liberty of ele|cting their owne officers and rulers, and where the Senat so farre observeth the people, that they may not passe the finall act, in any matter of importance, without the knowledge and tacite consent o the people, though the people doe not vote in the Senat, nay though the Senat doe not vote in the hearing of the people. Now this seemeth not enough to those with whom wee have now to doe. They will have the people <HI>freely to vote</HI> in all <HI>judge|ments of the Church.</HI> And what is that, but the very exercise of jurisdiction by the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>de pol. eccle. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 7.</NOTE> which is the democracy of <HI>Movel|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> condemned by <HI>Parker</HI> himselfe, who maketh the exercise of ecclesiasticall po|wer proper to the Rulers of the Church, though he placeth the power it selfe origi|nally in the whole Church. Let it further be observed, what difference these men make betwixt the Elders and the people in the governement of the Church: That which they make proper to the Elders is only the propounding and ordering of matters, and the excuting of some so|lemne
<PB N="26" REF="131">
act in name of the Church. This is no more then belongeth to the moderator or <HI>Praeses</HI> in any consistory, But they will have the matter to bee determined accor|ding to the most voyces of the people. And so the new forme of Church governement which is here laid before us, is a mere de|mocracy with many moderators, which is the most monstrous governement that ever was heard of.</P>
<P>His second declaration is, that the El|ders may and ought at times to meet apart from the body of the Church, for delibe|ration. This if hee meane only of that which hee specifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, the preparing of things so as publik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, and before the peo|ple, they may bee prosecuted with most conveniency. It is no more then what many require in moderators of Synods, to whom they think fit, that some Assessors, or Coadjutors be adjoyned for delibera|ting in private, upon the most orderly and convenient prosecuting of purposes in publike: which as it hindereth not the governement of Synods to be aristocrati|call; so neither doth the deliberation of the Elders in private, hinder the governe|ment now in question to be democraticall. But if he meane generally, that the Elders may deliberate apart upon everything whatsoever, which is to be voyced by the people, then I aske by what reason doth
<PB N="27" REF="131">
he seclude from the deliberations those who are to voice? for to give being and force to an Ecclesiasticall decree by voy|cing, is more than to deliberate upon it, whence it is that Papists give to Presbyters a deliberative voice in Councels, but not a decisive voice, and we also permit any un|derstanding godly man to propound a matter to a Synod, or to reason upon it, though none have power of suffrage but the Commissioners of Churches; So that he had greater reason to seclude the peo|ple from the voyces, than from the delibe|rations.</P>
<P>His third declaration comes last,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 24.</NOTE> and that is that by the people whose right in voting they thus stand for, they understand not women and children, but only men, and them growen, and of discretion. Be|fore hee did object to us that neither in Scripture nor in Greeke Authors, the name <HI>Church</HI> is used for the assembly of sole Go|vernours: and to this I suppose I did give a satisfactory answer. But good Sir be plea|sed mutually to resolve us where you have read in Scripture, or in Greek Authors the name Church (setting aside all representa|tives of Churches and Assemblies of sole Governors) used for men alone, and them growen and of discretion, secluding wo|men and children: for now I see your re|served Glosse upon those words <HI>Tell the
<PB N="28" REF="132">
Church: Tell all the men in the Parish that are growne and of discretion,</HI> you must not take so much upon you, as to expound that Text by a Synecdoche, which none that ever wrote upon it before your selves did imagine, and yet challenge us for expoun|ding it by another Synecdoche, following <HI>Chrysostome, Euthymius, Faber Stapulensis,</HI> and many late Interpreters, who under|stand by Church in that place, the Rulers of the Church, which are the noblest part of the Church. I shall shut up this point with the words of <HI>Hyperius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Comment. in 1 Cor. 5.4.</NOTE> who saith that we must not understand by the Church the whole multitude, <HI>Sed potius delectos</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But rather certaine choice Elders, noted for their learning and godlinesse, in whose power the Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch will have to bee the judgement in such like causes, which is proved from that, that</HI> Matth. 18 <HI>after it was said, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell the Church, it is added; where two or three are gathered to|gether in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</HI> And 2 Cor. 2. he saith, <HI>Sufficient is this censure inflicted by many.</HI></P>
<P>We have now done with the Elderships of particular Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 24, 14.</NOTE> but there is ano|ther blow which I perceive is intended a|gainst classicall Presbyteries and Synods provincial and national, for the due power by which my opposite would have the Church to be governed, hee layeth before us in this Assertion, that <HI>every particular vi|sible
<PB N="29" REF="132">
Church hath from Christ absolute and intire power to exercise in and of her selfe, every or|dinance of God, and so is an independent body, not standing under any other Ecclesiasticall au|thority out of it selfe.</HI> And this he will prove by ten Arguments: but I shall not need to multiply answers, as hee doth arguments, because many of them are coincident. The first, third, fourth, and sixth, doe all hit up|on the same string.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 26.</NOTE> The first is thus: If those Churches, planted by the Apostolique in|stitution, had power fully in themselves immediatly from Christ to practise all his ordinances: Then have all Churches the like power now.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 28.</NOTE> But the first is true. <HI>Ergo.</HI> The third thus; Whatsoever was com|manded by the seven Churches to be pra|ctised by each of them, apart, in and for themselves, that no Church of God must now omit. But Ecclesiasticall government was commanded to the seven Churches to bee practised by each of them, &amp;c. The fourth thus;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 28, 29.</NOTE> If the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> had power and authority within her selfe to exercise Ecclesiasticall Government; then ought not particular Congregations now to stand under any other Ecclesiastical au|thority out of themselves. But the first is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Ergo.</HI> The sixth thus. If the Apostle gave commandement unto the Eldership of <HI>Ephesus</HI> for the whole administration of all ordinances in that Church: then may
<PB N="30" REF="133">
the Eldership of every particular congre|gation, administer among themselves all Gods ordinances. But the first is true, <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P>Now for answer to these: First, I simply deny the connexion of the proposition of the fourth argument, because it argueth <HI>&agrave; genere ad speciem affirmative,</HI> from the exer|cising of ecclesiastical Government, to the exercising of it independently. Neither hath hee said any thing for proofe hereof. Next, the Reader will easily perceive, that both in the first and sixth Argument his ci|tations in proofe both of the propositions and assumptions, have not so much as the least colour of pertinency, and farre lesse of proofe. In both these arguments, when he would prove the proposition, he spea|keth to the assumptio~, &amp; contrariwise. But these things I delight not to insist upon: only I shall give two Distinctions, any one of which, much more both of them shall make these arguments wholly improfita|ble unto him&punc; First, I distinguish his pro|positions. That power &amp; authority which the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> the seven Chur|ches of <HI>Asia,</HI> and other Apostolicall Chur|ches had to exercise Ecclesiastical govern|ment in and for themselves, the like have all Churches now which are of the like frame and condition: but the most part of particular Churches now are of a different frame and condition from the Apostolique
<PB N="31" REF="133">
Churches, and so have not such fulnesse of power as they had. Put the case that the Apostolick Churches were no greater then might and did or|dinarily assemble together into one place for the worship of God, yet since by reason of the trou|ble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of those times (which suffered not the Chri|stians to spread themselves abroad all the coun|trey over, but confined them within Cities and safe places) those Churches were not planted so thick and neare together, as that they might have the conveniency of Synodical consociation: hence it appeareth that they might do many things in and by themselves, which particular Congregati|ons now having the conveniency of consociation with neighbour Churches, ought not to do in and by themselves. But this I have said <HI>gratis,</HI> having in my former Treatise at length declared that the Apostolick Churches (at least the most and prin|cipall of them) were greater then could assemble ordinarily in one place of worship, and that they were served with sundry both Pastors and Elders, &amp; that therefore our Parochiall Churches ought not to be (in respect of the points in question) compared with their Churches, nor our Parochiall Presbyteries with their Presbyteries.</P>
<P>The second distinction which I have to pro|pound is concerning the assumptions of the argu|ments now in hand. The Apostolick Churches did indeed ordinarily exercise Ecclesiasticall go|vernment and all the ordinances of Christ, in and for themselves, yet so that when the occasion of a Synode did occurre for determining a question
<PB N="32" REF="134">
which was too hard for particular Churches, and was also common to many Churches, in that case they did submit themselves to the authority of he Synod. Which hath also before beene made plaine from <HI>Act.</HI> 15. To practise all the ordinan|ces of God in a Church is one thing, and to pra|ctise them independantly so as nev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r to be subject to the authority of a Synod, is another thing. My antagonist doth after take it for granted &amp; saith, that <HI>all learned men have granted</HI> that the Church|es of the Apostolick constitution were indepen|dant bodies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 32.</NOTE> But whence are you Sir that would make your Reader beleeve there are no learned men in the Churches of <HI>Scotland, France,</HI> the low-countries, and the other reformed Churches which have the governement of Presbyteries and Synods, conceiving it to be most agreeable to the Apostolicall patterne? Have you put out of the category of learned men all Protestant writers who in the controversies about Councels dispute against Papists from <HI>Acts</HI> 15.2. Why did you not among all your imeprtinent allegations, cite some few of those learned men who grant the Aposto|lick Churches to have been independant bodies? But we must heare what more you have to say.</P>
<P>Your first eight and tenne arguments are in like manner coincident.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 29.</NOTE> The first you frame thus. Such actions the Church may lawfully do where|in no law of God is broken. But there is no law of God broken, when particular Churches do in and among themselves exercise all Gods ordinan|ces. <HI>Ergo.</HI> The eight thus. Whatsoever governe|ment
<PB N="33" REF="134">
cannot be found commanded in the written Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God, ought not to have any place in the Church of God. But the Government of Presby|teries and Synods over many particular congre|gations cannot be found commanded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 34.</NOTE> &amp;c. The tenth thus. It is a sinne against God to adde any thing to that forme and manner of ordering Churches which Christ hath set forth in the new Testament. But to subject particular congregati|ons under any other Ecclesiasticall authority out of themselves, is to adde, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now the word <HI>independantly</HI> must be added to the assumption of the first argument, else it can|not conclude what he affirmes and we deny: for there is no question but particular Churches may exercise in and among them selves all Gods ordi|nances in those cases and with those distinctions which I have spoken of before, <HI>part</HI> 2. <HI>chap.</HI> 2. This being cleared I deny the assumption in all these three arguments. I expected proofe for it, but he hath given none, except that it cannot for shame be denied. I had thought it rather a shamefull thing for a writer to trouble his Reader with ar|guments which he cannot make good.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Synops. dyp. 49: Th. 10. ex. dyp. 42. Thes. 62.</NOTE> But what saith he to the professors of <HI>Leyden</HI> who hold the institution of Synods not to be humane, but di|vine, w^c^h they prove from <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. &amp; <HI>Act.</HI> 15. Nay what is more ordinary in Protestant writers then the applying of those words, <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,</HI> unto Synods and Councels; and hence they condemne the popish Councels, in so much that <HI>Bellarmin, Salmeron,</HI> and other Jesuits have in this contradicted all our writers, telling us (as
<PB N="34" REF="135">
these men doe) that our Saviour meaneth not of Councels in these words. Moreover that com|mandement whereby we stand obliged to fol|low the example both of the Jewish Church in the Old Testament, and of the Apostolicall Churches in the New Testament, in such things as they had not for any speciall reason which doth not concerne us, is transgressed by the withdraw|ing of Congregations from subjection unto Sy|nods. Of which things I have said enough be|fore. It is now but a poore begging of that which is in question, to object that the governement of Presbyteries and Synods hath no warrant from the Word of God.</P>
<P>Come we then to examine his other Arguments. His second he composeth thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 27.</NOTE> If Christ in <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.17. where he saith, <HI>Tell the Church,</HI> doth mean a particular Congregation: then hath every par|ticular Congregation an intire power in and of it selfe to exercise Eclesiasticall governement, and all other Gods spirituall ordinances. But the first is true. <HI>Ergo,</HI> for the proposition he citeth some Writers who do not speak of such a connexion as he had to prove. The assumption he proveth thus. That Church which Christ intendeth in <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. hath absolute power in and of it selfe to perform all Gods ordinances. But Christ intendeth in <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. a particular Congregation. Therefore every particular Congregation hath absolute power, &amp;c. How bravely doth he conclude the point? <HI>Specta|tum admissi risum teneatis amici</HI>&punc; We will not exa|mine our examinators logick: we know what he would say: and we woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have him to know a|gaine that Christ in <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. meaneth indeed some
<PB N="35" REF="135">
sort of a particular Congregation, but neither on|ly nor independantly. Nay he meaneth all the Consistories of the Church higher and lower re|spectively, as <HI>Parker</HI> conceiveth, whose words I have before set down: and to this sense the threed of the text doth leade us, for as in the preceding words there is a gradation from one to two or three more, then to the Church, so is there a gra|dation (by the like order and reason) in the Con|sistories of the Church. <HI>Tostatus</HI> upon this place ac|knowledgeth that <HI>Diae Ecclesiae</HI> reacheth as far as to an oecumenicall Councell, when particular Churches erre in their determinations, or when the cause is common to all the Churches, for ex|ample, when the Pope is to be condemned.</P>
<P>His seventh argument followes in my order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 31.</NOTE> and it runneth after this manner. Such offices and callings without which the Church of God is co~|pleat and perfect for government, are superfluous and humane. But the Church of God may be com|pleat &amp; perfect for government, without Presby|teriall and Synodicall offices and callings. <HI>Ergo.</HI> I answer by a distinction. Such offices and callings without which the Church of God are according to the course of Gods ordinary providence, or at all times and in all cases, perfect and compleat for government, are indeed superfluous and humane. But that such offices and callings without which the Church by the absolute power of God or at some times &amp; in some cases is perfect &amp; compleat, are superfluous &amp; humane, we utterly deny. Now for the point of Synods I shall produce no other witnesses then those which this Disputer here ta|keth to be for him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Conc. q</HI> 1. <HI>p</HI> 29.</NOTE> <HI>Whittaker</HI> acknowledgeth of
<PB N="36" REF="136">
Councels that <HI>Secundum ordinariam providentiam necessaria sunt ad bonam ecclesiae gubernationem:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Pol. Eccle. lib. 3. pag. 131.</NOTE> <HI>ac|cording to ordinary providence they are necessary for the well governing of the Church. Parker</HI> acknow|ledgeth Synods to be sometime necessary in the Church, and he giveth example of the Councell of <HI>Nice,</HI> without which the evils of the Church in the daies of <HI>Constantine</HI> could not have bin remedied.</P>
<P>The ninth Argument remaineth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 33.</NOTE> which is this. That government which meerly tendeth unto the taking away from particular Congregations, their due power is unlawfull. But the government of Presbyteries and Synods (as they now are) doth meerly tend unto the taking away from particu|lar Congregations their due power. <HI>Ergo.</HI> I did ex|pect some strong proofe for the assumption of this argument, but we must take it as it is. He tels us out of <HI>Master Barlow</HI>&punc; that no man under the degree of a Prophet or an Apostle may prescribe Gods Church and children patternes. Our Synods are further from prescribing patterns either of worship or Church government than himselfe is. The patterne and whole manner of Church government is set down in the Scripture, those circumsta~ces excepted which are common to the Church with the Common-wealth, and are therefore determinable by natures light. Synods may not prescribe new patterns, no more may par|ticular Churches: but Synods may in common causes, and extraordinarily prescribe unto parti|cular churches, such things as particular churches may in particular causes and ordinarily prescribe to their owne members. If he will beleeve <HI>Parker</HI> (whom he thinks his owne) the authority which
<PB N="37" REF="136">
particular Churches have severally is not lost,<NOTE PLACE="marg">de pol. eccl. lib. 3. c 13. p. 124.</NOTE> but augmented when they are joyned together in Sy|nods. But we have before abundantly declared how Presbyteriall &amp; Synodical government doth not at all prejudge the rights of congregations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Supra, cap. ult.</NOTE> As for that which here he addeth by way of supposi|tion, putting the case that Presbyteries &amp; Synods will not permit a congregation to reject some co~|victed hereticks, nor to chuse any, except unfit Ministers, this is just as if one should object a|gainst Parliaments, that (as they are now) they do meerly tend to the taking away of the right and liberty of the subject, and then for proofe should put the case, that Parliaments will protect and maintaine Monopolists, Projectorers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now in this drove of arguments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 35.</NOTE> the drover hath set some like the weake of the flock to follow up behind. The first two are blind, and see not where they are going: for it maketh nothing against us, either that the Eldership of one congregation, hath not authority over the Eldership of another congregation, or that a minister should not un|dertake the care of more Churches then one.</P>
<P>His third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. p. 124.</NOTE> that presbyteriall power is never menti|oned in the Scripture, is a begging of the thing in question, &amp; is answered before; yet I must put him again in mind of <HI>Parker,</HI> who speaking of churches saith: <HI>Legitur in Scripturis de conjunct a earu~ auct ori|tate, quando in Synodis congregantur. We read in their Scriptures of their joynt authority, when they are ga|thered together into Synods.</HI> But there is a speech of <HI>Zuinglius</HI> against representative Churches, which he may not omit. <HI>Zuing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ius</HI> doth indeed justly aske of the antichristian prelats, who had given them
<PB N="38" REF="137">
the name of a representative Church, &amp; who had given them power to make Canons &amp;c. yet hee addeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 8. expla.</NOTE> <HI>de his duntaxat &amp;c. I speak of them only that are such, others who put themselves under not above the Scriptures, my writings shall nothing prejudge.</HI></P>
<P>In the fourth place he objecteth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 36.</NOTE> that whosoever shall deny their assertion, must hold two distinct formes of Church government to be lawfull, one where particular congregations do in &amp; of them|selves exercise all Gods ordinances;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. cap. 2.</NOTE> the other where they stand under another ecclesiasticall au|thority out of themselves. I answer it is most law|full for particular congregations in and of them|selves to exercise all Gods ordinances, according to the distinctions &amp; rules above mentioned: but this is not repugnant to their standing, under the authority of presbyteries &amp; Synods, for which let us againe heare a tender friend of congregations. <HI>Major quidem potestas est Synodi quam unius alicujus Ecclesiae primea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parker ubi su|pra.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; parochialis</HI>; But goe we along.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 129.</NOTE>His first argument is, that for this reason, among others the learned say the Pope is Antichrist, <HI>viz.</HI> because he will have men to appeale from their owne Churches unto him, and to stand unto his sentence and decree: and doe not the pres|byteriall assemblies &amp; Synods, take upon them an authority much like to it. Soft my master, Soft. Canno lesse serve you, then to match our Church governeme~t with the papall usurpations. 2. I shall beseech you to remember, 1. The Pope is one and receiveth appellations monarchinally: a Synod consisteth of many, &amp; receiveth appellations ari|stocratically: 2. The Pope receiveth appellations from other nations beyond Sea: presbiteries and
<PB N="39" REF="137">
Synods not so. 3. The Pope will have his sente~ce re|ceived as infallible: presbyteries &amp; synods acknow|ledge themselves subject to error. 4. The Pope ac|knowledgeth neither the Elders, nor the Elderships of congregations: which Presbyteries &amp; Synods do. 5. The Pope acknowledeth no power ecclesiasti|call on earth, except what is subject to him, yea de|rived from him: and who will say so of Presbyteries &amp; Synods. 6. The Pope receiveth appellations in other causes then ecclesiasticall: Presbyteries and Synods not so. 7. Synods are made up of the Com|missioners of Churches: The Pope neither hath any co~mission himselfe from the Churches, nor will ad|mit the Commissioners of Churches, to sit in judge|ment with him. 8. Synods when they receive appel|lations, are tyed to certaine rules of proceeding and judging, especially the Scripture. The Pope maketh his power boundlesse, and exalteth himselfe, above the very Scripture. There shall be no end&punc; except I stop in time. And what need I to make so many differences betwixt light and darknesse.</P>
<P>A sixth argument we shall now have, what more meet and reasonable saith he, then that every mans case be there heard &amp; determined, where the fault was co~mitted. If this rule hold the~ the Parliame~t or privy Councell, ought to go to every remote coun|ty &amp; corner of the kingdome, to judge of such faults there co~mitted, as are proper for the~ to judg. His 7.8.10.11. arguments must be gone with silence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 37.38</NOTE> for they run upon the robbing of congregations of their right, the exercising of ecclesiasticall govern|ment, in all the apostolique Churches, &amp; our accor|ing with Papists &amp; the Hierarchy. All which obje|ctions have been before repelled; &amp; it is somewhat
<PB N="40" REF="138">
strange, that the disput<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r doth so often repeate the same arguments, to make up the greater number. A pretty art indeed: like that of the young logician who would needs prove, that the foure egs upon the table were five, because two &amp; three make five.</P>
<P>In this second clause of arguments there is only one behind, and that is, that by the titles given to all particular co~gregations, <HI>viz. a kingdome, a family, a body, a Queen &amp;c.</HI> it appeareth that all ecclesiasticall auctority, ought to be in every one of the~ distinct|ly, wholly, entirely. Where let the reader observe, that he maketh the meaning of that place <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.2. <HI>the kingdome of God is at hand,</HI> to be this, <HI>a particular congregation is at hand</HI>; also that he expoundeth <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.19. &amp; <HI>Ps.</HI> 45. of a particular congregation, which are meant of the holy Catholike Church. But say that every particular congregation is a kingdome, a family, a body, a Queene, how proveth he that these names doe agree to every congregation in re|spect of her externall policy, or ecclesiasticall go|vernment. Nay say they, doe agree in this respect, yet in a thousand examples it is to be seen, that one and the same thing is both <HI>totum</HI> &amp; <HI>pars,</HI> the whole, &amp; the part, in different respects. Whereof we have also spoken in the former treatise.</P>
<P>He concludeth, that by this time he doth suppose the reader perceiveth, that the Scriptures are every way for them, and against the Presbyteriall govern|ement, you shall doe well Sir to thinke better upon it; you have it yet to prove: Therefore goe to your second thoughts, and examine with me your not unexaminable examination. Farewell.</P>
