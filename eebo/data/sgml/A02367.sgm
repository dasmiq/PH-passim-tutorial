<P>_WHere there is diuersitie of helpes, leading to
one Intention of good, the variety may well be
tolerated. Who findes fault with a Garden,
for the multitude of flowers? You shall per|ceiue
heere different kinds; whereof (if some
to some seeme bitter) there is none vnwhole|some.
It takes fire at the Altar of God, and beginnes with the
Christians <HI>Sacrifice:</HI> the flame wherof (by the operation of the
blessed <HI>Spirit</HI>) may both enlighten the vnderstanding, and
warme the affections of good men: and in others consumingly
waste the drosse and rust of sinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3. 11. 12.</NOTE> which must eyther be <HI>pur|ged</HI>
by the <HI>fire</HI> of Grace heere; or sent to the euerlasting <HI>fire</HI>
to be <HI>burned.</HI> The <HI>Wisemens Oblation</HI> seconds it: what
is formerly commaunded in Precept, is heere commended in
Practise. The <HI>Politicke Hunters</HI> of the world are discoue|red:
and <HI>Plaine-Dealing</HI> encouraged. One (almost forgotten
vertue) <HI>Charitie</HI> is praised; and a busie vice is taxed. In all
is intended <HI>Lux Scientiae, Pax Conscientiae; Peccati ru|ina,
aedificatio Iustitiae.</HI></P>
<P>Your noble endeuours are obserued by all eyes, to bee distin|guished
<PB REF="3">
into this method: from your vertues there is a resultance
of shining Light to information, from your Office to reformation
of others. Goe forward so still, to menage your Place in that ho|nourable
Citie: and let the fire of correction eate out the rust
of corruption. You may punish, euen whiles you pitie. The good
Magistrate, like a good Chirurgion, doth with a shaking hand
search vlcers; more earnestly desiring <HI>Non inuenire quod

<HEAD>The LORD.</HEAD>
<P>WEe haue heard his <HI>Goodnesse;</HI> listen to his <HI>Greatnesse.</HI>
In this Title we will consider his <HI>Maiestie,</HI> as wee
did in the other his <HI>Mercie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord</HI> implies a great State <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Title is giuen to a
great man vpon earth. But if an earthen Lord be great;
<HI>Quantus est Dominus, qui Dominos facit?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug.</NOTE> How great is the
<HI>Lord</HI> which makes Lords? yea, and vnmakes them two
at his pleasure.</P>
<P>This is an absolute and independant <HI>Lord.</HI> 1. Cor. 8.
<HI>There may be many Gods, and many Lords.</HI> But this is <HI>Ille

controlls them all. They are <HI>Domini titulares;</HI> this is
<HI>Dominus tutelaris.</HI> They are in title and name, this in
deed and power.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Many,</HI> saith S^t. <HI>Paul.</HI> Many in Title many
in Opinion. Some are <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Gods ex authoritate;</HI> so
are Kings and Magistrates.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 82. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>God standeth in the congrega|tion

<P>The <HI>Lord</HI> is onely Almighty; able to doe more by

for potent, not impotent workes. He cannot lie, he can|not
die.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de Ciuit Dei. Lib. 5. Cap. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Diciter omnipotens faciendo quod vult, non patiendo
quod non vult.</HI> He is called Almightie in doing what he
pleaseth not in suffering what he pleaseth not.</P>
<P>This is his <HI>Greatnesse.</HI> As his Mercie directs vs to loue
him, so let his Maiestie instruct vs to feare him. I will
briefly touch both these affections; but <HI>Loue</HI> shall goe
formost.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>OVr God is <HI>Good,</HI> and good to vs; let vs therefore
<HI>loue</HI> him. 1. It is an Affection, that God principally
requires. 2. It is a Nature, wherein alone we can an|swere
God.</P>
<P>For the former, God requires not thy Wisedome to
direct him, nor thy Strength to assist him, nor thy
Wealth to enrich him, nor thy Dignitie to aduance him;
but onely thy <HI>Loue. Loue him with all thy heart.</HI></P>
<P>For the second; Man cannot indeed answere God
well in any other thing. When God iudgeth vs, wee
must not iudge him againe: When hee reprooues vs,
wee must not iustifie our selues. If he be angry, wee
must answere him in patience; if hee commaunde, in
obedience: But when God <HI>loues</HI> vs, wee must answere
him in the same nature, though not in the same measure;
and <HI>loue</HI> him againe. Wee may not giue God word for
word: wee dare not offer him blow for blow: wee can
not requite him good turne for good turne: yet wee
may, can, must giue him <HI>Loue</HI> for <HI>Loue. Nam cum amat
Deus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bern. Serm. 83. in Cant.</NOTE> <HI>non aliud vult qu&agrave;m amari,</HI></P>
<P>Now because euery man sets his foote vpon the free|hold
of <HI>Loue,</HI> and sayes, it is mine; let vs aske for his
Euidence whereby he holdes it? We call an Euidence,
a Deed; and <HI>Deedes</HI> are the best demonstration of our
right in <HI>Loue.</HI> If thou <HI>loue</HI> God for his owne sake, shew
it by thy deedes of Pietie: If thou loue Man for Gods
<PB N="5" REF="5">
sake, shew it by thy deedes of Charitie. The roote of
<HI>Loue</HI> is in the Heart; but it sendes foorth Veines into
the Hands, and giues them an actiue and nimble dexte|ritie
to good Workes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 14. 15.</NOTE> <HI>If you loue mee,</HI> sayth Christ, <HI>keepe
my Commandements.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 3. 17.</NOTE> If you <HI>loue</HI> man, shew your <HI>Com|passion</HI>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FEARE.</HEAD>
<P>LEt vs p&agrave;sse from <HI>Loue</HI> to <HI>Feare.</HI> we must <HI>Loue</HI> our <HI>good
God:</HI> we must <HI>Feare</HI> our <HI>great Lord.</HI> It is obiected a|gainst
this passage of vnion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 4. 18.</NOTE> that <HI>perfect loue casteth out
feare.</HI> It is answered, that <HI>feare</HI> brings in <HI>perfect loue;</HI> as
the Needle drawes in the Thread. And it is not possible,
that true <HI>Loue</HI> should be without good <HI>Feare;</HI> that is, a
filiall Reuerence. For slauish feare, be it as farre from
your hearts, as it shall be from my discourse.</P>
<P>Now this <HI>Feare</HI> is a most due and proper affection:
and (I may say) the fittest of all to be towards God. In|deed
God requires our <HI>Loue:</HI> but we must thinke, that
then God stoupes low, and bowes himselfe downe to
be loued of vs. For there is such an infinite inequalitie
betwixt God and vs, that without his sweet dignation,
and descending to vs, there could be no fitnesse of
this affection. But looke we vp to that infinite glory
of our <HI>great Lord:</HI> looke we downe on the vilenesse of
our selues, sinfull dust: and we will say, that by reason
of the disproportion betweene vs, nothing is so sutable
for our basenesse to giue so high a God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 34. 11.</NOTE> as <HI>Feare.</HI> There|fore,
<HI>Comeye Children hearken vnto me: I will teach you the
feare of the Lord.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 31. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Feare</HI> the Lord all ye his <HI>Seruants;</HI> as
well as <HI>Loue the Lord all ye his Saints.</HI></P>
<P>Now this <HI>Feare</HI> hath as many Chalengers as <HI>Loue</HI>
had. When this Booke is held out, euery mans lippes are
<PB N="6" REF="6">
readie to kisse it; and to say and sweare, that they <HI>feare</HI>
the Lord.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 2. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Loue</HI> had the Testimonie, <HI>Charytie:</HI> and <HI>Feare,</HI>
must haue his <HI>Seruice.</HI> Psal. 2. <HI>Serue the Lord with feare.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is mans necessitated condition to be a Seruant.
Happy they,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 13. 13.</NOTE> that can truly call Christ Maister: <HI>Yee call
mee Lord and Maister, and ye say well; for so I am.</HI></P>
<P>Hee that serues the <HI>Flesh,</HI> serues his fellow: And a Beg|gar
mounted on the backe of Honour, rides post to the
Diuell. This is a cholericke Maister; so fickle, that at
euery turne, he is ready to turne thee out of dores. Wee
may say of him, as of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> Hee is a bad Seruant,
but a worse Maister.</P>
<P>Hee that serues the <HI>World,</HI> serues his Seruant; as if
<HI>Chams</HI> curse was lighted on him, <HI>Seruus seruorum;</HI> a
Drudge to Slaues, a Slaue to Drudges.</P>
<P>He that serues the <HI>Diuell,</HI> serues his Enemie; and this
is a miserable seruice. Sure it was a lamentable pre|posterous
sight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 7.</NOTE> that <HI>Salomon</HI> saw. Eccle. 10. <HI>I haue seene

when he raigneth, and a Foole when he is filled with Meate: an
odious woman, when she is marryed, and a handmaid that is
heire to her Mistres.</HI></P>
<P>Iudge then how horryble it is, that men should set
(as the Sauages of <HI>Calecut</HI>) the Diuell, or his two In|gles,
the world and the flesh in the Throne; whiles
they place God in the foote-stoole. Or that in this
Common-wealth of man, Reason which is the Queene,
or the Princes the better powers &amp; graces of the Soule,
should stoupe to so base a Slaue, as sensuall lust. <HI>De|light
is not seemely for a foole:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro&punc; 19. 10.</NOTE> <HI>much lesse for a Seruant to haue
rule ouer Princes.</HI></P>
<P>S^t. <HI>Basil</HI> (not without passion) did enuie the Diuells
happynesse: Who had neither Created vs, nor redee|med
vs, nor preserueth vs; but violently Labours our
destruction; that yet he should haue more seruants,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
then God, that made vs, then Iesus Christ that with his
owne precious Blood, and grieuous sufferings bought
vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 116 16.</NOTE> Well, hee is happy, that can truly say with <HI>Dauid;
I am thy Seruant, O Lord, I am thy Seruant, and the Sonne of
thy Handmayde.</HI> This Seruice is true Honour: for so
Kings and Princes; yea the blessed Angels of heauen
are thy fellowes.</P>
<P>God is <HI>Good,</HI> that we may <HI>loue</HI> him: the Lord is <HI>Great</HI>
that wee may <HI>Feare</HI> him. Wee haue heard, both seueral|ly;
let vs consider them ioyntly, and therein the secu|ritie
of our owne happinesse. It is a blessed confirma|tion,
when both these, the <HI>Goodnesse</HI> and the <HI>Greatnesse</HI> of
GOD meete vpon vs. His <HI>Greatnesse,</HI> that hee is able&punc;
his <HI>Goodnesse,</HI> that he is willing to saue vs. Were hee neuer
so Great, if not Good to vs, wee had litle helpe. Were
hee neuer so Good, if not Great, and of abilitie to
succour vs, wee had lesse comfort. Hee would stand
vs in small stead, if either his Will or his Power was
defectiue; if either hee could not, or would not saue
vs.</P>
<P>His Goodnesse without his Greatnesse, might fayle
vs: His Greatnesse without his Goodnesse, would ter|rifie
vs. It is a happy concurrence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 85. 10.</NOTE> when <HI>Mercie and
Truth meet togeather:</HI> when <HI>Righteousnesse and Peace kisse
each other.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 116 5.</NOTE> So sweetly singes the Psalmist: <HI>Graciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

He is once sayd to be <HI>Righteous;</HI> but twice in one verse,
to be <HI>Gratious:</HI> It is sweete when both are conioyned,
as in the first and last verse of this Psalme: <HI>O giue thaenkes
to the Lord, for hee is good: for his Mercie endureth for euer.</HI>
The Lord is <HI>Good;</HI> though <HI>Great,</HI> yet also <HI>Good:</HI> and his
<HI>Mercie</HI> (so well as his <HI>Iustice) endures for euer.</HI> Man hath
no such assurance of comfort in God, as to meditate,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
that his great Power, and good Will; his Glory and
Grace, his Maiestie and Mercie met togeather.</P>
<P>These be Gods two Daughters; Iustice and Mercie:
Let vs honour them both; but let vs kisse and imbrace
Mercie. But alas, wee haue dealt vnkindly with them
both. God hath two Daughters, and we haue rauished
them.</P>
<P>There is a Storie of a man, that meeting in a Desart
with two Virgin-sisters; hee did rauish both of them:
Afterwards on his apprehension, the former desired, that
he might iustly die for it. The other did intreat as ear|nestly,
that he might liue, and that she might enioy him
for her Husband.</P>
<P>Man is that rauisher, and those two Virgins are the
Iustice and Mercie of God. Against his Iustice we haue
sinned, and prouoked his indignation to strike vs: yea,
euen his Mercie we haue abused. For her sake we haue
been spared, and a longer day of repentance giuen vs:
yet we haue despised the riches of this Mercie; and pre|suming
on Mercie, haue dared to multiply our trans|gressions.
Iustice pleades to God that we should die;
vrgeth his Law: <HI>Who so euer sinneth, shall die:</HI> And, <HI>Death
is the wages of sinne.</HI> Mercie intreats beseecheth, that wee
may liue; and produceth the Gospell, <HI>Who so euer repents,
shall be pardoned: Who so euer beleeues, shall be saued:</HI> And
for further assurance, brings foorth that blessed Pardon,
sealed in the Wounds and Blood of <HI>Iesus</HI> Christ. God
hearkens to Mercie for his Sonnes sake: though wee
haue rauished and wronged his Mercie; yet for Mercies
sake, we shall be forgiuen. But then we must be marryed
to Mercie; marryed in our Fayth, beleeuing on Christ:
marryed in our good life, being merci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ull vnto men.</P>

<P>4. They are the effects of blindnesse of minde: and
Ignorance is a greeuous inward Darknesse. <HI>Their fool sh
heart was Darkned: and hence</HI> issued those deadly sinnes

eyes so sore, that they cannot looke vp, and behold this

<P>4. Take benefite of this <HI>Light,</HI> whiles it shines. It
may be clouded, as it was in the dayes of Poperie. Ei|ther
this <HI>Light</HI> may be set to thee, or thou be set to it.

shine, powre in your <HI>Oyle.</HI> Grudge not a litle cost, to

<P>This fellow <HI>Bindes,</HI> but he'l neare <HI>Bind the Sacrifice:</HI>
his conscience shall be loose enough. I could say much
to this <HI>Binder,</HI> if there were any hope of him. But I re|member
a true story, that a friend told me of an Vsurer.
There was a Godly Preacher in his Parish, that did
beate downe with all iust conuictions, and honest re|proofes
that sinne. Many Vsurers flocked to his Church,
<PB N="29" REF="17">
because he was a man of note. Among the rest, this Vsu|rer
did bid him often to dinner, and vsed him very kind|ly.
Not long after this Preacher began to forbeare Vsu|rie;
not in any conniuence or partiallitie; but because
he had dealt plentyfully with it; and now his Text led
him not to it.</P>
<P>Now begins the Vsurer to be heauy, sorrowing and
discontent; And turned his former kindnesse into ful|lennesse.
The Preacher must needs obserue it, and bold|ly
asked him the reasons of this sodaine auersion. The
Vsurer replyed. If you had held on your first Course to
in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eigh against Vsurie, I had some hope you would
ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e put all the Vsurers downe; and so I should haue
had the better Vent and Custome for my Mony. For
my part, say what you will, I neuer meant to leaue it:
But I should haue been beholding to you, if you could
haue made me an Vsurer alone. You see the hope of an
Vsurers Conuersion.</P>
<P>But I would to God, that euery one thus bound with
the <HI>Corde</HI> of his Wickednesse, would consider, that so
long as a <HI>Corde</HI> is whole, it is not easily broken: but vn|twist
it, &amp; lay it threed by threed, and you my quickly
snappe it a sunder. Beloued, first vntwine the <HI>Corde</HI> of
your sinnes by serious consideration, and then you
may easily breake them off by Repentance.</P>
<P>4. Some 1. will <HI>Binde,</HI> 2. with <HI>Cords,</HI> 3. yea and the
<HI>Sacrifice,</HI> 4. but not to the <HI>Altar.</HI> There are many of

<P>And for you, that neuer thinke your selues well, but

inclosed, betwixt two great Stones, that hee
could no way es extricate himselfe; made his moane to
a man passing by to deliuer him. The man with much
force remooued the Stone, and set him free. The Serpent
now, feeling his libertie, thus bespake his deliuerer. I
confesse, you haue done mee a kindnesse in helping me
out, being almost famished: But now I am out, my hun|ger
is so violent, that I must needes take the benefite of

but to no purpose, for the Serpent would eate
him. Instantly hee spied an Asse comming, and desi|red
the Serpent to put it to his iudgement. The Serpent
was contented, knowing that the Asse durst not but
condemne the man for his prey, least hee endangered
himselfe. The case was pleaded on both sides; the Man
vrging his kindnesse, the Serpent his hunger: But the
Asse gaue iudgement on the Serpents side; who is now

to whom the Man appealed for Iudgement in this con|trouersie.
The Eagle hearing the cause debated, deman|ded

The Serpent doth so; and the Man re|mooues

<HEAD>His Strength: A Hunter.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Hunting,</HI> in it selfe, is a delight lawfull and lawdable:
and may well be argued for, from the disposition that
God hath put into creatures. Hee hath naturally incli|ned
one kind of Beastes to pursue another, for mans
profite and pleasure. Hee hath giuen the Dogge a secret
instinct to follow the Hare, the Hart, the Foxe, the Bore:
as if hee would direct a man by the finger of Nature to
exercise those qualities, which his diuine Wisedome
created in them.</P>
<P>There is no Creature but may teach a good soule one
step toward his Creator. The World is a Glasse, where|in
we may contemplate the eternall power and maiesty
of God. <HI>For the inuisible things of him, from the creation of the
World,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 20.</NOTE> <HI>are clearely seene, being vnderstood by the thinges that
are made, euen his eternall power and God-head.</HI> It is that
great Booke, of so large a Character, that a man may
runne and read it. Yea, euen the simplest man that can|not
read, may yet spell out of this Booke, that there is a
GOD. Euery Shepheard hath this Calendar, euery
Plough-man this ABC. What that French Poet diuine|ly
sung, is thus as sweetly english'd,
<Q><L>The World's a Schoole; where in a gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rall Story,</L>
<L>God alwayes reades dumbe Lectures of his Glory.</L></Q></P>
<P>But to our purpose: This practise of <HI>Hunting</HI> hath in
it. 1. Recreation. 2. Benefite.</P>
<P>Delight. Though man by his rebellion against his
<PB N="49" REF="28">
Creator, forfeited the Charter which he had in the Crea|tures:
and hereon <HI>Adams</HI> punishment was, that hee
should worke for that <HI>Sudore vultus,</HI> which erst sprung
vp naturally <HI>beneficis Creatoris:</HI> Yet this lapse was reco|uered
in Christ to beleeuers, and a new Patent was sea|led
them in his Blood; that they may vse them not only
<HI>ad necessitatem vitae,</HI> but also in <HI>delectationem animi.</HI> So God
giues man not onely <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> to strengthen his
Heart, but euen <HI>Oyle</HI> to refresh his Countenance. <HI>Let thy
Garments bee alwayes W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ite,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 9. 8.</NOTE> <HI>and let thy Head lacke no Oynt|ment.</HI>
When <HI>Salomon</HI> had found men pulling on them|selues
vnnecessary vexations in this world, and yet not
buying Peace in Heauen with their trouble on Earth;
hee concludes: <HI>Then I commended Mirth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 8. 15.</NOTE> <HI>because a
man hath no better thing vnder the Sunne, then to Eate, and
to Drinke, and to be Merry: for that shall abide with him of
his labour, the day, of his life that God giueth him vnder the
Sunne.</HI></P>
<P>But there is a Liberty, the bounds whereof because
mens affections cannot keepe, it is better their vnder|standings
knew not: For, <HI>Melius est nescire centrum,
quam non tenere circulum.</HI> I may say of too many, as <HI>Se|neca:
Nihilfaelicitati eorum deest, nisi moderatio eius:</HI> They
haue happinesse enough, if they could moderate it.
Nothing is <HI>Magis proprium materiae,</HI> (say Philosophers)
more proper to matter, then to flow; <HI>nisi a forma sistitur,</HI>
vnles the forme refraine and stay it. Nothing is more
peculiar to Man, then to run out, and to erre exorbi|tantly,
if Grace direct not.</P>
<P>Men deale with Recreation, as some Trauellers doe
with anothers Grounds: they begge passage through
them in Winter, for auoydance of the Miry wayes; and
so long vse it on sufferance, that at last they plead Pre|scription,
and hold it by Custome. God allowes De|lights
to succour our infirmitie, and we sawcily turne
them to habituall Practises. Therefore <HI>Salomon</HI> con|demnes
<PB N="50" REF="29">
it in some, as he commendes it in others. <HI>Reioyce
in thy youth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 11. 9.</NOTE> and follow thy vanities: <HI>but know, that for all
this, God will bring thee into Iudgement.</HI> And our Sauiour
denounceth a <HI>Vae ridentibus,</HI> for they that will laugh,
when they should weepe; shall mourne, when they
might haue reioyced.</P>
<P>Wee often read Christ weeping, neuer laughing: ta|king
his creatures for sustentation, not for recreation.
Indeed hee afforded vs this benefite; and what wee had
lost, as it were <HI>ex postliminio,</HI> recouered to vs. But it were
strange, that <HI>Haeres succedens in defuncti locum,</HI> should doe
more, then the Testator euer did himselfe, or allowed
by his graunt: Or that Seruants and Sinners should
challenge that, which was not permitted to their Mai|ster
and Sauiour. But thus wee preuent our libertie,
as the Pharises did the Law, <HI>in sensum reprobum.</HI> These
<HI>Hunt,</HI> but keepe not within Gods Pale; the circum|ferent
limits, wherein hee hath mounded and bounded
our libertie.</P>
<P>Benefite. Recreations haue also their profitable vse,
if rightly vndertaken.</P>
<P>1. The Health is preserued by a moderate Exercise.
<HI>Sedentariam agentes vitam;</HI> They that liue a Sedentarie
life, so find it.</P>
<P>2. The Body is prepared and fitted by these sportiue,
to more serious labours, when the hand of Warre shall
set them to it.</P>
<P>3. The Minde, wearied with grauer employments,
hath thus some coole respiration giuen it, &amp; sent backe
to the seruice of God with a reuiued alacritie.</P>

<HEAD>His Policie. A Cunning Hunter.</HEAD>
<P>But wee haue hunted too long with <HI>Esaus</HI> Strength,
let vs learne his Sleight: <HI>A cunning Hunter.</HI> Hunting
requires <HI>tantum artis, quantum martis:</HI> Plaine Force is
not enough, there must be an accession of Fraude. There
<PB N="51" REF="29">
is that common sense in the Creatures, to auoyde their

nor Birdes with a bare Pipe, though it goe sweetly:
nor Beastes with <HI>Briareus</HI> strength onely, though he had
an hundred hands. Heere <HI>Actus pollentior armis.</HI> Fishes
must haue a Baite, Birdes a Nette; and hee that takes
Beastes, must be a <HI>cunning Hunter. Can a Bird fall into a
Snare vpon the earth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos. 3. 5.</NOTE> <HI>where no Ginne is for him?</HI> Nay, often
both Vises &amp; Deuices, Toyles and Toylings, Strength
and Stratagems, are all too little.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A cunning Hunter.</HEAD>
<P>It appeares, that <HI>Esaus</HI> delight was not to surprise
tame Beastes, that did him seruice; but wilde: For, a|gainst
the former, there needed no such <HI>cunning.</HI> How
easily is the Oxe brought to the Yoake, the Horse to
the Bitte, the Lambe to the Slaughter? His intention and
contention was against wild and noxious creatures.</P>
<P>This Obseruation teacheth vs to doe no violence to
the Beastes, that serue vs. <HI>Salomon</HI> stampes this Marke
on the good mans Fore-head, that <HI>hee is mercifull to his
Beast.</HI> And the Law of God commanded, that <HI>The mouth
of the Oxe should not be mussled, that treadeth out the Corne.</HI>
God opened the mouth of an Asse to reprooue the fol|ly
of <HI>Balaam;</HI> who strucke her vndeseruedly for not
going forward, when Gods Angell stood <HI>ad oppositum.</HI></P>
<P>Those sports are then intollerable, wherein we vexe
those Creatures, that spend their strengths for our bene|fites.
God therefore often iustly suffers them to know
their owne power, and to reuenge themselues on our
ingratitude. The <HI>Romane</HI> Southsayers diuined; that
when Bulles, Dogges, and Asses, (Beastes created for
vse and obedience) grew madd on a sodaine, <HI>Bellum ser|uile
imminebat,</HI> it boded some seruile Warre and Insur|rection.
But wee may truly gather, that when God

<P>AS <HI>Cunning</HI> as hee was to take Beastes, hee had litle
cunning to saue himselfe. How foolish was hee, to
part with his Birthright for a messe of Lentile Pottage?
And since there is a necessary discussion of his Folly,
as well as of his <HI>Cunning,</HI> I will take here iust occasion
to demonstrate it: and that in fiue Circumstances.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="30">
1. Hee had a rauenous and intemperate desire. This
appeares by three phrases he vsed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 30.</NOTE> 1. <HI>Feed mee, I pray
thee;</HI> Satisfie, saturate, satiate mee: or, let mee swallow
at once, as some read it: The words of an appetite in|sufferable
of delay. 2. To shew his eagernesse, hee dou|bles
the word for haste: <HI>With that Red,</HI> with that <HI>Red</HI>
Pottage. <HI>Red</HI> was his colour, <HI>Red</HI> his desire: Hee coue|ted
<HI>Red</HI> Pottage, hee dwelt in a <HI>red</HI> soyle; called thereon,
<HI>Idumea:</HI> and in the Text, <HI>Therefore was his name called
Edom.</HI> 3. Hee sayes, <HI>I am faint:</HI> and ver. 32. at the poynt
<HI>to die,</HI> if I haue it not: Like some longing soules, that
haue so weake a hand ouer their appetites, that they
must <HI>die,</HI> if their humour be not fulfilled. Wee may here
inferre two Obseruations.</P>
<P>1. That Intemperance is not onely a filthy, but a foo|lish
sinne. It is impossible, that a rauenous Throate
should lie neere a sober Braine: There may be in such a
man, vnderstanding and reason; but he neither heares
that, nor followes this. A Citie may haue good Lawes,
though none of them be kept. But as in sleepers and
mad-men, there is <HI>Habitus rationis, non vsus et actus:</HI> Such
men haue reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sen. ep. 21. ad Lucil.</NOTE> but want the actiue vse. <HI>Venter prae|cepta
non audit:</HI> The belly hath no eares. Though you
would write such mens Epitaphs whiles they are liuing,
yet you cannot;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. ep. 60.</NOTE> for <HI>Mortem suam antecesserunt,</HI> they
haue antedated their death, and buried themselues aliue:
as the French prouerbe sayes, They haue digged their
Graue with their Teeth. The Philosopher passing
through <HI>Vacia</HI> the Epicures grounds, sayd; <HI>Hic suus est
Vacia:</HI> not heere hee liues, but heere hee lies; as it were
dead and sepulcherd. The parcimonie of ancient times
hath been admirable. The <HI>Arcadians</HI> liued on Acornes:

<P>2. That a man may epicurise on course fare: For
<HI>Lentile</HI> Pottage was no extraordinarie fine dyet. But as
a man may be a <HI>Crassus</HI> in his Purse, yet no <HI>Cassius</HI> in his
Pottes: So on the contrary, an other may be (as it is said
of <HI>Iob</HI>) Poore to a prouerbe; yet be withall, as volup|tuous
as <HI>Esau.</HI> Men haue <HI>talem dentem, qualem mentem:</HI>
Such an Appetite as they haue Affection. And <HI>Esau</HI>
may be as great a Glutton in his Pottage, as those <HI>greedy
Dogges.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 56. 12.</NOTE> (<HI>Esay</HI> 56.) that <HI>fill</HI> themselues <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th strong Wines:</HI> or
those fatte <HI>Bulles (Am</HI> 6.)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos. 6. 4.</NOTE> that <HI>eate the Lambes and Calues
out of the Stall.</HI> Thus the poore may sinne as much in
their Throate, as the rich: and be Epicures <HI>tam Lat&egrave;,</HI>
though not <HI>tam laut&egrave;,</HI> in as immoderate, though not so
daintie Fare. Indeede Labour in many bodies requires
a more plentifull repast, then ease: and the sedentarie
Gentleman needes not so much Meate, as his drudging
Hind: But in both this Rule should be obserued; <HI>Quan|tum
naturae sufficiat, non quantum gulae placeat;</HI> Not what
will please the Throate, but what will content Nature:
to eate what a man should, not what hee would. The
Poore man that loues delicate Cheare, shall not bee
Wealthy: and the Rich man that loues it, shall not be
Healthy. As <HI>cunning</HI> as <HI>Esau</HI> was, heere is one instance
of his folly, <HI>An intemperate Appetite.</HI></P>
<P>2. His Folly may be argued, from his base estimati|on
of the Birthright; that he would so lightly part from
it, and on so easie conditions, as <HI>Pottage.</HI> It seemes, hee
did measure it onely by the pleasures and commodities
of this life, which were affoorded him by it. ver. 32. <HI>I am
ready to die: and what profite shall this Birthright doe m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e?</HI>
Which words import a limitation of it to this present
World, as if it could doe him no good afterwards.
Whereupon the <HI>Hebrews</HI> gather, that he denyed the Re|surrection.
<PB N="55" REF="31">
For this cause the Apostle brands him with
the marke of <HI>Prophanesse.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 16.</NOTE> Heb. 12. that he changed a Spi|rituall
Blessing for a Temporall Pleasure.</P>
<P>And what, O yee <HI>Esauites,</HI> Worldlings, are momen|tany
Delights compared to Eternall? What is a messe
of Gruell, to the Supper of Glory? The Belly is plea|sed
the Soule is lost. Neuer was any Meate, except the
forbidden Fruite, so dearely bought, as this Broth of
<HI>Iacob:</HI> A Curse followed both their feedings. There is
no Temporall thing without the trouble, though it be
farre more worthy then the <HI>Lentile</HI>-Pottage. Hath a man
good things, hee feares to forgoe them: and when hee
must, could either wish they had not been so good, or a
longer possession? Hath he euill, they bring griefe; and
hee either wisheth them good, or to be rid of them? So
that good things trouble vs with feare, euill with sor|row.
Those in the future, these in the present. Those, be|cause
they shall end: these, because they doe not end.
Nothing then can make a man truly-happy, but Eter|nitie.
Pleasures may last a while in this world; but
they wil grow old with vs&punc; if they doe not die before vs.
And the Staffe of Age is no Pole of eternitie. Hee then
hath too much of the sensuall and <HI>Prophane</HI> blood of <HI>Esau</HI>
in him, that will sell euerlasting Birthrights and Com|forts,
for transient Pleasures.</P>
<P>3. Another Argument of his folly, was Ingratitude
to God; who had in mercie vouchsafed him, (though
but by a few minutes) the priuiledge of Primogeniture:
Wherewith Diuines hold, that the Priesthood was also
conueyed. The Father of the Family exercised it du|ring
his life; and after his decease the first borne succee|ded
in that with the Inheritance. And could <HI>Esau</HI> be
ingratefull to a God so gracious? Or could he possibly
haue aspired to a higher dignitie? Wretched Vnthank|fulnesse,
how iustly art thou branded for a Prodegie in
<PB N="56" REF="32">
Nature? There are too many, that in a sullen neglect,
ouerlooke all Gods fauours, for the want of one of their
Affections long after. <HI>Non tam agunt gratias de Tribuna|tu,
quam queruntur, quod non sunt euecti in Consulatum:</HI> It is
nothing with them to be of the Court, except they be
also of the Councell.</P>
<P>4. His Obstinacie taxeth his Follie; that after cold
blood, leasure to thinke of the Treasure he sold, and di|gestion
of his Pottage, hee repented not of his Rashnes;
But ver. 34. <HI>Hee did eate, and drinke, and rose vp, and went his
way:</HI> Filled his Belly, rose vp to his former Customes,
and went his way without a <HI>Quid faeci?</HI> Therefore it is
added, <HI>Hee despised his Birthright.</HI> Hee followed his Plea|sures
without any interception of Sorrow, or interrup|tion
of Conscience. His whole life was a circle of sin|full
Customes; and not his Birthrights losse can put
him out of them. A circular thing implies a perpetuitie
of motion, according to Mathematicians. It begins
from all parts alike, <HI>et in seipso definit,</HI> endes absolutely
in it selfe, without any poynt or scope obiectuall to
moue to. Earth was <HI>Esaus</HI> home; hee lookes after no o|ther
felicitie: therefore goes his way with lesse thought
of an heauenly Birthright, then if hee had missed the
Deare hee hunted. It is wicked to sell Heauenly things
at a great rate of Worldly: but it is most wretched to
vilipend them.</P>
<P>5. Lastly, his Perfidious nature appeareth, that
though hee had made an absolute Conue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ance of his
Birthright to <HI>Iacob,</HI> and sealed the Deed with an Oath;
yet hee seemed to make but aiest of it, and purposed in
his heart not to performe it. Therefore chap. 27. 41. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
said in his heart, the dayes of mourning for my Father are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t
hand, then will I s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ay my br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ther Iacob.</HI> Hee tarryed but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
the Funerall of his Father, and then resolued to sende
<PB N="57" REF="32">
his Brother after him; as <HI>Cain</HI> did <HI>Abel&punc;</HI> because hee was
more accepted. It is hard to iudge, whether he was a
worse Sonne or a Brother: Hee hopes for his Fathers
death, and purposeth his Brothers; and vowes to shed
bloud in stead of Teares.</P>
<P>Perhappes from his example, those desperate Wret|ches
of <HI>England</HI> drew their instuction. They had sold
their Birthright, and the Blessing which <HI>Iesus</HI> Christ,
like old <HI>Isac</HI> dying, bequeathed in his Will to all belee|uers,
and all the interest in the truth of the Gospell, to
the <HI>Pope</HI> for a few Pottage, <HI>red</HI> Pottage, dyed in their
owne blood for seeking to colour it with the blood of
Gods Annoynted, and of his Saints. And now in a ma|licious
rancour, seeing the Children of Truth to enioy
as much outward peace, as they were conscious of an
inward vexation: they expected but <HI>Diem Luctus,</HI> the
dayes of Mourning, when God should translate our
late Queene of eternally-blessed memorie, from a King|dome
on Earth, to a better in Heauen: and then hoped,
like Busterds in a Fallow field, to rayse vp their heauy
Fortunes, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> turbinis,</HI> by a Whirlewind of Commotion.
But our <HI>Pacator Orbis,</HI> (which was the reall attribute of
<HI>Constantine</HI>) beguiled their enuious Hopes. And as <HI>Pa|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rculus</HI>
said of the <HI>Romane</HI> Empire after <HI>Augustus</HI> death,
when there was such hope of Enemies, feare of Friends,
expectation of trouble in all; <HI>Tanta suit vnius viri Ma|iestas,
vt nec bonis, neque contra malos opus foret armis:</HI> Such
was the maiestie of one man, that his very presence
tooke away all vse of Armes. Our royall <HI>Iacob</HI> preclu|ded
all Stratagems, preuented all the Plots of these ma|licious
<HI>Esauites,</HI> and setled vs both in the fruition of the
Gospell, and peace with it. But in meane time, God did
punish their persidious machinations; as hee will doe
Periurie and Treason, wheresouer hee finde them. For
hee will naile vpon the Head of the Periurer, his Oath
trayterously broken.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="33">
IN all these circumstances it appeareth, that though
<HI>Esau</HI> was subtile to take Beastes; hee had no <HI>cunning</HI> to
hunt out his owne Saluation. From all which scatte|red
Stones brought togeather let mee raise this building
of Instruction.</P>
<P>The wisest for the World are most commonly Fooles
for Celestiall blessings. Wicked men can <HI>Sentire quae

Warre, they haue their Stratagems: Let them plot in

Nettes: Fowling Ginnes: Fishing Baites: not so much
as euen in Husbandry, but the professors haue their
reaches: they know, which way the Market goes,
which way it will goe. Your Tradesmen haue their
Mysteries: Misteries indeed, for the mysterie of Ini|quitie
is in them: they haue a stocke of good Wordes,
to put off a stocke of badde Wares: in their particular
qualities they are able to schoole <HI>Machiuell.</HI></P>
<P>But draw them from their Center Earth, and out of
their Circumference Worldly policies; and you haue
not more simple Fooles: They haue no acquaintance
with Gods Statutes, and therefore no maruell, if they
misiudge Vices for Vertues; as <HI>Zebul</HI> told <HI>Gaal,</HI> that hee

<P>WEe haue taken the first branch of his Character,
the maine proportion of his Picture: <HI>Hee was a

of the Proposition, sauing it hath a little larger
extent, I doe no more but name it.</P>
<P>Wee doe not thinke, because hee is called, <HI>A man of

as the <HI>Septuagint</HI> call him, <HI>A Field-man,</HI> in regard that
hee was continually conuersant in the Field: There
was his sport, there was his heart. Therefore (ver. 28.)
<HI>did Isaac loue Esau, because he did eate of his Venison:</HI> Hee
loued his Venison, not his Conditions. Some would

But the other reading is better; sauing that by the

For an ordinary Dogges byting doth not

<P>1. These two Brethren were borne togeather, were

there in their composition of Bodyes, in their disposi|tion
of Mindes, in their euents of Life; or as they say,
in their Fortunes?</P>
<P>1. For Bodyes: One was rough and Hairy, the other

or neuer in two borne at one birth. And wee may goe

Twinnes conceaued togeather, borne togeather; yet
of as different natures and qualities, as if a vast locall
distance had sundred their Births; or as if the originary

Preclusion of all Star-predictions out of this

I will be bold to cast the Destinie of their Profession,
and honestly lay open their Iuggling in sixe Argu|ments.</P>
<P>1. The falshood of their <HI>Ephimerides.</HI> The Progno|sticators,
as if they were Midwiues to the Celestiall
bodyes, plead a deepe insight into their secrets: or as
if like Physitians they had cast the Vrine of the Clouds,
and knew, where the fitte held them; that it could nei|ther
raine nor hayle, till some Starre had first made
them acquainted with it. Demonstration hath proo|ued
these so false and ridiculous, that they may rather
<HI>Commouere nauseam qu&agrave;m bilum,</HI> and <HI>risum</HI> more then
both.</P>
<P>Perhaps when some appoynt Raine on such a day,
some Frost, others Snow, a fourth Winde, a last calme
and faire weather; some of these may hit, some of these
must hit: But lightly hee that against his knowledge
told true to day, lyes to morrow: and hee that lyed
<PB N="64" REF="36">
yesterday, may happen right next day; as a blinde
Archer may kill a Crow.</P>
<P>For this cause (I thinke) some were called <HI>Erring,</HI> or
Wandring Starres: not so much that they were vncer|taine
in their owne seates and motions, as because they
caused to erre their Clients and gaping Inquisitors.
And so they are called <HI>Erring</HI> in the same phrase and
sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pallidamors</NOTE> as Death is called Pale; not that it is Pale it selfe,
but because it makes those Pale it seasseth on: And
Winter durtie, not <HI>formaliter,</HI> but <HI>secundum effectum,</HI> be|cause
it maketh the Earth durty. So that rather their
owne speculations by the Starres, then the Starres, are
erring: both <HI>Decepto sensu cum iudicio, et corruptis or|ganis.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore some of the subtler, haue deliuered their
opinions in such spurious, enigmaticall, dilogicall
termes, as the Diuell gaue his Oracles; that since Hea|uen
will not follow their Instructions, their Constructi|ons
shall follow Heauen. And because the Weather
hath not fallen out, as they haue before tolde, they will
now tell as the weather falles out. So that reading their
Bookes you would thinke, as the Beggars haue their
<HI>Canting,</HI> they had got a new Language out of the Ele|ments,
which the poore Earth neuer did or shall vnder|stand:
And it is thought, that <HI>Canting</HI> is the better Lan|guage,
because it is not so ambitious, as to meddle
with the Starres: Whereof the Prognosticators head
comes as short, as his tongue doth of the Beggars elo|quence.</P>
<P>2. The state of Fortune-tellers, and Prophecie-vsur|pers:
which is not onely poore and beggarly, as if the
enuious Earth refused to relieue those, that could fetch
their liuing out of the Starres; but also ridiculous.
<Q><L>Nil habet infaelix paupertas durius in se,</L>
<L>Qu&agrave;m qu&ograve;d r&igrave;diculos homines facit.</L></Q>
This is not all; but they are vtterly ignorant of their
<PB N="65" REF="36">
owne destinies. Now <HI>Quisibi nescius, cui praescius?</HI> Hee
that is a Foole for himselfe, how should hee be wise for

and told him, that <HI>Iupiters</HI> wrath might be appeased by
sacrificing the Blood of a <HI>Stranger.</HI> The Tyrant asked
him, What Country-man he was, of <HI>Egipt,</HI> or an aliant?
Hee told him, a Stranger.

<Q><L>Thou, quoth the Tyrant, art that lucky guest,</L>
<L>Whose Blood shall wet our soyle, and giue vs rest.</L></Q>
It is reported that <HI>Biron,</HI> that <HI>French</HI> Martiall, came to
an Astrologer, to know the future successe of his Plots;
which because hee gaue disastrous, the angry Duke be|gun
to his mischieuous intendments, in the Fate-tellers

such a Booke, after throwing it into the fire:</P>
<Q><L>Thy Authour foretels much: alas! weake frend:</L>
<L>That hee could not prognosticate thy end.</L></Q>
<P>3. The quicke moouing of the Celestiall bodies, and
their remotenesse from our eyes: Both our sense is too
weake to pierce into those Fires; and those Fires are
too quicke in motion for our apprehension. Therefore

immediatly borne after the other, that the same part of

vnder the raigne of one Planet or Constellation; yet as
different in Natures, as the Planets themselues.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="37">
To this they answere, that euen this cause, the swift
motion of the Planets, wrought this diuersitie: because

This would one <HI>Nigidius</HI> demonstrate, who vpon
a Wheele turning with all possible swiftnesse, let dropat

hee would demonstrate, that in a small course of
time, a great part of the celestiall Gloabe may be turned
about. But this S. <HI>Austin</HI> soundly returns on them:
That if the Planetarie courses, and Celestiall motions
be so swift, it can not be discerned vnder what Con|stellation
any one is borne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 10. sup. Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ng.</NOTE> And <HI>Gregory</HI> wittily de|rides
their folly, that if <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> were not there|fore
borne vnder one Constellation, because they came
foorth one after another. By the same reason, nei|ther
can any one be borne vnder one Constellation,
because hee is not borne all at once, but one part after
another.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Vitabreuis hominum:</HI> Mans short and brittle life.
If our age were now, as it was with the Patriarches,
when the Stagge, the Rauen, and long-liu'd Oake, com|pared
with mans life, dyed very young: They
might then obserue and vnderstande the motion and
reuolution of the Starres, and behold their effectes:
when if any Starre had long absented it selfe from their
contemplation, they could stay two or three hundred
yeares to see it againe: But now as an English Nigh|tingale
sung;
<Q><L>Who liues to age,</L>
<L>Fitte to be made Methushalem his Page?</L></Q></P>
<P>On necessitie this Astrologer must liue so long, as to
haue obserued the life of such a man, borne vnder such a
Planet: and after him of another borne in the like maner.
Nay, he must ouertake the yeares of <HI>Methusoalem</HI> in the
<PB N="67" REF="37">
successiue contemplation of such experiments. But this
life is not giuen, therefore not this knowledge.</P>
<P>5. The infinite number of the Starres take from them
all possibilitie of infallible predictions. They cannot
giue their generall number, and can they giue their
singular natures? To attempt it, is <HI>Imprudentia caecissima;</HI>
to affirme it, <HI>Impudentia effrontissima,</HI> blinde dotage,
shamelesse impudence.</P>
<P>6. The various Disposition, Conditions, Natures,
and Studies, <HI>coaetaneorum,</HI> of such as are borne togea|ther.
So <HI>Gregory</HI> reasons of these Twinnes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 10. in Euang.</NOTE> <HI>Cum eodem

<P>If we may giue credite, that <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus</HI> were

taken togeather and nourished of a shee-Wolfe, both
building and chalenging <HI>Rome;</HI> yet <HI>Romulus</HI> slew his
brother, and got the Kingdome of that Citie, and after
his owne name called it <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P>Are their Prev: any man that either their witte or vi|olence
can practise on. Not so much Beggars; yet they
would be content to Hunt them also out of their Coasts:
but those that haue somewhat worth their Gaping af|ter;
and whose estates may Minister some Gobbets to
their Throtes. <HI>Aquila non Capit muscas:</HI> the Eagles hunt
no Flyes, so long as their be Foules in the Ayre. The
Commonaltie, that by great Labour haue gotten a little
stay for themselues; these they Hunt, and lay along,
and Prey on their prostrate Fortunes.</P>
<P>If they be Tenantes, woe is them. Fines, Rents, Car|riagas,
slaueries shall drinke vp the Sweat of their
Browes. There is law against Coyners; and it is made
treason iustly to stampe the Kings Figure in Mettalles:
But what is Mettall to a Man, the Image of God? And
we haue those that coyne Money on the poores Sinnes:
Traytors they are to the King of Kings.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="39">
The whole Countrey shall feele their hunting. They
hunt Commons into Seueralles; Tilled grounds into
Pastures, that the Gleaning is taken from the Poore,
which God commaunded to be left them; and all suc|cour,
except they can grase in the High-wayes. And
to others, to whom their Rage cannot extend, their Craft
shall: for they will hoyst them in the Subsidies, or ouer|charge
them for the Warres, or vexe them with Quar|rels
in Law, or perhaps their Seruants shall in direct
tearmes beat them. <HI>Naboth</HI> shall hardly keepe his Vin|yard,

It is an Extorting, not a Purchasing.</P>
<P>Thus the Poore man, is the Beast they <HI>hunt:</HI> who must
rise early, rest late, eate the Bread of sorrow, sitte with
many a hungry meale, perhaps his Children crying for
Food, whiles all the fruite of his paines is serued in to
<HI>Nimrods</HI> Table. Complaine of this whiles you will,

Indeed a Monny-man may not be damnified, but
hee may be damned. For this is a <HI>Crying sinne,</HI> and the

<P>You see the Beastes they <HI>hunt:</HI> Not Foxes, not Wolues
nor Boares, Bulles, nor Tygers. It is a certaine obserua|tion;
no Beast hunts the owne kind to deuoure it. Now
if these should prosecute Wolues, Foxes, &amp;c. they
<PB N="72" REF="40">
should then <HI>hunt</HI> their owne kind: for they are these
themselues; or rather worse then these: because here
<HI>Homo homini Lupus.</HI> But though they are Men they <HI>hunt,</HI>
and by nature of the same kind; they are not so by qua|litie:
For they are Lambes they persecute: In them
there is Blood, and Flesh, and Fleece, to be had: and
therefore on these doe they gorge themselues. In them
there is weake Armour of defence against their cruel|ties;
therefore ouer these they may domineere. I will
speake it boldly: There is not a mighty <HI>Nimrod</HI> in this
Land, that dares <HI>hunt</HI> his equall: But ouer his inferiour
Lambe hee insultes, like a young <HI>Nero.</HI> Let him be
graced by High ones, and hee must not be saluted vn|der
twelue score off. In the Countrie hee proues a
Termagaunt: his very Scowle is a Prodegie, and breeds
an Earthquake. Hee would be a <HI>Caesar,</HI> and taxe all:
It is well if hee prooue not a <HI>Caniball.</HI> Onely <HI>Macro</HI>
salutes <HI>Seianus</HI> so long as hee is in <HI>Tiberius</HI> his fauour:
Cast him from that Pinacle, and the Dogge is ready to
deuoure him.</P>
<P>You heare the Obiect, they <HI>hunt;</HI> attende the Manner.
And this you shall finde, as <HI>Esau's,</HI> to consist in two
things: <HI>Force,</HI> and <HI>Fraude.</HI> They are not onely <HI>Hunters,</HI>
but <HI>cunning Hunters.</HI></P>
<P>1. For their <HI>Force,</HI> they are <HI>Robusti latrones,</HI> and haue
a violent impetuous, imperious Hunting.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 59. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Desolation and
destruction are in their Pathes.</HI> We may say of them, as <HI>Ter|tullian</HI>
sayd of the <HI>Montanists. Nontam Laborant vt aedifica|rent

their owne encreasing as the depopulation of others.
Philosophers hold the world to be composed of three
concurrent principles, Matter, Forme, and Priuation:
holding the last, to be rather a principle of Transmu|tation,
then of Establishment. Oppressours besides the
<PB N="73" REF="40">
Matter, which is the Common-wealth; and the Forme
which is Iustice; haue deuised to make necessarie also
Priuation.</P>
<P>There are sinnes, which striue onely <HI>Intra orbem suum
<UNCLEAR>urere</UNCLEAR>:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sen.</NOTE> which haue no further latitude then the Consci|ence
of the Committer: They are Priuate and Domesti|call
sinnes: the sting whereof dies in the proprietary.
Such are Prodigality, Enuie, Sloth, Pride. Though euill
example may doe somewhat, they haue no further ex|tention.
But some are of so wild a nature, that they are
Mallets and Swords to the whole Country about them.
And these are districtly, the sinnes of the Hand. So
Micah. 2.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mic 2. 2.</NOTE> <HI>They couet Fieldes, and take them by Violence: and
Houses, and t&agrave;ke them away: so they &ograve;ppresse a man and his
house, euen a man and his Heritage.</HI> Why doe they all this,
but because <HI>Manus potest.</HI> ver. 1. <HI>It is in the power of their
Hand.</HI> And they measure their power, sayth <HI>Seneca,</HI> by
the Span,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Benef. lib. 1.</NOTE> by the reach of their Hands. <HI>Iniurijs vires me|tuntur.
Anaxagoras</HI> thought man the wisest of all Crea|tures,
because he hath Handes, whereby he can expresse
all signes. He might haue concluded him the Wickedest
of all Creatures, <HI>quia manuatus,</HI> because he hath Hands.
For no Tyger or Vulture vnder Heauen is more hurt|full
with his Clawes and Tallents, then Man with his
Hands. <HI>Achilles</HI> asked <HI>Palamedes</HI> going to the <HI>Troyan</HI>
Warres, Why hee went without a Seruant? Hee shewed
him his hands, and told him they were <HI>Loco seruorum,</HI>
in stead of many seruants. <HI>Manus organum organorum.</HI>
Their dexteritie and aptnesse chargeth them with
sinnes, whereof the other parts are no lesse Guilty.</P>
<P>For the most part, those Beasts haue least immanitie
that haue most strength. Oxen and Horses and Ele|phants
are tame and seruicable, but Bees and Hornets
haue Stings. So wisely hath the Creator disposed, that
there may not be a Coniunction <HI>et Potentiae et Maleuolen|tiae:</HI>
that might and malice may not meete. So they are
<PB N="74" REF="41">
suffered to haue Will to hurt, &amp; not Power; or Power,
and not will. The curst Cow hath short Hornes: But
these <HI>Hunters</HI> haue got both. The Poet sayth:
<Q><L>That Lyons doe not prey on yeelding things,</L>
<L>Pittie's infeoffed to the blood of Kings.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Posse et nolle, nobile:</HI> That thou mayst harme and wilt
not, is <HI>laus tua,</HI> thy prayse: that thou wouldest and canst
not, <HI>gratia Dei,</HI> is Gods prouidence. <HI>Haman</HI> would hang
<HI>Mordecai</HI> and cannot: hee is a villaine in Hell for his

hurt and would not: hee is a Saint in Heauen. <HI>Shimei</HI>
would, but can not kill (though rayle on) <HI>Dauid: Dauid</HI>
can, and will not kill <HI>Shimei.</HI> The hote Disciples would
haue Fire from Heauen to destroy the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> and

How rare is a man of this disposition among vs? If ad|uantage

is in the Wolues Caue with more securitie. Plead what
thou wilt, prostrate thy owne innocence, aggrauate the
Oppressors crueltie: hee answeres as <HI>Esopes</HI> Wolfe an|swered
the Lambe; <HI>Thy Cause is better then mine, but my

<P>You haue read how the Badger entertain'd the Hedg|hogge

manerly desired him to depart in kindnesse, as he came.
The Hedge-hog thus satisfies his iust expostulation;

<P>They haue their Bandogs, corrupt Soliciters, Parrat-Lawyers;

<P>Thus I haue shewed you a Fielde of <HI>Hunters:</HI> what
should I adde, but my Prayers to Heauen, and desires to
Farth, that these <HI>Hunters</HI> may be hunted. The <HI>hunting</HI> of
harmefull Beastes is commended; the Wolfe, the Boare,
the Beare, the Foxe, the Tyger, the Otter. But the me|taphoricall
<HI>hunting</HI> of these is more prayse worthy: the
Country-wolues, or Cittie-Foxes deserue most to be
Hunted. <HI>Non est meae Paruitatis, &amp;c.</HI> I am to shallow to
aduise you <HI>Demodo:</HI> I onely wish it might be done: they
that haue authoritie to doe it, know best the meanes, I
will but discouer the Game, and leaue it to their Hun|ting:
naming the persons they should Hunt: they
know the Hounds where withall.</P>
<P>1 There is the wilde Boare, that breakes ouer Gods
mounds and spoyles his Vineyeard.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 80. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Psal. 80. The Boare
<PB N="78" REF="43">
out of the Wood doth waste it: and the wild Beast of the Field,
doth deuoure it.</HI> This is the depopulator, that will for|rage
and lay all waste, if he be not restrained. What;
Doe you call him a wasting Boare? hee rather enclo|seth
all, breaketh vp none. Yes, hee layes waste to the
Common-wealth, though hee encloseth to himselfe.
Hee wasteth Societies, Communitie, Neighbourhood
of people; turnes them out of their auncient Dores,
sendes them to the wide World to begge their Bread.
Hee is a bloody Boare, and hath two damnable Tuskes:
Money to make him Friendes, and to charme conni|uence:
And a wicked Conscience, that cares not to
swimme to Hell in Blood. The brawny Shield of this
Boare, whereby hee beares off all blowes of Curses, is
the securitie of his owne dead Heart: Hee thinkes the
Cryes and Vlulations of Widdowes and Orphans, the
best Musicke. When the hand of God strikes him, (as
strike him it will, and that fearefully) hee euen rouseth
and rageth on him; and dyes like an angry Boare, foa|ming
at mouth, as if hee were spitting defyance at Hea|uen.
Let this Beast be <HI>Hunted.</HI></P>
<P>2. There is the Foxe, the craftie Cheater, that steales
the Grapes. Cant. 2. <HI>Take in the Foxes, &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 2. 15.</NOTE> It is Gods
charge to hunt him. Hee turnes Beastes out of their
Dennes by defyling them. Hee sold his Conscience to
the Diuell for a stocke of villanous Witte. Hee hath a
stinking Breath;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin.</NOTE> corrupted with Oathes and Lies:
and a rauenous Throat to prey vpon mens simplenesse.
If all tricks fayle, hee will counterfeit himselfe dead,
that so drawing the Fowles to feed vpon him, hee may
feed vpon them. The Defrauder puts on a semblance
of great smoothnesse; you would take him for a won|derfull
honest man: Soft, you are not yet within his
clutches; when you are, Lord haue mercy on you, for
hee will haue none.</P>
<P>3. There is the bloody Wolfe; the profest cutthroat
<PB N="79" REF="43">
the Vsurer. <HI>Hunt</HI> him, sease on his Denne; it is full of
pooremens Goods. What a Golden Law would that
bee, which were called a Statute of Restitution: Such a
one as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> enacted. <HI>Neh.</HI> 5. that Lands and Vine|yards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nehe. 5. 11.</NOTE>
Houses and Goods, morgag'd into Vsurers
hands, should be <HI>restored.</HI> When hee sealed it with a
sacramentall Oath, and made them sweare consent to it.
<HI>And hee shooke his Lappe, and sayd. So God shake out euery
man from his house, and from his labour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 13.</NOTE> that performeth not
this Promise; euen thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And
all the Congregation sayd, Amen.</HI> But if they will not re|store
by themselues, they shall by their posteritie. For,
as <HI>Plinie</HI> writes of the <HI>Wolfe,</HI> that it brings foorth blind
Whelps: so the Vsurer lightly begets blind Children,
that cannot see to keepe what their Father left them.
But when the Father is gone to Hell for gathering, the
Sonne often followes for scattering. But God is iust.
<HI>A good man leaueth his Inheritance to his Children Children:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro&punc; 13. 22.</NOTE>
and the Wealth of the sinner is laid vp for the iust.</HI></P>
<P>4. There is also the Badger, a Beast of rapine: Wee
haue his fellowes among vs, the Ingrossers of Corne,
the Raysers of the price, sweeping away whole Mar|kets:
Wee call these Badgers. The Poore that comes
with a litle Money, cannot speed; but at an vnreasona|ble
rate: they ingrosse all. And by their Capacitie, or
rather Rapacitie, hauing so much in their hands, they
sell it at the place of their transporting, at their owne
price.</P>
<P>5. The Dromedarie would also be better <HI>hunted:</HI>
I meane the vagrant Rogues, whose whole life is no|thing
but an exorbitant course: the maine begging,
the by's silching and stealing: Onely they are not so
seruiceable as the Dromedary; which is a Beast of
quicke feete, and strange speed. The reason is giuen
by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> because the extreame heate of Nature doth
waste all the vnctuositie and fatnesse, and thereby giues
<PB N="80" REF="44">
greater agilitie. But these Dromedaries are not swift:
Let one charitable Constable amongst a hundred light
on him, and giue him correction, and a Pasport to his
(false-named) place of birth, and hee will not trauell a|boue
a Mile a day. Let them alone, and they will <HI>tra|uerse
their way<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 2. 23.</NOTE> which are no wayes: for they cannot
keepe the beaten path: let them be where they will, they
are neuer out of their way. They boast themselues of
the broode of <HI>Cain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> for they are perpetuall Runnagats.
If the Stoks and Whip-post can not stay their extraua|gancie,
there remaines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nely the Gal-house.</P>
<P>6. Let the roring <HI>Bull</HI> be <HI>hunted;</HI> the Bulles of <HI>Ba|san,</HI>
the Bulles of <HI>Rome;</HI> sent ouer by the Pope <HI>ad interi|tum,</HI>
either of vs or themselues: For their end is not
<HI>implere Ecclesiam,</HI> but <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">miterium;</HI> to fill Church-yards
with dead bodyes, not the Church with liuing soules.
No Seruice would be so welcome to them, as the <HI>Sicilian</HI>
Euensong, or the <HI>Parisian</HI> Mattens. But since no Drugge
is currant in their Shoppes, but <HI>Diacatholican,</HI> Treason
and Ruine; let it be first ministred to themselues to
purge their burning Feuers. And since the <HI>Pope</HI> sends
his <HI>Bulles</HI> into <HI>England</HI> so thicke, bellowing to call his
Calues togeather, and to excite their reuolting from
their Soueraigne; let them speed no otherwise then
those <HI>Bulles</HI> once did, that cald in an other <HI>Bull,</HI> which
was <HI>Bull</HI> the Hang-man: to dispatch them all.</P>
<P>If you be disposed to <HI>hunt, hunt</HI> these Beastes that
hauocke the Common-wealth: Let the Lambes alone,
they doe you much good, no hurt. And to this chase
vse all your skill: in this worke it shall be your com|mendation
to be <HI>cunniug Hunters.</HI> The Lord shall em|parke
you within the Pale of his owne mercifull Pro|uidence,
and restraine the sauage furie of your Enemies.
Let those, whom God hath made Maisters of this seri|ous
game, and giuen Commission to <HI>hunt</HI> vicious per|sons:
<PB N="81" REF="44">
Let euery particular man <HI>hunt</HI> Vice out of his
owne heart. If there be any violence to get the <HI>King|dome
of Heauen,</HI> vse it: if any policie to ouerthrow Satan
and his complices, against whom we wrastle, exercise it.
This Warre shall be your Peace. You shall helpe to
purge the Land of noxius Beastes; and clense your
owne hearts from those lustes; which if you <HI>hunt</HI> not to
death, shall <HI>hunt</HI> you to death; as the morall of <HI>Acteon.</HI>
And God that giues you this commaund and courage,
shall adde for it a mercifull recompence; taking you at

on this <HI>Day.</HI> All which, <HI>Eodem

<P><PB N="84" REF="46">
According to these three distinct <HI>Manifestations</HI>
of himselfe, they haue giuen this <HI>Day,</HI> three seuerall

<P>3. <HI>Bethphania:</HI> Because, (Ioh. 2.) he shewed the power

<P>Gods <HI>Leading</HI> was by a <HI>Starre.</HI> They that delight to
cast Cloudes vpon the cleare Sunne, haue heere mooted
many Questions about this <HI>Starre.</HI></P>
<P>1. Whether this <HI>Starre</HI> were singular, or an heape of
<HI>Starres.</HI> Our <HI>Romane</HI> aduersaries, to bring wilfull trou|ble
on themselues and vs, haue coniur'd a fiction from
one <HI>Albumazar</HI> a Heathen; that the Signe in the Zodi|acke,
call'd the <HI>Virgin,</HI> is composed of so many <HI>Starres,</HI>
as may aptly pourtray <HI>Virginem gestantem inter brachia
filium,</HI> a Virgin bearing an Infant in her armes: And
some of them haue thought that, this <HI>Starre.</HI></P>
<P>Let <HI>Albumazar</HI> be the father of this opinion; and
for a litle better authoritie, they haue motherd it on a
Prophecie of <HI>Tiburtine Sibylla</HI> when <HI>Augustus</HI> boasted his
super-humane Maiestie, <HI>Sibylla</HI> shewed him <HI>Virginem in
coelo Infanti portam,</HI> a Virgin in Heauen bearing a young
Child in her armes; with these wordes: <HI>Hic Puer maior
te est, ipsum adora,</HI> Yonder Infant is greater then thou
art, <HI>O Cesar,</HI> worship him.</P>
<P>But because the Father of this toy was an Ethnicke,
and the Mother thought a Sorceresse, they haue (as
somethinke, spight of his teeth) brought in <HI>Chrysostome</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Op. imperf. hom. 2. in 2. Math.</NOTE>
for a God-father to it; or to an opinion, if differing
<PB N="86" REF="47">
from it, yet also exceeding the truth of this Historie.
Whether of himselfe, or on their teaching, he sayes thus.
<HI>This Starre appeared to them descending vpon that victoriall
Mountaine, hauing in it the forme of a little Child; and aboue
him the similitude of a Crosse.</HI> But I confesse, (and loe the
great vaunts of their vnitie) that many of them are of
another minde.</P>

You plead, God cares not for our Sheepe and Oxen, or

then at the Pitch-forke; readier to pull in, then giue out.
But if the Lord hath sowne plentifull Seed, hee expects
plentifull Fruites; an answerable measure, heapen, and
shaken, and thrust togeather, and running ouer. If God
hath made the Bushell great, make not you the Pecke
small. Turne not the bountie of Heauen, to the scarcity

<Q><L>Pure Heart thy <HI>Gold,</HI> thy <HI>Myrrhe</HI> be Penitence:</L>
<L>And deuout Prayer be thy <HI>Frankincense.</HI></L></Q>
<P>In a word:</P>
<P>1. Offer vp to God thy <HI>Frankincense,</HI> Supplication
and Thanksgiuing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 141. 2.</NOTE> Psal. 141.) <HI>Let thy Prayer be set foorth

<P>2. Next, present to him thy <HI>Myrrhe,</HI> a chast and
mortified Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e. Let thine Eyes, like the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of the

Soule powre out flouds of sorrow for thy offences Wee
haue sinned, we haue sinned: O let the Lord behold our
Oblation of <HI>Myrrhe</HI> accept our Repentance.</P>
<P>3. Lastly, thou must giue thy <HI>Gold</HI> also: a pure <HI>Heart,</HI>
tryed in the Furnace of Affliction and sublim'd from all
corruption. And because God onely knowes the Heart,
and the World must iudge by thy Fruites; giue thy spiri|tuall
<HI>Gold</HI> to <HI>Christ,</HI> and thy temporall <HI>Gold</HI> to his poore
members. Here take with thee three Cautions.</P>
<P>1. That all these <HI>Gifts</HI> be deriued from an honest
Heart. It is said of these <HI>Magi, They opened their Treasurs,
and presented vnto him Gifts.</HI> Mans Heart is his <HI>Treasurie:</HI>
thou must open that, when thou presentest any <HI>Gift</HI> to
<PB N="100" REF="55">
the Lord. He that comes with an open Hand, and a shut
Heart, shall be answerd of God, as <HI>Belshazzar</HI> was of
<HI>Daniel; Keepe thy Rewards to thy selfe, and giue thy Giftes to
another.</HI></P>
<P>2. That thy <HI>Gifts</HI> obserue the true latitude of Deuo|tion;
which endeuours to extend it selfe to the glory of
God, the good of thy Brother, and the saluation of thy
owne Soule. And to all these three, may these three
<HI>Gifts</HI> of the <HI>Wise-men</HI> be preferred. The <HI>Incense</HI> of Prayer,
respects God: the <HI>Gold</HI> of Charitie respects our Neigh|bour:
and the <HI>Myrrhe</HI> of Mortification respects our
selues.</P>
<P>3. That you offer not onely one, but all these. It hath
been question'd, Whether these <HI>Magi</HI> did offer <HI>Singuli
singula,</HI> or <HI>singuli tria:</HI> But the consent of Diuines is, that
they gaue euery one all, <HI>Semel et fimul.</HI> Thy Oblation
will not be welcome, if any one of the three be missing;
<HI>Giue</HI> then all.</P>
<P>Some will giue <HI>Myrrhe,</HI> but not <HI>Frankincense:</HI> Some
will giue <HI>Frankincense,</HI> but not <HI>Myrrhe:</HI> and some will
giue <HI>Myrrhe</HI> and <HI>Frankincense,</HI> but not <HI>Gold.</HI></P>
<P>1. Some will giue <HI>Myrrhe,</HI> a strict Morall life, not
culpable of any grosse eruption, or scandalous impiety:
but not <HI>Frankincense.</HI> Their <HI>Prayers</HI> are thinne sowne;
therefore their Graces cannot come vp thicke. Perhaps
they feele no want; and then you know, <HI>Rarae fumant
faliorbus Arae:</HI> In their thought, they doe not stand in
any great need of God: when theydoe, they will offer
him some <HI>Incense.</HI> These liue a morally honest life, but
are scant of religious <HI>Prayers:</HI> and so may be said to of|fer
<HI>Myrrhe</HI> without <HI>Frankincense.</HI></P>
<P>2. Some will giue <HI>Frankincense: Pray</HI> frequently,
perhaps tediously; but they will giue no <HI>Myrrhe,</HI> not
mortifie or restraine their Concupiscence. The <HI>Phars|ses</HI>
had many Prayers; but neuer the fewer sinnes. These
mocke God, when they so often begge of him, that his
<PB N="101" REF="55">
<HI>Will</HI> may be done, when they neuer subdue their affecti|ons
to it. There are too many such among vs, that will
often ioyne with the Church in common Deuotions,
who yet ioyne with the world in common vices. These
make great smoakes of <HI>Frankincense,</HI> but let not fall one
droppe of <HI>Myrrhe.</HI></P>
<P>3. Some will giue both <HI>Myrrhe</HI> and <HI>Frankincense,</HI> but
by no meanes their <HI>Gold.</HI> I will giue (sayth the World|ling)
a Sober life; there's my <HI>Myrrhe:</HI> I will say my
Prayers, there's my <HI>Frankincense:</HI> but doe you thinke
I will part with my <HI>Gold?</HI> This same <HI>Gold</HI> lyes closer in
mens Hearts, then it doth in their Purses: You may as
well wring <HI>Hercules</HI> Clubbe out of his Fist, as a Penny
from their heapes, to charitable vses.</P>
<P>You haue read (2. Sam. 24. 24.) how <HI>Areunah, like a
King, gaue to the King Oxen for Sacrifice, and the Instruments
for Fuell:</HI> But <HI>Dauid</HI> answered, <HI>Shall I offer burnt Offerings
vnto the Lord my God, of that which doth cost mee nothing?</HI>
These men will giue God Oblations, and enough; pro|uided
they cost them nothing. The Vsurer must saue
his <HI>Gold</HI> for his idolatrous Eye, the Drunkard for his
Host, the Lustfull for his Whore, the Proude for his
Backe, the Epicure for his Belly: Can you hope they
will part from their <HI>Gold?</HI></P>
<Q>Aurum omnes, pulsaiam pietate, colunt,</Q>
<P>O this damn'd sinne of Couetousnesse; how many
it keepes from the Grace of God, and the Gates of Hea|uen?
Men thinke they can neuer haue <HI>Gold</HI> enough.
They write of the Toad, that shee eates of nothing but
the Earth; and thereof no more, then shee can hold in
her foote at once: and the reason they giue is, that shee
feares the Earth would be wasted, and none left. A fitte

Generations.</P>
<P>How this Sicknesse grouels a man! how it stoupes
him into Earth, into Hell! This Disease lyes in mens
Bones. I haue read of a Beggar, that passed by a com|pany
of Rich men, and earnestly besought their Almes,
complayning that hee had a secret Disease lying in his
Bones, that hee could not earne his lyuing: They in
charity gaue him somewat, and let him goe. One a|mong
the rest following him, would needes know of
him, what that secret Disease should be, seeing that out|wardly
hee seemed to ayle nothing. Quoth the Beggar,
you cannot see it, for it lyes in my Bones; and some call
it Idlenesse. You see many a Rich man, whose cuppe
of Wealth runnes ouer: you wonder to see him so mi|serable,
both to himselfe and others. Why, there is a
Disease that lyes in his Bones; that keepes him from
working the workes of Charitie, from relieuing his di|stressed
Brethren: you may call it <HI>Couetousnesse.</HI> They
will part with any thing, so they may keepe their <HI>Gold.</HI>
But we must giue our <HI>Gold</HI> too, with the rest: If wee of|fer
not all, <HI>Christ</HI> will accept none.</P>
<P>I will ende with a Consolation; for who can shutte
vp this Storie with aterrour? The Lord will so graci|ously
prouide for his, that in their greatest ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">emitie

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE world (I take it in <HI>Pauls</HI>

at once deformed and suttle.
And, as it is commonly seene,
that mishapen trunckes are

as it was said of the Emperour
<HI>Galba, Ingenium Galbae male
habitat;</HI> because he had an a|cute
witte, with an vncomely body: nature recompen|cing
her defection one way, with perfection another
way. So the world is become ill-fauoured, and shrewd|pated;
as politike in braine, as it is stigmatike in limbs.
<HI>Honestie,</HI> though it be elder then fraud, yet hath lost the
priuiledge in mens estimation: It may keepe the priori|tie,
<PB N="4" REF="59">
the superioritie is gone; and it must be faine <HI>to serue

<P><HI>Plaine-dealing</HI> was held a good cittisen, a good towns|man:
but Double-dealing, since hee came blustring in,
hath thrust him <HI>sedibus, aedibus;</HI> out of house and home;
out of repute among men, out of succour of friends;
out of Commons, and almost out of Canons; out of
his house in the Towne, and seate in the Church.</P>
<P>I will therefore call backe antiquitie, and present to
your eyes the puritie of the Primitiue times. For I may
say with <HI>Tertullian; Perfectiora prima:</HI> the neerer the
spring-head, the purer streames. Men, <HI>quo minus ab or|tu
aberant,</HI> might more perfectly discerne, and more
constantly follow the truth. <HI>Iacob</HI> is our exemplar, and
patterne of <HI>Plaine-dealing.</HI> He was a plaine man, dwel|ling
in tents.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Iacob,</HEAD>
<P>TAken in the proper sense, signifieth to supplant. In|deed
<HI>Esau</HI> abuseth it, <HI>Gen. 27. 36. Is he not rightly na|med
Iacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times. Hee
tooke away my Birth-right, and behold, now hee hath taken a|way
my Blessing.</HI> But <HI>Iacob</HI> did not steale away his birth|right;
but onely tooke the aduantage to buy, what
carelesse <HI>Esau</HI> was willing to sell. And hauing the Birth|right,
the Blessing did iustly belong to him: for the
birthright and the blessing were not to bee separated.
But this name was a prediction of that fell out after|wards,
for <HI>Iacob</HI> indeed <HI>supplanted</HI> and ouerthrew his
brother.</P>

For his Life, he was a <HI>Plaine-dealing</HI> man; simple,
and without fraud. Though some autithetically op|pose
it to <HI>Esau's</HI> roughnesse. That <HI>Esau was an hairy man,</HI>
but <HI>Iacob</HI> was <HI>Plaine</HI> &amp; smooth; without any semblance
to his brothers ruggednesse. We deny not, that <HI>Iacob</HI>
was so: that exposition is true, but not enough. It falls
short of that praise, which Gods spirit heere meanes
him. <HI>He was a Plaine man;</HI> without craft or subtiltie.</P>
<P>For his delight and profession, <HI>Hee dwelt in tents.</HI>
Which though the Hebrewes expound of frequenting
the tents of <HI>Sem</HI> and <HI>Heber</HI> for knowledge; is indeed
onely a description of such as liue in the fields, and em|ploy
themselues about cattell: and this wee frequently
finde to be <HI>Iacobs</HI> desire and practise. The good Patri|archs
were <HI>plaine men:</HI> plaine in their clothes; no seas

without hospitalitie: <HI>plaine</HI> in their dyet, as <HI>Iacob</HI> heere,
that fed on <HI>Lentil</HI>-pottage.</P>
<P>But hauing thus proposed <HI>Iacob</HI> for a Precedent of
<HI>Plaine-dealing:</HI> it is primarily necessary to prooue him

<P><HI>ESau</HI> is by some few minutes the elder; and that was
enough to giue him iust title to the Birthright. That
<HI>Iacob</HI> therefore might haue the better claime to it, hee
buyes that which hee could not winne: and by an ho|nest
art redeemes the losses of nature. But this action
smells of cunning, and seemes to marre the credite of
his <HI>Plaine-dealing.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>Iacob</HI> is accused for cruell and vncharitable dea|ling
with his brother. <HI>Esau</HI> comes hungry from the
field, he is ready to die for want of sustenance; he sees
his brother (in no such exigent) with food in his hand;
he breakes forth into an earnest complaint, intreating
<PB N="8" REF="62">
his commiseration: now, shall a brother deny reliefe to
his brother being ready to die, except vpon such intol|lerable
conditions? Sure it could be no lesse then a hard
measure, to take such aduantage of a brothers necessi|tie.
But it is answered, that there could not be any such
necessity of <HI>Esaus</HI> coueting <HI>Iacobs</HI> pottage; for there
was (if not lentile pottage) store of as good meate in
the house; able to haue giuen satisfaction to his hun|ger,
and ready enough at his request, being the elder
sonne. It was not then distressed needinesse, but insa|tiate
greedinesse, that wrought <HI>Esaus</HI> lust to <HI>Iacobs</HI> pot|tage.
And it is not vnfit, that the luxurious appetite
should pay for his follie.</P>
<P>2. But <HI>Iacob</HI> cannot be excused of couetousnesse;
that would set no lower a price on his pottage, then the
Birthright. Which comprehended many priuiledges;
prioritie, gouernement of the brethren, a double por|tion
to the rest, the Priesthood and right to sacrifice,
and (what yet further commended it) a type and figure
of euerlasting life. And will <HI>Iacob</HI> require such a Birth|right,
including all these priuiledges for a messe of pot|tage?
what tyrant could set such an Impost on a mar|chandise!
what citizen such a price on his engrossed
commodities? Heere was an exaction beyond the tax|ing
of <HI>Tiberius:</HI> an extortion more extreame then an
Vsurers. We answere, Not as the Hebrewes conceit,
that <HI>Iacob</HI> afterwards gaue a greater summe, and payd
this but as an earnest: the Scripture neyther expressing
directly, nor inferring by consequence any such mat|ter&punc;
But we say, that <HI>Iacob,</HI> by the instruction of his mo|ther,
knew that the Birthright did iustly belong to him,
by the preordination of God: therefore now wisely ta|keth
this opportunity to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> couer that to himselfe, wher|of
his brother was but an vsurper: For though <HI>Esau</HI>
could pleade the right of Nature, <HI>Iacob</HI> could the right
<PB N="9" REF="62">
of grace; and hee knew this would at last preuaile. Nei|ther
yet must this particular fact of <HI>Iacob</HI> be drawne in|to
a generall imitation. His warrant was a diuine reue|lation;
the silence whereof in these dayes sends vs for
direction to the written Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 8. 20</NOTE> <HI>To the Lawe, to the Te|stimonie:</HI>
let this resolue and instruct thee.</P>
<P>3. But this Birthright was a holy thing, and there|fore
the <HI>Apostle</HI> calles him a <HI>Profane person</HI> for selling it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 12. 16</NOTE>
Now there is no profanenesse in selling a thing not sa|cred.
But if sanctified things cannot bee solde without
sinne, can they be bought without sinne? Did not <HI>Ia|cob</HI>
offend as much in the one, as <HI>Esau</HI> in the other? It
is well answered, that <HI>Iacob intelligi potest suam redemisse
vexationem:</HI> he did but buy his owne vexation. He buies
not simply a thing, wherunto he had no right; but only
taketh this occasion to recouer his owne: whereof the
appointment of God had made him a possible, yea cer|tainely
future proprietary. It was neuer held Simonie,
for a spirituall man to buy his owne peace. Many things
are detained from the cleargie vniustly, which Gods
law hath made sacred and theirs: they may therefore
without touch of Simoniacall dealing, redeeme their
owne quietnesse, and purchase a peaceable possession.
I say not, that any man may buy a spirituall endow|ment
before hee hath it; but when he hath it in right,
he may purchase his owne peaceful and quiet enioying
it. All that can be said, is this: <HI>Esau</HI> preferred his belly
before his Birthright: <HI>Iacob</HI> his Birthright before his
belly. The one solde spirituall things for temporall,
the other with temporall things bought spirituall.</P>
<P>And who will not part with transient benefites for e|ternall
blessings? If eyther by suite, or strife, or pur|chase
we can attaine Heauen, wee are happy. For suite,
there is no houre vnseasonable, no prayer vnwelcome,
no importunitie troublesome. The vniust Iudge could
<PB N="10" REF="63">
giue reliefe to the importunate widow:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 18. 5.</NOTE> and shal not our
iust God giue eare and ease to our incessant plaints?
Spare to speake, and spare to speed: the timorous re|quester
teacheth the inuocated a deniall. For strife; we
know who taught vs, that <HI>the Kingdome of Heauen suf|fers
violence,</HI> and must bee attained by a holy kinde of
force. <HI>Iacob</HI> must wrastle for the Blessing before hee
hath it: and so wrastling hee shall haue it, though he
bee sent halting to his graue. The Lord knowes our
strength, yet hee loues our violence and importuni|tie:
and therefore hath so conditioned the gate of hea|uen,
that without our <HI>Striuing,</HI> we must not looke to
enter it. For purchase, had a farre higher rate beene
set on the Birthright, <HI>Iacob</HI> would not haue grudged to
giue it. He hath too much of the blood of <HI>Esau</HI> in him,
that will not forgoe all the world, rather then the Birth|right.
The wise Merchant, when hee knew the field
wherein lay that hidden treasure, solde all hee had to
buy it. Hee is a besotted <HI>Cosmopolite,</HI> that refuseth to
purchase such spirituall <HI>Friends</HI> by his riches, as may
procure him a place in the celestiall habitations.

<P>WHat hath secure <HI>Esau</HI> lost, if hauing solde the

could not but remember, that himselfe (though the
yoonger) was preferred to his elder brother <HI>Ishmael:</HI>
hee knew that Gods commaund preuailed with his Fa|ther
<HI>Abraham</HI> aboue nature, when hee bound him for
a sacrifice: he saw <HI>Esau</HI> lewdly matched with the daugh|ters
of Heathens: yet hee will now thinke on nothing,
but <HI>Esau is my first borne;</HI> and if it bee possible, hee will
poure the benediction vpon a wrong head.</P>
<P>But God is often better to vs then wee would; and
with his preuenting grace stoppes the precipitation of
erring nature. So sweete is the ordination of the Di|uine
prouidence, that we shall not doe what we would,
but what wee ought; and by deceiuing vs, turnes our
purposed euill into euentuall good. We are made to do
that good, which wee not intended. God hath ordai|ned
the superioritie to the yonger; hee will therefore
contriue for him the <HI>Blessing.</HI> Whatsoeuer <HI>Isaac</HI> affe|cted,

<P>To bring the Lords will to passe there neuer wanted
meanes. Sinnefull man may haue his hand in this: the

the death of his Sonne, without fauour to their guilt
that murderd him. The affections of Parents are heere

<P>The discourse or contemplation of the prouident
mother, and her happy sonnes passages in this action,
I finde set downe by so diuine and accurate a pen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. Hall Con|temp. volum. 1. libr. 3</NOTE> that
despairing of any tolerable imitation, I shall without
distaste to the Reader, or imputation to my selfe, deli|uer
it in his owne expresse words. <HI>Rebecca</HI> presuming
vpon the Oracle of God, and her husbands simplicity,
dares be <HI>Iacobs</HI> suretie for the danger, his counseller for
the carriage of the businesse, his cooke for the dyet;
yea dresses both the meate and the man. And now puts
dishes into his hand, words into his mouth, the gar|ments
on his backe, the goates haire vppon the open
parts of his body, and sends him in thus furnished for
the blessing. Standing no doubt at the doore, to see
how well her lesson was learned, how well her deuice
succeeded. And if olde <HI>Isaac</HI> should by any of his sen|ses
haue discerned the guile, shee had soone stept in,

<HI>Esaus</HI> tongue as well as his garments, that she might
securely deceiue all the senses of him, which had suffe|red
himselfe more dangerously deceiued with his affe|ction.
But this is past her remedy: her son must name
himselfe <HI>Esau</HI> with the voyce of <HI>Iacob.</HI></P>
<P>We see the proceeding: it is now examinable, whe|ther
this doth not somewhat impeach the credite of <HI>Ia|cobs
Plaine-Dealing.</HI> There haue beene vndertakers of
<HI>Iacobs</HI> iustification, or at least excusation in this fact.
Let vs heare what they say.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 6. in Ezek.</NOTE> 1. <HI>Gregorie</HI> thus excuseth
it: that <HI>Iahob</HI> did not steale the Blessing by fraud, but <HI>si|bi
debitam, accepit,</HI> tooke it as a due to himselfe, in re|spect
that the primogeniture was formerly deuolued to
him. The truth is, he that ought the <HI>Birthright,</HI> might
iustly chalenge the <HI>Blessing:</HI> but this doth not wholly
excuse the fact.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 53. in Genes.</NOTE> 2. <HI>Chrysostome</HI> thus mitigates it; that
<HI>non studio nocendi contexit fraudem,</HI> hee did not deceiue,
with a minde to hurt; but onely in respect of the pro|mise
of God. But this is not sufficient; for there was
an intention of hurt, both to <HI>Isaac</HI> in deceiuing him,
and to <HI>Esau,</HI> in depriuing him of the Blessing. But what|soeuer
may bee pleaded for the defence of <HI>Iacobs</HI> dissi|mulation
in outward gesture, there is no apologie for
the words of his tongue. The meaning of the speach
is in the speaker; therefore his tongue cannot be guilt|lesse,
when it goes against his conscious heart: but
the meaning of the gesture, is in the interpreter, who
giues it a voluntary construction. Gesture is more ea|sily
ruled then speach: and it is hard, if the tongue will
not blabbe what a man is, in spite of his habite. <HI>Isaacs</HI>
eyes might be deceiued, they were dimme: his hands,
by the roughnesse of the garments: his nosthrills by
<PB N="14" REF="65">
the smell of them: his palate, by the sauour of the meat.
All these senses yeeld affiance, what then shall driue <HI>I|saac</HI>
to a suspition or incredulitie? None but this, the
eare stickes at the iudgement; that sayes, <HI>the voyce is the
voyce of Iacob.</HI> To helpe forward this deceit, three lies
are tumbled out, one in the necke of another. 1. <HI>I am
Esau thy first borne. 2. I haue done as thou badst me. 3. eate
of my venison.</HI> To cleare him of this sinne of lying, hath
beene more peremptorily vndertaken, then soundly
performed.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Chrysostome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 5. in Genes.</NOTE> with diuers others, thinke that thogh
he did lie, hee did not sinne; because hee did it by the
reuelation and counsell of God. So that God willing
to haue the prediction fulfilled, dispensing and dispo|sing
all things, is brought in as the preordainer of <HI>Ia|cobs</HI>
lie, that I say not the Patron. But not without de|rogation
to his diuine Iustice. For first, it appeares not
that this was the counsell of God, but onely <HI>Rebeccaes</HI>
deuice, verse 8. <HI>Heare my voice my sonne, in that which I
commaund thee.</HI> My voice, not Gods; what I command,
not what GOD approoues. 2. If <HI>Iacob</HI> had receiued
any oraculous warrant for this proiect, hee would not
haue had so doubtfull an opinion of the successe.
The matter was forseene of God; not allowed: for
God neuer inspireth lies. Gods wise disposition of this
meanes, affords no warrant of his approbation. He or|dereth
many things, which hee ordayned not. The
means were so vnlawfull, that <HI>Iacob</HI> himselfe doth more
distrust their successe, then hope for their blessing. He
knew that good <HI>Isaac</HI> beeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>plaine</HI>-hearted himselfe,
would seuerely punish deceit in his sonne. Men in of|fice
truely honest, are the sorest enemies to fraudulent
courses in others. Hee therefore carries his meate in
trembling hands; and scarce dares hope, that God will
blesse such a subtletie with good euent. Yet he did; but
<PB N="15" REF="65">
how! Heere was prodigall dissembling: a dissembled
person, a dissembled name, dissembled venison, dis|sembling
answere; yet beholde a true blessing; to the
man, not to the meanes. Thus God may worke his
owne will out of our infirmities; yet without approuall
of our weakenesse, or wronging the integritie of his
owne goodnes.</P>
<P>2. Some haue confessed it a lie, but a guiltlesse he;
by reason of a necessitie imagined in this exigent; as if
GOD could not haue wrought <HI>Isaacs</HI> heart to blesse
<HI>Iacob</HI> in this short <HI>interim,</HI> whiles <HI>Esau</HI> was gone a hun|ting
for venison. <HI>Origen</HI> sayes, that <HI>Necessitie may vrge a
man to vse a lie, as sawce to his meate:</HI> Another; as Physi|cians
vse <HI>Hellebora.</HI> But that which is simply euill, can
by no apologie be made good. <HI>Causa patrocinio non bona,
peicr erit.</HI></P>
<P>3. Some take from it all imputation of alie, and
directly iustifie it. <HI>Augustine</HI> thinkes <HI>Iacob</HI> spoke my|stically,
and that it is to bee referred to <HI>Iacobs</HI> bodie,
not to <HI>Iacobs</HI> person; to the Christian Church that
should take away the Birthright from the elder. But
wee may better receiue, that <HI>Iacob</HI> fell into an infirmi|tie,
then the colour of an allegorie. Neyther doth
the successe iustifie the meanes. As some Philosophers
haue deliuered, that <HI>Prosperum, scelus vocatur virtus;</HI>
luckie wickednesse merites the name of goodnesse. But
<HI>Iacobs</HI> one act of falshoode, shall not disparage wholly
that simplicitie the Scripture giues him; <HI>Hee was a
plaine man.</HI> To bee vniust condemnes a man, not the
dooing of one singular act vniustly: therefore God
casts not off <HI>Iacob</HI> for this one infirmitie: but makes vse
of this infirmity to serue his owne purpose. If <HI>Esaus</HI>
and <HI>Iacobs</HI> workes bee weighed together in a ballance;
one would thinke the more solide vertue to bee in

<P>Yet then may <HI>Iacob</HI> stand for our precedent of <HI>Plaine-Dealing;</HI>
notwithstanding this particular weakenesse.
Who hath not oftener erred without the losse of his
honest reputation? Not that his fact should embolden
an imitation: let vs not tell <HI>Iacobs</HI> lie, to get <HI>Iacobs</HI> bles|sing.
It would be presumption in vs, what was in him
infirmity: and God that pardond his weaknesse, would
curse our obstinatenesse. There is yet one cauill more

<HEAD>Laban,</HEAD>
<P>ABout the parti-coloured sheepe; whether it were a
fault in <HI>Iacob,</HI> by the deuice of the pilled and stra|ked
roddes to enrich himselfe. The answere is three|folde.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="66">
1. This was by the direction of God, <HI>Genesis</HI> 31. 11.
who being an infinite and illimited Lord, hath an ab|solute
power to transferre the right of things from one
to another: as he might iustly giue the Land of <HI>Cana|an</HI>
to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> from the vsurping <HI>Cananites.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Iacob</HI> apprehends this meanes to recouer his
owne; due vnto him by a double right: first, as the
wages of twenty yeares seruice, <HI>Genesis</HI> 31. 7. yet vn|payd.
Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 31. 15</NOTE> as the dowry for his wiues; whom mi|serable
<HI>Laban</HI> had thrust vppon him without any com|petent
portion. Thirdly, especially Gods warrant con|curring;
it was lawfull for him to recouer that by poli|cie,
which was detained from him by iniury. So did the
<HI>Israelites</HI> borrow of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> their best goods, ie|wells,
and ornaments; and bore them away as a iust re|compence
of their long seruice.</P>
<P>3. Lastly, hee is quitted by that saying, <HI>Volenti non
fit iniuria. Laban</HI> sees that hee was well blessed by <HI>Iacobs</HI>
seruice: the encreasing his flockes makes him loath to
part. But <HI>Iacob</HI> hath serued long enough for a dead
pay; somewhat hee must haue, or be gone. His hard
vnckle biddes him aske a hire: you know <HI>Iacobs</HI> de|maund:
<HI>Laban</HI> readily promoues this bargaine; which
at last made his sonne in law rich, and himselfe enuious.
So sayth <HI>Caluine, Tractatus est prosuo ingenio; Laban</HI> is
handled in his kinde. Hee thought by this meanes, to
haue multiplyed his owne flockes: but those few spot|ted
sheepe and goates, vpon this couenant, as if they
had beene weary of their olde owner, alter their fashi|on,
and runne their best yoong into party-colours;
changing at once their colour, and their maister. So
that this meanes, which <HI>Iacob</HI> vsed, was not fraudu|lent
or artificiall, but naturall; not depending vpon
mans witte, but Gods blessing: who considering his
tedious and painfull seruice, payes him good wages out
<PB N="18" REF="67">
of his vnckles foldes. For foureteene yeares the Lord
hath for <HI>Iacob</HI> enriched <HI>Laban:</HI> therefore for these last
six he will out of <HI>Laban</HI> enrich <HI>Iacob.</HI> And if the vnckles
flocke be the greater, the nephews shall be the better.
Most iustly then is <HI>Iacob</HI> cleared from iniustice; and no
aspersion of fraud with <HI>Laban</HI> can be cast to discredite
his <HI>Plaine-Dealing.</HI></P>

When wee haue fortified, combined, feasted, death

depart with griefe, from Orchards full of fruits, grounds
full stocked, houses dightly furnished, purses richly

you must goe, euery man to his owne home. Hee that

glasse of the Scripture, slippes off his coate with <HI>Ioseph,</HI>
and springs away. They that liued thrice our age, yet
dwelt in <HI>Tents;</HI> as Pilgrims that did not owne this
world. The shortnesse and weakenesse of our dayes,
strengthens our reasons to vilipend it. The world is the
field, thy body the <HI>Tent,</HI> heauen thy free-holde. The
world is full of troubles; windes of persecutions, storms
of menaces, cold of vncharitablenesse, heate of malice,
exhalations of prodigious terrours, will annoy thee.

wee might not sucke too long on it. Satan, as some doe
with rotten nutmegs, guildes it ouer, and sends it his
friends for a token. But when they put that spice into

Heere is no ambition of great buildings; a <HI>Tent</HI> will

serue. How differ our dayes and hearts from those!
The fashion is now, to build great houses to our lands,
till wee leaue no lands to our houses: and the credite of
a good house, is made, not to consist in inward hospi|tality,
but in outward walls. These punkish out-sides
beguile the needy Traueller: hee thinkes, there cannot
be so many roomes in a house, and neuer a one to har|bour
a poore stranger: or that from such a multitude of
chimneis, no meate should be sent to the gates. Such a
house is like a painted whoore: it hath a faire cheek, but
rotten lungs; no breath of charity comes out of it. We
say, <HI>frustra fit per plura, quod fieri potest per pauciora.</HI> What
needes a house more roomes, then there is vse for? A
lesse house, and more hospitablenesse would doe a great

set vp in the curse of <HI>Iericho:</HI> the foundation laid in the

This was one of the Trauellers obserued faults in

<PB N="21" REF="68">
If the tongue be an ill seruant to the heart, the
heart will be an ill maister to the tongue; and Satan to
both. There are three kindes of dissimulation held to|lerable,
if not commendable: and beyond them, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
without sinne.</P>
<P>1.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">1. Sam 21</NOTE> When a man dissembles to get himselfe out of

fained himselfe madde, to escape with life. So the good
Physician may deceiue his patient, by stealing vppon
him a potion which he abhorreth, intending his reco|uerie.</P>
<P>2. When dissimulation is directly aymed to the in|struction
and benefite of another. So <HI>Ioseph</HI> caused the
money to bee put in his brethrens sackes, thereby to
worke in them a knowledge of themselues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 24</NOTE> So <HI>Christ</HI>
going to <HI>Emaus</HI> with the two <HI>Disciples, made as if he would

<P>3. When some common seruice is thereby perfor|med
to the good of the Church. Such are those strata|gems
and policies of warre, that carry in them a direct
intention of honesty and iustice, though of hostillity; as
<HI>Iosuah's,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioshua 8</NOTE> whereby he discomfited the men of <HI>Ai.</HI></P>
<P>Further then these limits no true <HI>Israelite,</HI> no <HI>Plaine-Dealing</HI>

must needes be contrary to the rule of grace, for it is
contrary to the order of nature: which hath giuen a
man voyce and words to expresse the meaning of the
heart. As in setting Instruments, they referre all to one
tune: so the heart is the ground, which all our Instru|ments
should goe by. If there were no God to search

<HEAD>In Demeaning,</HEAD>
<P>WHich is the good harmony betwixt the tongue
and the hand. The righteous man, to whom
Gods celestiall Tabernacle is promised, <HI>speaketh the
truth in his heart:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 15. 4</NOTE> and when he hath <HI>sworne,</HI> though to
his <HI>owne hurt, he changeth not.</HI> The paucitie of these men
makes the Church of God so thinne of Saints, and the
world so full of Dissemblers. As the tongue must not
speake false, so the hand must not doe vniustly: iniu|stice
is the greatest dissimulation. We liue vnder <HI>Libra,</HI>
Iustice and Equitie: who knowes whether the nights
or the daies passe ouer his head more happily: we feare

not <HI>Taurus</HI> the Bull, that shoots his hornes from <HI>Rome:</HI>

enemies to engine and batter our walls: if the <HI>Sagit|tarius</HI>
of heresie do not wound vs in the reines: nor the
<HI>Gemini</HI> of double-dealing circumuent vs in our liues.
The world is full of trickes: wee will not doe what wee
ought, yet defend what we doe. How many spend their
wittes to iustifie their hands? Through the vnluckie
and vnnaturall copulation of fraud and malice, was that
monstrous stigmatike <HI>Aequiuocation</HI> ingendred: a dam|ned
egge, not couerd by any faire bird; but hatched, as
Poets faine, of Osprayes, with a thunder-clap.</P>
<P>I will now onely seeke to winne you to <HI>Plaine-Dea|ling,</HI>
by the benefites it brings: the successe to God.</P>
<P>1. The principall is to please God; whose displea|sure
against double dealing, the sad examples of <HI>Saul</HI>
for the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> of <HI>Gehezi</HI> for the bribes, of <HI>Ananias</HI>
for the inheritance, testifie in their destruction. Whose
delight in <HI>Plaine-dealing</HI> himselfe affirmes. <HI>Behold an Is|raelite
indeed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 1. 17</NOTE> in whom is no guile.</HI></P>
<P>2. The credite of a good name, which is a most wor|thy
treasure, is thus preserued. The riches left thee by
thy Ancestors may miscarry throgh others negligence;
the name not, saue by thy owne fault. It is the <HI>Plaine-dealers</HI>
reward; his name shall bee had in estimation:
whereas no faith is giuen to the dissembler; euen spea|king
truth: euery man is more ready to trust the poore
<HI>Plaine-dealer,</HI> then the glittering false-tongued gallant.</P>
<P>3. It preuents and infatuates all the malicious plotts
of enemies. God, in regard to thy simplicitie, brings
to naught all their machinations. <HI>Thou, O Lord, hadst
respect to my simple purenesse.</HI> An innocent foole takes
fearelesse steps; and walkes as securely, as if it stood girt
with a wall of brasse.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="70">
4. It preserues thy state from ruine. When by sub|tiltie
men thinke to scrape together much wealth; all is
but the Spiders web, artificiall and weake. What <HI>Plaine-dealing</HI>
gets, stickes by vs; and infallibly deriues it selfe
to our posterity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 25. 13</NOTE> Not onely this mans <HI>owne soule shall
dwell at ease:</HI> but also <HI>his seed shall inherite the earth.</HI> Wic|ked
men labour with hands and wittes, to vndermine
and vndoe many poore; and from their demolished
heapes to erect themselues a great fortune: but GOD
bloweth vpon it a <HI>Nonplacet:</HI> and then, as powder doth
small shot, it scatters into the ayre, not without a great
noise; and they are blowne vp. If thou wouldst be good
to thy selfe and thine, vse <HI>Plainesse.</HI></P>
<P>5. It shall somewhat keepe thee from the troubles
and vexations of the world. Others, when their double
dealing breaks out, are more troubled themselues, then
erst they troubled others: for shame waits at the heeles
of fraud.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> But <HI>blessed are the meeke, for they shall inherite the
earth.</HI></P>
<P>6. The curses of the poore shall neuer hurt thee.
Though <HI>the causlesse curse shall neuer come;</HI> yet it is hap|py
for a man so to liue, that all may blesse him. Now
the <HI>Plaine</HI> man shall haue this at last. Gallant prodiga|litie,
like fire in flaxe, makes a great blaze, a hote shew:
but <HI>Plaine</HI> hospitality, like fire in solide wood, holds out
to warme the poore: because God blesseth it. So I haue
seene hote-spurres in the way gallop amaine; but the I|uy-bushes
haue so staied them, that the <HI>Plaine</HI> traueller
comes first to his iournies end.</P>
<P>7. It shall bee thy best comfort on thy death-bed;
<HI>Conscientia ben&egrave; peractae vitae,</HI> the conscience of an inno|cent
life. On this staffe leanes aged <HI>Samuel: Whose Oxe
er Asse haue I taken?</HI> To whom haue I by fraud or force
done wrong? On this pillow doth sicke <HI>Hezekiah</HI> lay
his head.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 38. 3</NOTE> <HI>Remember Lord, that I haue walked before thee
<PB N="25" REF="70">
in truth, and with a perfect heart, and haue done that which is
good in thy sight.</HI> So <HI>Iob</HI> solaceth himselfe. <HI>My heart shall
not condemne me for my dayes.</HI> When no clogges of vsury
with their heauy pressures, nor foldes of iniustice with
their troublesome vexations, disquiet our peace-desi|ring
sides, or lie vpon our consciences. When thou
hast no need to say to thine heire, Restore this or that
which I haue fraudulently or vniustly taken away. You
see how false the Prouerbe was; Plaine-dealing is a Ie|well;
and hee that vseth it shall die a begger: But it is
well returned in the supplement; he that will not vse it,
shall die a dishonest man.</P>
<P>8. Lastly, thou shalt finderest for thy soule. Thou
hast dealt plainely, so will God with thee; multiplying
vpon thee his promised mercies. If thou hadst beene
hollow, not holy; fraudulent, not plaine; thy por|tion
had beene bitter; euen <HI>with hypocrites.</HI>
But now of a <HI>plaine</HI> Saint on earth,
thou shalt become a glorious
Saint in heauen.</P>

<P>_WHen those three Goddesses, say the Po|ets,
stroue for the golden ball, <HI>Paris</HI> ad|iudged

are three celestiall graces, in an holy e|mulation,
if I may so speake, striuing
for the chiefedome; and our <HI>Apostle</HI>
giues it to <HI>Loue. The greatest of these is Charity.</HI></P>
<P>Not that other Daughters are blacke, but that <HI>Cha|rity</HI>
excels in beauty. Wee may say of this Sister, as
it was sayd of the good Woman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 31. 29.</NOTE> <HI>Prou. 31. Many
daughters haue done vertuously, but thou surpassest them all.
Paul</HI> doth not disparage any, when he sayth, <HI>Charity is
the greatest.</HI> All starres are bright, though <HI>one starre</HI> may
<HI>differ from another in glory.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15.</NOTE> Wee may say of graces, as
<PB N="2" REF="73">
of the Captaines of the sonnes of <HI>Gad; the least can
resist a hundred, the greatest a thousand.</HI> Or as the song
was of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Dauid. Saul hath slaine his thousand, Da|uid
his ten thousand. Faith</HI> is excellent, so is <HI>Hope;</HI> but
<HI>the greatest of these, is Charitie.</HI></P>
<P>Mee thinkes these three Theologall Vertues may
not vnfitly bee compared to three great Feastes, which
wee celebrate in the yeare; Easter, Whitsuntide, and
Christmas. <HI>Faith,</HI> like Easter, beleeues <HI>Christ dead for
our sinnes, and risen againe for our Iustification. Hope,</HI> like
Pentecost, waites for the comming of the holy Ghost,
Gods free Spirit of grace to come into vs, and to bring
vs to Heauen. And <HI>Charitie</HI> lookes like Christmas,
full of loue to our neighbours, full of hospitality, and
mercy to the poore.</P>
<P>These are three strings often touched; <HI>Faith,</HI> where|by
wee beleeue all Gods promises to bee true, and
ours: <HI>Hope,</HI> whereby we waite for them with patience:
<HI>Charitie,</HI> whereby vee testifie, what wee beleeue and
hope. Hee that hath <HI>faith</HI> cannot distrust: hee that
hath <HI>hope,</HI> cannot bee put from anchor: he that hath
<HI>charity,</HI> will not lead a licentious life; for, <HI>Loue keepes
the commandements.</HI></P>
<P>For Methods sake, wee might first conferre them
all, then preferre one. But I will speake of them ac|cording
to the three degrees of comparison. 1. Posi|tiuely.
2. Comparatiuely. 3. Superlatiuely. <HI>The
greatest of these is Charitie.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Faith</HEAD>
<P>IS that grace, which makes Christ ours, and all his

Now the Metaphore may be extended thus.</P>
<P>1. Christ dying, made a Will or a Testament, sca|ling
<PB N="4" REF="74">
it with his owne bloud, wherein hee bequeathed a

himselfe. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 17.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 17. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Father, I will that they whom thou hast

of his Will and <HI>Testament.</HI></P>
<P>2 The Conueyance of this Will is the Gospell, <HI>Who|soeuer
beleeues, and is baptized, shall bee saued.</HI> A large
Patent, a free and full grant. There is no exception of
persons; eyther in regard of state, quality, or Country.

is of an ample latitude.</P>
<P>3. The Executor or Administrator of this Will,
if I may so speake, is the holy <HI>Ghost:</HI> that <HI>Comforter</HI>
which Christ promised to <HI>send,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 14. 16.</NOTE> <HI>that should lead vs into
all truth.</HI> This <HI>Spirit</HI> begets faith &amp; sanctification in

vs vp to the day of redemption.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 30.</NOTE> Without his assistance
wee could appropriate no comfort by his Will; nor
challenge any Legacie therein bequeathed.</P>
<P>4. Lastly, the <HI>Euidence,</HI> whereby euery particular
man apportions to himselfe this title and interest, is his
<HI>Faith.</HI> Thou vnregenerate soule pleadest a Legacie in
this Will: Goe to, let vs ioyne issue, &amp; come to try|al.
Where is thy <HI>Euidence?</HI> Here it is, my <HI>Faith.</HI> This
<HI>Euidence,</HI> as all other, must haue some witnesses: pro|duce
thine; and before the Barre of the great Chiefe
Iustice, the Kings Bench of Heauen, let them not
lie.</P>
<P>The first is thy <HI>Conscience.</HI> Alas! giue this
leaue to speake without interruption (and one day it

<HI>riches,</HI> or in certainely bad vanities, more then in the li|uing
God.</P>
<P>The next, is thy <HI>life.</HI> Alas! this is so speckled
with sinnes, so raw and sore with lusts: that as a body
broken out into blaines and biles, argues a corrupted
liuer or stomacke within: so the spottes and vlcers of
thy life demonstrate a putrified heart. Loe now thy wit|nesses.
Thou art gone at the common Law of Iustice:
It is onely the Chancerie of mercy that must cleare
thee. What wilt thou now doe? What, but humble
thy selfe in repentance for thy false faith; take prayer
in thy company, for pardon of former errors; goe by
the word preached; for the Minister is, as it were, the
Register, to ingrosse the deed; and desire God on the
humbled knees of thy soule, to giue thee a new and a
true <HI>Euidence.</HI> Let this instruct vs to some vses.</P>
<P>1. Be sure that thy <HI>Euidence</HI> is good. <HI>Satan</HI> is a sub|till
Lawyer, (and thou doest not doubt of his ma|lice)
and will soone picke holes in it; find out tricks

for want of faith. Glorious is the inheri|tance,
but where is thy <HI>Euidence?</HI> Flatter not thy soule
with hope of this possession, without the assurance of
<HI>faith. Christ giues his life for his sheepe:</HI> What is this to
thee that art a Wolfe, a Swine, a Goate? God dres|seth
his Vineyard, pruneth it, watereth it, is prouident
ouer it: What's this to thee, that art a thorne, and
no branch of the Vine? Looke thou to be weeded vp,
and throwne out. The bloud of Christ runnes fresh:
but where is thy pipe of <HI>faith,</HI> to deriue it from his
side to thy conscience? Say, it should showre mercy,
yet if thou wantest <HI>faith,</HI> all would fall besides thee.
There would be no more fauour for thee, then if there
was no Sauiour.</P>
<P>Let then no miseries of earth, much lesse pleasures,
quench thy <HI>faith.</HI> Satan seeing this sparke of fire kin|dled
in thy heart, would blow it out with stormes, or
worke thee to smother it thy selfe with vanities, or to
rake it vp in the dead embers of cold security: but be|leeue
against sight and sense. As <HI>Dauid</HI> prophesied,
that hee should be a King. <HI>Eo plus habet fides meriti, quo

<P>Though misery be present, comfort absent, though

<P>These are the comforts of <HI>Hope.</HI> Now, that you may
not bee deceyued, there is (as I sayde before of <HI>Faith</HI>) a
thing like <HI>Hope,</HI> which is not it.</P>
<P>There is a bold and presumptuous <HI>Hope,</HI> an igno|rant
security, and vngrounded perswasion, the very il|lusion
of the Diuell; who, when hee cannot preuaile
with downe-right euill, cozens with the shadowes of
goodnesse: that how wickedly and wretchedly soeuer
a man shall liue, though hee sucke the poisonous dugs
of lust, though hee surres himselfe warme with
poore mens hearts, though hee forbids his braines (as
on couenant) one sober houre in the yeaae to thinke
of heauen, though hee thirst for carowses of bloud,
though he striues to powder a whole Kingdome with
the cornes of death and massacre, though hee carries
halfe a dozen impropriate Churches on his sacrilegi|ous
backe, though hee out-thunder heauen with blas|phemies,
though hee trample vnder his profane foote
the precious bloud of Gods sonne; yet still hee hopes
to bee saued by the mercy of God. But wee will soo|ner
cast pearles to swine, and bread to dogges, then the
comforts of <HI>Sion</HI> to such. Wee say not, <HI>Reioyce &amp; trem|ble,</HI>
but tremble without reioycing. Wee sing not to
them, <HI>with the Lord is mercy, that hee might bee feared:</HI>
but with the <HI>Lord</HI> is iudgement and vengeance, with
<PB N="9" REF="76">
him is plague and pestilence, storme and tempest, hor|rour

bee feared. Against this <HI>Hope,</HI> wee shut vp the bosome

<P>There is an <HI>Hope,</HI> sober, faithfull, well grounded,
well guarded, well assured. This is like a house built on

<HI>Hope</HI> in Christ: it is (as it were) moted or in|trenched

<HEAD>Charitie</HEAD>
<P>IS an excellent vertue, and therefore rare: if euer in
this contentious age; wherein <HI>Fratrum quo&abque; gratia

is mee; before I am come to define what loue is, I
am falne into a declamation against the want of it: what

as if wee had no need of mutuall succour; nor could

<P><PB N="10" REF="77">
The proper and immediate obiect of our <HI>Loue,</HI> is
God. This is the great Commandement, <HI>Thou shalt

with all thy strength.</HI> As if hee would not leaue out the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">east sinew or string of the heart, the least faculty or
power of the soule, the least organ or action of the
strength. So <HI>Bern. With all the heart,</HI> that is, affec|tionately.
<HI>With all the Soule,</HI> that is, wisely. <HI>With all

it. All the affection of the <HI>heart,</HI> all the election of the
<HI>soule,</HI> all the administration of the <HI>body.</HI> The <HI>Soule</HI>
iudgeth, the <HI>Will</HI> prosecutes, the <HI>strength</HI> executes.
God can brooke no riualles: no diuision betwixt him
and <HI>Mammon,</HI> betwixt him and <HI>Melchom,</HI> betwixt
him and <HI>Baal,</HI> betwixt him and <HI>Belial. Causa dilige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|di

<HI>Minus amatte, qui aliquid amat praeterte, quod non

thing besides him, which hee doth not loue for
him.</P>
<P>The subordinate obiect of loue, is man: and his
loue, is the effect of the former cause; and an actuall
demonstration of the other inward affection. Waters
comming from the sea, boyle through the veines of the
earth, till they become springs, and those springs ri|uers,
and those riuers runne backe to the sea againe.
All mans loue must be carried in the streame of Gods

cease.</P>
<P>Thus for the first degree of compariion, <HI>Positiuely.</HI>
The second is <HI>Comparatiue;</HI> where, though it be sayd,
Vertues and great men must not bee compared, yet we
may without offence, bring them to a holy conference;
els how shall wee perceyue the <HI>Apostles</HI> intended scope,
the transcendency of <HI>Charity?</HI> I will therefore first con|ferre
<HI>Faith</HI> with <HI>Hope;</HI> and then with them both
<HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P>The distinction betweene <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> is nice,
and must warily bee discouered. I will reduce the dif|ferences
into three respects, of <HI>Order, Office,</HI> and
<HI>Obiect.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Order, Paul</HI> giues <HI>Faith</HI> the precedencie.
<HI>Hebr. 11. Faith is the ground of things hoped for. Faith</HI> al|wayes
goes before, <HI>Hope</HI> followes after; and may in
some sort bee sayde to bee the daughter of <HI>Faith.</HI>
For, it is as impossible for a man to <HI>Hope</HI> for that
which hee beleeues not, as for a Painter to drawe a
picture in the ayre. Indeed, more is beleeued then is
hoped for; but nothing is hoped for, which is not
beleeued. So that on necessity, in respect of order,
<PB N="12" REF="78">
<HI>Faith</HI> must precede <HI>Hope.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Office; Faith</HI> is the Christians Logicke, <HI>Hope</HI>
his Rhetorike. <HI>Faith</HI> perceiues what is to bee done,
<HI>Hope</HI> giues alacritie to the doing it. <HI>Faith</HI> guides, ad|viseth,
rectifieth; <HI>Hope</HI> couragiously encounters with
all adversaries. Therefore <HI>Faith</HI> is compared to a
Doctor in the Schooles, <HI>Hope</HI> to a Captaine in the
warres. <HI>Faith</HI> discernes the truth, <HI>Hope</HI> fights against
impatience, heauinesse of Spirit, infirmitie, deiected|nesse,
desperation. Divines haue alluded the diffe|rence
betweene <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> in Divinity, to that be|tweene
wisedome and valour in Philosophie. Valour
without wisedome, is rashnesse: wisedome without va|lour,
is cowardice. <HI>Faith</HI> without <HI>Hope,</HI> is knowledge
without valour to resist Sathan: <HI>Hope</HI> without <HI>Faith,</HI> is
rash presumption, and an vndiscreet daring. You see
their different <HI>Office.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Obiect; Faithes</HI> object is the absolute word,
and infallible promise of God; <HI>Hopes</HI> obiect, is the
thing promised. <HI>Fides intuetur verbum rei, Spes ver&ograve; rem
verbi: Faith</HI> lookes to the word of the thing, <HI>Hope</HI> to
the thing of the word. So that <HI>Faith</HI> hath for the ob|iect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alsted Syste~. Theolog. lib. 3. Loc. 17. Aug.</NOTE>
the <HI>Truth</HI> of God, <HI>Hope</HI> the <HI>Goodn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sse</HI> of God. <HI>Faith</HI>
is of things both good and bad, <HI>Hope</HI> of good things
onely. A man beleeues there is a hell, as truely as he
beleeues there is a heaven; but he feares the one, and
<HI>hopes</HI> onely for the other. <HI>Faith</HI> hath obiected to it
things past, present, future. Past, it beleeues Christ
dead for our sinnes, and risen againe for our Iustifica|tion.
Present, that hee now sits at the right hand of
his Father in heauen. Future, that hee shall come to
iudge quicke and dead. <HI>Hope,</HI> onely respects and ex|pects
things to come. For a man cannot <HI>hope</HI> for
that which hee hath. You see how in some sense, <HI>Hope</HI>
excels <HI>Faith.</HI> For, there is a faith in the Deuils; they
<PB N="13" REF="78">
beleeue the truth of God, the certainety of the Scrip|tures,
they acknowledge Christ the Iudge of quicke
and dead, therefore cry, <HI>Why tormentest thou vs before
the time?</HI> They haue <HI>faith</HI> ioyned with a Popish pre|paratory
good worke, <HI>Feare;</HI> the Deuils <HI>beleeue and
tremble:</HI> yea, they pray: they beseech Christ not to
send them into the deepes; what then want they? <HI>Hope,</HI>
a confident expectation of the mercy of God: this
they can neuer haue. They beleeue, they cannot hope.
This is the life of Christians, and the want makes De|vils.
If it were not for <HI>this hope,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 19.</NOTE> <HI>wee of all&punc; men were most
miserable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Charity,</HI> differs from them both. These three di|vine
graces, are a created Trinity; and haue some
glimmering resemblance of the Trinity vncreate. For,
as there, the Sonne is begotten of the Father, and the
holy Ghost proceedes from them both: so heere, a
true <HI>faith</HI> begets a constant <HI>hope,</HI> and from them pro|ceedes
<HI>Charity.</HI> Thus is Gods Temple built in our
hearts, sayth <HI>August.</HI> The foundation whereof is
<HI>Faith, Hope</HI> the erection of the wals, <HI>Charity</HI> the per|fection
of the roofe.</P>
<P>In the godly all these three are vnited together, &amp;
cannot bee sundred. Wee <HI>beleeue</HI> in Gods mercy, wee
<HI>hope</HI> for his mercy, and we <HI>loue</HI> him for his mercy. <HI>Faith</HI>
sayes, there are good things prepared: <HI>Hope</HI> sayes, they
are prepared for me: <HI>Charity</HI> sayes, I endevour to walke
worthy of them. So that, what good <HI>Faith</HI> beleeues,
shall bee, <HI>Hope</HI> expects for her selfe, and <HI>Charity</HI> aymes
at the way to get it, by <HI>keeping the commandements. Faith</HI>
apprehends both reward and punishment: <HI>Hope</HI> onely
lookes for good things for our selues: <HI>Charity</HI> desires
the glory of God, and the good of all our Bre|thren.</P>
<P>The second degree, giues way to the third, last,
<PB N="14" REF="79">
best; the <HI>Superlatiue. But the greatest of these is Cha|rity.</HI>
Time will not afforde mee to answere all the ob|iections,
which subtill wits haue inconsequently dedu|ced
from these words. Neyther were it to other pur|pose,
then to write <HI>Iliades</HI> after <HI>Homer:</HI> they haue been
so soundly and satisfyingly answered already. I will on|ly
mention two, and but report a responsiue So|lution.</P>
<P>1 The principall promises are made to beleeuers.
<HI>Whosoeuer beleeues, and is baptized, shall bee saued.</HI> So
no lesse a promise is made to <HI>Louers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 28.</NOTE> Rom. 8. <HI>All things

he is <HI>within those that loue him.</HI> Heere is <HI>Prope, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uxta, In|tus.</HI>
This same <HI>Intra, within</HI> is of the highest degree.

in God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 4. 17.</NOTE> <HI>and God in him.</HI> O vnspeakable fe|licity!</P>
<P>2 If <HI>Charity</HI> be greater then <HI>faith,</HI> then is not man
iustified by faith onely. Inconsequent illation. Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> commends not <HI>loue</HI> for the vertue of Iustificati|on:
it may fayle in that particular action, yet receiue
no impeachment to the excellency of it. By demonstra|tion.
A Prince doth excell a peasant: shall any man
therefore inferre, that hee can plow better, or haue
more skill in tillage. A Philosopher doth excell a Me|chanicke;
though he cannot grinde so well as a Miller,
or lim so cunningly as a Painter. A man is better then
a beast: who but a mad-man will therefore conclude,
that hee can runne faster then a horse, draw more then
an oxe, or carry a greater burden then an Elephant.
Though he fayle in these particular arts, yet none will
deny, but hee is better then a beast.</P>
<P>The truth is, that in <HI>F&agrave;ith</HI> stands originally our fel|lowship
<PB N="15" REF="79">
with God. Into that hand he powreth the ri|ches
of his mercy for salvation: and were the actions
of <HI>Charity</HI> neuer so great, and (foolishly thought) meri|torious;
yet, if not the effects of a true sauing <HI>Faith,</HI>
they are lost, and a man may for his <HI>Charitie</HI> goe to the
Deuill. And though they would plead from the forme
of the last iudgement, <HI>Math.</HI> 25. that God accepts men
to life for their deeds of <HI>Charitie:</HI> feeding, clothing, re|leeuing.
Yet the Scripture fully testifies, that God nei|ther
accepts these, nor our selues for these, further then
they are the effects of a true <HI>faith.</HI> Our persons being
first iustified by faith in Christ, then God will crowne
our works. Yet a Christian must worke: for no nudifidi|an,
so well as no nullifidian, shall be admitted into hea|uen.
Therefore sayth the <HI>Apostle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Faith worketh by loue.</HI>
For <HI>Faith</HI> is able to iustifie of it selfe, not to vorke of it
selfe. The hand alone can receiue an Almes: but can|not
cut a peece of wood without an axe or some instru|ment.
<HI>Faith</HI> is the Christians hand, and can without
helpe receyue Gods giuen grace into the heart: but to
produce the fruits of obedience, and to vorke the actu|all
duties required, it must haue an inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ument; adde
<HI>Loue</HI> to it, and it <HI>worketh</HI> by <HI>loue.</HI> So that the one is our
Iustification before God, and the other our Testifica|tion
before men. Wherein then consists this high tran|scendency
of <HI>Charity?</HI> In two priviledges, incommuni|cable
to <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope; Latitude</HI> and <HI>Perpetuity.</HI></P>
<P>1. For Latitude, <HI>Loue</HI> is the <HI>greatest. Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI>
are restrayned within the limits of our particular per|sons.
<HI>The iust man liues by his owne faith:</HI> and hopes good
to himselfe; but <HI>Loue</HI> is like the <HI>Vine,</HI> which <HI>God brought
out of Egypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 80. 8.</NOTE> <HI>and cast out the heathen to plant it, which coue|reth
the mountaines with the shadow of the boughes, &amp; spreads
the branches vnto the sea and the riuers:</HI> It is like
the Sunne in the skie, that throwes his comfortable
<PB N="16" REF="80">
beames vpon all; and forbeares not to warme euen
that earth that beareth weeds. <HI>Loue</HI> extends to earth &amp;
heauen. In heauen it affecteth God the Maker and mo|ver:
the Angels, as our Guardians; the triumphant
Saints, for their pious sanctitie. On earth, it imbraceth
those that feare the Lord especially: it wisheth conver|sion
to those that do not: it counsels the rich: it com|forts
the poore: it reverenceth superiors, respecteth in|feriors:
doth good to friends, no evill to foes: wisheth
well to all. This is the latitude of <HI>Charity.</HI> The pro|perty
of <HI>faith,</HI> is to receyue into it selfe: the property of
<HI>loue,</HI> to lay out it selfe to others. So that <HI>faith</HI> hath but
narrow limits, but the extent of <HI>Loue</HI> is vniversall, not
bounded with the world. <HI>Faith</HI> beleeues for thy selfe,
but <HI>Charity</HI> deriues, &amp; driues the effects of <HI>thy faith</HI> to
others. <HI>Thy faith</HI> relieues thy self, thy <HI>charity</HI> thy brother.</P>
<P>2. For perpetvity and continuance. <HI>Faith</HI> laies hold
on Gods gracious promise for everlasting salvation:
<HI>Hope</HI> expects this with patience: but when God shal ful|fil
his word, &amp; vs with ioy, then <HI>Faith</HI> shall be at an end:
<HI>hope</HI> at an end: but <HI>Loue</HI> shal remain between God &amp; vs,
an everlasting bond. Therefore sayth the Apostle,
<HI>Now abideth faith, &amp;c. Now.</HI> Now three, then one: and
that is <HI>Charity.</HI> When wee haue possession of those
pleasures, which we hoped and beleeued, what longer
vse is there of <HI>Faith</HI> or <HI>Hope?</HI> But our loues shall not
end with our liues. Wee shall euerlastingly <HI>loue</HI> our
our Maker, Saviour, Sanctifier, Angels, &amp; Saints; where
no discontent shall breed any iarre in our <HI>Halleluiahs.</HI> If
the vse of loue bee so comfortable on earth, what may
wee thinke it will be in heaven!</P>
<P>Thus sayth <HI>Chrysost: Onely loue is eternall.</HI> Now
<HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> hold vp the hands of <HI>Charity,</HI> as <HI>Aa|ron</HI>
and <HI>Hur</HI> helde vp the hands of <HI>Moses:</HI> but then
their vse and office shall cease. <HI>Tunc non erit spes, quando
<PB N="17" REF="80">
erit spes. Hope</HI> shall not bee, when the thing <HI>hoped</HI> is.
<HI>Hope</HI> shall bring in possession, possession shall thrust
out <HI>Hope.</HI> Therefore sayth <HI>Augustine,</HI> is <HI>Charity grea|ter;
Et si non propter eminentiam, tamen propter permanenti|am;</HI>
If not for the excellency, yet for the perpetuity.</P>
<P>Thus to iustifie a man, <HI>Faith</HI> is greater, but in a man
iustified, <HI>Charity</HI> is greater. Let <HI>Faith</HI> alone with the
great worke of our salvation: but that finished, it shall
end, &amp; so yeeld superiority to <HI>Loue,</HI> which shall endure
for euer.</P>
<P>Thus you haue commended to your soules these
three sisters, <HI>Faith, Hope,</HI> and <HI>Charity. Faith</HI> wee must
haue, or we are reprobates; <HI>Hope,</HI> or wretches, <HI>Charity,</HI>
or not Christians. There is a promise made to <HI>Faith,</HI>
that it shall haue accesse to God. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 6.</NOTE> To <HI>Hope,</HI> that
it shall not be <HI>ashamed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro. 5. 5</NOTE> <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. But to <HI>Charity,</HI> that it

<P>I should now tell you, that as these three fayre Si|sters
come downe from heaven; so in a crosse con|trariety,
the Devill sends vp three foule fiends from
hell. Against <HI>Faith, Infidelity:</HI> against <HI>Hope, Despera|tion:</HI>

<HEAD>THE
TAMING OF
the Tongue.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>IAM. 3. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>But the tongue can no man tame: it is an
vnruly euill, full of deadly poyson.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_HEre is a single Position, guarded with a
double reason. The Position is, <HI>No
man can tame the Tongue.</HI> The Reasons,
1. <HI>It is vnruly. 2. Full of deadly poyson.</HI>
Heere is busie dealing with a wilde
member: a more difficult action, and
intractable nature could not haue met. <HI>Tongue</HI> is the
Subiect (I meane in the discourse;) and can you euer
thinke of subiecting it naturally to reason, or taming
it to Religion? Goe leade a Lyon in a single haire, send
vp an Eagle to the skie to pecke out a starre, cope vp
the thunder, and quench a flaming City with one wid|dowes
teares: if thou couldest doe these, yet <HI>nescit mo|do
lingua domari: the Tongue can no man tame.</HI> As the
Proposition is backed with two reasons; so each rea|sons;
<PB N="22" REF="83">
so each reason hath a terrible second, The <HI>Euill</HI>
hath for the second vnrulines: the <HI>Poisonfulnes</HI> hath <HI>dead|ly.</HI>
It is <HI>evil,</HI> yea <HI>vnruly euill:</HI> it is <HI>poyson,</HI> yea, <HI>deadly poyson.</HI>
The Fort is so barricadoed, that it is hard scaling it: the
refractary Rebell so guarded with <HI>Euill</HI> and <HI>Poyson,</HI> so
warded with <HI>vnruly</HI> and <HI>deadly;</HI> as if it were with Gyants
in an vnchanted Towre, as they fabulate; that <HI>no man
can tame it.</HI> Yet let vs examine the matter, and finde a
stratagem to subdue it.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>In the Proposition.</HEAD>
<P>Wee will obserue, 1. The Nature of the thing to
bee tamed. 2. The difficulty of accomplishing it. The
insubiectible subiect is the <HI>Tongue:</HI> which is, 1. a mem|ber,
and 2. an

Member,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>It is a Member.</HEAD>
<P>Hee that made all, made the <HI>Tongue:</HI> he that craues
all, must haue the <HI>Tongue. Quicreavit necessariam, postu|lat
creatam.</HI> It is an instrument, let it giue Musicke to
him that made it. All creatures in their kind blesse
God. <HI>Psal.</HI> 148. They that wanttongues, as the hea|uens,
Sunne, Starres, Meteors, Orbes, Elements;
prayse him with such obedient Testimonies, as their
insensible natures can afford. They that haue tongues,
though they want reason, prayse him with those natu|rall
Organs. The birds of the ayre sing, the beasts of
the earth make a noyse; not so much as the hissing
Serpents, the very <HI>Dragons in the deepe,</HI> but sound out
<PB N="23" REF="83">
his praise. Man then, that hath a tongue, and a reason
to guide it, (and if more, a religion to direct his rea|son)
should much, much more blesse him. Therefore
sayes the <HI>Psalmographer,</HI> that for the well tuning of his
<HI>Tongue,</HI> is called the <HI>sweete Singer of Israel, I will praise
the Lord with the best Instrument I haue;</HI> which was his
<HI>Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>Not that praises can adde to Gods glory, nor blas|phemies
detract from it. The blessing <HI>Tongue</HI> cannot
make him better,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in Psal. 134</NOTE> nor the cursing, worse. <HI>Nec melior si
laudaueris, nec deterior si vituperaueris.</HI> As the Sunne is
neither betterd by birds singing, nor battered by dogs
barking. He is so infinitely great, and constantly good,
that his glory admittes neyther addition, nor diminu|tion.</P>
<P>Yet we that cannot make his name greater, can make
it seeme greater: and though wee can not enlarge his
glory, we may enlarge the manifestation of his glory.
This both in words praysing, and in workes practi|sing.
We know it is impossible to make a new <HI>Christ,</HI>
as the Papists boast the almightinesse of their Priests:
yet our holy liues, and happy lippes (if I may so speak)
may make a little <HI>Christ,</HI> a great <HI>Christ.</HI> They that be|fore
little regarded him, may thus be brought to e|steeme
him greatly: giuing him the honour due to his
name, and glorifying him, after our example.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>Tongues</HI> office. One member, without
arrogating any merite, or boasting the beholdingnesse
of the rest vnto it, is to doe that duetie which is assig|ned
it. The eye is to see for all, the eare to heare for all,
the hand to worke for all, the feete to walke for all, the
knees to bow for all, the <HI>Tongue</HI> to praise GOD for
all. This is the <HI>Tongues</HI> office, not vnlike the Towne|clarkes,
which if it performe not well, the Corporation
is better without it. The <HI>Tongue</HI> is mans clapper, and is
<PB N="24" REF="84">
giuen him, that hee may sound out the praise of his
maker.</P>
<P>Infinite causes draw deseruingly from mans lippes, a
deuout acknowledgement of Gods praise.  Quia

<P>For the Maiestie of it, it carries an imperious speech:
wherein it hath the preeminence of all mortal creatures.
It was mans <HI>Tongue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. 2. 19</NOTE> to which the Lord gaue licence to
call all the liuing creatures, and to giue them names.
And it is a strong motiue to induce, and to beget in o|ther
terrene natures, a reuerence and admiration of
man. Therefore it is obserued, that God did punish
the ingratitude of <HI>Balaam,</HI> when hee gaue away some
of the dignity proper to man, which is vse of speech,
and imparted it to the Asse, man alone speakes. I know
that spirites can frame an aeriall voyce, as the Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ell
<PB N="25" REF="84">
when he spake in the Serpent that fatall temptation, as
in a Truncke; but man onely hath the habituall facul|tie
of speaking.</P>
<P>For the Pleasantnesse of the tongue; the generall
consent of all giues it the truest <HI>Melos,</HI> and restraines
all musicall organs from the worth and praise of it: <HI>Ec|cles.</HI>
40.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 40. 21</NOTE> <HI>The pipe and the Psalterie make sweete melodie: but
a pleasant tongue is aboue them both.</HI> No instruments are
so rauishing, or preuaile ouer mans heart with so power|full
complacencie, as the <HI>Tongue</HI> and voyce of man.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Tongue</HI> be so excellent, how then doth this
Text censure it for so euill? I take the Philosophers old
and trite answere. <HI>Linguanihil est, vel bona melius, vel ma|la
peius.</HI> Then a good <HI>Tongue,</HI> there is nothing better;
then an euill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieron.</NOTE> nothing worse. <HI>Nihil habet medium: aut
grande bonum est, aut grande malum.</HI> It hath no meane; it
is eyther exceedingly good, or excessiuely euill. It
knowes nothing but extreames: and is or good best of
all, or bad worst of all. If it be good, it is a walking gar|den,
that scatters in euery place a sweet flower, an hearb
of grace to the hearers. If it be euill, it is a wilde Bed|lam,
full of gadding and madding mischiefes. So the
<HI>Tongue</HI> is euery mans best, or worst moueable.</P>
<P>Heereupon that Philosophicall seruant, when hee
was commanded to prouide the best meate for his Ma|sters
table, the worst for the family: bought &amp; brought
to either, neates tongues. His Morall was, that this was
both the best, and worst seruice; according to the good|nesse
or badnesse of the <HI>Tongue.</HI> A good <HI>Tongue</HI> is a spe|ciall
dish for Gods publike seruice. <HI>Parsoptima hominis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prud.</NOTE>
digna quae sit hostia.</HI> The best part of a man, and most
worthy the honour of sacrifice. This onely, when it is
well seasoned. <HI>Seasoned,</HI> I say, <HI>with salt;</HI> as the <HI>Apostle</HI>
admonisheth: not with fire. Let it not be so salt as fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coloss. 4. 6.</NOTE>
as that Prouerbe, which no man liuing hath tasted.
<PB N="26" REF="85">
There is <HI>a Citie of salt,</HI> mentioned, <HI>Ioshua</HI> 15. Let no
man be an Inhabitant of this <HI>salt-citie.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 15. 62</NOTE> Yet better a salt-tongue,
then an oily. Rather let <HI>the righteous reprooue
mee,</HI> then the <HI>precious balmes</HI> of flatterers breake <HI>my
head;</HI> whilst they most sensibly sooth and supple it. We
allow the <HI>Tongue</HI> salt, not pepper: let it be well seaso|ned,
but not too hote. Thus a good <HI>Tongue</HI> is GODS
dish, and he will accept it at his owne table.</P>
<P>But an euill <HI>Tongue</HI> is meate for the Diuell, accor|ding
to the Italian Prouerbe: The Diuell makes his
Christmasse pie of lewd <HI>Tongues.</HI> It is his daintiest dish,
and he makes much of it: whether on earth to serue his
turne as an instrument of mischiefe, or in hell to an|swere
his fury in torments. Thus saith <HI>Salomon</HI> of the
good <HI>Tongue.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pr. 10 20, 21</NOTE> <HI>The tongue of the iust is as choice siluer, and
the lippes of the righteous feede many.</HI> But Saint <HI>Iames</HI> of

<P>2. It is <HI>Necessary;</HI> so necessary, that without a <HI>tongue</HI>
I could not declare the necessitie of it. It conuerseth
with man, conueying to others by this organ that ex|perimentall
knowledge, which must else liue and die in
himselfe. It imparts secrets, communicates ioyes, which
would be lesse happy suppressed, then they are expres|sed:
mirth without a partner, is <HI>hilaris cum pondere foeli|citas.</HI>
But to disburden griefes, and powre foorth sor|rowes
in the bosome of a friend, O necessary tongue!
How many hearts would haue burst, if thou hadst not
giuen them vent! How many soules fallen groueling
vnder their loade, if thou hadst not called for some
supportance! How many a panting spirit hath sayd, I
will speake yet ere I die; and by speaking receiued com|fort!
Lastly, it speakes our deuotions to heauen, and
hath the honour to conferre with God. It is that In|strument
which the holy Ghost vseth in vs, to cry <HI>Ab|ba
Father.</HI> It is our spokesman: and hee that can heare
<PB N="27" REF="85">
the heart without a tongue, regardeth the deuotions of
the heart better, when they are sent vp by a diligent
messenger, a faithfull <HI>tongue.</HI></P>
<P>3. It is <HI>Little.</HI> As man is a little world in the great&punc; so
is his <HI>tongue</HI> a great world in the little. It is a <HI>little mem|ber,</HI>
saith the Apostle, verse 5. yet it <HI>is a world;</HI> verse 6.
yea <HI>prauitatis vniuersitas,</HI> a world of iniquitie. It is <HI>par|num,</HI>
but <HI>prauum;</HI> little in quantitie, but great in ini|quity.
What it hath lost in the thickenesse, it hath got
in the quickenesse: and the defect of magnitude is re|compenced
in the fortitude: an arme may bee longer,
but the <HI>Tongue</HI> is stronger; and a legge hath more flesh
then it hath, besides bones which it hath not, yet the
<HI>tongue</HI> still runnes quicker and faster; and if the wager
lie for holding out, without doubt the <HI>Tongue</HI> shall
winne it.</P>
<P>If it be a talking tongue, it is <HI>mundus garrulitatis,</HI> a
world of prating. If it be a wrangling tongue, it is <HI>mun|dus
litigationis,</HI> a world of brabbling. If it be a learned
tongue, it is as <HI>Erasmus</HI> sayd of Bishop <HI>Tonstall, mundus
eruditionis,</HI> a world of learning. If it be a petulant tong,
it is <HI>mundus scurrilitatis,</HI> a world of wantonnesse. If it be
a poysonous tongue, it is <HI>mundus infectionis,</HI> sayth our
Apostle, verse 6. <HI>it defileth the whole body.</HI> It is <HI>Little.</HI></P>
<P>So little, that it will scarce giue a Kite her breakefast,

world to walke through. <HI>Homuncio est, gigantea iactat,</HI>
verse 5. It is a <HI>Little member,</HI> yet <HI>boasteth great things.</HI></P>
<P>Though it be <HI>Little,</HI> yet if good, it is of great vse. A
little bitte guydeth a great horse, <HI>adequitis libitum,</HI> to the
Riders pleasure. A little helme, ruleth a great vessell:
though the windes blowe, and the floudes oppose, yet
the helme steares the shippe. Though little, yet if euill,

<P>It is <HI>Little</HI> in substance, yet <HI>great ad affectum,</HI> to pro|uoke
passion; <HI>ad effectum,</HI> to produce action. A Semi|naries
Tongue, is able to set Instruments on worke, to
blowe vp a Parliament. So God hath disposed it among
the members, that it gouernes or misgouernes all; and
is eyther a good King, or a cruell Tyrant. It eyther
precedes to good, or peruerts to euill; purifieth, or pu|trifieth
the whole carcasse, the whole conscience. It be|trayeth
the heart, when the heart would betray God:
and the Lord lets it double treason on it selfe, when it
preuaricates with him.</P>

<P>4. It is a <HI>singular</HI> member. God hath giuen man
<PB N="29" REF="86">
two eares, one to heare instructions of humane know|ledge,
the other to hearken to his diuine precepts; the
former to conserue his body, the latter to saue his soule.
Two eyes, that with the one hee might see to his owne
way, with the other pitty and commiserate his distres|sed
bre hren. Two hands, that with the one hee might
worke for his owne liuing, with the other giue and re|lieue
his brothers wants Two feete, one to walke on
common dayes to his ordinary labour:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 104. 23</NOTE> <HI>Man goes foorth
in the morning to his labour, and continues till the euening:</HI>
the other on sacred dayes to visite and frequent the
Temple, and the congregation of Saints. But among
all, hee hath giuen him but one <HI>Tongue:</HI> which may in|struct
him to heare twice so much as he speakes; to see
twice so much as he speakes: to worke, and walke twice
so much as he speakes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 139. 14</NOTE> <HI>I will praise thee (O Lord) for I am
fearefully and wonderfully made: maruaillous are thy workes,
and that my soule knoweth right well.</HI> Stay, and wonder at
the wonderfull wisedome of God.</P>
<P>1. To create so little a peece of flesh, and to put such
vigour into it: to giue it neyther bones nor nerues, yet
to make it stronger then armes and legges, and those
most able and seruiceable parts of the body.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12. 23</NOTE> So that as
<HI>Paul</HI> sayth, 1. <HI>Cor. 12. On those members of the body, which
we thinke lesse honourable, we bestow more abundant honour:
and our vncomely parts haue more abundant comelinesse.</HI> So
on this little weake member hath the Lord conferred
the greatest strength; and as feeble as it is, wee finde it
both more necessary, and more honourable.</P>
<P>2 Because it is so forcible, therefore hath the most
wise God ordayned, that it shall be but little, that it shall
be but one. That so the parvity and singularity may a|bate
the vigour, the rigour of it. If it were paired, as
the armes, legges, hands, feete, it would be much more
vnruly. For he that cannot <HI>tame</HI> one <HI>tongue,</HI> how would
<PB N="30" REF="87">
he be troubled with twaine! But so hath the Ordinator
prouided, that things of the fiercest and firyest nature,
should be little, that the malice of them might be some|what
restrayned.</P>
<P>3. Because it is so <HI>Vnruly,</HI> the Lord hath hedged it in,
as a man will not trust a wilde horse in an open pasture,
but prison him in a close pownd. A double fence hath
the Creator giuen to confine it, the lips and the teeth;
that through those mownds it might not breake. And
hence a threefold instruction for the vse of the <HI>Tongue,</HI>
is insinuated to vs.</P>
<P>1. Let vs not dare to pull vp Gods mownds; nor
like wilde beasts, breake through the circular limites,
wherein hee hath coped vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 28. 24</NOTE> <HI>Looke that thou hedge thy pos|session
about with thornes, and binde vp thy siluer and golde.</HI>
What, doth the wise man intend to giue vs some thrif|tie
counsell, and spend his inke in the rules of good hus|bandry,
which euery worldling can teach himselfe? No;
Yes: he exhorteth vs to the best husbandry, how to
guyde and guard our <HI>Tongues,</HI> and to thriue in the good
vse of speech. Therefore declares himselfe; <HI>Weigh thy
words in a ballance, and make a doore and barre for thy mouth.</HI>
Let this bee the possession thou so <HI>hedgest</HI> in, and thy
precious <HI>golde</HI> thou so <HI>bindest vp. Beware thou slide not by
it, lest thou fall before him that lyeth in waite.</HI> Commit not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urglary, by breaking the <HI>doores,</HI> and pulling downe
the <HI>barres</HI> of thy mouth.</P>
<P>Much more, when the Lord hath hung a locke on
it, doe not picke it with a false Key.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 51. 15</NOTE> Rather pray with
<HI>Dauid, Psal. 51. O Lord open thou my lippes, and my mouth

<P>Let thy words be few, true, weighty, that thou maist
not speake much, not falsely, not vainely. Remember
thy bounds, and keepe the <HI>non vltra.</HI></P>
<P>2. Since God hath made the <HI>tongue</HI> one, haue not
thou a <HI>tongue</HI> and a <HI>tongue.</HI> Some are double-tongued,
as they are double-hearted. But God hath giuen one
tongue, one heart; that they might bee one indeed, as
they are in number. It is made simple, let it not be dou|ble.
God hath made vs men, we make our selues mon|sters.
He hath giuen vs two eyes, two eares, two hands,
two feete. Of all these we will haue, or at lest vse but
one. We haue one eye to pry into others faults, not an
other to see our owne. Wee haue one eare to heare the
Plaintife, not the other for the Defendant. We haue
a foote swift to enter forbidden paths, not another to
leade vs to Gods holy place. We haue one hand to ex|tort,
and scrape, and wound, and not another to re|lieue,
giue almes, heale the wounded. But now where|as
God hath giuen vs, but one <HI>tongue,</HI> and one heart,
and bidden vs be content with their singularity; we will
haue two tongues, two hearts. Thus crosse are wee to
God, to Nature, to Grace: monstrous men; <HI>monoculi,
monopedes; bicordes, bilingues:</HI> one-eyed, one-footed;
double-tongued, double-hearted. The slaunderer, the
flatterer, the swearer, the tale-bearer are monstrous (I
dare scarce adde) men: as mis-shapen Stigmatickes, as
if they had two tongues, and but one eye: two heades,
and but one foote.</P>
<P>3. This convinceth them of preposterous folly, that
put all their malice into their <HI>tongue,</HI> as the Serpent all
her poyson in her tayle. And as it were by a chymicall
<PB N="32" REF="88">
power, attract all vigor thither, to the weakening and
enervation of the other parts. Their hands have <HI>chira|gram;</HI>
they can not stretch them foorth to the poore,
nor give reliefe to the needy. Their feete <HI>podagram,</HI> they
can not goe to the Church. Their eyes <HI>opthalmiam,</HI>
they can not behold the miserable and pitty-needing.
Their eares <HI>surditatem,</HI> they can not heare the Gospell
preached. Oh how defective and sicke all these mem|bers
are! But their <HI>Tongues</HI> are in health; there is blith|nesse
and volubillity in them. If they see a distressed
man, they can give him talkative comfort enough;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 2. 16</NOTE> <HI>Be|warmed,
be filled, be satisfied:</HI> they can fill him with Scrip|ture-sentences;
but they send him away with an hun|gry

foolishnesse; volat irrevocabile verbum.</HI> Words runne like
<HI>Hazael;</HI> but good workes, like the Creeple, come lag|ging
after.</P>
<P>We see the nature of the thing to be <HI>tamed,</HI> the <HI>tongue:</HI>
let vs consider the difficulty of this enterprise. <HI>No man
can</HI> doe it. Which wee shall best finde, if wee compare
it with other
<LIST>
<ITEM>members of the body.</ITEM>
<ITEM>creatures of the world.</ITEM>
</LIST>
With other members of the body: which are various
in their faculties and offices; none of them idle.</P>
<P>1. The eye sees farre, and beholdeth the creatures
<HI>in coelo, solo, salo:</HI> in the heavens, sunne and starres: on
the earth birds, beasts, plants, and mineralls: in the sea,
fishes and serpents. That it is an vnruly member, let our
Grand-mother speake; whose roving eye lost vs all.
Let <HI>Dinah</HI> speake, her wandring eye lost her virginitie,
caused the effusion of much blood. Let the <HI>Iewes</HI> speak
concerning the daughters of <HI>Madian;</HI> what a fearefull
<PB N="33" REF="88">
apostacie the <HI>Eye</HI> procured. Yea let <HI>Dauid</HI> acknow|ledge,
whose petulant eye robbed <HI>Vriah</HI> of his wife and
life, the land of a good souldier, his owne heart of much
peace. Yet this <HI>eye,</HI> as <HI>vnruly</HI> as it is, hath beene <HI>tamed.</HI>
Did not <HI>Iob make a couenant with his eyes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 31. 1</NOTE> <HI>that hee would
not looke vpon a maide?</HI> The eye hath beene tamed, but
the tongue can no man tame; it is an vnruly, &amp;c.</P>
<P>2. The eare yet heares more, then ever the eye saw:
and by reason of the patulous admission, derives that
to the vnderstanding, whereof the sight never had a
glaunce. It can listen to the whisperings of a <HI>Doeg,</HI> to
the susurrations of a Divell, to the Boyse of a <HI>Syren,</HI> to
the voyce of a <HI>Delilah.</HI> The Parasite through his win|dore
creepes into the great mans favour: hee tunes his
warbling notes to an enlarged eare. It is a wilde mem|ber,
an Instrument that Sathan delights to play vpon.
As <HI>vnruly</HI> as it is, yet it hath beene <HI>tamed. Mary sate at
the feete of Christ,</HI> and heard him preach with glad at|tention.
The eare hath beene tamed, but the <HI>Tongue
can no man tame, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>3. The foote is an vnhappy member, and carries a
man to much wickednesse. It is often <HI>swift</HI> to the <HI>shed|ding
of blood:</HI> and runneth away from God <HI>Ionahs</HI> pace;
flying to <HI>Tharshish,</HI> when it is bound for <HI>Niniueh.</HI> There
is <HI>a foote of pride, Psal.</HI> 36. a sawcie foote,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 36. 11</NOTE> that dares pre|sumptuously
enter vpon Gods free-hold. There is a
foote of rebellion, that with an apostate malice kickes
at God. There is a dauncing foote, that paceth the mea|sures
of circular wickednesse. Yet as <HI>vnruly</HI> as this foote
is, it hath beene tamed. <HI>David</HI> got the victory over it.
<HI>I considered my wayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 59</NOTE> and turned my foote vnto thy testimo|nies.</HI>
The foote hath beene tamed, but the <HI>Tongue can

<P>4. The hand rageth and rangeth with violence, to
take the bread it never sweat for, to enclose fields, to de|populate
<PB N="34" REF="89">
Townes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Micah 2. 2</NOTE> to lay waste whole countries. <HI>They
couet fields, and houses, and vineyards, and take them, because
their Hand hath power.</HI> There is a hand of extortion, as
<HI>Ahabs</HI> was to <HI>Naboth;</HI> the greedy landlords to the poore
tenant. There is a hand of fraud, and full of <HI>Liegerdu|maine,</HI>
as the vsurers to his distressed borrower. There
is a hand of bribery, as <HI>Iudas,</HI> with his <HI>Quantum dabi|tis;</HI>
what will you giue me to betray the Lord of Life.
There is a hand of lust, as <HI>Ammons</HI> to an incestuous
rape. There is a hand of murder, as <HI>Ioabs</HI> to <HI>Abner,</HI> or
<HI>Absolons</HI> to <HI>Ammon.</HI> O how <HI>vnruly</HI> hath this member
beene! yet it hath beene tamed: not by washing it in
<HI>Pilates</HI> basin, but in <HI>Davids</HI> holy-Water, <HI>Innocence. I will
wash my hands in innocencie, and then, O Lord, will I com|passe
thine altar.</HI> Heereuppon hee is bolde to say; <HI>Lord,
looke if there be any iniquitie in my hands.</HI> God did repudi|ate
all the Iewes sacrifices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 7. 3.</NOTE> because <HI>their hands were full of
blood. Davids</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 1</NOTE> hands had beene besmeared with the as|persions
of lust and blood; but hee had penitently ba|thed
them in his owne teares: and because that could
not get out the staines, he faithfully renseth and clean|seth
them in his Sonnes and Saviours fountayne, the
all-meritorious blood of Christ. This made them look
white:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 18. 24.</NOTE> whiter then Lillies in Gods sight. <HI>Therefore hath
the Lord recompensed mee according to my righteousnesse: ac|cording
to the cleanenesse of my hands in his eye-sight.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the eye, the eare, the foote, the hand, though
wilde and <HI>vnruly</HI> enough, have been <HI>tamed; but the tongue
can no man tame: it is an vnruly evill, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>With other creatures of the world; whether we find
them in the earth, ayre, or water.</P>
<P>1. On the earth, there is the man-hating Tyger; yet
man hath subdued him; and (they write) a little boy
hath led him in a string. There is the flocke-devouring
wolfe, that stands at grinning defiance with the sheep|heard;
<PB N="35" REF="89">
madde to have his prey, or loose himselfe; yet
he hath beene tamed. The roaring Lyon, whose voice
is a terror to man, by man hath beene subdued. Yea,
serpents, that haue to their strength two shrewd addi|tions,
subtilty, and malice; that carry venime in their
mouths, or a sting in their tayles, or are all over poy|sonous;
the very basiliske, that killes with his eyes, as
they write, three furlongs off. Yet all these savage, furi|ous,
malicious natures have beene <HI>tamed, but the tongue
can no man tame: it is an vnruly evill, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. In the sea there be great wonders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 108. 24</NOTE> <HI>They that goe
downe to the sea in shippes, and doe businesse in great waters.
These see the workes of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.</HI>
Yet those naturall wonders have beene tamed by our
artificiall wonders, shippes. Even the <HI>Leviathan</HI> him|selfe;
<HI>Out of whose mouth goe burning Lampes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 41. 19</NOTE> <HI>and sparkes of
fire. Out of his nosthrils goeth smoke, as out of a boyling Cal|dron.
Squama squamae couiungitur; the flakes of his flesh are
ioyned together; they are firme in themselves, and cannot bee
moved.</HI> Yet we know, that this huge creature hath been
tamed; but <HI>the tongue can no man tame, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>3. In the ayre, the Birds flie high aboue our reach,
yet we have ginnes to fetch them downe. A lure stoops
the highest-soaring hawke. Nay, Art makes one foule
catch another, for mans delight and benefite. Incre|dible
things, if they were not ordinary. Snares, lime|twigges,
net<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es tame them all: even the Pellican in the
Desart, and the Eagle amongst the cedars. Thus saith
our <HI>Apostle,</HI> verse 7. <HI>Every kinde</HI> (not every one of eve|ry
kinde, but every kinde or nature of all) <HI>of beasts, of
birds, of serpents, and of things in the Sea, is tamed, and hath
beene tamed of the nature of man: but the Tongue can no man
tame, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus farre then Saint <HI>Iames</HI> his proposition passeth
without opposition. <HI>The tongue can no man tame.</HI> The
<PB N="36" REF="90">
tongue is too wilde for any manstaming. It would be
a foolish exception, (and yet there are such profane
tongues to speake it) that woman stands without this
compasse and latitude: and to inferre, that though <HI>no
man can tame the tongue,</HI> yet a woman may: It is most vn|worthy
answere. Woman, for the most part, hath the
glibbest tongue: and if euer this impossibility preclude
man, it shall much more annihilate the power of that
weaker sex.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 7. 11 and 9. 13</NOTE> <HI>She is lowd,</HI> sayth <HI>Solomon: a foolish woman

weapon; she meanes offensiue: a fire brand in a fran|ticke
hand doth lesse mischiefe. The Prouerbe came
not from nothing; when we say of a brawling man, he
hath a womans tongue in his head.</P>
<P><HI>The tongue can no man tame.</HI> Let vs listen to some
weightier exceptions. The Prophets spake the oracles
of life, and the Apostles, the words of saluation; and
many mens speech <HI>ministers grace to the hearers.</HI> Yielde
it; yet this generall rule will haue no exception: <HI>no man
can tame it:</HI> man hath no sterne for this shippe, no bri|dle
for this colt. How then? God tamed it. We by na|ture
stammer as <HI>Moses,</HI> till God open a doore of vtte|rance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 6. 5</NOTE>
<HI>I am of vncleane lippes,</HI> sayth the Prophet, <HI>and
dwell with people of vncleane lippes.</HI> God must lay a <HI>coale of
his owne altar</HI> vpon our tongues, or they can not bee
<HI>tamed.</HI></P>
<P>And when they are tamed, yet they often haue an
vnruly tricke. <HI>Abraham</HI> lies, <HI>Moses</HI> murmurs, <HI>Elias</HI>
for feare of a Queene and a queane wisheth to die, <HI>Io|nas</HI>
frets for the Gourd, <HI>Dauid</HI> cries in his heart, <HI>All
men are lyers:</HI> which speech rebounded euen on God
himselfe; as if the Lord by <HI>Samuel</HI> had deceiued him:
<HI>Peter</HI> forswears his Master, his Sauiour. If the tongues
of the iust haue thus tripped, how should the profane
goe vpright? <HI>The tongue can no man tame.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="90">
The instruction hence riseth in full strength; that
God onely can tame mans tongue. Now the principall
actions heereof are: first, to open the mouth, when it

<P>To open our lippes when they should speake, is the
sole worke of God, <HI>Psalme 51. 15 O Lord open thou my
lippes, and then my mouth shall be able to shew forth thy praise.</HI>
God must open with his golden key of grace, or else our
tongues will arrogate a licentious passage. We had bet|ter
holde our peace, and let our tongues lie still, then
to set them a running, till God bids them goe. God
commaunds euery sinner to confesse his iniquities: this

His adultery cryed, his murder cryed, his ingratitude
cryed for reuenge: but still <HI>Dauid</HI> was mute; and so
long, <HI>day and night the hand of the Lord was heauy vppon

thou for gauest the iniquity of my sinne.</HI> It is Christ, that must

He did <HI>open Lidia's</HI> heart, to conceiue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 16 2 Kings 6 Esay 50. 5 Coloss. 4. 3</NOTE> He did <HI>open Eli|shaes</HI>

<P>To shut our lippes, when they should not speake, is
onely the Lords worke also. It is Christ that casts out
the talking Diuell: he shuts the wicket of our mouth a|gainst

may onely exercise his savage cruelty vpon the stone
wals, or yron grates. But the tongue is so placed, that
being <HI>euill</HI> and <HI>vnruly,</HI> it hurts all the members.</P>
<P>2. To our Neighbours. There are some sinnes that
hurt not the doer onely, but many sufferers. These are
districtly the sinnes of the tongue and the hand. There
are other sinnes private and domesticall: the sting and
smart whereof dyes in the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ne soule; and without fur|ther
extent, plagues onely the person of the commit|ter.
So the Lavish is sayde, no mans foe but h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s own:
the proud is guilty of his owne vanity: the slothfull
beares his owne reproch: and the malicious wasteth
the marrow of his owne bones, whiles his envied obiect
shines in happinesse. Though perhaps these sinnes in|sensibly
wrong the common-wealth, yet the principall
and immediate blow lights on themselues. But some
iniquities are swords to the Countrey; as oppression,
rapine, circumvention: some incendiaries to the whole
land; as <HI>evill</HI> and <HI>vnrnly tongues.</HI></P>
<P>3 To the whole world. If the vastate ruines of an|cient
monuments, if the depopulation of Countries, if
the consuming fires of contention, if the land manured
with bloud; had a tongue to speake, they wold all accuse
the <HI>Tongue</HI> for the originall cause of their woe. Slaugh|ter
is a lampe, and bloud the oyle; and this is set on fire
by the tongue.</P>
<P>You see the latitude and extention of this <HI>vnruly evill;</HI>
nor evnraly then the hand. Slaughters, massacres, op|pressions
are done by the hand: the tongue doth more.
<HI>Parcit manus absenti, lingua n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mini.</HI> The hand spares to
hurt the absent, the tongue hurts all. One may avoid
<PB N="41" REF="92">
the sword by runni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g from it; not the tongue, though
he runne to the Indies. The hand reacheth but a small
compasse, the tongue goes through the world. If a man
wore coate of armour, or maile of brasse; yet, <HI>Penetra|bunt
spicula linguae;</HI> The darts of the tongue will pierce it.</P>
<P>It is <HI>evill,</HI> and doth much harme; it is <HI>vnruly,</HI> and
doth sudden harme. You will say, many wicked men
haue often very silent tongues. True, they know their
times and places, when and where to seeme mute. But
<HI>Ieremy</HI> compounds the wisedome and folly of the <HI>Iewes:</HI>
That <HI>they were wise to do evill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 4. 22</NOTE> <HI>but to do good they had no vn|derstanding.</HI>
So I may say of these, they haue tongue e|nough
to speake euill, but are dumbe when they should
speake well.</P>
<P>Our Sauiour in the dayes of his flesh on earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 11. 14</NOTE> was of|ten
troubled with <HI>dumbe</HI> Deuils: but now he is as much
troubled with roaring Deuils. With the fawning Sy|cophant,
a pratling Deuill. With the malicious slaun|derer,
a brawling Deuill. With the vnquiet peace-ha|ter,
a scolding Deuill. With the auarous and ill-con|scious
Lawyer, a wrangling Deuill. With the factious
Schismaticke, a gaping Deuill. With the swaggering
ruffian, a roaring Deuill. All whom Christ by his mi|nisters
doth coniure, as he once did that crying Deuill;

h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e that daily commits new sinnes, and doth not peni|tently
confesse his olde, roares much, yet holdes
his tongue. The Father pricked the pleurisie-vaine of
our times. For wee haue many roarers, but dumbe
roarers: though they can make a hellish noyse in a Ta|uerne,
and sweare downe the Deuill himselfe; yet to

praise God, they are as mute as fishes.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Iames</HI> heere calles it <HI>fire.</HI> Now you know fire
is an ill maister: but this is <HI>vnruly</HI> fire. Nay, hee calles it
the <HI>fire of hell;</HI> blowne with the bellows of malice, kind|led
with the breath of the deuill. Nay, <HI>Stella</HI> hath a con|ceit,
that it is worse then the fire of hell: for that tor|ments
onely the wicked, this all, both good and bad.
For it is <HI>Flabellum, invids,</HI> and <HI>Flagellum, iusti.</HI> Swea|rers,
railers, scoldes haue hell-fire in their tongues.</P>
<P>This would seeme incredible, but that God sayth it
is true. Such are hellish people, that spet abroad the
flames of the deuill It is a cursed mouth that spets fire:
how should wee auoyde those, as men of hell! many are
afraid of hell fire, yet nourish it in their owne tongues.
By this kinde of Language, a man may know who is of
hell. There are three sorts of languages obserued. Ce|lestiall,
terrestriall, and infernall. The heauenly lan|guage
is spoken by the Saints, <HI>Blessed are they that dwell
in thy house:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 84. 4</NOTE> <HI>they will be still praising thee.</HI> Their discourse
is habituated, like their course or co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uersation; which
<HI>Paul</HI> saith is <HI>heauenly.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 3. 20.</NOTE> The earthly tongue is spoken of
worldlings, <HI>He that is of the earth, is earthly: and speaketh
of the earth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 3. 31</NOTE> Worldly talke is for worldly men. The in|fernall
language is spoken by men of hell; such as haue
beene taught by the deuill: they speake like <HI>men of Be|lial.</HI>
Now, as the Countrey man is knowne by his lan|guage:
and as the Damosell tolde <HI>Peter; Sure thou art
of Galile, for thy speech bewrayeth thee:</HI> so by this rule,
you may know heauenly men by their gracious confe|rence:
earthly men by their worldly talke: and hellish,
by the language of the lowe Countries, swearing, cur|sing,
blasphemy.</P>
<P>Well the efore did the <HI>Apostle</HI> call this <HI>Tongue</HI> a <HI>fire;</HI>
and such a fire, as sets the whole world in combustion.
Let these <HI>vnruly tongues</HI> take heede lest by their roarings

they shake the battlements of heauen; and so waken

that a voice is made by the lippes, teeth, throat, tongue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Psalmographer</HI> on euery one of these hath set a

<P>I cannot omit the Morall of that old Fable. Three
children call one man Father, who brought them vp.
Dying, he bequeaths all his estate only to one of them,
as his true naturall sonne; but which that one was, left
vncertaine. Heereupon euery one claimes it. The wise
Magistrate for speedy decision of so great an ambigui|tie;
causeth the dead father to be set vp as a marke; pro|mising
the chalengers, that which of them could shoot
next his heart, should enioy the Patrimony. The elder
shootes, so doth the second, both hitte: but when it
came to the yongers turne, he vtterly refused to shoot:
good nature would not let him wound that man dead,
that bred and fed him liuing. Therfore the Iudge gaue
<PB N="45" REF="94">
all to this sonne, reputing the former bastards. I he
scope of it is plaine, but significant. God will neuer
giue them the Legacie of Glory, giuen by his Sonne
Will to children; that like bastards shoot through, and
wound his blessed Name. Thinke of this, ye swearing
and cursing to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gues</P>
<P>To conclude, God shall punish such <HI>Tongues</HI> in their
owne kinde: they were <HI>full of poison,</HI> and the poyson of
another stench shall swell them. They haue beene en|flamed,
and shal be tormented with the fire of hell. Bur|ning
shall be added to burning; saue that the first was
actiue, this passiue. The rich glutton, that when his
belly was full, could loose his tong to blasphemie, wan|ted
water to coole his tongne. His tongue sinned, and
his tongue smarted. Though his torment was vniuer|sall,
yet he complaines of his tongue. That panted, that
smoked, that reeked with sulphur and brimstone: that
burnes with the flame of hell dead, that burned with it
liuing. For a former tune of sinne, it hath a present
tune of woe. It scalded, and is scalded: as it cast abroad
the flames of hell in this world, so all the flames of hell
shall bee cast on it in the world to come. It hath fired,
and shall bee fired, with such fire as is not to bee quen|ched.</P>
<P>But blessed is the sanctified <HI>tongue.</HI> God doth now
chuse it as an instrument of musicke, to sing his praise;
hee doth water it with the sauing dewes of his
mercie, and will at last aduaunce
it to glorie.</P>
