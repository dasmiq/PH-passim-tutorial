<HEAD>TO THE Right Honourable JAMES, EARL of ABINGDON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN all Ages the greatest and wisest of Mankind have been the <HI>Patrons of Poesie</HI>; They have taken the Authors into their <HI>Con|verse,</HI>
<PB REF="3">
and their Works into their <HI>Bosoms,</HI> and both in the one and the other have not fail'd of an agree|able, and, oft, a <HI>Divine Entertain|ment:</HI> But neither of these is to be expected from <HI>Me,</HI> or my <HI>Writings:</HI> These <HI>Poets</HI> might pretend their Merit to the Favour and Protection of their <HI>Patrons</HI>; Whereas, I must consider your Lordship's Conde|scension to me meerly as an effect of your Goodness, which, because it would have me do well, gave me Encouragement, though to do well was not really in my Power: How|ever, when <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> were my Subjects, I never fail'd to exert my <HI>Endeavours.</HI> You found me, my Lord, an <HI>Orphan,</HI> without For|tune or Friends, and have rais'd me
<PB REF="3">
to both; I have had the smiles of many Persons, because they knew I had your Lordship's; Your <HI>Ap|probation</HI> was the <HI>Stamp</HI> that made me pass almost <HI>Vnquestion'd,</HI> though, at the same time, you knew, or at least I was conscious to my self, the Metal was not right <HI>Sterling.</HI> Nor has your Lordship only rais'd me, and left me there, but setled upon me such a competence as has fixt my Ambition. Showing the World you are of the same mind of <HI>Timon</HI> in <HI>Shakespear,</HI>
<Q>'Tis not enough to help the feeble up, But to support him after.</Q></P>
<P>But I am not the only proof, by many, of your Lordship's Bounty;
<PB REF="4">
'tis of a more diffusive Nature than to be so narrowly confin'd: No Man that ever had the Honour of being a <HI>Retainer</HI> to your Lordship, but has known it in a high degree; To be admitted your <HI>Menial</HI> is, in effect, a Maintainance for Life: And what may the good Servant expect when even the bad (such as my self) meet with Rewards so unpropor|tion'd to any Merit they can pre|tend by their Service? Neither are these Showres of Liberality rain'd only on your <HI>Domesticks</HI>; Stran|gers, as well as they, have their share. The Widow, the Father|less, and the Poor, are the conti|nual Objects of your Charity; a|mid'st affairs of the highest moment (in which y'are now employ'd) you
<PB REF="4">
have a thought that stoops to the Relief of the Wretched. Our Di|vine <HI>Herbert</HI> tells us,
<Q>&mdash; All <HI>worldly Goods</HI> are less Than that <HI>one good</HI> of doing kind|nesses.</Q></P>
<P>This is a Principle you live up to in all its Latitude; for, certainly, your Lordship may pass under this general Character, that never any Man was known to you but to his Advantage. The Oath <HI>Pindar</HI> en|joins his <HI>Muse</HI> (in Praise of <HI>Theron</HI> Prince of <HI>Agrigentum</HI>) might with equal Justice be said of your Lord|ship:
<Q><PB REF="5">
<L>Swear in no City e'r before,</L>
<L>A Better Man, or greater Soul was born;</L>
<L>Swear that <HI>Theron,</HI> sure, has sworn</L>
<L>No Man near him shou'd be poor;</L>
<L>Swear that none e'r had such a grace|ful Art,</L>
<L>Fortunes <HI>Free</HI> Gifts as <HI>freely</HI> to im|part</L>
<L>With an <HI>unenvious hand,</HI> and an <HI>un|bounded Heart.</HI></L>
<BIBL>Cowley.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Respect I bear to Gratitude and Truth, and the unfeigned Duty I owe your Lordship, wou'd not suffer me to pass by making this Declaration, which possibly may be no derogation or lessening of your Fame, if what I have written
<PB REF="5">
happen to live to Posterity: They will then see (bad as this Age is) there was some Vertue extant, that there was one just <HI>Theme,</HI> at least, for <HI>Panegyrick</HI> amid'st our num'rous <HI>Subjects</HI> for <HI>Satyr.</HI> And, indeed, it must be a sublime Pen that does your Lordship Right; who were one of the very first that appear'd in the glorious Occasion of redeeming us from the Merciless Jaws of Po|pery and Slavery, and once more make the reform'd Religion flourish in its primitive Purity, as deliver'd to us by the holy <HI>Apostles,</HI> before <HI>Innovation</HI> and <HI>Superstition</HI> had crept in, and the <HI>grand Impostor</HI> tramp|led upon <HI>Crowns</HI> and <HI>Mitres. Piety</HI> and not <HI>Power</HI> is the <HI>Rock</HI> on which the <HI>Church</HI> shou'd be founded.</P>
<Q><PB REF="6">
<L>The <HI>Fisher</HI> to convert the World began,</L>
<L>The Pride convincing of vain-glo|rious Man;</L>
<L>But soon his <HI>Follower</HI> grew a <HI>So|vereign Lord,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Keys</HI> exchang'd for <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Sword,</HI></L>
<L>Which still maintains for his <HI>ado|pted Son</HI></L>
<L>Vast <HI>Patrimonies,</HI> though himself had <HI>none</HI>;</L>
<L>Wresting the Text to the old <HI>Gy|ant</HI>'s sense,</L>
<L>That Heav'n, once more, must suf|fer violence.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Denham.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>'Tis indisputable, <HI>Popery,</HI> for many Years, has been the source
<PB REF="6">
of all the <HI>Troubles</HI> and <HI>Divisions</HI> a|mong us: And nothing less than we have felt, cou'd be expected from the <HI>restless Temper</HI> and <HI>diligent Ma|lice</HI> of our <HI>Adversaries.</HI> We have now a new Example (though the old ones, methinks, might have serv'd) That <HI>Nature, Piety, Bro|therly Love</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> with all the <HI>Sacred Ties</HI> that constitute <HI>Christia|nity,</HI> are of no more strength to them, than <HI>Sampson</HI>'s Cords when his <HI>Harlot</HI> said, <HI>The Philistins are upon thee.</HI> Had things run on in that Chanel they had cut for 'em, we are not sure the Blood had till now been running in our Veins. But 'tis to be hoped our <HI>Fears</HI> of the intro|ducing that <HI>Perswasion</HI> are over &mdash; It remains we should be thankful for
<PB REF="7">
our <HI>Deliverance,</HI> Honour our <HI>De|liverers;</HI> and endeavour, by the Living up to the <HI>Religion</HI> we pro|fess, that Heav'n wou'd grant a Con|tinuance of it to us. But to be signal upon this Account, is not the only glory of your Lordship; your Life is but one continued Series of Ho|nourable Actions, which from the first, as well as at the late <HI>Crisis of Affairs,</HI> have been known to the Publick, and every where discours'd to your Advantage: <HI>Abingdon</HI> is a sound that has reacht every Ear: If <HI>Poets</HI> may presume so far, I cou'd methinks prophesy, that in after days no name will be more generally celebrated: They will ev'n then be secur'd by what has been done now; and seeing their <HI>Safety, Ease</HI> and
<PB REF="7">
<HI>Plenty,</HI> with a long Uninterruption of their <HI>Religion, Liberty</HI> and <HI>Pro|perty,</HI> sprung from such as your Lord|ship, who stood in the <HI>Breach</HI> when so bold a Blow was struck at the <HI>Fundamental Constitution</HI> of our happy Establisht Government, they must, consequently, reflect on your Memoires with double Veneration. The <HI>Poets,</HI> too, of those Times will not be ingrateful, but to your Issue describing the Gallantry of their great Progenitors, make 'em endea|vour to tread in the same tract of Glory. Nor indeed should I pass by this subject my self, but that 'twill be discretion to decline it, since I know I am incapable of doing it Justice; and for that Reason waving it, will be as great a kindness as the
<PB REF="8">
little Modesty I have, ever did me; for I am, now at last, thoroughly sa|tisfy'd of my inability of perform|ing any thing well in <HI>Poesie:</HI> And if a hearty Protestation of leaving off Writing in that way, and betaking my self to those Studies that may make me more useful in the Station your Lordship has placed me, will give me a better Title to your Lord|ship's Protection than any I can yet boast of, I shall not doubt to approve my self,</P>

<PB REF="8">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Should say something, methinks, in relation to the <HI>Papers</HI> I here publish; and truly the first thing I shall say is, that I do not con|ceive they deserve that trouble: How|ever, that the <HI>Reader</HI> may be en|clin'd to forgive some of the many Faults he will be sure to meet with, I must inform him they were all writ in an Age that has some <HI>Pretence</HI> to a <HI>Pardon</HI>; as also without those advan|tages of Learning, necessary for the management of such studies; the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine Poets</HI> being, in their <HI>Ori|ginal Tongues,</HI> wholly unknown to
<PB REF="9">
me. This is a kind of Confession that wou'd have grated some Men to have publish't, but 'tis Truth, and that takes away a little from the reproach on't, though I hope 'twill be thought none, since the avoidless Circumstan|ces I have been in deny'd me all access to the bettering my self by Letters, the necessary and daily Provision for an honest subsistence taking up my Time; and no Man can be Disposer of his Fate, a supreme hand governs. Notwithstanding, I must declare I found admittance into the best and most refin'd Conversation; But Con|versation, 'tis allow'd, is not able to make a <HI>Poet,</HI> though, indeed, it may improve him: There shou'd be a Foundation laid in the <HI>University,</HI> which also shou'd be mellow'd and pol|lisht
<PB REF="9">
by Travel and Correspondence, for that gives us a clearer Inspection into Men, and their variety of Dis|positions; without this, to speak plain, there will appear some of the <HI>Rust of the College</HI> in a Man's Manners and Intellect: A Man of <HI>general Know|ledge</HI> is not to be made so there; meer|ly for a <HI>Divine</HI> it may do indifferent well, yet 'twere better they knew the World more, without which they can|not truly teach us to despise it. Beside all this, there shou'd be some skill in the Modern as well as <HI>Learned Lan|guages,</HI> and a good Study of Books (some of all Authors) to resort to at Pleasure; for nothing but that which makes a <HI>truly accomplisht Gentle|man,</HI> can make a <HI>good Poet:</HI> and to push the Parallel home; as one
<PB REF="10">
born a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> unless his Edu|cation illustrate his Extraction, is more contemptible than the vilest Pea|sant: so a <HI>Poet,</HI> though so by <HI>Nature,</HI> will prove himself to be little better, unless <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> are ready at hand, to give the last <HI>touch</HI> and <HI>gracefulness</HI> to his <HI>Writings,</HI> and make that a <HI>finisht Piece,</HI> which before was but a <HI>Sketch,</HI> or <HI>Rough-Draught</HI> of the <HI>Fancy.</HI> A Man must have an equal Portion of both, though of dif|ferent <HI>Species</HI> they must be made one <HI>Individual,</HI> like the <HI>Hermaphrodite</HI> in <HI>Ovid,</HI> without which nothing can be produced that will bear the <HI>Test of Ages.</HI></P>
<Q><L>'Twas this the Ancients meant; <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Skill</HI></L>
<L>Are the <HI>two Tops</HI> of their <HI>Parnassus Hill.</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB REF="10">Thus Sir <HI>John Denham</HI> (who, indeed, in his <HI>Cooper's Hill</HI> has reacht those <HI>Two Tops</HI> he there speaks of; and if the most Excellent things de|serve most Imitation, certainly no Man ought to write in English without laying down that Poem as his Pattern; there we see of what our Language is capable, <HI>Life, Sweet|ness, Strength</HI> and <HI>Majesty.</HI>) <HI>And M^r Waller,</HI> whose Works claim the same Veneration, tells us,
<Q><L>Though <HI>Poets</HI> may of Inspiration boast,</L>
<L>Their Rage, ill govern'd, in the Clouds is lost;</L>
<L>He that proportion'd Wonders can disclose,</L>
<L>At once his <HI>Fancy</HI> and his <HI>Iudgment</HI> shows.</L></Q></P>
<P>And in the late Admirable <HI>Essay upon Poetry</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Mul|grave.</HI></P>
<Q><PB REF="11">
<L>As all is dullness when the <HI>Fancy</HI>'s bad,</L>
<L>So, without <HI>Iudgment, Fancy</HI> is but mad. &mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;<HI>Reason</HI> is that substantial useful part</L>
<L>That gains the <HI>Head,</HI> while tother wins the <HI>Heart.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>Ben Johnson,</HI> too, lets us know in his Elegie upon Divine <HI>Shake|spear,</HI>
<Q><L>That, though the <HI>Poet's Matter Nature</HI> be,</L>
<L>His <HI>Art</HI> must give the Fashion; and that <HI>He</HI></L>
<L>That means to write a <HI>Living Line</HI> must sweat,</L>
<L>And (<HI>without tiring</HI>) strike the <HI>second Heat</HI></L>
<L><HI>Upon the</HI> Muses Anvil,&mdash;</L>
<L>Or for the <HI>Lawrel</HI> he may purchase <HI>scorn</HI>;</L>
<L>For a <HI>good Poet</HI>'s <HI>made</HI> as well as <HI>born.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And, in short, the difficulty of being a good one is so very great, 'tis scarce attainable ev'n by the well Learned; for an <HI>Excellent Scholar</HI> may be a <HI>bad Poet</HI>; how hard is it then for one that is <HI>no Scholar</HI> to be a <HI>Good
<PB REF="11">
Poet?</HI> And indeed the Considera|tion of the Disadvantages I labour'd under, which made it impossible for me to be so, ought, in Discretion, to have made me lain down my Preten|sions to that <HI>Art,</HI> as soon as taken up, and not have follow'd the Violence of an <HI>Inclination,</HI> which though plea|sing to my self, might make me Ob|noxious to the just and sharp Rallery of the <HI>Criticks</HI>; as the late Fa|mous Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> naturally expresses it:
<Q><L>Your Muse <HI>diverts you,</HI> makes the <HI>Reader sad,</HI></L>
<L>You fancy y'are <HI>inspir'd,</HI> he thinks you <HI>mad</HI>;</L>
<L>Consider, too, 'twill be discreetly done</L>
<L>To make your self the <HI>Fiddle</HI> of the <HI>Town.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And certainly there is no worse Fate upon Earth than being laught at. &mdash; But if the <HI>Reader</HI> will for|give
<PB REF="12">
what is amiss, I will never give him any fresh Occasion for that Fa|vour; for here I renew my Promise (made to <HI>two great Men</HI>) of yield|ing up all my Engagements to that Study, together, if the <HI>Criticks</HI> please, with the very Name of a <HI>Poet,</HI> which I confess I do not de|serve; Resolving seriously never more to write a line, unless in command to those I dare not disobey; though ev'n there I am so far secur'd, that no man of sense will think it worth the while to lay such an Injunction upon me, and I pay no observance to Fools. Yet, methinks, I comfort my self with this, that by leaving off scribling be|times, the most malicious can but say I have thrown away the spare Inter|vals of five or six youthful years,
<PB REF="12">
which is in some sort aton'd, in that I shew the World 'tis possible for a <HI>Poet</HI> to lay aside <HI>Versifying,</HI> and en|cline to <HI>Business.</HI> However, thus far I may justly boast, that I am the first that ever, under thirty Years of Age, took a voluntary leave of the <HI>Muses.</HI></P>

<L>'TWas night, and, with a weight of grief opprest,</L>
<L>Though weary'd with much toil, I took no rest;</L>
<L>All wrapt in Melancholy thought I lay,</L>
<L>Wish't 'twou'd be ever dark, or soon be day:</L>
<L>But Heav'n, still mindful wretched man to ease,</L>
<L>Inspir'd me with a pleasing thought, when nothing else cou'd please;</L>
<L>A thought which all around did joy display,</L>

<L>Gods! streight I cry'd, why ly I longer here?</L>
<L>When Pleasure's nigh, why thus indulge my care?</L>
<L>Up, then, and to high Heav'n Devotion pay</L>
<L>For the return of this Auspicious Day,</L>
<L>The day that gave fair <HI>Adorissa</HI> Birth,</L>
<L>And with another <HI>Lucreece</HI> blest the Earth:</L>

<L>Which every <HI>Pen</HI> to write, and every <HI>Ear</HI></L>
<L>With an uncommon Joy inclines to hear!</L>
<L>While in her Conduct we see, fairly writ,</L>
<L>Her Mother's Heav'nly Modesty, her Father's pow'rful wit!</L>
<L>As thus I spoke, <HI>Aurora</HI>'s cheerful ray</L>
<L>Brought the glad Tydings of returning day,</L>

<L>No gloomy Cloud did interpose between</L>

<L>The Winds were hush't; only a balmy breeze,</L>
<L>With am'rous Wings, fann'd perfume through the Trees.</L>
<L>Lo! here, cry'd I again, when all around,</L>

<L>'Tis therefore, Fair One, that these lines you see,</L>

<L>Does not her Form, which we with Joy behold,</L>
<L>Transcend Fictitious <HI>Goddesses</HI> of old?</L>
<L>Yet Matchless though her Beauty be, her smile</L>
<L>Is not more sweet and lively than her stile;</L>
<L>Her Eyes themselves have not more moving charms,</L>

<L>Her Piety, unblemisht Love and Truth,</L>

<L>That's true Religion that does make you strive</L>
<L>To love your Neighbour, and the Poor relieve,</L>
<L>To do no wrong, nor at no wrong connive,</L>

<L>Here brave <HI>Alcander,</HI> on this bloody Stage,</L>
<L>Found work t' employ his Vertue and his Rage:</L>
<L>And, that his Loyalty might first be try'd,</L>
<L>He took the Royal, and the Suffering side.</L>
<L>In all Attempts still prodigal of blood,</L>

<L>Down fell the Banks, the Deluge enter'd fast,</L>

But for my Insufficiency, I beg their Pardon: this be|ing my first Essay in <HI>Pindarick,</HI> and likely to be the last; since nothing that can, or, at least, has of late been writ in this kind, is comparable to what that Ad|mirable <HI>Poet</HI> has done, who first retriev'd and made this stately way of writing familiar to us; and in|deed has perform'd so much, as cuts off all hope of like success to any that now do, or shall (I prophesie)

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. To the following Satyrs and Epistles.</HEAD>
<L>TO that Prodigious height of vice w' are grown,</L>

<L>That 'tis of late believ'd, nay fixt a rule,</L>
<L>Who ever is not vitious is a Fool;</L>
<L>Hiss't at by old and young, despis'd, opprest,</L>
<L>If he be not a Villain, like the rest:</L>
<L>Vertue and Truth are lost &mdash; search for <HI>good men,</HI></L>
<L>Among <HI>ten thousand</HI> you will scarce find <HI>ten.</HI></L>
<L>Half Wits conceited Coxcombs, Cowards, Braves,</L>
<L>Base Flatt'rers, and the endless Fry of Knaves,</L>
<L>Fops, Fools and Pimps you every where may find,</L>
<L>"And not to meet 'em you must shun Mankind.</L>
<L>The other <HI>Sex,</HI> too, whom we all adore,</L>
<L>When search'd, we still find rotten at the <HI>core,</HI></L>
<L>An old, dry <HI>Bawd,</HI> or a young, juicy <HI>Whore</HI>;</L>
<L>Their love all false, their Vertue but a name,</L>
<L>And nothing in 'em constant but their <HI>shame.</HI></L>
<L>What <HI>Saty'rist,</HI> then, that honest can sit still,</L>
<L>And, unconcern'd, see such a Tyde of ill,</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="85">With an impetuous force, o'erflow the Age,</L>
<L>And not strive to restrain it with his rage?</L>
<L>On Sin's vast Army seize, Wing, Reer and Van,</L>
<L>And, like Impartial Death, not spare a Man?</L>
<L>For where, alas! where is that mighty <HI>He,</HI></L>
<L>That is from <HI>Pride, Deceit</HI> and <HI>Envy</HI> free,</L>
<L>Or rather, is not tainted with all <HI>three?</HI></L>
<L>Mankind is Criminal, their Acts, their Thoughts;</L>
<L>'Tis Charity to tell 'em of their Fau'ts,</L>
<L>And <HI>shew</HI> their failings in a <HI>faithful Glass</HI>;</L>
<L>For who won't mend that <HI>sees</HI> he is an Ass?</L>
<L>And this design 'tis that employs my <HI>Muse,</HI></L>
<L>This for her daily <HI>Theme</HI> she's proud to chuse;</L>
<L>A <HI>Theme</HI> that she'l have daily need to use:</L>
<L>Let other <HI>Poets</HI> flatter, fawn and write,</L>
<L>To get some <HI>Guinnys</HI> and a <HI>Dinner</HI> by't;</L>

<L>Quite contrary her <HI>Practice</HI> shall appear;</L>
<L>Unbrib'd, Impartial, pointed and severe:</L>
<L>That way my <HI>Nature</HI> leans, compos'd of <HI>Gall</HI>;</L>
<L>I must <HI>write sharply,</HI> or not write at all.</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Thyrsis</HI> wings the Air in tow'ring flights,</L>
<L>And, to a wonder, <HI>Panegyrick</HI> writes;</L>
<L>Though he is still exalted and sublime,</L>
<L>Scarce to be marcht by past or present time;</L>
<L>Yet what <HI>Instruction</HI> can from hence accrue?</L>
<L>'Tis flatt'ry all, too fulsom to be true.</L>
<L>Urge not (for 'tis to vindicate the wrong)</L>
<L>It causes <HI>Emulation</HI> in the young,</L>
<L><PB N="133" REF="85">A thirst to Fame, while some high Act they read,</L>
<L>That spurs 'em to the same Romantick deed;</L>
<L>As if some pow'rful magick lay in <HI>Rhimes,</HI></L>
<L>That made men <HI>braver</HI> than at other times.</L>
<L>'Tis false and fond: &mdash; <HI>Hero</HI>'s may huff and fight,</L>
<L>But who can merit so as he can write?</L>
<L>To hold a <HI>Glow-worm</HI> is the <HI>morning Star,</HI></L>
<L>And that it may, with ease, be seen as far,</L>
<L>Were most ridiculous, so wide from truth,</L>
<L>It justly wou'd deserve a sharp reproof.</L>
<L>That wretch is more to blame, whose <HI>hireling Pen</HI></L>
<L>Calls Knaves and Coxcombs, wise deserving men,</L>
<L>Says that the vitious are with vertue grac't,</L>
<L><HI>Iudges</HI> all just, and all <HI>Court-Strumpets</HI> chast.</L>
<L>If to be prais'd does give a man pretence</L>
<L>To Glory, Honour, Honesty and Sense,</L>
<L><HI>Cromwell</HI> had much to say in his defence;</L>
<L>Who, though a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> which all ills comprize,</L>
<L>Has been extoll'd and lifted to the Skies:</L>
<L>While living (such was the applause they gave)</L>
<L>Counted High, Princely, Pious, Just and Brave,</L>
<L>And with <HI>Encomiums</HI> waited to the Grave.</L>
<L>Who then wou'd give this &mdash; for a <HI>Poet</HI>'s praise?</L>
<L>Which, rightly understood, does but debase,</L>
<L>And <HI>blast</HI> that Reputation it wou'd <HI>raise.</HI></L>
<L>Hence 'tis (and 'tis a Punishment that's fit)</L>
<L>They are condemn'd and scorn'd by <HI>men of wit:</HI></L>
<L>'Tis true, some <HI>Foplings</HI> nibble at their Praise,</L>
<L>And think it great to grace the Front of <HI>Plays</HI>;</L>
<L>Though most to that stupidity are grown,</L>
<L>They wave their <HI>Patron</HI>'s praise to write their <HI>own</HI>;</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="86">Yet they but seldom fail of their Rewards;</L>
<L>And, Faith, in that I cannot blame the <HI>Bards</HI>;</L>
<L>If Coxcombs will be Coxcombs, let 'em rue,</L>
<L>If they love Flatt'ry, let 'em pay for't too;</L>
<L>'Tis one sure method to convince the <HI>Elves</HI>;</L>
<L>They spare my pains and satyrize themselves.</L>
<L>In short, nought helps like <HI>Satyr</HI> to amend:</L>
<L>While in huge Volumes motly <HI>Priests</HI> contend,</L>
<L>And let their vain Disputes ne'r have an end,</L>
<L>They plunge us in those Snares we else shou'd shun;</L>
<L>Like <HI>Tinkers,</HI> make <HI>ten holes</HI> in mending <HI>one.</HI></L>
<L>Our dearest Friends, too, though they know our Fau'ts,</L>
<L>For <HI>pity,</HI> or for <HI>shame</HI> conceal their Thoughts,</L>
<L>While we, who see our failings not forbid,</L>
<L>Loosely run on in the vain Paths we did:</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Satyr,</HI> then, that is our truest Friend,</L>
<L>For none before they know their Faults can mend;</L>
<L>That tells us boldly of our foulest crimes,</L>
<L>Reproves ill manners, and reforms the Times:</L>
<L>How am I then too blame, when all I write</L>
<L>Is honest rage, not prejudice, or spight?</L>
<L><HI>Truth</HI> is my aim, with <HI>truth</HI> I shall impeach,</L>
<L>And I'll spare none that come within it's reach:</L>
<L>On then, my <HI>Muse,</HI> the <HI>World</HI> before thee lies,</L>
<L>And lash the <HI>Knaves</HI> and <HI>Fools</HI> that I despise.</L>

<P>THE pious Endeavours of the <HI>Gown</HI> have not prov'd more ineffectual towards reclaiming the Errors of a vitious Age, than <HI>Satyr</HI> (the better way, though less practised) the amendment of Honesty and good Manners among us: Nor is it a wonder, when we consider that <HI>Women</HI> (as if they had the Ingredi|ent of <HI>Fallen-Angel</HI> in their Composition) the more they are lash't, are but the more hardned in Impeni|tence: And as Children, in some violent Distemper, commonly spit out those cherishing Cordials, which, if taken, might chase away the Malady, so they (inspir'd, as 'twere, with a natural averseness to Vertue) despise that wholsome counsel, which is religiously design'd for their future good and happiness. Iudge, then, if <HI>Satyr</HI> ever had more need of a sharper sting than now, when he can look out of his <HI>Cell</HI> on no side, but sees so many Objects beyond the reach of Indignation. Nor is it altogether unreasonable for me (while others are lashing the Rebellious times into obedience) to have one fling at <HI>Woman,</HI> the original of Mischief. I am sensible, I might as well expect to see Truth and Ho|nesty uppermost in the World, as think to be free from the bitterness of their Resentments; But I have no reason to be concern'd at that; since, I'm certain, my design's as far from offending the good (if there are
<PB REF="89">
any among them that can be said to be so) as those few that are good wou'd be offended at their Reception into Bliss, to be there crown'd with the happy reward of their Labours. As for those that are ill, if it gall them, it succeeds according to my wish; for I have no other design but the amendment of Vice, which if I cou'd but, in the least, accomplish, I shou'd be well pleas'd, and not without reason too; for it must needs be some satisfaction to a young, unskilful <HI>Archer,</HI> to <HI>hit</HI> the first <HI>mark</HI> he ever aim'd at.</P>

<L>Can meet your Flames of Love with equal Fires;</L>
<L>She only damns the Soul; but an ill Wife</L>
<L>Damns that, and with it all the Joys of Life:</L>

<L>That of <HI>two ills</HI> the <HI>least</HI> is to be chose?</L>
<L>But now since Woman's <HI>Lust</HI> I chance to name,</L>
<L>Womans unbounded <HI>Lust</HI> I'll first proclaim:</L>
<L>And shew that our lewd Age has brought to view,</L>
<L>What <HI>Sodom,</HI> when at worst, had blush't to do.</L>
<L>True, I confess, that <HI>Rome's Imperial Whore</HI></L>
<L>(More fam'd for Vice than for the Crown she wore)</L>
<L>Into the publick Stews, disguis'd, wou'd thrust,</L>
<L>To quench the raging fury of her Lust;</L>
<L>And by such Actions bravely got her name</L>
<L>Born up for ever on the wings of Fame:</L>
<L><PB N="144" REF="91">Yet this is poor to what our <HI>Modern Age</HI></L>

<L>When all her Body was one <HI>putrid sore,</HI></L>
<L>Studded with <HI>Pox</HI> and <HI>Vlcers</HI> quite all o'er;</L>

<L>Unless Religion pious thoughts instil,</L>
<L>Shew me the Woman that wou'd not be ill,</L>

<L>The Actions that proceed from't must be so:</L>

<L><PB N="146" REF="92">That they wou'd have it so their Crime assures;</L>
<L>Thus, if they durst, all Women wou'd be Whores.</L>

<L>Forgive me, <HI>Modesty,</HI> if I have been,</L>

<L>How can you miss it when 'tis every where?</L>
<L>Some, through all hunted Nature's secrets trace</L>
<L>To fill the furrows of a wrinkled Face,</L>

<L>By some vain Fop I neither love, nor fear;</L>
<L>Who, in these words, his weakness does reveal,</L>

<L>That we can't gaze on his refulgent light,</L>

<L>How does the Winter look, that naked thing,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye biting <HI>Scorpions</HI> (for I've heard of such,</L>
<L>And as for <HI>Spleen</HI> I cannot have too much)</L>
<L>Aid me, I beg you, with inveterate spite,</L>
<L>Instruct me how to stab, each word I write;</L>

<L>Their <HI>Trade</HI> decay, and they unpity'd starve;</L>
<L>A better Fate than most of 'em deserve.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First to the <HI>Middle-Gallery</HI> we'll go,</L>
<L>(The <HI>Prologue</HI> to the Vice you'll find below)</L>
<L>Where reeking Punks like Summer Insects swarm,</L>
<L>And stink like <HI>Pole-cats</HI> when they're hunted warm:</L>
<L>Their very Scents cause <HI>Apoplectick Fits,</HI></L>
<L>And yet they're thought all <HI>Civet</HI> by the <HI>Cits.</HI></L>
<L>(But that's not much, for, the plain truth to tell,</L>
<L>They're without Brains, why not without their Smell?)</L>
<L>Here, every Night, they sit <HI>three hours</HI> for Sale,</L>
<L>With dirty <HI>Night-rail,</HI> and a dirtier <HI>Tayl</HI>:</L>
<L>If any <HI>Gudgeon</HI> bites, they have him sure,</L>
<L>For nothing Angles Blockheads like a Whore.</L>
<L>To keep their <HI>Masks</HI> on is their only way,</L>
<L>For going barefac't wou'd but spoil their Play;</L>
<L>Their <HI>Noses</HI> sharp as Needles, <HI>Eyes</HI> sunk in,</L>
<L>A wrinkl'd <HI>Forehead,</HI> and a parchment <HI>Skin:</HI></L>
<L>A Breath as hot as <HI>Aetna</HI>'s sulph'rous Fire,</L>
<L>And yet not half so hot as their <HI>desire.</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Physick</HI> each, at times, has swallow'd up</L>
<L>Wou'd stock the <HI>King's Apothecary's Shop.</HI></L>

<L>They have the knack to poison with perfume;</L>
<L>Our Strumpets now, those <HI>Factresses</HI> for death,</L>
<L>Will do't with one puff of their morning breath.</L>
<L>If drunk with <HI>Nants</HI> (as, by their smell, you'd think</L>
<L>They never tasted any other drink)</L>
<L>It mainly adds to what I've said before,</L>
<L>And makes 'em glory in their guilt the more;</L>
<L>Then let 'em have their will, and you shall see</L>
<L>How wild a thing unbounded Bitch will be:</L>
<L>No <HI>Pen</HI> can write, no human wit can think</L>
<L>The lewdness of a <HI>Play-House Punk</HI> in drink;</L>
<L>Inspir'd by Lust's Enthusiastick rage,</L>
<L>She'd prostitute her self ev'n on the Stage,</L>
<L>Strip naked, and, without a thought of shame,</L>
<L>Do things Hell's blackest Fiend wou'd blush to name.</L>
<L>Yet such as these our brawny <HI>Fops</HI> admire;</L>
<L>The fittest <HI>fewel</HI> for so hot a fire.</L>
<L>A <HI>Woman</HI>'s ne're so wicked, but she can</L>
<L>Find one as wicked, or much worse, in <HI>man,</HI></L>
<L>To satisfy her Lust, obey her will,</L>
<L>And, at her beck, perform the greatest ill:</L>
<L>These ride not Strumpets, but are Strumpet-rid,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Dogs,</HI> they'll fetch and carry if they're bid.</L>
<L>But now I talk of <HI>Dogs,</HI> did you e're meet</L>
<L>A <HI>proud Bitch</HI> and her Gallants in the street,</L>

<L>His Face for <HI>Farce</HI> nature at first design'd,</L>
<L>And matcht it too with as Burlesque a mind,</L>
<L>Made him pert, vain, a Maggot, vile, ill-bred,</L>
<L>And gave him <HI>heels of Cork,</HI> and <HI>brains of lead.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To speak 'em all were tedious to discuss,</L>
<L>But if you'l take 'em by the Lump, they're thus:</L>
<L>A pack of idle, pimping, spunging Slaves,</L>
<L>A Miscellany of Rogues, Fools and Knaves;</L>
<L>A Nest of Leachers, worse than <HI>Sodom</HI> bore,</L>
<L>And justly merit to be punish't more:</L>
<L>Diseas'd, in Debt, and every moment dun'd;</L>
<L>By all good Christians loath'd, and their own Kindred shun'd.</L>
<L>To say more of 'em wou'd be loss of time;</L>
<L>For it, with Justice, may be thought a Crime</L>
<L>To let such <HI>Rubbish</HI> have a place in <HI>Rhime.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now hear a wonder that will well declare</L>
<L>How extravagantly lewd some Women are:</L>
<L>For ev'n these men, base as they are and vain,</L>
<L>Our Punks of highest Quality maintain;</L>
<L><PB N="185" REF="111">Supply their daily wants (which are not slight)</L>
<L>But 'tis, that they may be supply'd at night.</L>
<L>These in their <HI>Coaches</HI> they take up and down,</L>
<L>Publish their foul disgrace o'er all the Town,</L>
<L>And seem to take delight it shou'd be known;</L>
<L>And known it shall be, in my pointed Rhimes</L>
<L>Stand Infamous to all succeeding Times.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It wou'd be endless to trace all the Vice</L>
<L>That from the <HI>Play-House</HI> takes immediate rise</L>
<L>It is the unexhausted <HI>Magazin</HI></L>
<L>That stocks the Land with Vanity and Sin:</L>
<L>As the <HI>New River</HI> does, from <HI>Islington,</HI></L>
<L>Through several Pipes supply ev'n half the Town&punc;</L>
<L>So the Luxurious lewdness of the <HI>Stage,</HI></L>
<L>Drain'd off, feeds half the <HI>Brothels</HI> of the Age.</L>
<L>Unless these ills, then, we cou'd regulate,</L>
<L>It ought not to be suffer'd in the <HI>State.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>More might be said; but by what's said, we see</L>
<L>'Tis the <HI>sum total</HI> of all Infamy,</L>
<L>And thence conclude, by flourishing so long</L>
<L>It has undone Numbers, both Old and Young;</L>
<L>That many hundred Souls are now unblest,</L>
<L>Which else had dy'd in Peace, and found eternal rest.</L>

<HEAD>TO THE Right Honourable CHARLES, EARL of Dorset and Middlesex, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE best Excuse the <HI>Author</HI> of a <HI>Dedication</HI> can make his Patron, is, in my Iudgment, to as|sure him he shall not be troubled with his future Impertinence. I have oft presum'd upon your Lordship's Good|ness, and can no otherwise make amends
<PB REF="114">
than by protesting this is the last time I shall offend you in this Nature. <HI>Poetry</HI> has hitherto been my <HI>Diver|sion</HI>; I must take care it does not en|croach upon my <HI>better Judgment,</HI> and oblige me to make it my <HI>business:</HI> in order to it, I here take a solemn and lasting leave of it: Your Lordship has set the Example. In your Youth <HI>Poesie,</HI> sometimes, snatch't a moment or two from your other <HI>Diversions,</HI> and never, indeed, did so small time produce so lovely an <HI>Issue</HI>; Whatever you writ was full of that <HI>Fancy, Wit</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> which made, and does yet make your <HI>Conversation,</HI> of all things, most desirable and charm|ing: but now grown to an age mature, more solid and sublime things are be|come the <HI>Favorites</HI> of your choice and
<PB REF="114">
study. <HI>Poetry</HI> shou'd never be en|tertain'd in a Man's Bosome, she may sometimes be admitted to make a Visit and away; her constant converse is vain and trivial: What <HI>Cowley</HI> says upon another occasion, I cou'd, methinks naturally adapt to my pre|sent thoughts of <HI>Poetry</HI>;
<Q><L>My Eyes are open'd and I see</L>
<L>Through the <HI>transparent Fallacy.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, to be always versifying, is to be always wasting the most pretious Gift of Heav'n, our Time, without so much as the pretence of Gain for an Excuse: But say that a Man were worthy of praise, and that his Writings really deserv'd it; yet that <HI>Chamelion diet</HI> is a little too
<PB REF="115">
thin for a <HI>Poet</HI>'s constitution; though I must confess, if 'twere possible to live upon <HI>Air,</HI> our <HI>Modern Rhimers</HI> wou'd find out the secret. But since 'tis not, 'tis time, my Lord, to take my leave of an <HI>unkind Mistress,</HI> and not with them doat on till I am in danger of starving.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, <SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE> <SIGNED><HI>Your Lordship's most humble And much obliged Servant,</HI> R. Gould.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>Advertisement.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have endeavour'd in this <HI>Poem</HI> to write as bold Truths as I cou'd, and, I hope, without offence to <HI>good Manners</HI>; Though some may imagine I have swerv'd from it in the <HI>Characters</HI> at the latter end of the <HI>Satyr:</HI> But I wou'd have the <HI>Critick</HI> know, that if there are really such Persons as be there describ'd, they ought to have the Reprehension there given: for where Folly and Knavery are so visible, I will be so much a Le|veller as to believe there ought to be no Respect of Persons. Twou'd be very unhappy for Rich Men, and a priviledge, I think, they ought not to boast of, if their <HI>Birth,</HI> or <HI>Wealth,</HI> shou'd exempt 'em from being told of their Errours. How|ever no Mans Reputation is injur'd; for, as I have said in the <HI>Satyr,</HI> (which to Iudicious Men will justify the honesty of my Intention.)
<Q><L>Tho' I shall lash their Fau'ts, I'll spare to name,</L>
<L>I but expose their <HI>Follies,</HI> not their <HI>Fame.</HI></L></Q></P>

<L>Cropt from your Stalks, like Flow'rs, in all your prime,</L>
<L>To languish, fade and dy before your time:</L>
<L>In vain the <HI>Nymph</HI> was faithful to her <HI>Mate,</HI></L>
<L>Your <HI>truth</HI> cou'd not protect you from your <HI>Fate</HI>;</L>
<L>Your truth, too cold to melt th' obdurate mind</L>
<L>Of Man, whose Nature is to be unkind:</L>

<LG>
<L><HI>Man</HI> is my Theme &mdash; but where shall I begin,</L>
<L>Where enter the vast Circle of his Sin?</L>
<L>Or how get out of it, when once I'm in?</L>
<L><HI>Man!</HI> who was made to govern all things, yet</L>
<L>No other Brute is govern'd with so little wit:</L>
<L>So oddly temper'd and so apt to stray,</L>
<L>There's not a Dog but's wiser in his way:</L>
<L>Thinks he sees all things, but so dim his Eye,</L>
<L>He's furthest off, when he believes he's nigh.</L>
<L>Pretends to Heav'n your Footsteps to convey,</L>
<L>Then raises <HI>Mists,</HI> and makes you lose your way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Slave to his Passions, every several lust</L>
<L>Whisks him about, as Whirlwinds do the dust:</L>
<L>And dust he is indeed, a senceless Clod,</L>
<L>That swells and struts, and wou'd be thought a God.</L>
<L>So selfish, insolent and vain, whene'r</L>
<L>In his gilt Coach the <HI>Pageant</HI> does appear,</L>
<L>He must be thought just, gen'rous, wise and brave,</L>
<L>Though a known Coxcomb, and a fearful Slave.</L>
<L>This shews us Fortune, in her giddy mood,</L>
<L>Rains bounty every where, but where she shou'd,</L>
<L>To merit false, and all that's good and brave,</L>
<L>But ever faithful to the <HI>Fool</HI> and <HI>Knave.</HI></L>
<L>Good Heav'n! that such shou'd have so little sense,</L>
<L>Yet, at the same time, so much Impudence,</L>
<L><PB N="197" REF="117">To think they bear more <HI>value</HI> than the rest,</L>
<L>Because they <HI>swear</HI> more, and go <HI>better drest</HI>;</L>
<L>Yet so it is, the gawdy Coxcomb's priz'd,</L>
<L>And the brave, thread-bare, honest Soul despis'd.</L>
<L>How vain is Man, and how perverse his will?</L>
<L>That may be good, and by his choice is ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where e'r <HI>Self-Interest</HI> calls, he's sure to go,</L>
<L>But never matters where 'tis just, or no:</L>
<L>Justice he laughs at, thinks there's no such tye,</L>
<L>So lives, so, like a Beast, designs to dy.</L>
<L>As greater Fish upon the lesser prey,</L>
<L>As <HI>Wolves</HI> on <HI>Sheep,</HI> that from the <HI>Shepherd</HI> stray,</L>
<L>So Man on Man pour out their rage and spite,</L>
<L>Make violence and rapine their delight,</L>
<L>Till with revenge they've gorg'd their Appetite.</L>
<L>Not bounded by <HI>Divine,</HI> or <HI>Humane Law,</HI></L>
<L>Too proud to humble, and too strong to aw.</L>
<L>They break the Bars <HI>nature</HI> her self has laid,</L>
<L>And every <HI>sacred Priviledge</HI> invade.</L>
<L>New Worlds of Vice he daily does explore;</L>
<L>His <HI>Sea</HI> of Villany's without a <HI>shore.</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n while he sleeps his dreams are full of blood,</L>
<L>And, waking, he resolves to make 'em good:</L>
<L>Or say against their Treachery you provide,</L>
<L>It is but having <HI>Power</HI> on their side,</L>
<L>And that does still to the same Centre draw,</L>
<L>Corrupt the Judge, and murder you by Law:</L>
<L>Witness the Crew that, late, exulting stood,</L>
<L>And wash't their impious hands in <HI>Royal Blood:</HI></L>
<L>If from their Subject's rage Kings are not free,</L>
<L>What must the Wretch expect of mean degree?</L>
<L><PB N="198" REF="118">Not in an Age he sees a happy hour,</L>

<L>Are forc'd to bend and crawl, and lick the dust.</L>
<L>How vain is Man, and how perverse his will,</L>
<L>That may be good, and chuses to be ill?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Deceitful, slothful, covetous and base,</L>
<L>A Devil's Intellect, an Angel's Face:</L>
<L>When e'r he smiles, 'tis then you shou'd beware,</L>
<L>To your assistance summon all your care,</L>
<L>Some specious Villany lies lurking there:</L>
<L>Which oft is drest in such a bright disguise,</L>
<L>The dazling Lustre does deceive the wise,</L>
<L>And wise men, too, are Villains oft themselves;</L>
<L>What <HI>Pilot</HI> so expert to 'scape these <HI>Rocks</HI> and <HI>Shelves?</HI></L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Friendship,</HI> which of old gain'd lasting Fame,</L>
<L>Is, in these latter times, nought but a name:</L>
<L>Who calls you <HI>Friend</HI> avoid, unless you know</L>
<L>Substantial Reason why he shou'd be so:</L>
<L>In that <HI>disguise</HI> all Villanies are done,</L>
<L>In that <HI>disguise</HI> they're hardest, too, to shun.</L>
<L>Husbands, who is it makes your Consorts Whores?</L>
<L>Your <HI>Friend,</HI> none else can come within your doors.</L>
<L>Who is it proves to Oath and Bond unjust?</L>
<L>Your <HI>Friend,</HI> your Enemies you never trust;</L>
<L>Or if you do, y' are very far from wise,</L>
<L>And <HI>Knave</HI> and <HI>Fool</HI> we equally despise.</L>
<L>Who is it does your secret Soul betray,</L>
<L>And bring your darkest thoughts to open day,</L>
<L><PB N="199" REF="118">Who is it, but your Friend? in whose false breast</L>
<L>You fondly thought they wou'd for ever rest.</L>
<L>The Heart of Man is to it self untrue,</L>
<L>And why shou'd you expect it just to you?</L>
<L>Friendships, at best, are but like Brush-wood fire,</L>
<L>Shine bright a while, and in a blaze expire.</L>
<L>How vain is Man, and how perverse his will?</L>
<L>He may be good, and by his <HI>choice</HI> is ill!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who protests most let him be least believ'd,</L>
<L>For 'tis by such w' are sure to be deceiv'd.</L>
<L>Ev'n I my self once thought I had a <HI>Friend,</HI></L>
<L>For boundless was the love he did pretend:</L>
<L>Riches he did not want, he rowl'd in Coin,</L>
<L>Which he oft swore was no more <HI>his</HI> than <HI>mine:</HI></L>
<L>He wou'd do nothing without my advice,</L>
<L>Friendship's best sign, for no <HI>true Friend</HI> is <HI>Nice.</HI></L>
<L>I too ador'd him with so bright a Flame,</L>
<L>Angel to Angel cou'd but do the same.</L>
<L>At his approach all lesser Joys took flight,</L>
<L>Ev'n Women I contemn'd; he was the <HI>light</HI></L>
<L>That rul'd the <HI>day,</HI> they did but rule the <HI>night.</HI></L>
<L>And that too oft&mdash; upon his gentle Breast</L>
<L>My Cares, and every anxious thought took rest.</L>
<L>It happn'd once that I was low of store;</L>
<L>(It is no wonder Poets shou'd be poor)</L>
<L>In this afflicted State, 'twas no small Bliss</L>
<L>I was assur'd of such a Friend as this:</L>
<L>On him, said I, on him I may depend,</L>
<L>I cannot need so much, as he will lend;</L>
<L>He will be proud his Constancy is try'd: &mdash;</L>
<L>I ask't him, and, by Heav'n, I was deny'd!</L>
<L><PB N="200" REF="119">And ne'r since then will he so much as greet,</L>
<L>Nay not take notice of me when we meet;</L>
<L>But, when he sees me, turns away his Eye,</L>
<L>Or with proud scorn does walk regardless by.</L>
<L>Traytor to Friendship! may thy spotted Name</L>
<L>Stand branded here with everlasting shame.</L>
<L>But 'tis no wonder, search and you will find</L>
<L>The same Ingratitude through all Mankind:</L>
<L>Not Madmen, when they're in their raving fit,</L>
<L>Nor the pert Fop, that wou'd be thought a wit,</L>
<L>Reciting Poet, or Illiterate Cit;</L>
<L>Not flutt'ring Officers, at Mid-night drunk,</L>
<L>That scowr the street in the pursuit of Punk,</L>
<L>Nor ought, be it as horrid as it can,</L>
<L>Is more avoided than the Borrowing Man!</L>
<L>How vain is Man, and how perverse his will,</L>
<L>That may be good, and chuses to be ill?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Reader,</HI> I write not this to make thee lend,</L>
<L>Unless y'are sure 'tis to a real Friend,</L>
<L>If you doubt that, hear not what he entreats;</L>
<L>For <HI>one</HI> that's honest there's <HI>ten thousand</HI> cheats:</L>
<L>Why then shou'd any be so vain to trust,</L>
<L>When 'tis such odds, the <HI>Debtor</HI> proves unjust?</L>
<L>A Friend's a Friend, and so he shou'd be us'd,</L>
<L>But think <HI>two Men</HI> your Friends, you'll be abus'd.</L>
<L>The Vows of Men are of the britlest kind,</L>
<L>Lighter than Children's Bubbles drove by wind,</L>
<L>Vary all Colours, blown so thin and weak,</L>
<L>As if, like them, just made for sport to break.</L>
<L>How prone to promise, and how false of heart</L>
<L>Women best know, for they have felt the smart:</L>

<L>No Vice so distant, but within his view,</L>

<L>Treason's a Trifle, 'tis a frequent thing</L>

<L>In short, so much Man's violence prevails,</L>
<L>Our <HI>Churches</HI> must be made as strong as <HI>Iayls.</HI></L>

<L>When Man by active Games was hardy made;</L>

<L>This modest Creature, this <HI>Black-Angel Saint,</HI></L>
<L>She has install'd her Bosom Confidant:</L>
<L>And the chief Reason why she this prefers,</L>
<L>Because her Vice goes hand in hand with hers.</L>

<L>Their Pedigree is blazon'd on their Face.</L>
<L>Vain, rude, ill-bred, the scandal of their kind,</L>

<L>Ah! thus too long I thought, and was too soon deceiv'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain we toyl and labour to be blest,</L>
<L>And with a swarm of thoughts our minds mo|lest;</L>
<L>We grasp but Air when e're we reach at <HI>rest:</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>slippery Wanton</HI> sometimes comes in sight,</L>
<L>But in a moment mounts and takes her endless flight;</L>
<L>And in ascending cries, There is no Peace</L>
<L>In City, Country, Waining, or Increase,</L>
<L>Till <HI>weary Life</HI> does <HI>end,</HI> and all our Labours <HI>cease.</HI></L>

<L>By sad Experience, now, I find the Swain</L>
<L>Is worse than Heathen, more a Slave to gain:</L>
<L><PB N="309" REF="173">His dullness but a politick disguise</L>
<L>To cheat those <HI>Coxcombs</HI> that believe they're wise:</L>
<L>Though not so fine, or florid as the <HI>Cit,</HI></L>
<L>His <HI>brutish Cunning</HI> baulks the other's <HI>Wit.</HI></L>
<L>For, like the <HI>Town,</HI> the <HI>Country</HI>'s Custom's Slave,</L>
<L>More full of <HI>Fool,</HI> and quite as full of <HI>Knave:</HI></L>
<L>And though Vice here is not so frequent known,</L>
<L>Because the Inhabitants are thinner sown,</L>
<L>Yet let regard to <HI>Quantity</HI> be had,</L>
<L>Drop Man for Man, and they are e'en as bad.</L>
<L>Half void of Reason, and quite void of Shame;</L>
<L>Before they know the <HI>Person,</HI> or his <HI>Name,</HI></L>
<L>They shall expose, and gibbet up his Fame.</L>
<L>Since a <HI>good name</HI>'s so pretious, of all wrongs,</L>
<L>The worst is suffering from malitious Tongues,</L>
<L>Which prove all Tortures end not with our Breath;</L>
<L>For an <HI>ill Tongue</HI> can wound us <HI>after Death.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now what Relief? &mdash; yes, I Relief may get,</L>
<L>If I cou'd trace th' Example <HI>you</HI> have set:</L>
<L>For seldom, in <HI>that Function,</HI> have I found;</L>
<L>In all things, One so <HI>Orthodox</HI> and <HI>sound.</HI></L>
<L>Cou'd I, like you, be <HI>Master</HI> of my <HI>Will,</HI></L>
<L>Keep guard on every thought that's prone to ill;</L>
<L>Be ever studious of the <HI>publick Good</HI></L>
<L>(As every true-born worthy Subject shou'd.)</L>
<L>Stand fast ev'n now when Popery does prevail,</L>
<L>And, but for such as You, wou'd turn the Scale.</L>
<L>Cou'd I (were I as able in my store)</L>
<L>With the same liberal hand relieve the <HI>Poor</HI>;</L>
<L><PB N="310" REF="174">Suppress all vain, inordinate desires,</L>
<L>And clip the Wings of Love's fantastick Fires:</L>
<L>T' <HI>Apostasie</HI> and Errour be severe,</L>
<L>And make the vertuous <HI>Man</HI> as much my care:</L>
<L>Cou'd I be thus, and still be cheerful, gay,</L>
<L>And just (as Heav'n avert but that I may)</L>
<L>I need not <HI>value</HI> what the <HI>envious</HI> say;</L>
<L>Dauntless I'd stand their rage, and take the Field;</L>
<L>When <HI>Vertue</HI>'s our <HI>Impenetrable Shield,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>Devil, Flesh</HI> and their loose <HI>Agents</HI> yield.</L>
