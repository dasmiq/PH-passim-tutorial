<HEAD>To that little Flock in and about the County of <HI>Hartford,</HI> the Author sends Greeting.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I take a View of the Wonderfulness of Gods Providence in bringing me first among you, together with those Bonds of Love, by which I am held so fast, that it is my quoti|dian and daily study, how I may be further capacitated to serve you, and the Church of my Lord Iesus; Verily, I must confess, you are the People that have all my thoughts: And besides this, you are those who have the greatest interest in my Prayers; Others have some of my heart, but next to God you have all my heart, I have heard much of the love of a Minister to his People, as that I could scarce give credit unto
<PB REF="3">
it; but I do now believe it, because Ex|perience has taught me so, though that by which I am obliged unto you is not the same as with a Minister and his People, it being only a sincere Love be|gotten by my frequent, painful and la|borious Preaching unto you, without any further charge, and yet notwith|standing how do I love you, and pray for your happiness in this World, and the World to come; I can't endure to think of your damnation, no, not any of you. I am sick at the heart (many times) through fear, lest I should rise up in judgement against some of you, because there are those amongst you, that seem to takeiittle notice of God, Christ, and their immortal souls, though through grace all of you are not molested with the Contagion of this Distem|per, which is so Epidemical, not on|ly in foreign Places, but likewise in our <HI>English</HI> Island, as that it doth ma|ny times occasion Floods of Tears to run down from the eyes of Gods precious Servants, who, as so many
<PB REF="3">
<HI>Lots,</HI> do bewail the iniquities of this Land. Sirs, I have thought good to reach you with my Pen, when my Tongue cannot; and hence it is, that I dedicate this unto you in part, though it is possible I could have found out many others, whose Names I might affix in the Frontispiece of this Book, only my Love is most endeared to you; and wherefore do you think it is, that I should concern my self so much with you; would you know, take then these few Reasons.</P>
<P>First, because God made me not al|together for my self, but for you and others; we were not made for our selves, and therefore we act most like beasts, when we only minde our selves, and not others, who are our Kinsfolk, according to Creation; but when that goodness that is in us is so diffu|sive, as that it leads us forth to suc|cour those who srand in need of our help, then we act as our selves, and like rational creatures, it is God that created me, and why did he create me, but that I should serve him, and in what
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page"><PB REF="4">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page"><PB REF="4">
<PB REF="5">
better way can I do it, then in the first place to seek my own salvation, and after that, the salvation of you and others. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, the End of my Creation is not all by which I am induced to concern my self thus with you, but likewise the End of my Redemption requires me so to do; I, you, and all of us were no sooner created, but we fell from God; and through Adhe|rence to the Devil, lost that glorious Image which he had invested us with, and thereby forfeited the favour of God, and so became the Children of Wrath; but now Iesus Christ, that immaculate and spotless Lamb of God, who knew no sin, became sin for us, by assuming the humane nature, and taking upon him the guilt of all our transgressions, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53.6. How then can I, you, or any of us, be slothful in Gods service, when he hath done so much for all of us as he hath done; May we not say as <HI>Bernard</HI> did con|cerning Christ,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Dilexisti me Do|mine ma|gis quam <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">ipsum.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Thou hast loved me, Oh Lord, more then thy self!</HI> And
<PB REF="5">
now the End wherefore Christ did all this was, that we might be restored to Gods Image again, and to serve him in all manner of holiness; And in no better way can I do this, then in look|ing after my own soul and the souls of others.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the End of my Redempti|on doth not only require me thus to concern my self with you, but likewise the End of my Sanctification.</P>
<P>I am sanctified (as I hope) and am washed with the water of Regene|ration. Now it is the duty of those who are sanctified, to lead other in the way to Sanctification and obedience of the Spirit; This our Saviour lays down as a Rule to <HI>Peter,</HI> That when he was converted,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 22.32.</NOTE> he should strengthen his Brethren. But</P>
<P>Fourthly, the very End of my Mi|nistry requires me to have a diligent care of your souls; 'Tis a duty of us who are Preachers of the Gospel, to pity and look after poor souls that are in their blood; and God, yea, An|gels and my own Conscience do bear
<PB REF="6">
me witness how I pity your souls, and that I could go hundreds of Miles barefoot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o do any of you good, though never so mean in life and descent; I was devoted from the Womb to the Ministry; and now when I come forth unto it, shall I not in any wise answer the end thereof, the Lord for|bid.</P>
<P>Fifthly and lastly, not onely the End of my Creation, Redemption, Sanctification and Ministry; but like|wise the end of my Preservation doth thus oblige me to you: Hath God done for me what he hath done, and shall I not to the utmost do what I can for him; Hath he wrought such deliverances for me, and shall I be slack and negligent in his service, far be it from me, and all those who have experienced the like that I have; And hath he more|over kept me hitherto, and must I not seek his glory; to such perverse walk|ing the Lord put an end: Many o|ther Obligations there are, by which
<PB REF="6">
I am bound to look after you; (<HI>viz.</HI>) I am a dying Creature, and therefore whilst I have life I must act for God, because when I am in the Grave I cannot write unto you, My Preach|ing-Work then will be over; And h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce it is, that I do think it meet, whilst I am in this earthly Ta|bernacle, to put you in mind of these things, and to stirr you up to the doing thereof; And as the consi|deration of my Mortality should move me to do what I can for God; and you see likewise the consideration of yours should make you more willing to hear and re|ceive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Post mor|tem nulla Paeniten|tia.</NOTE> what I and others do both Preach and write unto you.</P>
<P>And now, Sirs, what remains, but that you would follow those Pra|ctical things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christi re|vere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se Tri|bunal.</NOTE> which the good Spirit of God may by these Lines put you in minde of; Consider, you must one day render an Account for all the good Sermons that you have heard; the Word will either prove a
<PB REF="7">
savour of life, or of death; you will either be the better for Sermons, or the worse, and therefore to you now I speak, that have often heard the voci|feration of the Gospel, but are not as yet reformed; Consider, af|ter Death comes Iudgment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scio Domi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Iesu quod districtus ar|biter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mnium ven|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urus clandestina hominum facta &amp; verba cogit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ta in lucem proferes.</HI> G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rhard de extre|mo judicio.</NOTE> and then what will you do, will you not wish that you had taken the good Counsel of God given by his Mini|sters, will you not then re|member these Sermons which once you, forgot as soon as ever you went out out of the Church, and will not the remembrance thereof be as a Worm gnawing of your Con|sciences in Hell,</P>
<P>Oh with what shame and confusion will ye then be cloathed, when all those secret sins, which you thought were impossible to be brought to light, shall be made manifest before the Lord Ie|sus, who is (<GAP DESC="foreign">) light it self. Moreover, consider that without you have an Advocate, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is no standing
<PB REF="7">
at this Tribunal, and who is this Ad|vocate, but Iesus Christ will plead to the utmost for you, if you can but make sure of him, for without him nothing can be done, in order to your being sheltred from that wrath of God, which then shall be revealed on all those who have slighted this Advocate, and have accounted Sermons of no worth, further believe and consider, that if you have not the Lord Iesus to stand as your friend, you must be thrust down into Hell, and there howl with the damned for ever: And what think you now of these things, do you stedfastly be|lieve them; if you do not, search the Scriptures, and there you will finde what I have said to be true; if you do believe them, why then do some of you live, as if there were neither God, Heaven, Hell or Iudgement; if these things are sincerely believed by you, stir up then, and lay hold upon God, and claim of him deliverance from wrath to come, for it is hastning apace, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto you if you lay up nothing
<PB REF="8">
against this burning wrath of God for the time to come, is as sure as the time that is present, why there|fore are you all for the present time, assure your selves, that the walking in repulse against these Considerati|ons, and the sweet motions of the Spi|rit will make you smart one day. But</P>
<P>Finally, if you will all observe these things to do them, what a blessed Meeting shall we have, how wide will the Gates of Heaven stand open for u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? what a Welcom will God the Father give us, the very thoughts of it doth glad my very heart and soul; Suffer there|fore the good Word of God to take Impression upon you; Endeavor to live a life of Grace here, that so you may live a Life of Glory here|after; Persevere in all good, hold out to the end, for the Crown will make amends for all: Be constant in the use of means; Follow Peace with all men, be useful in your se|veral

<P><HI>Now the Arguments to prove the same, are deduced and taken from.</HI> 1. <HI>The efficient causes of the Scriptures,</HI> viz. <HI>Men, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Calling, Miss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and Insperation of whom was divine.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Yes, that I deny not, but the thing which I aim at is to shew, that the Au|thority and Truth of the Scriptures can be made apparent, from Gods Spirit, and from themselves, without the help of the Church, which assertion does contradict the Papist, who does au|daciously affirm, that the Authority of the Scriptures do absolutely depend up|on the Church, the absurd consequen|ces of which opinion are these.</HI> 1. <HI>Of

all, to hold that the Scriptures has no more Authority, but what the Vniversal consent of the Church gives unto it, is to make the Scriptures no otherwise, but a Nose of Wax, yea, it is to make the eter|nal and inviolable truth of God, rest up|on the pleasure of men; verily the matter and scope of the Scriptures is to be denied and to be of no use at all, if this opinion is right, these and such like are the Ab|surdities that must of necessity be held by retaining opinions of this kind.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The Papist do give a false interpre|tation upon his words, if we do but con|sider the whole tenor of his writing.

could not otherwise be brought to em|brace the Gospel for the assured truth of God, but by this that he was over|come with the Authority of the Church.

<P>AS Concerning this young man, being so willing to defer his Re|pentance unto an old Age, was the main Suggestion, which did keep him off from Closing with Jesus Christ (of whom is shadowes in this Dia|logue, and signified by <HI>Paulus</HI>) to|gether with his beleeving that God was more glorified by an old Con|vert, than by a young one, but when you come to understand how God dealt with this young man in bring|ing him off from all those letts and Impediments, by which he was kept from Closing with Christ, you will admire, it being in form following.</P>
<P>This young Man, as aforesaid, be|ing much molested with Temptati|ons of that kinde; One day above the rest, a Small-coal man going a|long
<PB N="52" REF="37">
the streets, did measure some thereof unto a Customer, who ha|ving no sooner done it, but he im|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">tely fell down dead, (although he was as well as I am now at this pre|sent writing) which being noised a|broad, and many coming to see him, he made one; who seeing him to lie dead on the ground, was ama|zed, especially when he understood the suddenness thereof.</P>
<P>Thus, after a little Contemplation upon him, he goes home; falling down upon his knees, saying to God, Lord have mercy upon me; and this was all he could say for an hour together, (somtimes it was) Lord have mercy upon me a sinner, and pardon my sins; thus continuing for the space of many weeks, despair|ing of Gods mercy to his soul; and being also convinced of his former ignorance, he is now glad to receive good Counsel from any body, his minde and will being changed, makes him to believe, that there is salvation only in Christ, and looks now upon
<PB N="53" REF="37">
all his duties, (as a <HI>Pauls</HI> in|deed) accounting them but dross and dung compar'd with our Lord Christ.</P>
<P>But one day more than the rest, praying to God, does earnestly beg of him for a pardon of all his sins; Thus Expostulating with God for the attainment thereof, <HI>Lord,</HI> (saith he,) <HI>Thou hast given a Pardon unto some, and why not unto me? what way and course therefore may I take for the obtainment of the same</HI>; and immediately at his request, (after the performance of duty) the Lord was pleased to give in this Text of Scripture, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.7. <HI>Let the wick|ed for sake his way, and the unrighte|ous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon</HI>; from hence he gathers hopes of Gods mercy unto his soul, but in temptations his hopes vanished a|way again; as to those other Scriptures

<P>O Most Glorious and Gracious Lord God, from everlasting to everlasting thou art the great Creator of Heaven and Earth, and the wise Disposer of all things which thou hast made; We the most unworthiest of all thy servants, do desire to prostrate our selves before thy Divine Majesty, under an humble acknowledgment of thy Goodness, thy Grace, thy Truth and Faithfulness: thy many mercies renew|ed &amp; continued every day to us, and our great unworthiness of the least of them: We are not worthy of the crumbs that fall from thy Table; not only because we were born in sin, but because we have liv'd in sin, and have daily added to our sinnes, by the vanity of our thoughts, words and actions, and the unsu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ableness of the whole man to all
