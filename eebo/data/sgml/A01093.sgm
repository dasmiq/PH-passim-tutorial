Secretary to the Kings Maiestie, and of his
most Honorable Priuie Councell; all Happi|nesse,
answerable to his Vertue and

<P>_MOST worthy Syr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> you cannot but remem|ber,
that, from the first beginning of our old
acquaintance, I haue alwayes made you the
<HI>Aristarchus</HI> of my writings. The exactnesse
of whole iudgement; I haue euer found, so
pleasingly tempered, with <HI>Sharp,</HI> and <HI>Sweet,</HI>
that, to the one of these, your <HI>sharpenesse,</HI> in discerning the least
escapes and errors, there could nothing more be added: of the
other, your <HI>sweetnesse,</HI> in pardoning the greatest, there could
nothing more be required. The recordation of which mixture,
hath giuen me now the boldnesse (notwithstanding the great|nesse
of your affaires, wherewith I euer find you pressed) yet, to
offer vnto your censure, this vnperfect worke, as matter of con|templation,
for your more reserued time: wherein, I nothing
doubt, but you haue your oft returnes, to meditations of this
kind. The heads which I haue proiected, in this worke to be
discussed, are all of them such, as though most needefull to be
beleeued; yet least laboured in by <HI>Diuines,</HI> to further our be|leefe;
and therefore the most subiect, both to question and
doubting: Especially, with men of the sharpest witts, the grea|test
spirits, and the richest endowments: whom Nature hath
prepared, for the search of the highest; and most difficult mat|ters.
<PB REF="3">
These men (out of the penetrating and diuiding nature of
their firie wits) doe trouble themselues with many Quaere's
and doubts, in all these <HI>foure Positions</HI> which neuer creepe into
the heads of simpler and vnlearned persons; framing some|times
such Obiections, as to which, they themselues cannot
giue good and sufficient Answeres, but are, <HI>ipsi sibi respondentes,
inferiores:</HI> as it was sayd of <HI>Chrysippus;</HI> euen for this very cause.
For the better helpe of which men, and to rid them out of the
snares of their owne curiosities, wherewith they oftentimes
intangle themselues; and to preuent, that they doe not, <HI>ipsi se
compungere suis acuminibus, that they wound not themselues, with
the sharpe needles points of their owne pricking wits;</HI> I haue done
the best I could, to ioyne my helpe with theirs, by answering
all Obiections, which I could coniecture might any way trou|ble,
their <HI>sciences,</HI> or <HI>Consciences.</HI> For this so meane a worke, I
affect no great Patronage. <HI>Satis&punc; magnum alter alteri the atrum su|mus.</HI>
Your loue is the greatest: which I haue euer found ready
to couer my greatest: wants. The summitie of my ambition is,
that, as you haue giuen a noble testimony vnto the world, of
the incomparable faithfulnesse of your loue towards me: so I
might yeeld a returne of my like fidelity of thankefulnesse to|ward
you. Your gracious acceptance of this mine imperfect
worke, shall be a brazen wall vnto mee, against the maleuo|lous

<HEAD>The Preface to the Reader, expressing the
Reason of the whole Worke.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_IT is not so much of mans owne free election, as of
Gods speciall disposition, that euery man in his wri|ting,
is particularly addicted vnto the handling of
this or that Argument. Not all vnto one: for so, all
but one, should be left vnhandl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd the world of
many excellent knowledges bereaued: but some
vnto one, and some vnto another; that we might not lacke instruction
in any profitable matter.</HI>
<Q><L>Diversis etenim gaudet Natura ministris,</L>
<L>Vt fieri diversa queant ornantia Terras.</L>
<L>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> patitur cunctos ad eandem curreremetam,</L>
<L>Sed varias iubet ire vias, varios&abque; labores</L>
<L>Suscipere, vt vario cultu sit pulchrior orbis,</L></Q>
<HI>Saith the Christian Poet:</HI>
<Q><L>Nature herselfe delights herselfe in sundry instruments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aling. in Scor. pag. 217.</NOTE></L>
<L>That sundry things be done to deck the Earth with Ornaments.</L>
<L>Nor suffers she her seruants all should runne one single race,</L>
<L>But will's the walke of euery one frame in a diuers pace:</L>
<L>That diuers wayes and diuers works the world might better grace.</L></Q>
<HI>Yea, and euen the very Heathen doe likewise confesse, this to be the
proper worke of Gods gracious prouidence; calling euery man to that
wherein he best foreseeth him, most able to doe good: and yet, not in|forcing,
but inducing him to doe it.</HI> Eam enim mentem Dij singulis
dant, vt communes vtilitates in medium afferant; <HI>saith the Atheni|an

That God had put into his mind to make that present Oration,
for the generall good of the whole Greekish Nation: <HI>ascribing
that his inclination, not vnto his owne selfe-motion; but vnto Gods

likewise doth</HI> Galen <HI>of his booke</HI> De vsu partium:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Galen lib. 10 de Vsu partium, p, 313.</NOTE> Deus aliqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
iussit, &amp; primum scribere, &amp; declarationem eius, ille ipse novit
me scire: <HI>ascribing all his writing vnto Gods inward commanding:
who knew best his ability to write of that argument. Which is indeed, a
very true ascription: yea, and much truer in spirituall matters, than it
is in any ciuill. For, therein it is most euident, that,</HI> The same Spirit,
that hath giuen to euery man his gift, hath also assigned vnto
euery man his taske:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 12. 4. 5. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>calling one vnto one Argument, and another
to another; and euery one to serue his Church, with those <GAP DESC="foreign"> and
graces, which he hath bestowed vpon him for that purpose. And this
we may plainely see, euen in those holy Instruments, that haue been the
writers of the holy</HI> Scriptures: <HI>how, as God had endowed them with
their seueral gifts, so he likewise appointed them to their seueral works:
calling some of them to the writing a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> holy Histories, <HI>as</HI> Moses, Io|shua,
&amp;c. <HI>some, of heauenly</HI> Mysteries, <HI>as</HI> Daniel, Iohn, &amp;c. <HI>some, of</HI>
Hymnes, <HI>as</HI> Dauid <HI>in</HI> Psalmes, <HI>and</HI> Salomon <HI>in his</HI> Song: <HI>some, of</HI>
Prophecies, <HI>as</HI> Isaj, Ieremie, &amp;c. <HI>and some, of</HI> Morall, and Ciuill
Precepts, <HI>as</HI> Salomon <HI>in his</HI> Prouerbs: <HI>euery one entertaining both
a different matter, and handling the same in a differing manner: yet
not by his owne election, but by Gods direction. For (as</HI> S. Peter <HI>plam|lyteacheth
vs)</HI> There is no Prophecy in Scripture, of any priuate
motion, neither of the will of man:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Pet&punc; 1. 20&punc; 21.</NOTE> but the holy men of God
did onely speake, as they were inspired by the holy Spirit: <HI>who
disposed their affections, to serue the Church of God, with all their best
indowments and endeauors; and euery one of them (according to that
Talent, which God hath giuen vnto him) to helpe to build it vp, in
true piety and religion. So that, they all of them being ioynt-laborers
together, and all of them working in one common worke, vnder one
common master, there could none haue any cause to insult ouer another&punc;
not the</HI> Hymnographer <HI>ouer the</HI> Historiographer, <HI>nor the</HI> Gnomo|grapher
<HI>ouer either, nor the</HI> Prophet <HI>ouer all, or any of the rest; but
euery one to acknowledge other, as his owne fellow-labourer, appoyn|ted
by God himselfe, with that gift which he had, to helpe forwarde the
same building that he himselfe did.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And, the very same course hath the holy Ghost obserued, as well in
<PB REF="4">
the new Testament, as he did in the old:</HI> For he hath giuen vnto his
Church, some Apostles, some Prophets, some Teachers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 12. 28.</NOTE> some
Workers of Myracles, some Helpers, some Gouernours, some
Speakers with Tongues. For the gathering together of the
Saints; for the worke of the Ministery, and for the building vp
of the body of Christ. Not all Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 11. 12.</NOTE> not all Prophets, not all
Teachers, not all Gouernours, <HI>but yet, all fellow-labourers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1, Cor. 3. 9.</NOTE> <HI>and all
builders vp of the Church, and euery one acoadiutor to the worke of
all the other.</HI> We together are Gods labourers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3. 9.</NOTE> <HI>and the Church</HI> his
building.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">odoret. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r. 6. de Prouide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, To. 2. p, 600.</NOTE> <HI>So that, as in the natur all body of a man, no one member can
suffice for all his need full vses; but, all of them stand in neede of the
mutuall assistance of all their fellow-members:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 12. 19. 21.</NOTE> <HI>so that,</HI> the eye cannot
say to the hand, I haue no neede of thee; no, nor euen the head
vnto the foote, I haue no neede of thee: <HI>So likewise, in the mysti
call body of Christ, those members that are the chiefest, yet doe neede
the coassistance of those that are the meanest.</HI></P>
<P>The same <HI>Prouidence</HI> (still carefull for the good of the Church)
hath continually raysed vp, throughout all succeeding ages, many lear|ned,
and wise, and industrious Pastors, to instruct and teach his Church,
in true piety and godlinesse: some by preaching, some by writing, and
some by both. But yet, in no Age, hath God shed out all the riches of his
blessings, both of <HI>Wisedome,</HI> and <HI>Learning,</HI> and all his <HI>high Illumi|nations,</HI>
more graciously and plentifully, than in this Age of ours. For,
what learning, or what knowledge hath God euer bestowed vpon any
of all the preceding ages, which he hath not greatly amplified and inlar|ged
in this of ours? Yea, and that to high degrees.</P>
<P>And, as he hath in this our Age, bestowed vpon many men, great
variety of Gifts, so hath hee also designed them to great variety of
workes. To some he hath giuen <HI>diuersitie of Tongues,</HI> and those hee
hath called to examine <HI>Translations:</HI> to some, skill in disputing, and
those he hath called to labour in <HI>Controuersies:</HI> to some, a faculty in
Exhortation and Teaching, and those he hath called to instruct men by
Preaching. And thus, as God hath dispensed his gifts diuersly; so hath
he assigned men their Prouinces accordingly: to one after one manner,
and to another after another; appoynting vnto euery one, that, <HI>as he
hath receiued the gift,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 7. 7.</NOTE> <HI>so likewise,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 4. 10.</NOTE> <HI>he should minister as good
dispensers of the manifold graces of God.</HI></P>
<P>So that, now (God be praysed) the Church of Christ goeth vp on all
<PB REF="5">
hands, euery man labouring in it with his seuerall gift, to repaire all the
ruines and seuerall bracks of it: some as <HI>Architects</HI> and <HI>skilfull Ma|ster-builders;</HI>
some, as Carpenters: some, as Smiths; some, as Ma|sons,;
yea, and some other, but as Temperers of Lyme and Mortar:
yet these also called <HI>Labourers; yea,</HI> and more properly then the o|thers.
Whose worke, though in view, it be lesse honorable then therest;
yet, is it in vse, as profitable as the best: yea, and of so great necessity,
to the perfecting of the building; that, as in temporall building, the
greater Stones cannot be firmely layd, without mixture of the lesse: so,
in this spirituall building too; those other Artes, though superiour, yet
cannot either perfect or performe their owne worke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lapides magos <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ine paruis, ben&egrave; struinegant Ar|chitecti. Plat. li. 10. de Leg. p. 877</NOTE> without the helpe
and ministery, euen of those meane and inferiour.</P>
<P>Amongst whom, it hath pleased the prouidence of God, to call mee,
to make vp some decayes in the foundations, which, either through
tract of time, or through corruption of manners, or through the vnder-mining
of little Foxes, mentioned in the <HI>Canticles,</HI> are growne by de|grees,
into the very lowest ground-works.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 2. 15.</NOTE> I am called to vnder-pinne
those foure maine Corner-stones, which vphold (like foure pillars) the
whole frame of the Church. I meane, the first, foure principles of all
Religion: namely, <HI>That there is a God. That there is but one
God. That Iehovah our God, is that one God.</HI> And, <HI>That the
holy Scripture is the word of that God.</HI> These vnder-groundworks,
hath it pleased diuine prouidence, to assigne me for my taske. So
that, whilst other men doe so are aloft, like Eagles in the ayre; I must
creepe heere below, like a worme vpon the earth. But yet, let no man
despise the basenesse of this worke; because it is about the <HI>Basis</HI> of the
Church. For, the worke of the foundation, though it be in sight, the low|est
worke belonging to the building, yet, is it not the least, but in truth,
the very greatest; as being the whole support and stay of all the rest,
euen of the very highest: A Worke which requireth both the skilful|lest
head, and the cunningest hand, vnto the doing of it; if it be done
as it ought.</P>
<P>And therefore, I could haue wished, that some excellent Maister|workman,
more plentifully abounding, both in leisure, and learning,
would haue taken it vponhim. The worke is due to such:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 3. 10.</NOTE> yea, and our
Church hath store of such (Gods name be praysed for it.) But yet, no
man (that I see) hath set his hand vnto it. Many worke vpon the
walls, to make them firme and strong: many vpon the roofe, to keepe
<PB REF="5">
it close and tight: many vpon the pillars, to erect and straighten
them exactly, <HI>ad perpendiculum:</HI> some pariete and smooth it: some
painte and adorne it; some furnish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Orat. 3. in Verrem. p. 79.</NOTE> and garnish it with beautifull pic|tures,
<HI>like apples of gold, in pictures of siluer.</HI> But yet, no man
looketh downe into the ground-worke of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 25. 11.</NOTE> that it be layd so low, as to
reach vnto the Rocke. Whereby there is a space left, for pioners and
vnder-miners, and such like deceitfull workers, which are not able to
breake through the wall, yet do dig vnder the foundation, and so to e|uert
all. And therefore I haue aduentured vpon this great taske, though
farre vnequall to it; hoping that the the <HI>same Spirit</HI> which hath giuen
me <HI>the will,</HI> will also assist me in the worke, in some measure, to per|forme
it. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Sorte diuinaid recte efficere quis&abque; potest, ad quod
Musa quempiam incitauit.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Ionc, p. 171.</NOTE> And so I haue followed the aduice of the
Poet:
<Q><L>Quin, hortante Deo, magnis insistere rebus</L>
<L>Incipe&mdash;</L>
<L>Why then, beginne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tibul. leb. 4. p. 150.</NOTE> sith ayde from God is sent&punc;</L>
<L>Proceede, goe on, dri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e forth thy great intent.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>A Worke, great indeede: yea, and that of much greater, both</HI> Diffi|cultie,
and Variety, and Vtility, and Necessity, <HI>then will easily, at
the first, bee conceiued of many: of all which foure, I will giue you a
little taste, in order.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Difficulty</HI> of the worke, ariseth from hence, that this Argument
now intended to be handled by me, is the most deserted part of all <HI>The|ologie;</HI>
and wherein the fewest <HI>Diuines</HI> haue bestowed their paines.
For, whereas there be but two wayes, to bring men vnto the know|ledge
and vnderstanding of God (as <HI>S. Augustine</HI> hath well obser|ued)
namely, <HI>Creatura, and Seriptura,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. lib. 2. de Trin. in proaem. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. 3 p. 260.</NOTE> the <HI>Creature,</HI> and the <HI>Scrip|ture;</HI>
the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Word:</HI> there haue so many men laboured in
this latter, that, for number, almost they be without number: but, in
the former part, so few, that they likewise, in comparison, be number|lesse
too. Some few, I confesse, haue written before me, of this matter:
but none at all in this manner: as I leaue it to be iudged by the wise and
learned. So that, I may truely take vp that excuse for all incident er|rors,
which Lucretius doth, euen in this very case, that,
<Q><L>Auia Pieridum peragro loca,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucret. l. 1. P. 34.</NOTE> nullius ante</L>
<L>Trita solo&mdash;</L>
<L>I walke a way lesse way, with vncouth pace,</L>
<L>Which yet no former Muse with foot did trace.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB REF="6">
The naturall <HI>Difficulty</HI> of the Argument, hath deterred the most
men from writing vpon it: and the paucitie of such writers, hath be|gotten
a second difficulty vnto me. Those whom I haue seene to haue
written vpon this Theme (for I goe not beyond the compasse of mine
owne Library) are onely these following. <HI>Aquinas contra Genti|les;
Raymundus de Sabunde, in Theologia naturali; Brad|wardinus
de Causa Dei;</HI> and <HI>Valesius de sacra Philosophia.</HI> But
these foure, dealing onely <HI>Scholastically,</HI> by way of Logicall Argu|ments,
which doe not <HI>influere,</HI> they cannot affect, nor leaue any great
impression in the mind of a man but (as the Orator aptly censureth
such short and sharpe conclusions) <HI>Haec spinosiora, prius vt confi|teamur
nos cogunt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. 1. Tuse. p. 110.</NOTE> <HI>quam vt assentiamur. Such thorny and
prickly conclusions of Logique, do rather inforce men to con|fesse
them, then induce men to beleeue them.</HI> There is further,
<HI>Augustinus Eugubinus;</HI> who in his Booke <HI>de perenni Philoso|phia,</HI>
hath laboured in this Theme, with singular learning, congesting
out of <HI>Poets, Philosophers,</HI> and <HI>Orators,</HI> an incredible masse of Au|thorities
and Sentences. But as the fore-named Authors delt onely by
argument, without any testimony; so dealeth he mostly by testimony,
without any argument. There is yet further, <HI>Ludouicus Viues, de
veritate Fidej Christianae;</HI> and <HI>Philippus Mornaeus,</HI> of the same
both argument and inscription&punc; <HI>Zanchius</HI> also, <HI>de Operibus Dej;</HI>
and the <HI>Second Part</HI> of the Booke of <HI>Resolution:</HI> all which haue
done learnedly, in their seuerall kindes. But yet, for those heads, wher|vpon
in this Book, I doe principally insist, they passe o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r them so
sleightly, and perstringe them so briefely, that all of them may be truly
affirmed, to haue beene, by those Authors, rather touched, then hand|led.
It hath beene mine endeauour, so to temper my writing, that nei|ther
Authorities should lacke their arguments; nor arguments their
Authorities; nor the Reader store of both. And yet in vsing the wri|tings
of those fore-named Authors, I haue entertayned this course: that
whatsoeuer any of them hath prolixely handled, that haue I either who|ly
pretermitted, or (at the most) but lightly touched. What they haue
pretermitted, that haue I sought out (so farre as I could) and more co|piously
inlarged. Whereby neither their writings shalbe preiudiced by
mine, nor mine thought a <HI>Plagium</HI> out of theirs: and yet the Reader
be inriched by the store of both of vs. And this hath also bred a <HI>third</HI>
difficulty vnto me. A <HI>fourth</HI> there groweth likewise from the destinate
<PB REF="6">
end, and scope of this worke: which is, to compell the Heathens to
preach the truth of Christians; and <HI>Philosophy</HI> to proue the grounds
of <HI>Diuinity:</HI> yea and to inforce, by strength of Argument, both <HI>Infi|dels,</HI>
and <HI>Epicures,</HI> and <HI>Atheists,</HI> who will not beleeue God in his
word; yet to beleeue him without his word. Which euery wise man will
easily imagine, to be a worke not easie to be done. For, as it is truely
obserued by <HI>Tertullian;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. lib. de Testim. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> c. 1. p. 84.</NOTE> <HI>Magna curiositate, &amp; maiore longe me|moria

greater memory, and yet of greatest study, to gleane out of the
writings of Philosophers, and Poets, and other secular Authors,
fit authorities, and testimonies, for the proofe of Christia~ truths.</HI></P>
<P>Now secondly, for the <HI>Variety</HI> of this Worke; that is such, and so
great, as none other could come neare it; if it were handled as it should.
For, this Worke intreateth both of God, and all his Workes; which
containe all those <HI>varieties,</HI> which God and Nature yeeldeth. In <HI>God</HI>
there commeth to be considered, all those diuine properties, which hee
hath adumbrated in any of his creatures; his <HI>Simplicity,</HI> his <HI>Immor|tality,</HI>
his <HI>Immensity,</HI> his <HI>Eternity,</HI> his <HI>Strength,</HI> his <HI>Wisedome,</HI>
his <HI>Goodnesse,</HI> his <HI>Dominion,</HI> his <HI>Omnipotency,</HI> his <HI>Omni|science,</HI>

in themselues, but yet such, as may in part be sufficiently
vnderstood, by that shadowy resemblance of them, which he hath gi|uen
vnto our soules. In his <HI>Creatures,</HI> there commeth to be discussed,
both the <HI>little World,</HI> with all the faculties of his body, and all the
powers of his mind; and the <HI>great World,</HI> with all his most excellent
and glorious parts; the <HI>Heauens,</HI> the <HI>Earth,</HI> the <HI>Seas,</HI> and all the se|uerall
creatures contained in all these&punc; yea and the admirable working
of Gods diuine prouidence, both in <HI>making,</HI> and <HI>preseruing,</HI> and in
<HI>ruling</HI> of al of them. Which (as euery simple man may easily see) be mat|thers
of the greatest <HI>Variety</HI> that can be. In all which points, I haue
giuen the Reader so much taste as may delight him, yet not to glut him.
For the full handling of them, would both be nauseous vnto him, te|dious
vnto me, and supersluous vnto both of vs; a meere deviation
from the scope of this worke; and in it selfe an attempt, not onely fond,
but also infinite.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
Now thirdly, for the <HI>Vtility</HI> and profit of this Treatise&punc; that may
partly be collected from the <HI>varieties</HI> of it. For it is the <HI>Orators</HI> ob|seruation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> 3. de. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. pag. 214</NOTE>
<HI>That those things which carry with them the grea|test
delight, doe commonly carry likewise the greatest profit&punc;

giueth for an instance, that great beautie and varietie which we see in
the world: which carrieth also with it, no lesse vtilitie and profit: the
very punctuall instance of this our present purpose.</P>
<P>But to consider the profit of this our Treatise, absolutely in it selfe,
without any such reference vnto his varieties. Can there possibly be a|ny
more profitable contemplation, either to excite and stirre vp a man
vnto godlinesse, or to incite him vnto thankfulnesse, then religiously
to weigh and pond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r with himselfe, the immensitie of Gods goodnesse,
who hath made both heauen and earth, and all the seuerall creatures
contayned in them both, to serue onely for his vse? This contemplati|on
wrought in the Prophet <HI>David</HI> so strongly, that it draue him almost
into an holy extasie; forcing him to breake out into that patheticall ex|clamation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psa. 8. 1.</NOTE>
<HI>O Lord our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in
all the world. Thou that hast set thy glory aboue the Heauens.
When I consider the Heavens, the worke of thy handes, the
Moone, and the Starres, which thou hast ordayned: What is
man (say I then) that thou art so mindfull of him, or the son
of man, that thou so visitest him?</HI> And marke heere againe, how
the Prophet resumeth his first admiration, by a Poeticall <HI>Epanalep|sis</HI>

<HI>the invisible things of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 20.</NOTE> <HI>by the creation of the world,</HI> if it du|ly
be considered and weighed as it ought, it will minister a more effectu|all
instruction vnto our eyes, then any that we commonly receiue in by
our eares. For,

<P><PB REF="7">
Fourthly, as concerning the <HI>Necessity</HI> of it: Looke what absolute
necessity the work of the foundation hath, vnto all the rest of the buil|ding;
the same (and no lesse) hath the proofe of these Propositions,
vnto all the other parts of Religion: For let but these foure positions
be substantially proued; <HI>That there is a God: That there is but one
God: That Iehovah our God, is that one God: And that the
Scripture is the Word of that God:</HI> and then all the other parts of
Religion, in the whole Scripture contained, are soundly supported and
vpheld. For then it will follow of it selfe, that <HI>whatsoeuer is in the
whole Scripture prescribed, it ought to be obeyed, as the very
word of God.</HI> But (on the other side) let either all, or any of these po|sitions
be disproued; <HI>That either there is no God;</HI> or, <HI>That there
is not onely one; or, That I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hovah is not that one;</HI> or, <HI>That
the Scripture is not his word:</HI> and then all Religion must needes
presently fall downe, as an house that lacketh his foundation. So that,
whether we consider the difficulty of this work in respect of the writer;
or the <HI>Variety, Vtility,</HI> and <HI>Necessity</HI> of it, in respect of the Reader:
it will (as I hope) be no labour ill spent, to bestow some time in the rea|ding
of it.</P>
<P>And yet I doubt not (courteous Reader) but this my labour and
indeauour will, of some men, be esteemed to be needelesse, and redun|dant:
that in this so cleere a light and sun-shine of the Gospell, I should
goe about to proue those grounded principles of Religion, which so
long haue beene receiued without all contradiction: the very seeking
to proue the vndoubted truth of them, carrying with it (in shew) a se|cret
doubting of them; at the least wise, a calling of their truth into
question, which hath hitherto beene questionlesse amongst all good and
sound Christians.</P>
<P>I represent the whole Obiection in his true and proper forme, as it
formerly hath beene represented vnto me by some, neither ill-learned,
nor ill-affected towards me. Whereby I may collect, that from those
which are more strange, or more estranged <HI>Readers,</HI> I may probably
expect that scomme of <HI>Theognetus:</HI>

<P>This measure (and no better) I but hardly shall escape, from those
rash and heady persons, who (like <HI>Sannioes</HI>) subsanne all things, but
onely their owne follies: not waighing the moment and nature of things.

<P>And yet, for the better remouing of the fore-alledged Exception,
and diuerse other of like nature, which might minister any scruple,
either vnto the curious or incurious Reader, I thought good to prae|munite
the succeeding Treatise, with this praeceding Preface&punc; to ex|empt
out of their minds, all those scrupulous exceptions, which (by
way of diuination) I could forecast would trouble them, touching ei|ther
the matter, or the manner of my writing. Vsing in the meane time
the same obtestation vnto my beneuolous Reader, which <HI>Lucretius</HI>
doth to his, in the very like matter:

<L>Lest that which I proiected for thy good,</L>

Yea, and the reason, which there is alledged by him, will also not vn|properly
<PB REF="8">
serue my turne:
<Q><L>Nam, tibi de summa Coeli ratione Deum&abque;</L>
<L>Disserere incipiam: &amp; rerum primordia pandam.</L>
<L>My purpose is, to treate of Heau'ns high Nature,</L>
<L>Of All's originall, and of All's Maker.</L></Q></P>
<P>First therefore, as concerning the fore-named Exception, <HI>That all
these foure Positions, which are the subiect of this Treatise, be
already amongst vs sufficiently beleeued; and that therefore it
is superfluous to call them now to be proued:</HI> Vnto this Obie|ction
I answer three things. First, that the principall scope and in|tent
of this Booke, is, rather to conuince those that beleeue them not,
then to confirme those that beleeue them. Though <HI>this</HI> also be intended
as a secondary end, as it likewise is, in <HI>the Creatures of God&punc;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 20.</NOTE> But
the <HI>prime end</HI> of this Worke, is, to confute all those, which either dis|pute
against Gods <HI>Essence and being,</HI> as the direct <HI>Atheist</HI> doth; or,
against his <HI>Prouidence and gouerning,</HI> as the <HI>Epicure</HI> doth, who
is an indirect <HI>Atheist:</HI> and to proue both of these to be men, not onely
destitute a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> all Piety and Religion, but also of common sense and rea|son.
And further, to shew vnto those acute <HI>Naturalists,</HI> who hold it a
seruility to be led with brutish-beleeuing, and will therefore entertaine
no more of Religion then they find to be consonant vnto Reason; that
<HI>here</HI> they may find reason for their <HI>Religion.</HI> All which seuerall kinds
and degrees of <HI>Atheists,</HI> it is not more incongruous for me to confute,
amongst beleeuing <HI>Christians,</HI> then it was for the <HI>Psalmist</HI> to confute
the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 14. 1. &amp;</NOTE> amongst beleeuing <HI>Iewes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 53. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>But secondly, I answer, that my conceite is too shallow to sound the
depth of that bottomlesse reason, <HI>That it should not bee lawfull to
prooue those Positions, because they bee already beleeued of
Christians.</HI> For if it were not lawfull to proue those points of <HI>Reli|gion,</HI>
which are now already accepted and beleeued; then (if we will
proue any thing) we must euery day bring forth a new <HI>Creed.</HI> For the
<HI>old</HI> may not be proued, because it is approued. And then were the
writings of the most <HI>Diuines,</HI> both <HI>ancient and recent,</HI> to be reie|cted.
For, what poynt of Diuinity doth any of them proue, in all their
writings, but that which was before admitted, and approued by all good
and sound Christians? Is it not lawfull to prooue the Articles of our
<HI>Creed,</HI> because they be already beleeued? or, is it lawfull to proue all
the rest; and is it not lawfull to proue the first? Is it lawfull to proue,
<PB REF="9">
that our Sauionr <HI>was conceiued by the holy Ghost? borne of the
Virgin Mary? suffered vnder Pontius Pilate? &amp;c.</HI> And is it not law|ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
to proue that <HI>There is a God? That he is our Father? That he
is Almighty?</HI> and, <HI>That he is the Maker of heauen and earth?</HI>
What strange infelicity is fallen vpon this one Article (which is the ve|ry
ground and support of all the rest) that to seeke to proue <HI>it</HI> should de|serue
reprehension, when to proue <HI>all the other</HI> deserueth commenda|tion?
I cannot reach (I say) the profoundnesse of this Reason.</P>
<P>But, thirdly, I answer: that it is a false position, That either all, or
any one of these foure fore-named positions, is so generally and con|stantly
beleeued, as that it hath no need, to be proued and confirmed.
For, there be but too too many men that haue their beleefe so vnperfect
in all of them, that it is mingled with much haesitation, doubting, and
wauering: so that, the best of them may say with him in the Gospell,
<HI>Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. 24. Plau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. in Mer|cat. Act. 5. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">c. 4. p. 547.</NOTE> <HI>I beleeue, helpe my vnbeleefe:</HI> And with him in the Come|dy,
<HI>Credo, sed tamen metuo miser.</HI> But yet specially, in the first
point, of beleeuing <HI>That there is a God,</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> of all the rest the most
vnbeleeued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ovid. l. 3. Amor|rum. Eleg. 8. p. 209.</NOTE> For, that which <HI>Ouid</HI> confesseth of himselfe, is also true

Amongst whom, it is but too true an obseruation which is made
by <HI>Iustin Martyr,</HI> an ancient learned Father, <HI>Dici quidem non|nullos
Christianos, esse vero nullius Numinis cultores. That
many men be called by the name of Christians, who yet be in|deed
no better then very Atheists:</HI> though not such as <HI>Diagoras</HI>
and <HI>Theodorus</HI> were, who made (as it were) a profession of their <HI>A|theisme;</HI>
yet such as are noted by the Prophet <HI>Dauid,</HI> which say in
their heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 14. 1.</NOTE> <HI>That there is no God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodoret. Serm 1. De Prouiden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ia. Tom. 2. p. 576</NOTE> Yea and sometimes go further too,
as is noted by <HI>Theodoret. Sunt quidam qui Christianorum qui|dem
nomine gloriantur, veritatis autem dogmata palam op|pugnant.
There be some that are called by the name of Christi|ans,
and yet do not onely deny Gods Truth in secret, but also
defie it, and oppugne it in publique,</HI> which commeth not much
<PB REF="9">
short of the direct and profest <HI>Atheist.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it is not <HI>the name</HI> of a <HI>Christian</HI> that can free a man
from <HI>Atheisme;</HI> nor <HI>reciting</HI> the <HI>Articles</HI> of our Christian beleefe
that can mak a true <HI>Beleeuer.</HI> To <HI>beleeue,</HI> is with the heart to assent:
it is not with the tongue to recite.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai 29. 13.</NOTE> For, <HI>many draw neere vnto God
with their lippes, whose hearts be farre from him.</HI> Therefore,
<HI>Corde crediture,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 10. 10.</NOTE> is a Christian mans <HI>Character,</HI> printed vpon his
heart, which many men doe lacke, who haue the marke of Christians
printed vpon their fore-heads: notwithstanding both the numberlesse
multitude of preaching, and the cleernesse of the Gospell, as bright as
any Sun shine. For, though it cannot be denied, that there neuer was
in any age, such subtilty of wit, such plenty of learning, and such study
of all things, both Diuine and Humane: Yet must it also be confessed
(if we will confesse the truth) that the greatest part of those excellent
gifts, wherewith God hath beautified and adorned this our age, are ra|ther
the gifts of <HI>Illumination,</HI> than of <HI>Sanctification;</HI> and such as
haue bred with many, rather a verball Religion in their mouthes, then
a reall in their hearts. We may euidently see this, in the practise of
common life: how all the Streets do sound, all Tables and Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">naries
resound, with learned discourses in euery kinde. The best Schooles of
<HI>Athens</HI> were neuer better able, to dispute <HI>de omni scibili,</HI> then many
men now doe almost at euery table. But yet this againe is very worthy
obseruation; that all this sharpenesse of wit, and abundance of learning,
is oftentimes abused, but onely to dispute, and make Obiections against
God. So that he taketh himselfe for the ioylliest fellow, that can shewe
himselfe best able to make some witty Obiection against the Bible: thus
abusing the great gifts of their wit and vnderstanding, euen against
God himselfe, who is the giuer of them.</P>
<P>Which prophanenesse so scandalized the Romane Orator <HI>Tully,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. de Nat. Deor. p. 237.</NOTE>

<HI>Prouidence;</HI> that surely in this poynt it was vtterly improuident, in
giuing so great Gifts and Ornaments vnto those men, whom it could
not but foresee would so not ably abuse them.</P>
<P>Now this is the worst kinde of <HI>Atheisme</HI> of all other, when as <HI>A|theisme</HI>
is grounded, not so much vpon <HI>Ignorance,</HI> as it is vpon the
opinion of <HI>Knowledge.</HI> And yet such is the <HI>Atheisme</HI> of this our time.
That which men at the first (like good Christians) receiued with the
simplicity of beleeuing; they now (being growne vnto greater know|ledge)
<PB REF="10">
desire to haue prooued, with the subtilty of disputing: else,
will they beleeue nothing. The greatnesse of mens wits sharpneth
many of them on, to see all things prooued by arguments, and de|monstrated
vnto sense. The Scriptures (with many) haue lost
their authority: and are thought onely fit for the ignorant, and
idiote: The World now swelling with an opinion of learning, though
it be indeede, in such men, but onely an opinion; yea, and that, a
very false one. For (as the Apostle S. <HI>Paul</HI> hath very truely cen|sured
them) <HI>Wherein they professe themselues to be wise,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 21. 22.</NOTE> <HI>therein
they doe shew themselues to be fooles:</HI> there being nothing more
foolish, then either not to beleeue that there is a God, who yet may
<HI>visibly be seene by the creation of the world;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 20.</NOTE> <HI>or, to beleeue
that the world was neuer created, because we see not visibly the
first creation of it</HI> This, though such vaine men doe conceite and
accompt to be their <HI>wisedome:</HI> yet is it indeed their palpable folly:
yea and that not onely in the Apostle <HI>Pauls</HI> iudgement, but also in
the iudgement of the very Heathen Poet, who calleth such mens
doubting, <HI>rationis egestatem, the very beggery of reason.</HI>
<Q><L>Tentat enim dubiam mentem rationis egestas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucret. lib. 5. pag. 227.</NOTE></L>
<L>Ecquaenam fuerit mundi genitalis origo.</L>
<L>It's want of reason, or it's reasons want</L>
<L>Which doubts the minde, and Iudgment so doth daunt,</L>
<L>That Worlds beginning, mak's men not to graunt.</L></Q>
Yea as thicke and grosse a folly, as if a man looking vpon some goodly
building, should professe, hee would not beleeue that it euer had beene
made; because he himselfe did not see the making of it. For, how dif|fer
they?</P>
<P>Therefore it is but an erroneous opinion, to thinke, that either a|mongst
Christians there can be no Atheists; or, that secret Atheists are
not to be convinced, as well as the publique: or, that the principles of
Religion are beleeued of all, by whom they bee confessed: or that they
ought not to be prooued vnto those men, of whom they bee already be|leeued.
All these (I say) be very great errors, but especially the
first. For beside the two fore-named sorts of Atheists, the one both
inword, and heart denying God; the other in word confessing him,
but in heart renouncing him; there is yet a third sort of them (yea and
those euen amongst Christians) who though both in word and in heart
they confesse him, yet doe they <HI>in their workes deny him.</HI> They be|leeue
<PB REF="10">
there is a God: but they liue, as if they beleeued there were none:
which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> perstringeth as a reall denying of him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Titus 1. 16.</NOTE> <HI>They
professe they know God, but by workes they deny him.</HI> Yea,
and his censure is approued, euen by the Heathen Poet: who sentenceth
all wicked, and licencious liuers, to bee no better, then a kinde of prag|maticall
Atheists.

<P>Now all these sorts of Atheists, are to bee convinced, and drawne,
<HI>obtorto collo, will they nill they,</HI> vnto God. Which, I hope, is per|formed
(I am sure indeauoured) in this Booke. Wherein, the first sort
of those Atheists, which deny <HI>there is a God;</HI> are forc't, by strength of
reason, to confesse that, they denied. The second sort of them, which
confesse there is a God, and yet beleeue it not; are taught to beleeue,
that which they haue confessed. The third sort of them, which both
beleeue, and confesse him, and yet haue no care to worship, or obey
him; are heere taught, to liue as they doe beleeue. So that, this
Booke hath great vse, towards all those sorts of Atheists, which be|leeue
not these positions. Yea, and no lesse (I hope) likewise, towards
those that beleeue them. For those true and sound Christians, which
both confesse the truth, and beleeue as they confesse, and liue as they be|leeue,
it notably confirmeth, both in their true faith, and in their good
life. So that it will no way be idle or super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">luous, neither towards the

<P>As for the capacitie of the simpler Readers; all is not written to them;
but the most vnto the learned, who are in most danger, with many
Obiections, vpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> these points to be troubled. But yet, there bee many
passages, throug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> out the whole Booke, which may easily be conceiued,
euen of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Readers: yea and that euen in the highest points,
which I haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> indeauoured to stoop and demitte, euen to the
capacitie of the very lowest, so farre as the nature of the things would
permit. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> may haply bee found true euen in this discourse
also (at the least in respect of the subiect matter handled, though not in
the forme &amp; manner of handling) which S. <HI>Gregorie</HI> affirmeth of the
holy Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Epist&punc; ad L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">andrum in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> that it is, <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">asi Fluuius, &amp; planus, &amp; altus; in quo,
&amp; Agnus ambuler, &amp; Elephas natet. That though there be some
subiects so deepe and profound, that the Elephant may swim in
them: yet be there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> againe, so obuious and shallow, that
<PB REF="11">
euen the Lambe may wade ouer them.</HI> And therefore the worke (as
I hope) will not be without his fruite, neither towards the Infidels, nor
yet towards Christians; neither towards the Learned, nor towards
the Vnlearned: which was the doubt of some men (themselues not vn|learned)
as concerning the Subiect and Argument of this Booke.</P>
<P>It therefore now remayneth, that, hauing giuen satisfaction vnto
such, as haue obiected against the matter of my writing, I should now
likewise indeauour to remoue those Exceptions, which some haply
<HI>may</HI> take against the Manner of it.</P>
<P>As first, it may be, that some Man, will except; that there is in this
Booke so much <HI>Philosophie,</HI> and so little <HI>Diuinitie.</HI> Whereunto I
breifely answer; that with those Aduersaries, against whom I am cheif|ly
to deale in this Booke, the <HI>Diuinity</HI> of Christians hath much lesse au|thoritie,
then the <HI>Philosophie</HI> of Heathens; naturall Reason a much
higher place, then supernaturall Religion; and the writings of <HI>Philo|sophers</HI>
much greater credit, then the holy Scriptures. So that (in re|spect
of the nature of those Aduersaries) there is more cause of exception
that here is so much Diuinity, then that there is so little. And yet euen <HI>for</HI>
this also, there is a iust Apologie: That this is done, <HI>ex abundante,</HI> ra|ther
to confirme those that beleeue, then to informe those that beleeue
not: that so the Booke may not be without his profit, whether it light in|to
the hands of Christians, or of Pagans.</P>
<P>Some againe (it may be) will except, <HI>That such a multitude of
Testimonies are congested to one purpose.</HI> But that hath many
vses, to the profit of the Readers. For first, The Matter questioned, is, by
multitude of Testimonies more substantially proued. Secondly, though
those Testimonies alledged, be by me often applyed, but to mine owne
present purpose: yet may the learned, Reader make manifold vse of
them, vnto diuers other purposes: and so in their varietie, haue choise
and election to take, or to leaue, as will best serue his turne. So that the
writers <HI>store,</HI> ought not to be accompted the Readers <HI>sore:</HI> if but in this
respect. But thirdly, though many be alledged to one and the same pur|pose:
yet may it be obserued, by the indicious Reader, that they doe not
all proceed by one and the same tenor: but that (for the most part) eue|ry
one bringeth some thing that the other had not: which may serue
the attentiue Reader, either for the better confirmation, or the clearer
illustration of the point, then in quaestion. Finally, if they will needs
haue this to bee the writers error; yet may I defend my selfe, with
<PB REF="12">
that same excuse, wherewith<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quintil. lib. 10. c. 1. p. 575.</NOTE> <HI>Quintilian</HI> defendeth <HI>Stesicorus:</HI> that,
<HI>Id si est reprehendendum, est tamen nisi Copiae vitium.</HI> Which
though it hath made the Booke some what bigger: yet hath it also (I
hope) made it better.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Athenaeus. lib. 3. p. 55.</NOTE> So that I am the lesse fearefull of <HI>Callimachus</HI>
his censure, that, <HI>Magnus Liber, est magno malo par. A great
Booke is little better then a great euill.</HI> Yea and so much the ra|ther,
because in those sentences I haue made choise of mine Authors, not
corrading out of all <HI>promiscue,</HI> and <HI>sine delectu,</HI> but taking only such
as are both ancient, and Classicall, as well <HI>Seculars,</HI> as <HI>Diuines.</HI> In
citing of whose Testimonies, I haue not alledged them all pariter, as they
stand in their Author: but (leauing out all exorbitant and heterogene|all
Clauses, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">itted not my purpose) I haue taken onely so much as
was properly incident vnto mine owne ends, and hindered not the con|text,
and roundnesse of the speech: yet alwayes, with this care, neither
to wrest, nor wrong the sense of the Author.</P>
<P>Some againe may except, against the citing of mine Authors so par|ticularly;
Booke, Chapter, and Page; as carrying with it, some touch (or
at least, some shew) of Vanitie. But, vnto that I answer that it was not
to ostentate, and make shew of mine owne reading (which it greatly re|penteth
me to be so little) but to helpe my Reader with it, such as it is:
not envying his profit, but seeking, with all my best endeauour, to pro|mote
it. And indeed, I haue alwayes esteemed it a great ouersight, yea
and a kinde of vnkindenesse, in any writer, in the citing of his Authors,
to send his Reader to seeke in an indefinite compasse, when as he him|selfe
can direct him vnto the definite place: by that meanes also, de|feating,
the very end and purpose of his owne paines in writing&punc; which
is, onely to increase his Reader in all knowledg and vnderstanding. Be|sides,
Whereas in the citing of those Authors, I doe oftentimes allude
but in a word or two, vnto many great Matters, which in the Authors
themselues are set downe more prolixly: this directing of my Reader
vnto the plac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> so particularly, will oftentimes serue him in stead of a
Commentarie, storing him to euery purpose, with a great deale of more
matter, then I haue extracted out of the Author.</P>
<P>And yet, no man is hereby tyed vnto the same edition of the Authors
that by my selfe is vsed. I doe but only direct them, which haue the same
editions, how to make more ready vse of them. As for those that haue
them not, I haue noted, not onely the Author, but the Booke also, and
the Chapter: and so come as neere them, as I could possibly imagine.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">
Another Exception may perhaps be also taken: <HI>That Verses bee
sometimes cited, and yet not as verses.</HI> But this may be defended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fraz, Poet. pag. 141. Versorum pro versuum.</NOTE>
with that excuse of <HI>Laberius,</HI> that, <HI>Versorum non numerorum
numero studuimus. I therein followed rather the power of the
sense, then the number of the syllables.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. Epist. 101. p. 251.</NOTE> And, with another like, of
<HI>Seneca's,</HI> that <HI>Animis ista scripsi, non auribus.</HI></P>
<P>Some againe may except that Greeke writers are not cited in their
owne proper language. Whereunto I answer: First, that the weight of
those Testimonies, which I haue taken out of them, doth seldome, or ne|uer,
rest vpon the proprietie of the Greeke word or phrase: but mostly
vpon the matter, and the sense. Secondly, that if it did: yet the credit
of the Translator hath no lesse authoritie, then any Nomenclator, or
Dictionarie maker, but rather much greater: Because, hee is led vnto
his translation; by exactly perpending the true weight of euery word as
it is in that place vsed, rendring it most properly out of the congruitie
of those circumstances that he hath before considered, both in the an|teceding
and succeeding passages: which are the best directions, and
cannot be considered by the bare reciter of the words in their seuerall
significations. But thirdly, and lastly (which stoppeth all reply) I haue
cited those Authors, as I had them: contenting my selfe with the vse
of those Booke, which were onely mine owne, and in mine owne posses|sion,
not affecting to be curious, either in this, or in any thing else which
tendeth not directly vnto the profit of my Readers.</P>
<P>Againe it may be obiected; that the Sentences alleadged are not ex|actly
translated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aul. G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l. lib. 9. c. 9 p. 124.</NOTE> Whereunto againe I answer: that to the sense they
be alwayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horat. lib. de Art. Poet. p. 169.</NOTE> though, to the words, not alwayes: For, that needs not: in
the opinion of an excellent Criticke And the Poet telleth vs, that hee
may be a faithfull Translator that doth it not.
<Q><L>Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere fidus</L>

But, the Orator telleth vs, that hee cannot be a delightfull Translator
that doth it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cie. lib 3. De Fin p. 68.</NOTE> <HI>Verbume verbo exprimere, interpretis est indiserti.</HI></P>
<P>Againe, yet an other, <HI>That I haue not alwayes cited them to the
meaning of the Author.</HI> To which I likewise answer: That, when|soeuer
I produce them, as Testimonies for the confirmation of the point
then in question, I cite them exactly, vnto the Authors meaning. But
<PB REF="13">
that is not alwayes my end in alledging them: but, sometimes, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
their words, by way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, rather then of allegation, for the more
commodious expressing of mine owne sense and meaning. A thing very
vsuall and familiar with <HI>Plutarch;</HI> whose character, and forme of stile
I haue (in that point) propounded to imitate.</P>
<P>Finally, it may be, that some men will except against the publishing
of this first part alone, before the rest be ready: in putting vnto me, the
incurious error of <HI>Curio</HI> the Orator.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. in. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">43.</NOTE> <HI>Qui, aliquoties tria cum pro|posuisset,
aut quarum adderet, aut tertium quaereret. Who often
times, propounding to speake but of three things, commonly,
either added to them a fourth, or else forgat to speak of the third.</HI>
But, for this course of proceeding, I am not without my reason: as name|ly.
First the example of very many learned men; whom wee dayly
obserue to practice the same, and to propine vnto their Readers
an assay of their works, to take a tast of them, how themselues are
tasted by them. Secondly, because this first part of the worke hath
growne exceeding great, and beyond mine expectation, beeing
now come vnto the measure and bignes of a Volume. And thirdly, it
had no little moment with me, that diuers of my learnedest and best
affected Friends, haue often importuned mee vnto the publi|shing
of it, hastening (in their loue) this vnperfect worke, vnto the
edition; peraduenture, as an vntimely fruit vnto his abortion: but
without peraduenture,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. Orat&punc; ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> p. 35.</NOTE> vnto that common condition, which is obserued
by <HI>Isocrates</HI> to be fatal, to many Booke. <HI>Vt dum adhuc in mentibus

and intent of my writing, being onely the good, and profit of my Rea|ders;
I should greatly wrong, both their curtesie and equitie, to make
any doubt of their fauourable acceptance. Which, if they should not af|forde,
they themselues should wrong them both. For what can be more
contrarie, both to curtesie, and equitie, then either to speake, or but to

<ARGUMENT>
<P>1. To beleeue there is a God, is the ground of all Religion. 2. The end
and purpose of this Booke, is to proue that Position. 3. This cannot be beleeued,
but by the helpe of Prayer. 4. It cannot be proued, a Priorj. 5. Yet may it
be shewed, a Posteriori.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe very first foundation of all pietie and Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To beleeue there is a God the foundati|on of all Re|ligion.</NOTE> is <HI>To
beleeue there is a God:</HI> as it is generally beleeued, and
confessed by all men, both by Christians, Iewes, and
Heathen, if they hold any religion. The Apostle in the
Epistle to the <HI>Hebrewes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 6.</NOTE> layeth this, as the first ground
of all religion and Godlines, to beleeue, <HI>That God is.</HI>
For, as <HI>Lactantius</HI> very truly noteth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lactant&punc; lib. De vero cultu. c. 9. p 333 336</NOTE> <HI>Caput est primum
Diuinae Legis, ipsum Deum nosse:</HI> It is the very first head of the law of God,
to know and beleeue, that there is a God. And againe, a little after. <HI>Hic est
Sapientiae primus gradus, vt sciamus, quis sit nobis verus Pater:</HI> This is the
prime degree of wisedome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palingen. in Sagit. p. 268.</NOTE> to know who is our true God and Father. Yea
and <HI>Palingenius,</HI> vnto the same purpose.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Prima est virtus, prim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> est sapientia, Regem</L>
<L>Coelicol&ucirc;m Patrem&abque; hominum cognoscere&mdash;</L>
<L>It's Mans prime vertue, Wisdom's chiefest thing,</L>
<L>To know his Father to be Heauen's high King.</L></Q>
<P>Nay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theoph. Alex.</NOTE> <HI>Pietas in Deum est</HI> super omnia, <HI>quasi</HI> culmen <HI>&amp; corona virtutum;</HI> saith
<HI>Theophilus Alexandrinus:</HI> Nay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Virtutum omnium principium,</HI> saith <HI>Philo Iu|daeus.</HI>
True pietie towards God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paschal. Bib&punc; Pat.</NOTE> is not onely the highest, but also the first
of all other vertues. Neither doe Christians onely reckon this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom. 1. p. 391.</NOTE> for the first
stone in the building of Religion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. Iud. lib.</NOTE> but the Iewes doe also confirme the very
same.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De decalogo p. 1018.</NOTE> <HI>Aben Ezra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aben Ezra apud Iosippu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> p. 297.</NOTE> in his Exposition of the ten Commandements, saith of the
first of them, that, <HI>Hoc primum dictum, est fundamentum omnium nouem ver|borum,
quae sequuntur post ipsum.</HI> The first of the Commandements, (which
prescribeth vnto vs the hauing of a God) is the very true foundation of all
the other nine. Yea and the same is also confessed euen by the very Heathen.
<PB N="2" REF="20">
<HI>Seneca</HI> affirmeth (and that very truly) that it is <HI>primus Deorum cultus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. Epist. 96. p. 237.</NOTE> <HI>Deos

Yea and it is <HI>primus cultus</HI> too, not onely <HI>Ordine,</HI> but also <HI>Honore:</HI> It
is the first in <HI>Honour,</HI> as well as in <HI>Order.</HI> For, <HI>Maiorem virtutem religione,
pietate&abque; in Deum</HI> (saith <HI>Plato) nullam in humano genere inveniri, quisquam
sibi per suadeat.</HI> Let no man be perswaded, that there is any greater good in
the Societie of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Epi|nom. p. 918.</NOTE> then is true pietie, and religion towards God. And
therefore, it was <HI>Chrysippus</HI> his opinion that, <HI>Cognitio de Deo, principium est
cognitionis &amp; bonoru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; malorum.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. lib. De Stoic. R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> pub.

Pythag. p. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> that
there is a God, is the beginning of all other knowledges, both of good and
euill things. Whence both <HI>Phocylides</HI> and <HI>Pythagoras</HI> beginne their
Poems, with, <HI>Prim&ugrave;m, cole Deum</HI>&mdash;Remember first, Feare God thou must.
So that, by the confession of all sorts of men, this is the very ground of all
Religion, <HI>To beleeue there is a God.</HI></P>
<P>And there can be no Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where God is not beleeued all wickednes is planted.</NOTE> where this is not beleeued. For how can there
be any godlines, where there is no God? If there be no beliefe, no opinion of
God, there cannot be possibly any affection of godlinesse: no nor any effect of
goodnes neither. For as co~cerning godlines, it is the obseruation of <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
that the ignorance of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. lib. De Su|persti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. Tom&punc; 1. Mor. p. 380.</NOTE> is the root of all vngodlines. <HI>Deoru~ ignoratio in du|ris

of <HI>Silius Italicus,</HI> that the ignorance of God is the root of all wickednes.

<L>Alas, the cause of sinne, is onely this,</L>
<L>That Sinners know not, what Gods Nature is.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sil. Italic. lib. 4. p. 56. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></L></Q>
Which <HI>Abraham</HI> also, in a manner, confessed, when he thought thus in him|selfe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 20. 11.</NOTE>
<HI>Surely the feare of God is not in this place, and therefore will they kill me
for my wife.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. Epist. 96. p. 23<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> For where the feare of God is not, there euen, <HI>Homo, sacrares, eti|am
per ludum &amp; iocum occiditur.</HI> There euen the killing of a man, is but a sport
vnto them. So that where there groweth not true religion and godlines, there
must grow of necessitie all kind of sinne and wickednesse.</P>
<P>2. And therefore the maine scope and purpose of this worke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To beleeue there is a God is the summe of all Religion.</NOTE> is, to proue
There is a God: and so to lay in mens hearts a foundation of Religion.
Which being once well and substantially done, all the other three positions
will follow in their order, euery one with great ease in the necke of another.
For as <HI>Socrates</HI> collecteth in morall Philosophy, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. lib. 1. De Orat. p. 147.</NOTE> <HI>Quibus id semel persua|sum
est, nihil vt se malint, quam viros bonos esse, ijs reliquam facilem esse doctri|nam;</HI>
That he that once hath entertayned but this one resolution, that (come
of it what will) he will be a good man, the learning of all other things will
be very easie vnto him: so is it true likewise, in the doctrine of Diuinity; that he
who once hath entertained but the first of these positio~s, in faithfully beleeuing
that there is a God; vnto him all the rest will be easie to be proued. For, if he
once admit, that <HI>There is a God,</HI> he must admit him to be God vnder those di|uine
properties, which are naturall, &amp; essentiall vnto God: that is, he must yeeld
him to be, both <HI>Optimus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iupiter &agrave; maio|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ibus nostris Optimus Maxi|mus appellatur. Cic. lib. 2. de Nat. Deor. p. 210</NOTE> and <HI>Maximus:</HI> which, by the common notion, are his
proper attributes. From whence it follows, <HI>That there can be but one God:</HI> which
is our second position: because <HI>Superlatiues</HI> are <HI>Singulars;</HI> &amp; by their singulari|tie,
not communicable vnto many. Now, this being admitted, that <HI>There is but
<PB N="3" REF="20">
one God:</HI> then compare <HI>Iehovah</HI> our God, with all the other Gods of the
Heathen, and it vvill easily appeare, that he must needs be that one. <HI>For the
Workes which he doth, they doe testifie it of him.</HI> Novv,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 5. 36.</NOTE> this once being yeelded
that our God <HI>Iehouah</HI> is the onely true God, it vvill easily be proued, that
<HI>The Scriptures are his word,</HI> by the diuinenesse of that doctrine, vvhich is con|tayned
in them. And, that once being yeelded, it vvill follovv of congruitie
that vve must performe those duties, vvhich in the same vvord are prescribed:
vnlesse vve vvill despise, both the <HI>will,</HI> and <HI>word</HI> of God. All these points
hang together, euery one vpon another, by an indissoluble Chaine. So that
the vvhole consequence of all Religion, dependeth altogether vpon the pro|uing,
and approuing of this first proposition, <HI>That there is a God.</HI></P>
<P>3. But this point can neuer vnto any good effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prayer must helpe vs vnto vnderstanding. Plato in Epin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m p. 918.</NOTE> be either proued by me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodoret. Serm 9. de Prouid. To&punc; 2. p. 615.</NOTE>
or approued by you, vvithout Gods speciall grace, and blessing vpon vs both.
For it is very true, vvhich <HI>Plato</HI> affirmeth, <HI>Hoc nemo docebit, nisi Deus adiuuerit</HI>
No man can euer teach it, if God himselfe doe not assist it. And therefore <HI>The|odoret</HI>
in his Sermons <HI>De Providentia,</HI> beginneth his ninth Sermon, vvith
an holy inuocation, <HI>Prouidentia illa, quam impij oppugnant, in auxilium voca|ta;</HI>
calling to his assistance, in his fighting against <HI>Atheists,</HI> the same diuine
prouidence, vvhich they so fight against. And so likevvise doth <HI>Epiphanius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Epiph. lib. 1. cont. Haeres. p. 1.</NOTE> in
the beginning of his vvorkes: <HI>Valde time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, vt qui moliar opus non vulgare, et in|voco
ipsum sanctum Deum, &amp;c.</HI> I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ndertake no vulgar vvorke; and therefore
inuocate the holy God, to send his heauenly light into my minde &amp;c. And
<HI>Nazianzen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazian. Orat. 21 Apol. f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g. p. 398.</NOTE> in one of his Orations, prescrib's it for a rule, that, <HI>Quis quis vel
orationem aliquam, vel negotium auspicatur, non alium meliore~, commodior em&abque;
ordinem, tenere potest, quam vt a Deo incipiat, et, in Deo conquiescat.</HI> Whoso|euer
doth beginne any solemne Oration, or any other kind of negotiation, he
cannot possibly obserue any better order, then both to take his beginning
from God, and to make his ending in God. And herein, it is a matter of ve|ry
vvorthy obseruation, to note (in this point) the pietie, euen of the very
Heathen: of their <HI>Poets, Orators,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The very Hea|thens v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Prayer in the beginning of their works. Cap. 5. Sect&punc; 1.

the beginning of their vvorks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virg. Eclog. 3. p. 8.</NOTE> vvith prayers and invocations vnto
their Gods. Let me giue you an instance or tvvo, to this purpose. For <HI>Poets</HI>
vve see it euidently both in <HI>Aratus,</HI> among the <HI>Greekes;</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> among the
<HI>Latin's;</HI> that both of them beginne their Poems, vvith
<Q>Ab Ioue principium</Q>&mdash;With Ioue the Muses must begin,
in plaine and expresse termes. And there is nothing more familiar amongst
all the rest, then still, with the proposition of their worke, to ioyne some in|vocation
vnto their Gods, or Muses. For Orators, <HI>Pericles</HI> (amongst the
<HI>Greek's</HI>) in all his Orations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AElian. lib. 4. de var&punc; Hist. c. 10. p. 423.</NOTE> was wont still to make a prayer for good and
prosperous successe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demost&punc; To. 2. p. 3.</NOTE> And the same we may see likewise in the Orator <HI>De|mosthenes,</HI>
how in that weighty cause, his Oration <HI>De Corona,</HI> he beganne it
with a prayer for a fauourable audience. <HI>Deos De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s&abque; omnes precor, &amp;c.</HI> And
<HI>Plinie Iunior,</HI> amongst the Latin's, in his <HI>Panegyrical</HI> Oration vnto the Em|peror
<HI>Traian,</HI> reporteth; that it was not onely an ordinary custome, but also
a religious institution of the <HI>Romanes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. in. Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">egir&punc; p. 360.</NOTE> That they should beginne with prayer,
not onely, in all their ciuil affaires, but also in all their solemne Orations.
Yea and <HI>Protagoras</HI> (though by some esteemed an <HI>Atheist</HI>) yet he maketh <HI>Pre|cationem,
<PB N="4" REF="21">
cationem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert. in vitae Protagorae. p. 321.</NOTE> to be one of the essentiall parts of an Oration. Yea, and so did also
diuers other Orators beside him, as <HI>Laertius</HI> reporteth: but he maketh prayer
to be the first of them in order. And for Philosophers, <HI>Plato</HI> reporteth the
same of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> which <HI>Plinie</HI> before did of the <HI>Romans,</HI> that they or|dain'd
a law, to inioyne their Philosophers, to beginne all their disputations
with prayers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o p. 704. 713.</NOTE> <HI>Tua interest, &ocirc; Timae, invocatis (secund&ugrave;m legem) Dijs, dispu|tationem

is appointed in our Lawes) <HI>To giue a beginning to our intended disputation.</HI>
And againe, in the same Booke. <HI>Deum nunc disputationis servatorem in pri|mis

this our disputation: and therefore, first of all, let vs call vpon him. Yea and
<HI>Tullie</HI> (among the Latin's) in his second Booke <HI>De Legibus,</HI> beginneth there
his Treatise with invocation vpon the Gods.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. lib. 2. De Leg. p. 320.</NOTE> <HI>A Dijs immortalibus sunt nobis
agenda primordia: citing</HI> for his defense, the fore-cited religious example of
<HI>Aratus.</HI> And this his pious imitation, is, in the same place, very greatly
approued, by his Brother <HI>Quintus.</HI> Yea and <HI>Xenophon</HI> generally prescribeth
<HI>Omnem a Dijs actionem auspicari oportere:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xenoph. in Oe. conom. p. 239.</NOTE> That euery humane act ought al|wayes
to make his beginning with God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">obaeus lib. 1. Eclog. phys. cap. 3. p. 3.</NOTE> Yea and <HI>Theodectus</HI> likewise; vnto
the same purpose <HI>A Dijs initium sumere omne conuenit.</HI> It is alwayes fitting,
to take from God our beginning. Which Pietie of the Heathens, will, out of
doubt, condemne the impietie of vs Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">stians, if in our like businesses, we
vse not the like Godlines.</P>
<P>Now, if we ought to sanctifie our ingresse, with our prayers, in all our o|ther
attempts of importance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prayer must helpe vs to be|leeue, <HI>That God is.</HI></NOTE> then ought we, most of all, to call vpon God,
when we come to dispute of the nature of God: which is an attempt of the
greatest importance. And therefore <HI>Plato</HI> beginneth that his weighty dispu|tation,
wherein he sought to proue that there is a God, by inuocating the
helpe and assistance of God. <HI>Ag&egrave; igitur, nunc, magis qu&agrave;m vnqu&agrave;m, Deum
omni studio invocemus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. lib. 10. De leg&punc; p. 873.</NOTE> <HI>c&ugrave;m Deos esse diligenter demonstrare conemur.</HI> Let
vs now, most of all, implore the helpe of God, when we goe about to show

doe not teach it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phi. Iud. lib. De Monarchia. p. 1102.</NOTE> For, as light (saith <HI>Philo Iudaeus</HI>) cannot be showen by

of Demonstration, which sheweth <HI>Propter quid sit,</HI> the <HI>Principles</HI> cannot be

<P>Now these posterior Arguments, though they be not so strongly conclu|dent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. lib. 2. Me|taphys. c. 3. To. 2. p. 1388.</NOTE>
as the former; yet are they sufficient to carry the matter. For, as <HI>Aristotle</HI>

<P>_IT is good in all causes, for euery man, to vnderstand, not only
his aduantages, but also his disuantages: lest expecting greater
matters then the cause will affoord, he be needlesly offended,
when his expectation is destituted. The Cause here in quaestion
betweene <HI>Atheists,</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> hath two great disuantages.
The first of them is this; that by the clearenes of the Position now called into
quaestion, <HI>Whether there be a God;</HI> we are cut off, from the strongest kinde of
our Arguments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The best Te|stimonies, to proue, that <HI>There is a God,</HI> are the Testi|monies of the Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ptures.</NOTE> which containe the causes of their owne Conclusions: as I
haue already shewed in the former Chapter. The second, that (by the infi|delitie
of the Aduersarie) we are likewise cut off, from our weightiest Testimo|nies:
as I purpose to shew in this. The weightiest Testimonie that can be
brought, in this cause, to proue, <HI>There is a God,</HI> is to produce (for the proofe
<PB N="9" REF="23">
of it) the Testimonie of God, speaking in his owne word. This is proper, this
is naturall, this is truly inhaering in the very marrow of the cause. None other
in the world can haue aequal authoritie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io: 8. 13. 14.</NOTE> And though the <HI>Pharises</HI> obiected
against our Sauiour Christ, that <HI>his Testimonie was not trne; because he testi|fied
of himselfe:</HI> yet he answered them truly againe vnto that, that it was no
good consequent: but that, <HI>though he testified of himselfe, yet his testimonie
was true.</HI> For what can possibly be true, if the Testimonie of <HI>Truth</HI> be not?
<HI>Christ is the truth it selfe:</HI> and so likewise is God: yea and so likewise is his

that <HI>The Scripture is Gods word;</HI> they doe contradict themselues, if they say
<HI>There is a God.</HI> And therefore, they doe cast God, and his holy word, both

offended the learned father <HI>Saluianus,</HI> that he will not vouchsafe to dispute

If I haue to doe with Christians, I shall quickly proue the cause: But if
with infidels and Pagans, I scorne to lose my paynes. Not that I am in doubt to
be defectiue in my proofe, but that I am out of doubt not to speake vnto their
profit. For it needs must be an idle and vnprofitable labour, when the proofe is
not receiued by the euill disposed Auditor.</HI> This was the resolution of that
learned Father. But it is not mine. I purpose not, in this cause, to be so perem|ptory
with them: but to win them as I can, both by disputing, &amp; perswading.
And therefore, the best way of preuailing with them, will be, onely to vrge
such Arguments vnto them, as haue passage amongst them; and such Au|thorities,
as haue some credit with them. Now, that hath not the <HI>Scripture,</HI>
as you heard before. And therefore, in this case, we must not proue by <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI>
that <HI>That is a God:</HI> For that would be but a foolish kinde of proofe. It
would be meerely idle, to call vpon our Aduersaries to heare an Argument,

<HI>authoritie:</HI> This would make the cause ridiculous. But if we wil preuaile either
with them, or against them, we must bring only such authorities, as with them
haue credit and reputation, that is, not the testimonie of the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Testimo|nies of the Heathens, are more regar|ded with <HI>Atheists,</HI> then the Scriptures Sect. 4. and 5. <HI>Lactan. lib. De Iustitia. cap. 4. p.</HI> 268.</NOTE>
but rather the testimonie of prophane and <HI>Heathen Writers;</HI> whom, they who|ly
accepting in all other matters, cannot wholy reiect in this. And therefore
<HI>Lactantius</HI> reproueth <HI>S. Cyprian,</HI> as being greatly ouerseene, that in his dispu|tation
with <HI>Demetrian,</HI> an Heathen, he would seeke to confute him by the
Authority of <HI>Scriptures:</HI> whom he should haue confuted by <HI>Philosophers,</HI>

handled not his matter, as he ought to haue done. For he should not haue confu|ted
him by the testimonie of Scriptures (which he held for vaine, and idle, and
meerely commentitious:) but rather by the strength of Arguments, and Reasons.</HI>
And againe a little after. <HI>Huic oportebat quia nond&ugrave;m potu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t capere diuinae,

So that, neither the testimonie of God, nor of his word; though they haue

so much vpon hope to doe any great good vpon the <HI>Atheist</HI> with them, by
pressing directly their <HI>Authoritie</HI> vnto him, as indirectly to grow somewhat
vpon him, by an Artificiall circumduction of him: and that by these two
reasons following.</P>
<P>First, because of my often allegation of the <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> consenting so
fully with other Heathen writers, the <HI>Atheist</HI> may the better be able to dis|cerne;
that there is an vniuersall agreement, and a generall consent of the
whole world, against him; both of <HI>Christians, Iewes,</HI> and <HI>Pagans:</HI> and there|by
see more plainely, his owne nakednes and pouertie; how bare, and weake,
yea how desolate he is, and vtterly forsaken, both of God, and men: and
by that meditation, be more easily drawne, to apprehend the singular follie
of that his singular opinion: which hath made him such a <HI>spectacle,</HI> both
to <HI>Angels, God, and Men:</HI> as it were some vncouth monster. And so in|deed
he is.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g. lib. 22. De Ciu. Dei. c. 8. To. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 13 39.</NOTE> For, <HI>Magnum est ipse prodigium, qui, mundo credente, non credit</HI>
(saith S. <HI>Augustine) He is</HI> (surely) <HI>some great Monster, that will abide in
Atheisme, when he seeth the whole world to beleeue, beside him.</HI> So that, in
this respect, the allegation of the Scriptures, will not be meerely idle, to|wards
the very <HI>Atheists.</HI></P>
<P>No, nor yet in an other: which is the second reason of my so frequent
alledging them. And that is, because the <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> (beside that di|uine
authoritie, which is naturally inhaerent in them) doe oft-times, carry
also great strength of reason with them: which inforce many points more
strongly and effectually, against the <HI>Atheists,</HI> then the acutest reasons,
brought by any of the Philosophers. As that of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> for the
proofe of Gods omniscience:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 94. 9.</NOTE> and that he needs must (of congruitie) both
heare, and see all things. <HI>He that planted the Eare, shall he not heare? and he
that formed the Eye, shall he not see?</HI> What Philosopher in the world could
more necessarily conclude, from the true and proper causes of the conclu|sion,
then the <HI>Scripture</HI> here hath done? And diuers such places of the
<HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> the Reader shall meete with, throughout this whole Trea|tise;
which presse, yea, and euen oppresse, the <HI>Atheists</HI> with the weight
of their Reason: howsoeuer the weight of their Authoritie be eleuated by
them. For though those sacred Authors haue but small authoritie with
<HI>Atheists,</HI> speaking as meere Witnesses: yet, when their Testimonies carry
with them also reasons, those reasons must be answered, if they will de|fend
their cause. And if they cannot answer them, they must then yeeld
vnto them: which is the second reason of my so often citing them.</P>
<P>Now vnto these two reasons, in respect of the <HI>Atheists,</HI> I may also adde a
<PB N="13" REF="25">
third, in respect of <HI>Christians.</HI> And that is, that by this allegation of <HI>Scrip|tures,</HI>
&amp; other the most learned Ecclesiasticall Writers, euen <HI>Christians</HI> them|selues
will be the better confirmed, in those points of <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> which
are by them affirmed. For when they see these doctrines&punc; which are chiefly
here prooued by naturall reasons, and by Heathen mens authorities; yet not
to rest wholly and onely vpon them; but to be such, as haue both <HI>Scriptures,</HI>
&amp; <HI>Fathers</HI> to approue them; it must needes much confirme them in their re|ceiued
Faith: yea, and that a great deale more, for the simple authority of the
<HI>Scriptures</HI> themselues, then for the strongest reasons of all the learnedest Phi|losophers.
For this Authority alone, without any reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Illorum autho|ritas est omni rationabili fa|cultate validi|or. Nazian. O|rat. 47. p. 770.</NOTE> ouer-swayeth both all
their reasons &amp; authorities together;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. l. 3. De Prouid. Rib. Pat.

That needeth no other arguments to proue it, which is proued sufficiently,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ecause God hath said it.</HI></P>
<P>4 And yet the Authority of Gods word, as great as it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The most pro|per authorities in respect of the Aduersa|ries.</NOTE> is the little enough
with <HI>Atheists:</HI> in whose foolish opinion, the testimony of the <HI>holy Apostles,</HI>
or <HI>Prophets,</HI> haue a great deale lesse credit, then the testimony of the Hea|then
<HI>Philosophers,</HI> and Poets. And therefore, in our disputation against them,
we must omit the former, and onely vse these latter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sect. 2.</NOTE> if we will doe good vp|pon
them: as <HI>Claudius Victor</HI> very wisely aduiseth; ascribing, by one instance
a Rule of proceeding, in euery like case.</P>

not by the Argument of <HI>Christians,</HI> but by the testimony of <HI>Pagans.</HI> Yea, and
euen the holy Ghost himselfe, hath taken also the same course, disputing a|gainst
the Heathens, by the Testimony and Authority of their owne Hea|then
Writers; in three seuerall places: Yea, and in the last of them, hee ho|noureth
a Poet, with the name of a Prophet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 28. 1. Cor. 15. 33. Tit. 1. 12.</NOTE> Not that <HI>he</HI> thought him so;
but because <HI>they</HI> esteemed him so: inforcing so, his testimony, the more
strongly against them, from that credit and authority, which themselues as|cribe
vnto him.</P>
<P>5 Then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Testimo|nies of the Heathens, why here so much vsed.</NOTE> the reasons, why in this our disputation against <HI>Atheists,</HI> wee
must vse the testimony of Heathen-Writers, and not of holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> bee
both many and weighty.</P>
<P>First, because in euery disputation, both the disputants must consent, in
two generall agreements: else they can neuer bring the matter, then in que|stion,
vnto determination. The first of them, is this: That they must both a|gree
in certaine grounds and principles, which are common vnto both. For,
<PB N="14" REF="26">
as two cannot talke together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qui sermonem invicem com|municaturi sunt, oportet vt ali|quatenus invi|cem intellig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nt. Arist. l. 11. Me|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s. c. 4. To. 2. p. 1486.</NOTE> vnlesse they haue some one common language,
which they both vnderstand: so cannot two dispute together, except they
haue some one common principle, in which they both consent. Now those
principles and grounds, must not be principles of Religion; but of Reason.
Not of Religion; because that is proper, but vnto the one part: but yet of
Reason; because that is common vnto them both. The second generall a|greement,
wherein they must consent, is, Who shall be their <HI>Iudge,</HI> and vnto
whom they will submit, and vnto whose decision they will referre all their
Question, as to a man impartiall, and indifferent betweene them? Now that
cannot be the <HI>Scripture:</HI> but it must be Heathen Writers. To the <HI>Scriptures,</HI>
the <HI>Atheist</HI> will neuer submit; because then his cause is lost: but to the <HI>Hea|thens,</HI>
the <HI>Christian</HI> may submit; and yet his cause be gained. For, the truth
that is spoken by the most heathenish of the Heathens, yet can neuer bee re|pugnant
to the truth of the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> Two lies and vntruthes, may con|trary
one another; but two truthes can neuer. So then, the <HI>Heathens</HI> being
made <HI>Iudges</HI> of this cause, and admitted, as indifferent, by consent of both
parties; there can no other testimonies be so apt, and so proper, to inforce a
conclusion, as those that be produced from the writings of the Heathen.</P>
<P>Secondly, because the writings of the Heathens (beside the great credit,
and authority which they haue with our Aduersaries) haue also greater store
of artificiall Arguments, to satisfie both naturall reason, and sense: Whereas
<HI>Scripture,</HI> for the most part, presseth rather the <HI>Conscience,</HI> by virtue of that
diuine authority, which it hath naturally in it, then leadeth our <HI>science,</HI> by ar|gument
out of it. Sometimes it also argueth, and that very excellently, as
before I haue instanced: but this very rarely, relying most commonly vpon
his owne natiue authority.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sect. 2. before.</NOTE> because (if we seeke to conuert <HI>Atheists</HI>) the testimony of their
owne Writers haue with them farre greater force and power of perswasion,
then the Testimony of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> be they neuer so plaine. And therefore
(saith <HI>Tertullian</HI>) that <HI>De suis instrumentis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. lib. De Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">na. Cap. 7. p. 181.</NOTE> <HI>secularia pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bari, necesse est.</HI> Yea,
and <HI>improbari</HI> too: <HI>Whether we would approue, or reproue the opinion of the
Heathens, we shall doe it most effectually out of their owne writings.</HI> For, <HI>fir|mum
est genus probationis</HI> (saith <HI>Nouatian) quod ab ipso Aduersario sumitur,
vt veritas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nouatian. lib. De Tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">it. cap. 18. Apud Ter|tul. p. 631.</NOTE> <HI>ab ipsis inimicis veritatis, probetur: It is a very forcible kinde of
proofe, which is drawne from the Aduersarie himselfe, when the truth is</HI> proo|ued
<HI>by them that oppose the truth.</HI> Not that the <HI>Atheists</HI> do giue credit to the
<HI>Heathens,</HI> any more then to vs <HI>Christians,</HI> in their direct assertion and affir|mation
of God, (for therein they hold vs both to bee equally vnequall vnto
their cause, and indifferently vn-indifferent vnto themselues;) but yet in their
<HI>Axioms,</HI> belonging to Philosophy, and to other humane Arts, they will be|leeue
them readily, as being Maisters in those Sciences. From which (not|withstanding)
it will follow as necessarily, that there needes must bee <HI>A God,</HI>
as if they had affirmed it, in direct and expresse words; as I purpose (God
willing) to make plaine, in the second of these Bookes.</P>
<P>Fourthly, because (if we seeke to confute the <HI>Atheists</HI>) the testimonies of
the Heathens are the fittest meanes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lactan. l. 1. c. 6. p. 17.</NOTE> that so we may, <HI>eos suorum testimonijs re|uincere,</HI>
(as <HI>Lactantius</HI> aduiseth vs) conuince them by their owne authorities:
<PB N="15" REF="26">
which is the strongest conuiction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrysost. Hom. 3. in Tit. Tom. 4. p. 1614.</NOTE> that can fall vpon them: as is truely ob|serued,
by S. <HI>Chrysostome; Tunc illos</HI> maxime <HI>reuincimus, cum suorum, in eos,

their owne saying against them: alledging this for the reason, why the Apo|stle

And therefore (saith <HI>Lactantius,</HI> in another place) that it is, <HI>satis firmum te|stimonium,

in sunder that band of prophane and wicked <HI>Atheists,</HI> which band them|selues

compelled the wicked <HI>Aegyptians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Muscas, &amp; Ra|nas illis immi|sit; vt rebus vi|lissimis, superbia domeretur. Aug. Tract. 1. in Io|han. Tom. 9. p. 12.</NOTE> by flyes, and frogs, and grashoppers, and
other such like contemptible wormes, to confesse the power of his diuine

generous and worthy: so will we likewise compell these vngodly <HI>Atheists,</HI>
to confesse, <HI>There is a God,</HI> by the arguments and testimonies of the Heathen
Philosophers; not vouchsafing them the writings of the most holy Authors.
Which weighty and important reasons, of my so frequent alledging of pro|phane

with him, throughout this whole Treatise, for my perpetuall defence. The
cause, you see, requireth it: the Aduersary exacteth it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 3.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That there is an inbred perswasion in the hearts of al men, That there is a God.
2. That this hath beene obserued, by many learned men, among the Heathens.
3. That it hath also beene obserued, by diuers learned Christians. 4. Two
notable testimonies out of Tullie; asserting this perswasion, both vnto all
Nations, and vnto all Conditions, and vnto all persons among men.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Haue largely vnfoulded in the two former Chapters, both what manner of
Arguments, and what manner of Authorities, are most proper to this cause,
<PB N="16" REF="27">
and most effectual with our Aduersaries, either to bend them, or to break them.
Let vs therfore now, come on to the laying of them open. Now they be of two
sorts: they b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> either externall or internall Arguments. For as it is true one
way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. in prae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">at Nat. Quaest. p. 3.</NOTE> which is obserued by <HI>Seneca,</HI> that <HI>Deus et extra, et intra, ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t opus suum:</HI>
that <HI>God vpholdeth all his workes, both without them, and within them:</HI> so is it
also true another way, that, <HI>Deus et extra, et intra, tenetur ab opere suo:</HI> that
<HI>God is beheld of all his workes, not onely without them, but also within them:</HI>
Nature her selfe lending vs light, to see the God of Nature, euen in the most
obscure and interior parts of vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>God hath pla~|ted in all men a certaine per|swasion, That there is a God.</HI> Cognitio diuino ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> suit semper in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> p. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>The first Argument then, to proue <HI>There is a God,</HI> is an internall Argu|ment:
and that is taken from a naturall and inbred conclusion, which is gene|rally
ingrafted into the hearts of all men; that surely <HI>There is a God.</HI> This is
the most ancient and generall praenotion, that Nature hath begotten in the
mind of a man. Which naturall perswasion, though it be both bred and borne
together with vs; yet must it needs be a syence of Gods owne planting in vs.
For if it be true, which is affirmed by <HI>Seneca,</HI> that, <HI>Insita sunt nobis omnium
artium semina, sed Magister ex occulto Deus, producit ingenia: That it is God,
that hath implanted in the soule of a man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. lib. 4. De Benfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. c. 6. p. 50.</NOTE> <HI>the first seedes and principles of other
humane Arts:</HI> then must hee needes much more haue implanted in him this
first seede and principle of all religion, which is the proper Art of Gods holy
worshipping: an Art, of which himselfe is the true and onely Obiect. For <HI>Pie|tas,</HI>
is nothing else,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert. vita Ze|nonis p. 248.</NOTE> but onely <HI>scientia Diuini cultus: an arte of worshipping
God aright,</HI> as <HI>Zeno</HI> rightly defineth it.</P>
<P>And therefore, it is not probable, that hee, which hath replenished the soule
of a man, with those notions and conceptions, that are the first seedes of all o|ther
Arts and Sciences, should onely leaue out that which belongeth to him|selfe.
But howsoeuer the Atheist be perswaded in this point, that this inward
perswasion is implanted by God, or not; yet can he not deny, but that there
is in mans heart such an inward perswasion: because, all the world confesseth
it, euery mans experience teacheth it; and all learned men, both of <HI>Christians</HI>
and <HI>Heathens,</HI> doe both know, and acknowledge it.</P>
<P>2 Let me giue you some instance for the demonstration of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Testimonies of Heathens, that all men be|leeue <HI>There is a God.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Plato,</HI> in

preferres the soule of a man, before all other creatures: because none of them
hath any sense of their Creator; none of them vnderstandeth, either that
there is a God; or that he is the maker and Creator of the world, or of those
great good things which therein are contained. <HI>Cuius alterius animalis ani|mus

soule of any other thing know God, to be the maker of euery good thing, but only

lacke all good instruction; yet are further from <HI>Atheisme,</HI> then the <HI>Graecians,</HI>

of institution that depriueth of Religion: which is nothing else, but a na|turall
impression; as immediately giuen, by God, vnto the soule, as the soule is
immediately, by God, vnto the body. So that (<HI>as Caecilius</HI> very truly affirmeth)

<ARGUMENT>
<P>That there is not any Nation, but it hath his Religion. 1. Ancient Histories

A generall surueigh of their Gods, declareth it. 5. A particular surueigh of

</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29">
_YOu have seene before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Nations haue their Gods, by the Testimonies of Histories.</NOTE> how confidently it is affirmed, both by
<HI>Heathens,</HI> and by <HI>Christians; That there is not any Nation but it
hath his Religion; not any People in the world, but that they haue
their God.</HI> Let vs now come to see, how this saying can be pro|ued.
For, it is easie to say any things. But those things that
are sayd, if they be not duly proued, may, with the same facilitie be reiected,
that they be affirmed. So that, we cannot, in equitie, exacte a beleefe, where
we doe not exhibite (if not en exact) yet a competent proofe. But in this
case now present, easie proofe will be competent. For, it requiring nothing
of vs, but an historicall faith, we neede exacte no more, but an historicall
proofe: because historicall positions, are sufficiently proued by historicall pro|bations.
Why then, the highest proofe that wee can vse in this case,
is to confirme it by the testimonie, of either such <HI>Historiographers</HI> as
haue credibly related it, or else, of such <HI>Trauellers,</HI> as haue visibly seene it.
They <HI>two</HI> will be sufficient. <HI>For</HI> these two in this case be more authenticall
witnesses, then either <HI>Philosophers, Orators,</HI> or <HI>Po&euml;ts;</HI> yea or then <HI>Diuines</HI>
themselues: because, this resteth onely vpon the credit of <HI>History:</HI> Wherein
we haue testimonies in very great plenty. For, looke into all the most ancient
<HI>Historiographers,</HI> who haue either <HI>Geographically</HI> described the <HI>Regions,</HI> or
<HI>Histo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ically</HI> the <HI>Nations</HI> of the whole world, so farre as it was open, and
known in their time; &amp; yet you shall finde none of them, that haue certainely
or assertiuely branded any nation with the marke and stigme of <HI>Atheisme&punc;</HI> nei|ther
<HI>Herodotus,</HI> nor <HI>Diodorus,</HI> nor <HI>Strabo,</HI> nor <HI>Ptolomee,</HI> nor <HI>Mela,</HI> nor <HI>Solinus,</HI>
nor <HI>Plinie,</HI> nor <HI>Iustine,</HI> nor any of the rest. They which haue marked, with very
great curiositie, the memorable things of euery Countrie; yea and haue noted
the <HI>Atheisme</HI> of some particular men; would neuer haue lefte it vnnoted vpon
any generall nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diodor. Sicul. l. 13. p. 317.</NOTE> if they could haue inured any such vpon them. It is true
that <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth of the <HI>Cala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ci;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo. lib. 3. p. 328.</NOTE> a rude and a sauage people of <HI>Spaine;</HI> that,

But yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 8. Sect. 3.</NOTE> he neither affirmeth so of them; nor yet telleth vs, who they were that
affirme this of them himselfe; nor yet subscribeth vnto their affirmation: but
leaueth all in the vncertaintie of, <HI>Quida~,</HI> &amp; <HI>aiunt;</HI> which is a very weake proofe.
For, if such vngrounded reports might goe for proofes, <HI>Christians</HI> themselues
should be <HI>Atheists:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arnob. l. 8. cont. gent. p. 748.</NOTE> who (as <HI>Caecilius</HI> reporteth) doe, <HI>et Templa despicere, et

ancient <HI>Scythians.</HI> And, for the <HI>Massagetae</HI> their neighbours; he testifieth of

Among the other Gods they worship the Sun, and they sacrifice their Horses vnto him. So that, in the writings of all the an|cient
<HI>Historiographers,</HI> we cannot, as yet, meete with any Nation of <HI>Atheists:</HI>
vnlesse we should beleeue the fictions of the <HI>Po&euml;ts,</HI> in their reporte of the
<HI>Cyclopes.</HI></P>
<P>2 And the same may be likewise obserued in the <HI>Neoterickes. Munster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All Nations haue there Gods, by the testimoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> of new Histories.</NOTE> in
his <HI>Cosmographie,</HI> hath notably described the vniuersall world, so farre as (in
his time) it was knowne, and inhabited: and <HI>Ortelius,</HI> in his <HI>Theatrum Or|bis;</HI>
hath placed the same, as it were, vpon a Stage, to be plainely seene of all
men: yea and both of these two writers haue deliuered vnto vs, not onely a
<HI>Chorographicall</HI> description of all countries, but also a <HI>Morographical</HI> descrip|tion
of their manners. In all whose large volumes, yet neither of them (so far
as I remember) hath noted any Nation, to be without all Religion; none to
be profest in <HI>Atheisme.</HI> So that, wee cannot finde, by authoritie of <HI>Historie,</HI>
either ancient or moderne, that euer the sinne of <HI>Atheisme</HI> ouerspred any
whole Nation: as yet diuers other sinnes haue done. For, if there had euer
beene any <HI>nation of Atheists,</HI> throughout the whole world, they should surely
haue beene noted. And, if wee can neither see, nor heare, nor reade, that there
were euer any such; why should wee be so light as to beleeue there should be
such?</P>
<P>But, because an argument from Authoritie, doth not follow negatiuely;
let vs goe one steppe further, and proue it affirmatiuely. There be published
to the world, two notable Bookes, of great learning, and good vse. The one
by <HI>Master Samuel Purchas:</HI> which hee calleth his <HI>Pilgrimage:</HI> the other by
<HI>Master Edward Grimestone:</HI> which he intituleth, <HI>The Estates and Empires of
the world.</HI> In both which, are excellently described, not onely the <HI>Geographi|call</HI>
site of all <HI>Regions,</HI> but also the Conditions of all their <HI>Inhabitants:</HI> their
riches, forces, gouernments, commodities, histories; and (amongst the rest)
their <HI>Religions,</HI> Yea, and before the rest, in the first of those two <HI>Authors;</HI> who
maketh their religions, the very first of his purposes; and all the rest but as se|conds
and thirds. So that (by the commendable paynes of those two industri|ous
writers) the <HI>Aheist</HI> cannot name vnto vs any nation, but wee can name
againe vnto him their religion and that they be not of his. Or, if any be
(haply) omitted by them; it is not, because they haue no religion; but, because
their Religion is, as yet, not fully knowne. None are noted, as knowne, to be
without all religion. For all people inhabiting vpon the face of the whole
Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tres sunt in Mundo Religio|nes; Iudaeorum, Paganorum, Christianorum. Athanas. in D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">put. cont.

is relation of two worthy Gentlemen, of this our owne nation: who haue
compassed the Globe of the whole Earth about. Which notable exploit
hath not by any other Nation, as yet, beene twice atchieued. The first of
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eng. Voyag. vol. 3. p. 737. 738.</NOTE> was <HI>Captaine Drake;</HI> who, in his furthest trauell vnto the <HI>North-west,</HI>

who, when they had tasted of our mens liberalitie, they supposed them to bee
Gods, and diuers times offered vnto them their sacrifices. Which they neuer
would haue done, but that both they were perswaded that <HI>There is a God:</HI>
and that, <HI>offering of sacrifice is a part of his worship.</HI></P>
<P>The second of those Gentlemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 819.</NOTE> was <HI>Captaine Candish,</HI> who, in his fur|thest
trauell vnto the <HI>South-East,</HI> taking land in the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Capul,</HI> obserued
the Inhabitants, to be the worshippers of the <HI>Diuell.</HI> And the like may be ob|serued
in diuers other of their voyages: who, euen in the furthest and most
remote parts, could neuer, as yet, finde any Nation of <HI>Atheists.</HI> They neuer
yet tooke landing, but if they once found men, they found also some religion:
which they neuer brought with them when they came; nor carried with them
when they went; but both found it there before them, and left it there be|hind
them. So that, no Traueller could euer out-trauell religion: but, (as

But,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> aboue all, the follie of the <HI>Romanes</HI> doth well deserue the Bell. For they

Which seemeth to me little lesse then a wonder, that the <HI>Romanes,</HI> so wise and

But this sedulitie of mans soule about such false gods, must needs
importe vnto vs, that it thinkes there is a true one. And thus you plainely see
by all the former instances, that there is no Nation so Barbarous, but it will
haue a God, though neuer so ridiculous. Which euidently proueth, that
this one conclusion [<HI>That there is a God.</HI>] is a generall principle, throughout
the whole world, wherein all kinde of people remaine still of one language,

the like no doubt they could easily haue shewed of all the other Nations and

<PB N="27" REF="32">
this also may be gathered, by those <HI>High Places,</HI> which <HI>Salomon</HI> builded for
his <HI>idolatrous Wiues:</HI> wherein they worshiped the seuerall Gods, of their

Wiues, which burnt incense and offered vnto their Gods.</HI> Whereby it ap|peareth,
that euery seuerall Nation had a God of his owne.</P>
<P>As yet further may be seene by the practise of those Nations, which <HI>Sal|manezer</HI>
transplanted into the <HI>Samaritane Cities:</HI> of whom it is recorded,
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 17.</NOTE> <HI>thogh they feared the Lord, yet they worshipped euery one his owne peculiar

<P>Neither did Nations and Cities onely affect, to haue euery one vnto

see in <HI>Plautus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. de. Nat. Deor. p. 210.</NOTE> where, a <HI>Lar familiaris</HI> expresseth his worship thus.</P>

not only seuerall families had their seuerall Gods, but also euery seuerall

<P>And thus, you plainly see, that there is neither Nation, nor
City, nor Family, in the world, but that it is perswaded, that <HI>There is a God;</HI>
and that they cannot containe, but that they needs must worship him, at
the least in their intention, howsoeuer there be error or imperfection in their
action. So that, for the first branch of <HI>Tullies</HI> gradation; you see he erred
not, <HI>That there is not any Nation, but it hath his Religion:</HI> None of them all

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_OF all those generall Notions which are begotten in the minde,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>
and are thought to be the first grounds of the very law of Na|ture;
there is not any one of them, which is either so early bred,

as is this one conclusion; That <HI>There is a God.</HI> Nay, a Conclu|sion
it is not (if we will properly speake) but rather a Principle, yea and that
so naturally bred in the soul: that (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> affirmeth) it needeth not any

point, who agre not in any other, either of <HI>Art,</HI> or <HI>Nature:</HI> not in Lawes: for

yea, and sometime, the very <HI>Israelites</HI> themselues: Not in marriage: for many
haue liued as licentiously,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> and loosely, as if they were bruite beasts, hauing on|ly

<P>For our better &amp; more orderly proceeding wherein,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> I will tread in <HI>Plutarch's</HI>
steps:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> who hath named vnto vs three speciall sorts of men, that are knowne,
of all other, to agree least together: and yet, in this one point, of beleeuing,
<HI>There is a God,</HI> doe so notably consent, as if they all were led but by one and

the same spirit: that is, <HI>Poets, Lawgiuers,</HI> and <HI>Philosophers. Omnes Poetae, Legum|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s,

doe affirme,</HI> There is a God, <HI>with one consenting voyce</HI> (saith he.) Let
vs looke into the parts of this <HI>Enumeration,</HI> and examine the truth of euery
one of them.</P>
<P>And first, concerning <HI>Poets:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 1. Sect 3. All Poets be|leeue, <HI>There is is a God.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> I haue shewed you <HI>before,</HI> that all of them, in
the beginning of their Poems, doe vsually call vpon, either the Gods, or the
Muses: as may easily be demonstrated out of all their writings, especially in
their greater and more solemne workes: and is generally obserued of them,
by <HI>Lucian,</HI> in his booke <HI>De Sacrificijs.</HI> Which euidently proueth, that they
had within them a grounded opinion, that <HI>There is a God.</HI> For no man is so
mad, as to inuocate any thing, that he thinketh hath <HI>no being.</HI> But, as concer|ning
Poets, it is commonly beleeued, both by themselues and others, that
their very Art hath a more speciall and immediate dependence vpon a di|uine
influence, then any other of all the Arts beside. In which point let me de|liuer
vnto you the opinion of <HI>Plato,</HI> who handleth it <HI>ex professo,</HI> in his <HI>Dia|logue</HI>
called <HI>Io:</HI> where he deliuereth expresly, these three positions, vnto vs.
First, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ato. In Ione. p. 170. 171.</NOTE> <HI>Ipsa Musa Poetas diuino instinctu concitat, That the Muses them|selues
doe vse to stirre vp Poets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. lib. 2. Epist: ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. Ep. 12. p. 211. Isa. 6. 6. 7.</NOTE> <HI>by an inward and a diuine instinct:</HI> whereupon
they be called by <HI>Tullie, <GAP DESC="foreign">, A Musis tacti:</HI> or (in some sense) <HI>de coe|lo
tacti;</HI> as the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> was, when as one of the Angels had touched
his lippes.</P>
<P>His second position is, that, <HI>Omnes Poetae in signes, non arte, sed diuino in|flatu,
praeclara poemata canunt: That all notable Poets make their excellent po|ems,
not by vertue of their owne arte, or former instruction, but onely by meanes
of a diuine inspiration.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isidor. lib. 8. O|rig. c. 7. p. 1018.</NOTE> Whereupon they are called <HI>Vates, &agrave; vi mentis</HI> (as <HI>I|sidore</HI>

quodam spiritu afflati.</HI> His third, That therefore <HI>pri&ugrave;s canere non possunt,
quam Deo pleni sint:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Ora. pro. Ar|chia Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ta. p. 365</NOTE> <HI>They be not able to make any po&euml;m, before they be euen fil|led
with the breath and spirit of God:</HI> as Pipes cannot make any musicall har|mony,
if the breath of some Musition be not breathed into them. And there|upon
(in another place) he called them, <HI>Deorum Prophetas:</HI> as S. <HI>Paule</HI> like|wise
doth; that is, the <HI>Prophets of the Gods,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. l. 2. De Repub. p. 548. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">it. 1. 12.</NOTE> or <HI>Speakers</HI> outwardly of those di|uine
things, which before haue inwardly beene inspired into their minds: for
so the name of a <HI>Prophet</HI> signifieth. Whereby he insinuateth, that the whole
faculty of <HI>Poets</HI> dependeth much more vpon a diuine incitation, then either
vpon any naturall gift, or any artificiall instruction and teaching. And this
he there confirmeth, by two obseruations. The first whereof is this, that diuers
of the Poets, being (at their beginning) but very ignorant Bardes; yet haue
had on a suddaine, a notable faculty infused into them, whereby they haue
made very excellent Poems: as in the same place he instanceth in <HI>Tynnichus
Chalcidensis.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Max&punc; Tyr. Serm. 22. p. 264.</NOTE> (And <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> affirmeth the same of <HI>Hesiodus.</HI>) From
whence he there collecteth, <HI>Poetas nihil esse aliud qu&agrave;m Deorum interpretes:
That Poets are nothing else, but onely Gods Interpreters.</HI> The Poems they make
are his; and they, but the Reciters. <HI>Quod quidem Deus ostendere volens, de
industria, per ineptissimum Poetam, pulcherrimam cecinit melodiam</HI> (saith hee
in the same place,) <HI>Which God being willing to make knowne, he purposely in spired
<PB N="30" REF="34">
the simplest Po&euml;t, to make the excellentest poeme.</HI> The second of his
obseruations, is this: That in all Poesie (if it be good and worthy) there
must be, not only an incitation, and commotion; but also an elocation, and
emotion of the minde. The <HI>Poet</HI> must be, <HI>extra se positus, &amp; a mente alie|natus.
Nam quamdi&ucirc; quis mente valet, ne&abque; fingere carmina, ne&abque; fundere
oracula quis quam potest. As long as a man is in a calme, &amp; setled estate of his
mind, he can neither make verses, nor giue out oracles.</HI> From whence he insi|nuateth,
that it is not he himselfe, but his inward God that speaketh. Which
his two obseruations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Argument. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n plat Ion. p. 168.</NOTE> may further be confirmed, by a third of <HI>Ficinus,</HI> in his
Argument of that Booke: That oftentimes, many Poets, when they reade
their owne poems, do hardly vnderstand themselues; or, what they meant,
in many verses, apt enough vnto the matter, and plaine enough vnto their
reader, yea plainer then to themselues: which could not haue fallen out, if
those verses had bin made, by their owne proper spirit, and not by some o|ther,
within them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iust. Martyr. Orat. ad Gent. To. 1. p. 78.</NOTE> yet working far aboue them. And <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> alledgeth
this for one reason, why <HI>Sibilla'es</HI> verses be not made in true members: be|cause,
being spoken in an <HI>extasie, she knew not what she sayd, and that motion
being ended, she could not amend them, hauing not the same spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and euen the <HI>Po&euml;ts</HI> themselues haue the very same perswasion, that
their whole Art dependeth vpon a diuine inspiration. From which only
opinion, groweth all their forenamed so frequent inuocation, to haue their
Gods to breathe into them:

be not the <HI>Makers,</HI> but the <HI>Workers</HI> of their hony, which naturally falleth
with the dew from heauen: so they be not the makers, but the bringers of
their Verses:<NOTE PLACE="marg">As Bees their hony seeke and sucke from euery flowery spring:</NOTE> <HI>instar apum volantes, ad nos afferunt:</HI> (sayth <HI>Plato</HI>) but the

Now they, that are possessed with this religious opinion, that their owne
Art proceedeth from an immediate inspiration; and who vse, in all their
poems, to begin with inuocation; how is it possible, that these men should
be tainted with <HI>Atheisme?</HI> Nay, Poets are so far from the sinne of <HI>Atheisme,</HI>
that they haue bin the chiefest broachers of the sinne of <HI>Polytheisme.</HI></P>
<P>2 Let vs now come to the second of <HI>Plutarch's</HI> instances;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Lawgiuers doe beleeue, That there is a God.</NOTE> that is, vnto
<HI>Lawgiuers;</HI> and see, whether any of them haue beene <HI>Atheists?</HI> or any so vn|godly,
as to be without a God? For which point, it is a thing that is worthy
obseruation, that, though diuers of the <HI>Lawgiuers</HI> haue beene so carried, with
an inward emulation, that, onely vpon meere enuie, they haue often-times
condemned, what their neighbours haue allowed; and often-times allowed,
what their neighbors haue condemned; as we may euidently see, by the con|trary
Constitutions of the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> and <HI>Athenians:</HI> yet, that no enuie,

And therefore, all wise <HI>Lawgiuers</HI> do place those Lawes first, and (as it were)
in the front of their Tables, which they haue ordayned for the honor of
God: and then those that belong to the good of the kingdome:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 20. 3. 32. 15. 16. Deut. 10. 4.</NOTE> as we may
see, in <HI>Moses Lawes,</HI> whose first law is this; <HI>Thou shalt haue none other Gods

of his Lawes: and the same hath likewise beene followed by diuers o|ther
Lawgiuers, euen of the very Heathen. <HI>Zaleucus</HI> beginneth his Lawes

And then he proceedeth to set downe certaine Rites and Ceremonies, for
the worshipping of the Gods, before he praescribe any, for the societie of
men. And so likewise <HI>Tullie</HI> in the setting downe of his Lawes: the first

&amp; to work their people towards them, vnto greater obedience, as <HI>Dio|dorus

who haue fathered their Lawes vpon the Gods: as namely, <HI>Menes,</HI> the

by the ministery of other inferior gods. But vnto <HI>gods</HI> they all ascribe them:
the wiser sort, vnto the Author; the simpler, vnto the Messenger. Whereupon

<HI>Oportet Leges Patriae, tanquam alteros Deos obseruare.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato lib 1. De Leg. p. 746.</NOTE> For, as <HI>Plato</HI>
truely noteth in the very beginning of his Booke. <HI>De Legibus:</HI> It is
<HI>Deus. et n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n Homo, qui legum condendarum est causa. It is not Man, but
God, that is the true cause of the making of good Lawes.</HI> Which honour is a|scribed
to God himselfe, euen in the <HI>holy Scripture:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 8. 15.</NOTE> <HI>By me Kings reigne, and
Princes decree Iustice,</HI> that is, make iust Lawes. Iniustice they may decree
of themselues (and there is a woe pronounced against such <HI>wicked Law-ma|kers</HI>)
but they cannot decree Iustice, but onely by him. So that, it is truely
sayd in <HI>Iob:</HI> that <HI>Nullus ei similis in Legistatoribus: There is none like vnto
him, amongst all the Lawgiuers.</HI> Nay, he is indeed the onely true Lawgiuer;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 36. 22. in. vulgata.</NOTE>
&amp;, in the whole world, there is not another: as the Apostle S. <HI>Iames</HI> plainely
testifieth vnto vs: <HI>There is but one Lawgiuer, who is able to saue, and to destroy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ia. 4. 12</NOTE>
and that is <HI>he.</HI> So that, all other Nations, as well as the <HI>Iewes,</HI> may truly pro|fesse;
<HI>The Lord is our Iudge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 33. 22.</NOTE> and the Lord is our Lawgiuer,</HI> or (as it is in the
<HI>Hebrewes) Statute-maker:</HI> Howsoeuer the Heathen Lawgiuers haue robbed
the true God of that honour, and ascribed it falsely vnto others. But thus you
see, that all Lawgiuers, as it were, by a compact, haue agreed together in this
common sense, to ascribe all their lawes, vnto the making of their Gods. And
therefore, none of them could possibly be <HI>Atheists,</HI> at least in outward profes|sion;
no not euen by <HI>their profession,</HI> in that they were Lawgiuers.</P>
<P>Neither could the people that were vnder them be of any other dispositi|on:
both because of that inward naturall instinct, which inforceth euery man
to worship some God; and because, by nature also, all Subiects are Imitators
of their rulers; and because againe, all rulers praeserue their owne Religion by
coerciue Lawes: as <HI>Iosephus</HI> instanceth in <HI>Socrates, Anaxagoras, Diagoras,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioseph l. 2&punc; cont. Apion. p. 914.</NOTE> and
<HI>Protagoras,</HI> all of them seuerally mulcted for the opinion of their impieties
against the Gods. So that, if any man would not be religious, for loue; yet
durst he not be irreligious, for feare.</P>
<P>3 Let vs now proceede vnto <HI>Plutarch's</HI> third instance, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Philoso|phers beleeue that There is a God.</NOTE> vnto <HI>Philoso|phers;</HI>
and see, whether any of them haue beene <HI>Atheists.</HI> Wherein it cannot
be denied, but that those infamous persons, who haue beene noted by their
name, to be <HI>Atheists;</HI> haue, all of them, beene, by their profession, <HI>Philosophers.</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="36">
But yet this againe may be truly affirmed of them: that, howsoeuer some per|ticular
men of that profession, may haply haue beene infected with <HI>Atheis|me;</HI>
yet that there was neuer any <HI>Sect</HI> or <HI>Familie</HI> of them, but that it was of
a cleane contrary profession. There was neuer any sect of <HI>Philosophers</HI> that
were professed <HI>Atheists:</HI> No, nor yet neuer any, but professed the cleane con|trarie.
And yet, it cannot be dissembled, but that all the <HI>Philosophers</HI> haue
had so infinite auiditie, and appetite of glory; that none of them could say
any thing, though with neuer so great reason, but that some other would
oppose it, and hold the contrary vnto it, were it neuer so absurd. Yea, and
this fell out, as well among their whole families, as amongst priuate per|sons:
the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> perpetually opposing the <HI>Epicures;</HI> the <HI>Peripatetikes,</HI> them
both; the <HI>Academikes,</HI> them all. Insomuch, that their contentions and digla|diatious
grew to be so notorious, as made them all ridiculous: as that bitter
scoffe of <HI>Seneca</HI> very notably declareth; <HI>That, Facili&ugrave;s inter Philosophos, qu&agrave;m
inter horologia convenit: That Philosophers agree together like Clocks.</HI> But yet
in this grand point of acknowledging a God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plus diuersitatis inu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nias inter Philosophos, qu&agrave;m societatis. Tertul. l. de A|nima cap. 2. p. 262.</NOTE> there is amongst them all an in|credible
agreement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. in Ludo, p. 247.</NOTE> Here, the Clocks strike all together. You may see a Cata|logue
of all their opinions, in <HI>Tullies</HI> first Booke <HI>of the Nature of the Gods,</HI>
representing vnto vs so notable a discord, in their particular conceits, <HI>What
this God should be,</HI> that neuer Clocks iarred more: but yet so great a concord,
in their generall opinions, <HI>That a God there is,</HI> as neuer Clocks agreed bet|ter.
There, euery man venteth his owne priuate conceite, what he thought
to be his God: No man denieth him, No man adorneth disputation
against him, Nay, no man so much as once doubteth of him: No not, euen
<HI>Protagoras</HI> himselfe, if he be rightly construed: though his words were rackt
vnto it, and for that cause he exiled. For he said not, that he doubted, whe|ther
there were gods, or no, but, that he would not, as then, dispute, whether
there were any, or no? <HI>De Diuis, ne&abque; vt sint, ne&abque; vt non sint, habeo dicere:</HI> gi|uing
onely a reason of his silent praetrition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. De. Nat. Deor. p. 192&punc;</NOTE> And therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arnob. l. 8. cont. Gent. p. 748. Cap. 8. in sin.</NOTE> <HI>Caecilius</HI> doth

<HI>consult&egrave; potius, qu&agrave;m prophan&egrave; disputare: He spake more warily, then wickedly.</HI>
So that, all these recited doe affirme, <HI>There is a God.</HI> There is no man saith of
God, as some doe of the Soule, <HI>Nihil esse omnin&ograve; Deum, et hoc esse totum
inane nomen:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Tusc. p. 111</NOTE> <HI>That God is a thing of nothing, and that the name of God is but
an empty name:</HI> but they all doe acknowledge both the Name and the Thing.</P>
<P>Now looke into these foure seuerall sects of <HI>Philosophers,</HI> which are the
most noted, and noble of them; and you shall see, that they doe all notably
agree in this, though in very few things else. <HI>Plato,</HI> the father of the <HI>Acade|mikes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato lib. 10. De Leg. p. 870.</NOTE>
not onely affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. l. 11. De pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">parat. c. 6. p. 229.</NOTE> that <HI>There is a God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 33. 11. Iust. Mart. Orat. ad Gent. To. 1. p. 45.</NOTE> but he also confirmeth it, by
inuincible reasons. Yea, and euery where almost, he speaketh so diuinely, of
Gods diuine Maiestie, that (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> reporteth) he was called <HI>Moses At|ticus,</HI>
that is, the <HI>Athenian Moses:</HI> as if he had seene God face to face, as is
reported of the <HI>Hebrew Moses,</HI> as <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> noteth. <HI>Plato perind&egrave; at&abque;

Summum Deum, in ignea essentia esse dicit: Plato, as if he were newly dropt
downe out of heauen, and had there learned exactly those things that are aboue;
he maketh his God to be of a firie substance.</HI> Yea and euen therein also hee a|greeth
<PB N="35" REF="36">
in some sorte, with <HI>Moses: The Lord thy God is a consuming fire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aristotle,</HI> the Father of the <HI>Peripateticks,</HI> affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. de Mun|do. To. 2. p. 1566.</NOTE> not only <HI>That there is
a God;</HI> but also, that he is both the <HI>Maker,</HI> and the <HI>Sauiour</HI> of the world. <HI>Deus,
sine dubio, Seruator omnium est, et Parens eorum, quae in mundo conficiuntur:
God, without all doubt, is both the Conseruer, &amp; Creator of all things in the
world.</HI> A most diuine saying of an Heathen man! And many other the like
there be throughout that whole Booke. Which hath occasioned some men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristotles Booke De Mundo.</NOTE>
to doubt of the credit and authoritie of it, as not being truly his; grounding
vpon but sleight and very weake coniectures. I may not stand to discusse vp|on
euery Authoritie: whether the Booke then alledged be the Authors pro|perly?
For then we should haue so many, and so great digressions, as would
turne to be transgressions. And therefore in all places, I take them, as I finde
them, without any curious or strict examination: knowing, that euen those
Bookes, which are thought to be supposed; yet are, for the most part, both
ancient, and learned: and that, if they appeared in the name of their owne
Authors, they would be no lesse approued, then they be now in theirs, vpon
whom they be fathered: as I could plentifully instance. Yea, and <HI>Viues</HI> con|iectureth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lod. Viues in l. 4. Aug. De. Ciuit. Dei. c. 2. 10. 5. p. 222.</NOTE>
euen in this present instance, that though it were not <HI>Aristotles;</HI>
yet it might be <HI>Theophrastus</HI> his. But, both <HI>Lucius Apuleius,</HI> in his Booke <HI>De
Mundo;</HI> and <HI>Augustinus Eugubinus,</HI> asserteth it directly, vnto <HI>Aristotle</HI> him|selfe:
Yea, and <HI>Eugubinus</HI> affirmeth it to haue beene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucius Apul. l. de Mundo. p. 2.</NOTE> as it were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug Eugu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. l. 4. De peremi Philo+soph. c. 4. p. 176. 177.</NOTE> his <HI>Retractation.</HI>
Wherein he hath both recognized, and epitomized all his owne former wri|tings;
reforming his owne errours: and reporting both the opinions of other
<HI>Philosophers</HI> more truly; and his owne more plainely, then in all his other
workes. But, howsoeuer this be: though this booke were none of his; yet doth
he affirme as much in his <HI>Metaphysikes,</HI> which are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. lib. 1. Me|taphys. c. 2. To. 2. p. 1372.</NOTE> without all quaestion, his.
For there he saith directly, that <HI>Deus est rerum omnium, et cause, et principium:
That God is both the cause, and the beginning of all things.</HI> A direct and plaine
Confession.</P>
<P>So <HI>Zeno</HI> the Father of the <HI>Stoicks</HI> (as <HI>Tully</HI> expressely calleth him) doth
not only beleeue, <HI>That there is a God;</HI> but also, <HI>That there is but one only God:</HI>
and that <HI>he is the Maker and Creator</HI> of the world, who is sometimes called
<HI>Mens,</HI> sometimes <HI>Fate,</HI> sometimes <HI>Ioue,</HI> and by diuers such like names. <HI>Vnum

liuing, euerliuing, reasonable, perfect, and blessed; farre remoued from

<P>And so likewise <HI>Epicurus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mornaeus lib. De verit. Relig. c. 1. p. 15.</NOTE> the Father of the <HI>Epicures: Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m nihil puden|dum

<PB N="36" REF="37">
he affirmeth that: accompting it a lesse absurdity to haue a God that is idle;
then to be so idle, as to haue none at all. Their Notion of the gods was, that
they were <HI>Beati, &amp; Aeterni: sed nec habere ipsos quicquam negotij, nec exhibere

generall Councell, and bid them speak their minde, as concerning God: dost thou
thinke that the Painter would tell thee one tale, and the Caruer another, the Poet

euen of the wisest and learnedest <HI>Philosophers,</HI> who haue founded their

were allowed by them, not holding it any disgrace vnto them.</HI></P>
<P>Insomuch, that it may be obserued, in the most of them, that they doe not
onely retract many opinions in their age, which they defended in their youth,
but also, that almost euery sixe or seuen yeares, they betake them vnto new
opinions. Which hee ascribeth, not so much vnto the imconstancie of their
iudgement; as to a greater experience, &amp; further parefaction of the truth that
reformeth it. But yet, in this one point, of beleeuing there is a God; there is
neither difference of opinion between nation &amp; nation, profession and profes|sion,
person and person; no, nor change of opinion in any singular man: but, as
all men agree in this, in all places; so doth euery man agree with himselfe, at
all times; when he is himselfe, and not, by the violence of inordinate passion,
transported out of himselfe. Onely this change we may obserue: that some
men, who in their youth haue denied God, haue changed their opinion;
and in their age confessed him: as we shall see <HI>hereafter,</HI> in a seueral Chapter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 13.</NOTE>
But no man, that in his youth confessed God, did euer change his opinion. So
that, though the <HI>Philosophers</HI> (as it were a kinde&punc; of <HI>Gentile Pharisies</HI>) desire the

and by <HI>Arnobius,</HI> who setteth downe both their names, and their of|fices:
which, euen without his interpretation, might well be gathered by their
names. So that, there was no Arte or profession, amongst all the Heathen,
but they had both their generall and their speciall gods. And therefore
none of them could possibly be <HI>Atheists.</HI> Much lesse could those Artificers
that are professed <HI>Christians:</HI> of whom <HI>Tertullian</HI> truly writeth, that, <HI>Deum
quilibet opifex Christianus et inuenit, et ostendit. That euery Christian being a
Christian, can easily both finde out and shew forth God.</HI> Besides, it is a thing
that is worthy the noting, that, of all the Arts in the World (though there
be innumerable of them) yet there is not any one that is founded vpon
<HI>Atheisme.</HI> No Arte is grounded vpon this supposition, that <HI>There is no God;</HI>
No Arte dissolued, by beleeuing, <HI>there is a God.</HI> But many Arts and profes|sions
are grounded vpon the contrary supposition; that <HI>There is a God:</HI> and
presently dissolued, by beleeuing, <HI>There is no God;</HI> as all <HI>Priests,</HI> and <HI>Prophets,
Diuiners and Sacrificers,</HI> and all those other Arts, which either depende vpon
<HI>Temples,</HI> or <HI>Altars.</HI> All which as they haue their immediate foundation, in
mens beleeuing, <HI>That there is a God:</HI> So haue they their immediate dissolu|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 10. 25.</NOTE>
in beleeuing <HI>There is no God.</HI> As we may see in <HI>Baals Priests;</HI> it being
once beleeued, that <HI>Baal</HI> was no God; you see how his Priests were all pre|sently
destroyed. And so likewise, when by S. <HI>Pauls</HI> preaching, it beganne to
be beleeued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 19. 24. 25. 26. 27.</NOTE> that <HI>Diana</HI> was no goddesse; in what a feare was <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and
the rest of his Siluer-Smiths, that their Art would be dissolued? So that,
there is no Arte, which either hath his being, by beleeuing <HI>ther is no God;</HI> or,
which loseth his being, by beleeuing <HI>there is a God:</HI> but there be many Arts,
which both haue their being, by beleeuing <HI>there is a God:</HI> and which lose
their being, by beleeuing there is none. And therefore no Artist (as an Ar|tist)
is fit to be an <HI>Atheist:</HI> because religion and piety is the very maintainer
of many Arts immediately; and of all the rest mediately. For all Arts haue
their very being, vpon the coalition of humane society: which if it were
dissolued, all Arts must (by consequent) of necessity perish with it. And pe|rish
it surely would, if religion did not hinder it. For the chiefest tye, and
bond of all humane society, is neither reason, nor speech, nor indigency;
but religion, and piety. <HI>Qua sublata, confusio ac perturbatio vitae sequitur</HI>
(saith <HI>Lactantius) Take but away Religion, and there will follow in mans life,
great disorder &amp; confusion.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lactant&punc; L. De Ira Dei. c. 8 p. 453.</NOTE> Nay the Orator goeth further:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. De Nat. Deor. p. 184.</NOTE> <HI>Haud scio, an pi|etate

depending vpon society, and society it selfe depending vpon religi|on;
it followeth that no Artificer whatsoeuer, can fall into <HI>Atheisme;</HI> but he
needs must dig vp his owne foundation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ficinus Argum. l. 4. Plat. de Legib. p. 782.</NOTE> And therfore <HI>Ficinus</HI> setteth downe

that as there is <HI>Nulla Gens;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. Deor. p. 190.</NOTE> so there is <HI>nullum genus hominum: There is no

<HI>Barbarians,</HI> Learned, nor Vnlearned, Ciuill, nor Rude; None at all (I say)
from the highest Ruler to the poorest Artificer, but they are inwardly per|swaded,
that <HI>There is a God.</HI> So that (as Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> affirmeth in ano|ther

who vse to curse and reuile him. And the third, <HI>Idolaters,</HI> who a|base

yet none of all these, if they duly be considered, can iustly be numbred, as de|nyers
of God. For indeed, all their sinnes are absolutely grounded vpon this
supposition; that <HI>There is a God:</HI> without which they were no sinnes. For,
how should either swearing, or blaspheming, or idolatrizing, be sinne; if there
were not a God, against whom they were committed? Nay, all these seuerall

the same appeareth by that nuncupatiue title, wherewith both <HI>Heathens</HI>
and <HI>Christians</HI> haue honoured their Oathes, in calling their swearing, <HI>an Oath
<PB N="42" REF="40">
of God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. vbi supra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> So <HI>Ennius:</HI>

<P>So <HI>Moses:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 22. 11.</NOTE> <HI>An Oath of the Lord shall be betweene them.</HI> The one of them

that, which they esteemed for their God. Fourthly, the same appeareth by that
Ceremonie, which was commonly vsed, in taking of an Oath; to lay his hand
vpon the Altar, as acknowledging that he spake in the presence of God: and
that he offered vp the inward truth of his soule, vpon the Altar of God. This
Ceremonie <HI>Tullie</HI> mentioneth, in his Oration <HI>pro L. Flacco:</HI> where he saith of

Whereby it appeareth, that it was a common ceremonie amongst the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
to take hold vpon the Altar, when they solemnely sware. Vnto which
Roman custome there seemeth to be a kinde of allusion, in the Gospell of S.

which euen the very Heathens haue placed in Oathes: yea, and that both on
the part of him that taketh it, and of him that exacteth it. First, for the swea|rer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">:

both the truth of God and Men:</HI> as it is censured by <HI>Xenophon:</HI> making
God himselfe a lyer: as auouching of him, as a witnesse vnto their lye. Yea,
and they placed so sacred a Religion in an Oath, that they held it a prophane|nesse,
but euen to dally with it; as bringing the most holy thing into con|tempt:
insomuch, that they condemned <HI>Socrates</HI> vnto death, <HI>nominatim</HI> for
this (among his other crimes) <HI>quia nova iuramenta iurauit</HI> (as <HI>Iosephus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioseph. l. 2. cont. Apion. p. 914.</NOTE> repor|teth)
<HI>because he vsed to sweare by vnlawfull Oathes.</HI> For their vsuall swearing
was, by <HI>Iupiter</HI> and the Gods: as appeareth in <HI>Plautus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plaut. Menech. Act. 5. Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> 7 p. 455.</NOTE>

<P>And againe: <HI>Per Iouem, Deos&abque; omnes adiuro: I sweare by love and all the

<P>But <HI>Socrates</HI> was wont to sweare by a Dogge: <HI>per Canem:</HI> as appeareth in
<HI>Plato.</HI> Which prophanation of an Oath, they interpreted, as an impiety a|gainst
their Religion: and therefore, that (in piety) they oug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t to condemne
him. And, as they reposed great Religion in an oath, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Actor:
so did they likewise, respect of the Exactor: accounting it a kinde of pro|phanenesse
in any man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us. serm. 27. p. 194.</NOTE> when an Oath was orderly performed, not to giue cre|dit
to it: as <HI>Stobaeus</HI> collecteth out of <HI>Antiphanes:</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;C&ugrave;m aliquis contemnit iurantem&punc;</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="40">

<L>Whos'ere he be, contemnes a man, when taking solemne Oath:</L>
<L>He doth contemne, not man, but God; nor God and man; them both.</L></Q>
And therefore, <HI>Menechmus,</HI> in the fore-alledged place, when hee had taken
his Oath:

<L>I sweare by Ioue and all the Gods, good wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plaut. Men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ch. Act. 4. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e. 2. p. 439.</NOTE></L></Q>
He addeth immediately:
<Q><L>Satin' hoc est tibi?</L>
<L>Let this suffice, for ending of our strife.</L></Q>
Pleading, that hauing so religiously protested, he ought to be beleeued. For,
as the reuerence of God ought to adact the <HI>Swearer,</HI> to the speaking of the
truth: so likewise, the Hearer, to the beleeuing of the truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 6. 16.</NOTE> <HI>An Oath ought to be
the stinting of all strife.</HI></P>
<P>Sixtly, the same appeareth by a secret Religion, which entreth into the
Swearer himselfe, euen in the taking of his Oath. And that is twofold: the
one towards men; the other towards God. Both obserued by <HI>Soph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cles,</HI> in
one and the same sentence.
<Q><L>Apposito iureiurando, cautior &amp; diligentior</L>

<L>For then he dreads this double forfeyture,</L>
<L>T offend his friends, &amp; sin against the gods.</L></Q></P>
<P>Seuenthly, the same appeareth, because that euery Oath hath a secret execra|tion
annexed to it, and a curse against the swearer, if he sweare not the truth,
For (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> truly noteth) <HI>Omne iusiurandum in ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">crationem peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rij

<L>He was cast downe the Scale with such a fling,</L>

<P>By all which weighty Reason, both out of the Heathen writers, and out
of <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> it euidently appeareth, that all men in their swearing, both
presume, <HI>There is a God;</HI> and that he truely heareth, whatsoeuer is spoken; and
that he will reuenge him, of the impietie of those men, that by their false
swearing dishonour his holy name. And therefore, no Swearer can be pos|sibly
an <HI>Atheist,</HI> euen by the very nature of his owne proper act, if hee thin|keth
as he sweareth. For the very act of swearing, presupposeth there is a
God, not onely in the inten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the exactour, but also in the extension of
the performer, be hee whosoeuer; yea though the veriest <HI>Atheist,</HI> that euer
liu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d in the world. For, though in his heart, he may (haply) beleeue <HI>there
is no God:</HI> yet, in his act, he would seeme to beleeue, <HI>there is one:</HI> euen by
his action of swearing, he would haue other men to beleeue, that he belee|ueth,
<HI>there is one.</HI> Because, the congruitie of very Reason requireth, that he,
which sweareth by God, should certainely beleeue, that <HI>There is a God,</HI> to
by sworne by: or else he sweareth vainely. Nay, he that sweareth by God, if
he thinke that there is none, disableth the very force of his owne asseueration
For, no man would euer sweare, but to be the better beleeued for his Oath.
But, he that desireth to be beleeued for his swearing by God, if hee thinke,
<HI>There is no God,</HI> is as vtterly absurd, as if he should desire, that men should
beleeue him, when he professeth before hand, that hee sweareth <HI>by nothing:</HI>
and, as impu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, as if he should request them; <HI>I pray you to beleeue me, for
I sweare (By nothing) that this I say is true.</HI> His iust reward in swearing by
nothing, should be to be beleeued in nothing. Thus Swearers (as you see)
if they properly be Swearers, they cannot properly be <HI>Atheists:</HI> the very
action of swearing, destroying directly the opinion of <HI>Atheisme.</HI> And there|fore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristoph. in Nu|bibus. Act. 1. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e. 3. p. 168.</NOTE>
whereas <HI>Socrates, in Aristophanes,</HI> professed, <HI>that he beleeued not the vsu|all
gods: Strepsiades</HI> presently replyed, <HI>Quomodo iuratis igitur? An per num|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
ferreos, si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ut Bizantij? How then doest thou sweare, if thou beleeue not the
gods? Doest thou sweare, like a Bizantian, by their yron pence?</HI> Accompting it
most iustly, for a very grosse absurditie, that any man should outwardly
sweare by the gods, that inwardly beleeueth, that <HI>there is no God:</HI> or, that any
man should sweare by any thing, but onely by God. And therefore, when
<HI>Toxaris</HI> the <HI>Scythian</HI> sware, <HI>Per Ventum, et Acinacem: M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">esippus</HI> derided him
for swearing by such things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucian in Toxa|ri. p. 192.</NOTE> as were no gods: but he defended himselfe, that
among the <HI>Scythians,</HI> those two were held for gods. So that it appeareth by
the concurring opinion both of the reprehender, and of the reprehended,
that nothing is to be sworne by but onely God And consequently that all
Swearers must presuppose <HI>There is a God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All Blasphe|mers doe be|leeue There is a God.</NOTE></P>
<P>3 And the like may be also sayd of <HI>Blasphemers,</HI> that is, of such as are <HI>Re|uilers</HI>
or <HI>Cursers</HI> of God: for vnto that vse onely the word is now restrayned:
as S. <HI>Augustine</HI> hath <HI>obserued:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g. l. 2.

<PB N="45" REF="41">
is to speake any euill of good. But now commonly, Blasphemie is to speake
onely euill of God. For of Men, we may doubt, whether they be euill or good: But
of God we cannot doubt, but that he must needs be good.</HI> So that, the word <HI>Blas|phemie</HI>
hath two significations: the one a lardger, which is to <HI>speake euill of
good:</HI> the other a stricter, which is to <HI>speake euill of God.</HI> Against the first of
those Blasphemies, God hath pronounced a woe: <HI>Woe vnto them that speake
good of euill, and euill of good:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay: 5. 20. Ex. 22. 28.</NOTE> but against the second of them, he hath or|dayned
a Law: <HI>Thou shalt not rayle vpon the gods:</HI> no not, vpon the earthly
gods, much lesse vpon the heauenly. Yea and that vnder a penaltie: <HI>Whosoeuer

for so the <HI>Chaldee Paraphrase</HI> readeth it: <HI>Sustinebit poenam suam:</HI> Yea and that
seuerely too. For it followeth, in the next words, <HI>He that Blasphemeth the name
of the Lord, shall be put to death; the Congregation shall stone him.</HI> The executi|on
of which Law, we may reade in the same place: where the <HI>sonne of the Is|ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">litish
woman was stoned for blaspheming;</HI> giuing occasion very iustly, of the
making of that notable Law against Blasphemie. Wherein we may obserue,
that the Blasphemer was no <HI>Atheist.</HI> And that, by two reasons: the one
drawne from his person; the other from his action. For first, for his person: he
is sayd to haue beene the sonne of an <HI>Israelitish woman,</HI> and of an <HI>Aegyptian:</HI>
by neither of which parents hee could be instituted in <HI>Atheisme.</HI> For first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">4&punc; 10.</NOTE>
for the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gyptians;</HI> they were so farre from being <HI>Atheists,</HI> that they were of
all other the most palpable <HI>Polytheists.</HI> And for the <HI>Israelites;</HI> though they
were the worshippers of <HI>an invisible God;</HI> yet had hee shewed amongst them
so many visible signes of his omnipotent power and goodnesse, as that hee
was confessed, euen by the very Heathens: and therefore could not be denied
by any of the <HI>Israelites.</HI> Blaspheme him they might (as this <HI>Israelite</HI> in his
furie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 2. 10. 11.</NOTE> and impatience did) but denie him they could not; the euidence of his
wonderous workes was so great. And this is the first reason, why hee could
not be an <HI>Atheist.</HI> The second is this: that this Law against Blasphemie,
being made by occasion of this Blasphemers fact, and forbidding onely that,
which he had committed, doth euidently shew that hee was not an <HI>Atheist.</HI>
For then, the Law would haue runne against the denying of God: <HI>Whosoeuer
denieth God, let him be stoned.</HI> But, because this mans sin was not a denying vn|to
God a being (which is the sin of <HI>Atheisme</HI>) but a cursing of that God whom
he beleeued to be; therefore the law was made, not against the denying, but a|gainst
the cursing of God: <HI>He that blasphemeth the name of God, shall be stoned.</HI>
And therefore, <HI>blaspheming</HI> doth not suppose a denying, nor the blashemer,
vpon neccessitie, to be a denyer of God. Nay, indeede, it directly supposeth the
contrary: it supposeth there is a God: As may plainly be collected, both by the
beginning &amp; the end of that irreligious passion, which begetteth in them the
sin of blaspheming. For, first, from the beginning of their passion: it is a sodaine
anger conceiued against God, vpon a supposition, of either some euill re|ceiued
from him, or of some good denied by him. For <HI>blasphemare</HI> (as <HI>Aquinas</HI>
defineth it) <HI>est contumeliam vel conuitium inferre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquin. 2. 2. quaest. 13. Art. 1. p. 29. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>in iniuriam Creatoris:
To blaspheme, is, to offer, either contumelie, or obloquie, by way of dishonor, vnto
the Creator.</HI> Which necessarily supposeth, that he needs must haue a being.
Otherwise, hee must needes confesse, that hee is angry with <HI>Nothing:</HI> and
<PB N="46" REF="42">
so might,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homer. l. 9. Odyss. p. 66.</NOTE> as iustly be derided, as that foolish <HI>Polyphemus,</HI> who raued for
that wrong that was done to him by <HI>Nullus.</HI> Againe, the same may be col|lected,
from the ende of their passion: which is, desperately to prouoke
God to be angry with them: because they before haue beene angred by him,
and so to quitte him with his owne. Which likewise must needes inferre,
that they thinke he hath a being. For, otherwise, they should be as vtterly ab|surd,
as if they should endeauour to moue <HI>Nothing,</HI> vnto anger; spending all
their rayling, as foolishly against him, as the Doggs doe their barking, when
they howle against the Moone. And therefore it followeth not, that though
some men doe Blaspheme, and raile against God; that therefore they thinke
that there should he none: but rather, that there is one: Which they ma|nifestly
acknowledge, euen in their very rayling; vnlesse, they will make
themselues to be knowne for noted-fooles. Who would raile vpon a thing,
which they thinke to haue no being? Yea, and diuers of the Heathens were
so farre from supposing, that rayling and blaspheming should inferre, there is
<HI>no</HI> God; that they made it the essentiall worship of diuers of their gods. For
<HI>Nazianzene</HI> reporteth it of the <HI>Lindianes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazianz. Orat. 47. p. 770.</NOTE> that they worshipped their <HI>Her|cules,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. l. 2. c. 7. P. 3.</NOTE>
onely with railings: <HI>Deum illum, non alio, qu&agrave;m conuitiorum et male|dictorum
honore, afficientes:</HI> And <HI>Plinie</HI> reporteth the same, of their god|desse
<HI>Fortune: Conuitijs colitur. Shee is worshipped with rayling and blasphe|ming.</HI>
And therefore Blasphemie doth not inferre impietie: Nor, that hee
which blasphemeth God, must of necessitie denie God. For, of necessitie hee
granteth him, though of impotencie hee blaspheme him. So that, neither
common <HI>Swearers,</HI> nor yet <HI>Blasphemers,</HI> be <HI>Atheists.</HI> That they be great of|fenders,
it cannot be denied: but that they be <HI>Atheists,</HI> it cannot be affirmed.
Their sinne is not <HI>Atheisme:</HI> it is of another kind. The <HI>Blasphemer,</HI> is not
<HI>Atheus,</HI> but rather <HI>Antitheus:</HI> as <HI>Lactantius</HI> speaketh. And his fault is not
<HI>Atheisme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lactant. l. 2. c. 9. p. 103.</NOTE> or lack of religion; but outrage against the true Obiect of religion.
Which yet (in a large acception) may be called <HI>Irreligion:</HI> though it bee
not a priuation of all religion; because it is an impugning of the true religi|on.
For, as <HI>Tertullian</HI> affirmeth of the <HI>Romanes: Non mod&ograve; n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gligendo, quin

<P>4 Let vs now come to <HI>Idolaters:</HI> which is the third of our instances: and
see,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>All</HI> Idolaters <HI>doe beleeue,</HI> That there is a God.</NOTE> whether they can be numbred as <HI>Atheists.</HI> But that indeed they cannot,
their very profession is against it. For what can be more distant, then <HI>Po|lytheisme,</HI>
and <HI>Atheisme?</HI> then impietie, and idolatrie? I meane priuatiue impi|etie,
which depriueth men wholy, of all sense of Religion. <HI>Idolaters</HI> bee
<HI>Polytheists</HI> and therefore not <HI>Atheists.</HI> They worship many gods: and
therefore they cannot denie, <HI>that there is a God.</HI> Nay <HI>they</HI> must needs
confesse one, that admit many. <HI>They</HI> cannot exclude one, that confesse
many. And therefore, (as I sayd before, of <HI>Swearers,</HI> and <HI>Blasphemers</HI>) so
may I now, of <HI>Idolaters:</HI> that they are taught, by their profession to denie
and renounce <HI>Atheisme;</HI> and by it strictly tyed, to beleeue <HI>There is a God.</HI>
As we may euidently see, in all the seuerall degrees of <HI>Idolatry.</HI> For, would
a man euer worship, either the <HI>Sunne,</HI> or the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">one,</HI> or the <HI>Starres;</HI> as did the
<PB N="47" REF="42">
most Nations both of <HI>Greekes</HI> and <HI>Barbarians</HI> (which diuers of the Hea|thens

<HI>There is a God?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Ciuili. p. 205.</NOTE> Surely, he neuer would. But it may be alledged; that hap|ly,

them to worship them; then did the strength of this inward conclu|sion.
For much is insinuated in the booke of <HI>Wisdome:</HI> where hee both re|porteth,
and reproueth this opinion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. de Nat. Deor. p. 215. Haec tanta opera Deorum sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and yet partly excuseth those, that were

<HI>Idols,</HI> that are of mans making. But, to take away this excuse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wis. 13. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> which is
grounded vpon their beauty; would a man euer worship the <HI>Fire,</HI> the <HI>Water,</HI>
the <HI>Earth,</HI> and the <HI>Aire</HI> (as the <HI>Persians</HI> did) but vpon this perswasion, that,
<HI>There is a God?</HI> These be not of such blazing beauties. But it may be sayd
againe: that, though not the beauty; yet the commodity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo. l. 15. p. 525.</NOTE> which men re|ceiue

gods. For, that was <HI>Prodicus</HI> his opinion (at the least his relation) <HI>That
whatsoeuer thing was profitable vnto the life of man, might iustly be reckoned,
as his God.</HI> Therefore to take away this Obiection also: Would a man euer

<HI>That there is a God?</HI> These be not things of profit. But yet, euen for
these things, something may be sayd: namely, that, though it were not the
hope of any profit by them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch l. 1. de Placitis Phi|losoph. c. 6. To. 2. Mor. p. 13.</NOTE> yet was it the feare of receiuing hurt from them,

profit by them; and they serued others, to escape euill from them.</HI> Well, be it so.
Yet hereby it appeareth, that, euen the very Heathen, in worshipping things
of so diuers natures, were inwardly perswaded in their mindes; that the nature
of God was glorious, and therefore to be honoured; liberall, and therefore to
be loued; powerfull, and therefore to be feared: which manifestly argueth,
that they beleeued, there was a God. But, to remoue all those Obiections
at once, wherein those fore-named considerations, may seeme to be the
ground of their Religions; and, to instance where none of all these can be
found, but where onely the hidden sense of this inward conclusion, that
<HI>There is a God,</HI> doth carry the whole sway: would a man euer worship a
<HI>Stocke,</HI> or a <HI>Stone,</HI> made by his owne hand in some artificiall forme; but that
this is a burning conclusion in his heart, <HI>That there is a God?</HI> This woodden
god, can haue neither any glory, to allure him; nor any profit, to perswade
him; nor any feare, to constraine him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wise. 13. 13.</NOTE> For (as the wiseman teacheth) it is

may yet be obiected: that the artificiall beauty, and workmanship of the

but that they are perswaded, that <HI>a God there is?</HI> This God hath neither
forme, nor beauty, to allure them to worship him. No forme; for it is <HI>in|formis.</HI>
No beauty; for it is <HI>rudis,</HI> as <HI>Lactantius</HI> noteth. Whereas euerie
God ought to haue such perfect beauty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> 1. de Nat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> p. 194.</NOTE> that <HI>Tully</HI> reckoneth it as a foule ab|surdity,
not onely that any other thing should be more beautifull then God;
but also, that among the gods, any one of them should be more beautifull
then another. They ought all so to excell in the highest degree of beauty.
And therefore so rude and vnformed a god, as this <HI>Terminus</HI> is, a man
would neuer worship; but that hee must needs bee worshipping of some
God; and so, not knowing what is best to worship, hee worshippeth that
which is neerest vnto hand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. l. 1. de Nat. Deor p. 200.</NOTE> And therefore (as <HI>Tully</HI> defineth of <HI>Atheists</HI>) that
it is vnpossible, for any of the~ to be superstitious: so it is true in <HI>Idolaters</HI> (who

For, <HI>Idolaters</HI> yeeld two Arguments, which necessarily conclude, that

pride) he giueth it not where it is due; he leaueth him (through his basenes,)

<P><HI>_PLutarch,</HI> in his first booke <HI>Of the Opinions of the Philosophers,</HI> af|firmeth,
that the first propagation of Religion among men, and
the first spreading of this opinion, as concerning God, hath bin

the authority of Magistrates.</HI> And it is true indeed, that (for <HI>traditionall di|uinity</HI>)
it was among the Heathens especially propagated, by some one of
these three meanes. But there was a naturall <HI>Theologie,</HI> ingrafted in the soule
before them all: <HI>ante omnem rationis vsum</HI> (as <HI>Iamblicus</HI> affirmeth) <HI>euen be|fore
all vse of reason,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iamblic. l. De Myster. c. 1. p. 5.</NOTE> <HI>and all capacity to receiue instruction:</HI> whereby they were
disposed, and in a sort prepared, to admit any one of the fore-named instru|ctions,
though it came but single of it selfe. But in the former discourse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 5. Sect. 1.</NOTE> I
haue ioyned them all together: shewing, by a generall consent of all <HI>Philoso|phers,</HI>
all <HI>Poets,</HI> and all <HI>Lawgiuers,</HI> that <HI>There is a God.</HI> So that there is not so

to make but a mock, and a scorne of all Religion: as though this generall

<P>2 But, that Conclusion doth not follow from this dissension. It infringeth
neither the generalitie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dissension of men about God doth not conclude <HI>That there is no God.</HI></NOTE> nor yet the veritie of this notion, <HI>That there is a God:</HI>
Nay, indeed it confirmes them both. For first, as concerning the generalitie
of it; that followeth, by necessitie, vpon the affirmation of the particularitie.
<HI>Qui Socratem dicit, Hominem dicit. He that affirmeth Socrates to be, hee must
needs affirme, a man to be because, Socrates is a man.</HI> And so, hee that affirmeth
either <HI>Iupiter,</HI> or <HI>Apollo,</HI> or <HI>Mars,</HI> or <HI>the Sun,</HI> or <HI>Moone,</HI> or <HI>Stars,</HI> or any other
particular either <HI>Person,</HI> or <HI>Thing,</HI> to be a God; he must needs, by consequence
affirme the generall, <HI>That there is a God.</HI> Yea, and though a thousand should
dissent, as concerning this or that particular God; yet, if euery one of them
doe name some one particular God, though he denie all the rest; yet, euen in
that one particuler, hee must needes conclude the generall, that <HI>There is a
God.</HI> As for example: if one man should say, that <HI>Socrates</HI> were no Philoso|pher,
but yet grant that <HI>Plato</HI> is; another, that <HI>Plato</HI> were none, but yet that
<HI>Aristotle</HI> is one; another, that <HI>not he,</HI> but <HI>Xenocrates;</HI> and so <HI>in infinitum:</HI> all
these agree in the generall, that <HI>A Philosopher there is:</HI> though they disagree
in the particular, <HI>Who he is.</HI> And so it is likewise, in the opinions of the Hea|thens,
as concerning their gods. Though they particularly denie this, or that
thing, to be God; yet, in affirming some other particular, they doe generally

that particular, doth not argue a consent, in destroying of the generall; no nor
a dissent of any one of them from that; but a generall consent in it. As well
may bee obserued, both in <HI>Tullie,</HI> and <HI>Plutarch:</HI> who, in the same sentence

that they did not, <HI>ex compacto,</HI> agree all together, by an excogitated and

that there should not haue bene found the least note of diuersity) so may we
likewise collect, from the dissension of the Heathen, in the particular <HI>Hypo|thesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
of this or that God; that their consent in the <HI>Thesis,</HI> of hauing some
God, must needs be the voice of truth: in that one nation did not borrow
their opinion from another; for then they would haue accorded better, and
that God which one had, the rest would all haue followed. But now, there
being such a iarre and contention among them, as concerning their particu|lar
gods, euery one of them scorning the gods of another; and yet in the
generall, agreeing all together, <HI>That some God they will haue;</HI> this sheweth (as
the Orator very wisely collecteth) that, <HI>Hoc non collocutio hominum, aut con|sensus

Nature: That this opinion of hauing a God, is not begotten in the mindes of
men, either by conference or consent of one Nation with another; not yet im|planted
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n them, by the Lawes and discipline of their owne priuate Nation;
but it is inwardly begotten, by that generall Nature, which they haue all in com|mon.</HI>
It is a Principle of Nature, which is equally imprinted into the
mindes of them all, none following by imitation anothers example. For, it
cannot be the policie of the <HI>Greekes,</HI> or <HI>Romanes,</HI> or other ciuiller Nations,
that hath so largely diffused this opinion of God: because wee see the most
barbarous Nations, who neuer had trade or commerce with them, yet to bee
possessed with this same opinion. Againe, it cannot be the rudenesse of the
barbarous Nations (abused in their ignorance) that hath dispersed it so wide:
because we see the ciuill learned Nations to be possessed of it likewise; who
would scorne to take vp their opinion of the barbarous. The learned Na|tions
<HI>would</HI> not borrow their opinion of the rude, whom they held in such
contempt: and the ruder <HI>could</HI> not borrow their opinion of the learned,
from whom they were so distant. For how could the opinions of the <HI>Greekes,</HI>
or <HI>Romanes,</HI> pierce into the extreamest <HI>India's:</HI> where their names were neuer
heard? especially into the Westerne <HI>India's?</HI> Where yet, they haue their
gods. Therefore the Orator directly concludeth, that <HI>c&ugrave;m non instituto ali|quo,

grounded vpon any instruction, any custome, any law; but that all men do con|sent

There is a God: <HI>because there is so generall a notion of him, not grafted</HI> into
<HI>our minds, but naturally bred</HI> in <HI>our mindes.</HI> So that this great variety of
idolatrous Nations, in their particular opinions, as concerning their proper
and peculiar gods, is rather an argument of the verity of that generall con|clusion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de Iside. To. 2. p. 190.</NOTE>
<HI>That there is a God;</HI> then of the falsity of it. As <HI>Plutarch</HI> likewise
insinuateth, from the very same grounds: where he saith, that it is <HI>vetustissi|ma

an vncertaine Author, but yet beleeued with a most certaine faith; not founded
vpon rumors, but vpon the generall practice both of Greekes and Barbarians, in

Prouidence.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in the same booke, is so farre from conclu|ding,
from the dissension of Nations about their seuerall gods, that therefore
<HI>There is no God;</HI> that he rather collecteth from this their dissension, that
they all intended, <HI>That there was but One:</HI> and that all, with ioynt consent,
had a purpose to worship him; though in those diuers Countries hee were
called by diuers names; as the <HI>Sunne</HI> is, and the <HI>Moone:</HI> Which yet, in their

it. 3. The same Obiection answered.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I HAVE shewed the generality of this naturall praenotion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 3. &amp; 4.</NOTE>
<HI>That there is a God,</HI> by the vniforme consent of all the Nations
of the world, both <HI>ciuill</HI> and <HI>barbarous;</HI> both <HI>Christians, Iewes,
Mahometans,</HI> and <HI>Gentils.</HI> By the like consent againe, of all sorts

persons; yea, euen of those that may seeme to be Gods directest ene|mies;
namely, <HI>Swearers, Blasphemers,</HI> and <HI>Idolaters.</HI></P>
<P>All these consent in this, to beleeue, <HI>That there is a God;</HI> as in the
short <HI>Epitome</HI> of our humane <HI>Creede.</HI> And this I haue confirmed by a <HI>cloud
of witnesses,</HI> both <HI>Grecians,</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> both <HI>Christians,</HI> and <HI>Pagans.</HI> So that
he, which dare gain-say a thing so generally receiued, and set himselfe to stand
against so strong a torrent, may iustly be censured to bee impudent: and that
(as <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> noteth him) hee doth <HI>omnem exuere verecundiam
aduersus veritatem:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Clem. Alex. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 5. Strom. p. 274.</NOTE> <HI>He shaketh off all shamefastnesse, against the truth.</HI> But yet,
if we will be equall iudges, and esteemers of matters, we must be content, to
heare, as wel what can be said against them, as what can be said for them. Now
against the generality of this consent alledged, there be three exceptions ob|iected
by the <HI>Atheist.</HI> The first, that there is no such generall consent, as is pre|tended;
no not, euen among Nations, and much lesse, among persons. The
second, that if there were, yet were not this a naturall, but an artificial consent.
The third, that there haue alwayes beene some men of a contrary opinion,
who could not be denyed to haue beene very learned, and counted among
the number of <HI>Philosophers:</HI> howsoeuer by them blemished with the name of
<HI>Atheists.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 1. de Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|cit. c. 7. To. 2. Mor. p. 14.</NOTE> All which Obiections must both be opened and answered, before

It is familiarly knowne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Atheists</HI> Reasons that al men beleeue not <HI>There is a God.</HI></NOTE> vnto those that are conuersant in the writings of <HI>Tullie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. De Nat. Deor. p. 190.</NOTE> that <HI>he,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 192.</NOTE> oftentimes, vnder the per|son
of an <HI>Academick,</HI> doth play the part of a very <HI>Atheist.</HI> Hee bringeth this
praecognition and anticipation of God, as a very good argument, to proue,
<HI>There is a God:</HI> and <HI>he</HI> againe bringeth Exceptions against it, seeking vtterly
to disable it, playing so vpon both sides, and abusing the liberty of that licen|tious
profession (which was to speake for and against euery thing) to the vtter
ouerthrow of all Religion. And he beginneth with the infringing of this na|turall
praenotion, which is the first foundation of all piety and Religion. The
summe of his exception against it, is this. That it is, <HI>c&ugrave;m leue per se, tum etiam
falsum: That it is, both a light argument, and a false.</HI> The lightnesse of it, hee
lightly ouerpasseth: but vpon the falsenesse of it, he somewhat more insisteth.
And that he seeketh to proue by these foure reasons. First, because we cannot
know the opinions of all Nations. <HI>Vnde tibi notae sunt opiniones Nationum?</HI>
Secondly, because he was verily perswaded, that there were diuers Nations,
which had no opinion of God. <HI>Multas esse gentes sic immanitate efferatas, vt
apud e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s, nulla suspicio Deorum sit.</HI> Thirdly, by the naming of diuers speciall
<HI>Atheists,</HI> that openly denied, that <HI>There was a God:</HI> where he pointeth vpon
<HI>Diageras, Theodorus,</HI> and <HI>Protagoras.</HI> And fourthly, by the instance of sacrile|gious
and periured persons, and such like wicked liuers: who, if they had be|leeued,
that there were a God, they would neuer haue dared to be so impious
and wicked.

This is the short summe of his whole Obiection.</P>
<P>3 Let vs now come to answer it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eists</HI> Reasons a|gainst the ge|nerall consent in Religion, answered: <HI>Cic. l. 1. Tusc. p.</HI> 112.</NOTE> and euery part of it. And first, for his
<HI>Leve,</HI> that it is <HI>but a light argument:</HI> I am sure, that this is but a light answer
vnto it. An answer, then which there cannot be a lighter: which hee would
neuer haue giuen, if he had had a better. Hee himselfe, in another place, ma|keth
this argument as weighty, as here he makes it light. <HI>Firmissimum hoc est
cur Deos esse credamus: qu&ograve;d nulla gens tam est fera, nemo omnium tam imma|nis,
cuius mentem non imbuerit Deorum opinio. This is the strongest argument,
that can possibly be brought, why we should beleeue, that there is a God: because
there is no Nation so vnciuill, no person so vile, whosi mind is not possessed with
the opinion of some God:</HI> Here you see no light account made of this Argu|ment:
but a great and weighty testimony for the weightines of it. And there|fore,
all the lightnesse is rather in the disputant, then it is in the Argument,
that turne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h off that so lightly, which he here esteemes so weighty. This is
lightnesse indeed. For if he had any weight, when he alledged it for weigh|ty;
then hath not it, but he lost his weight, when he accounts so lightly of it:
contrarying his owne praeceeding iudgement. So that the same censure,
which he passeth of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> may as iustly be passed vpon himselfe: that
<HI>Quanuis fuerit acutus vt fuit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 4. Acad. p. 22.</NOTE> <HI>tamen inconstantia leuatur authoritas:</HI> that
<HI>though he were very witty (as he was indeed most certainely) yet by his inconstan|cy,
he lighted his authority.</HI> And therefore, passing ouer his <HI>Leve</HI> thus lightly,
let vs now come to his <HI>Falsitie,</HI> that it is not onely <HI>Leve,</HI> but also <HI>Falsum:</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="47">
which may truly be affirmed to be a false Exception.</P>
<P>But yet this he seekes to proue, by foure seuerall Arguments: vnto which
it is behooffull, to giue their seuerall answers. The first whereof is this, That
we cannot come to know the opinions of all Nations: and therefore cannot
say, that all agree in one. But, vnto this I answer, that we may as surely know
the Religions of all Nations, as they can know their Regions. For the same
meanes, which can serue to instruct vs in the one, can with the same facility in|struct
vs in the other. For, whereby doth the <HI>Atheist</HI> know, that there be such
and such Countries, <HI>Scythians, Barbarians, Indians,</HI> and other such like Nati|ons,
whose eyes he neuer saw? If he answer, that he knoweth it by the credible
relations of <HI>Histories,</HI> and <HI>Trauellers,</HI> that haue seene them with their eyes:
we may answer him againe, That by the selfe same Authors wee know also
their Religions: yea, and their generall consent, in this generall ground, that
they all will haue a God:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 4.</NOTE> as I haue already proued.</P>
<P>Now, for his second proofe; that there be such sauage Nations, as hee ve|rily
is perswaded, not to haue so much as the least conceit of God: as hee af|firmeth
it very weakely, <HI>Equidem Arbitror:</HI> so he confirmes it much
more weakely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 4. Sect. 1.</NOTE> naming not so much as one; which evidently proueth,
that he had not one to name. for else, he would as well haue recited the seue|rall
names of particular Nations, as he doth, in the next, of particular persons.
And we may note the same defect in <HI>Plinie</HI> likewise:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. l. 2. c. 7. p. 2.</NOTE> who saith, that, <HI>Alijs est
nullus Deorum respectus: that with some there is no respect, no reuerence at all
of God.</HI> But yet he nameth none (though he affirmeth <HI>some</HI>) neither there,
nor yet throughout his whole Booke; though in all other matters, he be most|ly
very curious. But indeed, he could not name any particular Nation: and
therefore contents himselfe with this generall assertion, of <HI>Alijs;</HI> without ad|ding

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The second Obiection, against this vniuersalitie of Consent, vnfoulded: That
Religion is no better, but an humaine inuention. 2. That Obiection confu|ted,
by the Antiquity. 3. Vniuersality. 4. Consent. 5. Perpetuity of Re|ligion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_AS there is nothing in the world, wherein all the whole world
doth so generally consent, as they doe in beleeuing that
<HI>There is a God:</HI> so is there nothing againe, wherein they doe se|condarily
so generally consent, as they doe in the acknowledge|ment
of that generall Consent. All men doe beleeue, that <HI>There
is a God,</HI> and all men doe beleeue, that all men do beleeue, that <HI>There is a God.</HI>
As the beleefe it selfe is generall: so is the beleefe of the beleefe generall: the
<HI>Atheist</HI> only exempted: who, as he is an Aduersary vnto God himselfe, so is he
likewise an Aduersarie vnto this consent. And, as he denieth the one: so doth
he likewise denie the other of them: knowing, that if this consent be granted,
<PB N="59" REF="48">
it will from thence follow, that there needes must be a God: as you shall see
hereafter proued in the last Chapter of this Booke. And therefore, hee figh|teth
against this consent, with no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> indeauour, then hee doth against God:
seeking to expugne the veritie of the one, by oppugning the Vniuersalitie of
the other. And so, he chardgeth vpon this consent, with three seuerall Ob|iections;
as it were, with three Bands.</P>
<P>The first of his three Obiections against it, is a simple and categoricall deny|ing
of it: that there is not among men any such generall consent, as is gene|rally
imagined, and commonly praetended: vnto which, in the former Chap|ter,
I haue answered.</P>
<P>The second (vnto which I am now to answere) is this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Atheist's second Ob|iection. That Religion is but an humaine inuention.</NOTE> That, though there
were such a generall consent, as is conceiued; yet, that this is not a naturall,
but an artificiall consent: not begotten in mens harts, by a naturall instinct,
but implanted in them, by the cunning of euill arte. For that, all diuine reli|gion,
is indeed nothing else, but an humaine inuention; artificially excogita|ted,
to keepe men in awe: that they, who will not liue vertuously, for the loue
of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">stice; yet might shunne to liue wickedly, for the feare of vengeance. This
doth the <HI>Atheist</HI> make to be the true foundation of all Religion: reducing it
so, from a diuine infusion, to be in truth no better, then an humane
illusion.</P>
<P>And indeed this is a very sore Obiection, striking at the roote and the
heart of all Religion. Which, though it be in truth but a mere idle fiction,
conceiued without all ground of truth or reason; yet hath it obtayned a farre
greater credit, with many learned men, then ought to bee affoorded to so
vaine a suspition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 1. de. Pla|cit. Cap. 7. To. 2. Mor. p. 14.</NOTE> Wherein, the cheifest Ring-leaders are these three: <HI>Euripi|des,</HI>
the Poet; <HI>Tullie,</HI> the Orator; and <HI>Seneca,</HI> the <HI>Philosopher. Euripedes,</HI> a se|cret
and concealed <HI>Atheist,</HI> not daring directly to vent out his <HI>Atheisme,</HI> for
feare of the law, deuised an artificiall meane, how to broache that impietie
in another mans person, which he durst not in his owne. And so he suborned,
in his <HI>Tragoedie,</HI> the person of <HI>Sisyphus,</HI> to expresse all his vngodlinesse, and to
teach it from the Stage: telling by him a long and a formall Tale; <HI>How the
life of men in old time, was like the life of beasts: the stronger, by violence,
oppressing the weaker; vntil, at last, men were forced to deuise seuere lawes, for
the repressing of such iniustice. But when they found (vpon some triall) that all
those lawes could do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> small good; because they could only take hold vpon such,
as were open and publique offences, and not vpon close and secret ones; there
step't vp among them a subtile politique man, who taught them a meane to
prouide for that mischeife too: and to praeuent close offences, as well as open,
ones. And that (saith he) is this; If they will but teach the people, and beate in
to their heads:</HI>
<Q><L>Qu&ograve;d sit perenni vita aliquis vigens <HI>Deus,</HI></L>
<L>Quicernat ista, et audiat, at&abque; intelligat.</L>
<L>An Euerliuing One, there is, whom God we call,</L>
<L>And he both hear's, and see's, and vnderstandeth all.</L></Q>
This Tale tells <HI>Euripides,</HI> by the mouth of <HI>Sisyphus: Veritati tenebras menda|cio
offundens,</HI> seeking to obscure the truth with the darkenes of his lie (as <HI>Plu|tarch</HI>
very truly censureth his bad artifice) seeking so to teach the people that

impietie from the Stage, which he durst not from the Pulpit: and that by a

<HI>Atheists</HI> (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> instanceth againe in the person of <HI>Herodotus</HI>)
who secretly intending to blaspheme the gods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutar. lib. De Herodoto To. 3. Mor. p. 630.</NOTE> he expresseth his owne impie|tie
in the person of <HI>Solon; Dijs maledicens sub persona Solonis: Rayling vpon

But, in this kinde hath <HI>Tullie</HI> playd his parte, most artificially. For hee,
(fearing the rigour of the Lawes among the <HI>Romanes,</HI> as <HI>Euripides</HI> did before
among the <HI>Athenians</HI>) hath imitated his policie, in expressing his impietie:
and suborned <HI>Cotta,</HI> as an <HI>Academike,</HI> to dispute against God: who, by the li|bertie
of that licentious profession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. De Diui|nat. p. 285.</NOTE> might more safely doe it. For, the sect
of the <HI>Academikes</HI> would determine nothing: but yet did professe, that they
would freely dispute, both for, and against euerie thing. And so, by that occa|sion,
he divulged that impietie, in the person of <HI>Cotta,</HI> which he durst not
haue done, in the person of <HI>Cicero:</HI> as euen he himselfe, in a manner, confesseth.
For, being demanded, <HI>An sint Dij?</HI> he answereth, that it is, <HI>Difficile negare,
si in concione queratur;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. De Nat. Deor. p. 192.</NOTE> <HI>sed in privato sermone et confessu, facillimum. If the
Question</HI> (saith he) <HI>be moued, Whether there be a God? it would be dangerous
to denie it, in the praesence of the multitude: but yet, safe ynough, among the
wise and learned.</HI> Whereby he insinuateth, that the most part of the learned
did propende to that opinion; though, for feare of the multitude, they durst
not publish their irreligion. And therefore, by the forenamed <HI>Cotta,</HI> he insinu|ateth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. De Nat. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or. p. 200.</NOTE>
that there were not a few; <HI>Qut dixerunt, totam de Dijs immortalibus

<P>2 Now, that it is but a meere fiction [<HI>That Religion should be a fiction</HI>]
<PB N="61" REF="49">
hauing neither any substance, nor good colour of Reason; it appeareth
by many Reasons: as namely, by these foure, among diuers other, to wit,
<HI>the Antiquitie, Vniuersalitie, Consent,</HI> and <HI>Perpetuitie</HI> of <HI>Religion.</HI> All
which are Arguments of the <HI>Veritie</HI> of it: and that it is not a fiction
deuised.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Antiquity of Religion. Cap. 5. Sect. 1.</NOTE> for the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of it: that may be considered two seuerall wayes:
either particularly, as it is in euery seuerall man: or generally, as it is in the ge|neration
of al men. Both which two Antiquities, do notably confute the fable
of <HI>Euripides.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 3. Sect. 1. &amp; 2.</NOTE> For the first of those <HI>Antiquities,</HI> I haue shewed you <HI>before,</HI>
that there is no notion so ancient in the mind of a man, as is the notion of
Religion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arnob. l. 1. Cont. Gent. p. 476.</NOTE> Which <HI>Arbobius</HI> affirmeth to be begotten in vs, euen whilst we
are in the wombe of our mothers, <HI>ipsis pen&egrave; in genitalibus Matris.</HI> Where,
I am sure, we could heare no such politique old Tales, as <HI>Euripides</HI> affirmeth
to be the first be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">tters of <HI>Religion</HI> in vs. Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iamblic. l. de Myster. c. 1. p. 5. <HI>Cap. 3. Sect.</HI> 2.</NOTE> and <HI>Iamblicus,</HI> an Heathen,
affirmeth of <HI>Religion;</HI> that it is implanted into the minde of a man, <HI>Et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">am
ante omnem rationis vsum: Euen before hee haue any vse of reason:</HI> as <HI>before</HI>
I noted of him. Which, if it be true, then could not Religion be a politique
inuention, to beguile the simpler sort of men. For, how could it then be im|printed
into Children? yea, and that before they haue the vse of reason?
When as <HI>Aristotle</HI> affirmeth of politique doctrine, that it is too high for the
reach of any young men:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. Ethic. c. 3. To. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 605.</NOTE> then much more of young Children. For, if
<HI>Iuuenis</HI> be not <HI>idoneus auditor ciuilis Disciplinae;</HI> then much lesse is <HI>Infants.</HI>
And therefore it hath not any colour of reason, that <HI>Religion</HI> (being so time|ly
begotten in them) should be first implanted by the meanes of such a fabu|lous
instruction. There is (I say) no colour of reason in this reasonlesse
fiction.</P>
<P>Now for the generall Antiquity of Religion, and that ancient possession,
which it hath had in the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. Stoic. To. 3. p. 564.</NOTE> <HI>Plutarch</HI> sayth, <HI>that it is so ancient, that no
man can tell the first originall of it.</HI> And hee applieth to this purpose those
verses of <HI>Sophocles:</HI>
<Q><L>Non nunc enim, ne&abque; heri sunt ista prodita:</L>
<L>Semper valu&ecirc;re, nec quando inierint, liquet.</L>
<L>These things were not of yesterday or lately brought to passe:</L>
<L>They euer were, and no man knowes when their beginning was.</L></Q>
But, for the true Antiquity of it, let vs but follow the stepps of it, as they be
expressed to vs in the word of God, and we shall finde, that Religion is more
ancient, then any fiction; and the practise of piety, then any deuised lye. For,
when there were but three men in the vniuersall world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 4. 3. 4.</NOTE> we reade, that two of
them offered vp their sacrifices vnto God: when as yet there was neither
cause of the making of lawes against publique oppressions, nor, of diuising
such fables against secret offences. And therefore, Religion could not grow
from either of those causes. Nay, it appeareth euen in their examples, that
oppression (though <HI>per accidens</HI>) grew rather from religion, then religion
from oppression. For, before those two Brothers had offered vp their sacri|fices,
there was no oppression: but when they were once dispatched, it pre|sently
followed; the one brother violently oppressing the other; yea and that
meerely vpon this one emulation, because he was better accepted in his re|ligion.
<PB N="62" REF="50">
Whereby it appeareth, that religion is almost as ancient as man;
nay, altogether as ancient. For the very first man is sayd to be <HI>cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ted in

So that Time, which prescribeth against all humane inuentions, and which

the west <HI>Indians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fet. Mart. Decad. 1. l. 5. p. 30. b.</NOTE> which neither cloathe their bodies, nor couer their shames;
and yet can meete with none, but that they haue their gods. Which sense
of Religion, could not possibly be implanted into euery Nation, either
by imitation from their neighbours; because some be so wilde and sauage,
that they do not admit of any entercouse or commerce: Nor yet by institu|tion
among themselues; vnlesse we should imagine, that in euery Nation,
there should sodainely steppe vp such a politique wise man; and (as it were
by fate) tell the same Tale of Religion: or that <HI>Euripides</HI> his man had com|passed
the whole world about, like the Sunne, and read his prophane lecture
in euery Nation. Both which suppositions were idle and ridiculous. And
therefore it is apparent, that Religion cannot be of humane institution; but
that the same common Nature, which hath giuen vnto all men their hearts,
hath also giuen Religion into all their hearts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lactan. l. 3. c. 10. p. 143. Item l. 2. c. 3. p. 75.</NOTE> to be among them, as common,
as their naturall forme. For so indeed doth <HI>Lactantius</HI> esteeme it. He ac|compteth
Religion, to be the most proper and essentiall difference, betweene
a man and a beast; more, then either <HI>Risus,</HI> or <HI>Ratio,</HI> or <HI>Oratio;</HI> then either
<HI>Laughing,</HI> or <HI>Speaking,</HI> yea, or <HI>Reason</HI> it selfe. All which he there proueth to
be (in some degree) communicated vnto Beasts; but Religion to bee proper
and peculiar vnto Men: and yet common vnto all men. But, that, neither
by domesticall instruction at home; nor yet, by mutuation, or imitation a|broad:
but only, by that naturall instinct and disposition, which God hath
ingrafted, into the hearts of all men: as <HI>Alexander ab Alexandro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alex. ab Alex. l. 6. Genial. Dier. c. 26. p. 384. b.</NOTE> hath very
truly obserued: <HI>Primi mortales, nulla doctrinae schola, Ratione, aut Lege; sed
suo quis&abque; ingenio, numina coluerunt. The first men, were neither taught by any
learning, nor perswaded by any reason, nor compelled by any law; but onely, of
their proper and naturall inclination, betooke themselues vnto the worshipping
of gods.</HI> Yea, and that so generally, throughout the whole world; that there
is not any nation vnder heauen excepted. Which vniuersality of religion, de|clareth
that it is not an humane inuention, but a diuine impression; yea, and a
Diuinity-lesson, of Gods own heauenly teaching. As we may see by his schoo|ling
of the first man <HI>Adam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 3.</NOTE> whom he catechised vnto the obedience of God,
both by giuing him a commandement, and by annexing to it a punishment.</P>
<P>4. And the same may likewise bee proued by that vniform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> consent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vniforme Consent in Religion.</NOTE>
which is among all men, as concerning Religion, of whatsoeuer degree or
condition. Which in this one thing is farre greater, then it is in any other of
what nature soeuer: as I haue shewed <HI>before.</HI> We see by experience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 5.</NOTE> that
not only diuers Nations haue diuers fashions, and diuers conceits, and opi|nions
<PB N="64" REF="51">
in most things; but that, euen in the same Nation, that diuers Cities
haue diuers guises, behauiours, habits, speeches, and manners: as our Coun|try-man
Sir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. 10. Mandeuile part 2. c. 24. Eng. V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">yag. p. 45.</NOTE> <HI>Iohn Mandeuile</HI> well obserued, in his trauell. And yet, in belee|uing
that <HI>There is a God,</HI> there is no difference at all, throughout the whole
world: no City iarres with Citie, no Country with Country: but among
them all an vniuersal agreement: wherein, both the learned and vnlearned
do consent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. l. de Prae|scrip. c. 28. p. 209.</NOTE> From which head, <HI>Tertullian</HI> concludeth the verity of <HI>Religion.</HI>
For, <HI>Quod apad multos vnum invenitur, non est erratum, sed traditum. The
consent of all men, as concerning God, doth shew it to be no erring humane in|uention;
but a most certaine diuine tradition.</HI> For, if Religion were no bet|ter,
but a politique deuice and inuention of man, it was a very marueilous fe|licity
in lying, that he had, which first deuised the tale of Religion: that he
should tell his fable in such a fortunate howre, as to beguile the whole world
with it, and that for euer after. This was a cunning Iuggler indeed, that could
cast so cunning a <HI>glaucoma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plaut. Mil. Glor. Act. 2. Sce. 1. p. 467.</NOTE> and such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> mist before the eyes of the wisest;

facile deluderent? What a strange kind of efficacy had that man in his lying,
that could bewitch with one Tale, not only the vnlearned; but also Plato, and So|crates,
and Pythagoas, and Zeno, yea, and Aristotle himselfe, the principallest
Masters of all the learned Sects?</HI> This lie was begotten in a strange constel|lation,
if it were a lie, that one wise man should make fooles of all the wise
men of the world: and yet, by all their wisedome, neuer be descried. There|fore,
we may conclude with <HI>Seneca,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. l. 4. de Benefic. c. 4. p. 49.</NOTE> that if <HI>Religion</HI> were a <HI>siction; Non in
hunc furorem omnes mortales consensissent, alloquendi surda numina, &amp; in|efficaces
Deos: Surely, all the whole world would neuer haue conspired in this
madnes, to call vpon such deafe and idle gods.</HI></P>
<P>Beside, as <HI>Lactantius</HI> truely noteth in the very same place, (where he doth,
<HI>ex professo,</HI> dispute this very case) <HI>He could not be a wiseman, that was the Au|thor
of this so false a fiction.</HI> For the end of true wisedome is to draw men
out of error, and not to leade them into it, as this false impostor did. And
therefore he concludeth from this so generall a consent in Religion, that it
could not be possibly an humane inuention.</P>
<P>5 And yet the same may be further declared by the perpetuall succession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Perpetui|ty of Religion.</NOTE>
and propagation of Religion: which hath thriuen, from the beginning,
with such admirable prosperity, that it hath not decayed in any Country, or
City: but, wheresoeuer it hath bene planted, there hath it euer florished, and
could neuer be supplanted. Which sheweth it to be a Plant, both by God
himselfe first planted, and graciously euer since, with the dew of his blessing,
watered.</P>
<P>For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 15. 13.</NOTE> as <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe teacheth vs, <HI>Euery plant, which the heauenly Father hath
not planted shall be rooted out.</HI> And therefore, if Religion had beene but a
plant of mans planting and setting, it would long since haue beene blasted,
yea, and vtterly starued. For, no humane inuention, had euer, either such a
prosperous increasing; and such a long, &amp; a firme continuing in the world, as
<PB N="65" REF="51">
Religion hath had: but all the conceits of men, though for a time they may
shoot-out, and haue a kinde of flourishing; yet doe they quickly decay againe;
time blasting and withering them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 129. 6. Cic. l. 2. Offic. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">69.</NOTE> <HI>as the grasse which growes vpon the topps of
houses.</HI> For, as the Orator hath very truely noted: <HI>Ficta omnia, celeriter, tan|quam
flosculi, decidunt: All fayned deuises, come quickly to an ende, as flowers
shattered by the wynde.</HI> And againe in another place vnto the same purpose:
<HI>Opinionum commenta delet dies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. De Nat. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or. p. 201.</NOTE> <HI>Naturae iudicia confirmat: Time destroyeth
all those fancies, which haue none other ground, but only humane opinion; but,
it strengtheneth all those iudgements, which are founded vpon truth, and sound
naturall reason.</HI> As for example. The particular conceite of all the heathen
gods, hath time now deuoured; because that was nothing else, but <HI>opinionis
commmentum:</HI> But, the generall beleefe, that <HI>There is a God,</HI> it hath in all
places confirmed; because this beleefe is <HI>Naturae iudicium.</HI> And therefore
Religion, which thus growes stronger and stronger by time, and hath conti|nued
so firmely, from the very beginning, without any decaying, must
needes haue a better ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. Epis. 121 p. 307.</NOTE> then a meere humane opinion. For, as <HI>Seneca</HI>
hath well obserued; <HI>Falsa non durant: False things continue not.</HI> And there|fore
this thriuing of religion, and this perpetuall succession of it, haue euen
the Heathen collected, to be a true argument, of the infallible truth of it:
and that it is vnpossible, that it should be no better then a fiction deuised:
<HI>Qu&ograve;d,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. de Nat. Deor. p. 227.</NOTE> <HI>et omnium esset, et quotidi&egrave; cresceret: because it was both so generally
receiued, and beleeued of all men, and so prosperously continued from the very
beginning:</HI> concluding no lesse, from the Perpetuitie of it, then from the
Vniuersalitie; that it is a plant of natures owne breeding: and therefore can|not
be any politique inuention. And consequently, that <HI>Euripides,</HI> in his for|ged
inuention, <HI>That Religion should be nothing but an humane inuention,</HI> did
(as <HI>Plutarch</HI> truly censures him) <HI>mendacio veritati tenebras offundere:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 2. de Pla|cit. c. 7. To. 2. Mor. p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Hee
sought onely, to obscure the truth, with a lie.</HI> And therefore, for this his pro|phanesse,
in this his deuice against religion and piety, he better deserueth that
inured note of <HI>Tullie [Capitalis Euripides</HI>] then for his iniustice against
right and equitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. offic. p. 387.</NOTE> in that his other sentence:
<Q><L>Nam si violandum est ius, regna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">di gratia</L>
<L>Violandum est; alijs rebus, pietatem colas.</L>
<L>If Iustice may be wrong'd at all, then for a Crowne it may:</L>
<L>Except a Kingdom's case, in all, let Pietie thee sway.</L></Q>
Here yet was, in some things a conseruation of equitie: but his Tale against
Religion imported in all things, an extirpation of pietie: as the Orator obser|ueth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. deor. p. 200.</NOTE>
and that very truly: <HI>Qut dixerunt totam de Dijs immortalibus opinionem

all opinion of the gods to be but a fiction, doe vtterly take away the summe of
Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Now these things considered, it euidently appeareth, that it is not Religi|on,
that is a fraudulent inuention, to beguile and deceiue men: but rather
this slander of Religion, <HI>that it should be but a fraudulent inuention,</HI> this is a
fraudulent inuention indeed: yea, and that a very wicked one: as euen <HI>Tullie</HI>
himselfe insinuateth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de. diuin. p. 241.</NOTE> nay plainely expresseth, when hee saith of their Reli|gions;

rather meane, then this, of their affirming, that religion is nothing else but
an humane inuention: which is indeed a very fraudulent suggestion, and
a fable artificially inuented, and composed against religion: But, so is not

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THere is yet a third Obiection behind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Atheists third Obiecti|on: oppugning the vniuersali|tie of consent in Religion, by their owne dissenting.</NOTE> which may be made by
the <HI>Atheist,</HI> against the <HI>Supposition</HI> of this so vniuersall a consent
in Religion: and that is this following: That though it could
not be denyed, that both all Nations, and all professions of men
in the world, doe beleeue <HI>There is a God:</HI> yet that it cannot be
affirmed, that all seuerall persons haue also therein consented. Because,
there be recorded, in the writings both of <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> the very
names of diuers men, that haue directly denied it; yea, and openly defended,
<HI>That there is no God.</HI> Amongst whom, though they haue beene branded with
the name of <HI>Atheists,</HI> as with a note of infamie, as crossing the current of
that generall opinion with among other men was receiued, &amp; beleeued most
confidently; yet were they not denied to haue bin both wise and learned; as
ranked, euen by their aduersaries, amongst the number of <HI>Philosophers.</HI> And
therefore, their opinion cannot (in common reason) but haue farre
greater weight, then the whole multitude of the vnlearned: because (as
<HI>Lactantius</HI> very truly obserueth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lactan. l. 2. c. 19. p. 124.</NOTE> <HI>Plus est momenti in paucioribus doctis, qu&agrave;m
in pluribus imperitis: There is a great deale more weight, in a few, that are
learned; then in a many, that are ignorant.</HI> So that, a multitude of the vulgar,
are not able to counterpoise so much as one <HI>Philosopher:</HI> their iudgement
being branded with that note of infamie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Di|uinat. p. 274.</NOTE> that <HI>Nihil est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, qu&agrave;m nihil
sapere, vulgare: That there is nothing so common, as for the common people to
vnderstand nothing.</HI> And therefore, notwithstanding all the crye of the vulgar
(who obtaine their opinions, not by reason, but by clamor) that may fall out
in this case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 8. ad A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ic. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> p. 3. p. 309.</NOTE> which is noted by the Orator: <HI>vt altera res verbosior sit,
altera verior. That the one part may bee the truer, though the other bee the
lowder.</HI></P>
<P>2 But now vnto this Obiection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of <HI>Atheists</HI> very small.</NOTE> I answer three things. First, that for their
number, the <HI>Atheists</HI> doe well not to stand vpon that plea; but to disclaime it
vtterly, and not to vie with their Aduersaries in that point, for the victorie.
<PB N="67" REF="52">
For the number of those that haue denied God, is so little, in comparison of
those that confesse him, that (to vse the Orators comparison) it is but <HI>stilla
muriae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. De fin. p. 73.</NOTE> <HI>ad mare Aegeum: but as one</HI> drop <HI>of brine vnto a whole Ocean.</HI> Their
multitude is so great, and so infinite aboue their opposite. Neither these one|ly,
a multitude of the ignorant and vnlearned, but also euen of the wise and
learned. All the learnedest Philosophers, and all the wisest Sages, that euer
were in the world, may be numbred in this multitude, that confesse <HI>there is a
God.</HI> So that if any cause can gaine any estimation, either by the number, or
honour of those that defend it; or by the fewnesse, and basenesse, of those that
oppugne it; no cause hath more aduantage, in both these points, then this.</P>
<P>For first, as concerning the number of those <HI>Atheists,</HI> it is so poore and
contemptible, that it is an infinite disgrace, and reproach vnto their cause, to
haue beene, in all mens eyes, so abiect, and profligated, as to be able to get no
moe defenders, since the world was first created: especially, being taught by
such learned <HI>Philosophers,</HI> as they would insinuate. This is a foule disgrace vnto
their cause, that so great learned Teachers, could get so few Disciples; especially
being followed by so many Auditors: as <HI>Laertius</HI> obserueth in <HI>Bion</HI> of <HI>Boris|thenis,</HI>
one of the chiefest <HI>Atheists,</HI> that; <HI>Nemo illius Discipulus inscribitur, c&ugrave;m
tot habuerit auditores.</HI> So that, in all ages, there haue beene but very few, either
<HI>Masters</HI> or <HI>Schollers</HI> in the doctrine of <HI>Atheists.</HI> And this <HI>Tullie</HI> obiecteth vn|to
<HI>Epicurus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de fin. p. 58.</NOTE> another of their principallest <HI>Atheists. In vestris disputationibus,

<P>And indeed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Chap. Sect 4. <HI>in fin.</HI></NOTE> if we speake of <HI>Atheists</HI> strictly, and properly, for such as haue
simply denied all diuinity, and denied it constantly; <HI>Tullies</HI> sentence is most
true, that there neuer was any such creature in the world (nay neuer any such
Monster) as simply and constantly to deny God. The name of an <HI>Atheist</HI> in
this sense, is but, <HI>Nomen ociosum; A name without a thing.</HI></P>
<P>If we speake of <HI>Atheists</HI> in a larger sense, for such as haue openly (though
not constantly) denied the <HI>Diuinity; Maximus</HI> his sentence is true, that, of
such professed <HI>Atheists,</HI> there haue not beene past two or three. Nay, if wee
speake of <HI>Atheists,</HI> in the largest and most extended sense, for such as haue ei|ther
not denied Gods essence, but onely certaine of his properties, as his pro|uidence,
his iustice, his goodnesse, and such like: or, if they haue denied it, yet
haue done it but weakely, rather vpon some sudden passion, then any setled re|solution:
yet, euen so, their number hath scarcely amounted vnto a dozen, or
a score; I meane of such open <HI>Atheists,</HI> as haue made any publique profession
of their <HI>Atheisme,</HI> though but euen in these secondary points. As wee may
partly see in <HI>Aelian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian. l. 2. var. Hist. c. 31. p. 395.</NOTE> who hath made a lyst of them, and named all he knew:
and yet (God knowes) they are but very few. There be not aboue sixe of them:
who yet, all of them did not deny God himselfe; but some of them, his proui|dence,
and some other his praedictions; as appeareth by those <HI>Dogmata,</HI> which,
in that place, he recounteth. Now, if we should search into the monuments
of all Antiquity, both of <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins,</HI> we should scarcely be able to adde
halfe a dozen more, vnto those that are named by <HI>Aelian</HI> before. Whereby it
appeareth, that, for their number, they be miserable: God, in his mercifull pro|uidence,

<P>3 And, as their number was but little,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The learning of <HI>Atheists</HI> not very great.</NOTE> so their learning was not great.
They were of no great value, neither <HI>numero,</HI> nor <HI>pondere.</HI> The value of their

hath made them no lesse scorned then abhorred of all men, and iustly to in|curre
that note of derision, which the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> hath imprinted vpon
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 14. 1.</NOTE> that they iustly may be esteemed, to be rather <HI>Fooles,</HI> then wise men.

the true one. Which yet, gaue him iust occasion, to scorne and deride them, as

<P>Let vs therefore come from <HI>Diagoras,</HI> vnto <HI>Protagoras,</HI> whom the <HI>Athe|nians,</HI>
in like sort, condemned for an <HI>Atheist:</HI> yet not for denying God; but
for seeming to doubt of him: Because, in the beginning of his booke he pro|pounded

Adding there also this reason:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert. in vita Protagorae p. 320.</NOTE> <HI>Sunt enim plurima, quaeid scire prohibeant;

I cannot resolutely determine, neither whether they be, nor whether they be not;
Because there be many things, that let the knowledge of it; namely, both the vn|certainty

This report doth <HI>Laertius</HI> make of his doubting.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. Deor. p. 192.</NOTE> But, by <HI>Tully</HI> it is exprest,
a great deale more fauourably. But yet, by this his seeming doubtfulnes, the
<HI>Athenians</HI> were so incensed, that they mulcted him with exile, and decreed,
that his bookes should be publiquely burned. And yet, that <HI>Protagoras</HI> was
not a pure <HI>Atheist,</HI> we may probably gather, by two Arguments, out of that
description of his life, which is written by <HI>Laertius.</HI> The first of them, that
he maketh <HI>precationem</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign">],<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert. vbi supra p. 321.</NOTE> that is, Prayer, and Inuocation <HI>to be the first
fundamentall part of an Oration:</HI> which I haue <HI>formerly</HI> shewed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 1. Sect. 3.</NOTE> to haue
bene put in practice, by all the most renowned Orators. Therefore, he could
not thinke, that there was no God. For, he would neuer pray to nothing. If
he had bene perswaded, that the name of God, were but an idle name, and
that there were no <HI>thing,</HI> that were answerable to it, he would neuer bestow
his prayers vpon it.</P>
<P>Againe, among his workes, there was one of his Bookes inscribed, <HI>De ijs
que sunt apud inferos.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. page 322.</NOTE> Now, if he thought that there were <HI>Inferi,</HI> he must
needs thinke that there were <HI>Superi.</HI> For <HI>Infra,</HI> and <HI>Supra,</HI> haue so necessary
a relation, that the one of them can neither stand, nor yet be vnderstood
without the other. And therefore, in admitting of the one, he must needs
admit of both. As <HI>Socrates</HI> plainely proueth: If there be <HI>Damones,</HI> there must
needs be <HI>Deus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Apolo|gia. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">13.</NOTE> <HI>Eiusdem viri est, Daemonia simul, &amp; Diuina putare: It necessa|rily

nothing but what they haue seene; that, Deuills being shewed them by the power
of Art Magicke, they then presently beleeued, That there was a God.</HI> So that,
for any thing that hath hitherto bene sayd, <HI>Protagoras</HI> was no <HI>Atheist:</HI> he
was not a denier, but a doubter of the gods, at the most. Now, doubting
implieth not <HI>Atheisme.</HI> For, diuers of the Prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s themselues, haue some|times
doubted. <HI>Iob,</HI> in one place, doubteth of Gods al-seeing prouidence:

their weake faith in God (especially for the present) but it could not conclude
their denying of God. And, no more could it in him: especially his other
writings implying, that he beleeued him.</P>
<P>Let vs yet proceed further, and consider of <HI>Euemerus:</HI> who was con|demned
for an <HI>Atheist,</HI> no lesse then <HI>Diagoras:</HI> whose opinion <HI>Theodoret</HI>
affirmeth to haue bene <HI>prophanam indeitatem, a prophane denying of God:</HI>
coupling him with <HI>Diagoras,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theod. l. de Principijs, To. 2. p. 498.</NOTE> and <HI>Theodorus,</HI> the most infamed of the <HI>A|theists.</HI>
But yet it appeareth, that his crime was not a generall denying of all
Gods, but only a denying of the heathen gods: and an affirming of them,
to haue bene but men: as Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> noteth of him: affirming that he
had imprinted into <HI>Virgil</HI> the same opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. Epist. 44. To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 2. p. 154.</NOTE> by reading him. So then, <HI>Eue|merus</HI>
his <HI>Atheisme</HI> was no more but this, that he affirmed of <HI>Saturne, Iupi|ter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de Iside To. 2. p. 174.</NOTE>
<HI>Hercules,</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> rest (whom the Heathens adored, and worshipped for
their gods) that they were indeed no gods: but either mighty Kings, and Em|perours;
or great Captaines by Land; or great Admiralls by sea; or such
like great persons, in their times. And this (he sayth) he read with his owne
eyes, written in Golden letters, among the <HI>Pancheans,</HI> and <HI>Triphilians.</HI>
Whose report, though <HI>Plutarch</HI> there doth seeke to discredit; imagining
the name of <HI>Triphilians,</HI> to be but a trifling and an imaginary name, there
being no such <HI>Triphilians</HI> in the world; yet therein indeed he discrediteth
himselfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. l. 7. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">68.</NOTE> For, <HI>Strabo,</HI> both affirmeth that there was such a Nation, and de|scribeth

Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lactan. lib. de falsa relig cap. 11. p.</NOTE> and <HI>Lactantius</HI> giueth credit to the relation of <HI>Euemerus:</HI> and affirmeth,
that <HI>Enntus</HI> followed his authority, in his History. So that from hence there
lyeth no exception, no not against his relation; much lesse against his opinion.
Which was indeed a most true one. For, if that opinion were <HI>Atheisme,</HI> then

hold the same opinion. And, though they durst not openly publish it; yet did
they certainly beleeue it; &amp; now &amp; then they would secretly confesse it, where

Therefore, to hold this, that the Heathen gods were men, was no prophane|nesse,
or impietie; but a solide veritie: which though it might not be pub|liquely
professed; yet was it priuately vnderstood, and beleeued. Whereby
it appeareth, that <HI>Euemerus</HI> his <HI>Atheisme,</HI> was not to Diuulge any vntruth
against the true God; but to diuulge a truth, against the false gods. And, the
rather may this be beleeued to be true; because <HI>Theophilus Antiochenus</HI> re|porteth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theophil. Anti|och. l. 3. ad Auto|lic. Bib. Pat. To. 5. p. 156.</NOTE>
that <HI>Euemerus</HI> did hold, not onely <HI>Animae immortalitatem,</HI> but also
<HI>Dei vnitatem: not onely the immortalitie of the soule, but the vnitie of the
Deitie.</HI> Neither of which points can congruously be held, by him, that hol|deth
There is no God. The word indeed which <HI>Theophilus</HI> there vseth, is
but, <HI>disputarit. But, that he disputed it;</HI> not <HI>problematice,</HI> but <HI>assertin&egrave;,</HI> conclu|ding
there was a God; it appeareth by this; because he saith, that therein he
was contrary vnto himselfe, in his former denying him. Which, though <HI>he</HI>
doe there impute vnto his inconstancie; yet may it bee probably thought, to
haue beene his <HI>palinodie:</HI> if he euer before had held, <HI>That there was no God.</HI>
For I will not peremptorily define, neither for him, nor for any of the rest,
that they were no <HI>Atheists;</HI> but only dispute the contrary, vpon probable
grounds: and that the accusations which haue beene layd against them, doe
not neccessarily conuince, that they were absolute <HI>Atheists;</HI> or that they ge|nerally
denied all gods, though they denied those, with whom they were
charged in their accusations. And this interpretation, I desire to be applied
both vnto all those <HI>Atheists,</HI> that haue gone before; and vnto all those, that
doe follow after. Let vs therefore now proceede.</P>
<P>For <HI>Theodorus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theop. Antioch. l. 3. ad Autolic. Bib. Pat. To. 5. p. 156.</NOTE> and <HI>Bion of Boristhens:</HI> though it should be granted (as
it is of them reported) <HI>That they generally denied, There was any God,</HI> yet
can it not be affirmed, that they <HI>constantly</HI> denied it. For, the one of them,
<HI>Theodorus,</HI> fell, in the end, into that madnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert. in vil. A|risstip. p. 77.</NOTE> as ridiculously to professe that

<P>Now if none of all those men, that haue beene most noted and renowned
for <HI>Atheisme,</HI> not onely by the writings of <HI>Pagans,</HI> but also of <HI>Christians,</HI> yet
were not truely <HI>Atheists</HI> indeed; but that, notwithstanding their derision
<PB N="106" REF="59">
of those false gods, they might well beleeue that there was a true one: then
can none of their examples (no nor all of them) serue to infringe the genera|lity
of our former position: that <HI>There is no man in the world, but that at some
time or other, in some degree or other, he beleeueth There is a God:</HI> no, not euen
the <HI>Atheists</HI> themselues excepted. Who (as you haue partly seene here, and
shall more fully <HI>hereafter</HI>) doe directly confesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 13. Why they were condemned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Atheists.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That there is a God.</HI></P>
<P>But here now, two Questions doe come to be discussed. First, that if these
men were no true <HI>Atheists</HI> indeed, why were they so condemned? and why
haue they beene infamed for such, if they were not such? Whereunto I briefly
answer: that this was onely through the iealousie and tendernesse of the Hea|thens,
in defending of their Countrey-gods: ouer whom they were so tender,
that whosoeuer denied <HI>them,</HI> they held that he held none: and though hee
professed that he beleeued others; yet they held, that he reiected all, if hee re|ceiued
not theirs. And this we may plainely see, in the iudgement of <HI>Socra|tes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xenophen l. 1. de factis Socrat. p. 157.</NOTE>
in whose very accusation, they layd to his charge, that he did, <HI>Priscos De|os
non colere, &amp; novos introducere: That he denied their old gods, and brought
them in new.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Item Plato in A|pologia p. 471. Idem in Euthyphrone p. 54. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ato ibid. p. 473</NOTE> Where, though they confesse, that hee beleeued certaine new
gods; yet they condemned him, as an <HI>Atheist,</HI> for reiecting of the olde: as
though that had beene to reiect all. And though <HI>Socrates</HI> iustly taxeth th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m,
as cleane contrary to themselues, in the two maine heads of their accusation;
to charge him with <HI>Atheisme,</HI> that is, a denying of all gods, in the one head;
whom they discharge in the other, by obiecting his new gods: deriding this
foolish intoxication, to be (in effect) as if they should haue said: <HI>Contra leges
agit Socrates, Deos non putans, sed Deos putans;</HI> yet their zeale in their religion
preuailed so farre, as to worke his condemnation: accounting it not much
lesse impiety, to assert any new gods, then to deny all gods. As wee may see
also by their catching at the speech of S. <HI>Paule:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Hee seemeth to be a setter-out
of strange Gods.</HI> And it is like enough, that if hee had stayed there, it might
haue cost him his head. For, though his new God were, in truth, the true
God; yet, because he disliked their old gods, they would haue held him for an
<HI>Atheist:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Athenag. Orat. pro. Christian. a|pud Iust. Mart. To. 1. p. 234.</NOTE> as they did (for the same cause) the whole sect of <HI>Christians:</HI> as <HI>Athe|nagoras</HI>
reporteth. <HI>Illi nobis Atheismum impingunt, propterea quod non eos|dem,
quos ipsi n&ocirc;runt, arbitremur esse [Deos:] They obiect euen to Christians,
the crime of Atheisme; because they do not worship the same gods with them.</HI> For,
this was their account, that he which reiected their gods, could not know a|ny
other; and therefore reiected them all together. And<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> it may be they erred
not, but that diuers of those <HI>Atheists,</HI> which reiected their gods, did it of a pro|phane
humour, not regarding any other: and therefore were iustly condem|ned
by them, of impiety and <HI>Atheisme.</HI> But if there were any such (as I will
not obstinately contend, but there might be some) yet this I hold of them, that
they did not constantly hold out their opinion: but that oftentimes they so
checked themselues, that they could not but inwardly beleeue there was a
God, though they outwardly denied it. Yea, and it may be likewise, that di|uers
of them, vpon vaine glory, or vpon studie of singularity, that they might
seeme to be wiser then other men, haue outwardly professed (though not in|wardly
beleeued) that <HI>There is no God.</HI></P>
<P>But then, here the second Question cometh to be resolued. To what end, this
<PB N="107" REF="59">
whole worke serueth, which is written against <HI>Atheists,</HI> if they be few, or
none such? Whereunto, though I haue partly answered in the preface to the
Reader; yet, I here will adde this further: That though there be but few such
<HI>Atheists</HI> (or rather indeed none) as resolutely and constantly beleeue with their
hearts, that <HI>There is no God;</HI> yea, and not many such, as professe it with their
mouthes, though not beleeuing it constantly: Yet be there very many, that
beleeue it weakely: and, that being ouercome by sodaine passions and temp|tations,
do oftentimes doubt, and distrust; whether there be any God?
As we see it ingeniously confessed, by <HI>Ouid.&mdash;Ignoscite fasso;</HI>

<L>Confesse I do, and pardon crauc;</L>

Yea, and the same is acknowledged by <HI>Claudian,</HI> a <HI>Christian.</HI>

And few men can escape the very same temptations. Therefore, of this sort
of <HI>Atheists,</HI> there is as great a plenty, as of the first sort, a scarcity. Nay, there
is almost no man, but at some time or other, he falleth within the compasse
of this doubting.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in Psal. 52. To. 8. p. 509.</NOTE> So that (as it is truly obserued by Saint <HI>Augustine) Hoc

with him this distinction: that I be not often driuen to make this repetition:
namely, that when we deny that there be any <HI>Atheists,</HI> as be properly so called,
which generally and constantly beleeue <HI>There is no God,</HI> and hold so vnto the
end: (Of which sort there can be none, though many haue beene so reputed

humana sentit, etiamsi non exprimit: There is no man, but in his soule he doth
inwardly feele, That there is a God; though hee do not outwardly confesse it.</HI>)
When we confesse, <HI>There be Atheists,</HI> and dispute against them; wee vnder|stand
onely such as deny there is a God, rather by outward profession, then
by inward perswasion: or, if they haue indeed any such inward perswasion, it
is but onely vpon some sodaine passion: which vanisheth as sodainely, as it
was conceiued fondly. And of these sodaine and passionate eruptions,
may that place of the Psalmist bee vnderstood:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 14. 1.</NOTE> <HI>The Foole hath sayd in his

<P><PB N="108" REF="60">
5 And such were indeed all those renowned <HI>Atheists,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Atheists hold but weakely their opinion of Atheisme.</NOTE> whom we finde to be
most celebrated, in the monuments &amp; writings, not only of heathens, but also
of <HI>Christians.</HI> There was not one of al them, that could constantly hold out, &amp;

so weakely, and left the beleefe of it so easily, that it could not, in common
reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert. in vit. Bionis p. 145.</NOTE> be accompted their opinion: as <HI>Laertius</HI> inferreth vpon the recantation

of a lying countenance: such,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euripid. In Ione p. 819.</NOTE> as in a like case is described by <HI>Euripides.</HI></P>

<L>For who can pleasant be, and blest, that liues in feare and dread:</L>

<P>And yet, such is the state of the <HI>Atheist,</HI> euen when he seemeth the pleasan|test.
He still feareth that Gods vengeance will ouertake his pleasa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">: there|by

the name of God: but he granteth the thing; as hee sheweth by his fearing.
So that his heart neuer thinks that which his tongue speaketh. For, when his
tongue saith outwardly, that, <HI>There is no God:</HI> his heart saith inwardly, that,
<HI>There is a God:</HI> and so his heart telleth his tongue, that it lyeth. And when
he seekes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persius Satyr. 5. p. 11.</NOTE> by Reason, to proue <HI>there is no God:</HI>

and without all assurance. And therefore, euen the very <HI>Atheist</HI> him|selfe,

<P>The two Endes of Atheisme; Not to serue, and, Not to feare. 2. The Atheist

Belly. 5. All which seruice he referring to himselfe, he becommeth thereby,
A God vnto himselfe.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I Haue shewed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Ends of Atheisme.</NOTE> in the former chapter, that the <HI>Atheist</HI> doth but
weakely beleeue, <HI>There is no God:</HI> if hee beleeue so at all. But
there by many strong Arguments, whereby it may bee proued,
that indeed, he doth strongly beleeue, <HI>There is a God:</HI> though he
outwardly dissemble it. He beleeueth it not, with such a beleefe
of faith, as is able to saue him: but yet with such a beleefe of knowledge, as is
able to condemne him. And this he plainely sheweth, not onely by his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eeds,
but also by his words. By his deeds, in an oblique and direct confession: by
his words, in a very direct and expresse one. His deeds, whereby he confesseth,
that <HI>There is a God,</HI> be two: the enormous excesse of his loue vnto himselfe:
and that inward griping feare, which he feeleth within himselfe. For I finde
it obserued among the learned, that the destinate ends, which the <HI>Atheist</HI> pro|poundeth
vnto himselfe, in the choyce of his impious and damnable opinion,
are principally these two: <HI>Non seruire,</HI> and, <HI>Non metuere: That hee may not
serue,</HI> and, <HI>That he may not feare.</HI> The first of which two Ends, is instanced
<PB N="113" REF="62">
by S. <HI>Augustine. Quidam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ra <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. c. 36. To. 1. p. 702.</NOTE> <HI>propterea putant, nihil colendum esse, ne seruiant.
Some men will needs beleeue, there is no God to be serued, because they would not
serue him.</HI> The second of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> l. de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. To. 1. Mor. p. 381.</NOTE> is instanced by <HI>Plutarch. Finis, non credendi
Deum esse, est, metu vacare: The end of mens not beleeuing a God, is, to be free
from feare.</HI> And for the attaining of these two ends [<HI>that hee may not serue,</HI>
and, <HI>that he may not feare]</HI> will the <HI>Atheists</HI> needes beleeue (euen beyond all
beleefe, <HI>fide sine fide) That there is no God.</HI> For, no man would euer ingage
himselfe in <HI>Atheisme</HI> (so odious and so detestable an opinion) but onely to free
himself from <HI>seruing,</HI> &amp; <HI>fearing.</HI> But indeed, he is greatly deceiued in the~ both;
&amp; vtterly frustrated of his hoped end. For, no man serueth more, no man fea|reth
so much. So that he manifestly proueth, by both these two means, that he
thinks <HI>There is a God;</HI> by which he seeks to proue, that he thinks there is none.
And so (as the Orator obserueth of <HI>Philo</HI> the <HI>Academick) In idipsum se induit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. l. 4. Acad. Quaest. p. 13.</NOTE>
<HI>quod timebat: He t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rusteth his head into the very same snarewhich before he fea|red.</HI>
So that he may truly say with <HI>Iob&punc;</HI> a farre more holy man; <HI>The thing that I
greatly feared is fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e vpon me: and that whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h I was afraid of, is come vnto me.</HI></P>
<P>2 For the first end of the <HI>Atheist,</HI> which is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3. 25. The Atheist serueth many maisters.</NOTE> <HI>Non seruire:</HI> there is nothing
more certaine, then that the <HI>Atheist</HI> entertaineth his impious opinion, especi|ally
for this end: that so he may attaine to be <HI>A free man;</HI> and not either to
serue, or to obserue any other man: no nor any God neither. As it euidently
appeareth in <HI>Pherecides Syrus;</HI> who shamed not to glory (but his glory was
his shame) <HI>That he had neuer serued any of the gods,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian. l. 4. var. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. c. 28. p. 428.</NOTE> <HI>all his life, and yet h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d al|wayes
led a very pleasant and merry life.</HI> So that, this was the end which hee
aymed at, in his impiety, that he might not liue seruilely; as he accounted that
he should, if he worshipped any God: reckoning <HI>Piety</HI> to be <HI>Seruility:</HI> which
is indeed, cleane contrary*.<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o parere li|bertas est. Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">. l.

<HI>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</HI> And their impious <HI>Li|berty,</HI>

to others liberty, they themselues are the seruants of corruption.</HI> And the
<HI>Holy Ghost</HI> addes a reason: For, of whom a may is ouercome, of the same is
he brought in bondage. They make themselues seruants, vnto all the corrupt
fancies of their owne addle heads; and to all the corrupt desires of their owne
idle bellies. For these two bee the <HI>Atheists</HI> chiefe and principall maisters:
whom they serue, with more base and abiect seruility, then euer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ny slaue ser|ued,
in the cruellest captiuity. And well may they be so. For, according to

All wicked men are slaues.</HI> They that will not serue God himselfe, who is their

and rule ouer them; their lust, and their pride, and their curious ambition. And
this (as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> teacheth) falleth out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1&punc; 24 25. 26. 27. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 29.</NOTE> by the hand of Gods most iust ven|geance,
that <HI>They who refuse to serue their Creator, should by him, be giuen ouer,
vnto their vile affections; yea, euen into a reprobate sense, to serue their owne
lusts, and vncleannesse, and all manner of vnrighteousnesse; fornication, wick|ednesse,
couetousnesse, maliciousnesse, enuy, debate, deceite;</HI> and a number of
such like, which, euen there, hee reckoneth vp. And therefore the <HI>Atheist</HI> is
very farre, from that supposed libertie, which (in choosing of his <HI>Atheisme</HI>) he
promised vnto himselfe: being thereby made a seruant, not onely of many
Maisters, but also of most base and vnworthy Maisters. <HI>Turpissimus seruus,
Dominorum turpiorum: a most base seruant, of more baser Masters.</HI></P>
<P>3 But yet more particularly of <HI>Vaine-glory,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Atheists base seruing of his owne Ambition. Cic. l. 1. Tus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 113.</NOTE> and of <HI>Luxury.</HI> These two,

we may see,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. in vita <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ionis. p. 142.</NOTE> for an instance, in <HI>Bion</HI> of <HI>Boristhenes.</HI> Who, seeing that by all
his Lectures of <HI>Atheisme,</HI> he could not gaine, so much as one Disciple to fol|low
him: that he might not seeme, so vtterly deserted and despised, he hired
a company of <HI>Saylers,</HI> to follow him vp and downe, in the habit of <HI>Scholers,</HI>
through the chiefe streets of the Towne, and with them hee went ietting to|wards
the Schooles, as if he had bin followed, with a great traine of Disciples.
Now, what a miserable seruant of Ambition was this man, that durst thus
impotently affect it, where hee might so easily be detected? And the same
seruile affectation of <HI>Vaine-glory</HI> and Ambition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lact. l. de Ira Dei. c. 9. p. 455.</NOTE> may likewise be obserued, in
all the rest of them. Insomuch, that <HI>Lactantius</HI> maketh their ambition, to be
<PB N="115" REF="63">
the very fountaine of their impiety, and <HI>Atheisme.</HI> And, he giueth there for
instance, <HI>Diagoras,</HI> and <HI>Theodorus,</HI> who, hauing not the wisedome, to giue ho|nour
to themselues, by any new inuention of their owne; they sought to
clime vnto it, by confuting the receiued opinions of others. And so chose,
for the subiect of their contradiction, that most ancient, and most generally
approued opinion, <HI>That there is a God.</HI> And this (for their glories sake) they
would needs confute. In the second of which two, that is, in <HI>Theodorus</HI>
(who, for his notable impietie, was called <HI>cognomento, Atheos</HI>) it is a thing
that is very worthy of obseruation; that, as by meere ambition, he was ledde
vnto his <HI>Atheisme:</HI> so by the same ambition, he was ledde to renounce the
same againe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t, in vita Ari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tip. p. 77.</NOTE> And that by this witty strategeme. The Philosopher <HI>Stilpo,</HI> on
a time, came vnto him: and, being willing to make a triall, whether he could
inwardly be perswaded (as hee outwardly pretended) That there was indeed
no God? he set vpon him, with this Question. <HI>Tell me (&ocirc; Theodorus) whe|ther
thou be such a one indeed, as thou art commonly esteemed?</HI> Hee, thinking
that he had meant; <HI>Whether he were indeed, a true Atheist, or no?</HI> answered
him; <HI>He was so:</HI> that hee was the very same, that the people esteemed him.
<HI>Why then</HI> (sayth <HI>Stilpo) thou art surely, no Atheist; but thou art, indeed a very
God:</HI> artificially insinuating, that so the people esteemed him. With which
idle conceite, <HI>Theodorus</HI> being tickled, and loath to repell so glorious an as|scription;
he thought it better to renounce his former opinion. And so, from
thence forward, he held, <HI>That there was no God; vnlesse that he himselfe were
(haply) a God.</HI> By which his ambition, hee cast himselfe into so great a scorne;
that he, which before was called in detestation, <HI>Theodorus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert. in vita Aristippi. p. 73.</NOTE> <HI>Theodorus the
Mock-God;</HI> was called afterward, in derision, <HI>Theodorus <GAP DESC="foreign">, Theodorus the
Mockt-God.</HI> Whereby it appeareth, that the <HI>Atheist</HI> is truly a very slaue of
<HI>Vaine-glory;</HI> seruing it more basely, then euer any seruant did the cruellest
Tyrant. For, Tyrants can compell their seruants, but vnto outward obser|uance:
but they cannot inforce them, vnto any inward opinion, as you see
<HI>Vaine-glory</HI> can. It can compell the <HI>Atheist,</HI> not onely to accept, but also to
reiect his <HI>Athe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sme.</HI> And therefore, the <HI>Atheist</HI> cannot be a free man. Hee
gayneth not his libertie, by all his impiety. But, though hee renounce Gods
religion; because he would not serue him: yet serueth hee much more basely,
vnto his owne <HI>Ambition.</HI> And in seruing of it, he serueth the Deuill himselfe:
because he will not serue God. For <HI>Ambitionis via, est Diaboli adoratio:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernard in Psal. 90. Serm. 6. p. 291.</NOTE> if we
may beleeue Saint <HI>Bernard: The way of ambition, is the Deuills adoration.</HI> So
that now, the <HI>Atheist</HI> hath not only a Master, but also a God to serue: though,
by the choise of his <HI>Atheisme,</HI> hee sought to exempt himselfe from both of
them. But in them both, hee is intangled. For that, being a base seruant, hee
must needes haue a Maister, and he must needes haue a God. And so, renoun|cing
the true one, hee hath light vpon another, that is more worthy of him.
A base God, and a base Maister, for a base seruant, and a base worshipper.</P>
<P>4 But, as yet we haue not seene all his basenesse, in his seruing. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Atheists base seruice of his Belly.</NOTE> beside
his owne ambition, hee serueth yet another Maister; yea, and with no lesse
deuotion. And that is, his idle Belly. For, the seruing of whose appetite, it is
incredible, what base and seruile paines hee doth take. He riseth vp early,

the other gods; and yet confesseth, that he sacrificed to his Belly, as his God:
which he calleth, <HI>Geniorum maximum: the greatest of the gods.</HI> And the Orator
exemplifieth the same, in <HI>Epicurus:</HI> who being once grown vnto that profane|nes
and impiety, that he did, but, <HI>Deos ioc andi causa, introducere: that he made
mention of the gods, only by way of sport:</HI> he was led from thence, into that wan|tonnesse
and luxurie, that he did, with <HI>Metrodorus, Omne bonum in visceribus

<P>Yea, and <HI>Aristophanes</HI> insinuateth the same thing vnto vs: when he maketh
<HI>Diagoras</HI> (a knowne Reuiler of all their other gods) yet to be a true worship|per
of the drunken God <HI>Bacchus.</HI>

<L>After the manner of Diagoras.</L></Q>
Thus the <HI>Atheist</HI> (as you see it directly proued) is neither without Maister,
nor a God: but is indeed, a base seruant, both of many Maisters, and of many
gods. For, though hee doe most impiously reriounce all others gods; yet
serueth he, most basely, these three <HI>Belly-gods; Bacchus, Ceres, Venus.</HI> All
whom, the Comicall Poet conioyneth in one sentence:
<Q><L>Sine Cerere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terent. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nuch. Act. 4. Sce. 5. p. 82. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> &amp; Libero, friget Venus.</L>

So that, though all other gods doe <HI>frigere,</HI> with the <HI>Atheist;</HI> yet those three
forenamed Belly-gods, doe <HI>incalescere plus satis:</HI> his seruice of the first two,
of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and <HI>Ceres,</HI> drawing in (of necessity) his seruice of the third; his
seruice of <HI>Venus:</HI> as you see it expressed in the former sentence. For (as

<P>Thus the <HI>Atheist,</HI> though he seek to make himselfe a free-man, by the choice
of his <HI>Atheisme:</HI> yet is he, in very deed, the greatest bond-man in the world;
seruing his owne most base and refuse parts, with all most denout and hum|ble
seruice; compelling the most excellent and imperiall parts of his soule,
to serue the most abiect and ministeriall parts of his body: and honouring
(in a sort) those parts, as his gods, which are scarcely worthy to bee his ser|uants.
Which is indeede, a true seruitude, yea, and a most base one
too.</P>
<P>5 But it may be here obiected, That in all this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Atheist is a base slaue vnto himselfe. <HI>Cic. Paradox. 5. p.</HI> 424.</NOTE> he serueth but himselfe,
and not any other thing. And therefore is truely and properly a freeman.
Because, <HI>Libertas, est facultas viuendi vt velis: Freedome, is nothing else, but
onely a faculty, to liue as we please.</HI> So the Orator defineth it. And so the Po|et
confirmeth it.

<L>Can any man be free, but he, that may liue as he list?</L>

But vnto this I answer, that it may fitly be added, which there followeth in

Nay, it is a false collection, not onely in the iudgement of those rigid Philo|sophers,
but also of all sober, and wisely-iudging Christians. For, first, he is not
a free-man, that doth <HI>scruire sibi;</HI> but rather he, that doth <HI>sibi imperare: He is
not a freeman that is a seruant to himselfe, but he that is a master ouer himselfe:</HI>
that doth, <HI>cupiditatibus suis imperare; that ruleth &amp; commandeth ouer his own

Where he confesseth directly, that he yeelded vnto th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m, as a slaue and a

Who can therefore denie, but that all light, all couetous, and all wicked

<P>Neither doth his willingnes to continue in this seruice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. Epist. 47 p. 73.</NOTE> proue him to bee
no seruant: but rather to be a more seruile seruant. For, <HI>Nulla turpior est

and forced to yeeld vnto it; and that the most Prince-like and Hegemonical
part of his foule, which ought to rule ouer all, is now it selfe become seruile,
and a slaue vnto all. So that, his willingnesse to serue such base things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 21. 5. 6.</NOTE>
is the great brand of his slauishnes: as it was among the <HI>Israelit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sh</HI> ser|uants;
wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n they were content to continue still in their Bondage. When
the Seruants Prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ssed, that they so loued their Maisters, that they de|sired
not to be free from their seruice; then the Maister was appointed, to
bore their eares through, with a Nawle: and so to marke them, for perpetu|all
seruants. So that the <HI>Atheists</HI> willingnes, is the very note of the extre|mitie
of his basenesse; and that hee is no better, then a <HI>perenni-seruus:</HI> as the

neuer so willingly) <HI>his seruants we be: Whether it be of sinne vnto death,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. 16.</NOTE> <HI>or
of obedience vnto righteousnesse.</HI></P>
<P>As for that Obiection, that the <HI>Atheist</HI> bestoweth all this seruice, vpon
none other thing, but onely vpon himselfe: I haue shewed, <HI>that</HI> to be other|wise.
But let it be granted, that the <HI>Atheist</HI> indeede, both intendeth, and
extendeth all his actions, counsels, and indeauours, but onely to himselfe;
making so his owne selfe, the very end of himselfe: Yet, euen from hence it
will follow, that this his excessiue loue of himselfe, in thus honouring and
seruing himselfe, aboue all things; and regarding nothing else, but only
himselfe, and for himselfe; doth make him become a very god vnto himselfe.
And so, euen this way too, he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> is not without his god. For it is a true rule,

God, that hath his Bellie for his god, or that hath the glory of the world, and the

louing and honoring himselfe most of all things, doth thereby make him|selfe
his own<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> God. For, the principalitie of our loue and our seruice, is so
peculiar vnto God, that hee which hath it not, is not to vs a God, although
he be the true God: and that he, which hath it, he is to vs a God, although
he be a false God. Why then, the <HI>Atheist,</HI> giuing the principalitie of his
loue and seruice, onely to himselfe, doth thereby become a God vnto him|selfe.
And therefore cannot be sayd, to be without a God. For, in making
himselfe an <HI>Idol-God,</HI> hee becommeth both an Idol-maker, and an Idol it
selfe, &amp; an Idol-worshipper: offending so, most grossely, in all the three seuerall
degrees of Idolatrie. So that, howsoeuer the <HI>Atheist</HI> denieth God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> words; yet,
euen by his selfe-loue, he confesseth him in deeds, which is a more real, and a

And therefore the <HI>Atheist,</HI> affirming in his deed, <HI>That there is a God;</HI> &amp; denying

kinde of seruitude. <HI>Omnis metus servitus est. All fearfulnes

<HI>that liueth in feare.</HI> Yea and a base slaue too. For (as the Orator obserueth)

And there is indeed no slauerie, which the soule doth naturally more
detest and abhorre, then it doth to liue in feare. Neither is there any libertie,
that it desireth more earnestly, then it doth, to be freed from fearefulnesse and
dread. Insomuch that <HI>Democritus</HI> esteemed it true Happines, for any man to

<P>And therefore, the <HI>Atheist</HI> indeauoureth by all meanes, to shake off this
yoake of fearing, as well as he doth the former yoake of seruing: hoping then,
to be indeede an absolute free-man. But this freedome from feare he can ne|uer
attaine, as long as he harboureth in his heart, any sense of Religion. Be|cause,
<HI>Religion</HI> it selfe is a kinde of <HI>feare. Religion is nothing else, but the feare
of some God:</HI> as the Creator himselfe hath expressely defi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed it. <HI>Religio est,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">. p. 98. &amp; 84.</NOTE>

Whereby it appeareth, that the feare of God, is as naturally ingrafted, into
the mindes of all men, as is the opinion of his being: this being a true conse|quent
vnto that, and following it as naturally, as the shaddow doth the body:
And that generally in all men, without exception.</P>
<P>But yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Atheist feareth God more then a|ny other man.</NOTE> most specially in the <HI>Atheist,</HI> aboue all other men. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aue, in|deed,
the <HI>true</HI> feare of God which begetteth Religion, a great deale lesse then
any other men: but, that seruile feare, which begetteth confusion, a great deale
more. It is not all their <HI>Atheisme,</HI> that can free them from his slauish feare:
but it begetteth it in them rather. There is no man that feareth God so
much, as they that would seeme to feare him least: no man so basely feareth
him, as those men that seeme the most to cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mne him. For, it is the worke
of Gods iustice, that they which refuse to feare him as his Sonnes, shall bee
compelled to feare him as his slaues. And so indeed they doe. For (as <HI>Eli|phas</HI>
teacheth in the booke of <HI>Iob) There is a continuall sound of feare, in his
eares&punc; and a contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters"> sword before his eyes:</HI> the feare of Gods wrath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 15&punc; 20. 21. 22.</NOTE> and the

as not to feare euen God himselfe: whereas indeed, they feare the shaking of
euery little leafe. For, God himselfe seemeth, euen in scorne and derision, to
sport himselfe, with the <HI>Atheists,</HI> his enemies; and with that panick feare,
which he hath cast vpon them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I wil also laugh at your cala|mity: I will mocke when your fear com|meth. Pro. 1. 26. Lucret. l. 5. p. 228.</NOTE> and appointed continually to infest, and to
chase them.

<L>It Princes Scepters, Crownes, all State of men,</L>

<P>For, as the Psalmist plainely teacheth, <HI>When the Kings of the earth, and Prin|ces

And this is also confessed by another Heathen Poet:

<L>God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Sat. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 68. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> which beholds it, he doth it deride,</L>
<L>Not onely so, but hateth it beside.</L></Q>
So that, God is not feared by any of his creatures, with greater terror &amp; hor|ror,
then he is by <HI>Atheists.</HI> For, it may truely and generally be affirmed of <HI>A|theists;</HI>
which <HI>Caecilius</HI> very falsly affirmeth of <HI>Christians;</HI> that, <HI>Deos, quos, ne|gant,
reformidant: That though in words they deny God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arnob. l. 8. Cont. Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p 752.</NOTE> <HI>yet in their hearts they
feare him:</HI> and consequently confesse him.</P>
<P>And this feare the <HI>Atheist</HI> bewrayeth, at three speciall times, more emi|nently
and euidently, then he doth at any other; as I haue obserued out of
learned Writers. Namely, first, when he sleepeth: secondly, when it thun|dreth:
and thirdly, when he dieth. At these three speciall times, when hee
hath not the command of himselfe, to vse that artificiall obluctation, and fa|cing
out of the matter, which he doth at other times; but that his soule ap|peareth
naked, in his true and simple forme, without any a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ting, or fained
palliation; then sheweth it most plainely that inward feare of God, which be|fore
it dissembled, and artificially veyled.</P>
<P>3 For the first of which three times: to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The feare of Atheists in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> dreames.</NOTE> the time of their sleeping:
it is most certaine, that no man can endure so great trouble in his waking,
though pressed with neuer so many outward euils; as the vngodly man en|dureth
in his sleeping, by those fearefull dreames and visions, which at that
time seaze vpon him, and make euen sleepe it selfe, with <HI>Euripides</HI> calleth,

<L>The sweet asswager of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll other greife:</L></Q>
yet to become vnto them, a grieuous terror and vexation. We may partly see
this in <HI>Iob:</HI> who complaineth in his Booke, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 7. 13. 14 15</NOTE> <HI>when he thought within him|selfe,
that his Couch should releeue him, and his bed bring comfort to him: that
then he was so feared with dreames, and astonished with visions, that his soule
desired rather to be strangled, then with so great anxieties to abide in his bones.</HI>
So that sleepe (euen to this good man) was but,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. l. 22 De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">i|u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t.

(as S. <HI>Augustine</HI> speaketh) because of those fearefull dreames, wherewith it
was disquieted. Then must it needes much more be so, for their punishment
and torment. It is surely true in them; which <HI>Plutarch</HI> hath obserued, that,
<HI>Somnus, corporis quide est requies, animo interim terrores obuersantur, somnia
&amp; tumultus. Their sleepe is indeede a kinde of rest,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de. virtut. &amp; vit. Tom. 1. Mor. p. 226.</NOTE> <HI>vnto their bodies; but, in the
meane time, they doe finde no rest in their soules, but terrors and dreames, and
perturbed cogitations.</HI> As wee may plainely see, in those dreames and visions,
that molested the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> in the time of their dreadfull darkenesse; with
which they were so troubled, that their <HI>very soules fainted:</HI> as it is reported,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wis. 17. 13 &amp;c.</NOTE>

Heauens, and such like diuine tokens, doe terrifie the mindes of men of euill con|science.</HI>
And this feare groweth vnto <HI>Atheists,</HI> from a double cause; which
<PB N="126" REF="69">
both of them are founded in their seruile feare of God. The first is the con|science
of their owne impietie and wickednesse: which they needed not to
feare, if they thought there were no God. The second is, the terror of those
nocturnall apparitions, that represent themselues vnto them in their dreames:
which they might easily contemne, for vaine and idle fancies; but that they
are printed deeper, then can be blotted out, with all their artificiall and forced
irrisions.</P>
<P>For the first of those two causes, that is, the conscience of their owne
wickednesse: though they can easily passe it ouer in the day time, when they
wake; yet returneth it vnto them in the night time, when they sleepe: and
then tormenteth and afflicteth them, with the feare of those punishments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. l. 1. De Repub. p. 532.</NOTE>
which they doubt may expect them after their deaths. As <HI>Plato</HI> truly noteth:
<HI>Qui multas habet, in vita, iniquitates, ex ipso somno (tanquam puer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">) fre|quenter
excitus, extimescit, &amp; in pessima speviuit. Those men, that are guilty
of many iniquities in their life, are often times (like fearefull Children)
wakened out of their sleepe, and leade their liues with very little comfort.</HI> And
therefore <HI>Tullie</HI> (by a kinde of morall exposition) interpreteth those <HI>Furies,</HI>
which are represented in <HI>Tragoedies,</HI> affrighting the mindes of impious and
vngodly persons, to be nothing else,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. 1. De Leg. p. 317.</NOTE> but the affrightments of their consci|ehces
which fall vpon them in their dreames. <HI>Impietatum nulla expiatio est
&mdash;. Sed impios agitant, insectantur&abque; Furiae; non ardentibus t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dis (sicut in
fabulis) sed angore Conscientiae, fraudis&abque; crucialu. There is no satisfaction,
no sacrifice for Atheisme. For the mindes of all Atheists, are tormented by
Furies; yet, not with burning Torches (as we see it, in Tragoedies) but with
the griefe and anguish of their owne guilty Consciences.</HI> Now, what reason can
be alledged, why they should be so perplexed and affrighted with their Con|sciences
(especially in their secret and hidden transgressions) but onely, that
they know, that they will be their accusers, to lay them all open, vnto the
great Iudge? This then is the first night-torment of the <HI>Atheist;</HI> the terror,
which he sustayneth, from a corrupt and guilty Conscience.</P>
<P>The second is, the terror of diuers strange dreames, and fearefull visions;
wherein God doth sometimes, onely conferre and talke with them: and
sometime beside, plainely shew himselfe vnto them, not only conferring, but
also appearing. For the first of those two sorts, <HI>Iob</HI> telleth vs in his Booke, that
<HI>God will speake vnto a man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 33. 14 15.</NOTE> <HI>once or twice, though he see it not, in dreames and
visions of the night.</HI> As we may see in King <HI>Abimelech:</HI> with whom God
conferred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 20. 3.</NOTE> and talked in <HI>a dreame, and threatened him with death, for detay|ning
of Abrahams wife away from him.</HI> And these interlocutorie and dialo|guising
dreames, were not vnknowne, euen to the very Heathens; as it eui|dently
appeareth by that position of <HI>Possidonius:</HI> That,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. De Diui|nat. p. 251.</NOTE> <HI>Dij cum dormienti|bus
colloquuntur: That the Gods doe oftentimes talke with men in their sleepes.</HI>
Of the second of those kindes; wherein, not onely a voice is heard, but also
an image and resemblance seene; we also reade in the Booke of <HI>Iob:</HI> where
<HI>Eliphaz</HI> giueth himselfe for an instance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 4. 12. 13. &amp;c</NOTE> saying: <HI>In the thoughts of the visi|ons
of the night, when sleepe falleth vpon men; Feare came vpon me, and dread,
which made all my bones to tremble. And the winde passed before me, and
made all the hayres of my flesh to stand vp. Then stood one; and I knew not his
<PB N="127" REF="69">
face; an image was before mine eyes, and in silence I heard a voyce.</HI> And
this kinde of apparition was likewise knowne vnto the Heathen: as
appeareth in <HI>Iamblicus:</HI> who describing the visions, which are sent from
God, he saith, that they doe commonly come betweene sleeping and wa|king:
and that then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iamblic. l. De Mysteriis. c. 22. p. 52.</NOTE> <HI>Breues audiuntur voces, quid agendum sit admonentes;
&amp; aliquando Spiritus quidam, non corpulentus, non tractabilis, se iacentibus cir|cumfundit.
Qui tamen non perspicitur, sed alio quodam sensu, &amp; animaduer si|one
percipitur. We heare certaine short voices: which, of diuers things admo|nish
vs: Yea, and sometimes certaine Spirits (though not corpulent, nor palpa|ble)
doe compasse round about vs: which, though they be not visibly discerned,
yet may they, by another kinde of sense, be perceiued.</HI> The like appeareth in
<HI>Lucretius.</HI> who numbreth these fearefull visions, among the first causes, which
begate in mens mindes, an opinion of the Gods.
<Q><L>Egregias animo facies vigilante videbant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucret. l. 5. p. 226.</NOTE></L>
<L>Et magis in somnis, mirando corporis auctu.</L>
<L>Their waking minde, in hideous dreames, doth see a wondrous shape,</L>
<L>Of Bodies strange, and huge in growth, and of stupendous make.</L></Q>
By which appearance of God, so immediately vnto the minde, the best men
are oftentimes much perturbed and troubled: though there be none other
cause, but onely the Maiestie of the Creator, striking a naturall feare and
awe into his Creature. As we may euidently see, in that example of <HI>Eliphaz</HI>
who confesseth, his owne vision to haue bin with feare and trembling; though
it contayned nothing, but a most gracious and milde instruction. Then must
it needs appeare, both with terror, &amp; horror vnto the <HI>Atheists;</HI> when it giueth
them signification of Gods wrath and iudgements. Their visions, must needs
be such, as the Orator describeth, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. de Diui|nat. p. 281.</NOTE> <HI>Visa somniantium, sunt perturbatiora,
qu&agrave;m insanorum: That the visions of such men, in their dreames, are often|times
more perturbed, then the ragings of mad-men, in their fits.</HI> As we may
euidently see, in <HI>Nebuchadnezzares</HI> dreame when hee saw the watchman
comming downe vnto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 4 10. 11. 14 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and crying, <HI>Hew downe that great Tree:</HI> He
confesseth that his dreame made him <HI>sore afrayd, and troubled his thoughts,
vpon his bed.</HI> And, of this kinde, are all those dreames and visions, which
appeare vnto <HI>Atheists.</HI> They be alwayes the Messengers of Gods wrath and
iudgements. And therefore they are alwayes tormented with them, and (as
it were) set vpon the very rack by them. As the <HI>Poet Iuuenal</HI> hath notably
described them, comprizing both the two fore-named causes of their feare,
together in one sentence, namely, both the guiltines of their owne corrupt
conscience, and the fearefull apparitions of strange sights and visions.

Yea, and <HI>Plutarch</HI> hath likewise well expressed the same Argument: instan|cing
in the very same two causes of feare in the superstitious, that I haue ex|pressed
before of the impious. So that, <HI>Atheisme</HI> and <HI>Superstition,</HI> the two
extremes of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de Super|sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. To. 1. p. 382.</NOTE> are made equall in their fearing. <HI>Obliuiscuntur herilium

Maisters threatening. Prisoners, forget their shackles. Diseases, wounds, and
cancers, by sleepe are greatly eased. Onely, vnto these men, their sleepe can bring
no quiet, nor freedome from those feares, which they conceiue of the gods. But,
as if they inhabited in the Region of impiety, fearefull visions and apparitions
do infest them continually.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and this feare, which these men haue of God, begetteth a feare in them,

Out of which sentence of <HI>Lucretius,</HI> we may gather many Arguments; that
euen the most impious <HI>Atheists</HI> in the world, do inwardly beleeue, <HI>That there
is a God;</HI> though they outwardly dissemble it. For he saith, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ybe, <HI>Div&ucirc;m
perculsi timore: that they be strucken, with a terror and feare of the Gods. Erg&ograve;,</HI>
they must needs beleeue, <HI>That there be Gods.</HI> For no man feareth, that which
he beleeueth not to be.</P>
<P>Nay this testimony of <HI>Lucre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ius,</HI> if it be well examined, contayneth twelue
maine Articles of the <HI>Atheists Creede:</HI> which are all of them so true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Atheists Creed.</NOTE> so Or|thodoxe,
and <HI>Christian,</HI> that no man can disclaime from any one of them.
Whereby it will appeare, that though the <HI>Atheist</HI> would deny both God,
and all Religion, yet that hee is inwardly inforced to beleeue them: and to
ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d (euen against his will) many notable points of Christian Religion, in de|spite
of all his obstinate resolution for <HI>Atheisme.</HI> All which may naturally be
collected, from his euident feare of lightning, and thunder. As namely these
which follow.</P>
<P>First, hee beleeueth, that, <HI>There is a God:</HI> or else hee needed not to feare
him.</P>
<P>Secondly, he beleeueth, that, <HI>God is such an one, as is to be feared:</HI> or else
he would not (nay, he could not) feare him.</P>
<P>Thirdly, hee beleeueth, that, <HI>God is not an incurious God,</HI> (as the <HI>Epicure</HI>
conceiteth him) who sitting idlely in heauen, regardeth nothing that is done
<PB N="130" REF="71">
vpon the earth: but that <HI>he is a most curious and obseruing God;</HI> both seeing
all that is done, and hearing all that is spoken: or else, he neede not feare the
punishment, neither of his <HI>admissa,</HI> nor of his <HI>superb&egrave; dicta.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, he beleeueth, that <HI>God is present in all places:</HI> or else hee could
neither see his euill deedes, nor heare his euill words.</P>
<P>Fiftly, he beleeueth, that <HI>God doth not onely looke vpon things as an idle be|holder;
but also as a iust rewarder;</HI> for else he needed not to feare his behol|ding,
if afterward he intended to doe nothing. But hee feareth him as a iust
Reuenger, to execute iudgement vpon euery offender. He beleeueth, <HI>both
that God is,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 6.</NOTE> <HI>and that he is a iust rewarder:</HI> as it is in the Epistle to the <HI>He|brewes.</HI></P>
<P>Sixtly, hee beleeueth, that <HI>God is of that power,</HI> as is able to humble, and
to inflict due punishment, vpon the greatest Prince and Pote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tate of the
World.</P>
<P>Seuenthly, he beleeueth, that <HI>Lightning</HI> and <HI>Thunder</HI> doe not come, either
by <HI>Chance,</HI> or by <HI>Nature:</HI> but that they haue <HI>God himselfe</HI> for their maker.
For else, though he feared them, yet he needed not to feare <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>Eightly, he beleeueth, that <HI>God hath made those creatures,</HI> as the instru|ments
of his wrath, to strike and to punish, when hee purposeth to take ven|geance.</P>
<P>Ninthly, he beleeueth, that <HI>Impiety and wickednesse</HI> do iustly deserue Gods
heauy wrath and iudgements.</P>
<P>Tenthly, he beleeueth, that <HI>God is iust:</HI> and therefore will pay them, accor|ding
to their desert.</P>
<P>Eleuenthly, he beleeueth, that <HI>there is a time appointed,</HI> when this paiment
shall be made.</P>
<P>And twel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, he beleeueth, that <HI>when it lightneth and thundreth,</HI> then that
appointed time is come; and that God will certainely take vengeance vpon
him.</P>
<P>All these consequents doe follow, by necessary connexion, vpon the <HI>Atheists</HI>
fearing of thunder and lightning, especially, as the arrowes of Gods wrath
and vengeance. And thus, the <HI>Atheist,</HI> who denieth, there is a God: yet is
forced to beleeue many truths concerning God. He beleeueth his <HI>Essence;</HI>
he beleeueth his <HI>Power;</HI> he beleeueth his <HI>Prouidence;</HI> he beleeueth his <HI>Omni|presence;</HI>
and he beleueth his <HI>Iustice.</HI> All this he be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eeueth, though not with
a true faith, to further his saluation: yet (as the diuels themselues doe) with
an inuincible perswasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 2. 19.</NOTE> which worketh in them both a <HI>Feare,</HI> and a <HI>Trem|bling.</HI></P>
<P>And, this we may plainely see, not onely by the testimony of these fore-al|ledged
Poets, in a generall speculation: but also by the testimony of the most
approoued <HI>Histories,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 9. 27.</NOTE> giuing particular instances. <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> that proud King,
who was as stiffe, and as vntractable, as a rocke, against the stroke of many o|ther
plagues; so that they could not make any impression into him: yet,
when the plague of <HI>Lightning</HI> and <HI>Thunder</HI> fell vpon him, (which is able to
breake euen the hardest stonie rocks) that also brake him, and pierced his sto|ny
heart; diminishing his former confidence, and forcing him to confesse,
that now he saw, that <HI>the Lord was iust;</HI> but that <HI>both himselfe and his people
<PB N="131" REF="71">
were wicked.</HI> This powerfull operation had, with that prophane man, the feare
of <HI>Thunder</HI> and <HI>Lightning.</HI></P>
<P>And the like effect is reported by <HI>Suetonius,</HI> to haue beene wrought in the

<P>But aboue all other, most notable is the example of <HI>Caligula,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eon. in vit. Caligu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ae, c. 22. p. 161.</NOTE> the Empe|rour

what a miserable and a slauish feare did this wretched man endure? He could
not so effectually, haue declared his true beleefe of a God, by building vnto

<P>5 But yet there is another time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">are of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">heists in their sicknesse, &amp; after death. L. 2. c. 5. Sect. 4.</NOTE> wherein much more hee feareth him:

of my sinnes:</HI> So that, euen the very <HI>Atheist,</HI> in the time of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">,

<L>The truth remaynes. They cast off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ayned Arts.</L></Q>
And so likewise <HI>Solon:</HI>

<P>But now, if their sicknesse doe chance to bring vnto them, but any little
impression, or apprehension of death; no tongue can expresse with what a
terror it striketh them; not onely, of their owne present death, though that be
terrible ynough of it selfe; but also, much more, with a terror of God; and
what shall become of them after they be dead. This thought is that, which
troubleth them. This afflicteth, and tormenteth them. No dreame, no vision,
no thunder, no lightening, doth so affright the <HI>Atheist,</HI> as the thought of
death doth; and what will follow, after death. Because, <HI>Lightening</HI> and
<HI>Thunder</HI> doe represent vnto him, but onely a present, and a bodily death:
but the cogitation of a state after death, doth strike him, with a feare of an e|ternall
death. As is noted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">obaeus Serm. 42. p. 279.</NOTE> by <HI>Zaleucus,</HI> in the proeme of his lawes: <HI>Mori|turos

men, when they begin to draw on vnto their death, haue in them, a fresh remem|brance,
of all those wrongs and euills, which they haue done in their life: and
there presently inuadeth them, a grieuous repentance and sorrow, for commit|ting

them: and then, they feele in their hearts, an earnest with and desire, that
all their former life had beene vertuous, and pure.</HI> Yea, and the same obser|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="5 letters">

Know this (&ograve; Socrates) for a certaine, that when a man is once come

him&punc; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> anxious care, of very many things, which before, in his former
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">. For then, he beginneth to doubt with himselfe, whether those

(which before he was wont to deride, as mere fables) now may not
(h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">) be truths: which thought, doth very greatly afflict, and vexe his minde.</HI>
So likewise, <HI>Tullie: Morbo graui &amp; mortifero afflictis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">c. l. 1. de diuin. p. 251.</NOTE> occurrunt plerum&abque;

draw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nto their death, there doe walke before their eyes, the images of dead
men: then they onely thinke of vertue, and then they deepely repent, of all those
sinnes and offences, which before they haue committed.</HI> Thus they, that will not
feare God, in the time of their life, are driuen to feare the Deuill, at the time
of their death, and to tremble at the thought of that eternall punishment,
which they feare to be after death, decreed for them, by God. As we may e|uidently
see, in <HI>Bion</HI> of <HI>Boristhenes:</HI> who seeing himselfe to be neere vnto his
death, he was so afraid of it, that he would haue endured any torment, rather
then to haue di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">La&euml;rt. in Vita Bion. p. 145.</NOTE> as <HI>Laertius</HI> reporteth it: <HI>Morbo tabescens, &amp; mori per|timescens;

f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">are of death it selfe (though it be very fearefull) as because he feared, that
after his death, he should be committed by God (whom he had alwayes de|spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">d)
into the hand of the Deuill, to bee tormented. And therefore, at his
dying, he put out his hand vnto him, to bid him welcome; seeking to leni|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">
him, towards him, with this flattering salutation: <HI>Salue, Pluto, salue:</HI> Wel|come
Deuill, welcome. And this is that, which maketh the cogitation of
death, <HI>of all other t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rribles, to seeme the most terrible,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 3. Eth. c. 6. To. 2. p. 634.</NOTE> euen to the wicked
<HI>Atheist;</HI> because, after his death, he feareth a iudgement &amp;, a punishment. This
is that, which affecteth him. This is that, which afflicteth him. This is that
which tormenteth him. And this maketh, not onely death it selfe to be feare|full
vnto him, at the time of his dying; but also, the very remembrance of
death, to be bitter vnto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 41. 1.</NOTE> in the time of his florishing. <HI>&ocirc; Death, how bit|ter
is the remembrance of thee, vnto a man, that liueth at rest, in his riches?</HI>
Bitter, not onely for the losse of all those good things, which he respecteth;
<PB N="134" REF="73">
but also, much more, for the feare of those euill things that he expecteth. As
<HI>Tully</HI> obserueth of <HI>Epicurus:</HI> that, though no man seemed more to contemne,
both <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Death;</HI> yet that no man feared more,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> both the one, and the
other. <HI>Non quenquam vidi, qui magis, ea quae timenda esse negaret, timeret:
Mortem dico, &amp; Deos.</HI> Thus you see, that, howsoeuer some men in the time of
their health, may so hoodwinke their conscience, and so obscure their owne
knowledge; as (for some short time) to thinke, There is no God: yet that
mist is soone dispelled; and the contrary opinion hath many returnes
vnto them; and cannot bee repelled by them: but, as the Poet very truly
obserueth:
<Q><L>Naturam expellas furc&acirc;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> tamen vs&abque; recurret.</L>
<L>Though thou do Nature striue, with forke and force t' expell,</L>
<L>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t still she will retire, and all thy force repell.</L></Q>
But much more, when the minde is (as it were) inforced, either by fearefull
visions, or by terrible thunders, or by the dread of death. At these three

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I Haue shewed, in the two last preceding Chapters; that (beside
the confessions of all other sorts of men, of all nations and
conditions whatsoeuer) euen the <HI>Atheist</HI> himselfe, though hee
directly deny God; yet indirectly confesseth him: partly, by
his owne excessiue selfe-loue; whereby hee maketh himselfe, a
God vnto himselfe, seruing nothing but his Belly, and the neighbour parts of
his Belly, <HI>Ventrem &amp; Venerem,</HI> as the Poet noteth of him:
<Q><L>&mdash;Nihili pendunt animi bona;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palinge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> in Sagit. p. 262.</NOTE> sola&abque; ventris</L>
<L>Et Veneris (pecudum ritu) oblectamina quaerunt.</L>
<L>They nought esteeme the goods of mind: 'tis only Belly-cheere,</L>
<L>And beastly lusts, their sought delight: as if brute beasts they were.</L></Q>
As I haue largely shewed before, in the whole eleuenth Chapter. And partly
againe, by his inward feare; whereby he confesseth another God, beside him|selfe.
Whom, though in some sodaine fits of brauery, hee do sometimes de|ny,
and would resolutely seeme at all times to contemne; yet by other so|daine
fits of feare, seazing violently vpon him, and quashing all his formerly
pretended iollity, he really confesseth him, whom he verbally denieth. Yea,
and that in farre more base and abiect manner, then any other man in the
world, whosoeuer. There is no man, that professeth the feare of God, which
feareth him so slauishly, as the <HI>Atheist</HI> doth, who yet would seeme to con|temne
him most considently. As I haue likewise declared in the whole
twelueth Chapter.</P>
<P>But yet, this is not all that the <HI>Atheist</HI> doth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three sorts of confessions of God from the Atheist.</NOTE> in acknowledging of a God. For,
if we looke further into the <HI>Atheists</HI> life, and surueigh the tenor of it vnto his
death, we shall find, that (beside those oblique and indirect confessions, expres|sed
in the fore-named Chapters) euen the most resolute and dissolute of all
that impious rancke, which glory to bee compted the deniers of God; yet
haue sometimes confessed a God, as directly, as any that euer adored him
most religiously; as expressely, in plaine and apert termes, confessing him, as
euer they vsed in their deniall of him. Which confessions of the <HI>Atheists,</HI>
may (for distinctions sake) be ranged into three diuers orders and rankes: that
Some of them be made vnwittingly, and beside their will; Some of them vn|willingly,
and by an extorted will; and Some of then both wittingly, and
willingly, by a free-working will.</P>
<P>2 For the first of those three kindes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnwitting confessions of Atheists.</NOTE> the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> telleth vs, that,
<PB N="136" REF="74">
<HI>There is not a word in the tongue of man, but that the Lord knoweth it,</HI> yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 139. 4.</NOTE> and
maketh it too. For King <HI>Salomon</HI> plainely telleth vs, that <HI>Though the prepara|tions
of the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e of man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o. 16. 1.</NOTE> <HI>yet that the answer of the tongue is of God.</HI> So that
no man is maister of his owne tongue, to speake at all times what hee himselfe
speaketh: but he oftentimes speaketh that displeaseth himselfe, to speake what
God pleaseth. He alwayes speaketh what God pleaseth, though not alwayes
what pleaseth God: no, nor what pleaseth himselfe neither. For, God often|times
openeth the lippes, euen of the wicked, and maketh euen <HI>their mouth to
shew forth his praise.</HI> And, though they themselues doe sometimes vainely
boast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 12. 4.</NOTE> <HI>that their tongues are their owne, and that they will speake, for who is Lord
ouer them?</HI> yet they are deceiued in all, for their tongues are not their owne,
neither can they speake what they would; but they haue a Lord ouer them,
who oftentimes compelleth them to speake as he would, though sometimes
that which they themselues would not.</P>
<P>This we may euidently see, in the couetous Prophet <HI>Bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">am,</HI> who, though
he were a false Prophet, yet deliuered he true Prophesies, both as concerning
Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 24. 17. 5.</NOTE> and as concerning the <HI>Israelites.</HI> Whom, though he intended for mo|ney
to haue cursed; yea, and had conceiued a curse already in his minde, yet
could he neuer bring it forth: but still, in stead of a cursing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">here came out a
blessing; his tongue rebelling against his owne priuate spirit, and obeying the
command of a superior Spirit. Insomuch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s. 13.</NOTE> that he himselfe professeth, that <HI>he
had no power to passe the commandement of the Lord, were it good, or were it
bad: no not, though the King would giue him an house full of Gold.</HI> And yet, he
well declared, that he would haue done all, whatsoeuer he could, for Gold.</P>
<P>And the same we may likewise obserue, euen in <HI>Atheists;</HI> and in those that
haue beene the deriders of God; that oftentimes, when they thinke to curse,
and to blaspheme him, God so confoundeth their language, and maketh their
tongue, so to falter within them, that in the same sentences, they doe often|times
confesse him. Let me giue an example, or two, to this purpose. There
be certaine <HI>Atheists,</HI> mentioned in the booke of <HI>Iob,</HI> who make but a scoffe at
the <HI>Omnipotencie</HI> of God; asking there most prophanely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">b. 21. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Who is the Almigh|ty,
and why they should serue him? and what profite they should reape, if they
should pray vnto him?</HI> And againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22. 17.</NOTE> a little after: <HI>What it is, that the Almighty
is able to doe for them?</HI> Where, there euidently appeareth a manifest confusi|on,
both of their speech, and of their reason. For, what can be greater madnes,
then either to call him <HI>Almighty,</HI> of whom they aske, <HI>What he can do for them?</HI>
or, to deny that God can doe any thing for them; when as they acknowledge
him to be <HI>Almighty?</HI> Their purpose was to deny his <HI>Omnipotencie:</HI> and yet
the <HI>Omnipotent</HI> so ouer-ruled their tongue, that hee made it, in the same sen|tence,
to confesse his <HI>Almightinesse: sending a spirit of giddinesse,</HI> into the
mindes of his enemies; and inforcing them to speake for him, euen with the
same breath, wherewith they intended to speake against him. As we may fur|ther
see, by another sort of <HI>Atheists,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Dauid:</HI> who made but a
scoffe at the <HI>Omniscience</HI> of God, demanding very scornefully; whether there
were any knowledge in <HI>the most High?</HI> Where note the strange precipitan|cie
of their tongue;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psa. 73. 11. Iob. 22. 13. 14.</NOTE> how grossely it crosseth and thwarteth it selfe. They de|ny
him to haue any knowledge in him, whom yet they acknowledge to bee
<PB N="137" REF="74">
the <HI>most High.</HI> Things, that cannot cohere. For, hee that is the <HI>most High,</HI>
(as the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> testifieth) beholdeth <HI>all those things, that are done here
below. Who is like vnto the Lord our God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 113. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 6.</NOTE> <HI>who hath his dwelling so high; and
yet hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">leth himselfe, to behold the things, that are done here below?</HI> Yea, and
euen <HI>Wisedome</HI> it selfe affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 24. 3.</NOTE> that <HI>shee came out of the mouth of the most
High.</HI> Which euen the Heathens themselues, do symbolically shaddow out,
in fayning <HI>Minerva</HI> (who is the goddesse of <HI>Wisedome</HI>) to haue beene bred
in <HI>Iupiters</HI> head; who is their highest god; and vnto whom they giue the ti|tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucian. Dial. Vulcani &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o|uis. p. 22.</NOTE>
not onely of <HI>Optimus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plaut. Menech. Act. 5. Sec. 2. p. 446.</NOTE> and <HI>Maximus;</HI> but also of <HI>Summus.</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Summum Iovem</L>
<L>&mdash;Detestor&mdash;</L>
<L>I call the most high Iupiter, In this to be mine Arbiter.</L></Q>
So that, in their calling of God, <HI>The most High,</HI> they directly confesse, not on|ly
his being, but also his wisedome. They confesse that same <HI>Omniscience,</HI>
which they intended to suppresse.</P>
<P>And the same intoxication may yet againe be seene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisd. 2. 2. 6.</NOTE> in another sort of <HI>A|theists;</HI>
of whom there is mention in the Booke of <HI>Wisedome;</HI> who make but
a scoffe at the <HI>Prouidence</HI> of God, affirming, that all things doe fall out, at all
aduentures: holding with <HI>Epicurus</HI> (in all naturall things) that there is, <HI>Nihil
ratione in natura factum:</HI> and with <HI>Theophrastus</HI> (in all ciuill matters) that
<HI>Vitam regit fortuna, non sapientia: There is nothing in the world,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. Deor. p. 196.</NOTE> <HI>done according
to reason:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 5. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. p. 170.</NOTE> <HI>but that mans life is ruled by fortune, not by wisedome.</HI> Thus ascri|bing
all to <HI>Fortune,</HI> as though there were no God at all in heauen. And yet,
in the same place, they by and by confesse him. <HI>Come therefore</HI> (say they) <HI>and
let vs chierefully enioy the creatures of God.</HI> They that before affirmed, that
all things fell out by <HI>chance,</HI> as though there were no God; now directly con|fesse,
that al things in the world are the creatures of God. Thereby plainely ac|knowledging,
both that there is a God, and that he is also the Creator of the
world. <HI>There</HI> confessing his <HI>Essence,</HI> where they wold deny his <HI>Prouidence:</HI> nay,
<HI>there</HI> confessing his <HI>Prouidence,</HI> where they would deny his <HI>Essence.</HI></P>
<P>And a like inuolution, is obserued by <HI>Laertius,</HI> in <HI>Theodorus,</HI> called <HI>Atheos.</HI>
Who, though he were perswaded, that there were no gods; yet hee, rayling
vpon one, that before had offended him, he told him in his passion, <HI>that he was
one that was hated of all the Gods.</HI> Thus pleaseth it God oftentimes to ine|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iate
the mindes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert. in vit. A|ristip. p. 78.</NOTE> and to confound the tongues of <HI>Atheists.</HI> And so to make
them in one and the same place, with one &amp; the same breath, to confesse him,
when they think to blaspheme him: and directly to speake for him, when they
think indirectly to speake against him. Which manner of speaking the truth so
vnwittingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lact. l. 6. c. 8. p. 333.</NOTE> <HI>Lactantius</HI> interpreteth to be a kinde of prophecie. <HI>Ego quidem,
eos, qui vera imprudenter loquuntur, sic habendos puto, tanqu&agrave;m diuinent, spi|ritu

as if they were inspired with some diuining spirit.</HI> And we may see his obser|uation
apparently verified,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 11. 50. 51.</NOTE> in <HI>Caiaphas</HI> his prophecying: who deliuered a
most excellent prophecie of Christ: and yet he knew not what he said.</P>
<P>3 Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnwillingcon|fes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s of A|thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</NOTE> as God sometimes worketh his enemies to confesse him, by con|founding
of their tongues, and making them to speake vnwittingly against
themselues: so doth he it oftentimes, by inforcing their confessions, and ex|torting
<PB N="138" REF="75">
them from them against their willes. Thus dealt hee with
King <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> who was at the first so irreligions, that, when as <HI>Moses</HI> char|ged
him in the name of God, <HI>Thus saith the Lord;</HI> hee presumptuously de|manded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 5. 2.</NOTE>
<HI>Who is the Lord?</HI> as holding scorne to obey him. But yet, afterward,
he being scourged by the righteous hand of God, and brought vnto some
better vnderstanding of himselfe, he was forced to confesse, that <HI>the Lord
was iust,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 9. 27. 8. 28.</NOTE> <HI>and righteous; but that both he, and his people, were wicked and im|pious:</HI>
Yea, and <HI>beseech Moses, to pray for him, vnto the same God,</HI> whom be|fore
hee had most impiously contemned, and despised. Thus dealt God
likewise with <HI>Herod Agrippa:</HI> who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosep. l 19. Anti|quit. p. 565. Act: 12. 21. 22. 23.</NOTE> araying himselfe, one day, in most glo|rious
Apparell, spangled all ouer, and spred with plates of gold and pre|cious
Stones, assembled all the people, to speake vnto them, in a solemne
Oration: wherein hee purposely so disposed himselfe, that the shine of the
Sun-beames should reflect vpon his fore-said Spangles, and Iewels: through
which artificiall reflexion, he seemed to shine more bright then the Sunne.
With which glorious sight, and his eloquent Oration, the people being stu|pefied,
they gaue him this impudent acclamation; that <HI>His speech then vnto
them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 12. 21. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>was the voice of a God, and not of a man.</HI> Vnto which their impious
assentation, he more impiously assenting, God sent his Angell, presently to
strike and to punish him. Who, quickly finding this stroke to be mortall,
and that it was inflicted vpon him from heauen; though before he was silent,
and would not confesse God, but was well ynough contented, that the peo|ple
should substitute him into his stead: yet now, hee confessed him, most
humbly; acknowledging both the peoples error, and his owne mortalitie.
Whose repentant confession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioseph: vbi supra.</NOTE> is notably expressed by <HI>Iosephus,</HI> in these words.
<HI>Conuersis in amicos oculis; En (inquit) Ille ego, vestra appellatione, Deus, vitam
relinquere iubeor; fatali necessitate, mendacium vestrum coarguente: &amp; quem
immortalem salut&acirc;stis, ad mortem rapior. Sed ferenda est voluntas coelestis
Numinis. He casting his eyes, vpon his flatt'ring friends: Now behold me (saith
he) whom, but euen now, you saluted for a God; how I am commanded to forsake
this world: my fatall necessitie conuincing your flatterie of a lie. He, whom
you blazoned to be immortall, am now carried violently vnto my death. But it is
meet, to be subiect, vnto the will and pleasure of the highest God.</HI></P>
<P>This notable confession, hee made before he died: which, if hee would haue
made in time, hee had surely liued. Thus likewise, God dealt with <HI>Antiochus
Epiphanes:</HI> who was so madded with malice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Mac. 1. 46.</NOTE> against the God of <HI>Israel;</HI> that
he blasphemed his Name, ouerthrew his Altars, destroyed his Temple, vio|lated
his Lawes, and persecuted his People; yea and that with all the im|manest
examples of the bloodyest crueltie, that he could possibly deuise. No
<HI>Atheist,</HI> in simply denying of God, could be so great an enemie vnto him,
as this prophane King was, in fighting against him. But the hand of God
so seazed vpon him, and smote him with so sore and incurable a disease, that
it forced both his pride and his malice to submit; and to begin his forced
submission with this humble Confession;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Mac. 9. 10. 11. 12. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>It is meete to be subeict vnto God,
&amp; that a man, who is mortall, should not thinke himselfe aequal vnto God through
pride.</HI> Making many vowes and supplications, vnto that same God, in vaine,
whom before he had compelled all his people to blaspheme.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="75">
And a very like example is reported by <HI>Eusebius,</HI> of the Emperour <HI>Maxi|minus,</HI>

expressely noteth in the very same case. <HI>Te miror, Antoni,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic Philip. 2. p. 553.</NOTE> <HI>quorum facta imi+tere,

who haue committed grieuous sinnes.</HI> And he had good cause to feare it, as the
sequell plainely shewed. For, there was no one stroke of Gods vengeance,
inflicted vpon the one, but that the same was after, inflicted vpon the other.
So that, they might seeme to haue beene <HI>Brothers in this euill</HI> too, as well as
in the former: in <HI>malo poenae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. l. 2. cont. Marcion. c. 14. p. 375. 2. Mac. 9 5. Euseb. l 8. Hist. c. 17 p. 1 8. 2. Mac. 9. 5.</NOTE> as well as in <HI>malo culpae; in malo supplicij,</HI> as in
<HI>malo delicti:</HI> as <HI>Tertullian</HI> distinguisheth them.</P>
<P>For first, as <HI>Antiochus</HI> was strucken with the reuenging hand of God: so
likewise was <HI>Maximinus</HI> too. <HI>Corripuit eum supplicium, diuinit&ugrave;s ill atum. A
punishment from heauen did sodainly attach him.</HI> Secondly, as <HI>Antiochus</HI> his
<PB N="140" REF="76">
plague was seated into his bowells,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Mac. 9. 5. Euseb. ibid.</NOTE> which tormented him with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> as <HI>Antiochus</HI> his plague breake out into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> like|wise
did <HI>Maximinus</HI> his too. He had, <HI>in imis partibus, vlcus sistulosum. Hee
had a fester'd vlcer in the bottome of his belly.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mac. 9 9.</NOTE> as there issued out of the body of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> an infinite multi|tude

<P>Fiftly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mac. 9. 9.</NOTE> as those wormes of <HI>Antiochus</HI> bred so noysome a stinke, that they
made him odious, both to himselfe, and others: so likewise did <HI>Maximinus</HI>
his too. He did,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. ibid. p. 109.</NOTE> <HI>laethi fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">um foetorem exhalare, vt Medicorum aliqui incredi|bilem

insomuch that diuers of his Phisitions not being able to endure his abominable
sauour, were killed with the very ayre.</HI> And, in these miserable torments, they
both of them exhaled their execrable soules. Thus exactly did God proceed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mac 9. 28.</NOTE>
from point to point, in all the seuerall degrees of their punishment; equalling
the one of them vnto the other in their vengeance, as they had equalled
themselues together in their wickednes. Thereby plainely declaring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 5. 4. Heb. 11. 6.</NOTE> that he
is (<HI>though a patient</HI>) yet a <HI>most iust Rewarder;</HI> proportioning exactly the mea|sure
of his <HI>Iustice,</HI> according to the measure and proportion of the wickednes.</P>
<P>But to proceede on to the third part of our comparison; which is their
confession, and repentant recantation, the point which most properly be|longeth
vnto our present Treatise. As those two profane Kings did answere
one another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 27. 19.</NOTE> as exactly, as two faces vse to do <HI>in the water,</HI> both in their <HI>im|piety,</HI>
and in their <HI>calamity;</HI> so did they likewise in their <HI>Palinodie.</HI> For first,
as <HI>Antiochus,</HI> being seazed vpon, by Gods <HI>Iustice,</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gan straightway to see
his owne iniustice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mac. 9. 11. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">seb. l 8. Hist. c. 18. p. 109.</NOTE> and wickednesse: so likewise did <HI>Maximinus</HI> too. <HI>C&ugrave;m
tantis malis afflictaretur, tandem sentire coepit, quae contra pios Dei cultores gesse|rat.
When hee once was afflicted with so many euills, then did hee beginne
to haue a sense of those euills which hee himselfe had inflicted vpon
Gods holy Seruants.</HI> Secondly, as <HI>Antiochus</HI> was inwardly perswaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Mac. 6. 12. 13.</NOTE>
that all those euills inuaded him, onely for his impiety against the God of the
<HI>Iewes,</HI> in persecuting his seruants: so was <HI>Maximinus</HI> perswaded, that all his
euills happened, onely for his impiety against the God of the <HI>Christians,</HI> in
persecuting his seruants. <HI>Haec se,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. l. 9 Hist. c. 10. p. 116.</NOTE> <HI>proper insantam contra Christum praesump|tam,

haue bene iustly inflicted for his impious praesumption and fury against Christ.</HI>
Thirdly, as <HI>Antiochus,</HI> repenting of his wickednesse, published new edicts,
in fauour of the <HI>Iewes:</HI> so likewis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> did <HI>Maximinus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mac. 9. 14. 15. Iuseb. l. 8. Hist. c. 18. p. 109.</NOTE> in fauour of the <HI>Christi|ans.

Christians, should be inhibited; and their Churches againe repayred.</HI> Fourthly,
as <HI>Antiochus</HI> prayed vnto that same God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mac. 9. 13. Euseb. ibid.</NOTE> whom before he blasphemed: so
likewise did <HI>Maximinus.</HI> He did, <HI>Deo omnium, delicta sua confiteri. Hee con|fessed

God, by his plagues and punishments, extort from the mouthes of these
two his most notable enemies: the one of them, for the credit of his Law:
the other, of his Gospell: so triumphing by his iustice, ouer their impiety and
wickednesse.</P>
<P>Another such like extorted confession,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> l. 6. c 2 p 511.</NOTE> did God againe force, from the
Emperour <HI>Iultan;</HI> although proceeding from a farre vnlike passion. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e, be|ing

Yea, and that very iustly. For hee, not contented to renounce the
saith of <HI>Christ,</HI> but boyling with an vnplacable hatred against him, spent all
the whole time of his wicked <HI>Apost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">y,</HI> in persecuting of <HI>Christians,</HI> with all

<P>Which confession of his, drew another like confession, from another of

<P><PB N="142" REF="77">
In which three last examples, it is not vnworthy of our obseruation, to note
the seuerall humours, wherewith they were possessed, in making those confes|sions:
The first of them, making it, in meere sorrow and contrition: The se|cond,
in stomacke and indignation: The third, in lightnesse and derision.
But yet,

<L>Laugh out a truth?</L></Q>
Thus, God directed all their seuerall passions (yea, euen the prophanest of
them) to draw from all of them, a true confession of him.</P>
<P>Another like confession, did God also inforce out of the mouth of <HI>Tullus
Hostil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us:</HI> Who succeeding to <HI>Numa</HI> in his Kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Numae. p. 156.</NOTE> and being a martial|minded

nothing else, but only the effeminating and weakening of mens minds. But he,
being smitten with the stroke of Gods iustice, &amp; cast into a grieuous &amp; a dan|gerous
sicknes; in the end, repented him of his prophanenesse, renouncing his
former vngodly opinion. <HI>Morbo graui ac multiplici, ad mutandum sententiam

extremitie of his sicknes, did so both abate his strength, &amp; so abase his spirits; that
he, who before thought nothing more vnworthy the maiestie of a King, then once
to stoop vnto any action of Religion, now grew, vpon the suddaine, most seruile, &amp;
slauish vnto all superstition: which he not onely obserued himselfe, but also trans|fused
into all his Subiects.</HI> But yet, he, not seeking vnto the true God, but
changing one kinde of superstition for another, was at the last, destroyed by
Lightning and Thunder. Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eutrop. l. 1. p. 401.</NOTE> and (as <HI>Eutropius</HI> reporteth it) <HI>Fulmine ictus,

his whole house and family with him.</HI></P>
<P>Yet another like confession (and by the like meanes) did God againe ex|tort,
out of <HI>Bion</HI> of <HI>Boristhenes:</HI> who was so confirmed and obstinate an <HI>A|theist,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert. in vita Bion. p. 144. &amp;c.</NOTE>
that all the time of his health, he denied there was any God: but in his
age, he being strucken with a most grieuous sicknesse, and finding it to be the
<HI>finger of God: inductus est, poenitentiam agere super ijs, quae pecc&acirc;rat in Deum:
He was thereby induced to repent him of all his impieties against God.</HI> Whose

Gods, when he would haue them, and none, when he would none?</HI> Thus, all those
professed and noted <HI>Atheists,</HI> haue expressely confessed a God in the end;
though in the beginning, they most obstinately denied him: detesting and
renouncing that impiety at their death, which they practised in their life: and
then, with all humility, acknowledging their prophanenesse: as Theeues vse
to confesse their offences at the Gallowes, For, as I obserued before out of

And therefore God at that time exacteth his testimony, when (of all other

Thus doth he preach both God &amp; godlines out of Hel; who renounced them
both, while he liued vpon earth. Yea, and our Sauiour Christ himselfe repre|senteth
the very same point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 16. 27. 28.</NOTE> in the historicall parable of <HI>Diues;</HI> who beeing
tormented in Hell himselfe, yet desired to haue his brethren fore-warned of
that wickednesse and vngodlinesse, which had worthily brought him vnto
that misery and wretchednesse: The meaning of all this is no more but this;
that God will force the tongues of those men, to confesse him, that haue bin
most vngodly and impudent in denying him. He that made the Deuils con|fesse
him vpon the earth, will make the Damned confesse him out of
Hell.</P>
<P>4 But yet we may meete with diuers other wicked ones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Willing con|fessions of the Atheists.</NOTE> with whom
God hath taken a more milde and gracious course: not inforcing them to

were not in the highest degree of <HI>Atheists,</HI> in denying of all Gods; yet might

<PB N="144" REF="78">
those great plagues and iudgements, which God had poured
downe vpon the Aegyptians, for the deliuerance of his seruants, he thereby
receiued instruction, and openly brake forth into this notable confession:
<HI>Now I know, that the Lord is greater then all the Gods. For as they haue dealt
proudly with them, so are they recompenced.</HI> Thus dealt hee likewise, with the
Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 9. 1. 3 4.</NOTE> as furious a persecuter (in his small authoritie) as euer the
Church had any. But yet <HI>Christ,</HI> in his great mercie, appearing vnto him,
and, out of heauen, reprouing him; he likewise receiued instruction: and,
reforming his former error, became afterwards, as zealous a Preacher,
as euer before he had beene a persecuter. In so much, that it passed of him,
as a <HI>Prouerbe,</HI> that, <HI>He which persecuted them, in times past, now preached the

<P>The like Confessions, and recantations, may be here accumulated, of di|uerse
other of the Heathens: who haue plainely renounced their impieties

they denied. It is reported of <HI>Diagoras,</HI> the most renouned of all that
are called <HI>Atheists,</HI> that he began his Booke of <HI>Poems,</HI> with this <HI>Exordium:</HI>

<L>That all things are ruled by the highest God.</L></Q>
Which may probably be thought, to haue beene the recantation of his for|mer
opinion. For, his <HI>Atheisme</HI> and impietie (if it were truely such) he had
from the common opinion of his countrie, the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Melos:</HI> which held
a scornefull opinion of all the Greekish gods. And therefore this so direct
a contradiction of his former opinion, cannot otherwise be construed,
then as his retractation. And the like may be thought, as concerning <HI>Theodo|rus;</HI>
who, for the opinion of his impietie, was likewise named <HI>Atheos.</HI> And
yet <HI>Laertius</HI> affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rt. in vita <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. p. 77.</NOTE> that euen hee himselfe had seene a Booke of
his, intituled <HI>De Dijs;</HI> and that it was, <HI>Liber non contemnendus.</HI> Which
iudgement hee would neuer haue passed vpon it, if hee had handled that
Argument, as an <HI>Atheist.</HI> For then, both the Writer, and the writing, had
beene very worthy to be contemned: which <HI>Laertius</HI> denieth. And there|fore
that Booke, being censured, to be <HI>a worke not worthy to be contemned;</HI>
yea, and that by the same man who before had taxed him for his <HI>Atheisme;</HI>
may also probably be thought, to haue contayned a retractation of his for|mer
opinion. And so likewise <HI>Euemerus,</HI> whatsoeuer his opinion was, which
among all the Heathen was so condemned for <HI>Atheisme:</HI> Whether it
were a generall denying of all the gods; or but a particular denying of the
Heathen gods: yet euidently appeareth, out of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> that when he grew
old, hee grew cold, in defending it. A manifest Argument, that he repen|ted
of his broching it. Which his coldnesse in asserting it, bred also a like
coldnesse in the peoples assent vnto it. As it euidently appeareth in those
verses of <HI>Callimachus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 1. de Pla|cit. c. 7. To. 2. p. 14</NOTE> wherein he perstringeth the impietie of <HI>Euemerus.</HI>

and yet no where perished. Which, euen <HI>Pliny</HI> himselfe ascribeth to a

decayed, vntill it were published. And, though that Booke of his, was, by
the Commandement of the Senate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lact. l. 1. c. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 62.</NOTE> in publique, burned: Yet (as <HI>Lactan|tantius</HI>

knowne to be his disclayming of their Religion, who was the first founder

breed in them a iust suspition, that they were not rightly founded in the

of his <HI>Prouidence,</HI> his <HI>Greatnesse,</HI> his <HI>Mercy,</HI> and his <HI>Iustice;</HI> more like an holy

out of very <HI>Atheists;</HI> &amp; therby, very notably, both manifesteth and mag|nifieth
his owne diuine glory. For, what greater glory can be giuen vnto him,
then that the same mouth should be forced to confesse him, which had armed
it selfe, with all obstinacy, to deny him? In which examples likewise, wee may
euidently see,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. l. 10. de Legibus. p. 871.</NOTE> the infallible truth of <HI>Plato's</HI> obseruation, <HI>That neuer any Atheist

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THE opinion of God, is so generally rooted, in the mindes of
all men; that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re is none, but doth beleeue it: none, but (at
sometime or other) doth confesse it: no not, euen the very
<HI>Atheist.</HI> Who, though he do not constantly, and piously con|fesse
God, as those men that do religiously beleeue him: yet is
he oftentimes inforced to confesse him; euen then, when he striueth most of
all to deny him. For, the beleefe of God planted in the heart of man, is like a
burning fire, that cannot be quenched; but flameth out the more, the more
men seeke to smoother it: being kindled more vehemently, by that <HI>Antipe|rista<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI>
of a contrary renitency, in those that endeauour to suppresse it: and
so, flashing out, like the Lightning, when it is in danger to be choked. And
this we may euidently see, in the two holy Prophets, <HI>Dauid,</HI> and <HI>Ieremy;</HI> who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 39. 1. 2. 3. Ier. 20. 9.</NOTE>
whenas they had obstinately resolued with themselues, to make <HI>no more men|tion
of the name of God;</HI> but to <HI>suppresse it, in their hearts: yet, Incaluit ani|mus,
exarsit ignis: Their soule waxed hot, and the fire flamed out.</HI> Their in|ward
beleefe of God, being like a raging flame, which, by a secret scortching,
compelled them to confesse him. <HI>Crediderunt, &amp; propterea locuti sunt: They
bele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ued, and there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ore they could not but speake.</HI> And so is it likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 4. 13.</NOTE> euen
with the <HI>Atheist</HI> too. Hee inwardly beleeueth <HI>That there is a God:</HI> yea and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e cannot do otherwise. And therefore he cannot chuse, but sometime con|fesse
it, for all his endeauor to suppresse and smoother it. So that, euen <HI>Atheists</HI>
themselues, who professe to be <HI>the Deniers of God;</HI> yet are found oftentimes,
to be confessors of him: beleeuing, with a stronger and more serious per|swasion,
<HI>That there is a God;</HI> then they can beleeue, <HI>That there is none:</HI> though
they vendi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ate this, as their selected opinion. For, they deny God, but wan|tonly;
but they confesse him, seriously: yea, and, euen in their denying him,
they do but, <HI>contra fidem credere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">il. in ps. 52. p. 368. <HI>Cap. 10. Sect.</HI> 5.</NOTE> as is noted by Saint <HI>Hilarie: They doe but
seeme to beleeue that which indeede they beleeue not:</HI> as I haue shewed
<HI>before.</HI></P>
<P>But, be it that the <HI>Atheist</HI> had alwayes constantly beleeued, as he confidently
pronounceth, <HI>That there is no God:</HI> Be it, that he had neuer, at any time, nei|ther
directly, nor indirectly confessed any: Be it, that he had alwayes stucke as
close vnto his receiued opinion, as an Oyster vnto that Rocke which it grow|eth
vpon; and neither in his life, nor at his death recanted it: yet could not
all this infringe the Catholike and vniuersall veritie of this generall position,
that, <HI>All men beleeue, That there is a God.</HI> For, hee that denieth, there is a God,
<PB N="148" REF="80">
may iustly be denied, to be a man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> in <HI>Lactantius</HI> his opinion. <HI>Non po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">est rati|onem

<P>But,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> what is the <HI>Atheist</HI> then, if he be not a man? I finde it affirmed, in
the writi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gs of the learned, both of <HI>Diuines,</HI> and <HI>Philosophers,</HI> both of <HI>Christi|ans</HI>
and <HI>Pagans;</HI> yea, and that by full consent; that all impious <HI>Atheists,</HI> and

<P>And therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 14. 1. 74. 18.</NOTE> the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> affirmeth in expresse and plaine termes,

surely, There is a God?</HI> And therefore, <HI>Auicenna</HI> also affirmeth (as I finde him

he is not only destitut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the reason of a man, but also of the very sense of a beast.</HI>
For, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> well obserueth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in Gryllo. To. 2. p. 102.</NOTE> <HI>There is no beast, that differeth so much from
man by nature, as one man differeth from another:</HI> especially the <HI>Atheist,</HI> who
differeth from all men, and that in the maine ground, both of religion, and of
reason. And therefore, is not worthy to be numbered among men.</P>
<P>Thus you see, how base and vile account all <HI>Atheists</HI> haue had, at all times,
amongst all wise and learned men: who haue esteemed them none otherwise,
then a kinde of vainely conceited fooles. Which is the worst kinde of follie,
and the least to be hoped of. <HI>Seest thou a man that is wise in his owne conceit?
there is more hope of a foole,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 26. 12.</NOTE> <HI>then of him:</HI> more hope, euen of a mere <HI>Naturall:</HI>
for such is the wisemans foole here. And though perhaps, those <HI>Atheists,</HI> in
the hight of their pride, and thicknesse of their ignorance, make as small ac|count
of wise men, as <HI>they</HI> can doe of them; accounting them for the fooles,
and themselues to be the onely wise: yet matters it nothing, whom they that
be fooles, doe either esteeme to be fooles, or to be wise men: but whom wise
men so esteeme. For (as the Orator very truely obserueth) <HI>Statuere quis sit
sapiens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 4. Acad. p. 11.</NOTE> <HI>vel maxim&egrave; videtur esse sapientis: To iudge who is a wise man, doth

It is fit, that hee himselfe should bee a wise man, that will assume
to iudge, who is a wise man.</HI> He is not a wise man, whom a foole accounts a
wise man: but he is a foole, whom a wise man accounts a foole: then much
more, whom all wise men. And therefore, whenas <HI>Atheists</HI> doe either de|ny
God, or make a mock of him, they do but as fooles doe, who make a mock
of euery thing: yea, euen of sinne it selfe. <HI>The Foole</HI> (saith the wise man) <HI>ma|keth
but a mocke of sinne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 10. 23.</NOTE> yea, and that euen of <HI>Atheisme,</HI> which is the grea|test

madnesse, to denie God himselfe: which is the highest kinde wherein hee

rather a mad man, Yea one that is inraged, not with frenzie, but with furie.</HI>
And thus <HI>Atheists</HI> (as you see) in the opinion of all wise men, are esteemed
not onely as fooles, but as madmen. Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo. Iudaeus. l. Qu&ograve;d mundus incorrupt. p. 1274.</NOTE> and as <HI>Philo Iudaeus</HI> pronoun|ceth
in another like case; not onely <HI>Insani,</HI> but also <HI>insanabiles:</HI> Not com|monly
mad, but incurably mad. Now how little accompt is to be made of
mad men, or of any thing, whatsoeuer they can either doe, or say, we may
euidently see, in the Prophet <HI>Dauid,</HI> when hee fayned himselfe mad: Of
whom, when as <HI>Achish</HI> very greatly reioyced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 21. 14. 15.</NOTE> at his first sight and com|ming;
yet whenas hee appeared vnto him to be mad, he was angry with
those, that had brought him before him, and asked, Whether they thought
that <HI>he had any need of mad-men?</HI> So that, if <HI>Atheists,</HI> be no better then mad-men:
as their professing of God, could bring him no honour; so their deny|ing
of him, can bring him no dishonour: But to proceede yet one steppe
further.</P>
<P>4 As many wise men haue reckoned and esteemed of <HI>Atheists,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Atheists <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e Monsters of men.</NOTE> some to

<P>Now, if <HI>Atheists</HI> be not men, what can they be else, but monsters of men?
who haue the outward shape and lineaments, but want the inward faculties

indeed the true and proper nature of man.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. de som. Scip p. 307.</NOTE> For, <HI>mens cuius&abque; is est quis&abque;:</HI> and

what can be more contrary vnto the order of Nature, then to haue the out|ward
shape, and figure of a man; and yet to lacke reason, which is his inward
forme? This much better deserueth the name of a monster, then many of
those do, at which men so much wonder. It is a farre greater monster, then, if
either a man, should be borne with foure feete; or a beast, but with two. And
indeed <HI>Palingenius,</HI> alluding to this comparison, hee called such impious per|sons,
but a kinde of two-footed <HI>Asses.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Paling. in Pisc. p. 358.</NOTE> <HI>O bipedes Asini &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>specifying more particularly, what kinde of monsters they be, in his fancy: as
if they were no better then meere scapes and errors of particular nature,
and vnnaturally degenerating into beasts. And therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. Tusc. p. 113.</NOTE> if <HI>Consensus omni|um</HI>
be <HI>vox naturae,</HI> as the Orator affirmeth; what can they be then, but
<HI>monstra naturae,</HI> who refuse to heare the generall voyce of nature, teaching

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_BVT let vs suppose, that <HI>Atheists</HI> were neither Fooles, nor Mad-men;
but the wisest, and learnedest, of all other men. And a|gaine,
let vs suppose, that they were not such a poore handfull,
and so contemptible for their paucity, as they be; but multipli|ed,
and increased, vnto the number of an army. Let vs yet sup|pose
further, that they had euer most obstinately maintayned their opinion,
without either any wauering, hesitation, or doubting; and that they had
neuer c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nfessed any God, neither sleeping, nor waking; neither in thought,
word, nor deede; neither directly, nor indirectly; neither in their liues, nor
at their deaths: (all which I haue euidently shewed, to be very far otherwise.)
Yet God, by his exemplarie punishments inflicted vpon <HI>Atheists,</HI> more se|uerely,
and more constantly, then vpon any other wicked ones, doth euident|ly
declare, not only, that <HI>There is a God:</HI> but also that he is the King and Ruler
of the world: a God, that both heareth, and seeth all their wickednesse, and
that knoweth well how to reuenge him vpon all his enemies, but specially,
vpon <HI>Atheists</HI> his deniers, and blasphemers; for whom, hee hath reserued his
selected plagues and punishments. So that, though <HI>they</HI> deny him in words:
yet he confesseth himselfe in deeds: and, by their punishments, both in|forceth
diuers of those <HI>Atheists</HI> to confesse him, who before had denied him:
and all the godly to reioyce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 58. 10. 11.</NOTE> who before had confessed him. <HI>The righteous
shall reioyce, when he seeth the vengeance</HI> (saith the Prophet <HI>Dauid:) he shall
wash his feete in the blood of the wicked. And men shall say, Verily there is a
reward for the righteous; Doubtlesse, there is a God, that iudgeth in the earth.</HI></P>
<P>For, if we looke with iudgement, into the liues and deaths, of those pro|phane
persons, that haue beene Gods most direct and professed Enemies,
and most gloried and triumphed in their impieties and blasphemies, as

appeare, that the iudgement of God hath brought them vnto a fearefull and
an abhorred end. As I will declare vnto you, by some two or three instances,
in euery one of the three forenamed Heads.</P>
<P>The most renowned, for professed vngodlinesse, are these. In the <HI>Holy Hi|storie;</HI>
King <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and <HI>Antiochus,</HI> the King of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> and the two <HI>Herods.</HI>
In Ecclesiasticall <HI>Historie; Caligula, Domitian, Maximinus,</HI> and <HI>Iulian.</HI> In pro|phane
<HI>Historie; Protageras, Diagoras, Theodorus, Socrates, Epicurus, Bion, Phe|recides,</HI>
and <HI>Dionysius.</HI> Of all whom, there was not one, that died in his nest, of
a faire and kindely death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Pet. 2. 3.</NOTE> sauing onely this last; <HI>Whose d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mnation yet slept not:</HI>
being, though respited, yet not remooued. But for all the rest of them, there
was not any one, but he ended his life, by the stroke of Gods iustice; either
mediately pronounced by the mouth of a man; or immediately inflicted by
the hand of God. For the first of them, King <HI>Pharaoh:</HI> as hee was a notable
mirrour of obdured vngodlinesse so was he likewise a mirrour of Gods most
iust vengeance: being purposely designed, and <HI>appointed by God,</HI> vnto none
other end,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. 9. 16.</NOTE> but onely to be an example of note, and eminent document, vnto
the whole world, that, <HI>Whosoeuer contemneth, and despiseth God, be he neuer so
great and mighty a Potentate, shall, for his impiety, be most seuerely punished.</HI>
For, so indeed he was: yea, and that not with one punishment; but with all the
varieties of Gods most heauy iudgements: which were by God inflicted, not
onely vpon himselfe, but also (for his sake) vpon his people and subiects. Who
were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 7. 20. 21.</NOTE> all of them, plagued, <HI>by blood in their waters; by tempests in their corne;

by Caterpillers in their fruites; by Grassehoppers in their grasse; by Murraine in

Who (as <HI>Moses</HI> expresseth their destruction in his Song) <HI>did sinke downe

of their Prince; the hardned prophanenes of an impious King, bringing a
generall plague vpon his whole Kingdome. Which plagues were so exem|plarie,
and so immediatly from heauen, that euen the very <HI>Sorcerers,</HI> who were
set to affront <HI>Moses,</HI> and to shew that all his miracles were but sophisticall de|lusions;
yet were forced to confesse, that they were Gods immediate plagues,
and iudgements: <HI>This is the finger of God.</HI> Thereby plainely declaring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 8. 19.</NOTE> not
onely <HI>There is a God;</HI> but also, that <HI>He</HI> is a God of so omnipotent a power, that
he is able to subdue the most proud and potent of all his enemies, by the basest
and meanest of all his creatures: by <HI>Frogs, Flies, Lice,</HI> and such like contemp|tible
wormes. A notable Example of that fearefull curse, denounced by <HI>Mo|ses;</HI>
that such, <HI>as will not feare and obey the Lord,</HI> shall, in euery part of their e|state,
be cursed: <HI>Cursed in the Towne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 28. 15.</NOTE> <HI>cursed in the field, cursed in their basket,
&amp; cursed in their dough, cursed in the fruit of their bodyes, in the fruit of their

<P>Now, for the second of them, <HI>Antiochus,</HI> whose sacriledges and prophane|nesse
can hardly be recounted, they were so many and so hainous: there was
neuer any man, whom the iudgement of God did cast headlong downe, from
a greater arrogancie into a greater miserie. For, he purposing, in the height of
his impiety and prophanenesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mac. 1. 2. &amp;c. 1. Mac. 1. 22.

<HI>Sacra in saccum,</HI> as it is in the Prouerbe; to haue sacked, and ransacked, and
made good prize and booty, of all consecrated and holy things: hee was
shamefully beaten, and repelled by the Citizens (as <HI>Verres,</HI> in the like attempt,
was by the <HI>Agrigentines.</HI>) And vnderstanding in <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rsia,</HI> of the ouerthrow
of two of his Armies in <HI>Iudea:</HI> he, <HI>breathing out fire against the Iewes,
and hasting towards them to take his fierce reuenge; hee was cast downe
from his Chariot, to the bruising of all his bones.</HI> But the vengeance of God not
hauing yet done with him, <HI>strooke him with a most odious and incurable sicke|nesse,</HI>
which so corrupted and putrified his body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mac. 9 3, 4. 7, 5, 9, 10. 8, 28.</NOTE> <HI>that loathsome wormes craw|led
out of it, in exceeding great plenty:</HI> whereby, the smell of his rottennesse
grew so exceeding grieuous, that it made him odious both to his friends, and
to himselfe. And so (as the booke of <HI>Maccabees</HI> concludeth his storie, noting
both the two fore-named points, of his <HI>Arrogancy</HI> and his <HI>Misery,) He that a
little before, thought that he might command the stoods of the Sea (so proud was
he beyond the condition of a man) was now cast downe to the ground. And thus
the Murderer and Blasphemer suffered most grieuously, and died a miserable
death in a strange Countrey.</HI> They be the very last words of his storie.</P>
<P>For the third of them; the King of <HI>Tyrus:</HI> who, in the pride of his heart,
called himselfe a God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ez. 26. 2. 6.</NOTE> and <HI>thought himselfe equall vnto the highest God:</HI> the

death of those, that are slaine in the middest of the Sea:</HI> Who are not onely
killed, but also commonly drowned, and cast into the waters, as a prey vn|to
the fishes. So that, though he boasted himselfe to <HI>be a God;</HI> yet should
hee finde himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ez. 28 9.</NOTE> to be <HI>but a Man:</HI> yea and a miserable <HI>man,</HI> in the hand of
him, that was appointed to kill him. Which fore-threatened destruction, was
afterward fullfilled, vpon that whole kingdome. Yea, and that, with so great
a desolation, and such incredible crueltie, as the like was neuer exercised be|fore,
vpon any Citie. Insomuch, that the Calami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e of the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> did passe
as a Prouerbe, in mens ordinarie speech. <HI>Quae, ex antiqua Tyro. These things

Citie is like Tyrus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 27. 32.</NOTE> <HI>destroyed so fearefully, in the midst of the Sea?</HI></P>
<P>For the fourth of them, <HI>King Herod the great;</HI> who was indeed the grea|test
persecutor, that euer the <HI>Christians</HI> had (for all other persecutors did
but onely persecute <HI>Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 13.</NOTE> in his members; but he persecuted <HI>Christians</HI> in
their head) he strooke at the very head of <HI>Christianitie,</HI> and persecuted <HI>Christ</HI>
in his owne immediate person: His impietie escaped not Gods iust, and
heauie iudgement. For, as he intended, most cruelly to haue murthered
the Sonne of the liuing God: so God abused his crueltie, to the murthe|ring
of his owne sonnes. Whereby, he became so infamous to the world,
that it went of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 2. Sa|tur. c. 4. p. 237.</NOTE> as a common Prouerbe, that, <HI>Melius est, Herodis esse
porcum, qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m filium. It is better to be Herods Swine, then his Sonne.</HI> But
yet, here the iudgement of God left him not: but strooke him with so many,
and so grieuous diseases together, that to reade, it, it is a wonder. Which
<HI>Iosephus</HI> expresseth, in very fearefull manner. His words thereof, be these.

more and more grieuous; God punishing him seuerely, for his former impietie.
For first, he was scorched and broyled with a lingring fire; which though it
could not outwardly be felt with mens hands; yet did it inwardly eate and con|sume
all his bowells. Hee was taken, beside, with a doggish Appetite, which
called for meat almost euery moment. Further, his intestines brake out into
putrid vlcers, and grieuously tormented him with colique passions. His feete
and flankes, swelled with a flegmatike humor, and his secrets were possessed
with an vnnaturall tumor: corrupting most loathsomely into wormes, and ex|haling
continually most odious stinkes. Yet further, hee was grieuously vexed
with the cramps and conuulsions, and greatly tormented with shortnes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">reath.
All which things considered, it was constantly resolued, amongst all Diuines,
<PB N="157" REF="84">
and South sayers, That they were nothings else, but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> strokes of Gods ven|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ance,
inflicted vpon him for his former vngodlinesse.</HI> Here was a perfect
patterne of a miserable man tormented vnder the hand of God: hauing none
of all his members exempted from his plagues; but euery seuerall part,
hauing his seuerall torment: dying, in a liuing death; and liuing, in a dying
life. A mirror of that infernall punishment, which God hath in hell appoin|ted
for the <HI>Atheist.</HI></P>
<P>And, not much an vnlike iudgement, fell likewise vpon the fift of them,
<HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rod</HI> called <HI>Agrippa:</HI> Who making (vpon a time) an eloquent Oration;

yet (as the Orator speaketh in another like case) <HI>Alieni facinoris munus|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ulum

knew it was their sinne:</HI> It being so kindly offered he would not vnkindly re|fuse
it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosep. l. 19. Anti|quit, c. 7. p. 566.</NOTE> but (though it were their blasphemie) yet did willingly accept it. <HI>Hanc

<HI>Neither repelling, nor rectifying, this their impious adulation.</HI> But God
who is iealous of his honor, and, <HI>who will not giue his glory vnto any other,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 42. 8.</NOTE>
he sent his <HI>Angell</HI> to punish that impious intruder: who smote him with
so grieuous a disease, that his body corrupted all into wormes. And thus
was <HI>his</HI> end.</P>
<P>3 Let vs now proceed vnto those other Examples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atheists pn|nishments re|corded in Ec|clesiasticall Histories.</NOTE> which before I haue

But, as <HI>Salomon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kin. 11. 14. 23. 26.</NOTE> when he had forsaken God, God likewise (in some degree)
forsooke him, and out of his owne Seruants stirred vp many dangerous ad|uersaries

grieuous wounds; as <HI>Iosephus</HI> reporteth them. <HI>Confecerunt eum, illatis certa|t&igrave;m

Who, like impious Caligula, commanded himselfe to be called, both Lord, and

was) by his owne seruants, and slaine, with no fewer, then with seauen deadly
wounds. And this was the end of that immortall god.</P>
<P>For the third of them, <HI>Maximinus,</HI> a perfect <HI>aemulus</HI> of the bloody King
<HI>Antiochus,</HI> both in the impiety of his life, and in the misery of his death;
I <HI>haue</HI> largely extended that parallel betweene them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 13. Sect. 3.</NOTE> in many points of the
comparison: both of them being strucken with most horrible sicknesses; and
both of them confessing, the stroke to be Gods. Onely, with this note of dif|ference,
that this <HI>Maximinus,</HI> before his loathsome sicknesse, by which hee
lost his life, was strucken from heauen with lightning; by which hee lost his
eyes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. l. 1. de vit. Constant. c. 51. 52. p. 1. 40.</NOTE> And this (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> affirmeth) was the stroke of Gods iustice. That
he, who before had burned out the eyes of many faithfull <HI>Christians,</HI> should
now himselfe haue his owne eyes burnt out.</P>
<P>And for the fourth of them, <HI>Iulian;</HI> whose infamy will neuer die, for his
blasphemy against Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">zomen. l. 6. Hist Eccles. c. 2. p. 511.</NOTE> and crueltie against <HI>Christians:</HI> he was very strange|ly

who, in his simplicitie, shot his arrow at randon; not purposing, either to
hurt him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King 22. 34.</NOTE> or to hitte him (as it fell out in <HI>Ahab,</HI> another profane King:) but,
without peraduenture, God directing the shooter, and leuelling the shotte, at

so sure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 26. 8.</NOTE> that (as <HI>Abishai</HI> sayd) <HI>hauing strucken himonce, he neede to strike him
no more.</HI> And so there he died, directly ascribing his death vnto <HI>Christ:</HI> as

<P>4 And diuers such like fearefull iudgements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 13. Sect. 3. Atheists punishment recorded in secular writers.</NOTE> do euen the Heathens

though his fault were nothing else, but a seeming to doubt, whether
there were a God? yet, euen that scepticall impiety, escaped not the censure,
of the <HI>Areopagitae;</HI> but, by their decree, receiued the punishment, not onely
of infamie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. Deor. p. 190.</NOTE> but also of banishment; they sentencing, that his bookes should

in the time of his banishment, he was by it deuoured, and swallowed vp.</P>
<P>For the second of them, <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">goras:</HI> who is noted, as one of the principal|lest
<HI>Atheists,</HI> in the writings, not onely of <HI>Christians,</HI> but of Heathens. He,

yet could he not escape from the punishment of God. No flight could
saue him from it. For, hee attempting diuers times to haue taken the Sea, it
euer, vpon his first entring into it, grew so raging and violent, that hee still
was forced againe to forsake it. Vntill, at last, he aduenturing, and putting all

the Saylers obiected it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ionah 1. 6. 7.</NOTE> vnto the Prophet <HI>Ionas.</HI>) And though for the present,
he turned it off, with a scoffe; yet he payd for that profanenesse, with the losse

Psalme. For, that was the punishment appointed by their Lawes, for the death
of such profane and impious persons: That they, which had made others
drinke in the poyson of their wicked opinions, should themselues, by drink|ing
poyson end their owne wicked liues.</P>
<P>For the fourth of them, <HI>Socrates;</HI> though he were a man, so rare and ex|cellent,
for all morall vertues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 5. Tusc. p. 168.</NOTE> that he is said to <HI>be the first, that euer called Phi|losophie
downe out of heauen,</HI> and brought it to bee familiar, and to conuerse
among men: yet, because his morall vertue was not seasoned with the <HI>Theo|logicall</HI>
vertue of true Piety; but, that hee was esteemed (though falsely) to
be a derider of all the Gods; the same Law, which before had seazed on <HI>The|odorus,</HI>
tooke hold likewise on him: and sentenced him to the same condem|nation,
whom it held to be guilty of the same crime. And so, hee drinking
of the very same Cup, did end his life also with a draught of poyson.</P>
<P>Now, if any man do thinke, that the iudgments of those forenamed per|sons,
are not rightly ascribed, to bee the iudgments of God; because they
were pronounced, by the mouth of men; he is greatly deceiued, in his opini|on.
For (as the Prophet <HI>Moses</HI> very truly affirmeth) <HI>The iudgment is the
Lords,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 1. 17. Psal. 82. 1.</NOTE> <HI>whose soeuer</HI> the mouth be. He (as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> testifieth) not onely
<HI>standeth among the Gods; but also iudgeth among the Gods:</HI> as not onely pre|sent
with them, but also president among them. So that, though their iudge|ment
was framed in the <HI>Councell</HI> of men; yet was it decreed by the counsell
of God. He it was, that decreed the sentence, though he appointed the
mouth of a man to pronounce it. The same God, who gaue the sentence;
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 24. 14.</NOTE> that Blasphemer should be executed, among the <HI>Iewes;</HI> was he, that gaue
the sentence, that <HI>Theodorus,</HI> and the rest, should likewise be executed among
the <HI>Athenians.</HI> So that, though they died by the iudgement of man; yet
died they, not without the iudgment of God. But, to proceede with the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="86">
For the fifth of them, <HI>Epicurus:</HI> though he denied Gods prouidence, yet
he died not without Gods prouidence: but had such a death befallen him, as
was most repugnant vnto his opinion. For, whereas he placed his whole feli|city
in pleasure; he ended his dayes in most miserable torture; being tor|mented
in the Bladder, for foureteene dayes together. For the easing of
which paine, he so excessiuely dranke wine, that thereof he died drunken: as
<HI>Laertius</HI> testifieth in his funerall <HI>Epigram.</HI>

<L>Whilst he sweete wine full fast did swallow downe:</L>
<L>The Stygian Lake his drunken soule did drowne.</L></Q>
And so, as he liued like a Swine, he died like a Swine: wallowing in all fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">thy
pleasure in his life, and dying drunken at his death. For the sixth of them, <HI>Bion,</HI>
a great derider of the gods: he was smitten with a very grieuous, and a most
painefull sicknesse. Of which, after many paineful remedies attempted in vain,
hee finally died in extreame paine and torture:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aert. in vit. Bi|on p. 144.</NOTE> ascribing all his torments to
bee Gods most iust vengeance, for his former vngodlinesse.</P>
<P>For the seuenth of them, <HI>Pherecides;</HI> who boasted himselfe in the presence
of his Schollers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian. l. 4. var. Hist. c. 28. p. 428&punc;</NOTE> <HI>That though he neuer offered vnto any of the gods, yet would he
leade as happy, and as pleasant a life, as those that should sacrifice their fattest
H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">catombs:</HI> he vpon this his vaine-glorious and blasphemous ostentation,
was suddainely strucken with a most horrible sicknesse; so grieuous and so
loathsome, that he was faine to auoyd the society of men, and to shut vp him|selfe
(as it were) in a close prison. So that, whenas any of his friends resorted
to visite him, he was growne so deformed, and so ashamed of himselfe, that he
would neuer be seene of them. But when they called to him, and inquired of
his health; he would shew them his finger through the rift of a doore, most
miserably consumed and eaten vp with lice: and then tell them that his whole
body was iust in the same case. And this, <HI>AElian</HI> reproteth as the iust ven|geance
of God, inflicted vpon him for his former impiety and irreligion.</P>
<P>And, for the eighth of them, <HI>Dionysius;</HI> it is true, that hee was a most impi|ous
and notorious <HI>Atheist:</HI> and that he had not onely sacrilegiously despoy|led,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. de Nat. Deor. p. 238.</NOTE>
but (that which is worse) irreligiously derided all the sorts of their gods,
not sparing euen <HI>Iupiter</HI> himselfe. And it is also true, that hee was so prospe|rous,
and so fortunate in his wickednesse, that he was neuer punished, neither
by fire, nor sword, nor sicknesse, by any of the gods; though he had blasphemed
them all. In so much, that <HI>Tullie</HI> pleadeth his prosperity in his impiety, as a
notable instance against diuine prouidence: insinuating, that if there had bin
any, it would surely haue reuenged such sacriledge and blasphemy. But yet, for
all that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Valer. Max. l. 1. c. 2. p. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Valerius Maximus</HI> obserueth, that his prophanesse scaped not, but had
his due punishment: which fell vpon it, in the time of his Sonne, though it
did not in his owne. <HI>Tame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">si debita supplicia non exoluit; dedecore, tamen fi|lij,
mortuus poenas rependit quas viuus effugerat: He sustained that punishment
after his death, which he escaped in his life, and had it payd home in the person of
his Sonne, which fell not immediately vpon his owne person.</HI> For, his Sonne
being driuen out of his Kingdome, and carried away (as a Captiue)
to <HI>Corinthus,</HI> was forced to liue there (as a priuate man) inglorious:
<PB N="161" REF="86">
and in the end, to take vpon him, the teaching of a Schoole, for lacke of better
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">intanance. From which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian. l. 9. var. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st. c. 8. p. 453.</NOTE> he being also expelled for his notable tyranny and
plagosity; he was forced (for his last shift) in most contemptible manner, to
beg his liuing from dore to dore, with a Pipe and a Taber. Now, what death,
or what torment could haue possibly beene so bitter vnto that olde Tyrant, as
to see this great misery of his Sonne, if he could haue fore-seene it. No drow|ning,
no burning, no rotting, of any of all the fore-named <HI>Atheists,</HI> could haue
beene so grieuous vnto his owne person, as this great calamity, which fell out
vnto his owne Sonne. For, it is the heauiest of all Gods heauy punishments,
when <HI>he visiteth the iniquity of the fathers vpon the children,</HI> especially in the
next generation. And such eminent calamity of the children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. Eth. c. 10. 11. To. 2. p. 612. 613.</NOTE> doth <HI>Aristotle</HI>
himselfe affirme to be effectuall, if not euacuate, yet greatly to shake the felici|ty
of their Parents, euen after their deathes.</P>
<P>So that, none of al the fore-named <HI>Atheists</HI> escaped the stroke of Gods reuen|ging
hand; but all of them haue died such miserable deathes, as were due vn|to
their wicked and vngodly liues. Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 55. 23.</NOTE> when God striketh men with such
vntimely and vnnaturall deathes, that they be not permitted to <HI>liue out their
dayes,</HI> it is a great argument of his wrath: as the Prophet <HI>Moses,</HI> in this very
case concludeth: <HI>If these men dye the common death of all men; or,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 16. 29. 30.</NOTE> <HI>if they bee
visited after the visitation of all men; the Lord hath not sent me. But, if the
Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them vp, with
all that they haue, and they goe downe quicke into the pit; then yee shall vnder|stand,
that these men men haue prouoked the Lord.</HI> Concluding, that their
strange and vncouth death, is, not onely the worke of God, but the worke of
his wrath. Yea, and <HI>Plutarch</HI> (vpon the like occasion) insinuateth the same.
For he noteth it, as the iudgement of God, not onely vpon <HI>Tullus Hostilius</HI>
(who was an open <HI>Atheist</HI>) but also vpon all those other his Successors, that
were wicked Kings; thar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. Num. p. 156.</NOTE> <HI>Nullus eorum obijt, secund&ugrave;m Naturae leges: That
none of them had their deathes according to Natures lawes.</HI> Which may, much
more generally be affirmed of <HI>Atheists,</HI> then of any other sort of vniust and
wicked persons: that none of them doe die faire and naturall deathes; but
all violent and vnnaturall. By which immediate iudgements of God, falling
downe so certainely, and so directly vpon the heads of <HI>Atheists,</HI> more then vp|pon
any other wicked ones; yea, and so generally too, vpon euery one of
them, without all exception; God doth much more effectually prooue him|selfe
to be, in the euidence of those workes; then all the <HI>Atheists</HI> in the world
can prooue God not to be, by the efficacy of their words.</P>
<P>5 But, here it may be obiected, that diuers of those men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Obiection answered con|cerning those Atheists.</NOTE> whom I here
condemne of <HI>Atheisme,</HI> and produce, as examples of Gods wrath against <HI>A|theists,</HI>
haue bene <HI>heretofore,</HI> by my selfe excused, and proued to be no <HI>Atheists</HI>
indeed: howsoeuer in the receiued opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 10. Sect 4</NOTE> they were commonly so esteemed.
Whereby it may be thought, that either there or here, I haue done wrong vn|to
the truth. For, if they were not <HI>Atheists;</HI> why were they by God punished?
If they were indeed <HI>Atheists;</HI> why were they by me excused? For the better
remoouing of which semblance of contradiction, I answer; that mine excu|sing
them in that place, was not simply to free them from all those degrees of
<HI>Atheisme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 10. Sect. 2. Item Cap. 10. Sect. 4.</NOTE> which God might in iustice punish; but onely to free them from
<PB N="162" REF="87">
that highest degree of <HI>Atheisme,</HI> which in the vulgar opinion was imputed
vnto them: Namely, from being such desperate and obdured <HI>Atheists,</HI> as simply
&amp; constantly denied there was any God. For, it is very true, which <HI>Plato</HI> affirm|eth,
that there was neuer in the world any such kinde of <HI>Atheist;</HI> but that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plat. l. 10. De Leg. p. 871.</NOTE> <HI>All of
those who denied God in the beginning, yet still confessed him in the end.</HI> And
that therein he held a very true opinion, I plainely exemplified, by all those
knowne <HI>Atheists,</HI> that haue beene most noted and branded for such: who
haue all of them, at sometime, and some of them, at all times acknowledged
some gods: notwithstanding they denied the gods of their owne countries;
to be truly gods. So that, mine excusing of them, was not, to free them <HI>a
toto,</HI> but <HI>a tanto.</HI> Not to free them vniuersally, from the whole sinne of <HI>A|theisme;</HI>
(which hath a great latitude, and is a body consisting of many parts
and members: as I purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 8.</NOTE> God willing, <HI>hereafter</HI> to make plaine) but to
free them from the crime of denying all gods; which is the highest pitch, and
(as it were) the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ead of it. And yet, euen this also, not by peremptorie asser|tion,
but by probable collection, onely out of those heads of their accusati|ons,
which haue beene most inforced against them, by their enemies.</P>
<P>Now, though they were not guilty of this highest degree of <HI>Atheisme,</HI> in
generally &amp; obstinately denying all gods: yet might they be guilty of many
other inferior degrees of <HI>Atheisme;</HI> for which God might iustly punish them:
and, by their example, teach others to beware of them. For, as it followeth
not, on the one side, that, because they denied their false gods, that therefore
they must needs denie the true God too: so followeth it not, on the other side,
that, because they denied their false gods, they must needs confesse the true.</P>
<P>For first, they might denie their false gods to be Gods; and yet neuer seeke
further to finde out any other, vpon a meere dulnesse, &amp; negligence of Reli|gion.
And so liue, without any opinion at all of God. At the least, for the most
part, though totally they could not. As those men, of whom the Apostle spea|keth,
that they were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2. 12.</NOTE> <HI>without any God in the world.</HI> Which is a priuatiue kind of
<HI>Atheisme&punc;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or which, God might as iustly punish those Heathens, as he did his
owne people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 4. 6.</NOTE> <HI>whom he suffered to perish, for their lack of knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, they might deny their false gods; &amp; yet therewithall, deny the true
God too. Which is a positiue kind of <HI>Atheisme;</HI> by hauing an opinion <HI>There is
no God:</HI> as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ormer was a priuatiue; by hauing no opinion, <HI>That there is a God.</HI>
Of which sort of <HI>Atheists,</HI> the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> speaketh, when he telleth vs, that,
<HI>The Foole saith in his heart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 14. 1.</NOTE> <HI>There is no God.</HI> Which wicked opinion, though
none of them all can constantly maintaine, but hold it weakly and infirmely
&amp; with many interruptions: yet might God (euen for this impiety) as iustly pu|nish
them as he did that blasphemer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 24. 14.</NOTE> who offended but in passion. And, thogh
diuers of those <HI>Atheists,</HI> whom before I haue named, haue both repented, &amp; re+canted;
wherby they might diuert the seuerity of Gods iudgement: yet might
ether their repentance be too weake to turne away the decree of their punish|ment;
as <HI>King Ahabs</HI> was: or it might come too late; as <HI>Antiochus</HI> his did: or,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kin. 21. 29. 22. 38.</NOTE>
they might, for the present submit &amp; confesse; and yet afterward returne vnto
their former wickednesse;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. Mac 9. 13.</NOTE> as <HI>King Pharaoh</HI> did. All whom, notwithstanding
their former confessions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 9. 27. 34.</NOTE> yet he iusty punished, for their former blasphemies.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they might denie their false gods, and seeke about for another; and
<PB N="163" REF="87">
yet not hit vpon the right: because they sought him no, wthere they should,
that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Athen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g. Legat. pro. c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r bib. Pat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o. 8. p. 6.</NOTE> in his owne most holy and sacred word. As <HI>Athenagoras</HI> obserueth
of the <HI>Poets,</HI> and <HI>Philosophers. Deum inquirere, tanqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m inventuri, nimia de

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">th of them, seeke God, praesuming that they could not misse him. But yet, indeed
they could not finde him, no nor vnderstand him neither. Because they sought
not the knowledge of God, by God; but onely by confidence&punc; in themselues.</HI> So
that (as <HI>Lactantius</HI> hath very well obserued) It was easier for them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lactant. l. De <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ra c. 11. p. 464.</NOTE> to dis|cerne
their owne gods to be false, then it was, to finde out, who was the
true. <HI>Tullius dissoluit publicas religiones: sed tamen veram, quam ignorabat,
nec ipse, nec alius quisquam introducere potuit. Vt ipse testatus est: Falsum qui|dem

false religions: but yet, hee could not finde out the true; neither hee himselfe,
nor yet any other of them: because it was vnto them vnknowne. Insomuch that
be professeth, That falshood still appeareth, but Truth alwayes lurketh.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, they might (in some degree) finde out the true God, and yet
ascribe his works vnto other false gods: as the Heathen did, the ruling of the
heauens vnto their <HI>Iupiter;</HI> of the Sunne, vnto <HI>Apollo;</HI> of the Seas vnto their
<HI>Neptune;</HI> and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 32. 4 28.</NOTE> as the <HI>Israelites</HI> themselues did, their deliuerance, vnto their
<HI>Golden Calfe.</HI> Which their dishonoring of him, he punished, with the death
of about three thousand of them. And might therefore, as iustly, punish the
same sinne, in the Heathen.</P>
<P>Fiftly, they might denie their owne false gods, to be gods; and yet accept of
others, as false. As we may plainely see,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. in Theag. p. 12.</NOTE> in <HI>Socrates:</HI> who openly denied the <HI>A|thenian</HI>
gods; and yet beleeued his owne familiar spirit, to be a god, which
was, indeed, but a Diuell. Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">noph. l. 1. de fact. Socrat. p. 157.</NOTE> this was not to renounce his false Religion:
but to exchange one false Religion for another, wherein, his latter impietie,
was greater then his former. For which exchange of superstition, euen <HI>Plu|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rch</HI>
pronounceth of <HI>Tullus Hostilius; that he was iustly destroyed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vit. Num&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 156.</NOTE> <HI>by lightning.</HI></P>
<P>Sixtly, they might denie their false gods, for a time; and yet relapse vn|to
them againe. As <HI>Socrates</HI> againe did. Who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. in Phae. done. p. 520.</NOTE> notwithstanding his former
denying of all the <HI>Athenian</HI> gods: yet at his death, commanded a Cock to
be offered for him, vnto <HI>Aesculapius.</HI></P>
<P>All these wayes (and many more) might those men be impious, against the
true God; though they both denied, and derided their false gods. For the least
of all which manifold impieties, God might, in his iustice, take vengeance
vpon them, as vpon the true Enemies of his true Religion: though they were
not in the highest degree of <HI>Atheisme.</HI> And therefore, there is no wrong
done, neither vnto the truth, in excusing them, from some degree of <HI>Atheisme;</HI>
nor yet vnto Gods Iustice, in punishing them, for other some.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THE maine purpose of this first booke, is, to proue, <HI>There is a
God:</HI> yet, neither by the view of his workes; nor by the voyce
of his <HI>word:</HI> but onely, by that inward praenotion, and perswa|sion,
which nature hath implanted in the minde of euery man;
<HI>That a God (surely) there is.</HI> A Lesson, not taught from one
man to another, but imprinted in all of them, by the same common nature. It
is (as the Orator asseuereth, in another like matter) <HI>Non scripta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> <HI>sed nata lex;
quam non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">idicimus, accepimus, legimus; ver&ugrave;m ex ipsa Natura arripuimus,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">usimuo, expressimus. It is not a Law, that is written in Tables; but a Law, that
is originally begotten within vs. A Law, which we haue, neither learned, nor re|ceiued,
nor read; but which, by very Nature, we haue inwardly bred.</HI> A Law, as
largely diffused into the hearts of all men, as the very humane nature is com|municated
vnto them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap&punc; 4.</NOTE> For (as I haue <HI>formerly</HI> declared) there is not any Na|tion,
neither Greeke, nor Barbarian, neither Christian, nor Heathen, but that
they haue their God; their Priests, their Temples, their Altars, their Sacrifi|ces,
and other such like naturalls of Religion. And yet, all these, so differing
one of them from another, that it euidently appeareth, that none of them
haue learned their Religion, from their Neighbours; neither by institution,
nor yet by imitation: but onely erected it of themselues, from these two
generall grounds of Nature: <HI>That there is a God;</HI> and, <HI>That hee is to be wor|shipped.</HI>
Againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap&punc; 5.</NOTE> that, as there is no <HI>Nation of men,</HI> in the world: so be there
<HI>no men</HI> of any condition, in the world, but that they haue their God: nei|ther
superior, nor inferior; Magistrate, nor Subiect; learned, nor vnlearned:
as I haue largely declared, by particular instance, both of <HI>Poets, Lawgiuers,
Philosophers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap&punc; 6.</NOTE> and <HI>Artizanes.</HI> Nay, yet againe, that, there is no particular per|son,
in the world, but, in some degree or other, at some time or other, he belee|ueth,
<HI>There is a God:</HI> yea euen those men, that doe seeme the most to con|temne
him: <HI>Swearers, Blasphemers,</HI> &amp; <HI>Idolaters.</HI> Nay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 11. 12. 13&punc;</NOTE> euen the very <HI>Atheists</HI>
themselues, who make it their profession, to professe, <HI>There is no God:</HI> yet do
euidently enough confesse him, in their deedes; though they deny him, in
their words. They doe really confesse him; both by that excessiue selfe-loue,
whereby they idolize themselues; and by that inward feare, which they haue
of another God, aboue themselues. Yea, and sometimes they are driuen to
confesse him in words too: and openly, both to acknowledge and to re|nounce
their former vngodlinesse. Finally, that, though none of all the
<HI>Atheists</HI> should euer haue confessed God; neither verbally, nor really; neither
directly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. 2. 13.</NOTE> nor indirectly: yet that God, <HI>who is faithfull, and cannot deny him|selfe,</HI>
he confesseth himselfe, by those remarkeable, and exemplarie punish|ments,
which he notoriously and constantly inflicteth vpon <HI>Atheists;</HI> more
euidently, then vpon any other sort of Offenders: Thereby, euen proclai|ming
himselfe, both to <HI>be,</HI> and to be vnto the <HI>Atheist,</HI> a professed enemy. So
that, there is no part of all the vniuersall, from God vnto the Deuill, but that
it proclameth God: no part of nature so disordered, or distorted, but that in
this one point it retaineth his rectitude, to beleeue there <HI>is a God.</HI> Yea, euen
<PB N="165" REF="88">
the Deuills themselues, in whom the greatest auersion is. Which admirable
consent of all the parts of the world together, in this one position, more then
in any other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 3.</NOTE> hath beene noted and obserued, almost by all the learned: as I
haue <HI>formerly</HI> declared.</P>
<P>2 In which their allegation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Consent of all men in beleeuing a God is alled|ged by Au|thors as an Argument of the truth of it.</NOTE> this may further be obserued (which I haue
purposely reserued, for the close of this first Booke) that the Authors there al|ledged,
haue not onely related it historically, that such a generall consent
there is, in beleeuing that there is a God: but they haue also pleaded it logi|cally,
as a good and a sound Argument, to proue, that <HI>therefore</HI> there is one
indeed: inferring the truth of the thing so beleeued, from the vniuersalitie of
mens consent, in beleeuing it. In which their probation, we may obserue this
<HI>Gradation,</HI> consisting of three degrees. First, that they affirme this generall con|sent,
and agreement of all men, without the dissent of any man whosoeuer, to
be the very voice of nature. Secondly, that they affirme, a generall consent,
in any other matter whatsoeuer it be, to be a good Argument of the truth.
And thirdly, that they affirm, that in this particular truth, which is questioned

that it compelleth all of them to acknowledge their Creator; yea, euen
those that are the most vnwilling to doe it; the <HI>Deuill,</HI> and the <HI>Atheist.</HI> Now,
how commeth this law of Nature to be so forcible in them, as to be able to in|force
them? Surely, onely by that reason which <HI>Zeno</HI> hath alledged, that <HI>The
Law of Nature is the very Law of God: Naturalem legem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. Deor. p. 189.</NOTE> <HI>esse Diuinam.</HI> This
is that which compelleth them to confesse him: <HI>That he hath giuen it for a law

is nothing else, but that Law of Nature, which God hath imposed vpon euery
creature; that they shall in some degree, both know him and confesse
him. And to this very purpose it is alledged, by the forenamed Authours.</P>
<P>4 Now, as the forenamed Authours haue esteemed of his so full a con|sent,
in beleeuing <HI>There is a God,</HI> to be a branch of the Law of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A generall Consent is an Argument of truth in all things.</NOTE> and
consequently an infallible truth: so haue diuers others collected it to bee a
truth; because there is so full a consent in it. The former sort, deducing <HI>the
Consent</HI> from <HI>the Truth;</HI> and the second sort, arguing <HI>the Truth</HI> from <HI>the Con|sent.</HI>
For the same Nature which doth <HI>Nihil facere frustr&agrave;,</HI> it doth also,
<HI>Nihil dicere frustra</HI> too. For, <HI>Nullius rei vel sine causa est ortus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. De Coelo. c. 4. To. 1. p. 556.</NOTE> <HI>vel sine rati|one
praenotio:</HI> as <HI>Plutarch</HI> truely affirmeth, <HI>There is no generation, without a
cause; nor no praenotion, without a reason.</HI> So that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. lib. de EI. 1. To. 1. Mor. p. 685.</NOTE> <HI>Nature neither saith, nor
doth any thing in vaine.</HI> And therefore, if Nature say, <HI>That there is a God,</HI>
it is not vainely said: but there is surely one indeed. Now, that which all
men affirme, they say it not of themselues; but it is Nature that saith it in
them. For, as I haue shewed out of the <HI>Romaine</HI> Orator, <HI>Consensus omnium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. Tusc. p. 113.</NOTE>
<HI>est Naturae vox: The Consent of all men, is the voyce of Nature in them.</HI> And
therefore many learned Authors, both of <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> doe reckon
such Consent, to be alwayes a concomitant of the truth: yet not following
after it, as an ordinary seruitor; but going before it, as a Gentleman Vsher.
For, it followeth not, that such a thing is true, and therefore there is a generall
Consent in it. But it followeth, <HI>There is in such a thing a generall Consent: and
therefore it is true.</HI></P>
<P>For as <HI>Aristotle</HI> obserues: <HI>Quod vniversis videtur, id, esse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 10. Eth. c. 2. To. 2. p. 730.</NOTE> <HI>dicimus. That which
all men affirme, is taken of all men, to be true and firme.</HI> And, in another place,
he ascribeth as much certainety to Consent, as vnto any thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. To. 1. p. 907 Lib. de pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">|one per somnum.</NOTE> that hath bene

divulge against their inward perswasion: then, how much more is the in|ward

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That all Arts leade to God. 2. The Metaphysicks, by two Arguments. 3. The
first is, the limiting of all finite things: as of naturall Bodies. 4. And
of their naturall faculties. 5. And yet not by the Sunne, which it selfe is
limited: 6. Both in his working: 7. And in his moouing 8. By the li|miting
also of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll artificiall faculties. 9. And finally, by the limiting of all
spirituall Graces.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I Haue in the former Booke instructed the <HI>Atheist,</HI> out of
<HI>The voyce of Nature;</HI> and proued vnto him, <HI>That there
is a God,</HI> by that naturall perswasion, which is generally
begotten in the hearts of all men. Which, like a priuate
and domesticall Schoole-master, teacheth the <HI>Atheist</HI>
that Lesson, by a secret suggestion, as it were, the <HI>A, B, C,</HI>
and first elements of Religion. The force and power of
which inward instruction, the very <HI>Atheist</HI> himselfe feeleth sensibly within
him. For, there is no <HI>Atheist</HI> in the world, so obdurate and hardened, but hee
is oftentimes inforced to confesse, <HI>There is a God.</HI> Yea, &amp; that not only <HI>against</HI>
his will, by the stroke of Gods iudgements, which extort an vnwilling confes|sion
from him; but also sometimes, <HI>by</HI> his will, and of his owne free motion,
without any violence or outward compulsion, onely by the force of this in|ward
perswasion. Nay, there is none of them all, so desperately wicked, but
that, at some time or other, in some sort or other, he will serue some God,
though he pretend to contemne all. Or, if he refuse to serue him; yet hee can|not
chuse but feare him, euen because he serueth him not: as being conscious
vnto himselfe, euen by Natures inward lessoning, that his seruice is due vnto
him. And that therefore, for his neglect of it, he is subiect to due punishment:
which is a reall confession of him, yea, and that a very strong one. Thus for|cible
an operation, hath this inward voyce of Nature, in the hearts of all men,
euen in the wickedest among them.</P>
<P>Now, hauing thus, in the former Booke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Arts leade to God.</NOTE> instructed the <HI>Atheist</HI> in this first
principle of Religion, by the voyce of his owne Nature, as of a domesticall
<PB N="172" REF="92">
and priuate Instructor: in this Booke I intend to bring him out, a little fur|ther,
and to send him abroad vnto the Heathen Philosophers, as vnto the
Schoole of more publique and expert Teachers. For that, which dame Na|ture
doth but only affirme vpon her bare word, that doe the <HI>Philosophers</HI> both
confirme by reasons, and declare by sensible Demonstrations. And though
none of all those <HI>Arts,</HI> which they inuented, doe purposely propound to in|treat
of God, as of their proper subiect; neither any of them haue this our pre|sent
position [<HI>That there is a God</HI>] for one of their principles, as <HI>Theologie</HI>
hath: Yet is there none of them, but that it affordeth vs some matter or other,
from whence we may collect, that <HI>there needes must be a God.</HI> As we may e|uidently
see, in all the seuerall parts of <HI>Philosophie.</HI> Let me giue you but a taste
of some few, for all the rest: because the Argument is not popular. And
therefore, it is but equall, that my stay vpon it should bee the shorter.</P>
<P>The instances whereupon I will chiefely insist bee these: <HI>Two,</HI> out of
the <HI>Metaphysicks: The bounding and limiting of all finite things;</HI> and <HI>the ex|tending
of mens app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tites beyond all boundes and limits. Two,</HI> out of
the <HI>Physickes: The first Cause,</HI> and, <HI>The first Moouer of all naturall
things.</HI> Two, out of <HI>Phisick: Diseases,</HI> and <HI>their Remedies.</HI> Two out of the
<HI>Politicks: the growing,</HI> and <HI>decaying of Kingdomes,</HI> and <HI>Empires.</HI> Two, out of
the <HI>Ethicks: the way to Felicity,</HI> and <HI>Felicity it selfe.</HI> Foure, out of the <HI>Mathe|maticks:
Punctum in geometrie; Vnitas in Arithmeticke; Ordo in Astronomy;</HI>
and <HI>Harmonia, in Musick.</HI> Finally, there is no Art, neither liberall, nor illibe|rall;
but it commeth from God, and leadeth to God. And this is the substance
and oeconomy of this second booke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 4. Meta p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ys. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 2. To. 2. p. 1399.</NOTE></P>
<P>2 Let vs first beginne with the <HI>Metaphysicks;</HI> which <HI>Aristotle</HI> calleth, <HI>The
first Philosophy, Primam Philosophiam:</HI> and so by degrees, descend downe vn|to
the rest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Metap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y|sicks arguments for God.</NOTE> It affoordeth vs two considerations: from whence wee may col|lect,
euen by the light of nature, that <HI>There needes must be a God.</HI> The first is,
<HI>The bounding and limiting of all finite things.</HI> The second, <HI>The boundlesse and
vnlimited appetite of mens soules.</HI></P>
<P>3 For the first of which two points; look throgh the whole world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bounding of naturall bo|dyes is the worke of God</NOTE> &amp; throgh
all the sensible bodies, therein contained, &amp; you shal euidently see, that though
many of them be great, yet that none of them is infinite: there is none of them
so great, as to be without his limit. As euen <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe, both affirmeth
and proueth, in his first booke, <HI>De Coelo.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1 de Coe+lo c. 7. To. 1. p. 559.</NOTE> Where, he plainely and categorically
setteth downe this conclusion: <HI>Corpus infinitum, in ratione rerum, esse non pos|se.
That it is a thing, contrary to the nature of things, that there should bee any
body, without his termes and limits;</HI> No, not euen the body of the vniuersall
world it selfe: as,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st. Ibid. p. 564.</NOTE> in the conclusion of the same chapter he expressely inferreth.
<HI>Vniuersi corpus, infinitu~ esse non posse, ex ijs, quae diximus, patet.</HI> Then much lesse
can any part of the world be infinite, if the whole be not. Vnlesse we should
make the whole to be lesse then his owne part: which were vtterly absurde.
And therfore all the parts of the world, must needs be limited, &amp; determined.</P>
<P>Let me giue you an instance or two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 4. Phys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. c. 5. To. 1. p. 462.</NOTE> to this purpose: and that out euen of
<HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe. <HI>Terra in Aqua; haec, in Acre; Aer, in Aethere; Aether, in Coelo
est collocatus. Ipsum ver&ograve; Coelum, nullo in alio corpore est vlteri&ugrave;s collocatum.
The Earth,</HI> that <HI>is bounded and limited with the Water; the Water with the Aire;
<PB N="173" REF="92">
the Aire, with the Fire; the fire with the Heauen. The heauen is not bounded, with
any further Body.</HI> How then is the Heauen bounded, if it be not boundlesse?
Why thus. Euery one of the lower heauens is bounded or limited, by the con|ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e,
or hollow part of his higher: vntill we come to that, which is the high|est
of all, and containeth all the rest, being contained of none. And yet, euen
<HI>that</HI> is not without his bounds, but is limited and determined, within his
owne conuexe or swelling <HI>superficies:</HI> as a man is, by his skin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or a bubble
of water, by his thinne filme. So that, there is not, in Nature, any Body, that
is infinite, nor any that is without all limit. To be vnlimited and boundlesse, is
onely the Prerogatiue of the Maker of all things: as <HI>Prosper</HI> very well, and
truly obserueth.

<L>Sed nusquam non esse, Dei est: qui totus, vb&iacute;&abque;,</L>
<L>Et penetrat Mundi membra omnia liber, &amp; ambit.</L>
<L>Ther's nought so vaste, as to be voyd of limit.</L>
<L>Both H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">au'n, and Earth, and all the world hath bounds.</L>
<L>All heights and depths haue termes, is we esteeme it:</L>
<L>Height ne're so high, be Depth ne're so pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ound.</L>
<L>Vnlimited, and no where not to be,</L>
<L>Agrees to God alone: Who wholy is</L>
<L>The whole World through, and euery least part: He</L>
<L>Within doth pierce, without doth compasse this.</L></Q>
So that, there is not any Body, in Nature, so infinite, but that it is pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">ed
within some bound and limit. Now, euery finite Body, being thus bounded
&amp; limited, it must needs haue had those bounds prescribed vnto it, by some o|ther
thing, and not by it selfe. For, euery thing, by nature, being desirous of
scope, and seeking to inlarge it selfe, as farre as it is able; if it had the setting
of his owne bounds and limits, it would set none at all; but would be as in|finite,
as God himselfe is: who hath the setting of limits vnto all things. And
therefore (as you see) hath set none vnto himselfe: but is illimitable, and
boundlesse. <HI>Nullis ne&abque; finibus, ne&abque;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hilar. in Ps. 118. p. 516.</NOTE> <HI>spacijs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oarctatus:</HI> as Saint <HI>Hilarie</HI> teach|eth:
<HI>Being no way straitned, by any space, or place.</HI> And so would it be with all
other things too; if they had the assigning of their owne bounds and limits:
they would all of them, be boundlesse. Because all bounds, be like bonds, and
like shackles, vnto all things: which they would neuer put vpon them, if they
could be without them. For (as <HI>Scaliger</HI> well obserueth) <HI>Vnicui&abque; enti,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scalig. Exercit. 9. p. 52.</NOTE> <HI>insita

The Sea, if it could eate vp the whole Earth, and make all the Globe,
Sea (as it once was) it would surely do it. For, the <HI>waters do desire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps 104 9. 6.</NOTE> <HI>to stand
aboue the mountaines;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps 104 9. 6.</NOTE> as the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> testifieth.</P>
<P>Againe, the Earth, if it could vtterly close vp the Sea, and make all the
Globe, dry-land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Esdr. 4. 13. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> it would surely doe it; as <HI>Esdras</HI> notable expresseth in a wit|ty
<HI>apologue. I came</HI> (saith he) <HI>into a Forrest, in the plaine, where the Trees held a
Councell, and sayd; Come let vs fight against the Sea, that it may giue place to vs,
and that wee may make vs more woods. Likewise, the floods of the Sea tooke
<PB N="174" REF="93">
counsell, and sayd; Come, and let vs go vp, and fight against the Trees of the
wood, that we may get another Country for vs. But the purpose of the wood, was
vaine: for the fire came downe and consumed it. And the purpose of the Sea,
was also vaine: for the sand stood vp, and stopped it.</HI> Whereby it appeareth,
that there is, in all things, a desire to dilate, and to ingreat themselues. And
therefore would neuer shut vp themselues, within bounds and limits, as it
were, in a prison; if they themselues had the setting and appointing of them.
Therefore, as it is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">l. Exercit. 6. Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 3. p. 27.</NOTE> that <HI>Nullum ens finitum, est a se:</HI> so it is likewise true,
that <HI>Nullum ens, finitum est a se. As nothing, that is finite, is of it selfe: so no|thing
that is, is finite of it selfe.</HI> But all the finite things, in vniuersall nature,
haue both their being, and their bounding of some other. And they all doe
feele within them, the imperiall power of a superior Nature: which hath ap|pointed,
and prescribed those limits&punc; vnto them: and therefore are wel content,
to containe themselues within them: as obeying the command of him, that
ruleth ouer them.

<L>And how the Ayre both compasseth, and carrieth still Earths frame?</L>
<L>Yet neither pressing burthens it, nor parting leaues the same?</L></Q>
This abiding of those things within their bounds and limits, cleane contrary
vnto their naturall Appetites, doth euidently declare, that those bounds were
neuer set vnto them by themselues, but appointed vnto all of them, by some
other, whose prescribed law they are compelled to beare.</P>
<P>Now, who can this be, that thus circumscribeth all things, within their set
limits, but onely God himselfe: who is, both the <HI>Maker,</HI> and <HI>Ruler</HI> of all
things? For, what other could set bounds, both vnto Heauen and Earth, but
onely the Creator and Maker of them both? who, must needes be God. And
therefore he it is (as the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> testifieth) that hath both<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psal. 24. 2.</NOTE> <HI>founded
the Earth, vpon the waters;</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Psal. 33. 7.</NOTE> <HI>and bounded the Sea, within his bankes;</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Psal. 104. 2. 9.</NOTE> <HI>and
spread out the Heauen, as it were, a curtaine.</HI> He it is (as the Prophet <HI>Isay</HI> testifi|eth)
that doth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay 40. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Palmo, coelos; pugillo, aquas; digitis, terras metiri: that coun|teth
out the heauen, with his span; and measureth the waters, with his fist; and
comprehendeth the dust of the earth, in a measure; and weigheth the moun|taines
in a waite; and the hills, in a ballance.</HI></P>
<P>So that, the bounding and limiting of al the forenamed things, is the worke
of none other, but of God, their Creator: who (as <HI>Boetius</HI> truly calleth him) is
<Q><L>Principium,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oet. l. 3. de con|solat. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tro. 9. p. 1042.</NOTE> Vector, Dux, Semita, Terminus, idem.</L>

And, that this was not the idle fiction of <HI>Poets,</HI> we may see by the grauer sen|tences
of the learnedest Philosophers: who casting about, with the best wit
that they had, from whence this limiting of things should proceed; haue, at
the last, beene constrayned, to ascribe it vnto God. <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> affirmeth,

opinion was likewise his master <HI>Anaximenes;</HI> as <HI>Tullie</HI> reporteth, in the very

is both the beginning, from whence all things doe proceede; and
(as it were) the place, wherein all things are contayned; yea, and the very

Now, those fiue degrees of Creatures, bee these. That <HI>some</HI> things haue
bare essence and being, allotted vnto them; and yet not either life, or sense:
as, in si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ple bodies; <HI>the Heauens,</HI> and <HI>the Elements:</HI> in compound bodies;
<HI>Stones,</HI> and <HI>Metals,</HI> and such like. <HI>Some</HI> other things, haue both <HI>Being,</HI> and

haue no naturall motion of their owne, but are onely carried, as the water
driueth them. And therefore, <HI>Aristotle,</HI> very wittily, calleth them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 3. de generat. Ani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">al. c. 11. To. 2. p. 354.</NOTE> <HI>Aquatiles

no <HI>Reason,</HI> nor <HI>Vnderstanding:</HI> as <HI>Birds,</HI> and <HI>Beasts,</HI> and <HI>Fishes,</HI> and such like.
And <HI>some</HI> things againe, haue all these powers and faculties vnited in one,
both <HI>Essence,</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Sense,</HI> and <HI>Motion,</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> too: as we see they
be in <HI>Men.</HI> And these distinctions of Creatures, are so obuious to all men,
that he, which notes them not, is more worthy to be numbred among beasts,
then among men. Now, if it should be demanded; Why a <HI>Stone</HI> hath not
life, as well as a <HI>Tree?</HI> or, a <HI>Tree,</HI> not sense, as well as a <HI>Beast?</HI> or, a <HI>Beast,</HI> not
reason, as well as a <HI>Man?</HI> wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> other reason, can be giuen of all this, but one|ly,
that those powers are not in their owne power, to take so many of them,
as they themselues thinke good: but, that they be limited and assigned vnto
them, by a nature farre aboue them: euen the same nature that made them.
And that they therefore <HI>haue</HI> them not; because that Nature <HI>gaue</HI> them
not.</P>
<P>From whence, there follow these <HI>two Conclusions.</HI> First, that all those fore|nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d
faculties and powers, though they be <HI>in</HI> those things, that haue them;
yet they be not <HI>of</HI> those things, that haue them. They haue them, <HI>in</HI> them|selues;
but they haue them, not <HI>of</HI> themselues. For then, all would haue all of
them, and none would content themselues with any part, were it neuer so
great. Would a Tree (thinke you) be content to sticke fast in the earth, as a
dead and rotten stake; if it could giue it selfe motion? Surely, no. The blinde
man, in the Gospell, that thought he <HI>saw men walking like vnto Trees,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 8. 24.</NOTE> should
surely see Trees walking like vnto men, if they could take vnto themselues
the facultie of mouing. Againe, would a Beast be content, to be so subiect
vnto man, if it could giue it selfe Reason? Or would a Man be content, to
liue here vpon the earth, if he could flee vp into heauen, and make himselfe a
God? Surely, he neuer would. That which <HI>Tertullian</HI> affirmeth of the <HI>Romane</HI>
Emperours, is true also, in all others, that; <HI>Si ipsi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. Apol. c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">1. p. 33.</NOTE> <HI>se Deos facere potuiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nt;
cert&egrave; quidem, homines nunqu&agrave;m fuissent. If they could haue made themselues
Gods, they would neuer haue continued Men.</HI> And so in all other things, as well
as in these, they would all haue all those faculties, if they could giue them to
themselues. Therefore, seeing that, which hath onely <HI>Being,</HI> cannot giue it
selfe <HI>Life;</HI> and that, which hath onely <HI>Life,</HI> cannot giue it selfe <HI>Sense;</HI> and that
which hath onely <HI>Sense,</HI> cannot giue it selfe <HI>Reason;</HI> this euidently sheweth
vnto all that haue any Reason, that the ampliating, or restrayning of those na|turall
<PB N="178" REF="95">
indowments, is not in their owne free disposition, or election: but in his
onely power, who freely bestoweth them. This is the first conclusion.</P>
<P>The second, That seeing those fore-named faculties are not in the power of
the things themselues, that <HI>haue</HI> them; therefore they must needes proceede
from some other power that <HI>gaue</HI> them; and that hath in it selfe, the whole
power of dispensing them. And that can be none other, but a diuine and hea|uenly
power. For, <HI>that nature</HI> must needes be supernaturall and diuine, which
is the fountaine and wel-spring both of <HI>Being,</HI> and <HI>Liuing,</HI> and <HI>Mouing,</HI> and
<HI>Sense,</HI> and <HI>Reason:</HI> and which hath the power, to deriue the streames of those
diuine graces, vnto all other creatures, in such differing degrees, limiting and
proportioning vnto euery seueral creature, that power and faculty, which stan|deth
best with his pleasure: To some of them dispensing, but only one facul|ty&punc;
to some two; to some three; to some foure; to some fiue: as the houshol|der,
in the Gospell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 25. 14. 15.</NOTE> distributed his Talents vnto his seruants. This inestimable
treasure of so many pretious Talents, and this admirable wisedome, which is
vsed in dispensing them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 1. 9. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">0 21. 2. 5.</NOTE> cannot, in reason, be ascribed, but onely vnto God. He
it is, that made <HI>the heauen, the earth, the sea,</HI> which haue onely <HI>being: the trees,
the hearbs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 27.</NOTE> <HI>the plants,</HI> which haue both <HI>being</HI> and <HI>liuing: the birds, the beasts, the
fishes;</HI> which haue both <HI>liuing, sense,</HI> and <HI>moouing:</HI> Yea, and <HI>Man</HI> himselfe too;

it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 28.</NOTE> in his affirming, that it is onely God, <HI>in whom wee liue, and moue, and haue
our being:</HI> naming in expresse tearmes, three of those fiue properties, which
before were named by vs, <HI>Liuing, Moouing,</HI> and <HI>Being.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and adding for the rest, which he hath not named (as a generall conclusi|on,

powers, with which he hath bound them, as it were, in strong bands; so that they
haue no power to inlarge themselues.</HI> Yea, and euen the very Heathen them|selues,
haue (by reason) beene compelled to confesse, as well in this point, as
they did in the former, that this must needes be the worke of God, and not of
any other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. De Mun|do. To. 2. p. 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">9.</NOTE> <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith expressely, that; <HI>Omnes, Aeris, Terrae, Aquae, res, Dei

<P>5 Onely here, let me answer vnto one Obiection; which hath crept into
the heads of diuers learned men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sunne is not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> of naturall fa|calties.</NOTE> as concerning the limiting of those last na|med
faculties: before I proceede vnto the rest of the instances; and that is
briefly this: That though it be apparant, that those fore-named Bodyes, be so
distinguished by their naturall properties, that some haue onely <HI>being;</HI> some
other, <HI>life,</HI> and <HI>motion;</HI> and others, <HI>sense</HI> and <HI>reason:</HI> yet doth it not appeare,
that it is only God, that hath so distinguished and distributed those faculties;
wee see not, that God doth it: but we see that the Sunne doth it: Whom <HI>A|ristotle</HI>
cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eth, <HI>Authorem rerum procreandarum:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. d: Ge|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rat c. 9. l <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 1. p. 674.</NOTE> <HI>The very Author and Parent

things in the world, as to him that ruleth all, and to him that doth all.</HI> Wee see,
that the Sunne begetteth dayly in the earth, not onely <HI>Stones</HI> and <HI>Mettals,</HI>
which haue onely <HI>being;</HI> but also <HI>Trees</HI> and <HI>Plants,</HI> which haue also <HI>life;</HI> yea,
and <HI>Flyes</HI> and <HI>Wormes</HI> too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diodor. Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ul. l. 3 p 69.</NOTE>
which haue both <HI>sense</HI> and <HI>motion:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> in Arc. p. 322.</NOTE> yea, and if wee
should beleeue the reports of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> it hath also begotten <HI>Men,</HI> with
their <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Vnderstanding.</HI> So that this great worke, which wee ascribe
vnto God; and which we vse as an Argument, to perswade men, that <HI>there is a
God;</HI> ought rather to be ascribed vnto the <HI>Sunne:</HI> by whom we see it appa|rently
done. And therefore doth not leade vs by any consequence, vnto Gods
vnlesse we will acknowledge the Sunne to be God.</P>
<P>But vnto this obiection I answer: that if the Sunne performe this by his
owne power and vertue, it must then needes bee a God; as performing
that worke, which is proper vnto God. For who can giue <HI>life</HI>
and <HI>motion,</HI> and <HI>sense,</HI> and <HI>reason,</HI> vnto things, by his owne power, but onely
the <HI>Maker</HI> and <HI>Creator</HI> of all things? Who by those very workes declareth
himselfe to be a God. So that our fore-named instances, in leading vs vnto
<PB N="180" REF="96">
the Sunne, doe leade vs vnto a God; if he be the giuer and distributer of those
powers, by his owne strength and power. But, if the Sunne doe this not by
his owne proper power, but onely by the delegated power of his <HI>Maker</HI> and
<HI>Creator,</HI> who vseth him but as his minister: then doe our fore-named instan|ces
leade vs vnto a God; who is aboue the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and is the God of the <HI>Sunne.</HI>
Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> ibid.</NOTE> and this, euen <HI>Trismegistus</HI> himselfe confesseth, in the very same place.
For, though he professed of the <HI>Sunne,</HI> that hee doth, <HI>Hunc colere, ipsum&abque;
opificem agnoscere:</HI> Yet hee addeth this restriction; <HI>Post primum illum, &amp;
vnum: That though he acknowledge him, to be the Maker of all things; yet that
it is, but vnder another, who is farre superior; being the first, and the onely, be|fore
all the rest.</HI> So that, both wayes, the limiting and distributing of those
naturall faculties, in such diuers measures, vnto diuers subiects, doe necessari|ly
leade vnto a God: either vnto the true one; or vnto one in opinion. Which
against the <HI>Atheist,</HI> is fully sufficient. That, by way of supposition. But now,
for our position: it must be resolutely held, that, though the <HI>Sunne</HI> doth per|forme
diuers of those great works, in giuing those faculties vnto certaine
bodies, according vnto their seuerall capacities: yet that it neither giueth
them all (for it giueth not <HI>Reason,</HI> which is the chiefest of all) neither yet those
which it giueth, doth it giue, by his owne vertue; but onely by a kinde of li|mited
facultie, which God his Creator hath giuen vnto it, to worke thus and
thus, as the matter is prepared. So that, if the Sunne (the supposed giuer of all
those other faculties) could but take vnto it selfe the facultie of speaking, it
would certainely make the very same protestation, which was made by Saint
<HI>Peter,</HI> in another like matter. <HI>Ye men of Israel, why maruaile ye at this, or why
looke ye so stedfastly on vs?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 3. 12. 13. 16.</NOTE> <HI>as though we, by our owne power, had made this man
to goe. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iaacob, he hath glorified his Sonne.&mdash;
And his name it is, that hath made this man sound.</HI> And this same profession
which the Apostle here maketh, for giuing motion vnto this Lame man,
would the Sunne also make (if it were able to speake) for his giuing of motion
vnto any other thing. Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t. l. 2. c. 5. p. 84.</NOTE> and euen for his owne motion. For (as <HI>Lactantius</HI>
truly teacheth) <HI>Inest syderibus ratio, ad peragendos meatus suos apta: s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d Dei
est ill a ratio, qui &amp; fecit, &amp; regit omnia; non ipsorum syderum quae mouentur.
The Starrs haue a meane and a power in them, to dispatch their owne motion.
But it is onely God, that hath giuen that power vnto them; Who is both the ma|ker,
and ruler of all things. It is not a power that is proper to the Starrs.</HI> And
therefore, <HI>Trismegistus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. in As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lep. c. 10. p. 523.</NOTE> though hee ascribe much to the Sunne; yet he calleth
him, but, <HI>Secundum Deum, hunc mundum gubernantem: But a second Go|uernour
of the world, vnder God.</HI> Whereby it appeareth, that the Sunne is
not that infinite limitour, which giueth seuerall gifts, and setteth seuerall
bounds, vnto all other things; being it selfe boundlesse; but, that it must be
numbred, among things limited. Yea, and that a great deale more straitly li|mited,
then many other things, that seeme inferior vnto it. And this may
euidently be seene, both in his Working-power; and also, in his Mouing-power.</P>
<P>6 For first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sunne is limited in his working.</NOTE> for his working-power; it is most plaine and euident, that the
Sunne is two wayes restrayned in it, that is both, in the Matter, and in the
Manner of his working. By both which it appeareth, that hee hath not an
<PB N="181" REF="96">
omnipotent, but a limited power in him.</P>
<P>And first, for the matter. We see this by experience, that it is not in the Suns
power, to put euery forme vpon euery matter: but is confined, to the habilitie
and capacitie of the matter, as it is either prepared, or vnprepared by nature.
The S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nne cannot, by that heate, put hardnesse vpon waxe, by which, hee
putteth hardnesse vpon a stone: Nor, by that heate, put softnesse vpon clay,
by which hee both softneth and dissolueth the Snow. This cannot be done
by him: because the matter will not suffer him. Againe, the Sunne hath not
power to giue euery naturall propertie, vnto euery naturall body. Hee can|not
giue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> vnto a Tree, vpon that hard Rocke, where yet hee giueth <HI>Be|ing</HI>
vnto a Stone: Neither can hee giue being vnto a Stone, within that soft
Dung-hill, where yet he giueth both being, and Liuing, and Mouing, and
feeling, vnto a Worme. These things, hee can worke in one place; because
the matter is prepared for him: in another hee cannot; because the matter is
vnprepared for such and such a forme. For, hee cannot worke any where be|yond
the possibilitie or receptiuitie of his matter. Which euidently sheweth
that the Sunne is not the first and vnlimited limitour, which distributeth
those faculties, as he himselfe pleaseth: but is a meere seruant, that is limited
himselfe, to doe no more then his Master pleaseth. Now, who is it, that li|miteth
this power vnto the matter; that some matter should only be capable
of life; some other both of life, and sense; some other (beside these) of mo|tion;
and some of none of these, but onely of simple Being? This distribu|tion
the Sunne cannot make, in euery matter, but onely where the habilitie
thereof will suffer. Therefore, the limitour of this susceptiue power vnto
the matter, in such differing degrees, and measures, and manners, can (in
truth) be none other, but onely that omnipotent <HI>Creator</HI> of the <HI>Matter:</HI> of
whom it is sayd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 1. 2.</NOTE> in the beginning of Gods Booke; that, <HI>In the beginning,
God made Heauen and Earth: and the Earth was voyde, and without forme.</HI>
God hauing <HI>therefore</HI> made the <HI>matter,</HI> without any certaine forme of his
owne, that it might be capable of euery other forme. And yet, not delegating
so large a power vnto any Creature, as to superinduce any forme whatsoeuer,
but onely as hee limiteth the capabilitie of the matter. And yet, vnto himselfe
he hath reserued an infinite power, to put any forme vpon any matter. Which
hee alwayes findeth plyant, and obsequent to his pleasure, euen against the
proprietie of its owne particular nature.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. l. 4. De Praepar. c. 8. p. 155.</NOTE> For (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> citeth out of <HI>Dio|nysius)

primam se causam accommodare. It is not to be spoken, that the first cause
of all things, should (like an Artificer) be tied to the aptnesse and habilitie of
his matter.</HI> For, he can easily worke, beyond all the power and possibilty of
it. He can giue weight vnto the fire, which is the lightest of all things; and
make it to fall perpendicularly downe, as it were a showre of raine; as he did
vpon the <HI>Sodomites.</HI> He can giue hardnesse, and consistence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 29 24.</NOTE> vnto the soft,
and fluide waters, and make them to stand as stiffe as a wall&punc;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 14. 22.</NOTE> as hee did vnto

vnto the <HI>blinde man.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3. 9.</NOTE> He can make the mouth of a dumbe Asse to speake, as
hee did vnto <HI>Balaam.</HI> Yea, and hee can; of very <HI>Stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> Supartium. p. 339.</NOTE> rayse vp Children
vnto Abraham.</HI> Though <HI>Galen</HI> denie that power vnto him. But yet the
<PB N="182" REF="97">
Scripture ascribeth it: which is of greater credit. Yea, and euen the
Heathens <HI>Mythologie</HI> attribut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s it, in <HI>Deucalions transformation of Stones
into men.</HI>

<L>In little space, by Gods high power, which all things makes,</L>
<L>Stones, cast from out Mans hand, put on mens shapes.</L></Q>
So that God, who is the true limiter and distributer of these faculties, is
not limited himselfe vnto any matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> though <HI>Plato</HI> thinke he be: but, he can
make, at his pleasure, <HI>Ex quovis ligno Mercurium.</HI> He can make, <HI>Quidlibet ex
quolibet:</HI> which the Sunne cannot. And therefore, it is God alone (and not
the Sunne) that is both the Determiner, and the Dispenser of those naturall
faculties, vnto their naturall bodies. Giuing where, and when he pleaseth, a
passiue possibilitie vnto euery matter, of receiuing euery forme. Which pow|er
he hath not left, in the power of the Sun.</P>
<P>Now for the manner of his working, it may againe be demanded: Who
it is, that hath so co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fined, and circumscribed the power of the Sunne, that,
out of such a matter, he should be able to produce onely <HI>life;</HI> and yet, out of
another matter, to produce both <HI>life,</HI> and <HI>sense?</HI> This euidently sheweth, that
the Sunne is not able, to worke and effect what it will, where it will; but, like
a meere Artificer, is co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fined to the hability, or imbecillity of his matter, and
can go no further. Which sheweth that he is not an omnipotent worker, as
is God the Creator.</P>
<P>7 And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sunne is limited in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> as the Sunne is restrayned in his working-power; so that he can|not
effect, <HI>what</HI> he will: so is he likewise in his mouing-power; so that he can|not
goe, <HI>whither</HI> he will. But is, as strictly tied vnto his set-motion, as a Mill-horse
to his Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">: which cannot goe possibly out of his Circle. For, when
he commeth to a certaine point Northward, hee can go no further that way;
but returneth <HI>back</HI> againe. And, when he commeth to a certaine point South|ward,
he can go no further t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">at way; but returneth <HI>backe</HI> againe. Whereup|on
those two points are called his two <HI>Topicks,</HI> or his two <HI>Returnes.</HI> Betweene
which two points, he spendeth his whole time, mouing this way and that
way, in going and returning: as the Sea doth, in his ebbing and flowing. And,
when he is come vnto his period, he can go no further: but obeyeth the law
of God his Creator. As the Sea likewise doth. For the very same God, which
hath set bounds and limits vnto the Sea, and giuen it <HI>a commandement which
it cannot breake:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 38. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further, and here shalt thou
stay thy pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ud waues:</HI> hath also giuen the same commandement to the Sunne.
Which it obeyeth accordingly. Yea, and that, by so strong and inuincible a
necessity, that (as <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">laam</HI> prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ssed, in a very like case) it hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o power to trans|gresse:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 24. 13.</NOTE>
<HI>It cannot exceede the commandement of the Lord.</HI> By whose law and
commandement, it is more narrowly confined vnto a strict motion, then any
other planet is, in all the whole heauen. For, it is, as it were, imprisoned in the
<HI>Ecliptike line,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohan. de sacro Bosco. c. 2. p. 23.</NOTE> and tied fast vnto it, as with a chaine of Adamant: so that it
hath no latitude at all in the <HI>Zodiake.</HI> Now, who is it, that bindeth the Sun,
with such a necessitie, but onely God himselfe? who (as the Apostle expresse|ly
testifieth) <HI>hath both assigned the times,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act 17. 26.</NOTE> <HI>and set downe the bounds of the habi|tations
<PB N="183" REF="97">
of men.</HI> Here is plainely, <HI>Iupiter terminalis: the true setter of bounds,
and limits, vnto things:</HI> whose bounds and limits, though the Sunne it selfe
haue no power to alter; yet God, the setter of them, hath. Hee can change
and alter them, at his pleasure. As he plainely gaue good proofe: first, vnto
<HI>Ioshua;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 10. 13.</NOTE> in so holding the Sunne from mouing, that he could not go forward:
and secondly, vnto <HI>Ezechias;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Kin. 20. 11. Eccle. 48. 24.</NOTE> in so withholding, and pulling him, that hee
made him goe backward. Which manifestly sheweth, that the Sunne, in his
mouing, is not in his owne power, but vnder the command of a superior
Ruler: who turneth him, and returneth him, at his owne will and pleasure. So
that, the Sunne, of it selfe, hath not so much scope and liberty in his motion,
as many a man hath: nay, not, as any Beast hath. For they can runne, either
this way, or that way, at their pleasure: but so cannot the Sunne. Hee is mo|ued
by another; by whom hee is so tied vnto a strict and vnalterable motion,
that <HI>Astronomers</HI> can surely tell (vnto the very minute) all the <HI>Eclipses,</HI> that
shall euer fall out, so long as the world it selfe shall last. As the Romane Ora|tor
hath expressely obserued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. de Nat. Deor. p. 224.</NOTE> <HI>Defectiones Solis &amp; Lunae, praedicatae&abque; in omne
posterum tempus, quae, quantae, quand&ograve; futurae. The Eclipses of the Sunne and
Moone, are both knowne, and can be prognosticated, for all ages to come; both in
what fashion and in what quantity, and at what time, they shall happen.</HI> Now,
these praedictions could not be so infallible, but that the Sunne is tied vnto a
course vnalterable. Which notable captiuity of the Sun, more then of any
other of Gods Creatures, is excellently described, and set out by <HI>Prudentius.</HI></P>

<P>The summe and effect of which verses, is thus much.

So that, though diuers of the Heathen haue foolishly collected, from the con|stancy
of his motion; that the Sunne must be a god: Yet <HI>Prudentius</HI> (as you
see) a great deale more prudently, collecteth the contrary: Concluding, that
this argueth him rather to be a meere seruant, then a god. Yea, and so like|wise
doth <HI>Lactantius.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lact. l. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 5. p. 83</NOTE> <HI>Argum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ntum illud, quo colligunt, vniversa coelestia, Deos

they be not able to depart from their courses. Further, if they were gods, they
would moue, both this way, and that way in the heauens, as freely, as liuing crea|tures
vse to doe vpon the earth. Who, because they haue the liberty and freedome
of their will, they wander vp and downe, whither they themselues will.</HI> From
whence he there concludeth, <HI>Non est igitur astrorum motus voluntarius, sed
necessarius: quia praestitutis legibus officijs&abque; deseruiunt. The motion of the stars
is not voluntarie, but necessarie: because they be so tied vnto set lawes and offices.</HI>
Which <HI>Zacharias Mitylenensis</HI> also expressely confirmeth. For hee saith of
the Sunne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. Mitylen. l. De Mundi Cre|at. Bib. Pat. To. 5. p. 739.</NOTE> that, <HI>Habet motum voluntatis expertem, velut seruus: That his mo|tion
is involuntarie, like the motion of a seruant:</HI> which must be directed by his
masters commandement. Now, if the Sunne be but a seruant, both in his <HI>wor|king,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 19. 4. 5. Hugo de S. Vic|tore l. 7. Erudit. Didasc. c. 8 To. 3. p. 19.</NOTE> and in his <HI>mouing:</HI> who is then his Lord and Master, that setteth him
so on doing? The Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> cleeres that question. <HI>It is God that hath set
a tabernacle for the Sunne, in the Heauens, and appointed him as a Gyant, to run
his race. Quis, Solem per hiberna descendere signa praecipit?</HI> (saith <HI>Hugo de Vi|ctore)
Quis rurs&ugrave;m, per aestiva eum signa ascendere facit? Qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, eum ab oriente
in occidentem ducit? Quis iter&ugrave;m, ab occidente in Orientem reuehit? Haec cuncta
<PB N="185" REF="98">
sunt mirabilia: sed soli Deo possibilia. Who commandeth the Sunne to descend
and goe downe into the signes of the Winter, and who, to ascend backe againe in|to
the signes of the Summer? Who leadeth him along from the East into the West?
And who fetcheth him againe, from the West into the East? These workes to vs
are wonderfull: but onely to God are possible.</HI> So that the Sunne is so farre from
giuing bounds and limits vnto other things, that it selfe is the most streightly
bounded and limited of all things. And that (as before I noted) not onely in
his <HI>working,</HI> but also in his <HI>moouing.</HI> In his <HI>working:</HI> because (as <HI>Zacharias
Mitylenensis</HI> obserueth) <HI>Nihil potest vel efficere vel operari,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. Mitylen. vbi supra.</NOTE> <HI>qu&agrave;m quod consti|tutum
sit a Deo, ordinis Dictatore: He can neither doe, nor worke any thing, but
as God, the prescriber of order, hath appointed him.</HI> In his <HI>moouing:</HI> because (as
in the same place he affirmeth) <HI>Continuum faciens motum &amp; modulatum, non
excedit terminos, ab Opifice sibi impositos. Though hee bee in a continuall and
perpetuall motion; yet doth he not exceede those bounds, that are praescribed him
by that workeman that made him.</HI> So that God alone is the limiter of the Sun:
and consequently of euery other thing:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Giuing vnto all, both life, and breath,
and all things:</HI> as the Apostle plainely testifieth. And therefore God may
more properly be called the Sunne, for doing those things as the principall A|gent;
then the Sunne can be called God, for doing them none otherwise,
but onely as Gods instrument. For, those things, though instrumentally they
be wrought by the Sun; yet are they originally wrought, onely by God. And
therefore, as <HI>Boetius</HI> very wittily collecteth:
<Q><L>Quem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l. l. 5. de Con|sol. metro 2. p. 1100.</NOTE> quia respicit omnia solus,</L>

<L>Whom, for he solely euery thing doth see,</L>

But to proceede.</P>
<P>8 As it is in all the fore-named naturall powers, that they be limited and
dispensed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Arts are limited.</NOTE> according to the will and pleasure of the giuer: so is it likewise in
all artificiall faculties. There is no man, adorned and indowed with al of them.
But some man hath one, and some man another, but no man hath them all to|gether.
<Q><L>Non en&igrave;m omnia pariter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. l. 4. Iliad. p. 441.</NOTE></L>
<L>Dij hominibus dare consueuerunt:</L></Q>
saith <HI>Homer.</HI>
<Q><L>Nor all at once, nor all alike, nor euer hath it bene,</L>
<L>That God should offer, and conferre his fauours vpon men:</L></Q>
but dispenseth them by degrees, as he himselfe pleaseth. Which may as eui|dently
be seene, in his dispensing of Knowledges, of Arts, and of Sciences; as
as in any of the fore-named naturall faculties. For, though all the seuerall Arts
and Sciences in the world (which are in number infinite) haue beene deuised,
and inuented by the wit of man: yet had neuer any man so infinite a wit, as
to know and vnderstand the depth of all of them. Nay, no man of many of
them. Nay, no man of any of them. No, not of that one Art, which by him|selfe
is professed, and wherein he desireth to bee accounted excellent. All
which notwithstanding, are so limited by God, that they are not, either con|founded
or coincident: yet is our capacity so much straitlier limited, that it
cannot reach to any of their limits. Let me insist a while vpon the seuerall
<PB N="186" REF="99">
steppes of this <HI>gradation:</HI> and giue some light, by instances, in euery one of
them.</P>
<P>That no man hath the knowledge of all Arts and Sciences, but is still
limited and confined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No man hath the perfect knowledge of all Arts.</NOTE> either vnto some one, or else (at the most) but vnto
some few of them: we may euidently see, if we will take a suruey, either of
<HI>the Mechanicall,</HI> or of <HI>the liberall Arts.</HI> First for the <HI>Mechanicall,</HI> and ma|nuarie
Arts: wee see by experience, that the Plowman knoweth not, what
belongeth vnto the Ship; nor the Shipman, vnto the Plow. But, as it is in
the <HI>Poet.</HI>
<Q><L>Navita,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propert. l. 2. Eleg 1. p. 193.</NOTE> de ventis; de Tauris, narrat Arator;</L>

<L>The Plowman, talke of Oxen find's;</L>
<L>The Soldior, doth recompt his knocks;</L>
<L>The Shepheard, reckons vp his flocks.</L></Q>
Nay, euen in those inferior and ministeriall Arts, which are subiected vnto
others, as to their <HI>Architectonicals;</HI> wee see, by like experience, that all of
them are limited, within their owne precincts: and none of them acquainted
with the mysteries of others: No not, though they all depende vpon the
same head and principall. As namely, for example. The Art of the <HI>Sadler,</HI>
although it be ordayned vnto the art of the <HI>Rider;</HI> yet hath not the Sadler
any skill in Riding, but onely in making of Saddles to ride in. And so like|wise,
downward. The Rider hath not the Art of making his owne Saddle,
nor his Bridle, nor his Horse-shooe, nor his Bit: but there be seuerall Arts
belonging to all these; and yet all of them subseruing vnto the Art of Riding:
whereof all they be ignorant: as the Rider, of all these: and each of these
of others. And so it is likewise, in both our former instances. The Ship-wright,
though hee haue the art of making a ship; yet hath hee not the art
of guiding a ship: No more then the Saylor hath the art of the <HI>Ship-maker.</HI>
And the same we may likewise see, in the Plowman; which is our second in|stance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. l. 2. De Repub. p. 550.</NOTE>
<HI>Non sibi Agricola aratrum conficit, ne&abque; ligones, &amp; rastros, &amp;c. sed

<P>So that, though the Plowman haue the knowledg of the plowing of his

to the Carpenters occupation: who yet, hath not the skill and art of
plowing. Now, who is it, that thus distributeth, and limiteth these meaner,
and inferior arts vnto men? It is onely God himselfe, by the Heathens owne
confession. <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> affirmeth, that, though all those men fore-named,
be euery one ignorant of anothers art; yet that God is not ignorant of any
one of them: but hath the perfect and generall skill of them all, imparting vn|to
men, but certaine small parcels and fragments of those knowledges, and re|seruing
to himselfe, as his owne prerogatiue, to haue the full and perfect

<HI>It is the Lord that is our Strength:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 28. 7.</NOTE> as the holy Scripture also teacheth vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 59. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. vbi sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a.</NOTE> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> in the former place, goeth further, and sheweth, that those
faculties are limited, not onely vnto men; but also vnto Beasts too. As, in
dogges; some of them are onely strong in fighting, some others, in running.
And so in Horses too; some of them are onely strong in riding; some other
of them, in onely drawing. And this gift, thus limited, euen to these brute
beasts, doth God plainely assume vnto himselfe. <HI>Hast thou giuen vnto the horse
his strength?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 39. 22.</NOTE> sayth God vnto <HI>Iob:</HI> meaning, that this was not the worke of a
man, but the proper and immediate worke of God.</P>
<P>Thus God, who hath the free disposing of all excellent gifts, in his owne

vnto some of them, more, and vnto others of them, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">wer; after the onely mo|tion
of his owne goodwill and pleasure. But all of them he hath not giuen,
vnto any one man. Nay, not all, to any Nation. All nations are not eloquent.
All nations are not Warlicke. All nations are not learned. And yet, as God
hath giuen all gifts vnto none:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec Suasor. 2. p. 227.</NOTE> so hath he depriued none of all. But as <HI>Seneca</HI>

C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">tries, vnto whom God hath giuen to excell, in diuers particular gifts:
But, to excell in all, to none: much lesse to any Man. For, as <HI>Homer</HI> againe

Which sentence of <HI>Homer,</HI> implyeth these two things. First, that all these
fore-named things, are the onely gifts of God. And secondly, that hee pow|reth
them not lauishly, vpon all men, without diser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tion; but disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nseth them
aduisedly, according to his wisdome. For (as <HI>Tertullian</HI> very truely obserueth)
<HI>God is not a Lauisher,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul l. 1. cont <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. c. 24. p. 862.</NOTE> <HI>but a Dispenser of his blessings: Dispensator bonitatis,

<P>But here it may be obiected, that <HI>Elaeus Hippias</HI> had the knowledge of all
Arts. For he openly professed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic l 3. de Orat. p. 208.</NOTE> <HI>Nihil esse, in vlla arte, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">erum omnium; quod ille
nesciret. That there was nothing in any Art, of which he was ignorant,</HI> instan|cing,
not onely in liberall and ingenious Arts, but also in fordide and igno|ble:
As namely, that hee had made with his owne proper hands, both the
Cloake vpon his shoulders, and the Rings vpon his fiugers, and the Shooes
vpon his feete. Whose vaine ostentation is worthily scoffed with scomme of
the Orator,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. ibid.</NOTE> <HI>Scilicet nim&igrave;s hic quidem progressus est: He surely went a steppe or

custome it was, to call openly vpon all men, to come and oppose him in any
thing: for that hee was well prepared, to dispute of euery thing: yea and to
say all, of all matters, that could possibly be sayd of them. And so likewise
<HI>Demecri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1 de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> 137.</NOTE> who began his speech thus: <HI>Haec loquor de vniuersis. Nihil exci|pit</HI>

for the great variety of his learning. But much more is reported of the
wise King <HI>Salomon;</HI> and much more truely too&punc; whose knowledge was so
generall, that there was not almost any thing, whereof hee had not spoken.
Whereby it appeareth, that though many men haue attained but to few
arts; yet that some men haue attained vnto many. Yea almost vnto all. For
so it is reported of <HI>Democritus;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. in vit. Democriti. p. 316.</NOTE> that he was, <HI>in Philosophia <GAP DESC="foreign">: quia &amp;

man: hauing an excellent knowledge, both in the Physickes, and Ethi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">es, and
the Mathematicks; and in all the rest of the liberall Arts.</HI> But vnto this I an|swere,
with the Romane Orator:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. de Orat. p. 204.</NOTE> That a slight and perfunctorie knowledge,
may easily be attained, of many of those Arts: but a full and perfect, scarce of
any; and much lesse, of all. So that, for those men fore-named; it rather may
be thought, that they knew many Arts superficially, then any substantially.
For, if they knew so many, they knew them not all fully; much lesse knew
<PB N="190" REF="101">
they all absolutely. They knew, perhaps, more then others: but they kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">w not
so much, but they might haue learned more themselues. Their knowledge
was but such, as <HI>Simo</HI> reporteth to haue bene, in his sonne <HI>Pamphilus,</HI> that hee

<P>For first, for <HI>Elaeus Hippias,</HI> that vain-glorious <HI>Sciolus;</HI> how great his know|ledge

<P>For <HI>Leontinus Gorgias,</HI> that bombasted Sophister, the greatnesse of his lear|ning

<P>And this we may plainely see verified, euen in <HI>Tullie</HI> himselfe, to go no fur|ther

may euidently see to be true, in those strange tongues and languages, which
were by him bestowed, vpon the Apostles. For, when the Holy Ghost de|scended
vpon them, they beganne, euery one, to speake in a strange tongue:

and their vtterance, were the gifts of God: yea and limited vnto
them, in one and the same measure: but vnto some of them, in one; and vn|to
others, in another. For, the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> professeth, that <HI>hee spake with di|uer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>Yea, and the selfe same is likewise acknowledged, euen by the very Heathen.

_THe second <HI>Metaphysicall</HI> consideration, from whence we may
collect, that <HI>There is a God,</HI> is taken, from a <HI>place</HI> of a con|trary
Nature vnto the former. For, as the former concluded
it, from the limited and bounded circumscription of all finite
things; which cannot be the worke of any other Agent, but
onely of God: so this concludeth it, from the vnlimited and vnbound ex|tension
of the Appetites of Man; which can haue none other sufficient and
replenishing Obiect, but onely God. The defining and circumscribing of
all finite things, doth shew, There is a God; by whom they haue beene limi|ted.
And the dilating and extending of mans infinite appetites, doth shew
There is a God; by whom they must be filled. For an infinite appetite, can|not
be replenished, but by an infinite Obiect. So that, though the Soule of
a man, haue many diuers powers and faculties in it, which represent vnto vs,
diuers notable images of Gods diuine properties (as shall, God willing, be de|clared
in a speciall Treatise intended to that purpose:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Viz. lib. 4.</NOTE>) yet is there none of

infinite, that it cannot be filled with any finite Obiect: as the Prophet <HI>Ha|bakuk</HI>
hath expresly declared: who, in this respect, compareth it vnto <HI>Hell,</HI>

the largenesse of the appetite, should in vaine haue beene created, if there

may see an infinite auiditie: and such, as cannot be satisfied, with any finite
Obiect. Let me giue you, in euery head, some Examples, to illustrate it.</P>
<P>And first, for <HI>Naturall Appetites: Aristotle,</HI> in one place, giueth instance,
of <HI>three</HI> of them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 3. Eth. c. 11. To. 2. p. 640.</NOTE> which are, the most common, and familiar vnto all men.
And they be, the <HI>Appetites</HI> of <HI>Eating,</HI> of <HI>Drinking,</HI> and of <HI>Sleeping.</HI> And
yet, none of them all, is able to content the <HI>appetite</HI> of the soule. As King
<HI>Salomon, nominat&igrave;m,</HI> giueth instance, in all of them. For <HI>eating</HI> and <HI>drin|king;</HI>
hee expresly affirmeth of them, that <HI>though all the labour of a man,
be onely for his mouth;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 6. 7.</NOTE> <HI>yet that</HI> (for all that) <HI>the soule is not filled.</HI> Where|by
hee insinuateth, that though the Belly may be filled, both with eating
and drinking; yet the appetite of the Soule, is not filled, with either of
them. And wee see his obseruation to bee verified, euen to sense, in
the daily practice of Gluttons, and Drunkards: who lose not their appe|tites,
with the filling of their stomacks; but, euen then, when their Bel|lies
are distended, and full; yet their appetites are ieiune, and emptie; and
still desire more, euen when they haue too much: yea, and euen prouoking
their oppressed Stomackes, to eate yet more, with their sawces; and to
drinke yet more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 29. 19. Isai. 5. 11. Plaut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> in Menech. act. 1.

<L>Were quench't together, and extinct.</L></Q>
As though they had purposely beene made, for nothing, but onely, for the
actions of <HI>eating,</HI> and <HI>drinking.</HI> And therefore <HI>Aristotle</HI> very truely calleth
them: <HI>Furentes circa ventrem: Men out of their wits, with the pampering of
their bellies:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 3 Ethi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. c. 11. To. 2. p. 640 Arist. ibid. c. 10.</NOTE> giuing a notable instance, in the Glutton <HI>Polyxenus;</HI> who wish|ed,
<HI>that his necke were as long as a Cranes, to prolong his pleasure, in eating,
and drinking.</HI></P>
<P>And yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haggai. 1. 6.</NOTE> that curse of God doth continually pursue them, that <HI>though they

to the satisfying of his soule:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 13. 25.</NOTE> <HI>but the belly of the wicked euer wanteth.</HI> And so
<PB N="200" REF="106">
it is likewise, in the third of his instances: <HI>the appetite of sleeping:</HI> which is,
as vnsatiable, as any of the rest, if a man do giue himselfe vnto it: as <HI>Salomon</HI>
also obserueth in it: who, so elegantly characterizeth the drowsie-headed
<HI>Slug gards,</HI> that no Character in <HI>Theophrastus,</HI> is more graphically described.
Which he hath done, in the forme of a short Colloquie or Dialogue, by
an excellent <GAP DESC="foreign">. Wherein first, hee rowseth him vp, and calleth vnto
him, to wake him out of his slothfull and heauie sleepe. <HI>How long wilt thou
sleepe, &ocirc; Sluggard?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o. 6. 9. 10. 11.</NOTE> <HI>and when wilt thou arise out of thy sleepe?</HI> Then, he bringeth
in the Sluggard, very earnestly intreating him, that hee would not molest
him, but <HI>yet</HI> a while permit him, to haue <HI>a little further sleepe, a little longer
slumber, a little more folding of the hands together.</HI> And finally, hee plainely
threateneth him, that if hee continued in that Lethargie of his <HI>sleeping, his
pouerty would presently ouertake him, as a Traueller; and seaze vpon him, like
an armed Souldier.</HI> And yet would not all this serue the turne. Hee was so
deepely possessed with his <HI>veternus,</HI> and <HI>sleeping sicknesse,</HI> as if hee had beene
metamorphosed into a very Dormouse. So that, this drowsie humour like|wise,
is not diminished, by feeding it: but rather (like a dropsie) it is the more
increased.</P>
<P>3 And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sensible appe|tites be ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ti|able.</NOTE> as it is in naturall appetites: so is it, in sensible appetites too.
They cannot be satisfied, no more then the former. But euen, when they haue
what they would, they yet still call for more. And this also, King <HI>Salomon</HI>
illustrateth, by two direct instances; in <HI>Seeing,</HI> and in <HI>Hearing. The eye</HI> (sayth
he) <HI>is not filled with seeing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 1. 8.</NOTE> <HI>nor the eare with hearing.</HI> The Eye, I grant, may
bee wearied with seeing: but filled it cannot bee. As <HI>Musaeus</HI> expreslie
noteth:
<Q><L>Intuens defessus sum; satietatem non inveni aspiciendi.</L>
<L>My sight is wearied out with looking on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Musaeus de Herone, p. 342.</NOTE></L>
<L>And yet my selfe, satiety haue none.</L></Q>
For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 27. 20.</NOTE> as <HI>the Graue and Destruction cannot be filled, so cannot the eyes of a man
be satisfied:</HI> sayth <HI>Salomon</HI> againe, in another place. And so likewise the <HI>Eare.</HI>
It may be wearied with hearing: but yet <HI>it</HI> cannot be filled neither. As <HI>Socra|tes</HI>
likewise expresly obserueth. <HI>Aures suscipiunt voces omnes: nunquam ver&ograve;
implentur.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xenophon, l. 1. de sact. Socrat. p. 166.</NOTE> Our eares do receiue all manner of voices: and yet be there none of
them, that be able to fill them. And the like may bee sayd, of all the rest: as I
partly haue shewed before, in the <HI>Tast:</HI> and that, both in our <HI>eating,</HI> and also in
our <HI>drinking.</HI> Whereof <HI>Tully</HI> hath giuen vs a very notable instance, in the
<HI>Persian</HI> King <HI>Xerxes:</HI> who, hauing tired himselfe out, with all ancient, and

may a great deale more euidently be shewed. Them, <HI>Aristotle</HI> reduceth, vnto

bee so infinite, that all the power of the world will not bee able to content it.
As we may euidently see, in <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI> Whose appetite of Power,
was so infinitely great, that when he heard, <HI>Democritus</HI> to hold, <HI>There were

conquered one.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian l 4. var. Hist. c. 2. 9. p. 429.</NOTE> Whereby it is euident, that all the power of one world,
could not satisfie his appetite, though he might haue had it all. Nay, though
there had bene as many worlds, as <HI>Democritus</HI> dreamed of, though hee might
haue had all of them, yet would they not all haue contented him. For, as the

<P>And so it is likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ition o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Honour 1. vn|satiable.</NOTE> in the next Head of <HI>Honour.</HI> If a man doe chance, to

contained within any bounds and limits, neither of <HI>Reason,</HI> nor of <HI>Duty;</HI> no,
nor of his owne <HI>Safety.</HI> As we may see by examples, in all these seuerall heads.
For the first of them. The bounds of Reason, how grossely they oft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ntimes
transgressed by ambition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> p. 113. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> the Orator hath pointed vs, to a notable instance, in
the Heathen Philosophers. Of whom, though there were diuers so rigid, and
sterne, as to publish whole Bookes in contempt of <HI>Vaine-glor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> yet was the
taste of that Vaine-glorie so delightfull to themselues, as that in the same
bookes, they publisht their owne names. Which manifestly sheweth, that how|soeuer
they outwardly would seeme to contemne it, yet they inwardly affect|ed
it. So they affected glory in writing against <HI>Glory;</HI> and shewed themselues
vaine, euen in calling it <HI>Vaine.</HI> Which folly they would neuer haue commit|ted
so euidently against their outward profession, but that their Reason was
dazeled, and blinded by ambition.</P>
<P>And the like may be seene in the ambition of old men: who (contrary to
all reason) are as greedy of <HI>Honour,</HI> in their decrepite old age, when they must
by and by forgoe it; as they were euer in their youth, when they might long
enioy it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> l. 2. p. 124.</NOTE> For (as <HI>Thucidides</HI> well obserueth) <HI>Sola dulcedo Gloriae, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">en senescit.
The onely humour of ambition, doth neuer grow feeble, or old in any man:</HI> but
euen in those that are the oldest, and most decayed men, yet their ambition is
still young. Yea, and he reprooueth in the same place, that vsuall prouerbe, as
a very false position: that, <HI>In senecta, lucrari magis delectat, quam honore affici:
That all men, in their age, are rather delighted with gaine, then with fame; with
riches, then with honours.</HI> This he holdeth to be false. And wee may see the
truth of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut in vita Mary To. 2. p. 94.</NOTE> in old <HI>Caius Marius:</HI> whose ambition sprouted greene, when his
body was dry and withered, and in effect, halfe dead. Which manifestly shew|eth,
that though olde mens experience doe teach them many other things; yet
that this is a lesson which it can neuer teach them: <HI>To set downe a stint vnto
their owne ambition.</HI> So farre doth it transgresse all the lines and bounds of
Reason.</P>
<P>And so doth it of duty too: yea, and that in a very high degree. Whereof
<PB N="203" REF="107">
two Tragicks haue giuen vs two notable instances, in two ambitious brothers,
or rather indeed monsters, <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eocles</HI> and <HI>Polinices;</HI> who were both of them
so inflamed with the rage of ambition, and carried so violently through all the
barres of duty, iustice and vertue, that <HI>Euripides</HI> bringeth in one of them with
this execrable sentence:
<Q><L>Nam si violandum est ius,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> 387.</NOTE> Regnandi gratia,</L>
<L>Violand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">n est: alijs rebus, pictatem colas.</L>
<L>If Iustice may be violate, for any cause at all,</L>
<L>Then surely, for a Kingdomes sake, this violence may fall.</L>
<L>In all things else, keepe Piety inuiolated you shall.</L></Q>
Thereby plainely declaring, that the ambition of <HI>honour</HI> is more violent then
any other: breaking all the bonds of duty, both to iustice and piety. Which
yet in his brother, may be seene much more plainely. For him <HI>Seneca</HI> bringeth
in with another sentence, as impious as his brothers was, and a great deale
worse:

<L>All cost to get a Kingdome, is well spent.</L></Q>
Whereby it plainely appeareth, how immoderate the desire of glory and <HI>Ho|nour</HI>
is: contemning all the bonds of all the strictest duties that are betweene
either God, or Man, and vs.</P>
<P>And, as ambition leadeth men, to transgresse and violate all the bounds of
duty: so doth it oftentimes, to transgresse the bounds likewise, euen of their
owne <HI>Safety.</HI> Whereof, <HI>Homer</HI> hath left a notable example, in the ambition
of <HI>Achilles:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. l. 9. Iliad. p. 101. B.</NOTE> who, hauing the condition propounded vnto him; either of a

<HI>safety.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Horace</HI> is of opinion, that if it were yet to doe, he would doe
it againe. He would againe destroy his life, vpon hope of that foolish glorie,
which he sought for in his death:

<P>7 And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The appetites of a mans will are vnsatiable.</NOTE> as it is in matters of <HI>Reuenge;</HI> which is <HI>Aristotles</HI> second head:
so is it also, in matters of <HI>Will;</HI> which is his third head. Which will,
though it belong vnto the reasonable part of the Soule; yet doth it often|times,
so farre exceede all the lines and bounds of reason, that <HI>Aristotle</HI> per|stringeth

desire those things, that are impossible. And hee giueth this for in|stance;
That <HI>we desire to be immortall;</HI> although both God and nature hath
made vs purely mortall. Neither doth our will onely transgresse the prescript
lines of reason, in desiring of those things, which, in themselues, are vnlawfull:
but also, in desiring euen of those things, which are lawfull: when we desire
them, in vnlawfull either manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouid. l. 10. Me|tam. p. 399.</NOTE> or measure.</P>
<P>As for example, the loue of Children vnto their Parents, is both naturall
and lawfull. And yet, the loue of <HI>Mirrha</HI> vnto her Father, was wicked and
vnlawfull:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 7. Eth. c. 3. To. 2. p. 690.</NOTE> because she loued him, in an vnlawfull <HI>manner.</HI> And so was like|wise,

Whereupon, he was called <HI>Patris amator: The louer of his Father:</HI> as it
were, by a nickname. And so is it likewise, on the other side too: when the loue
of the Parents is too great vnto their Children;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 2. 29.</NOTE> as <HI>Niobe's</HI> was to hers. A vice,
which, in old <HI>Eli,</HI> euen God himselfe reproueth. <HI>Thou honourest thy Children,

<P><PB N="208" REF="110">
Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. vbi supr&agrave;.</NOTE> these excesses, in our intellectuall appetites, doth <HI>Aristotle</HI> con|demne,
for meere exuperances, and vices. So that, these intellectuall appe|tites,
are oftentimes no lesse excessiue and immoderate, then either the natu|rall,
or the sensible. Let me giue yet one instance more, of a truly intellectuall
obi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ct, exactly adequated and proportioned vnto the intellectuall appetite.
And that is <HI>Learning,</HI> and <HI>Knowledge.</HI> Vpon which, if a man do but once
set his minde, it carrieth him after it, with so infinite an appetite, that the
more he getteth of it, the more he still desireth it; and yet can neuer bee fil|led

shall haue the more hunger; and he that drinketh of her, shal haue the more thirst.</HI>
A thing, which euen the very Heathen haue likewise obserued, of <HI>Knowledge,</HI>
and <HI>Learning.</HI> That though it be, of all things the most sweete and pleasant:
yet that it cannot possiby either glut, or fill the Appetite: <HI>Nec poteris artibus

saith <HI>Philo Iudaeus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo Iudaeus l. De sacrificio Abel. p. 198.</NOTE> <HI>No master can fill the minde of his Scholler, as men doe vse
to fill a vessell with water.</HI> For there is no part of learning, that can fill the
Soule, though there be no part of it, but that greatly delighteth it. <HI>Tullie</HI> no|teth
of <HI>Philosophie:</HI> that there was in <HI>Cato, inexhausta aviditas legendi, quae sa|tiari

could not be satisfied,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. De Fin. p. 67.</NOTE> Whom therefore he calleth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutar. lib. Non posse suauiter viui secundum Epicurum. To. 2. p. 155.</NOTE> <HI>Helluonem Librorum; A

Histories doe much delight and please the mind; yet can neuer replenish that in|finite

againe affirmeth the like of <HI>Astronomy,</HI> and the motion of the Heauens:
<HI>Quorum contemplatione, nullus expleri potest animus: With the contemplation
whereof, it is vnpossible that the minde should euer bee satisfied.</HI> So that, no
part of learning (no nor all of it, together) is able to fill the minde. When a
man hath once setled his appetite vpon it.</P>
<P>Thus all the Appetites of man doe carry him headlong, beyond all the
bound both of vertue and reason. And yet, when he hath followed them, vn|till
he be tired with them, he can finde no sound contentment in any one of
them. Take King <HI>Salomon</HI> himselfe, for an example of examples, in all of them.
For so he seemeth to propose himselfe, in euery one of the fore-named instan|ces.
For he ingenously confesseth, that one while he set his minde vpon no|thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 2. 1 2 3 4 5 6</NOTE>
but on pleasure, and to passe his time merrily, in pleasance and iollity.
But he found himselfe quickly to be wearied with that, and to grow into so
great a dislike of all mirth, that he sayd vnto <HI>Laughter, Thou art madnesse.</HI> A|gaine,
another while he gaue himselfe wholly vnto <HI>Eating and Drinking.</HI> Ano|ther
while, to <HI>Building.</HI> Another while, to <HI>Planting &amp; Gardening.</HI> Then, to <HI>Wa|ter-workes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 2&punc; 7. 8. 12</NOTE>
and <HI>Fishing.</HI> Then to pompe in great <HI>House-keeping:</HI> entertaining
a huge traine of seruants, and followers. Then, another while, to priuatenesse
and heaping vp of <HI>Riches.</HI> Another while, to <HI>the study of learning and Wise|dome.</HI>
And thus was he driuen to shift and change his desire, from one thing
vnto another, finding solid content in neuer a one of them: but (after some
<PB N="209" REF="110">
small experience) great irkesomenesse in them all. So that, his poore soule
(like the Doue, which was sent out of the Arke of <HI>Noe</HI>) could finde no sure
footing vpon any one of them. Whereupon, he pronounceth of them all,
without exception, that there is nothing in them but <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Vexation.</HI>
Thus, all the appetites of man, though they be almost innumerable, yet are all
of them vnsatiable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 30. 15.</NOTE> and doe, all, with <HI>Agurs</HI> horseleech, cry nothing but <HI>Giue,
Giue.</HI> And yet, when you haue giuen them all that euer you can, they are still

yet neuer a whit the fatter, neuer a whit the fuller. So that, as S. <HI>Bernard</HI> no|teth
of all of them: <HI>Fit vt per varia, &amp; fallacia mundi oblectamenta, vagabun|dus

that the minde of man, wandring ouer the world, through diuers delightfull and
deceitfull pleasures, and spending her strength and trauell in vaine, is at last wea|ried
and wasted out, is surfeted, and yet not satisfied with them.</HI></P>
<P>8 Now, what is the end of all this long discourse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God is able to fill all our ap|petites.</NOTE> but onely that, which I
noted in the beginning of the Treatise? That seeing God hath made the ap|petite
of man, of such an infinite extent in euery branch of it, that none of all
these obiects is able to content it, which are supposed to be the most naturall
vnto it; that therefore there must needes bee some supernaturall Obiect ap|pointed
for it; which is able in euery corner to fill it: or else it must bee vnfil|led:
which were to bring a <HI>vacuum</HI> and <HI>emptinesse</HI> into the workes of God.
Which is vtterly absurde. For as God in his prouidence did neuer make any
belly so great, but that he prouided sufficient meate to fill it; yea, euen the
great belly of that great beast <HI>Behemoth;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 40. 10. 15.</NOTE> which himselfe so greatly magnifi|eth:
so likewise, in his wisedome, would he neuer haue made a mans appetite
so great, but that he hath appointed some obiect that can fill it: yea, and eue|ry
corner of it. Now, that the whole world is not able to doe. As may
bee well vnderstood, by this Hierogliphicall conceit: That <HI>the world
is of a circular forme:</HI> but the heart of a man is of a <HI>triangular.</HI> And there|fore,
as if wee should put a circle into a Triangle, we can neuer so fill it, but
that all the corners will be empty in it: so if we should put the whole world
into a mans heart; yet could it neuer fill it, nor reach into euery corner of it.
And therefore the onely obiect that is able to fill this three cornered heart,
cannot be any thing else,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Io. 3. 20.</NOTE> but onely the <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>vndiuided Trinitie.</HI> This is
an all-filling obiect, that is <HI>greater then our heart:</HI> and therefore is easily able
to fill it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 23. 5.</NOTE> and to radiate into euery corner of it. Yea, so to fill a mans appetite,
in euery chanell of it, vntill, like <HI>Dauids Cup, it euen runne ouer.</HI> For he is able
to fill all our naturall appetites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 145. 16.</NOTE> both of <HI>eating,</HI> and <HI>drinking,</HI> and <HI>sleeping,</HI> and
such like. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 127. 2.</NOTE> <HI>He openeth his hand, and filleth with his blessing, euery liuing
thing.</HI> And <HI>He</HI> it is, that <HI>giueth vnto his beloued sleepe.</HI></P>
<P>And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 81. 10.</NOTE> though the mouth of our appetite doe gape neuer so wide; yet hee
openeth his hand wider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 17. 14.</NOTE> and filleth both the <HI>mouth,</HI> and the <HI>belly, with his
hidden treasure.</HI> And so likewise, for our sensible appetites, of <HI>Hearing, See|ing,</HI>
and <HI>Tasting,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 2. 9.</NOTE> and the rest: hee can easily fill them too. For, he hath proui|ded
such excellent things for vs, as <HI>neither Eye hath seene, nor Eare hath heard,
nor yet, by the heart of man can be conceiued.</HI> He can fill all our intellectuall ap|petites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 5. 4.</NOTE>
both of <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>Treasure,</HI> and <HI>Pleasure.</HI> For he hath
<PB N="210" REF="111">
prouided for vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 5. 4.</NOTE> <HI>an incorruptible crowne of glorie.</HI> And, <HI>In his presence, is the
fulnesse of ioy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 16. 11.</NOTE> and, at his right hand, are pleasures for euer more.</HI> Thus (as the
<HI>Psalmist</HI> noteth) God can,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 36. 7. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Replere in bonis, de siderium nostrum: He can, euen
fill our d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps 10 2. 5.</NOTE> with euery good thing.</HI> And therefore, in another place, he pro|fesseth,
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal 73. 34. 71. 4.</NOTE> <HI>There is nothing in heauen that he desireth, but him; nor any thing
on earth, in comparison of him.</HI> He fixed his whole desire vpon God: because
he alone could fill the whole of it, without any diminution. As the <HI>Psalmist</HI>
againe, in another place, confesseth: <HI>I will behold thy face, in righteousnesse:
and when I awake,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 17 15.</NOTE> <HI>I shall be satisfied with thine image.</HI> God is a fantasme, that
can fill the fantasie; and an Obiect, that can still the appetite. Which, no|thing
in the world can doe, without him; no, not the whole world, nor
all that is in the world: but onely God himselfe. For, as S. <HI>Augustine</HI> truely
writeth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in Manua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> c 3 To. 9 p. 793.</NOTE> <HI>Si cuncta, quae fecit, Deus dederit, non sussicit, nisi s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">sum dederit.
Though God should giue thee all hee hath, yet would all that be n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">thing, if hee
gaue thee not himselfe.</HI> Whereupon hee professeth in another place, that
<HI>Quicquid igitur mihi vult dare Dominus meus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in. Psal. 26. To. 8. p. 141.</NOTE> <HI>auferat totum, &amp; se mihi det.
There is nothing in the world, that vnto me seemeth pleasant, but onely God.
And therefore, if God would giue vnto me, al: that euer he hath; let him take
all that away, and giue me onely himselfe.</HI> For, there is nothing else, that can
fully content vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. l. 1. Confess. cap. 1. To. 1. p. 61.</NOTE> as in his Confessions he plainly professeth: <HI>Domine, quia fecisti
nos ad te, inqutetum est cor nostrum, donec requiescat in te. O Lord</HI> (saith
hee) <HI>because thou hast purposely made vs for thy selfe, therefore our heart
can no where finde any quiet, vntill it doe come to rest in thy selfe:</HI> Not in
all the honours, not in all the riches, not in all the pleasures of the world.
As is likewise very notable obserued, by S. <HI>Bernard:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernard. Serm. De bonis de se|rendis. p. 1146.</NOTE> <HI>Ad imaginem Deifacta

habiturus. The soule of a man, being made vnto the image of
God, may be busied about many other things, but can be filled with nothing
but with him. For that, which is capable of God himselfe, cannot be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">illed with
that, which is lesse then God himselfe. Hence euery man naturally desires the

the proper place, and true Center of mans Soule, in whom it can onely
repose it selfe securely. I will lay me downe to rest, and sleepe in peace,</HI> (saith
the <HI>Psalmist) for it is the Lord onely that maketh me dwell in safetie.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 4. 8.</NOTE> Here
is the true repose, and naturall rest of the Soule, when it lodgeth vp it selfe,
vnder <HI>the shadow of Gods wings.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 17. 8. 57. 1. 61. 4. 63&punc; 7.</NOTE> And therefore, <HI>Dauid</HI> beseecheth the Lord,
<HI>that he would hide him, vnder the shadow of his wings.</HI> Professing in another

that, <HI>his trust should be, vnder the shadow of his wings.</HI> And in another
<PB N="211" REF="111">
that, <HI>he will reioyce, vnder the shadow of his wings.</HI> Thus, <HI>vnder the shadow
of Gods wings,</HI> the Soule findes her true reposednesse, her refuge, her assu|rance;
and her fulnesse of ioy: so that when she is come thither, she can de|sire
no more. For, <HI>as a Buble</HI> (saith <HI>Gregorie Nyssen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Nyssen. in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Orat. 11. p 407.</NOTE> vsing a contrary com|parison

but, by degrees, ascendeth vp, vntill it come vnto the toppe: and, when it

breaking his thinne filme, powreth forth it selfe naturally, into the open ayre:
so likewise, a mans Soule cannot content and stay it selfe in any of these earth|ly
and inferior things; but naturally ascendeth vpward, vntill it come to God:
Whither when it is once come, it then hath no desire to ascend vp any further,
but there naturally resteth; Yea, and like the Bubble, beforementioned,</HI> (with

<HEAD>CHAP. 3.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That, euery thing in Nature, hath a Cause of his Being. 2. That, nothing can
be the Cause, of his owne Being. 3. That, among the Causes, there is one first,
and supreme Cause, which is the Cause of all the rest. 4. That, this first, and
supreme Cause, is nothing else, but God.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_IN the two former Chapters, I haue vnfolded, two Metaphysi|call
considerations, from whence we may collect, <HI>That there is
a God:</HI> Namely, the limited circumscription of all definite
things; and the vnlimited dilatation of mens infinite appe|tites.
In these two next Chapters, I purpose to vnfold two
<HI>Physicall</HI> Considerations, which import the same inference. The first is, <HI>a
C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">usa,</HI> that is, <HI>from the first cause of all naturall things.</HI> The second is, <HI>a Motu,</HI>
that is, <HI>from the first Moouer of all moueable things.</HI> Both which do con|clude,
<HI>That there must needs be a God:</HI> as being indeed nothing else, but two
<HI>Philosophicall termes,</HI> in sense aequipollent vnto the very name of God, and
so oftentimes promiscuously vsed. For the first of which two heads, to wit,
<HI>The first cause of all thing;</HI> I will fashion the argument into the forme of a
<HI>Sorites;</HI> wherein we may ascend, by foure steppes, and degrees, vnto the very
presence, and intuitiue vision of God. The first of them is this, <HI>That there is
nothing in Nature, but it hath his Cause.</HI> The second, <HI>That nothing in Nature,
is the Cause of it selfe.</HI> The third, <HI>That among all the Causes, there is one su|preme
and first Cause, which is the true Cause of all the rest.</HI> The fourth, <HI>That
the first Cause of all things, is nothing else, but God.</HI> All which foure positions,
are held and maintained, by a generall consent, both of <HI>Christians,</HI> and <HI>Hea|thens,</HI>
with great confidence and assurance: yea and that, not as questionable,
or disputable problemes; but as most vndoubted, and irrefragable <HI>axioms.</HI></P>
<P>For the first of which foure points,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nothing is without a Cause. Plato in Timae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 704.</NOTE> <HI>That there is nothing in Nature, but it

is begotten of something.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Tully</HI> confirmes it, almost in the
same termes. <HI>Quicquid oritur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. 2. de Diui|nat. P. 27<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>qualecun&abque; est, causam habeat &agrave; natura, necesse est.

nothing,</HI> (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> testifieth) is a common Principle, among all the Philo|sophers.
<HI>Non en&igrave;m est, vel cogitari potest, vt sit aliquid, non per aliquid:</HI> sayth
<HI>Anselmus: It cannot be imagined, that there should be any thing, which hath
not his beginning and being, from something.</HI> For, <HI>Nullius rei, sine Causa, est
ortus:</HI> saith <HI>Plutarch: There can be no being, where there is no Cause of being.</HI>
And so likewise <HI>Tully. Nullius rei, Causa remota, reperiri potest origo. Take a|way
the Cause from any thing, and you take away the beginning of his being.</HI>
And therefore, in another place, hee peremptorily pronounceth, <HI>That nothing
can be made, without his Cause: Illud exploratum habeto, Nihil fieri posse, sine
Causa.</HI> Which, <HI>Palingenius</HI> also expressly affirmeth,

<L>Without a Cause, nor being, nor ought can haue beginning.</L></Q>
And thereupon, <HI>Tully</HI> derideth it for a grosse and a palpable absurdity, and a
paradox against the very grounds of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> to affirme that there can any
thing (without a Cause of it) be either made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de fini|bus p. 39.</NOTE> or done. <HI>Nihil turpius Physico,
qu&agrave;m fieri, sine Causa, quicquam dicere: There can be no fouler error in a na|turall
Philosopher, then to affirme this, That any thing can be done or made, with|out
a Cause.</HI> And, it is a very foule error indeed. For, to say, that any thing
is made without a Cause, is to say, it hath a being, and yet no power of being.
For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramus l. 1. Dia|lecticae, c. 3. Plato. in Ciuil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 210.</NOTE> <HI>Causa</HI> is defined to be, <HI>cuius vi, res est: A Cause is a power, whereby euery
thing hath his being.</HI> And, as <HI>Plato</HI> affirmeth directly to that purpose: <HI>Causa
est, qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> principaliter rem facit.</HI></P>
<P>So that, for the truth of this first position, that <HI>euery thing in Nature hath a
Cause of his being:</HI> you see it, to be cleerly put out of al question, by the consen|ting
testimonies of many learned men. Yea, &amp; the most of them, no way inga|ged
in our Religion; but following only the light and guidance of Reason.</P>
<P>2 And therefore, let vs now proceede vnto the second; <HI>That nothing in
nature can be the Cause of it selfe.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nothing can be the Cause of it selfe.</NOTE> Which is a position, as euidently true, as
that <HI>Nothing can be the Maker of it selfe.</HI> For (as a Christian Philosopher
hath very well collected) <HI>Quod facit, est actu; quod fit, non est actu. Non ma|gis
igitur potest aliquid facere seipsum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vallesius l. de sacra Philoso|phia c. 1. p. 31.</NOTE> <HI>qu&agrave;m simul &amp; esse, &amp; non esse. That
which maketh any thing, must needes be actually in being: that which is but in

thing to make it selfe, as it is at the same time, to haue both being, and no being.</HI>
For, if it be impossible (as <HI>Aquinas</HI> affirmeth) <HI>Vt aliquid sit simul &amp; actu, &amp;

<PB N="214" REF="113">
genius</HI> also expressely confirmes it.
<Q><L>&mdash;nil se gignit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ling&punc; in Scorp. p. 206.</NOTE> nil provenit a se:</L>
<L>Nil&abque; sui causa esse potest.&mdash;</L>
<L>Ther's nothing, that it selfe begets, or from it selfe proceedes:</L>
<L>Ther's nothing of it selfe is cause, nor ought that causelesse breeds.</L></Q>
The Reasons, wherefore nothing can be the cause of it selfe, be principally two.
The first, because, euery cause is a seuerall thing, in nature from his owne effect.
The <HI>Cause,</HI> and his <HI>Effect,</HI> are so by nature seuered, that they cannot bee con|founded.
For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. mag. Moral. c. 8. To. 2. p 962.</NOTE> <HI>Causa, &amp; cuius est Causa, aliud est,</HI> saith <HI>Aristotle. The Cause is
one thing, and that whereof it is a cause, is another.</HI> And so likewise <HI>Palingeni|us,</HI>
in the fore-alledged place.
<Q><L>&mdash;causa, necesse est,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paling&punc; vbi su|pra p. 205.</NOTE></L>
<L>Vt suo ab effectu distet, diuersa&abque; res sit,</L>
<L>Needes must the cause be differing:</L>
<L>And from th' effect a diuers thing.</L></Q>
Yea, and <HI>Plato</HI> likewise expressely confirmeth it: not resting in the bare po|sition:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Hippia maiore. p. 115.</NOTE>
but forming it into a very strong reason. <HI>Aliud, est causa. Ne&abque; en&igrave;m
causa, ipsius causae causa esse potest. Causam en&igrave;m efficientem esse constat. Ab effe|ciente
ver&ograve; effictum fit, non efficiens. Aliud autem est efficiens, aliud effectum.
Non erg&ograve; caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, ipsius causa est; sed eius, quod ab ipsa efficitur. The cause is of
one nature, and that, which is of the cause, is of another. For, the cause is not the
cause of a cause, but of an effect: because the cause is an efficient: and an effici|ent
bringeth not forth another efficient, but onely an Effect. Now, an effect is al|wayes
a thing different from his efficient. Therefore, a cause is not a cause
of a cause, but of an effect, which is made by that cause.</HI> This is the first reason,
why nothing can be the cause of it selfe: because then, it should differ from
it selfe, and should not be the same thing with it selfe.</P>
<P>The second Reason is: because <HI>the cause is alwayes before his effect.</HI>
<Q><L>Causam, causato, dicimus esse pri&ugrave;s.</L>
<L>The cause, before the caused, we do euer asseuere to be.</L></Q>
<HI>Efficiens &amp; effectum vnita quidem sunt invicem</HI> (saith <HI>Trismegistus) sic tamen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. in Pi|mand. Dial. 14. p 470.</NOTE>
<HI>vt vnum praecedat, alterum ver&ograve; sequatur: The efficient and effect are vnited
together, by a mutuall dependance one vpon another: and yet is the one of them
before the other.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. Mytilen l. de Mundi Creat. Rib. Pat. To. 5. p. 746.</NOTE> For (as <HI>Zacharias Mytilenensis</HI> obserueth) <HI>Oportet effecto|rem
antiquiorem esse effectu, &amp; opificijs Opificem: siquidem, id quod fit, secun|dum
est ab co quod efficit. The Efficient is more ancient then his owne effect; and
the Workeman, then his worke. For, whatsoeuer thing is made, must needes bee po|steriour
vnto his Maker.</HI> So likewise <HI>Palingenius:</HI>
<Q><L>Causa,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paling. in libra. 167.</NOTE> suo effectu prior est, Auth&ograve;r&abque;, opere ipso.</L>
<L>The cause doth alwayes his effect fore-goe:</L>
<L>Before the Worke, the Workeman is, we know.</L></Q>
Yea, and so <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe. <HI>Effector opificium praecurrere debet. Nihil au|tem,
scipso,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. De com|muni Animali|um motu. To. 1. p. 916.</NOTE> <HI>prius &amp; antiquius est. The Workeman must needes bee more ancient
then his Worke. But nothing can be more ancient then it selfe.</HI> And therefore
nothing can be the worke of it selfe: and consequently, nothing the cause of
it selfe. For (as <HI>Aquinas</HI> from this place very truely collecteth) <HI>Impossibile
est,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n. 1. Quaest. 2. Art. 3. p. 5.</NOTE> <HI>vt aliquid sit causa efficiens sui ipsius: quia sic esset prius seipso. It is meere|ly
<PB N="215" REF="113">
impossible, that any thing should be the cause of it selfe. For then it should bee
before it selfe.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Aristotle</HI> againe presseth the same Reason; yea, and
backeth it with another not inferior: that if any thing were the cause of it
selfe, it should not onely be before it selfe, but it should also bee superior vnto
it selfe. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l 10. De. Theo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eg. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 17.</NOTE> <HI>the cause is superior vnto his effect.</HI> Whereupon he there infer|reth,
that, <HI>Nequaquam conuenit, qu&ograve;d aliquid nuncupetur, vel sit, causa sui: vt
falsum est, qu&ograve;d aliquid Prius, qu&agrave; prius, sit posterius seipso; &amp; superans, quate|nus
tale, sit superatum. It is vtterly absurd, that any thing should bee called, or
be the cause of it owne selfe: as it is false, that any first thing, as it is first and
priour, should be posterior to it selfe, and that the excelling, in as much as such,
should be the excelled.</HI></P>
<P>So that, nothing can be the <HI>cause of it selfe:</HI> no not euen <HI>God himselfe.</HI>
who is the cause of all things. For, if hee were the cause of himselfe,
then must hee bee also the Effect of himselfe; which destroyeth his <HI>Omni|potency:</HI>
hee must bee another from himselfe; which destroyeth his <HI>Vnity,</HI>
and <HI>Immutability:</HI> he must bee after himselfe; which destroyeth his <HI>Aeter|nity:</HI>
Yea, he must be the Worke and Creature of himselfe; which destoy|eth
his <HI>Infinity.</HI> But none of all these can fall into God. For (as <HI>Hi|lary</HI>
truely noteth) <HI>Neque aliud est,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hilar. l. 6. De Trinit. p. 64.</NOTE> <HI>ne&abque; aliund&egrave;, quod Deus est. God can
neither be another from himselfe; not of any other, but himselfe.</HI> Therefore
God, though he be the cause of all other things; yet can he not be the cause
of himselfe; for the fore-named inconueniences.</P>
<P>It cannot bee denied, but that God <HI>is</HI> of himselfe: but not, as of a cause.
He is of himselfe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquin. 1. Quaest. 2. Art. 4 p. 7. 2. Art. 4 p. 7.</NOTE> because his <HI>Beeing,</HI> and <HI>Himselfe,</HI> are indeede all
one; his <HI>Essence,</HI> and his <HI>Esse,</HI> as <HI>Aquinas</HI> prooueth plainely. For, his
subsisting of himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eusel. 7. De Praeparat. c. 8. p. 115.</NOTE> is indeede, his very substance: as <HI>Eusebius</HI> proo|ueth
out of <HI>Dionysius. Non-genitus Deus, per se est: vt, ipsum non|genitum
esse, substantia sua est. The vnbegotten God subsisteth of himselfe;
and his beeing vnbegotten, is indeed his very substance.</HI> And therefore,
when <HI>Seneca</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. l. 1. c. 7. p. 19</NOTE> that, <HI>Deus ipse, se fecit:</HI> and <HI>Lactantius,</HI> that <HI>Deus
est ex seipso procreatus:</HI> their meaning is no more but this; that hee
is, <HI>ab alio nullo factus, aut procreatus. Hee is therefore sayde to bee the
Maker and begetter of himselfe; because hee had none other maker,
nor begetter but himselfe:</HI> no, nor indeede himselfe neither, but is altogether
<HI>vnbegotten.</HI> And so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lact. ibid.</NOTE> when God is called by <HI>Apollo,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">; and

neither.</P>
<P>For (as <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> truely writeth) hee is neither <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iust. Martyr. in Confut. Graecar. Respons. To. 1. p. 336.</NOTE> nor

he summeth vp all these things together, vnto the same reckoning, that I haue

<P>And the truth of this doctrine is expresly confirmed, euen by the very

<HI>Philo Iudeus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo. Iudaeus l. de Sacri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">i. Abel. p. 199.</NOTE> <HI>That which is vnmade must needs be more ancient then those
things that are made.</HI> Now, if nothing be without a <HI>Cause</HI> (as I haue proued,
in the former paragraph,) and yet nothing can bee the cause of it selfe, (as I
haue proued, in this;) then must it needes follow, that euery thing that is, hath
the Cause of his being, without it selfe: sauing onely God himselfe, who
hath no cause of his being: but is himselfe all one with his owne being:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 5 26.</NOTE> as
life it selfe is all one with its owne liuing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anselm. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> monologio. c. 5. To. 3. p. 4.</NOTE> For, <HI>God is nothing else but</HI> Life. <HI>Tu
es ipsa vita, qua viuis; &amp; Sapientia, qua sapis:</HI> saith <HI>Anselmus: Thou
art the Life it selfe; whereby thou liuest; and the Wisedome it selfe,
whereby thou knowest.</HI> And therefore, as <HI>Life</HI> is not the cause of its owne
liuing, but the very same <HI>identity</HI> with its liuing: so God is not the Cause of
his owne being, but one and the same thing with his being.</P>
<P>3 Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is a|mong the Causes but one first cause.</NOTE> if nothing can be the Cause of it selfe; then must euery thing
needes haue a cause without it selfe, which is another thing from it selfe. For,
we see by experience, that there dayly be produced, many strange and notable
effects in the world: which all of them proceed not from one and the same
cause: and yet none of them is brought forth without his cause. And there|fore,
it commeth, in this place, to be discussed; <HI>Whether, among those Causes,
there be no first Cause at all, but an endlesse proceeding and going on, in infini|tum?</HI>
or, <HI>whether, among them, there be many first Causes?</HI> or, <HI>whether, there be
but one which is Causa causarum,</HI> that is, <HI>The true Cause of all the rest, and
whereof all other Causes are but mere Effects?</HI></P>
<P>For the first of which three problemes, were may dayly see by sense, how
one Cause produceth, and begetteth another; and that, another; and that,
another: and, that euery one of these, though it bee a cause of some inferior
effect; yet is it an effect of his owne superior Cause. As for example: the
beating of the Sunne vpon the Earth, worketh in it an <HI>heate;</HI> that heate pro|duceth
many kindes of fruites out of it; those fruites beget nourishment,
both in men and beasts; that nourishment begetteth that <HI>Semen genitale,</HI>
whereby yong ones are begotten, in all their seuerall kindes: and so from
generation, to generation, continued. Now, in this connexion and <HI>series</HI> of

cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">) <HI>Hoc, nemo non putat obsurdum, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">si qui nimis est absurdus: There is no
man, but thinkes this very absurd, if himselfe be not too grossely so.</HI> And
therefore, <HI>Palingenius</HI> very truly affirmeth, that there cannot be, in <HI>Causes,</HI> an
infinite progresse.
<Q><L>&mdash;Ergo infinitus</L>
<L>In Causis processus erit?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. in Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> p. p. 206.</NOTE> Minim&egrave;, sed oportet</L>
<L>Nimir&ugrave;m esse aliquid primum: a quo maximus ordo</L>
<L>Causarum incipiat; qui a summo tendit ad imum.</L>
<L>What then, in Causes can there be an infinite processe;</L>
<L>And can no End bee found? Oh no. There can be nothing lesse.</L>
<L>But there must needs some first maine Cause of all the rest be set:</L>
<L>Which th' order great of Causes all beginning doth beget;</L>
<L>And in which, Highest, Lowest, Midst, are all together mett.</L></Q>
Thus he reiecteth this innumerability of Causes, &amp; fixeth them, at last, in some
one, that is the first. So that (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe affirmeth) <HI>Est principium
aliquod: ne&abque; sunt infinitae entium causae:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l 2. Meta|phys. c 2. To 2. p 1385.</NOTE> <HI>There is some first cause, &amp; the causes of
of things are not infinite.</HI> For if there should be, in causes, an infinite procee|ding,
and no first cause among them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquin. 1. Quaest. 2. Art. 3. p. 5.</NOTE> then (as <HI>Aquinas</HI> very wittily collecteth)
there could be no second neither, nor no third, and so none at all. For these
numerall termes of <HI>First, Second, Third,</HI> and so forward, are not onely names
of number, but also of order. So that, as nothing can be first, which hath any
thing before it: so nothing can be second, which hath not a first before it; nor
third, which hath not a second, and so on, in all the rest. From whence it
must needes follow, that, if there be no first cause, there can be no second, nor
third, and by consequence none at all. But wee see by experience, that there
be second causes; and therefore by necessitie, there must needs be a first. We
see there be inferior causes, and therefore there must needs be also some supe|rior;
and by consequence, from which they all descend, and vpon which they
all depend. For (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe affirmeth) <HI>Necesse est, quod prius est,
Causam esse eorum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. Meta|phys. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 2. To. 2. p. 1386</NOTE> <HI>quae post illud sunt. In the series of Causes, that which goes
before, is alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s the cause of all them that follow after.</HI></P>
<P>But now, commeth the second <HI>Probleme,</HI> that, If there must needs be some
supreme and first cause: <HI>Whether there be Many of them; or, Whether be but one?</HI>
That there cannot be <HI>Many Firsts,</HI> the very name of <HI>First</HI> doth necessarily
import. For, if any thing be either <HI>before</HI> that, or <HI>with</HI> that, which wee intend
to be <HI>First;</HI> then cannot it truly be called the <HI>First.</HI> If any thing be <HI>before</HI> it;
then is it not <HI>Primum,</HI> but <HI>Secundum.</HI> If any thing be <HI>with</HI> it; then it is not <HI>Pri|us,</HI>
but <HI>Simul.</HI> So that, if it be <HI>first,</HI> it can be no more but one. Besides, if
there should be <HI>many firsts;</HI> there would follow another very great inconueni|ence,
For then (as <HI>Palingenius</HI> obserueth)
<Q><L>Tunc discordabunt inter se, ac magna ciebunt</L>
<L>Praelia, tot Reges: quia Regni summa potestas</L>
<L>Non patitur plures. Sic, mundus non erit vnus,</L>

<L>So many Kings would ne're accord, but raise a grieuous broyle,</L>
<L>For supreme Power suffer's not that many rule the soyle:</L>
<L>And so the World it selfe nor one, nor beautifull should be;</L>
<L>As lacking Order: Order 'tis doth all things beautifie.</L></Q>
But, we euidently see, those things to be cleane contrary. We both see, that
there is but one world, and not many: and yet, that it is full both of order
and beauty. And therefore it cannot haue many first Causes in it: as <HI>Palinge|nius,</HI>
in another place, concludeth.
<Q><L>Quare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paling. in Libr. p. 168.</NOTE> non possunt plura esse exordia rerum,</L>

<L>As from a single vnion, who sees not;</L>

Yea, and <HI>Trismegistus,</HI> from the fore-named inconueniences, expresly con|cludeth:
<HI>Impossibile est,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. in Pi|mand. dial. 1. p. 437.</NOTE> <HI>duos aut plures esse factores: ne&abque; en&igrave;m ordo vnus pro|baretur

It is impossible, that there should be two or more Creators: for one and the

not be many and diuers first causes of Creatures. Because, vnlesse all had re|spect
and reference vnto one prime and supreme cause, all would returne into
their fist Chaos.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anselmus,</HI> our learned <HI>Primate,</HI> hath, of set purpose, disputed this point:
and proued, by strength of reason, that, among all the Causes, which are in
the world, though they be in number infinite, yet, that there can bee no moe
of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anselm. in Monologio, c. 3. To. 3. p. 2.</NOTE> but onely one <HI>First.</HI> His reason is this following. <HI>Quicquid est,
non nisi per aliquid est. Quod cum ita sit, aut est vnum, aut sunt plura, per
quae sunt cuncta quae sunt. Qu&ograve;d si sunt plura, tunc aut ipsa referun|tur
ad vnum aliquod, per quod sunt; aut eadem plura singula sunt per
se; aut ipsa per se inuicem sunt. At, si plura ipsa sunt per vnum, iam non sunt
omnia per plura, sed poti&ugrave;s per illud vnum, per quod [illa] plura sunt. Si ver&ograve;
illa plura singula sunt per se, vti&abque;, est vna aliqua vis vel natura existendi per
se, quam habent, vt per se sint. Non est autem dubium, qu&ograve;d per illud vnum sint,
per quod habent, vt sint per se Veri&ugrave;s erg&ograve;, per ipsum sunt cuncta, qu&agrave;m per plura,
quae sine illo vno esse non possunt. Vt ver&ograve; plura per se inuicem sint, nulla patitur
ratio: quoniam irrationalis cogitatio est, vt aliquares sit per illud, cui dat esse.</HI>
The whole summe of whose reason, is, in effect, thus much: <HI>Whatsoeuer thing
hath being, must needs haue it, by Something. And that thing, which giueth it
being, must needs be, either some one speciall thing asunder, or else many things
<PB N="219" REF="115">
together. If many things concurre, to giue being vnto any thing; then must
they needs be such, as that either all of them haue their being, from some one
other thing; or, that all of them haue their being, euery one of himselfe; or
that all of them haue their being, euery one from another, by a kind of inter|changeable
and mutuall power. Now, if all those many-things do themselues
receiue their being from any other One-thing; then are not all things made by
those many-things; but rather by that one-thing, which made all those many|things&punc;
Now againe, If all those many-things, haue euery one of them his being
of it selfe;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e drist. de l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eis ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cabili|bus. To. 2 p. 1595.</NOTE> <HI>then must there needs be one certaine power or Nature of Selfe-being;
by participation whereof, they all haue their being of themselues. And
then, they must needs be, all of them, only by that One-thing, by which they do all
receiue their selfe-being. Therefore, all things haue their being more truely
from that one-thing, then from those supposed many-things, which themselues do
receiue all their being from that One-thing. As for that other opinion; that
many things should mutually giue, each to other, his being; that is cleane against
all reason. For it is a senselesse imagination, that any thing should from that
receiue his owne being, vnto which it selfe hath giuen a being.</HI> A very good,
and a sound reason; though somewhat, perhaps, perplexed vnto the vulgar
vnderstanding, through the often iteration, and implexed application of the
termes, of <HI>One,</HI> and <HI>Many,</HI> and <HI>Being,</HI> and <HI>Selfe-being,</HI> so intricately wouen in|to
so many seuerall parts and branches of the sentence. But vnto those that
be learned, it is cleare enough and liquid.</P>
<P>So that, though the <HI>Series</HI> of <HI>Causes</HI> be neuer so long, yet must we needes,
at last come, by degrees, vnto some first; which is the true Cause of all the
rest: and cannot be the effect of any: because all other are of it. For, as <HI>Pa|lingenius</HI>
writeth:
<Q><L>Ens primum, causa est, &amp; non effectus: at imum</L>
<L>Effectus tant&ugrave;m debet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paling. in Scor|pio. p. 206.</NOTE> non causa, vocari.</L>
<L>Quae media existunt, his nomen adhaeret vtrum&abque;.</L>
<L>In Nature, and in order of all things in their respect,</L>
<L>The first and highest called is a Cause, and no Effect:</L>
<L>The last and lowest an Effect: but not a Cause at all.</L>
<L>But those that stand twixt first and last, thou mayst by both names call.</L></Q>
Both Causes, and Effects. Causes of their inferiors, and Effects of their supe|riors.
As in the <HI>Series</HI> of the <HI>Categories,</HI> the highest, is only a <HI>Genus,</HI> and
not a <HI>Species;</HI> the lowest, is onely a <HI>Species,</HI> and not a <HI>Genus;</HI> the subalternes,
are both, in their diuers relations; <HI>Genera,</HI> to their inferiors; and <HI>Species,</HI> to
their superiors. But the highest can bee no <HI>Species.</HI> And, no more, can the
<HI>first Cause,</HI> be the <HI>Effect</HI> of any other: because it is not vnder any forme or
higher:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 3. Meta|phys. c. 4. To. 2. p. 1393.</NOTE> but is the highest it selfe: and is <HI>Ingenitum,</HI> as <HI>Aristotle</HI> teacheth. And
therefore <HI>Trismegistus</HI> expresly affirmeth, that, <HI>Ex vno principio cuncta pen|dent.
That all things haue their being,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. Pi|mand. dial. 20. p. 426.</NOTE> <HI>and beginning, of one thing.</HI> And <HI>that,</HI>
in the same place, hee affirmeth, <HI>to be God.</HI> And this, <HI>Nyssen</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nyssen.</NOTE> affirmeth to bee
the receiued opinion of all men. <HI>Constat inter omnes, ex vna causa pendere
res omnes. It is confessed of all men, that all things depend vpon the supreme
Cause.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore <HI>Aristotle</HI> biddeth vs, that, in searching of the <HI>causes,</HI> wee
<PB N="220" REF="116">
should,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l 2. Phys. c. 3. To. 1. p. 433. Greg. l. 16. Mor. c. 18. To. 1. p. 95.</NOTE> <HI>semper exquirere summam causam: That we should neuer cease, vntill
we are come, vnto the supreme and the first cause.</HI> And so <HI>Gregory</HI> likewise, vn|to
the same purpose: <HI>In omni causa, solus ipse intuendus est, qui principaliter
est. In euery cause, he only is to be eyed, that is the principall, and principally is.</HI>
For, vpon it do all the rest depend, as <HI>Iamblicus</HI> likewise expresly teacheth. <HI>Ab
vna causa integra, tota dependet multitudo:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aeu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> l. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> Phys. c. 9 p. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Ad&abque; summam causam, plures alia
referuntur. The multitude of all inferior causes, depend vpon one intire su|preme
cause: and to that, which is the highest, are all the rest referred.</HI> Thus, the
multitude of these inferior causes doe leade vs vnto one supreme and first
Cause: which can be nothing else, but God: which is the summe and sub|stance
of the fourth, and last paragraph.</P>
<P>4 Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That first and supreme Cause, is no|thing else, but God.</NOTE> if euery thing that is, must needs haue a Cause: and, if nothing
can be the Cause of it selfe; and, if, among all the Causes, there can bee but
one first, and principall Cause; which is the true Cause of all the rest, and of
all those Effects which proceed from all of them: then must needes that first
Cause be nothing else, but God. For, what can that be, which giueth being
vnto all things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Damasc. l. 1. de Orthod fid. c. 12. p. 184.</NOTE> but onely God? whom <HI>Damascene</HI> calleth, <HI>Infinitum quod|dam
essentiae pelagus,</HI> that is, <HI>A boundlesse Ocean of pure and simple being&punc;</HI> which
out of his fulnesse, imparteth their being vnto all other things, as the Ocean
doth his waters, vnto fountaines and riuers. For, if this first Cause, which
hath giuen their being vnto all the innumerable things of this world, bee
something else, and not God: then, what hath God done? or, what hath God
to do? to whom hath God giuen any being? or, how can hee possibly be a
God, which hath giuen being vnto nothing? or, how can that bee any other
thing then God, which hath giuen their being vnto all things in the world?
Therefore, whosoeuer yeeldeth, that there is a <HI>first cause,</HI> hee must needes
yeeld, by consequence, that, that <HI>first cause is God.</HI></P>
<P>And this we may see verified, by a generall <HI>consent,</HI> both of <HI>Christians,</HI> and
<HI>Heathens.</HI> Of whom, some doe call this first Cause, by such titles and ap|pellations,
as doe necessarily insinuate, that it must needes be God. Some
collect it, by such reasons, as doe necessarily conclude it. And some, in direct
and expresse termes, affirme it. For the first of which three heads, to wit, the
titles, that are giuen to this first Cause, <HI>Palingenius</HI> (as before I shewed) cal|leth
it, <HI>Ens primum:</HI>
<Q><L>Ens primum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paling. in Scorp. p. 206.</NOTE> causa est, &amp; non Effectus.&mdash;</L>
<L>The first Ens, is a pure meere cause, it cannot an Effect be call'd.</L></Q>
Both which two titles, are the titles of God: both to bee, <HI>Ens;</HI> and to bee,
<HI>Primum.</HI> For first, for <HI>Ens. Demascene</HI> expresly affirmeth, that, of all Gods o|ther
names,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Damasc. l. 1. Or|thodox. fid. c. 12&punc; p. 184.</NOTE> the name of <HI>Ens,</HI> is most proper vnto him. <HI>Ex omnibus nominibus,
quae Deo tribuuntur, nullum aequ&egrave; proprium videtur, at&abque; Entis nomen. Of all the
names, which are attributed vnto God, there is none so proper, as is the name of
his Essence, or Being:</HI> he being named from his owne <HI>Being, I am.</HI> And for
<HI>Primum:</HI> euen <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe affirmeth, that <HI>God is, Et primum, &amp; princi|pale
principum:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 11. Me|taphys. c. 6. To. 2. p. 1409.</NOTE> <HI>both the first, and the principall principle of all things.</HI> Yea and,
euen God himselfe chalengeth both the same titles directly vnto himselfe. For
he calleth himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exo. 3. 14.</NOTE> <HI>I am:</HI> which is al one, with <HI>Ens:</HI> and he calleth himselfe, <HI>The
Ancient of dayes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 7. 9.</NOTE> which is all one, with <HI>Primus.</HI> Nay, <HI>Primus,</HI> in expresse
<PB N="221" REF="116">
termes: <HI>Primus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay 41 4.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; novissimus, Ego sum.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Aristotle</HI> further affirmeth,
this <HI>primum Ens,</HI> to be, <HI>Ipsum quid est:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 7. Meta|phys. c. 1. To. 2. p. 2433.</NOTE> which is all one, with <HI>I am:</HI> and to be,
not an <HI>Accidens,</HI> but a <HI>Substance.</HI> Now, <HI>Aristotle,</HI> in another place, giueth
to this first and <HI>supreme Cause,</HI> another title, which is as proper vnto God, as
either of the former.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 4. Meta|phys c. 1. To. 2. p. 1397.</NOTE> And that is, <HI>To haue his being of it selfe. Suprema causa,

affirmeth of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. in So|phis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a p. 188.</NOTE> <HI>Natura per se;</HI> that, <HI>Ab eo, quod ver&egrave; est, non abest, nec mo|tus,

of God:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 5 26.</NOTE> who (as the Scripture testifieth) <HI>Hath his life in himselfe.</HI>
This is proper and peculiar vnto God, to be, <HI>Natura per se.</HI> All other things
are, <HI>Natura, per aliud.</HI> There is none of all them, that haue either their <HI>liuing,</HI>
or their <HI>mouing,</HI> or their <HI>breathing,</HI> or their <HI>being,</HI> of themselues; all which
<HI>nominat&igrave;m, Plato</HI> ascribeth vnto the first Cause: but all these things they doe
onely receiue from God, as the Scripture <HI>nominat&igrave;m</HI> affirmeth of all of them.
<HI>In him they liue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 28</NOTE> <HI>and mooue, and haue their being.</HI> And <HI>he it is,</HI> that giueth vn|to

<L>And therefore they, what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er'e they haue, haue power it to lees.</L></Q>
<HI>Trismegistus</HI> giueth it another title, which is likewise the proper title of God.
For he calleth it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. Pi|mand. Dial. 10. p. 426.</NOTE> <HI>Vnum principium, ex quo cuncta dependent.</HI> And in another
place (as though hee had not yet spoken enough) he correcteth himselfe. <HI>Ex
vno cuncta pendentia, ex eo poti&ugrave;s defluent&iacute;a.</HI> Hee sayth, that there is <HI>but one
principall Cause,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Asclep. c. 8. p. 505.</NOTE> <HI>vpon which all things doe depend; or rather indeed, from
which all things do descend.</HI> Now, this can bee nothing else but God. For (as

selfe, and which giueth being vnto euery other thing, must needs be, euen in rea|son,
the highest and most principall thing that hath a being.</HI> Now, God hath
his being onely of himselfe: and hee likewise giueth being, vnto euery other
thing: for there is nothing in the world, which hath any being, but it hath it,
by participation from him. So that, nothing indeede can primarily and pro|perly
be called <HI>Ens,</HI> but onely God. Euery other thing, as it hath his depen|dence

<PB N="222" REF="117">
secondarie acceptance: as the <HI>Accidens,</HI> which hath his whole <HI>Esse</HI> in his
<HI>Substance.</HI></P>
<P>And this, euen <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe expresly confesseth. <HI>Caetera Entia dicuntur, e&ograve;

<HI>Praedicament of Substance.</HI> And so it is, betweene the first Cause, which hath
his being of it selfe; and all other things, which haue their being from it. They
be indeed, but as <HI>Accidents,</HI> in comparison of it. And their being, vnto his, is
no better then nothing:<NOTE PLACE="marg">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">. Hom. in l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">b. Reg. To. 1. p. 362.</NOTE> as is plainely and directly affirmed by <HI>Origen. Et quae

quod seipsum mouet? When as one thing is moued by another, and that still by
another, and so in infinitum; can there then be any thing, that hath a first mo|tion?
[no, surely, there cannot.] For how can that be the first moouing of all o|ther,
which it selfe is moued by another? This is a thing vnpossible. But, if wee
grant, that there is something, which is moued onely by it selfe, and not by any o|ther
thing; if that moue another th&igrave;ng, and that another, and so there bee many
things moued in their order; then, the first beginning of all those motions so mo|ued
by others, can be nothing else, but onely the Impulsion of that one first Mo|uer,
which mooueth of himselfe.</HI> Out of which discourse of <HI>Plato,</HI> wee may ga|ther
these <HI>two Aphorismes.</HI> First, that, <HI>if there should be in those motions, which
are moued by another, an infinite progresse, there could none of them be first.</HI>
Secondly, that, <HI>we must needs come, in the end, vnto some such thing, as is mo|ued

thing, which thus mooueth of it selfe, is the true cause of motion, vnto euery o|ther
thing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aristotle,</HI> in like manner, though, in many other points dissenting from his
Maister; yet, in this point of <HI>Motion,</HI> he consenteth fully with him: yea, &amp; pres|seth
the same reason, almost in the same forme. <HI>Omne quod mouetur, ab aliquo
moueri necesse est.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 8. Physic. c. 5. To. 1. p. 528.</NOTE> <HI>Et, aut ab eo quod mouetur ab alio, aut ab eo quod non mouetur

quod ab alio non mouetur, necesse est. Fieri en&igrave;m non potest, vt in infinitum profi|ciscatur
id, quod mouet, at&abque; mouetur ab alio: Quippe, c&ugrave;m infinitorum nihil sit
primum. Whatsoeuer thing is mooued, must needes be mooued of something; and
that thing which moueth it, must needes it selfe be moued, either of ano|ther,
<PB N="226" REF="119">
or not of another. If it be mooued by such a thing as is mooued of ano|ther,
we must come, by necessity, vnto a first moouer, which is not mooued by any
other. For it is vnpossible, to goe still on for euer, in those things that are
moued by another. Because, in those things that are infinite, there can none of
them be first.</HI> And therefore, where there is granted to be any first thing,
there cannot be held to be an infinite proceeding.</P>
<P>Yea and againe, a little after. <HI>Fieri non potest, vt id, quo motus affertur, mo|veat
abs&abque; eo quod movet a seipso. It cannot be, that that which is moued by an|other,
should be moued but by that which is moued by it selfe.</HI> And hee giueth
these examples. <HI>Baculus mouet lapidem, &amp; mouetur a manu, quae ab homine
mouetur. The Staffe moues the stone, the hand moues the staffe, the man moues
the hand:</HI> and the man is moued (in some sort) of himselfe. For (as the Ro|mane
Orator affirmeth) <HI>Quod animal est,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. Tusc. p. 116.</NOTE> <HI>motu mouetur interiore, &amp; suo. Euery
liuing thing is moued, by an internal motion of his owne.</HI> So that the summe of
those two fore-named Reasons, which I haue aboue set downe in their Au|thors
owne words, is (in effect) thus much. That, <HI>Whatsoeuer thing is moued
must needs be moued by something: and that thing, must either be moued by
it selfe, or by some other thing. By it selfe can no inferior or second thing
be moued, but alwayes by some former and superior. For, as it subsisteth not by
it selfe, but by another; so moueth it also, not it selfe, but by another. Motum
en&igrave;m suum non sibi debet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hilar. l. 3. De Trin. p. 31.</NOTE> <HI>sed Authori,</HI> (saith <HI>Hilarie.) It oweth all his motion,
not vnto his owne power, but to his Author and first Mouer. So that no infe|rior
thing is moued of it selfe, but onely by the power of the supreme and first
Mouer. Now, if all these sensible and inferior things be moued of some other
(as wee plainly see they are,) then may we, by them, ascend, as by steppes and
degrees, from the lower to the higher, vntill we come at last, vnto that first
Mouer. For, in those things that are moued by another, wee cannot proceede in
infinitum; but must, at last, stay in one, which is the Mouer of all the other
and yet it selfe is moued by none other, but hath both his motion, and his be|ing,
of himselfe. And therefore must needs be God.</HI> This is the whole summe
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d effect of that Argument. Whereby this first point is euidently cleered:
<HI>That the contemplation of these secondarie motions, doe leade vs, by necessitie,
vnto a first.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquin. 1. Quaest. 2. Art. 3. p. 5.</NOTE> Yea (and as <HI>Aquinas</HI> very wittily obserueth, as well in <HI>Motions</HI>
as in <HI>causes) There can be no Second, if there be no First;</HI> no inferior, if there
be no superior; no posterior, if no prior; nay, no last, if no first. And this
holdeth, not onely in these relatiue denominations, but also in the true ex|istence
of the very things themselues. So that, the motions of these inferior
Bodies, which we see, by sense, must leade vs, of necessitie, either to grant
a <HI>first Mouer:</HI> who is the Author of all the motion in the world: and
therefore must needs be God: or else, to yeeld, in motion, an infinite pro|ceeding:
which is absurd, euen to Reason, and vtterly destroyeth all order
in things: or else, to hold, that <HI>There is no motion at all;</HI> as <HI>Melissus</HI> did,
<HI>Motum non esse, sed videri esse:</HI> Which is the greatest absurditie of all.
An absurditie so grosse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">La&euml;rt. in vita Melissi, p. 312.</NOTE> as is confuted, euen by sense. As <HI>Diogenes</HI> very wit|tily
proued, against a Philosopher, maintayning that error, that <HI>There was
no motion.</HI> Behind whom he slily comming, whipt him sodainely about
the Legges. And then, whilest hee was running, he scornefully asked him,
<PB N="227" REF="119">
Whether now hee thought there were any motion? Not esteeming him
worthy to be confuted by reason, but onely to be derided by that sensible
demonstration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioseph. l. 2. Cont. Apion p. 902.</NOTE> For (as <HI>Iosephus</HI> very well obserueth to this purpose) <HI>Insen

<HI>Diogen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> did: <HI>The best kinde of arguing with mad men, is, with a word and a
blow; not with reason, but with stripes.</HI> And yet, euen this grosse absurditie
would follow, vnlesse, from these secondarie motions, wee should arise vnto
some first. For, <HI>Si primum nihil est, omnin&ograve; causa nulla est,</HI> saith <HI>Aristotle, If
there be no first cause,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2 Meta|phys. c. 2. To. 2. p. 1386.</NOTE> <HI>there can be no cause at all.</HI> And so, If there be no first mo|tion,
there can be no motion. Which, sense sheweth to be false. And if there
be any second motion, there must needs be a first. This, Reason sheweth to
be true.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. ibid.</NOTE> And therefore, for this first point, I conclude it with <HI>Aristotle,</HI> that, <HI>Si
media sunt, necesse est finem esse. If there be any meane motion, there must needs
be an end of them.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l 3 Meta. c. 4. To. 2 p. 1393.</NOTE> And if an end, then a beginning. <HI>Ne&abque; en&igrave;m infinitus est
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">quis motus, sed cuius&abque; finis:</HI> saith he, in another place: <HI>There is no motion
so infinite, but, in the end, it hath an end;</HI> and consequently, a beginning. For,

<L>This is a Rule, That euery End, On some Beginning must depend.</L></Q></P>
<P>2 Let vs therefore now ascend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is a first Mouer.</NOTE> from the first step, vnto the second; that, <HI>If
there be any first motion, then must there needs be a first Mouer, which moueth
onely of himselfe, and not by any other.</HI> For, in euery motion there bee
three things to be considered: <HI>The Mouer, The Motion,</HI> and <HI>The thing mo|ued:</HI>
And these three things are neuer confounded, though they euer be con|ioyned.
But, as the <HI>Motion</HI> is one thing, and the <HI>Moued</HI> another; so is it
likewise betweene the <HI>Moued,</HI> and the <HI>Mouer.</HI> For (as <HI>Picus Mirandula</HI> ob|serueth,
very truely) <HI>In quolibet moto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohan. Pic. Mi|rand in Conclu|si inibus su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s, To. To. 1. p. 58.</NOTE> <HI>Motor est alius are mobili. In euery
motion, the Mouer is distinguished from the thing that is moued.</HI> Yea, and
<HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe, vnto the same purpose. <HI>Quod mouet, &amp; quod mouetur, di|uisum

<P>But yet, though these three be ioyned all together; yet is the <HI>Mouer,</HI> in or|der,
before either of the other, euen by the law of <HI>Nature.</HI> The <HI>Motion</HI> can|not

<HI>motion,</HI> argue his <HI>Mouer:</HI> and consequently the first <HI>motion,</HI> his first <HI>Mo|uer:</HI>
Whom, though we doe not see with the Eyes of the body; yet may we
easily collect by Reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l 2 de. Nat. Deor. p. 215.</NOTE> the Eye of the minde. To illustrate this point, by
that familiar comparison, which the Orator pointeth at, in explication of
this Reason. We see, by experience, in a Clocke (which is, as at were, an
<PB N="228" REF="120">
Artificiall Heauen, measuring out vnto vs the diuisions of time) that euery
Wheele is moued euery one of them by another, vntill at last we be brought
vnto the waight it selfe, which moues them all together. Whither when
we be come, we can proceede no further by sense; and therefore, must col|lect
the rest by reason. Now, Reason plainely teacheth vs, that though the
waight doe moue all the wheeles of it selfe; yet that it could not tie it selfe
vnto the line: but that, that must needs be done, by some other thing. And
that therefore, there must needs haue beene some Author, and contriuer of
that cunning peece of worke: who first conceiued in himselfe, by a mentall
<HI>Idea,</HI> the whole reason and conueiance of all these seuerall motions; and
then accordingly disposed all the wheeles, and waights, into their seuerall
places. So that, the motion of the wheeles, in euery Clock, doth manifestly
tell vs, that there must needs haue beene an Author of that curious worke:
whose artificiall workemanship and contriuing, is that, which hath giuen,
vnto all those wheeles, their motion. And, as it is in a Clocke (which I
called before an Artificiall Heauen, because it measureth vnto vs the diuisi|ons
of time) so is it also in the Heauens themselues: which may as fitly be
called a naturall Clock, for their measuring, by their motions, the distincti|on
of time. We see, by experience, in them, that all these inferior and elemen|tarie
Bodies, doe receiue their motions from the Heauens, their superiors:
and so likewise, euen in the Heauens themselues, that the lower is still mo|ued
by his next higher, vntill wee come, by degrees, vnto the highest of all,
called <HI>Primum mobile;</HI> that is, <HI>the first moueable body,</HI> which moueth all the
rest. Now, when wee are come thither, sense can leade vs no further. But
yet Reason can. For then, we must collect, that as the wheeles in a Clock
could not set themselues on mouing; but that this must needs be the worke
of their <HI>Maker:</HI> so likewise the Heauens, though they moue without all
ceasing; yet haue not taken vnto themselues their motion, but haue had it
giuen them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. de Ge|nerat. c. 10. To. 1. p. 676.</NOTE> by their <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Mouer.</HI> For, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> truely teacheth,
<HI>Si motio cietur, necesse est, praeesse motorem aliquem: Wheresoeuer there is
motion, there must needes haue beene some Mouer before,</HI> and some Modera|tor
and guider of that motion, from whom, at the first, it receiued his be|ginning.
So that, <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> doth necessarily imply, that there is a <HI>Pri|mus
Motor;</HI> which must needs be God: be hee who, or what soeuer. For,
<HI>Quodnam erit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazian. Orat. 2. de T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eol. p. 28.</NOTE> <HI>obsecro,</HI> (saith <HI>Nazianzene) a quo vniuersum hoc mouebitur?

What, I pray you, is that which doth moue the whole world? What is that, which
moueth</HI> it? <HI>And what againe that, which moueth it? and so in infinitum?</HI> Euen
<HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe resolueth that Quaestion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 8. Phys. c. 5. To. 1. p. 529.</NOTE> that <HI>Omne quod mouetur, a supe|riore
mouetur: Whatsoeuer thing is moued, is moued by some superior Mouer.</HI>
From whence it must needs follow, that euen <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> it selfe, which
the Orator calleth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. De. Nat. Deor. p. 215.</NOTE> <HI>Extremam oram, &amp; determinationem mundi,</HI> that is; <HI>The
furthest coast, and frontier of the world:</HI> though it be, among the Heauens,
the highest of all other, yea, and that, which moueth them all together; yet
hath it, aboue it, a superior mouer, by whom it selfe is moued: Which can
be nothing else, but God. And thus, the <HI>first Mouer</HI> may necessarily be ga|thered
out of the first motion, euen by consequence of Reason. Yea, and
<PB N="229" REF="120">
so it is likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 8. Phys. c. 5. To. 1 p. 528.</NOTE> euen by <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe. <HI>Si quid ab eo mouetur, quod ab alio
motucietur, mouens aliquod esse primum, quod ab alio non mouetur, necesse est.
If anything bee moued, by that which is moued of another, it will bring vs,
at the last, vnto a first Moouer, which mooueth onely of it selfe, and not by
any other</HI></P>
<P>3 Let vs now come to the third steppe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Mo|uer is the first Cause of all Motion.</NOTE> that, <HI>If there be a first Mouer;</HI>
as hath formerly beene proued; and, if hee haue the fountaine of all true mo|tion
in himselfe; as is generally confessed; that then, hee must needes be the
<HI>first Cause of motion, vnto euery other thing.</HI> And this is likewise testified, by
the principall Philosophers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato l. 10. de Legib p. 874.</NOTE> with an vniforme consent. <HI>Plato</HI> saith directly,
that, <HI>Initium omnium motionum, primum&abque; motum, illum, fateri necesse est, quo
quid seipsum mouet. Et, hanc esse antiquissimam omnium, potentissimam&abque;
motionem. We must needes confesse, that the very first motion and beginning of
all motions, is onely that motion, whereby a thing moueth it selfe. This is both
the most ancient, and the most potent motion.</HI> Now, there is nothing in the
world, that moueth of it selfe, but onely God himselfe. No not, euen the
soule of any liuing thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. de Ani|ma. c. 1. To. 1. p. 799.</NOTE> if wee will properly speake. For, though it bee de|fined
to be, <HI>Actus primus corporis naturalis,</HI> that is, <HI>the very first act of a na|turall
Body:</HI> yet must that bee vnderstood, but onely of his owne body: yea,
and that onely, but in respect of our sense. That is therefore sayd to bee,
<HI>Actus primus;</HI> because there is not euident any sensible <HI>mouer</HI> of it, as there is
in bodies: but in respect of this inuisible <HI>first Mouer</HI> (which is its Author
and Creator) it is but <HI>Actus secundarius.</HI> Not a thing that is mooued by his
owne proper power, but onely by a power receiued from another, namely
from this <HI>first Mouer,</HI> who is <HI>Actus pr&igrave;mus</HI> indeed, and in whom the Soule
hath onely both his <HI>Liuing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 28.</NOTE> <HI>Mouing,</HI> and <HI>Being.</HI> And so is it likewise in euery
other thing. There is no motion in any thing, but it floweth from this <HI>first
Mouer,</HI> as from his first fountaine: as <HI>Tully</HI> affirmeth in expresse and plaine
termes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. Tusc. p. 116.</NOTE> <HI>Quod seipsum mouet, caeteris quae mouentur fons est, &amp; principium mo|uendi:
That which mooueth of it selfe, is the fountaine of motion vnto all other

<P>So <HI>Aristotle</HI> likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> com|muni Animal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. To. 1. p. 912.</NOTE> almost in the same words. <HI>Id, principium aliarum

is nothing can be moued, but only by that, which is moued by it selfe:</HI> meaning,
as by <HI>the first Cause:</HI> though not, as by the <HI>Next.</HI> And againe, in an other
place, he giueth direct instance, that, <HI>In Medijs,</HI> that is, <HI>in second and subalter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
motions; that which is inferior, is alwayes mooued by his next superior; and
that,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. Meta|phys. c. 2. To. 2. p. 1386.</NOTE> <HI>by his next; and that therefore all the rest must be moued by the first, from
the highest vnto the lowest. Mediorum, quorum, extra, aliquid primum &amp; vlti|mum

those middle motions, which haue any first, the former is alwayes the Cause of
the latter:</HI> and so by consequent, <HI>The first, of all the rest.</HI> And this, in another
place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. de Mun|do. To. 2. p. 1567.</NOTE> hee directly affirmeth to be God. <HI>Natura diuina, de simplici quodam

For, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> well obserueth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de Pythiae Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ulis. To. 3. Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 493.</NOTE> to this purpose: though, <HI>Quae&abque; res suo mouetur

Mouer.</HI></P>
<P>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d that wee should not thinke, that there can be in motions a perpetual
ascent, which can neuer finde an end; that <HI>Aristotle</HI> reiecteth, as an absurd
conceit. <HI>Non est enim generatio to infinita sursum vers&ugrave;s.</HI> And so not <HI>Motio</HI> nei|ther.
But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist 2. Meta|phys c. 2. To. 2. p. 1386.</NOTE> as in another place hee directly affirmeth, Wee must needs, at
the last, ascend vp vnto some first. <HI>Non in infinitum hoc proficiscitur, sed
stabit tandem alicubi; at&abque; er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t quidpiam, quod prim&ograve; Causa erit vt omnia mo|ueantur.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 7. Phys. c. 1. To. 1. p. 511.</NOTE> <HI>We cannot proceede vnto infinitie in Motion: but wee must stay our
selues at last, and come vnto some one thing, which is the first Cause of the moti|on
of all things.</HI> And this (as in another place hee affirmeth) is not onely his
owne particular opinion, dissenting, vpon sigularitie, from others; but the
generall <HI>Tenet,</HI> of all the Philosophers. <HI>Consid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rare oportet, vtr&ugrave;m sit causa
motus &amp; principium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 8. Phys. c. 1. To. 1. p. 530.</NOTE> id, quod motu seipsum ciet; an id, quod ab alio <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gitatur?
Illud, omnes vt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&abque; ponent. He moueth the question, <HI>Whether of the twaine is
the beginning of motion? That, which moueth of his owne power; or, That,
which is moued of another?</HI> And he resolueth it, that, <HI>All men doe agree vpon
the former.</HI></P>
<P>So that, by the generall Consent of all men, it appeareth, that the first begin|ning
of all motion, must be by some such Mouer, as is not moued by any
other: but hath all the power of motion shut vp in his owne power. And that
therefore, <HI>this First mouer must needs be God,</HI> and none other. Which is the
forth steppe of this Chapter.</P>
<P>4 For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Mo|uer is God.</NOTE> if these secondarie and lower motions doe leade vs vp vnto a higher:
and those vnto an higher, vntill at last wee ascend vnto some <HI>highest Mouer;</HI>
which is the <HI>Cause</HI> of motion vnto all the lower: then, what can this <HI>highest
Mouer</HI> be else, which moueth all other things, but onely <HI>God</HI> himselfe? This
<HI>Tullie,</HI> in plaine and expresse termes, affirmeth: where he putteth both those
properties, which before I haue named, into the very definition of God; that
he is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. Tusc p. 116.</NOTE> both <HI>Omnia mouens,</HI> and <HI>Ipse praeditus motu sempiterno. Hee is both the
Author of motion vnto all other things, and the Cause of motion in himselfe.</HI>
Both these hee affirmeth to be the properties of God. And so <HI>Aristotle</HI> affir|meth,
that <HI>Locall</HI> motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 12 Meta|phys. c. 8. To. 2. p 15&punc; 5.</NOTE> in what body soeuer, doth onely proceed from
some diuine Power. <HI>Si nam&abque; Latio Lationis Causa erit, illam quo&abque; oportebit
aliorum gratia esse. Quare, c&ugrave;m non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">it processus in infinitum, finis omnis La|tionis,
erit diuinorum corporum aliquod, quae in Coelo feruntur. If one Local
motion should be the cause of another; then it also should be caused and be from
others, and for others sake. Wherefore, seeing there is no infinite progresse in
things moueable; the end of all Lation (or Local motion) must be some one of
those heauenly Bodies, which are carried about.</HI> Yea, and that wee should not
thinke, that, by those <HI>Diuine Bodies,</HI> he meaneth any of the <HI>Starres:</HI> in another
place he affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 12. Me|taphys. c. 10. To. 2. p. 1508.</NOTE> that this <HI>first and supreme Mouer,</HI> is a thing, aboue all
sense; whereas all the Sarres are sensible. For, <HI>si non erunt alia, praeter sensibi|lia</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="121">
(saith he) <HI>non erit principium, nec ordo, nec generatio; sed semper principij
principium: If there should be no other then sensible things; then should
there be no beginning, nor order, nor generation of things: but alwayes a Prin|ciple
to euery Principle.</HI> Whereby hee infinuateth, that the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>supreme
Mouer,</HI> is not of a sensible, but of a diuine, and a spirituall Nature. Yea, and
<HI>Tully</HI> expresly affirmeth; that it is God, which giueth motion, euen vnto the
very Heauens. <HI>Dedit autem Diuinis, duo genera motus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. de Vniuers. p. 431.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c. He hath giuen to the

place, compareth God vnto those <HI>Players with Puppets,</HI> that by the pul|ling
of one string, can set the whole Engine, and euery part of it, on mouing.
Which <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> plainely acknowledgeth, when hee maketh his <HI>Mens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 8. Phys. c. 5. To. 1. p. 529.</NOTE> to
be <HI>Principium motus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. pi|mand. Dial. 1. p. 369.</NOTE> by which word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert, in vita Zenonis p. 253.</NOTE> hee meaneth nothing else but God.
<HI>Mens en&iacute;m est Deus:</HI> saith <HI>Trismegistus. God, which is Mens, is the beginning of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> motion.</HI> And, as <HI>Zeno</HI> likewise expresly affirmeth, this title of <HI>Mens,</HI> is but
the Philosophers name and appellation of God. <HI>Deum vnum esse, ips&uacute;mque
Mentem appellari. There is but one God, and he is called Mens.</HI> So that, when
<HI>Anaxagoras</HI> called this <HI>first Mouer, Mens;</HI> his meaning, by <HI>Mens,</HI> is nothing
else, but <HI>Deus.</HI> And, that wee impose not a forced sense, vpon that word, by
other mens expositions; the same may bee gathered, euen out of his owne
writings: and that, by two substantiall reasons. First, by those titles and ap|pellations,
which hee bestoweth vpon it: and then, by those workes, which
hee ascribeth vnto it. Both which, are peculiar and proper vnto God. The
titles, which hee bestoweth vpon his <HI>mens,</HI> be these <HI>Mentem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. De Anima. c. 2. To. 1. p. 787.</NOTE> <HI>esse Principium

esse sinceram&abque;. At&abque; eidem Principio haec vtra&abque; conuenire, Cognitionem,
&amp; motum; Vniuersum&abque; mentem hanc mouisse. This mens</HI> (saith hee) <HI>was the
first Beginning of all things, being it selfe most simple, and without any mix|ture,
most pure, and most sincere. And hauing, in it selfe, the true and reall pos|session,
not onely of knowledge, but also of motion: yea, and that all the whole
world is moued by this minde, and by this Spirit.</HI> Now, these bee the peculiar
properties of God: <HI>in whom</HI> (as the Apostle testifieth) <HI>are all the treasures
both of knowledge, and Wisedome.</HI> Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 2. 3.</NOTE> and of <HI>motion</HI> too: for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 28.</NOTE> <HI>in him we both
liue, and moue, and haue our being.</HI> So that, by this <HI>description,</HI> his <HI>mens</HI> must
needes be God. Yea and so is it likewise, by his <HI>ascription</HI> too. For hee as|cribeth
vnto this <HI>mens,</HI> the very making of the world: which is the worke of
none other, but onely of God. <HI>C&ugrave;m omnia simul essent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 8. Phys. c. 1. p. 519.</NOTE> at&abque; infinito tempore
quiscerent; mens mouit, ac segregauit. When as all things had lyen quiet, for an
infinite space together, it was mens that first moued and ordered them asun|der:
alluding vnto that confused <HI>Chaos,</HI> wherein, as the Poet speaketh, there
were,
<Q><L>Non ben&egrave; iunctarum discordia semina rerum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouid, l. 1. Me|tam. p. 1.</NOTE></L>
<L>There disagreeing seeds were clearely seene,</L>
<L>Of things which had not well conioyned bene.</L></Q>
Now, this was the proper worke of God. Yea, and this was the proper <HI>Spi|rit
of God,</HI> that did it: as euen <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in plaine and expresse words, recor|deth
it. <HI>Anaxagoras dixit, initio constitisse corpora, Dei autem mentem ea
digessisse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 1. de Pla|citis c. 7. To. 2. Mor. p. 15.</NOTE> <HI>at&abque; omnium rerum ortus effecisse; Anaxagoras sayd, that there were

This <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, the Primus motor,</HI> which first gaue things their being, and reduced

of God:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 8. 27. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> who (as it is also testified in the holy Scripture) <HI>when hee prepared
the heauens, was ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, and when he set the compasse vpon the deep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> Yea, and
this was not the singular opinion of onely <HI>Anaxagoras;</HI> but the common o|pinion
of the most of the Philosophers. Yea, and of the Poets, too. <HI>Virgil</HI>
sayth in expresse termes, that the <HI>first mouer</HI> of the world, was onely this
<HI>Mens:</HI>
<Q>Mens agitat molem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virgil. l. 6. Aen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">d. p. 267.</NOTE> &amp; magno se corpore miscet.</Q>
Yea, and that wee should vnderstand, that vnder the name of <HI>mens,</HI> hee vn|derstandeth
nothing, but the <HI>Creator</HI> of the world, hee addeth in the next
words:
<Q><L>Ind&egrave; hom&igrave;num, pecud&uacute;m&abque; genus, vitae&abque; volantum.</L>
<L>That massy Chaos bodies huge was moued by this <HI>Mens.</HI></L>
<L>And men, Beasts, Birds, and Creatures all forthwith proceeded thence.</L></Q>
All which workes, in another place, hee expresly attributeth vnto God, vnder
his owne expresse name. <HI>He is the mouer of the World, he is the maker, both of
men, and beasts, and birds.</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Deum nam&abque; ire per omnes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virgil. l. 4. Georg. p. 94.</NOTE></L>

<L>God walketh through the World, in euery Coast,</L>
<L>And goes the winding Seas Tract vttermost:</L>
<L>Yea, and the most high Heau'ns. From him, all liuing</L>
<L>Both men, and Beasts receiue their life, and being.</L></Q>
Thus, that which before hee shadowed, vnder the name of <HI>mens,</HI> hee plainely
now expresseth, vnder the name of God: making him the first <HI>mouer,</HI> and
Creator of the world. And so likewise doth <HI>Plato.</HI> For hee saith, that there
is a certaine <HI>Anima,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato, l. 10. de Leg. p. 875.</NOTE> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> which doth, <HI>in omnibus, quae mouentur, habitare,
&amp; coelum &amp; cuncta gubernare: which dwelleth in all things, that haue any mo|tion,
and which gou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">neth both heauen, &amp; euery other thing.</HI> So that, though
hee alter <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> his terme; yet hee meanes the selfe same thing. For,
as <HI>Parmenides</HI> affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laert, in vita Parmenidis, p. 311.</NOTE> <HI>Anima &amp; mens idem sunt: Though they differ in
name, yet are they one, and the same thing.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Plato,</HI> in the same place, af|firmeth
this <HI>Anima,</HI> which is the <HI>mouer</HI> of all things, to be God, and nothing
else. <HI>Deumesse, omnes arbitramur. We all suppose, There is a God.</HI> And so
likewise doth <HI>Theophrastus:</HI> who denieth, euen <HI>Nature</HI> it selfe to bee the first
mouer, euen of naturall bodies: ascending vp higher, and ascribing all their
motion vnto a superior and more diuine power.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theophra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">i, in Metaph. c. 1. Apud Aristot. To. 2. p. 1539.</NOTE> <HI>Hoc, alij cuidam meliori ac

and a superior power.</HI> Now, what is there either better, or superior to Na|ture,
but onely the God of <HI>Nature?</HI> Yea, and a little before, hee expresly affir|meth,
that this first <HI>mouer,</HI> and <HI>Beginner,</HI> is indeede nothing else, but the very
God of Nature. <HI>Diuinum omnium principium existit, per quod &amp; sunt, &amp;
permanent vniuersa: That first Beginner, from whence all things haue both
<PB N="233" REF="122">
their consisting, and existing, is a diuine power and Nature.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude this whole Chapter. All those Arguments, which <HI>Tullie</HI>
bringeth, to proue the <HI>Soule to be immortall,</HI> are much more concludent, to
proue God to be <HI>aeternal,</HI> whose <HI>Motion</HI> is both <HI>of himselfe</HI> and <HI>perpetuall.</HI>
For, there he plainely telleth vs, that there is a certaine thing, which moueth
only of it selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. Tosc. p. 116.</NOTE> and yet giueth motion vnto all other things. <HI>Quod caeteris fons
est, &amp; principium movendi.</HI> And therefore is, both without all <HI>beginning;
quia, Principij nulla est origo: Of a Principle there is no Originall:</HI> and with|out
<HI>all ending; quia, Quod seipsum mouet, quontam nunqu&agrave;m deseritur a

it neuer deserteth it selfe. it neuer desisteth to be moued:</HI> and consequently must
needs be aeternall. For, <HI>Quod seipsum movet, aeternum est. That which moueth
it selfe (and is mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d of no other) is aeternal:</HI> Now, none of all these proper|ties,
which here hee setteth downe doe agree vnto the soule, but onely in
some comparison. For, the Soule hath neither his motion of it selfe, nor yet
giueth motion vnto all other things, nor is <HI>aeternal</HI> or without all begin|ning.
This is proper and peculiar vnto God himselfe alone, whose title is,
<HI>The aeternall.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 21. 33.</NOTE> As for the Soule, though it may be called <HI>Immortall;</HI> yet can
it not, <HI>aeternall. Immortall</HI> it is, because it hath no ende: but <HI>aeternall</HI> it is
not, because it had a beginning. But God is truely the mouer of himselfe,
and the giuer of motion vnto all other things. He is truely <HI>aeternall,</HI> both
without all beginning, and without all ending, as one that hath all his be|ing
onely of himselfe: and therefore can neuer cease to be, because he cannot
forsake himselfe.

vnproperly, vnto the <HI>Soule;</HI> may, most truely and properly, be applyed, vnto
God: That hee, both hath all his motion of himselfe, and giueth all motion

is truely aeternall from all <HI>euerlasting:</HI> being not onely <HI>The first Mouer,</HI> but the

<P>So that; to recapitulate the summe of this whole Chapter; If these se|cond

which is the very fountaine of motion in all other: then must needs this
<HI>First Mouer,</HI> be God himselfe, &amp; none other. But, the first of these three points
hath beene sufficiently proued, in the first three Sections of this Chapter.
And therefore, the Conclusion followeth necessarily from them; <HI>That this
first Mouer must be God,</HI> as we haue seene in this fourth. Yea, and that (be|side
the force of the consequence) by diuers direct Testimonies, both of
<HI>Heathens,</HI> and <HI>Christians.</HI> Which is the second Consideration, borrowed
from the <HI>Physicks,</HI> whereby it may be proued, <HI>That there is a God.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP 5.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the true cause of Sicknesse, is Sinne against God. 2. That God, for
this cause, doth threaten, to sende Sicknesse. 3. That hee sendeth it ac|cording
to his threatening. 4. That Phisitions obserue the stroke of Gods
Vengeance, to be in many Sicknesses.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_I Haue hitherto vnfolded certaine Considerations, from whence
we may collect, that <HI>There is a God: first,</HI> out of the <HI>Meta|physicks;</HI>
and <HI>then,</HI> out of the <HI>Physicks.</HI> Let vs now come vnto
<HI>Physick.</HI> For, <HI>Vby desinit Philosophus, ibi incipit Medicus. Where
the Philosopher endeth, there the Physitian entreth.</HI> And there|fore,
let vs propound some Considerations, out of it. For, it hath many in
it. But in this, as in the former, I will insist, but vpon two: letting passe
all the other: that is, vpon <HI>Diseases;</HI> and, vpon their <HI>Remedies.</HI> Both which
are acknowledged, to be the proper and peculiar workes of God, almost by
the generall confession of all men, both <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Heathens.</HI> For our
better, and more orderly proceeding wherein, I will reduce this first discourse
as concerning <HI>Diseases,</HI> vnto these foure heads. First, that they both con|fesse,
the first and originall cause of <HI>sicknesse,</HI> to be onely mens sinnes. Se|condly,
that God, for this cause, hath oftentimes threatened to punish men,
with <HI>sicknesse.</HI> Thirdly, that accordingly, he hath sent diuers kindes of grie|uous
<HI>sicknesses,</HI> vnto many. And fourthly, that euen Physitians themselues
doe finde in many sicknesses, that they be diuine punishments.</P>
<P>For the first of which foure Heads: <HI>What is the true Originall cause of sick|nesse:</HI>
S. <HI>Chrysostome</HI> telleth vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrysost. Serm. 10 in Rom. To. 4. p. 100.</NOTE> that it is the part of euery good Physition;
<HI>inquirere semper in morborum radic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m, t&abque; ita pervenire ad ipsum mali fon|tem:
to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">arch into the roote of diseases and sicknesses, and so to proceede vnto
the fountaine of those euils.</HI> And S. <HI>Basil</HI> hee telleth vs, that it is the part of
a discreet and wise patient, not to leaue this inquisition only to the Physition,
but he himselfe also to search into <HI>a</HI> the causes of his owne diseases, that so he
may the better attaine to know their remedies. <HI>Nos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil&punc; Asceti|cis. To. 2. p. 292.</NOTE> <HI>plagas a Deo suscipien|tes,
qui ben&egrave; &amp; prudenter vitam nostram moderatur; principio quidem inqui|ramus
<PB N="235" REF="123">
cognitionem rationis, ob quam nos flagellet. Whensoeuer we are scourged
and chastised by God who guideth our whole life by his wisedome and goodnesse,
we ought first to search carefully, for what cause hee so correcteth vs.</HI> For, the
cause being once found, the Remedie is halfe found, and the cure, in a man|ner,
alreadie halfe performed. <HI>Medici,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. Tasc. p. 142.</NOTE> <HI>causa morbi invent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, curationem esse

thinke they haue found the cure.</HI></P>
<P>Now, for the true cause of diseases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sinne is the first cause of Sicknesse.</NOTE> and Sicknesses;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 5. de Pla|citis. c. 30. To. 2. Mor. p. 65.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ron. in c. 3. Naum. To. 6. p. 209.</NOTE> though it greatly haue

out, what it is: <HI>some</HI> assigning them, vnto the excesse or defect of the primary
Qualities of <HI>Heate, Cold, Moyst, Drye: some,</HI> vnto the impuritie and corrup|tion
of our meates: <HI>some,</HI> vnto the infection of vnwholesome and putrid
ayres; and to diuers such other Materiall causes; wherein they be greatly di|uided
amongst themselues: Yet is there a full agreement, both of <HI>Heathens,</HI>
and <HI>Christians,</HI> that God is the first <HI>Efficient cause</HI> of them; and that Sinne
is the true <HI>Impulsiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> cause,</HI> which inforceth him to send them. This the Pro|phet
<HI>Dauid</HI> expresly declareth, when he called <HI>Sicknesse, The Rebuke of God:</HI>
and affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 39. 11.</NOTE> that, <HI>For sinne, hee inflicts it, vpon man. When thou, with rebukes
doest chasten man for Sinne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 5. 12.</NOTE> <HI>thou makest his beautie to consume away.</HI> This al|so
the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> expresly declareth, when he telleth vs that, <HI>By one man,
Sinne entred into the world; and Death&punc; by Sinne.</HI> And againe, in another
place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 11. 30.</NOTE> where hee telleth the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that, for their Abuses in receiuing
the Sacrament, they were stroken by God, with diuers kinds of punishments:
some of them, with <HI>Sicknesse;</HI> some of them, with <HI>Weakenesse;</HI> and some of
them, with <HI>Death.</HI> Yea, and this our Sauiour <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe expresly decla|reth,
when hee biddeth the sick-man, whom hee had lately cured, <HI>to goe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 5. 14.</NOTE> <HI>and
sinne no more, lest a worse thing come vnto him.</HI> Thereby plainely declaring,
that his <HI>Sinne</HI> was both the cause of his former <HI>Sicknesse,</HI> and would bee also
of his future, if he sinned any more.</P>
<P>And, that <HI>Sinne</HI> is indeed the true cause of diseases, wee may see it plainely
verified, in all these memorable <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> that are recorded vnto vs, in the
<HI>Holy Scriptures. The Botches,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex&punc; 9. 10.</NOTE> wherewith the <HI>Egyptians wery smitten,</HI> was, for
their rebellion against God, and their oppression of his People. The <HI>Leprosie</HI>
wherewith the Prophetesse <HI>Miriam</HI> was smitten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 12. 8. 10.</NOTE> was, for being so enuious
against the Prophet <HI>Moses.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 25. 1. 2. 9.</NOTE> The <HI>Pestilence,</HI> wherewith the <HI>Israelites</HI> were
smitten, was for their <HI>adulterie</HI> with <HI>the Daughters of Moab;</HI> and for their
<HI>idolatrie</HI> with their prophane god.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 5. 6 9.</NOTE> The <HI>Emerods,</HI> wherewith <HI>the Phili|stins</HI>
were smitten, was, for their <HI>Impietie</HI> in detayning the <HI>Arke of
God.</HI></P>
<P>And so generally, in all the rest. There is almost, in no place, any mention
of any greiuous and exemplary <HI>Sicknesse,</HI> but there is, in the same place, some
mention of that Sinne, for whose punishment it was sent. In which forena|med
instances, we may obserue these <HI>two things.</HI> First, that, not onely <HI>the pesti|lence,</HI>
and <HI>leprosie,</HI> and such like grieuous and infectious <HI>Sicknesses</HI> (which are
called <HI>Morbi Sontici,</HI> that is, <HI>mischeiuous diseases</HI>) are the scourges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. Gellius. l. 20. c. 1. p. 280. b.</NOTE> and strokes
of God: but also all other inferior diseases, as <HI>Emerods,</HI> &amp; <HI>Botches,</HI> and such like
smaller annoyances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut 28. 27.</NOTE> as euen hee himselfe professeth in another place. Second|ly,
<PB N="236" REF="124">
that those diseases are sent by God vnto men, to correct and chasten them,
for their sinne.</P>
<P>Neither is this the testimony of the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> onely, but also of the
<HI>Heathens,</HI> euen in their owne Histories. Wherein, wee may obserue, that
whensoeuer there befell them, the publike calamity of any generall sicknesse,
they still imputed it vnto their sinnes, prouoking the anger of some or other
of their gods. As may be manifestly shewed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herod. l. 1. p. 51.</NOTE> by manifold instances. <HI>Herodo|tus</HI>
ascribeth that greiuous sicknesse which was sent vpon the <HI>Scythians,</HI> to
their sacrilege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pausan. in Achaicis, p. 279.</NOTE> in sacking the Temple of <HI>Venus. Pausanias</HI> ascribeth that de|uouring
sicknesse, which was sent among the <HI>Iones,</HI> vnto the profane lust of
<HI>Menalippus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Idem, in Arcadi|cij, p. 313.</NOTE> and <HI>Comaetho:</HI> And that generall abortion, which happened a|mong
the <HI>Caphyens</HI> wiues, onely vnto the cruelty of their bloody husbands;
in stoning (for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">leight cause) certaine young and wanton Children. The
hand of diuine Iustice inflicting their punishment, in the very same subiect,
wherein they had offended. Their crueltie exercised vpon other mens Chil|dren,
being iustly punished by the death of their owne, in a most equall reta|liation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idem in Beot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cis p. 353.</NOTE>
The same Author ascribeth the dropsie and <HI>lousie-sicknesse</HI> of <HI>Cassan|der,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Herod. l. 1. p. 66.</NOTE> vnto his crueltie and infidelitie vnto <HI>Alexander</HI> his Maister. And <HI>Herodo|tus</HI>
againe reporteth of the <HI>Persians,</HI> that they generally held, that whosoeuer
was smitten with the leprous infection, hee was surely a profane person; and
had (doubtles) committed some great and grieuous sinne, against their god,
<HI>the Sunne:</HI> though they knew not what it was. And therefore, they banished
them, out of all their Cities: collecting from the sicknesse, the stroke of
Gods Iustice, euen in an vnknowne Cause. And this, which we haue seene in
the Histories of the <HI>Greekes,</HI> wee may see yet more plainely, in the Histories
of the <HI>Romanes.</HI></P>
<P>For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vit. Romuli. p. 67. Liuie l. 6. p. 112.</NOTE> <HI>Plutarch</HI> ascribeth that destroying plague, which happened among
them, in the time of <HI>Romulus,</HI> vnto the trechery, which was practised in the
murther of <HI>Tatius.</HI> And <HI>Liuy</HI> ascribeth another such like plague, which fol|lowed
the condemnation of <HI>Manlius Capitolinus,</HI> vnto that iniustice, which
was vsed in his death. And thus haue, euen the Heathen, bene taught, in the
very Schoole of Nature, without going any further, that the true cause in|deede
of all sicknesse and diseases, are onely mens sinnes, prouoking Gods
Iustice to take vengeance of their wickednesse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 38. 3.</NOTE> As <HI>Dauid</HI> plainely confesseth
in one of the <HI>Psalmes, There is nothing sound in my flesh, becouse of thine anger;
neither is there rest in my bones, because of my sinne.</HI></P>
<P>2 Which Lesson, may,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God threat|neth sicknesse for mens sins. Leuit. 26. 16. 15. Deut. 7. 15.</NOTE> yet a great deale more perfectly, bee learned, in
the holy Schoole of God. For there, hee himselfe threatneth (and that, in
many places) that, if men doe refuse to obey his Commandements, hee will
punish their disobedience, with diuers greiuous sicknesses. Of which places
(for example) I will instance but in one: which is, indeed, most excellent; and
which, very sufficiently, may serue for all the rest. It is, in the Booke of <HI>Deu|teronomy.</HI>
Where, God threatneth most seuerely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 28. 15. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> that, <HI>If they will not obey
the voice of the Lord, to keepe, and to do his commandements, and ordinances:
that then all these Curses shall come vpon them, and ouertake them. Cursed shall
they be in the Towne, and cursed in the field. Cursed in their basket, and cursed
in their dough. Cursed in the fruite of their body, in the fruite of their land,
<PB N="237" REF="124">
and in the fruite of their Cattle. Cursed when they go out,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deu. 28. 21. 22. 27. 28. 35. 59.</NOTE> <HI>and cursed when they
come in.</HI> Yet further. <HI>That the Lord will make the Pestilence to cleaue vnto
them, vntill he haue consumed them. That he will smite them, with the consump|tion,
and with the feuer, and with the burning ague, and with the feruent heate,
and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildewe. And with the botch
of Egypt, and with the Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rods, and with the scab, and with the itch; so that
they cannot be healed. And with madnesse, and with blindnesse, and with astony|i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.
And that he, will smite them, in the knees, and in the thighes, with

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ppe of the he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d. And that he will make their plagu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s wonderfull, and the
plagues of their seede, euen great plagues, and of long continuance; and sore
diseases, and of long durance.</HI> So that, they shal want that common comfort of
al sicknesses; <HI>Si longus, leuis; si grauis, breuis, that if it be long,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. De <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">in. p. 62.</NOTE> <HI>it wil be the lighter;
and if it be fierce, it will be the shorter.</HI> But hee threatneth such a sicknesse, as
shall be, both <HI>Longus</HI> and <HI>Grauis: both fierce, and of continuance.</HI> And hee
brought such a one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Chro.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">1. 13. 14. &amp;c.</NOTE> vpon the King <HI>Iehoram:</HI> whom, for his crueltie and ido|latrie,
God threatned to plague, with an incurable sicknesse, which should ex|haust
and consume him, by the rotting of his bowells. Which sicknesse, be|ing
sent accordingly vnto him, it dispatcht him not at once (as it did <HI>Herod,</HI>
and <HI>Antiochus</HI>) but,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 12. 23. 2. Mac. 9. 9.</NOTE> held him in greiuous torments, for the space of two
whole yeares. Now, thus many threates of so many sicknesses, God would
neuer haue made, but that he knew his owne power, and could command all
maner of diseases, at his wil &amp; pleasure. For, to threaten, is ridiculous; but euen
among vs men, where, there is not a power, to inflict, what one doth threaten?</P>
<P>3 But, that hee threatned not more in word, then hee was well able to
performe in deede,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God sendeth all kinds of sicknesses vnto men.</NOTE> we may euidently see throughout the whole tract of the
holy historie. Where there is so particular mention, of all those same disea|ses,
to haue beene really inflicted by God, which, before, by name are mentio|ned,
that it manifestly appeareth, that God is both mindfull and true of his
word&punc; most faithfully performing, not onely what he promiseth, but also what
hee threatneth And therefore saith S. <HI>Augustine. Nemo dicat, in corde suo;
Verum est, quod promittit; falsum, quod minatur. Nam sicut, quod pro|mittit
verum est; sic quod minatur, certum est. Let no man once surmise,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in Psal. 94. To. 8. p. 1070.</NOTE>
<HI>that God is true, in his promises; but false, in his threatnings. For, as
that, which he promiseth, is true: so that, which he threatneth, is sure.</HI> As we may
euidently see, in all those particular diseases, which, in the fore-alledged place,
God reckoneth vp vnto vs. For the first of them, <HI>the Plague:</HI> God in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">licted
that sicknes, vpon his owne people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 16. 41, 46.</NOTE> <HI>the Israelites,</HI> for their grudging and mur|muring
against the Prophet <HI>Moses.</HI> For the second of them, <HI>the Consumpti|on:</HI>
he inflicted that sicknesse vpon the wicked King <HI>Iehoram:</HI> of whom it is
recorded expresly, that hee was, <HI>Longa consumtus tabe.</HI> Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Chro.</HI> 21. 19. in Vulgata.</NOTE> and the good
King <HI>Dauid</HI> was also touched with it, as it may bee gathered out of his owne
complaint: <HI>I am euen consumed by the stroke of thine hand.</HI> For the third of
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 39. 10.</NOTE> <HI>the Feuer:</HI> hee inflicted that sicknesse, both vpon <HI>Peters wiues mother,</HI>
and vpon <HI>Publius his father.</HI> For the fourth of them, <HI>The feruent heate:</HI> hee
inflicted that sicknesse, at another time, vpon the <HI>Israelites. The inhabitants
of the Land, are burned vp, and few men are left.</HI> Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay. 24 6.</NOTE> and euen heerein also
<PB N="238" REF="125">
he spared not his owne beloued <HI>Dauid.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme 38. 7.</NOTE> Who complaineth againe, <HI>That

For the fift of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 9. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Boyles and Botches:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay, 1. 6.</NOTE> though they be called in that place
<HI>the Botch of Egypt;</HI> yet inflicted hee it, not onely vpon the <HI>Egyptians,</HI>
but also vpon the <HI>Iewes. From the sole of the foote vnto the head,
there is nothing whole, but wounds, and swelling, and sores: full of Cor|ruption.</HI>
For the sixt of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 5. 9. 12.</NOTE> <HI>the Emerods:</HI> he inflicted that disease, vpon
<HI>the Philistims.</HI> For the seauenth of them, <HI>the itch and the scabb:</HI> hee inflicted
that disease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 2. 7. 8.</NOTE> vpon his seruant <HI>Iob.</HI> For the eight of them, <HI>Madnesse:</HI> hee in|flicted
that euill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 19. 14.</NOTE> vpon the Princes of <HI>Noph, by mingling among them, the
spirit of giddinesse.</HI> For the ninth of them, <HI>Blindnesse:</HI> hee inflicted that
euill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 19. 11. 2.</NOTE> both vpon the <HI>Sodomites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kin. 6. 18.</NOTE> and vpon the <HI>Aramites.</HI> And for the tenth,
and last of them, that is to say, <HI>Amazement</HI> and <HI>Astonishment of heart:</HI> hee
inflicted that disease vpon King <HI>Antiochus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Mac. 6. 8 9. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>When the King had heard these
words, he was astonished and sore moued: therefore hee layde him downe vpon
his bed, and fell sicke for sorrow: confessing that his sleepe was departed from
him, and that, for very care, his heart fayled within him.</HI> So that, there is none
of all the fore-named sicknesses, which he threatened in word, but he sheweth
that hee had power to inflict the same in deed. By all which memorable in|stances,
it euidently appeareth, that there is no sicknesse at all, neither so great
nor so little, but that God can inflict it, both when, and where he will.</P>
<P>Yea, and euen the very Heathen confesse also the same. For, euen their owne
Histories, as well as <HI>the Scriptures,</HI> do number all the forenamed diseases to
be nothing else indeed, but onely diuine punishments. For the first of them
<HI>the Plague:</HI> that memorable <HI>Pestilence,</HI> which <HI>Homer</HI> so describeth to haue

the <HI>Philistims</HI> would faine imagine: but (as they found vnto their cost) they
bee sent vnto men by the ordinance of God. <HI>They come not out of the dust:</HI>
as <HI>Iob</HI> teacheth in his booke, that is: Not onely from their second and infe|rior
causes, but from God their <HI>first Cause.</HI> Who, as sometimes hee worketh
with those naturall Causes, by infecting the aire, and corrupting the water;
and blasting our fruites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 28. 22.</NOTE> with vnwholesome dewes and mildewes, as hee him|selfe
professeth: so worketh hee often-times without them, by his owne im|mediate
stroke: As when he sent his Angell into the host of <HI>Seneherib,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Kings, 19. 35.</NOTE> and,
in one night destroyed to the number of an hundred and fourescore and fiue
thousand. And therefore Saint <HI>Hierom,</HI> inquiring into the true cause of all
sicknesse, hee flyeth aboue those inferior and naturall concauses, vnto the su|preme
and supernaturall Cause. <HI>Non dubitemus, ista dicere, vocem flagel|lorum

Gods scourge: though some men do impute it vnto the corrupnes of the ayre, or
to the vncleannesse of our meates, or to some one diuesity or other in our bodies.</HI>
But the true, and the first cause, indeed, is onely God. For, as <HI>Stobaeus</HI> hath
noted, out of <HI>Euripides:</HI>
<Q><L>Morbi mortalium alij, nostraculpa, fiunt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stobaeus Serm. 98 p. 539.</NOTE></L>

<PB N="241" REF="127">
Nay alwayes by Gods iudgment. And then, most of all, when they come by
our fault; whether our fault in feeding, or our fault in liuing; they still come
by Gods sending. For as the Tragicall Poet hath very truly noted:
<Q><L>Quicquid patimur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> Act 5. See. 2. p. 257.</NOTE> mortale genus,</L>

And a little after. <HI>Saepe, peccatorum sunt flagella, infirmitates. Sicknesses are
often sent vs, for our instruction sake. Oftimes, our sorrowes and infirmities,
are the scourges of our sinnes and iniquities.</HI> And this we may further see, by
the iudgement of <HI>Physitions;</HI> vnto whose art it more properly belongeth, to
search out the true causes of all diseases. For, they often-times doe finde, in
many Sicknesses, that, beside the disor'red and peccant humors of mens bo|dies,
which are the materiall cause of all Sicknesse, there is in it beside, the
speciall stroke of Gods hand. Whereunto they are inforced to reduce it, as
vnto his true and proper Efficient. Because they see it oftentimes to fall out
that many diseases, which they, at the first, thought to be but slight and con|temptible;
yet doe proue, in the end, to be mortall, and incurable: doe
they all what they can; the power of their medicines, being manifestly hin|dered,
from their naturall working, in the body of <HI>this</HI> man, which yet worke
most kindly, in the body of <HI>another</HI> man. For (as <HI>Solon</HI> obserueth, to this
very purpose:

<L>Ofttimes we see, from small greene wounds, and from a litle griefe,</L>
<L>A greater Sore and Sicknesse grow's, then will admit reliefe.</L></Q>
So that, as another Poet, in the same case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ovid. l. 1. De Ponto Eleg. 4. p 160. b.</NOTE> obserueth:
<Q><L>Non est in medico semper, releuetur vt aeger:</L>

<P>And this incurablenesse in euery sicknesse (which is, indeed, the very soule

held his case for desperate: and that it was but in vaine, to apply any medi|cine.
For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 16. ad Attic. epist. 339. p. 408.</NOTE> as the <HI>Roman</HI> Orator hath recorded of him: <HI>Desperatis, Hippocrates
vetat adhibere medicinam: Hippocrates forbiddeth the Physition, to apply any

the Case is not so despereate. For then, no sicknesse should be cured. Be|cause,
in euery sicknesse, there is the stroke of God. There is no sicknes so lit|tle,
but God hath a finger in it, if it be but the aking of thy little finger.
For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch in A|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">atorio. To. 3. p. 403.</NOTE> though there be in the body, but onely one disease, that is called <HI>Sacer

by God himselfe, who chalengeth it; and by the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> which ascribe it;
and by the <HI>Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">thers,</HI> who teach it; and by the very Heathen themselues which
confesse it. For the first of which foure proofes, to wit, the chalenge of God:
The Lord himselfe expresly threateneth in the fore-alledged place, <HI>That he wil
smite them with the Consumption, and with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">euer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 28, 22.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; with the burning Ague,
and with the feruent Heate, and with the Sword, and with Blastings, and with

that all those diseases are as truely Gods smiting, as his smiting
with the <HI>Sword,</HI> which hee numbreth there among them. And againe hee
threateneth, in the very same place, that he <HI>will smite them, with the Botch of
Egypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 28 27.</NOTE> <HI>and with the Emerods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 28 28.</NOTE> and with the Scab, and with the Itch.</HI> And yet a|gaine:
<HI>that he will smite them, with Madnesse, and with Blindnesse; and with
Astonying of heart.</HI> So that, all those Sicknesses, he chalengeth and assumeth
to be his strokes, and his Smitings.</P>
<P>Yea, and the <HI>Scriptures</HI> themselues ascribe the same vnto him, yea, and vn|der
the same name: and that in both Testaments. In the Old, the Lord de|nounceth
against King <HI>Pharaoh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 4. 14.</NOTE> that <HI>if he will not let the Israelites depart, he

the Author of both their infirmities, was God: because the Deuill could do
nothing, but as hee was fore-limited. And therefore, euen the Heathen, who
before confessed sicknesse to be sent from God, yea and to be sent, as a punish|ment,
for sinne, against God, do also acknowledge it, to be the <HI>Stroke of God.

This he reporteth for the common opinion of all the Heathen, that all of

they be the <HI>Strokes</HI> of his darts, and arrowes. Which, wee may further see

of my Sinnes.</HI> Which place of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> expresseth in effect, the whole
summe of this Chapter, and of euery Branch of it. First, naming the Cause

of his sicknesse, to be <HI>Sinne</HI> Secondly, the Effect of his sinne, to be Gods an|ger.
Thirdly, the fruite of Gods anger, to be his sicknesse. And fourthly, the
forme of his sicknesse, to be (as it were) the stroke of an Arrow. Now (to
forme this whole discourse, vnto our present purpose:) If the true cause of
sicknesse, be onely Sinne against God: If God himselfe doe threaten, for this
cause to send sicknesse: If he truly hath performed, as much as he hath threate|ned:
And, if sicknesse be nothing else, but the <HI>Stroke of Gods hand:</HI> Then
must there needs be a God, which worketh all those things. But all the fore-named
points haue sufficiently beene proued, not onely by Scriptures, and
the doctrine of <HI>Christians;</HI> but also by the testimonie, euen of the very <HI>Hea|then.</HI>
And therefore, <HI>That there is a God,</HI> doth neede no further proofe. This

<HEAD>CHAP. 6.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The God is the giuer of health vnto men. 2. That hee is the preseruer of it.
3. That he is the restorer of it. 4. Both by giuing medicinable herbes vn|to
men. 5. And by teaching them the right vses of them. 6. And by ioy|ning
his blessing vnto their working.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THat sicknesses and diseases doe not come to men by chance, nor
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> out of the dust;</HI> but are sent by the <HI>Iustice</HI> and <HI>Iudgement
of God,</HI> either to correct men for sinning, or to restruine men
from sinning; I haue already proued in the former Chapter.
Now, that the Remedies of diseases are also sent from God,
and from none other author, I take to proue in this Chapter. A thing, which
followeth, in a manner, vpon the granting of the former. For, if wee grant,
that God is the Author of diseases; we must also grant, that he is the Author
of Remedies. Or else, we shall be forced to yeeld vnto the one, of these two
grosse absurdities: Either, that there be two Gods; or else, that something,
which is not God, yet is better then God. For, if we yeeld, that diseases come
from one Author, and their Remedies from another; then doe wee make two
diuers Authors: <HI>Duo Principia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. De Iside. To. 2. p. 190.</NOTE> <HI>Two Principles,</HI> and <HI>two Gods,</HI> as <HI>Zoroastres</HI> did.
And if we hold, that that Author, from whome Remedies doe come, is not
God; then hold we, that something is better then God. For, it is better to
giue Remedies, then it is to giue diseases: as it is better to giue good things,
then it is, to giue euill. So that, except God be the Author of Remedies, as
well as of diseases, he shall not be the Soueraigne fountaine of Goodnesse,
but shall haue a more base and inferior office, then some of his owne crea|tures.
And so, God shall not be God: But that other, which is the giuer of
good things;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato, l. 2 De Re|pub. p 554.</NOTE> shall be God. For, (as <HI>Plato</HI> truly teacheth) <HI>Bonorum, solus
Deus, causa est: malorum ver&ograve;, quamlibet aliam, praeter Deum, caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m quaerere
decet. It is onely God, that is the Cause of all good things: but euill things haue
not God, but some other thing, for their cause.</HI> Therefore, for the clearing of
this doubt; that there be not two diuers Authors and Princes in the world;
the one sending diseases; the other, their Remedies; but, that both of these
doe come from one Author, who is God, and none other; it is euidently
<PB N="245" REF="129">
anounched, in the Holy Scripture, as it were of set purpose, for the preuenting
of this error.</P>
<P>Thus the Prophet <HI>Moses</HI> telleth the <HI>Israelites,</HI> that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 15.</NOTE> <HI>If they will obey al Gods
holy commandements, the Lord will both take from them, all their owne in fir|mities,
and will not put vpon them, any Egyptian diseases.</HI> Thereby plainely in|sinuating,
that it is absolutely in Gods power, both to impose diseases, and to
send releases. Thus <HI>Eliphaz,</HI> without all insinuation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 5. 18.</NOTE> affirmeth in expresse and
plaine tearmes: <HI>God maketh the wound, and he bindeth it; he smiteth, and his
hand maketh whole.</HI> Thus <HI>Hannah,</HI> in her song, <HI>The Lord killeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 2. 6.</NOTE> <HI>and maketh
aliue; he bringeth downe vnto the graue, and heraiseth vp.</HI> Thus <HI>Moses,</HI> in his
Psalme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 90. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Thou turnest a man vnto destruction; Againe thou saist, Returne, yee
sonnes of Adam.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 6. 1.</NOTE> Thus likewise <HI>Hosea: The Lord hath wounded, and hee will
binde vs vp.</HI> By all which Testimonies, it euidently appeareth, that there is
not one God which striketh vs, and another which healeth vs: but it is one
and the same God, which doth both these vnto vs.
<Q>Vna manus nobis vulnus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouid. l. 1. De Re|med. Amor. p. 292.</NOTE> opem&abque; feret.</Q>
As it is in the Poet.
<Q><L>All is but one, and selfe same hand, that thus,</L>
<L>Both one while hurteth, and that helpeth vs.</L></Q>
It is but one and the same God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. l. 3. cont. Marcion. c. 24. p. 400.</NOTE> <HI>Qui &amp; caedit, &amp; sanat:</HI> as it is in <HI>Tertullian
Who both killeth and cureth.</HI></P>
<P>Who yet is not <HI>good</HI> in the one action, and <HI>euill</HI> in the other; but truely
<HI>good</HI> in them both. <HI>Iust,</HI> when he afflicteth, which is one kinde of Goodnes;
and <HI>Mercifull</HI> when he releaseth, which is another kinde of Goodnesse. Nay,
<HI>then</HI> also mercifull, euen when he afflicteth: being <HI>Deus, ad inferos vs&abque; mise|ricors.</HI>
And therefore, <HI>Optimus, si reddit placatus, quod abstulerat iratus:</HI> as it
followeth in the same place. <HI>He is such a God, as is mercifull, euen downe vn|to
hell. And therefore must n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">edes be very excellently good, if hee restore that
health againe, when he is appeased, which he tooke away when he was displeased.</HI>
So that the very necessity of Reason inferreth, that if God be the sender of dis|eases
vnto men (as I haue formerly prooued him) then must hee also bee the
sender of remedies vnto them. Else can he not be God; nay, else can hee not
be Good. For how can he be either God or good, who is willing to hurt vs,
if he know, that he hath not the power againe to helpe vs? But God is truely
and perfectly good, and hath in this point as great a power, as he hath in any
other; and extendeth it as graciously vnto the benefit of all men: being indeed
both the Giuer and the Preseruer, and the Restorer of health vnto them; from
whose onely grace and fauour, all these heauenly blessings come.</P>
<P>For the first of which three points: <HI>That God is the Giuer of health vnto
men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">God is the Gi|uer of health.</NOTE> the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> expressely affirmeth it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 28. 7.</NOTE> in calling God in one place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 27. 1.</NOTE>
<HI>His strength;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm. 94. 5.</NOTE> and in another, <HI>His saluation;</HI> and in another, <HI>The strength
of his saluation.</HI> The Fathers they acknowledge it: <HI>Philo Iudaeus</HI> deliuereth
his opinion in these words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo Iud. l. 2. de leg. allegor. p. 131</NOTE> <HI>Sic opinor, Sanitatem meram, quam nullus morbus
praecessit in corpore, Deum, perse, solum largiri: liberationem autem a morbo, e|tiam
per artem, aut medicinam; ipse sanans vel per haec, vel citra horum operam.
This is mine opinion, That pure and perfect health, which hath not beene attain|ted
with any sicknesse, is giuen immediately by onely God himselfe. But a release
<PB N="246" REF="130">
from any sicknesse, he oftentimes worketh by the meanes of Physicke; yet healing
vs, as he pleaseth, either with it, or without it.</HI> Acknowledging God directly,
not onely to be the bestower of health, but also the deliuerer from sicknesse.
So likewise <HI>Gregorie Nyssen: Hoc est perfectae Prouidentiae opus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Nyssen, l. de Infantibus praematur&egrave; abreptis p. 138.</NOTE> <HI>non sol&ugrave;m

is the worke of Gods perfect Prouidence, not only to cure Diseases, when they
are come vpon vs, but also to preuent them, before they come vnto vs.</HI> So like|wise

pulchritudinem, valetudinem, propagationem, foecunditatem, membrorum dispo|sitionem,
salutem. It is God that hath giuen vnto the body of a man, both his be|ginning,
and his beauty, his strength, and his foecunditie, his comelinesse, and his
Health.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and euen the very Heathen acknowledge also the very same. <HI>Critias</HI>

<L>It is God that hath giu'n good health vnto men,</L>

thereby,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iuie, l. 10. p. 170.</NOTE> that it is God, that is the Giuer of all health, and all safetie.
And therefore, among those other titles, which they bestowed vpon God,
they called him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Cicer. Orat. 4. in Ver. p. 105.</NOTE> <HI>Sotera,</HI> that is to say, <HI>A Sauiour, quia Salutem dat:</HI> as the

euen then, when they cure their Patients, yet doe it not by their owne power,
but by the power of God, who is the true <HI>Sauiour:</HI> yea, and the onely <HI>Sauiour</HI>
too. For, <HI>Beside him there is no Sauiour.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay, 43. 11. Aelian, l. 12. de var. Hist. c. 51. p. 489.</NOTE> And therefore, King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Ma|cedon</HI>

by the <HI>Romane</HI> Orator: <HI>Iupiter id est, Iuuans Pater:</HI> as though hee (like
another <HI>Iupiter</HI>) had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. de Nat. Deor. p. 210.</NOTE> in his hand, a full power, to bestow health and safety, vp|on
any man whomsoeuer. Which folly that wise King derided very sauorly:
and, in that his derision, acknowledged, that Health commeth onely from
God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Orat. Pro Quinto Ligario, p 541.</NOTE> and not from the Phisition. And therefore saith the Orator, that, <HI>Homi|nes
ad Deos, nulla re propi&ugrave;s accedunt, quam salutem hominibus dando. That
Men not come nerer vnto God in any thing, then they do, in giuing of health vn|to
men.</HI> But yet, this is not enough, to make them called <HI>Suiours.</HI> For hee that
properly is a <HI>Sauiour,</HI> must saue, onely by his owne power: as <HI>our Sauiour
Christ</HI> did. Who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 11. 5.</NOTE> both <HI>healed all infirmities,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10. 1. 8.</NOTE> and gaue all kindes of healths,
by his owne onely power: <HI>Sight, vnto the blind; Strength, vnto the lame;
<PB N="247" REF="130">
Hearing, to the deafe; Clensing, to the Lepers; and life vnto the dead:</HI> as is
expresly testified. So that, euen in this respect (though there were none other)
yet might <HI>he</HI> truly and properly be called a <HI>Sauiour</HI> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign">: as indeed hee is.
But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk 2. 11.</NOTE> as for his Disciples, though they did, all the same works; yet could none
of all them properly be called a <HI>Sauiour:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 4. 42.</NOTE> because they did them, not by their
owne power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act 3. 7. and 5. 15. &amp;. 19. 12.</NOTE> but by his. As the Apostle S. <HI>Peter</HI> ingenuously confesseth. <HI>Ye
men of Israel</HI> (saith he,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act 3. 2. 6. 2. 7. 12. 16.</NOTE> when he healed the Creeple, at the gate of the Tem|ple)
<HI>why meruaile ye at this thing? or why looke ye so stedfastly vpon vs? as
though we by our owne power, had made this man to goe. It is onely the name
of Iesus, that hath made this man sound.</HI> Not, that the <HI>name of Iesus</HI> (though
it signifie, <HI>A Sauiour</HI>) doth carrie with it any necessarie Charme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 1 21.</NOTE> for either
healing of diseases, or casting out of deuills, as some men vainely haue ima|gined:
for in the sons of <HI>Scaeua</HI> the <HI>Iew,</HI> the contrarie was plainely proued:
but, <HI>the Name of Iesus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 19. 13 &amp;c.</NOTE> that is to say, <HI>the power of Iesus, hath giuen this man
his strength.</HI> For, all the miracles, which his disciples wrought, were done on|ly
by his power; As is expresly testified, by plaine words in the Scripture:
<HI>He gaue them power, against vncleane spirits,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10. 1.</NOTE> <HI>and to heale euery sicknesse. They</HI>
had all <HI>their</HI> power, but onely by his gift. But <HI>he</HI> wrought <HI>all his</HI> miracles, on|ly
by his owne might. They wrought theirs, but <HI>Precando:</HI> but he his, <HI>Im|perando:</HI>
as <HI>Hegesippus</HI> distinguisheth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hegesip. l. 2. de excidio vrbis. c. 12. p. 261.</NOTE> And therefore, though they saued
many from very grieuous sicknesses: yet they, doing those works, not by
their owne power, but onely by our <HI>Sauiour Christ Iesus</HI> his power; not they,
but he meriteth the name of a <HI>Sauiour:</HI> as being the very fountaine, from
whence all health springeth vnto euery man. So that, it is, neither the strong
constitution of our parents, nor the well-tempered complexion of our

And therefore the Prophet <HI>Dauid,</HI> with thankfulnesse, professeth, that, <HI>It is

men from sicknesse; but also vpholdeth them in their health. Without whose
speciall prouidence, in keeping them, they shall neuer be able, to perserue
themselues, though they vse neuer so great carefulnesse, or haue, at their el|bowes,

<P>Yea, and euen the very Heathen doe hold, in their Religion, that God is
not onely the Giuer of health, but also the Preseruer and maintayner of it.

Ascribing to their gods, not onely the giuing, both of health and all good

<L>We pray, with thy praescruing blesse.</L></Q>
Acknowledging the continuing, as well as the giuing of all good things, to
be onely of Gods goodnesse. But, aboue all the rest, the continuance of our
health. For, as <HI>Tullie</HI> recordeth; among <HI>Iupiters</HI> other Titles, hee was cal|led,
<HI>Salutaris,</HI> that is, <HI>The Giuer of Health.</HI> Of which his appellation, he ren|dreth
this reason;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. de. Fin. p. 76.</NOTE> <HI>Quia salus hominum in eius sit tutela: Because all a mans

<PB N="249" REF="131">
<HI>Maximinus,</HI> though otherwise most irreligious; yet ascribeth it one|ly

which is the Preseruer, and Maintainer of mans health.</P>
<P>3 Now, as God is both the Giuer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God is the Restorer of Health.</NOTE> and Preseruer of health: so is he also,
the Restorer of it. Hee both gaue it vnto vs, when we had it not: and pre|serueth
it vnto vs, whilst wee haue it: and restoreth it vnto vs, when as wee
haue lost it. And this point may also, as clearely be demonstrated, by the Testi|monies,
both of Holy Scriptures, and of Heathen writers, as any of the for|mer.
Of which Testimonies, some bee such, as doe onely expresse their opi|nion,
in words: some such, as declare the strength of it, by deedes: and some
such, as demonstrate the truth of it, by effects. For the first of which three
heads: the Prophet <HI>Moses</HI> assureth the <HI>Israelites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 7. 15.</NOTE> that, if they will obey Gods
holy Lawes and Ordinances, hee will, not only <HI>take all infirmities from them,</HI>
but also, <HI>will not put any euill disease vpon them.</HI> Thereby plainely declaring,
that God hath a power in him; both to preserue men in their health; and to
bring them vnto sicknesse; and to deliuer them from sicknesse. The Prophet
<HI>Dauid</HI> likewise expresly confesseth, that it is the Lord onely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 103. 3.</NOTE> <HI>which both forgi|ueth
all our iniquities, and healeth all our infirmities.</HI> Taking first away the
Cause of our Sicknesse, which is onely our sinne: and then applying his
owne healing grace, as a soueraigne Medicine. And so likewise <HI>Iehoram</HI> King
of <HI>Israel</HI> confesseth, by insinuation, euen the very same thing. For, when the
King of <HI>Aram</HI> writ vnto him, that he should heale the Leprosie of <HI>Naaman:</HI>
hee asked in great passion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Kin. 5. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Whether he were a God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Kin. 5. 15.</NOTE> that he should doe this great
thing?</HI> Thereby manifestly insinuating, that the power of healing is the worke
of a God, and not of a man. Yea, and euen <HI>Naaman</HI> himselfe, when the
worke was done, acknowledged, that God was the onely doer of it: <HI>Now I
know, there is no God, in all the world, but in Israel.</HI> And how came hee to
know this? He knew it, by the miraculous healing of his sicknesse. For, as
<HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI> directly testifieth: <HI>The power of healing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 38. 2.</NOTE> <HI>commeth onely from the
most High.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and euen the very Heathen do hold the same opinion. <HI>Coelius Rhodi|ginus</HI>
reporteth out of <HI>Plutarchs Symposiachs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coel. Rhodigin. l. 19. c. 11. p. 1354. Plut. l. 4. Sympos. Quaest. 1. To. 3. Mor. p. 239.</NOTE> of a very notable and learned
Phisition, named <HI>Philon;</HI> that hee, hauing confected diuers excellent Medi|cines,
<HI>Regia quaedam, &amp; auxiliaria medicamenta;</HI> called those his Medicines,
<GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, <HI>the hands of God.</HI> Which glorious appellation, whether
he doe <HI>irreligiously</HI> apply vnto his owne medicines, as though they were able
to procure a mans health, as well as Gods owne hands; or <HI>religiously,</HI> as not
being able to worke any health, without the helpe of Gods hand: yet both
wayes, he acknowledgeth, the working of health, to bee the power of Gods
owne hand.</P>
<P>And so doth <HI>Tully</HI> likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 14. Epist. Fam. Ep. 7. 162.</NOTE> when he writeth thus, vnto his wife: <HI>Statim ita
leuatus sum, vt mihi Deus aliquis fecisse medicinam videatur: I was sodainely so
eased, as if a medicine had bene sent vnto me from God.</HI> Thereby plainely ac|knowledging,
that the hand of God is the most soueraigne Medicine. And
thus, both Christians and Heathens haue deliuered their opinions, in ex|presse
<PB N="250" REF="132">
and plaine words: <HI>That it is onely God himselfe, that is the Restorer of
men, vnto their health.</HI></P>
<P>And, that this is not, in them, onely a verball profession, or a volant and
fleeting imagination, but a very strong perswasion, both inwardly setled and
deepely grounded in them, as a sprout of naturall Religion; they haue, both
of them, declared, as well by their deedes, as they haue by their words:
which is the second sort of our Testimonies. For, euer, when they haue beene
afflicted with any kind of sicknesse, either publike, or priuate, they haue
still sought, to obtaine their remedy from God, by offering vp vnto him,
both <HI>Supplications,</HI> and <HI>Sacrifices;</HI> as vnto the onely Restorer of their
health. Thus did <HI>Moses;</HI> when,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 11. 1, 2.</NOTE> by the <HI>fire of God,</HI> very many of the <HI>Israe|lites</HI>
were deuoured and consumed, he sought for the remedie, only at his gra|cious
hand: vsing prayer, for his water, to extinguish that fire. Thus likewise
did <HI>Aaron;</HI> when a grieuous <HI>plague was sent by God himselfe, among them,</HI> he
sought onely for the remedie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 16. 47, 48</NOTE> at that hand which had smitten them, by <HI>offe|ring
vp incense, for a sauour of rest, and making an atonement for the people,
with God.</HI> And thus likewise did King <HI>Dauid;</HI> when,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Sam, 24. 25.</NOTE> at another time, ano|ther
like plague happened, he sought for the remedie onely at the hand of
God, by appeasing of his wrath, <HI>with Burnt-Offerings, and Peace-Offerings.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and euen the very Heathens themselues, in all their like Calamities,
haue euer held this, for the chiefest of their Medicines, to obtaine release of
God, by their prayers and supplications. Whereof, euen their owne Histories
affoord vs both great plenty, and great variety of Examples. In that great
plague,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homer, l. 1. Iliad p. 5. B.</NOTE> which hapned in the Campe of the Greekes, at the siege of <HI>Troy;</HI> they
sought onely, for their remedie, at the hand of God, by lenifying his an|ger,
with <HI>sacrifice and prayer; precibus &amp; sacrificijs.</HI> In that great plague,
which hapned vnto the <HI>Aeginets;</HI> their King sought for remedie, at the hand
of God onely.
<Q><L>Ipse ego sacra <HI>Ioui</HI> pro me Patri&aacute;&abque;,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouid. l. 7. Me|tam. p. 280.</NOTE> &amp;c:</L>
<L>Euen I my selfe, do, for my selfe, and for my Countries sake,</L>
<L>To <HI>Iupiter</HI> by sacrifice, our whole atonement make.</L></Q>
In that great plague, which happened among the <HI>Athenians;</HI> they consulted
with <HI>Apollo,</HI> what should be their best remedie: vnto whom, when hee an|swered;
<HI>That they should purge and cleanse their Citie:</HI> whenas they were de|uising
how to doe it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r &amp;. in vit. Epimen. p. 39.</NOTE> by other meanes; <HI>Epimenides</HI> aduised them to performe
it by <HI>sacrifice:</HI> which is indeed the best purgation, and the most certaine ex|piation.</P>
<P>Yea and the Romane <HI>Storie</HI> affoords no lesse varietie: as we may euident|ly
see, in many places of <HI>Liuie.</HI> In that great plague, which happened among
the <HI>Romans,</HI> in the time of <HI>Tullus Hostilius,</HI> they all of them went into this
opinion: <HI>Vnam opem aegris corporibus relictam; si pax venia&abque; ab Dijs impetra|ta
esset: That there was but one Remedie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Liuie, l. 1. p. 12.</NOTE> <HI>for those that were sicke; and that was,
to obtaine peace and pardon of God.</HI> And that their practise was sutable vnto
their opinion, he hath giuen vs, in another place, a very notable instance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liuie, l. 5. p. 91.</NOTE> in
that great plague, which hapned in the time of <HI>Camillus.</HI> Where their expi|ation
was performed with so great a solemitie, as equalled almost that of
<HI>Iosias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Kin. 23.</NOTE> for ceremony. Which in these words is described, and set out, by <HI>Liuie:</HI></P>

Whether it grew from the vnwholsomnesse of the Ayre, occasioned by many
sodaine alterations, or from some other cause: but pernicious it was vnto all li|uing
things. Of which incurable euill, whenas they could neither finde out any
cause, nor perceiue any end, the Senators decreed; that the bookes of Sibylla
shold be searched; that two officers should be appointed, to looke to the performance
of their holy seruice: their holy feasting in their Temples (which they call their
Lectisternium) being at that time first ordayned in the Citie of Rome; for eight
whole dayes together, they appeased the anger, both of their God Apollo, and of
his mother Latona, and of his sister Diana; and of Hercules, Mercurius, and
Neptunus: the Feast being held as sumptuously, as in those dayes could be possi|bly,
in three seuerall places. Yea, and the same Feast was kept holy, as well pri|uately,
as publikely. All the dores in the Cittie were then set wide open: All
things, for the time, were vsed in common: all men, both knowne and vnknowne,
yea and euen the very Strangers, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">alled into their houses: Louing con|ferences
were vsed, euen with their very enemies; and an vtter cessation of all
suites, debates, and quarells: Yea the Prison dores were opened, during all those
high feast-dayes. And those, that, by the benefit of their gods, were then relea|sed,
were neuer after that (vpon meere Religion) imprisoned. <HI>Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">arre
proceedeth</HI> Livie. <HI>Out of which his narration we may obserue these two
things. First, that though this great plague might, in part, be attributed vnto
the often and sodaine alteration of the ayre, as vnto an immediate and in|ferior
Cause: yet that they looked higher, vnto the first Cause, and ascribed
it to God, from whom it came indeed. Secondly, that, as they acknowledged
the disease to come from God: so they sought for their remedie, no where
else, but of God. So confessing him directly, to be both the sender of sick|nesse,
and the Restorer of health. As we may euidently see, in the very same
Author, by diuers other instances, in diuers other places: as namely.</HI> Lib. 7.
p. 121. 129. Lib. 10. p. 187. Lib. 27. p. 308. Lib. 38. p 482. Lib. 41. p. 528. <HI>In
all which places,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Livi.</NOTE> <HI>he, reporting of very greiuous plagues, sheweth still, that
they sought for their remedie at God, by appeasing of his wrath, with their
Sacrifices and prayers. This sense hath God ingra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ted both into</HI> Christians,
<HI>and</HI> Heathens.</P>
<P>Neither doth Religion onely teach them, to seeke their remedie at God,
in such publique calamities, but also euen in their priuate sicknesses. King
<HI>Dauid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 41. 4.</NOTE> being afflicted with a dangerous sicknesse, maketh this request to God,
<HI>Heale me (&ocirc; Lord) I haue sinned against thee.</HI> Thereby plainely insinuating
<PB N="252" REF="133">
these three things vnto vs. First, that onely sinne is the cause of all sicknesse.
Secondly, that onely God is the restorer vnto health. And Thirdly, that on|ly
Prayer is the meanes of obtayning that grace. And though it may seeme
a very strange request, to desire God to heale him, because hee had sinned a|gainst
him: which was the very cause, for which God had smitten him: yet
it is not so indeed, if the words be well resolued. For his meaning is no more
but this: that God, who had stricken him, for committing of his sinne; should
now againe heale him, for confessing of his sinne. As if he should say, as it
is in the Orator,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Epist. Octa|viano, p. 223.</NOTE> <HI>Sit erranti medicina confessio. Let my confession be my Me|dicine.</HI>
Or, as in other words <HI>He</HI> expresseth it, but to the same effect: <HI>Let my
prayer ascend vp before thee, as incense; and the lifting vp of my hands be as
an euening Sacrifice.</HI> Thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 141. 2.</NOTE> in his priuate sicknesse, as well as in the publike,
he sought for all his helpe, at the onely hand of God.</P>
<P>And the same disposition is also ingrafted into the mindes of the Heathen:
Who (<HI>as Iuuenal</HI> obserueth) <HI>if they chance but to feele the least touch of a
feuer, they straightway interpret it the effect of Gods Anger:</HI> and therefore they
doe presently betake them to their vowes, and seeke to appease him by the
promise of some sacrifice. They doe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iuuenal. Satyr. 13. p. 60. B.</NOTE>
<Q><L>&mdash;Pecudem spondere sacello</L>
<L>Balantem, &amp; Laribus cristam promittere Galli.</L>
<L>They vow vnto the Shrine, a bleating sheepe,</L>
<L>And to the Gods that doe their Houses keepe,</L>
<L>They vow their Cocks heads, &amp;c.</L></Q>
Thus haue they beene taught, euen by the light of Reason, that, if the disease
haue proceeded from God, the ease must also be sought for at his hand. For
(as <HI>Aquinas</HI> hath very well obserued) <HI>The Remedie must alwayes be proportio|nated
vnto the Meladie: else will it do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> no good. Medicus</HI> (saith he) <HI>non tan|to
mag&igrave;s sanat, quanto maiorem dat medicinam; sed quanto medicina est mor|bo
mag&igrave;s proportionata. The Physitian doth not alwayes then heale the most
strongly, when he giueth the strongest medicines; but when the medicine, which
he ministreth, is best tempered, and proportioned vnto the qualitie of the sick|nesse.</HI>
And therefore, if the sicknesse haue proceeded from God, it is but
<HI>Medicina proportionata,</HI> that is to say, <HI>a Medicine made in his due proportion,</HI>
that the Remedie should also be fetched from him.</P>
<P>And, that, in thus doing, they haue not beene deceiued, neither in their
practice, nor in their opinion, God himselfe hath declared, by euident de|monstration:
by sending a present release from euery sicknesse, whensoeuer
they entreated it by their prayers and supplications,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Chap. this Sect. prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</NOTE> as all the fore-named
Authors, in all the fore-named places, haue left testified vnto vs: which is the
third ranke of our testimonies. For in all the selfe same places, where there is
mention made both of the diseases to be sent from God, and of helpe to haue
beene entreated of him; there is also mention made, that, at their supplica|tions,
it hath beene sent vnto them. As the Reader may plainly see, in all the
fore-alledged places, both of the holy Scriptures, and of the secular writers.
Vnto whom, for breuities sake, I refere him.</P>
<P>By all which Examples and Testimonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nonius in voce, preca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tur.</NOTE> it appeareth that the most soue|raigne
Medicine, for the cure of any sicknesse, is, <HI>vti Serapi medicina, &amp; quo|tidie

precari:</HI> as <HI>Varro</HI> aduiseth: <HI>to vse the medicine of Serapus;</HI> and to powre
out vnto God, our continuall and dayly prayers. And therefore the wise
King <HI>Salomon,</HI> in that solemne and excellent prayer, which he made when he
dedicated his new built Temple vnto God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kings, 8. 37. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> hee made this request for one;
that, if either <HI>Famine,</HI> or <HI>Pestilence,</HI> or <HI>Blasting,</HI> or <HI>Mildew,</HI> or <HI>Grashopper,</HI> or
<HI>Caterpiller,</HI> should at any time afflict them; if they came into that house, and
there should powreout their supplications vnto God; that their prayer
might be accepted, and their punishment released. Thereby plainely insi|nuating,
that <HI>Prayer</HI> vnto God, is <HI>Panchrestum medicamentum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Orat, 5, in Ver. p. 137.</NOTE> as the

more soundly by his effectuall prayers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1, Kings, 20. 2. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> then could a whole Colledge of the

that he would prosper that which is giuen for thine ease, and their Phisicke for

<HI>Is any man sicke among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let
them pray for him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames, 5. 14. 15.</NOTE> <HI>and anoint him with oyle in the name of the Lord. And the
prayer of faith shall saue the sicke, and the Lord will raise him vp: and if hee
haue committed any sinne, it shall be forgiuen him.</HI> In which place is congested,
the whole summe of all those heades which before I haue collected, both in
this present Chapter, and also in the former, namely; First, that Sinne <HI>is the
true cause of sicknesse,</HI> vpon whose forgiuenesse there followeth a release, as
<HI>Mathew,</HI> 9. 2. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mathew, 9. 2.</NOTE> that God for this cause, sendeth sicknesse vnto men.
Thirdly, that God is not onely the sender of sicknesse, but also the restorer
vnto health. And fourthly, that the principall meanes to recouer, is earnest
and hearty prayer; our owne, our Phisitions, and our faithfull Ministers. So
that, in this Case, it is not amisse (though <HI>Tullie</HI> deride it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. Te Di|uin. p. 263.</NOTE> as a kinde of mad|nesse)
<HI>ad aegros, non Medicos adducere&punc; sed Vates, &amp; Ariolos: to bring vnto the
Patient,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Kings, 20. 5. 7.</NOTE> <HI>not a Phisition, but a Prophet.</HI> For so did God himselfe vnto <HI>Heze|chiah,</HI>
in his sicknesse. He sent vnto him, not <HI>Medicum,</HI> but <HI>Vatem,</HI> the Pro|phet
<HI>Isay</HI> to visite him: by whom notwithstanding hee was both comforted,
and cured. Thus God (as I haue shewed you) is both the <HI>Giuer,</HI> and the
<HI>Restorer of Health;</HI> yea, and that oftentimes immediately of himselfe, with|out
all externall meanes: sending it downe sometime immediately out of
heauen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kings, 18. 36. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> by the only power of prayer, as he did <HI>Elias</HI> his fire. Thereby plainely
declaring, that it was both a false &amp; impious opinion, which was held by <HI>Leo|gorus:
Se fortuit&ograve; poti&ugrave;s, qu&agrave;m Dei voluntate, valetudinem recepisse:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suidas in voce <GAP DESC="foreign"> p. 278.</NOTE> <HI>That hee

that euen <HI>Pheraeus Iason</HI> recouered health,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. de Nat. Deor. p. 236.</NOTE> when his Enemy smiting him
chanc't, to breake his impostume. This was onely Gods blessing. Hee was his
Phisition.</P>
<P>4 Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God is the Giuer of all Medi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> vn|to Man.</NOTE> and so is he likewise vnto all other men, euen when they vse their
best meanes: because all the vertue of them is onely giuen by him. He it is,
that hath giuen all medicinall herbes and plants vnto man. He it is, that
<PB N="254" REF="134">
hath giuen the Art of the Phisition, and the skill how to vse them. And
hee it is, that onely giueth all the efficacie vnto them, by ioyning his blessing
with them. And all this is confessed, as well by the very heathens, as it is by
vs <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>For the first of which three points: that <HI>God is the giuer of all medicines vnto
Man;</HI> we see this by experience, that there is a sanatiue and medicinable power
giuen both vnto herbes, and vnto rootes, and vnto stones, and vnto mineralls;
yea and euen vnto diuers kinds of pure &amp; simple earths; called <HI>Terrae sigillatae,</HI>
because they be printed and sealed for diuers seuerall vses in mans sicknesses
and infirmities. With all which seuerall medicines the body of the earth is so
euery where replenished, yea and the sur-face of it so euery where ouer-strew|ed,
as if the whole earth were nothing else but a great <HI>bolus,</HI> or masse of soue|raigne
medicines, made vp, by God himselfe, for mans seuerall diseases.</P>
<P>Now the Question is, whence this healing virtue commeth, vnto all the
forenamed Simples? whether, from the qualitie of the earth, <HI>wherein</HI> they
grow? or, from the influence of the starres, <HI>whereby</HI> they grow? or, from
some inward nature in themselues? or, from fate? or, from chance? or, from
diuine prouidence? For, it needes must proceede from some one of these.
But that it cannot come from any one of the fiue first imaginary causes; it is
(by diuine prouidence) most euidently declared, in the <HI>Booke of Genesis:</HI>
Where, it is expresly testified (as it were for the preuenting of this fond opi|nion)
that <HI>God made euery plant of the field,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen 2. 5.</NOTE> <HI>before he put it into the Earth; and
euery h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rbe, before it grew.</HI> A worke of so great carefulnesse, as hee hath not
expressed in any other of his Creatures: man himselfe alone excepted. Now
this place dischargeth all those forenamed causes of doing any worke in
this notable effect. <HI>The Earth,</HI> that hath not giuen this virtue vnto plants: be|cause
they all were made before they were put into the Earth. <HI>The Starres,</HI>
they haue it not giuen vnto them: because all the plants were made before
them. For the plants of the Earth were made the third day: but the Pla|nets
of Heauen were not made before the fourth: no,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 12. 13. 14.</NOTE> nor the sixt Starres
neither, as appeareth in the Scripture. <HI>Their owne power and nature</HI> hath not
giuen it vnto them: because they had not their very being of themselues, but
receiued it of another, euen the Diuine <HI>Creator. Fate,</HI> that hath not giuen it
vnto them: because they alwayes possesse it not, neither worke, by necessity,
vnto their owne effect. <HI>Chance,</HI> that hath not giuen it vnto them: because
then, the remedies could not haue answered so aptly vnto the diseases, nor so
constantly, in all places. Now, if neither <HI>Earth,</HI> nor <HI>Heauen,</HI> nor <HI>Nature,</HI> nor
<HI>Fate,</HI> nor <HI>Fortune,</HI> haue giuen those qualities vnto <HI>Herbes,</HI> and <HI>Plants:</HI> then
must <HI>Prouidence</HI> needes haue done it. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 1. de Placit. c. 1. To. 2. p. 4.</NOTE> as <HI>Plutarch</HI> collecteth, in the very
like case, that, <HI>Omnia quaene&abque; fortuit&ograve; fiunt, ne&abque; necessari&ograve;, ne&abque; diuinit&ugrave;s, res
sunt naturales:</HI> so may we collect, from the very same diuision, vsing a little
inuersion: that, <HI>Quae ne&abque; fortuit&ograve; fiunt, ne&abque; necessari&ograve;, ne&abque; natur&acirc;, ea fiunt di|uinit&ugrave;s.
Those things, which are neither done by Fortune, nor by Fate, nor
by Nature, they must needs be done by Prouidence.</HI></P>
<P>And, for our present instance; that the virtues of herbes are giuen to them
by <HI>Prouidence,</HI> we may further collect, by two other Obseruations. The first
whereof, is this: That the body of a man is not subiect vnto any sicknesse,
<PB N="255" REF="134">
though neuer so dangerous, but that it hath some remedie prouided for it; if
man were as skilfull, in discerning of them as God hath beene bountifull, in
prouiding of them.</P>
<P>And therefore saith <HI>Bachiarius: Ab sit hoc a fide mea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bachiar. Epist. de lapsis, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. Pat. To. 1. p. 419 Ier. 9 22.</NOTE> <HI>vt aliquam dicam esse
plaga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e non haebeat consolationem: c&ugrave;m mihi Propheta proclamet: Nun|quid
Medicus non est in Galaath? aut resina non est ill&ugrave;c? Farre be it from
me to beleeue, that there can be any maladie, which hath not his remedie: seeing
that the Prophet calleth out vnto me; Is there no balme in Gilead? and is there
no Physition there?</HI> Whereby it appeareth, that those medicinall qualities
were bestowed vpon plants, by such a prouidence as was full of all goodnes,
entertayning a generall care for all of vs; yea and for euery disease that might
befall any of vs; that there shold not be any one, but that it had his medicine.</P>
<P>The second of those obseruations is this: That those medicinable plants
are so graciously disposed, in all the parts of the earth, that, as there is no
sicknesse, but it hath his redresse: so is there no place, but it may be found
in it: no region but it hath a naturall medicine, to cure euery sicknesse that
is naturally bred in it, if man, in his ignorance, did not mistake it. Yea and
that so vniuersally, that (as <HI>Plinie</HI> obserueth) <HI>Ne Syluae quidem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. l. 24. c. 1. p. 350.</NOTE> <HI>horridi&ograve;r&abque;

disponente homini. Euen the woods themselues, and the roughter face
of Nature, be not without their medicines; the holy Parent of all things pro|uiding
helps for men, in all coasts, and all places.</HI> Whereby againe it appea|reth,
that those Medicines were ordayned, by such a kind of Prouidence, as
both had infinite wisedome, to vnderstand, what medicines were fit, for
what diseases; and infinit power, to produce them, in all places. For, as <HI>Galen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. l. 3. de vsu partium.</NOTE>
no lesse religiously, then wisely, collecteth: <HI>Invidere nulli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> bona, est perfectae
bonitatis; invenire cunctis bona, est summae sapientiae; sed efficere cunctis bona,
est, insuperabilis potentiae. To enuie good to nothing, is a note of perfect good|nes;
To finde out good for all things, is a note of perfect wisedome; But to doe
good vnto all, is a note of perfect power.</HI> So that, as concerning those me|dicinable
plants, it is very true, which S. <HI>Basil</HI> obserueth, that, <HI>Non sponte sua
ex Tellure germinant Herbae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil, in Asceti|cis. To. 2. p. 291.</NOTE> <HI>quae contra quoscun&abque; morbos accommodae sunt:
sed, eae, voluntate Opificis, ad nostram vtilitatem productae sunt. Those Herbes
which men vse for the cure of all diseases, doe not grow out of the earth of them|selues:
but, by their Creators goodnesse, they were made to profit vs.</HI> And so
likewise <HI>Theodoret,</HI> vnto the same purpose: <HI>Creator rerum, Terram quo&abque;,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodoret. Serm 4. De Prouident. To. 2. p. 592.</NOTE>
<HI>multas Herbarum species, non advescendum mod&ograve;, sed &amp; eas, quae esui inuti|les

the Earth to produce all kinds of Herbes; not onely such herbes, as are
fit to be our meates; but also such Herbes, as be vnfit for that purpose: because
a man stands in need, as well of medicines, as of meates.</HI> So that, all kindes of
Herbes, with all their vertues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 38. 4.</NOTE> whether nutritiue, or sanatiue, they be onely
the gifts of God vnto Man: Who (as <HI>Ecclesiastic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> testifieth) <HI>hath created
all the Medicines of the Earth: and hee that is wise, will not abhorre them.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and euen the very Heathen confesse also the same. <HI>Tullie</HI> reckoneth
vp this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. De Nat. Deor. p. 221.</NOTE> as one of the greatest bounties of Nature, that there be, in all places
<PB N="256" REF="135">
great store of wholsome medicines: <HI>Medicamentorum salutarium plenissimae
Terrae.</HI> And <HI>Plinie</HI> speaking of simple medicines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin l. 24. Cap. 1. p. 350.</NOTE> referreth their frequencie
vnto Natures benignitie. <HI>Naturae placuit, esse remedia parata vulgo, inuentu
facilia, ac sine impendio. Nature hath prouided, that all her wholesome Me|dicines
should be ready at hand, easie to be found, and not deare to be purcha|sed.</HI>
Adding a little after, that, <HI>Remedia vera, pauperrimus quis&abque; coenat.
That the best, and truest Medicines, are euery day eaten, euen by poore men, in
their Suppers.</HI> As for exotick and compounded medicines; hee affirmeth, in
the same place, that they haue only beene i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uented by the fraud of Physitions,
rather to giue a false credit to their Art, then to bring any true benefit vn|to
their Patient.</P>
<P>Now, though both these two Authors, doe ascribe the making of those
plants vnto Nature: yet, vnder that word, they vnderstand God. When
they praise the benignitie &amp; bountie of Nature, for giuing such medicinable
plants vnto men, they doe meane, <HI>The diuine Nature.</HI> Or if they meane by
<HI>Nature,</HI> any setled and fixed order of generation; then, when they ascribe
those plants vnto <HI>Nature,</HI> they meane onely in respect of their present pro|pagation;
and not in respect of their first Creation. For, <HI>that</HI> themselues
confesse to be the worke of God: as <HI>Trismegistus</HI> expresly acknowledgeth;
<HI>Constat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lep. Cap. 13. p. 537.</NOTE> <HI>de Herbis, de Lapidibus, de Aromatibus, vim Diuinitatis naturalem in
se habere: It is certaine, both in Herbes, and in Stones, and in Spices, that
they haue a naturall force of Diuinitie in them.</HI> So that, it is so naturall,
that it is also diuine. It is naturall, in respect of their present propagation;
which holdeth a naturall course, in their generation; but it is supernaturall
and diuine, in respect of their first Creation. It is so, <HI>Vis naturalis;</HI> that it is
also, <HI>Vis Divinitatis;</HI> as he plainely there affirmeth.</P>
<P>5 And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God is the Gi|uer of all skill in Physick.</NOTE> as the Heathen acknowledge, that medicinable Qualities are gi|uen
vnto plants; and plants, with their Qualities, are giuen vnto men, only
by the gift of God: so doe they also confesse, that the finding out of those
Qualities in them, and the skill how to vse them, is onely the worke of his
goodnesse vnto man, and not the effect of Mans owne invention. <HI>Mirari li|cet</HI>
(saith <HI>Tullie) quae sint animaduersa a Medicis Herbarum genera,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. lib. 1. Dedi|u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">a. p. 242.</NOTE> <HI>quae Radi|cum&punc;
ad morsus bestiarum, ad oculorum morbos, ad vulnera: quorum vim at&abque;
naturam ratio nunqu&agrave;m explicavit. It is a wonder to consider, how many sorts
of Herbes, and how many kindes of Rootes are obserued by Physitions for the
biting of Serpents, or other hurtfull Beasts, the diseases of the Eyes, and the
healing vp of wounds. The nature and power of all which seuerall plants is so
infinite an inuention, as could neuer haue beene found out by Mans wit and
reason.</HI> Now if the wit of man could not finde out this great secret: what
was it then, that hath found it out? Surely nothing else, but a diuine illumi|nation,
and inspiration of God. And this, euen the Heathen themselues haue
confessed. <HI>Deorum fuisse apparet</HI> (saith <HI>Plinie) aut cert&egrave; divinum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. lib. 27. cap. 1. p. 387.</NOTE> <HI>etiam c&ugrave;m
Homo inveniet. It is apparent that this was Gods inuention, or, at the least, that
it was a diuine inuention, euen though it were inuented and found out by man:</HI>
But he resolueth, that this is so high a skill and vnderstanding, as was rather
giuen by God, then euer found by man. <HI>Eandem omnium parentem, &amp; ge|nuisse
hac, &amp; ostendisse, nullo vitae miraculo maiore, si verum fateri volumus.
<PB N="257" REF="135">
That vniuersall Parent and Creator of all things, who first created those Me|dicines
for man, hath also declared the vse of them vnto him. A thing most
strange and miraculous, if we will confesse the truth.</HI> And, a little before, hee
rendereth a reason, why the knowledge of those things must needs be rather
the teaching of God, then the inuention of man. Because, if God hath on|ly
giuen those virtues vnto plants; and man, without God, hath found them
out; man hath done the greater worke, and God the lesse: <HI>Superata hoc modo
videri posset naturae ipsius munificentia, si humani operis esset inuentio.</HI> And
therefore, a little after, hee concludeth, that, <HI>Si quis illa fort&egrave; ab homine exco|gitari
posse credit, ingrat&egrave; Deorum manera intelligit: If any man do thinke, that
such things could haue bene found by the wit and reach of man, hee is an vn|thankfull
interpreter of the gracious gift of God.</HI> Vnto whom <HI>Homer</HI> also as|cribeth
this blessing, that for all kind of Medicines, it is onely hee that posses|seth
them:

<L>God only hath the remedie,</L>
<L>For euery kinde of malady.</L></Q>
And thus, euen the very Heathens themselues do expresly acknowledge, both
the plants themselues to be the workes of God, and the knowledge of their
vses to be the gift of God.</P>
<P>Neither stay they only heere, in this particular branch of Phisicke; but
they acknowledge the whole Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coel. Rhodig. l. 29. c. 11. p. 1353.</NOTE> to be the gift of God. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> affirmeth
it, in expresse and plaine words; <HI>Medicam facultatem Deorum esse munus.</HI>
And so <HI>Tully</HI> likewise:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de Di|uin. p. 142.</NOTE> <HI>Medicinae vtilitas Deorum immortalium inuentioni est
consecrata. The Art of Phisicke, is of so great a profit, that the inuention of it,
is ascribed vnto God.</HI> So <HI>Plinie: Dijs inuentores suos assignauit.</HI> Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. l 29. c. 1. p. 416.</NOTE> and it
is expresly affirmed by <HI>Homer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de Homero. To. 11 p. 145.</NOTE> to bee both <HI>a diuine Science, and greater then
any other.</HI>
<Q><L>Ast, Medicum, reliquis diuina scientia, maior</L>
<L>Instruit.</L></Q>
Yea, and <HI>Apollo,</HI> one of their chiefest gods, doth boast of this inuention to
be his,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d, l. 1. Me|tam. p. 39.</NOTE> and none others.
<Q><L>Inuentum Medicina meum est, opifer&abque; per Orbem</L>
<L>Dicor: &amp; Herbarum est subiecta scientia nobis.</L>
<L>The Art of Phisicke, it is mine</L>
<L>Inuention, and an Art Diuine.</L>
<L>And I am call'd, the World all o're,</L>
<L>The common Helper of their sore.</L>
<L>The Nature of all Plants is knowne</L>
<L>Only to Me, it is mine owne.</L></Q>
And therefore they called <HI>Apollo, Vlion, Salutiferum,</HI> and <HI>Artemidem; ex eo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, l. 14. p. 347.</NOTE>
<HI>qu&ograve;d integros faceret,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> reporteth: <HI>because he made men whole.</HI> But
<HI>Plutarch</HI> reduceth this Art, a great deale higher, referring it, not to <HI>Apollo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. contra St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">icos, To. 3. p. 566.</NOTE>
but euen vnto <HI>Iupiter,</HI> or if there be any God, who is greater. For hee con|demneth
it, as one of the greatest absurdities of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> that they do as|cribe
this Art, vnto any of the petty and inferior gods, and not rather vnto
him, that is the chiefest of them. Wherein hee erred not. For it is, indeede,
<PB N="258" REF="136">
the gift of the greatest God. <HI>It is hee</HI> (saith Ecclesiasticus) <HI>that hath giuen
men this knowledge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus 38. 6.</NOTE> <HI>that he might be glorified,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus 38. 1.</NOTE> <HI>in his wondrous workes.</HI> And
therefore he exhorteth vs, <HI>To honour the Phisition, because of necessitie.</HI> Ad|ding
there this reason: <HI>For the Lord hath created him.</HI> He hath created him;
not onely as he is a man; but also as he is a Phisition. As it is expresly testi|fied,
by Saint <HI>Augustine. Illa corporis medicina <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">on inuenitur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. l. 1. de Mo|ribus Eccles. c. 28. To. 1. p. 738.</NOTE> <HI>vnde ad Homi|nes
manare potuerit, nisi a Deo: Cuirerum omnium status salus&abque; tribuenda est.
It cannot bee found out, from whence the Art of Phisicke should come
vnto men, but onely from God: vnto whom the health and safetie of all
things ought to be ascribed. So Basil: Ars medica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil. in As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">, To. 2. p. 291. Theodoret.

concessa est. The Arte of Phisicke is giuen vs of God who onely ruleth
our whole life.</HI> So <HI>Theodoret: Quia Deus, qui te mortalem in hac vita condi|dit,
sciuit, te morbis quo&abque; exercendum fore, simul medicam artem te docuit:
cuius scientiam morborum incur sionibus opposuit. Because God, who made man
mortall in this present life, foresaw, that he needs must be exercised with sick|nesses,
he therefore taught him the Arte of Phisicke: opposing that knowledge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephraem Syrus, Serm. de Fide, p. 81.</NOTE>
<HI>against the assaults of all kindes of diseases.</HI> And so likewise <HI>Ephra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m Syrus,</HI>
comprehending in one sentence both these last fore-named points; <HI>Deus,
Herbas, &amp; Terrae pharmaca, &amp; Medicorum studia, ad morbos corperis curandos
concessit: God hath giuen vs, both Herbes, and other wholsome Medicines; and
beside, both the study, and skill of Phisitions, to cure all the maladies, and disea|ses
of our bodies.</HI> So that, it is onely hee, which hath giuen both all medici|nable
plants vnto the Earth, and all skill to the Phisition, in what manner to
vse them. And thus, both the Heathens, and Christians agree, that both the
Phisicke, and the Phisition, are the onely gifts of God, for the health, and
good of man.</P>
<P>6 But yet, neither of both these can doe any good vnto him, if they bee
not assisted with Gods speciall blessing. For first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods blessing is it, that hea|leth, more then the Me|dicine.</NOTE> for the Phisition: that it is
not in his power, with all his skill, to make any sicke-man whole; we may see
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">on. 16. 12.</NOTE> in the old Testament, by the example of King <HI>Asa:</HI> whose <HI>too great</HI> confi|dence
in his Phisitions, and <HI>too little</HI> in his God, was that which brought him
vnto his end. And the same we may likewise see,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 5. 25, 26.</NOTE> in the new, in the woman dis|eased
with the bloody issue: Of whom it is testified, that though shee had
suffered many things from her Phisitions, and continued long with them, and
vsed great change of them, and spent all she had vpon them; yet was she ne|uer
the better for them, but rather much the worse. And the like is also re|ported
of the Emperor <HI>Adrian;</HI> that hee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dion Cassius in Hadriano. p. 135.</NOTE> at his death, was forced to com|plaine,
that, <HI>Turba Medicorum interfecit Regem: The multitude of Phisitions
had brought the Emperour vnto his death.</HI> Whereby it appeareth, that no
Phisition hath power to heale any man, if God do not giue a special blessing
vnto him. As the Philosopher <HI>Taurus</HI> insinuated to that Phisition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. Gel. lib. 18. cap. 9. p. 263.</NOTE> that came
to heale <HI>A: Gellius. Cum Dijs bene volentibus, opera tua, sistas hunc nobis
sanum.</HI> Implying, that his labour and Gods blessing must worke both together,
before the sick-man could recouer. For, as <HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI> expresly testifieth, <HI>Nei|ther
the Apothecary can finish his owne worke, in making of the Medicine; nor
yet the phisition, his, in applying of the medicine; if they be not assisted, with Gods
speciall blessing. The Apothecarie</HI> (saith he) <HI>doth make a confection: and yet he
<PB N="259" REF="136">
cannot finish his owne worke. For of the Lord commeth prosperitie, and wealth,
ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r all the Earth.</HI> Then he commeth from him, vnto the Phisition: <HI>Giue place to
the Phisition,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus 38. 8. 12. 13. 14.</NOTE> <HI>for the Lord hath created him. Let him not go from thee: for thou
hast neede of him.</HI> But what? can he heale thee when he list? No. But he addeth:
<HI>The houre may come, that their enterprises may haue good successe.</HI> But how? He
addeth further: <HI>For they shall pray vnto the Lord, that he would prosper that
which is giuen for ease; and their Physick, for the prolonging of life.</HI> So then
the Physition toucheth: but it is God that healeth. There is greater effica|cie
vnto health, in the Physitions prayer, then there is in his power: the
whole prosperitie of the medicine depending vpon Gods blessing. And
therefore saith S. <HI>Hierom:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hier. in. cap. 26. Isai. To. 5. p. 110.</NOTE> <HI>De omni infirmitate dicendum est, qu&ograve;d abs&abque; mise|ricordia
Dei, medendi ars nihil valeat. In all a mans infirmities, without Gods
speciall goodnesse, the arte of the Physitions is of very little worth.</HI> And in an|other
place, he confirmes his owne assertion, by the fore-named instance,
of the diseased woman.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hier. in cap. 7. Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s To. 6. 124.</NOTE> <HI>Quis Medicorum sanare <GAP DESC="foreign"> potuit, nisi tu

Physitions could heale that diseased woman, but onely thou alone? Who wast
able to restore her health vnto her, by touching, but onely, the hemme of thy
vesture.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and the same Father againe reporteth of <HI>Hilarion:</HI> that, when
a like diseased woman was brought vnto him, desiring to be cured, and com|playning
that no Physick could doe her any good, that holy Father replyed:
<HI>Si quae in Medicis perdidisti, Pauperibus dedisses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hier. in vita Hi|lar. To. 1. p. 144.</NOTE> <HI>curasset te verus Medicus
Iesus: If that, which thou hast lost vpon thy Physitions, thou hadst bestowed vp|on
poore and needy persons, Iesus Christ, the true Physition, would haue cured
thee long agone.</HI> And therefore S. <HI>Basil</HI> hath giuen vs a good <HI>Caueat:</HI> not to
repose so strong a confidence in any kind of Physicke, be it neuer so good;
because all is but weake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Basil. in Ascetici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> To. 2. p. 291.</NOTE> without the blessing of God. <HI>Satagendum est, vt
h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">c Arte, si quand&ograve; illa opus est, ita vtamur, vt non omnem illi causam sanita|tis
ascribamus. We must take heed, that when we vse the</HI> helpe <HI>of Physick; yet
that we ascribe not all our</HI> health <HI>vnto it.</HI> For, as hee addeth a little after:
<HI>Irrationale est,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 292.</NOTE> <HI>propriae salutis spem in manus ponere Medicorum. It is against
all reason, to put all the hope of our health in the hand of the Physition;</HI> who
hath it not in his hand: as before I haue shewed.</P>
<P>And, as it is not in the Arte of the <HI>Physition</HI> to giue health vnto the
sicke-man: so is it not also in the power of any <HI>Medicine.</HI> For, as it is af|firmed
in the Booke of <HI>Wisedome</HI> (speaking of those <HI>Israelites</HI> that were stong
and bitten by the firie Serpents) It <HI>was neither Herbe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wis. 16. 12.</NOTE> <HI>nor Plaister that healed
them, but the word of the Lord, that healeth all things.</HI> Nay, it was not the
<HI>Brazen Serpent</HI> that healed them, though for that very purpose it was speci|ally
appointed; but it was only God himselfe that healed them by it, as is ex|presly
there affirmed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wise. 16. 7.</NOTE> <HI>He that turned towards it, was not healed by that thing
which he saw, but by thee, &ocirc; Sauiour of all.</HI> Whereby it appeareth, that it is
not the outward medicine, but the inward blessing, that healeth. And that,
as S. <HI>Augustine</HI> obserueth, our health commeth vnto vs, onely from God,
the Creator:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug in. Psal. 34. To. 8. p. 250.</NOTE> euen then, when we receiue it, by meanes of the Creature. <HI>De

profit none but those, vnto whom God himselfe doth worke, for their health.

Medicine, or without the medicine. For, <HI>All health is of him;</HI> as is testified in

doth this happen rather vnto the principals, then it doth vnto others? It
appeareth in <HI>Plutarch,</HI> to be an old conceit, to attribute this to <HI>Fate,</HI> and to
a kind of <HI>Destinie</HI> bestowed vpon those Cities, in their genethliacks, and na|tiuities,
by the aspects and positure of the Stars.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in Vita Romuli. p. 52.</NOTE> But this the Psalmist re|iecteth,

from the East, nor from the West, nor from the North, nor from the South.</HI>
It commeth not from the <HI>East,</HI> from whence the Stars doe come in their
diurnall motion: nor yet from the <HI>West,</HI> from whence they come againe in
their naturall motion: nor yet from <HI>North,</HI> or <HI>South,</HI> from whence they goe

of all these motions doth <HI>Promotion</HI> come. But (as it followeth in that
Psalme) <HI>It is God, that is the Iudge; hee putteth downe one, and setteth vp ano|ther.</HI>
And this is true, as well in the fortunes of Cities, and Nations, as of
particular persons. As wee may euidently see in the prophecy of <HI>Isaiah. Be|hold</HI>
(saith he) <HI>it is the Lord that maketh the earth empty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 24. 1.</NOTE> <HI>and he maketh it waste;

fortune vnto Cities: and reckoneth it among the number of Fables. Yea,
and that very worthily. For, if it were fatall for those Cities to rise, how come
they to their fall? Is there now crept in a mutabilitie into <HI>Fate?</HI> Is it now be|come
contrarie vnto it selfe; to depresse the same thing, which before it selfe

done now of late, and things done long agone, are subiect vnto Fortune: she
drawing all things after her, at her owne will and pleasure.</HI> And hee giueth, in
that place, diuers fit and pregnant instances, as well in the rising, as falling of
Cities. For the rising of them, hee there nameth <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and <HI>Seleucia,</HI>
of whom hee affirmeth, that, <HI>Ideo ad tantam magnitudinem &amp; felicita|tem

they therefore grew vnto such greatnes and felicitie, because Fortune led them
to it, as it were, by the hand.</HI> In the falling of Cities, he nameth these before
mentioned, of <HI>Thebes, My<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">enae, Delus, Babilon,</HI> and the rest: of whom hee
addeth this Conclusion, <HI>that they all were destroyed, by the iniquitie of Fortune:
<PB N="264" REF="139">

But, that herein hee is deceiued, it appeareth by this argument: That both
the rising, and falling of many Cities, haue beene truely and certainely fore|told:
Which they could not haue beene, if it had beene by Fortune. For,
these things which are fortuitous, cannot be foreseene by <HI>Prouidence:</HI> &amp;
therefore not foretold. Who can foretell, that at such a time, such a man shall
haue a fall? No more could any man foretell, that at such a time such a king|dome

that both the rising of some Cities, and the falling of others, haue bin
certainly foretold, by diuers of the Prophets.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 2. 31. &amp;c.</NOTE> The Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> not on|ly
foretelleth, both the rising, and the falling, of the foure grand Monarchies;

<HI>Image;</HI> the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 73 &amp;c.</NOTE> of the foure fearefull <HI>Beasts.</HI> Yea, and in the transla|tion
and succession of those Monarchies, he plainely describeth the falling of
one of them, and the rising of another, vnder the figure of a <HI>Battell,</HI> betweene
a <HI>Ramme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 8. 3, &amp;c.</NOTE> and a <HI>Goate:</HI> wherein the <HI>Goate</HI> preuayled. Which <HI>Goate,</HI> he there
affirmeth, to be the <HI>King of the Graecians;</HI> as he doth the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mme,</HI> to be the
<HI>King of the Persians.</HI> Where, if the euent had fallen out contrary vnto his
praediction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 8 20. 21.</NOTE> he being so definite, and confident in his asseueration, hee had
beene vtterly shamed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 18. 21. 22.</NOTE> and had iustly incurred the note <HI>of a false Prophet.</HI>
But he knew whom <HI>he beleeued,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. 1. 12.</NOTE> and that hee could not be deceiued: because
these things were by God himselfe reuealed; by whom they were both fore-knowne,
and fore-appointed. So likewise, the Prophet <HI>Ionas,</HI> in his foretelling
of the destruction of <HI>Niniveh,</HI> was as definite and peremptorie in appointing
the certaine dayes, as <HI>Daniel</HI> was before, in naming the certaine Nations. <HI>Yet
forty dayes and Niniveh shall be destroyed.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ionah. 3. 4.</NOTE> Which finall destruction (though
the meanes be vnknowne) yet had certainely happened, if by their earnest re|pentance,
it had not beene auerted.</P>
<P>Another like destruction, there is also foretold, by the Prophet <HI>Balaam;</HI>
to happen from the <HI>Grecians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 24. 24.</NOTE> or <HI>Romans,</HI> vnto the Kingdome both of the <HI>As|syrians,</HI>
and of the <HI>Hebrewes. The Ships shall come from the Coasts of Chittim
and shall subdue Assur, and shall subdue Heber, &amp; he also shall come to destructi|on.</HI>
A very true prophecie, though vttered by a false Prophet. For, whether we
take <HI>Chittim</HI> for the <HI>Greeks,</HI> or the <HI>Romans,</HI> (as it is sometimes for both,) by
those two Nations, were those two Kingdomes subdued; and the latter of
those Kingdomes, by the latter of those Nations, was not onely subdued, but
also subuerted, according to the prophecie in that place deliuered. Now
these things could not haue beene thus certainely foreshewne, if they had not
beene as certainely foreseene. And that they could not haue beene, if they had
fallen out by <HI>Fortune.</HI> So that, as concerning <HI>Fate; Solon</HI> excludeth that,

Romae iecit Tempus cum Deo: That the Foundation of Rome was layd by God
and Time.</HI> It was layd by God, to continue for a long time, as he wittily there
expresseth, by this fit deuice and fiction: <HI>That Fortune quickly flew ouer both
the Persians, and Assyrians, and Macedonians, and Aegyptians, and Syrians, and
Carthaginians: but, when shee came vnto the Romanes, she then put off her
wings, as purposing to stay with them, and not to fly from them.</HI> So that God
gaue them their beginning, in laying their foundation: and hee vpheld their
continuing; in giuen to them <HI>Time.</HI> This is <HI>Plutarchs</HI> iudgement of them.
Yea, and <HI>Tully</HI> likewise ascribeth all the <HI>Romane</HI> greatnesse, vnto none other
cause, but onely to the bounty and goodnesse of their gods. <HI>Quis est tam
vecors, qui, c&ugrave;m Deos esse intellexerit, non intelligat, eorum numine, hoc tantum
imperium esse natum, &amp; auctum, &amp; retentum? Who is there so mad, but knowing
there is a God, he must also vnderstand, that by his speciall goodnesse, the great
Empire of the Romanes is both founded, and increased, and continued?</HI> Yea,
and in the same place hee ascribeth the dilatation of their Empire, rather vn|to
their religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Orat. de Arusp. Respons. p. 405.</NOTE> then either vnto their valour, or vnto their wisdome. <HI>Nec nu|mero,
Hispanos; nec robore, Gallos; nec calliditate, Poenos; nec artihus, Graecos; nec

haue not ouercom the Spaniards, by our number; nor the French, by our power; nor
the Carthaginians, by our pollices; nor the Graecians, by our Arts; nor the Italians,
or Latines, by the naturall sharpenesse, and finenesse of our wits: but it is only our
pietie, and religion, and this speciall wisedome of ascribing all things to the go|uernement
of the gods, that hath subdued vnto vs so many Countries, and Na|tions.</HI>
Thereby plainely insinuating, that the greatnesse of their Empire was
bestowed by God vpon them, onely as a reward of their pietie, and religion.
Which <HI>Caecilius</HI> also expresly confirmeth. For he saith of the <HI>Romanes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arnob. l. 8. cont. Gent. p. 746.</NOTE> that,
<HI>Imperium suum, vltra Solis vias, &amp; ipsius Oceani limites, progag&acirc;runt, d&ugrave;m ex|ercent
in armis virtutem religiosam: The exercise of vertue, and of Religion,
<PB N="267" REF="140">
was that which inlarged the Romane dominion.</HI> For (as he addeth a litle after)
<HI>Dum vniversarum Gentium sacra suscipiunt, etiam Regna meruerunt. While they
receiue the Religions of all Nations, they deserue also their Dominions.</HI> This he
falsly ascribeth vnto their false religion: which yet may truly be ascribed vnto
the true one. And <HI>Camillus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Liv. l. 5. p. 103.</NOTE> in his Oration recorded by <HI>Liuie,</HI> expresly affir|meth,
that <HI>al the calamities of the Romans sprung only from ther offences against
God; as, on the contrary, all their prosperity grew only from their piety.</HI> Which is
true, in very deed, if it be rightly vnderstood, and be referred, as it ought, vn|to
to the true God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 10. 22.</NOTE> For (as <HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI> very truely affirmeth) <HI>It is the feare of
the Lord, which causeth, that the Kingdome faileth not: but a Kingdome is lost,
by crueltie and pride.</HI> And therefore King <HI>Ochus,</HI> being asked by his sonne,
by what meanes he had preserued his kingdome so long? answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atheneus. l. 12. p. 407.</NOTE> That this
was done, <HI>Pietate, in Deos; et iustitia, in Homines: By his Pietie, towards God;
and his aequitie, towards men.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 36. 17.</NOTE> For (as <HI>Elihu</HI> truely telleth vs) <HI>Iudgment and

and ouerthrowne by wickednesse (as <HI>Ecclesiastcus</HI>) obserueth <HI>Because
of vnrighteous dealing, and wrongs, and riches gotten by deceit, the Kingdome is
translated from one people to another.</HI> So that, as King <HI>Salomon</HI> himselfe in
another place affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 14. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Iustice exalteth a nation: but sinne bringeth a people
to confusion.</HI> A notable example whereof, God himselfe hath left vnto vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 25. 12.</NOTE> in
the <HI>Babilonians:</HI> whose kingdome and Nation hee professeth that hee will
bring vnto vtter desolation, for their sinnes and iniquities. And this we may
obserue to haue beene a strong notion, very deepely imprinted in the mindes
euen of the Heathens: <HI>That, as nothing praeserueth Kingdomes more firmely,
then vertue;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Au. Gell. l. 20. c. 1 p. 281.</NOTE> <HI>so nothing destroyeth them more certainly, then vice. A. Gellius</HI>
ascribeth the rising of the <HI>Romans</HI> onely vnto their vertues. <HI>Omnibus virtu|tum
ganeribus exercendis, colendis&abque;, Populus Romanus, &egrave; parua origine, ad tantae
megnitudinis instar emicuit. The Romans</HI> (saith he) <HI>ascended from their low and
meane beginnings, to such an height of greatnes, only by their practice of all kind
of vertues.</HI> And <HI>Tullie</HI> on the contrarie, he saith: <HI>They lost their greatnes</HI> by
degenerating from their ancient vertue vnto vice, in the fore-alledged place:
<HI>Nostris vitijs, non casu aliquo, Rempub. amisimus; It is not by chance, but it is by
our vice, whereby we haue decayed and lost our common-wealth.</HI> And therefore
in the same place, he pronounceth, that, There is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. in Fragmen|tis. To. 4. p. 298. 297.</NOTE> <HI>Nihil tam inimicum Ciuitati,
qu&agrave;m iniustitia; quae, sine magnae iustitia, nec geri, nec stare potest. That there
is no such Enemie vnto any Citie, as iniustice is, and iniurie: because, without
great Iustice, there cannot any Citie be either well gouerned, or safely praeserued.</HI>
For, as the Tragicall Poet hath very truely noted:
<Q><L>&mdash;Vbi non est pudor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. in Thyes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e Act. 2. Sce. 1. p 296.</NOTE></L>

<L>Where is nor modestie, nor equitie, nor sanctitie,</L>
<L>No pietie, no veritie, no, nor civilitie,</L>
<L>In such a Kingdome, certainly,</L>
<L>There can be no stabilitie.</L></Q>
Which sentence of the Tragick, is also confirmed, by another of the Comick:
<PB N="268" REF="141">

Now, this consent of the Heathen, in thus generally ascribing the rising of
Cities and Commonwealths, vnto vertue; and their falling, vnto vice; im|plyeth,
that they beleeued, that God is the Author and worker of
both these. Because hee is the Rewarder of vertues, and the punisher
of vices: who for the transgressions and wickednesse of men, both abateth
and abaseth, and transformeth, and transferreth all their Kingdomes and
Commonwealths, as hee himselfe pleaseth. Of all which, the Holy Scriptures
haue left vs euident examples.</P>
<P>He abated the Kingdome of the <HI>Israelites;</HI> when hee tooke from <HI>Reho|boram,</HI>
ten of the twelue tribes, and bestowed them vpon <HI>Ieroboam.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kings, 12. 16, 17.</NOTE> He aba|sed
the Kingdome of the <HI>Caldeans;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay. 47, 1.</NOTE> when hee called vnto <HI>Babel,</HI> to come
and sit downe <HI>in the dust:</HI> and draue out their proud King from the compa|ny
of men, compelling him to liue among the brute Beasts: And all that, to
teach him but this very lesson, which I now am in prouing: <HI>That the most
High bereth rule ouer the Kingdomes of men, and that he disposeth them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel, 4. 22.</NOTE> <HI>as it
seemeth best vnto him.</HI> Hee transformed the Kingdome of the <HI>Israelites;</HI>
when hee changed it from their Iudges, vnto their Kings: as hee likewise did
the <HI>Romanes,</HI> from their <HI>Consuls,</HI> vnto their <HI>Emperours.</HI> In which change of
that State, it is worthy obseruation, which is written by <HI>Plutarch: That God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutach, in vita Bruti. p. 863.</NOTE>
<HI>determining to alter the Commonwealth of the Romanes, from their Optima|cie,
to a Monarchie;</HI> hee purposely suffered <HI>Brutus</HI> to bee ouerthrowne by
<HI>Octauius,</HI> lest hee should bee a meane to ouerthrow that gouernment, which
God then determined to set vp, hee being a knowne Enemie vnto the state of
a Monarchie.</P>
<P>And finally, he transferred them; the kingdomes of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> vnto
the <HI>Israelites;</HI> of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> vnto the <HI>Caldeans;</HI> of the <HI>Caldeans,</HI> vnto the
<HI>Medes,</HI> and <HI>Persians;</HI> of the <HI>Persians,</HI> vnto the <HI>Graecians;</HI> and of the <HI>Graecians,</HI>
vnto the <HI>Romanes.</HI> All which, haue, in the Scripture, their particular testimo|nies,
to be the workes of none other, but onely of God himselfe: who (as <HI>Iob</HI>
affirmeth in his booke) <HI>both looseth the Collar of Kings, aud girdeth their
loynes with a girdle; both increaseth the People, and destroyeth them;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob, 12. 18.</NOTE> <HI>both in|largeth
the Nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 12. 2.</NOTE> and bringeth them in againe.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel, 2. 21.</NOTE> And (as <HI>Daniel</HI> addeth, vnto
the same purpose) <HI>He both setteth vp Kings, and taketh away Kings.</HI> So that
(as <HI>Tertullian</HI> well collecteth) <HI>Ille Regna dispensat, cuius est &amp; orbis qui regna|tur,
&amp; Homo ipse qui regnat.&mdash;Ille Ciuitates extollit, &amp; deprimit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ge. c. 26. p. 57.</NOTE> <HI>sub quo

whose both the World is that is ruled, and the Men that rule it. He both exalteth
and depresseth Cities, whose Subiects men were, before they had any Cities.</HI> And
this was vnderstood, euen of the very Heathen: as we may gather out of that
prayer, which King <HI>Darius</HI> made, before his battaile with great <HI>Alexander:</HI>
which <HI>Plutarch</HI> thus reporteth. <HI>Dij natales, at&abque; regij, id prim&ugrave;m vos precor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vita <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> p. 562.</NOTE>

of the Persians vnto my Successors, which from you I receiued by my Predeces|sors;
that so I may repay vnto Alexander, those great benefits and fauours,
which, in this time of my calamitie, hee hath royally bestowed vpon my dearest
friends. But, if the fatall period of time bee now come, wherein the Persians
Kingdome must needes change, and be vndone; then againe I beseech you, that
the succession of King Cyrus his Throne may fall vnto King Alexander, and vn|to
none other.</HI> In which prayer it appeareth, that he verily beleeued, as well the
preseruation, as translation of Kingdomes, to be seated in the power of God.</P>
<P>So that, for this point, of the rising and falling of Kingdomes and Com|monwealths;
it seemeth vtterly absurd, not onely to the religion of well be|leeuing
Christians, but also to the reason of vnderstanding Heathens, to re|ferre
and ascribe it vnto any other cause, then onely to Gods prouidence. Es|pecially
not to chance. For, can wee thinke, that that prouidence, which is
so precisely curious, as to marke and obserue the falling of <HI>Sparrowes,</HI> should
bee so supinely incurious, as to slight and neglect the falling of Kingdomes?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mathew, 10. 29.</NOTE>
This were absurd to thinke. For; (as Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> collecteth from diuers
other the like workes of prouidence:) <HI>Qui non sol&ugrave;m Angelum, &amp; Hominem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. l. 5. de Ciuit. Dei c. 11. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 5. p. 303.</NOTE>

entraills of the least and most contemptible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">east, the feather of euery Bird,
the flower of euery Herbe, and the leafe of euery Plant; cannot in any wise bee
thought, to leaue without the lawes and compasse of his prouidence, the domini|ons,
and slaueries of Kingdomes, and Commonwealths.</HI></P>
<P>5 And this may further be seene, by an other obseruation: that God hath
incompassed al the Kingdomes of the earth with a threefold restraint; to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God limiteth the power of all Kings and Kingdomes.</NOTE> a
limitation of their powers; a circumscription of their bounds; &amp; a prefinition
of their periods. There was neuer, as yet, any kingdome in the world; which ei|ther
for his power, was illimitable; or, for his place, vniuersall; or, for his time,
perpetuall. But, God, in his prouidence, hath so incompassed all of them, that
euermore their powers, haue bin reduced vnto measures; their dominio~s, vnto
bounds; &amp; their co~tinuance, vnto periods. As we may see, by plaine examples
in the holy Scriptures. And first, as concerning the restraint of their powers:
that may euidently bee shewed, in three Easterne Kings. The first of whom,
is <HI>Saul:</HI> who pursued the Prophet <HI>Dauid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Samuel, 26. 20. 21.</NOTE> with such implacable hatred, that he
hunted him in all places, <HI>as a Partrich in the wildernes.</HI> And yet, when he offe|red
himselfe into his hands, hee had no power to hurt him; but (as <HI>Esau</HI> in the
like case pursuing his brother <HI>Iacob</HI>) though he came out against him with a
purpose to kill him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 32. 6 7.</NOTE> yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 33. 4.</NOTE> contrary vnto his purpose, he both louingly &amp; humbly
reconciled himselfe vnto him. So that, it might be said, as it is in the Tragicke:
<Q><PB N="271" REF="142">
<L>Otium &egrave; tanto subitum tumultu</L>
<L>Quis Deus fecit?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Thy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st. Act. 3. Sce. 3. p. 3. p. 309.</NOTE></L>
<L>What God, so soone, so great a calme</L>
<L>Could bring, from out so great a storme?</L></Q>
Surely euen the same God, who, (as a King testifieth) <HI>hath the hearts
of all Kings in his hand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 21. 1.</NOTE> <HI>and who turneth them, like riuers of waters, whither
hee thinketh good.</HI> He it was, that so restrayned the power of this wicked

to doe his Prophet any harme.</HI></P>
<P>The second of those kings, is <HI>Nebuchadnezzer:</HI> who was so vainely in|flated,
with the conceit of his owne power, that hee commanded his Cap|taines
to goe fortn, and to see him auenged vpon all the earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudith 2. 1. 3, 7.</NOTE> to fill all the
face of the earth with his Armies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudith 3. 8.</NOTE> and to destroy all flesh that obeyed not
his commandements: yea to destroy all the gods of all other Nations, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d
to set vp him to be worshipped for the God of the whole world. And thus
he proiected to extend his owne power, beyond all due measure, and to
aduance his owne honour aboue humane Nature. So that (as the Heathen
Poet speaketh) he did
<Q><L>Coelum ipsum petere stultiti&acirc;.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horat. l 1 Carm O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 3. p. 7.</NOTE></L>
<L>He sought, in his deepe foolishnes,</L>
<L>To climbe into Heauens Holinesse.</L></Q>
But, what was the euent of this his proud conceit? Surely this his exorbi|tant
and vnmeasurable ambition, and impotent desire of inlardging his
power, beyond humane condition, was, by a superior power, restrained, and
himselfe of all vaine purposes defeated. His Captaines were destroyed, his
armie dispersed: His honour blemished, by the hand of a woman. Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iud. 14. 18.</NOTE>
and euen his owne person was banished from among the societie of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iud. 15. 2. &amp;c.</NOTE> and

(as euen hee himselfe confessed) <HI>did fall out vnto him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 4. 31. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>by the appointment
of God.</HI></P>
<P>The third, and the last of these Kings, is <HI>Senaherib;</HI> propounding vnto
himselfe the like amplification of his power and dominion, fell himselfe into
the like, or a greater confusion. For he sending out all his warlike forces and
powers to the siege of <HI>Ierusalem;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. King. 18. 17. 33. 34. 35. 29.</NOTE> and there, by the mouth of his <HI>grandilo|quus

the very God of Heauen: when he had euen deuoured that king|dome

himselfe <HI>putteth his hooke into the nose of that Lion, and brought him backe a|gaine

the attempts of these three proud kings; curtailling their power, and restray|ning
their ambition; and thereby euidently shewing them, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 6. 27.</NOTE> as <HI>No man

Much lesse to any man, whose largest dominion cannot reach beyond the

Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Egesip. l. 2. de Excid. o Hieros. p. 244.</NOTE> and (as <HI>Egesippus</HI> recordeth) there were many, that thought the <HI>Romane
Empire</HI> so great, and so largely diffused ouer the face of the whole Earth, that
they called, <HI>Orbem Terrarum, Orbem Romanum:</HI> they called, <HI>the Globe of the
Earth, the Globe of the Romanes; the whole world, the Romane World.</HI> And the
same follie, which possessed the <HI>Romanes</HI> for their power, possessed also the
other <HI>Monarchs</HI> for theirs. <HI>Nebuchadnezzer</HI> the <HI>Monarch</HI> of the <HI>Caldeans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel, 3. 31. 2. 38.</NOTE>
conceited, that hee had vnder him, <HI>all nations, and languages.</HI> And <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the
<HI>Monarch</HI> of the <HI>Persians,</HI> professed, that he was the Lord of the whole world:
<HI>The Lord God of Heauen, hath giuen me all the Kingdomes of the Earth.</HI> Thus
blinde and bewitching a thing is <HI>Ambition,</HI> that it dazeleth the sight of com|mon
sense and reason. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezra. 1. 2.</NOTE> all this great ostentation is indeed nothing else,
but, either the rhetoricall amplification of hyperbolizing Orators; wherein
<PB N="273" REF="143">
there is truely <HI>audacia Tropi;</HI> or, the vaine imagination of those fore-na|med
Monarchs, doting vpon their owne greatnesse. For, the two first
<HI>Monarchies</HI> of the <HI>Caldeans</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> were both of them shut vp, within
the lists of <HI>Asia,</HI> and scarcely touched the skirts of either <HI>Europe,</HI> or <HI>Africa.</HI>
The <HI>Graecian Monarchie</HI> wrought Eastward into <HI>Asia</HI> too: which, though
it stretched further then either of the former; yet were there many great
Countries, euen in <HI>Asia</HI> it selfe, both Northward, Southward, and Eastward,
where it neuer so much as touched. The <HI>Romane</HI> indeed stretched furthest
of all the rest, as being possessed of large Kingdomes and Dominions, both
in <HI>Asia, Europe,</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI> But yet, for all that, they were so farre from ob|taining
the Empire of the whole world, that they could neuer get wholy any
of these three parts of it: but there were in all of them diuers <HI>Regions</HI> and
Countries, <HI>Vbi nec Pelopidarum facta, ne&abque; famam audiebant:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 15. Epist. ad Attic. Epist. 326. p. 394.</NOTE> <HI>Where they ne|uer
so much as heard,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 2. de Som. Scip. c. 10. p. 111.</NOTE> <HI>either the facts or the fame, of either Grecians, or Ro|names.</HI>
As <HI>Macrobius</HI> ingenuously acknowledgeth: <HI>Gangem transnare, aut
Caucasum transcendere, Romani nominis fama non valuit. The fame of the Ro|manes,</HI>
as great as it was, yet was neuer so great, as <HI>either to be able to swim ouer
the Riuer Ganges, nor yet climbe ouer the mountaine Caucasus.</HI> So that, euen their
<HI>Fame</HI> came farre short of those swelling amplifications, which before you
saw vsed, by their Orators, and Poets. But their Dominion came much
shorter: as is expresly affirmed by the fore-alledged Author, <HI>Totius Terrae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. ibid.</NOTE>
<HI>quae ad Coelum puncti locum obtinet, minima quaedam particula, &agrave; nostri generis
hominibus, possidetur. That though the whole Earth, compared with the Hea|uens,
be no bigger then a Center in the midst of a Circle; yet that scarce the least
parcell of this little Earth, did euer come into the hands of the Romanes.</HI> Thus,
euen these great and mighty <HI>Monarchies,</HI> which were the highest Columnes
of Maiestie vpon the Earth, yet haue, all of them, beene reduced within their
bounds and limits: yea and those very streight ones. And therefore none of
the minor and inferior Kingdomes could be left without limits. As <HI>Tertul|lian</HI>
plainely proueth, by a particular enumeration of the greatest, and most
famous of them. <HI>Si Salomon regnauit, in finibus tant&ugrave;m Iudeae; &agrave; Bersabe vs&abque;

tenuit. Si Germani adhuc vs&abque; limites transgredi non sinuntur. Britanniae,
intra Oceani ambitum, conclusae sunt. Maurorum gens, &amp; Getulorum barbaries
a Romanis obsidentur, ne Regionum suarum fines excedant. Quid de Romanis
dicam, qui de legionum suarum praesidio imperium sunm muniunt, nec trans
istas Gentes porrigere vires Regni sui possunt?</HI></P>
<P><HI>If Salomon raigned as a King, yet was it but onely in the Kingdome of Iu|dea:
the borders of his Kingdome extended no farther then from Dan vnto
Beersheba. If Darius raigned ouer the Babylonians and Parthians; yet had
be no dominion beyond the bounds of his owne Kingdome: hee could not com|mand
ouer euery other nation. If Pharaoh and his Successors raigned ouer the
<PB N="274" REF="144">
Aegyptians, yet all his dominion was onely ouer them. If Nabucodonosor and
his Princes haue raigned from India vnto Aethiopia, yet there his Kingdome en|ded.
So Alexander himselfe could neuer obtaine whole Asia, nor yet long
retaine those Regions which he there had conquered. The Germans are not suf|fered
to goe beyond their limits. The Britains are shut vp within the compasse
of the Sea. The Moores and Getulians are kept in by the Romanes, so that they
cannot come without their bounds. Nay, the Romanes themselues are faine to
guard their dominions with their Garrisons and Legions, and cannot extend
their Empire ouer all nations, at their pleasure.</HI> And that which he affirmeth
of those fore-named Nations, may likewise bee obseru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d in all others. There
is no Kingdome in the world, but it is shut-vp and included within some li|mits:
yea and those oftentimes but very meane and weake ones: sometimes,
a shallow Riuer; someties, a narrow Hill; sometimes, a field of sand. So
weake meanes of inhibiting so strong desires, and so feeble, of resisting so vn|bridled
ambitions, that it is vtterly impossible for so weake and simple
bounders, to be able to keepe in such men within their bounds, if God him|selfe
were not the <HI>Bounder</HI> of them. But hee, as hee hath by his power ap|pointed,
that a little weake sand should stoppe the rage of the swelling wa|ters;
so hath hee likewise appointed, that such weake termes and limits should
keepe in the proudest and most ambitious Princes, as it were raging Lions,
with their grates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob, 38. 11.</NOTE> and cages. As if God, that hath sayd vnto the Sea, <HI>Hitherto
shalt thou come, and no further; and here shalt thou stay all thy proud and swel|ling
waues:</HI> should likewise haue sayd vnto Kings, and their Kingdomes, (as
<HI>Seneca</HI> well expresseth it) <HI>Vltra Istrum, Dacus non exeat. Istmus Samothracas
includat.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seneca, l. 1. Nat Quaest. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a Prae|sat, p. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Parthis obstet Euphrates. Danubius Sarmatica ac Romana disterminet.

Let the Dacians be contained within the riuer Ister. The Samothracians within
their proper Istmus. The Parthians within Euphrates. Let Danubius distinguish
betweene the Romanes and Sarmatians: and Rhenus restraine the daring Ger|manes.
Let the mountaine Pyrenaeus diuide the French, and Spaniards: and the
wildernesse of Sand the Aethiopians, from Aegyptians.</HI> And in like manner
also be all other Kingdomes: they are bound within their bounders, as it
were in bands; aad shut-vp within their limits, as it were in prison. Now the
<HI>Bounder</HI> of all these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 1.</NOTE> is onely God himselfe: who (as I haue <HI>before</HI> shewed) is
the <HI>Bounder</HI> of all things.</P>
<P>And this also appeareth by the liquid and cleere testimonies, both of Holy
Scriptures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 32. 8.</NOTE> and of Heathen writings. The <HI>Prophet Moses</HI> affirmeth, that it is
<HI>The most High God, that diuided vnto the Nations their inheritance, and sepa|rated
the sonnes of Adam, and appointed the borders of the people.</HI> And
<HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI> affirmeth, <HI>That it is God, that appointed a ruler ouer euery people,
when he diuided the Nations of the whole Earth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 17. 15.</NOTE> So that, both the erecting
of Kings, and separation of Kingdomes, are the onely workes of God. And
therefore <HI>Trismegistus</HI> calleth God, <HI>Terrarum distributorem; The distri|buter
of Countries.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. Pi|mand. Dial, 13. p. 464.</NOTE> And <HI>Demosthenes</HI> citeth this sentence, out of the in|scription
of an Altar, that

<L><PB N="275" REF="144">
God Iupiter himselfe, I weene, the King of Gods, is he,</L>
<L>That causeth Countries, by their Lists, distinguished to be.</L></Q>
<HI>And this to preserue the people from contentions:</HI> as in the same place, hee af|firmeth.
For, where there be not such limits to distinguish them, there al
wayes doe the people contend about them. As <HI>Salust</HI> exemplisieth by a
notable instance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> betweene the <HI>Cathaginians,</HI> and the <HI>Cyreneans. Who hawing
long contended about their limits (and yet for a vaste feild of vnfruitfull bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rea
Sand) when they had euen wearied themselues with diuers mutuall slaugh|ters,
in the ende (for the ending of all contention) they fell vpon this Conclusion.
That they should both of them send forth at a certaine praefixed time, certaine
Messengers from their borders; and that the place, where they should meete,
should be the Boundes of both Nations. The Carthaginians sent for them two
Brothers called Phileni: by whose speed and diligence, they obtained great ad|vantage.
Which, when the Cyrenians chalenged, as being fraudulently gotten, by
their setting forth before the appointed time; they offered them this condition;
that, either the Phileni should be content to be buried quick, in the place where
they mett, and which they chalenged for other limits; or else they should permit
the setting of their limits vnto those Cyrenians, vnder the same condition
which was propounded vnto them. Which condition (though vnaequall) yet the
Phileni accepted: and so were both of them in the place buried quicke. Vnto
whom, for their valour the Carthaginians there erected, and consecrated an
Altar: as an aeternall monument, both of the limits of their Dominion, and of
the honour of these two noble Brethren, by whom they had obtayned the same.</HI>
Out of which memorable historie, we may draw these three obseruatious, to
our present purpose. First, that where there be no knowne limits betweene
Kingdome and Kingdome, there be alwayes contentions and quarells about
them. Secondly&punc; that the way to quench those quarells, is, there to set vp
some artificiall limits, where there be no naturall. And thirdly, that euen
those casuall and accidentall limits, yet are in those places fixed by the se|cret
decree and appointment of God: which, both this Altar of the <HI>Phileni</HI>
insinuated, and the forenamed Altar of <HI>Demosthenes</HI> expressed:
<Q><L>&mdash;Iupiter ipse.</L>
<L>Rex super&ucirc;m, medius limite signat agros.</L></Q></P>
<P>7 And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God giueth the times of conti|nuance vnto Kingdomes</NOTE> as God hath circumscribed the dominions of all King, within
their bounds and limits: so hath hee also prescribed vnto all Kingdomes
and Empires the times of their continuance. Both which points the
Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> hath expressed in one sentence. <HI>God hath made, of one blood, al
mankinde, to dwell vpon all the face of the Earth:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 26.</NOTE> <HI>and hath assigned the
times, which were ordayned, and the bounds of their habitation.</HI> He both ap|pointeth
the bounds of their habitations; which was our former point: and
assigneth the <HI>times of their contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ance,</HI> which is our present point. The
same God, <HI>which hath determined the dayes of al men, and kept the iust num|ber
of their months with him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 14. 5.</NOTE> <HI>appointing them their bounds which they cannot
passe;</HI> he hath also appointed set periods of time, as well vnto Kingdomes, as
vnto priuate persons: to some <HI>a time;</HI> to some, <HI>two times;</HI> to some,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel, 7. 22. 12. 7.</NOTE> <HI>halfe a
time;</HI> to some, all these together, at his owne will and pleasure. Which times
and periods being fulfilled (as the dayes of a man when they are expired)
<PB N="276" REF="145">
they are by and by dissolued. And this we may see verified as well in the
great and mighty Monarchies; as in the smaller and inferior kingdomes.

<L>The Medes destroyd th' Assyrian Stock; the Persian slew the Medes.</L>
<L>The Persian Monarch was subdued by that great Macedo:</L>
<L>The Macedon must shortly yeeld vnto the Romane foe.</L></Q>
And the same may be seene in diuerse other Kingdomes, as <HI>Bartus</HI> ex|emplifieth
by many notable instances. So that, as in the same place hee
obserueth:
<Q><L>As when the Wind the angry Ocean moues,</L>
<L>Waue hunteth waue and billow billow shoues:</L>
<L>So doe all Nations iustle each the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bartus in his Colonies. p 442.</NOTE></L>
<L>And so one People doth pursue another.</L>
<L>And scarce a second hath the first vnhoused,</L>
<L>Before a third him thence againe hath rowsed.</L></Q>
Thus the greatest Kingdomes for force, yet haue beene of small continuance,
being successiuely cut off by the sword of their enemies. But yet that, not
by chance, but by Gods speciall ordinance: who, when the number of their
dayes were expired (that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 15. 16.</NOTE> <HI>when they had fullfilled the measure of their
wickednesse</HI>) then sent vpon them, the sword of other Nations, for the
punishment of their sinnes. For the swords of men are but the Rods of
God, whereby hee scourgeth them that rebell against him: as hee himselfe
affirmeth, both of the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> and of the <HI>Babilonians,</HI> calling the one
of them, <HI>the rod of his wrath,</HI> and the other <HI>his Hammer and his weapon of
warre, wherewith hee will breake downe nations and destroy Kingdomes.</HI> So<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 10. 5.</NOTE> So
that though they whett the sword,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 51. 20.</NOTE> yet it is God that strikes the stroke.
It is he that breaketh in sunder those Kingdomes with his hammer. Which
yet he doth not before their appointed time be fulfilled. For (as <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI>
expresly affirmeth) <HI>Vnto all things there is an appointed time. A time to
plant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 3. 1. 2.</NOTE> <HI>and a time to pluck vp.</HI> And the appointer of those times is onely God
himselfe as by this one Argument it euidently appeareth; that hee is so per|emptorie
and definite in foretelling the certaine times of the continuing and
falling of diuers Kingdomes. Hee foretold of the great and mighty King|dome
of <HI>Babilon</HI> that it should continue but onely vnto the third generation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 27. 6. 7.</NOTE>
and that then it should vtterly be vndone. <HI>I haue giuen all these lands into

shall serue him and his Sonne and his Sonnes Sonne, vntill the very time

of him:</HI> what could be more definite? And that he neither deceiued nor
was deceiued in it, the euent which followed, openly declared. For in the time
of <HI>Belshazzer Nebuchadnezzers Sonnes Sonnes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 5. 28 30. 26.</NOTE> the <HI>Babilonian Monarchy</HI> was
dissolued, and that by the written decree of God, who there professeth that
<PB N="277" REF="145">
the <HI>number of that Kingdome was fulfilled.</HI> And as definite as hee was in

in appointing the set time of the Iewish Captiuitie vnder them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 25. 11, 12.</NOTE> <HI>This whole

that was fulfilled, as soone as the time, fore-told by <HI>Ieremy,</HI> was finished.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Chro. 36. 22. Ezra. 1. 1.</NOTE> And,
for the second part of the Prophecie, concerning the destruction of the
<HI>Babilonian Kingdome;</HI> it followeth by consequent vpon the former.</P>
<P>For <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who, in the first yeare of his raigne, gaue order for the returne
of the <HI>Iewes,</HI> was one of those Princes, who were the ouerthrowers of the <HI>Ba|bilonians.</HI>
As concerning which Prince, in giuing his name, almost an hun|dred
yeares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay. 44 28</NOTE> before hee was borne;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay. 45. 1.</NOTE> there is so great an euidence of Gods
fore-seeing prouidence, that a paralell to that prophecie, cannot bee giuen, in
all the secular Historie. And as God hath bene definite, in foretelling the
very time of the destruction of <HI>Babilon;</HI> so hath hee bene likewise, in fore|shewing
the destruction, both of the <HI>Ephraemites,</HI> and of the <HI>Aegyptians:</HI>
pointing downe precisely, vpon the very number of the yeares: <HI>Within

And for <HI>Egypt,</HI> he sayth: <HI>I will make the land of Egypt desolate, for forty yeares
&amp;c. But, at the end of forty yeares, I will gather the Egyptians from the people,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 29. 12. 13.</NOTE>
<HI>where they were scattered.</HI> Now, this so peremptorie assigning of a definite
time, as well of their captiuitie, as of their libertie, doth euidently shew, not
onely that those times are certainly appointed; but also that this appoint|ment
is onely made by God. Who (as our Sauiour <HI>Christ</HI> teacheth vs) <HI>hath

<ARGUMENT>
<P>God is, both the Physicall, and Ethicall last end of all things. 2. Hee giueth vs
all vertues, which are the way vnto perfect Blessednesse. 3. Hee implanteth
in vs all good affections, which are the praeuious dispositions vnto vertues.
4. He giueth vnto vs the true and perfect Blessednesse. 5. Nay, hee him|selfe
is, our true and perfect Blessednesse.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_LET vs now proceede forward, from the <HI>Politicks,</HI> vnto the
<HI>Ethicks;</HI> which affoord vs many Arguments, to proue <HI>There
is a God:</HI> and that by the confession, euen of the very Hea|then.
For, as the <HI>Physicks</HI> doe inferre, that there needes
must be a <HI>God;</HI> because there is noe moe but one <HI>Primum
Efficiens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. Phys. c. 3. To. 1. p. 433.</NOTE> but <HI>one first Efficient Cause,</HI> from which all things doe pro|ceede:
so the <HI>Ethicks</HI> doe inforce the same conclusion vnto vs; because there
is no moe, but one <HI>vltimus finis,</HI> but one <HI>last finall cause,</HI> vnto which all things
are referred. Which last End; as <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe teacheth, both in
his <HI>Physicks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. Ethic. c. 1. To. 2. p. 604.</NOTE> and in his <HI>Ethicks;</HI> must needes be <HI>Summum bonum, ipsum&abque; adeo
Optimum:</HI> that is, <HI>The chiefest and most soueraigne good of all things.</HI> For,
<Q><L>Quanto est posterior, tanto est praestantior omnis</L>
<L>Finis.&mdash;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paling. in l. conc. p. 103.</NOTE></L>
<L>Among all Ends, the Latter, is euermore the better.</L></Q>
<PB N="279" REF="146">
And consequently, the last must needs be the best. And so must needs be <HI>God.</HI>
Or else there should something be better then God. Which were vtterly ab|surd.
For, hee is the best of all. His title is, to be, <HI>Optimus.</HI> And therefore,
as God is that <HI>Primum Efficiens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 2. Cap. 3 Sect. 4.</NOTE> by whom all things were made: so is he al|so,
that <HI>Vltimus Finis,</HI> for whom all things were made. As the Scriptures
themselues haue expresly testified. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> telleth vs, that All
things were made, not only <HI>of</HI> God, but also <HI>for</HI> God too. <HI>Of him, and through
him, and</HI> for <HI>him are all things.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11. 36.</NOTE> So that hee is not onely their <HI>Primum Effici|ens,</HI>
that is, <HI>Their first Author</HI> from <HI>whom they came;</HI> but he is also, their <HI>Vlti|mus
Finis too,</HI> that is, <HI>Their last Ende,</HI> for <HI>whom they came.</HI> Both which points,
King <HI>Salomon</HI> confirmeth in his <HI>Prouerbs,</HI> in expresse and plaine words: <HI>The
Lord hath made all things for himselfe;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 16. 4.</NOTE> <HI>yea euen the wicked, for the day of euil.
The Lord hath made all thing:</HI> therefore hee is their <HI>Efficient. He hath made
them for himselfe:</HI> therefore he is their <HI>End.</HI>

<Q><L>God is the End, yea that last End,</L>
<L>Vnto which One, all things contend:</L>
<L>For which the world, and all therein.</L>
<L>Was made: For he made all for Him.</L></Q>
And, as God is <HI>Finis rerum, condendarum,</HI> that is, <HI>The last Ende, for which
all things were</HI> created: so is hee also, <HI>Finis rerum expetendarum: The last End
for which all things are</HI> desired. <HI>Whom haue I in Heauen but thee?</HI> (saith the
Prophet <HI>Dauid) and there is none vpon Earth that I desire in comparison of
thee.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal 73. 24.</NOTE> So that, God is not onely the naturall ende of all his Creatures; but
also the morall ende of all mens actions and affections. And this also may
be conclud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d, by the reason afore-framed. For, <HI>Aristotle,</HI> affirmeth in the
fore-alledged place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. Eth. c. 1. To. 2. p. 604.</NOTE> that, <HI>Si finis est quispiam rerum agendarum, quem, propter
seipsum, caetera autem propter hunc volumus; constat hunc talem Finem sum|mum
esse Bonum, ipsum&abque; optimum. If there be any such ende of all humane
actions, which we onely desire in respect of it selfe, and other things but with
reference vnto it; it is apparent, that such an ende must be that, which we call the
supreme, and chiefest good.</HI> Now, that must needs be God: vnlesse something
which is not God, should be better then God: vnlesse some other thing
should be <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> and God himselfe: be but <HI>Inferius Bonum.</HI> But
that God himselfe, and nothing else, is both the last ende of all humane acti|ons,
and that chiefest good, which is aymed at in all of them, it is generally
taught, in the Schooles of all the Heathen. Who deliuer vnto vs these <HI>foure
speciall Doctrines,</HI> as the principalls of their Morals. Yea, and that, with as
great and as vniforme a consent, as in any other of their doctrines can readi|ly
be found. First, that <HI>Vertue,</HI> which is the way vnto <HI>Felicitie,</HI> is giuen vs
of God. Secondly, that <HI>good Affections,</HI> which are praeparatiues vnto <HI>Vertue,</HI>
are also giuen by him. Thirdly, that <HI>Felicitie,</HI> which is the salarie and reward
of <HI>Vertue,</HI> is giuen vs of God. And Fourthly, That God himselfe, is our onely
true <HI>Felicitie.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="147">
2 For the first of which positions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vertue is the way vnto Feli|citie.</NOTE> and the first branch of it: it is a thing,
which is agreed vpon, among the very Heathen, that the ende of the <HI>Ethicks,</HI>
and <HI>Morall Philosophie,</HI> is to bring men, by vertue, vnto the true Felicitie.
<HI>Felicitie</HI> is the ende of all mens actions and desires: but <HI>Vertue</HI> is the way,
whereby men come vnto that ende. As <HI>Tullie</HI> exemplifieth in the person of
<HI>Hercules.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">. p. 113.</NOTE> <HI>Abijt ad Deos Hercules: sed nunqu&agrave;m abijsset, nisi, qu&ugrave;m inter Ho|mines

<HI>Rebus gestis, at&abque; virtutibus: By his nobles Acts, and by his vertues.</HI> And,
that <HI>Vertue</HI> is the direct and compendious way vnto <HI>Felicitie, Aristotle</HI>

<HI>quasi perfectio Naturae:</HI> And yet againe: <HI>Est virtus nihil aliud, qu&agrave;m in

brought vnto her perfection &amp; hight.</HI> And therfore he setteth downe this
for a Conclusion, that, <HI>Nature alone can leade vs vnto vertue, if we follow her
direction:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de. leg. p. 314. p. 326. in Lambini Edit.</NOTE> <HI>Naturam ducem nactus, non est quisquam hominum, qui ad virtutem
pervenire non possit.</HI> Which sentences, in some sense, may be admitted, with
good acceptance, if they be interpreted of <HI>our originall &amp; vncorrupted.</HI> Na|ture.
But, consider of our Nature, as it is now <HI>depraued in vs,</HI> and by the cor|rupt

nothing more contrarie vnto our nature, then vertue; nothing more

that, <HI>Natura etiam prau&egrave; omnia facit:</HI> that, <HI>Nature doth all things
out of order.</HI> And, in another place, hee, disputing, which of the
two extreame vices, is most contrarie vnto the middle <HI>vertue,</HI> hee sets
downe this for a generall rule; that, <HI>That vice is alwayes most opposite
vnto vertue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. Eth. c. 8. To. 2. p. 625.</NOTE> <HI>vnto which our owne nature doth leade vs most willingly. Ea

place, expresly concludeth) <HI>Nullam fieri virtutem morum, in nobis, natur&acirc;:
That no morall vertue is bred in vs, by nature.</HI></P>
<P>For the second Opinion, that it is framed in vs by Art, and by the in|struction
of our Teachers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. To. 2. Mor. p. 252.</NOTE> <HI>Plutarch</HI> not onely approueth it, but also hath
written a Booke to prooue it, and, <HI>Vertutem posse doceri,</HI> inscribed it.
Which (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> well distinguisheth) is true indeede <HI>in intellectuall ver|tues:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 3, Eth. c. 1. To. 2. p. 615.</NOTE>
as <HI>in Arts, and Sciences:</HI> they may be taught vs. But in <HI>Moralls,</HI> it is
false. As out of the very name of <HI>morall vertues,</HI> in the same place, he col|lecteth:
That name importing, not institution, but custome; and that
such vertues are gotten, not by learning, but by practising. And there|fore
<HI>Socrates</HI> professeth (yea and proueth too) <HI>qu&ograve;d virtus nusquam discatur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato, in Prota|gora, p. 231.</NOTE>
<HI>null&oacute;&abque; praeceptore percipiatur: That vertue, can neither be learned, nor taught.</HI>
So that, as <HI>Tullie</HI> is confuted by <HI>Aristotle; That vertue is not of Nature:</HI>
so is <HI>Plutarch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Max. Tyr. Serm. 22. p. 263.</NOTE> by <HI>Plato; That it is not of Art.</HI> Which <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> also
confirmeth. <HI>Non fit ab Arte, qu&ograve;d euadunt boni, sed poti&ugrave;s beneficio Iouis: It
is not by Art, that men are made good; but rather by the grace and blessing of
God.</HI> For, as Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> very truely obserueth, <HI>Vera virtus nihil requirit,
nisi Dei gratiam:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambros. l. 2. de Iacob. c. 4. To. 4. p. 298.</NOTE> <HI>True vertue requireth nothing else, but onely Gods grace.</HI>
So that, it is neither of <HI>Nature,</HI> nor of <HI>Art,</HI> as <HI>Plato</HI> in another place expresly
affirmeth, reiecting both those two fore-named causes, in one sentence:
<HI>Apparet virtutem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us Serm. 1. p. 27.</NOTE> <HI>nec disciplin&acirc;, nec natura; sed diuin&acirc; sorte suis posses|soribus
accidere. It neither comes by nature, nor by learning, but onely by Gods
giuing.</HI></P>
<P>And for the third opinion, That it is gotten of our selues, onely by in|dustrie
and practise; that apparently is <HI>Aristotles,</HI> in the fore-alledged place.
<HI>Ne&abque; natur&acirc;, ne&abque; praeter naturam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 3. Eth. c. 1. To. 2. p. 616.</NOTE> <HI>virtutes in nobis efficiuntur: sed idonei qui|dem

But Nature giueth vs a fitnesse and hability to receiue them. But it is onely
practise and custome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pindarus in Nemeis Od. 6. p. 405.</NOTE> <HI>that ripens and perfects them.</HI> But yet (as <HI>Pindarus</HI>
truely noteth) All our practise and custome, will but a little profit vs, <HI>if God
doe not giue his blessing vnto vs. Ad summitatem virtutis pervenerunt, qui
labores experti sunt. Cum Dei autem fauore &amp;c. There be many that haue at|tained
to the highest pitch of vertue, by their labour and indeauour. But yet by
the assistance of Gods grace and fauour.</HI> And therefore <HI>Pythagoras</HI> giueth
vs aduice, not to rely too confidently vpon our owne endeauours, but to
ioyne our prayers vnto them, for Gods helpe and assistance.

According to that of <HI>Salomon,</HI> that, <HI>God hath made all things, for him|selfe;
yea, euen the wicked, for the day of euill.</HI> And yet is not God the
cause of mens wickednesse. Because hee maketh them not euill, <HI>inserendo

<L>Quenching prophane and fearefull lusts, that leade my mind astray.</L></Q>
He prayeth to God, to withhold him; because hee could not withhold him|selfe.
And so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homer. l. 1. Ilid. p. 7.</NOTE> when <HI>Achilles</HI> intended to haue killed <HI>Agamemnon, Pallas</HI> with|held
him from it, as <HI>Homer</HI> also testifieth: by that fiction, implying this vn|fayned
truth, that it is God, which withholdeth vs from euill, as well as which
helpeth vs in good. Both which points together, wee may euidently see, in
the prayer of the <HI>Pharisee:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 18. 11. 12.</NOTE> <HI>O God, I thanke thee, that I am not as other men
are, extortioners, vniust, adulterers.</HI> Here be the vices, from which God
had withheld him, and for which hee thanketh him. Hee proceedeth on, vnto
those vertues, wherewith God had adorned him. <HI>I faste twice in the Weeke,
and I giue tithe of all that euer I possesse.</HI> So that, if a man be not infected
with all kinde of vice, he may thanke God for it. And, if hee be indued with
any kind of vertue, he may thanke God for that too. For it is onely <HI>by the
grace of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 10.</NOTE> <HI>that he is, as he is.</HI> In which action of the Pharisee, we may eui|dently
see, a direct confutation of <HI>Tullies</HI> obseruation, that, <HI>Nemo qu&ograve;d bo|nus
vir esset, gratias Dijs egit vnqu&agrave;m.</HI> And againe in the same place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. de. Nat. Deor. p. 238.</NOTE> that
<HI>Virtutem, nemo vnqu&agrave;m acceptam Deo retulit: That no man had euer thanked
God, that he had made him a good man.</HI> For we see the plaine contrarie, in the
<PB N="284" REF="149">
prayer of the <HI>Pharisee:</HI> He expresly thanked God, that hee had made him so
good. So that here is a confutation of his first position. His second is this,
<HI>That no man euer acknowledged his vertue to haue descended vnto him from
God.</HI> Which we see againe confuted, by all those seuerall testimonies, that
before I haue recited. For they all haue professed, that <HI>Vertue is Gods gift.</HI>
As for the reason, which in that place hee bringeth, to fortifie his position;
<HI>That men are praysed for their vertues; which they could not iustly be, if it were
the gift of God, and not gotten by themselues:</HI> That is a very false and insuffici|ent
reason. For, men are praised, both for their <HI>Beautie,</HI> and for their <HI>strength
of bodie.</HI> And yet are both these the good gifts of God, and not purchased
or gotten by our selues. And therefore, as error is alwayes vnconstant, and ne|uer
true vnto it selfe; so hee, in another place, both renounceth his owne posi|tion,
and confuteth his owne reason. His position hee renounceth by a con|trarie
position, directly affirming, that, <HI>Si inest, in hominum genere, Mens,
Fides,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. Deor. p. 212.</NOTE> <HI>Virtus, Concordia; Vnde haec in terram, nisi a superis, defluere potuerunt?
If there be among men; either Wisdome, or Faith, or Vertue, or Peace; Whence
could any of these come to men vpon earth, but only from the God of heauen?</HI>
Naming <HI>Vertue,</HI> among the rest. And his Reason he confuteth by the instance
of <HI>Metellus, Maximus, Marcellus, Africanus, Cato, Scipio, Laelius,</HI> who were
the most vertuous, and the most prayse-worthy persons of the Romane Com|monwealth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. de Nat. Deor. p. 225.</NOTE>
And yet he affirmeth of them all, that <HI>Horum neminem, nisi iu|nante
Deo, talem fuisse, credendum est. That none of all these, could euer haue
beene such a man, as he was, if he had not beene helped and assisted by God.</HI> So
that hee ascribeth their <HI>Vertues,</HI> and consequently their prayses, vnto God.
Thereby plainly ouer-throwing, the ground of his position: and shewing,
that vertue may be praysed, although it be of God. Thus you see the great
agreement, which the Heathens Philosophers haue with the Scriptures, in
ascribing vnto God, to be the Author of all Vertues.</P>
<P>3 Neither is God onely the Author and giuer of growne and perfect
Vertue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God is the Gi|uer of all good motions and affections.</NOTE> when it is formed into an habit; but also of all those good motions,
and affections, which are, as it were, the praeparatiues vnto it: or rather indeed
the inchoations of it. Those good inclinations, and vertuous propensions,
which (being adult and growne vp) doe proue the true substance and bodies
of our vertues, are indeed not in vs any naturall dispositions; (as <HI>Tullie</HI> would
haue them:)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunt ingenijs nostris semina <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> virtutum quae si adolescere liceret, ipsa nos ad beatam vi|tam Natura per|duceret.</NOTE> but supernaturall inspirations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. Tusc.</NOTE> and Gods owne celestiall semina|tions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut 30. 6.</NOTE>
as the Prophet <HI>Moses</HI> expresly affirmeth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 13.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord thy God wil circum|cise
thy heart, that thou mayst loue him, with all thy heart, &amp; liue.</HI> So that the first
motions of our loue towards God, are onely the motions of his loue towards
vs. Hee moueth vs to loue him, that we may liue with him. Without whose
grace thus mouing vs, we could haue no motion in vs, at the least not vnto
good. For, the Apostle plainely teacheth vs, that, <HI>it is God, that giueth vs both
the will, and the worke.</HI> Hee both giueth vs the vertues, and the feede of them
too, which are good affections. For, as the same Apostle in another place tel|leth
vs: <HI>We are not able of our selues, so much as to thinke any thing, but all our
sufficiencie is of God:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 3. 5.</NOTE> So that, with the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> we may truely pro|fesse:
<HI>O Lord, thou it is, that hast wrought all our works for vs.</HI> And this
euen the Heathen themselues doe acknowledge:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 26. 12.</NOTE> running through all the
<PB N="285" REF="149">
steppes of the Apostles former doctrine. One of them telleth vs, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucan. l. 9. p. 127. b.</NOTE>
<Q><L>Nil agimus, nisi sponte Dei.</L>
<L>By vs there can be nothing done,</L>
<L>But by the will of God alone.</L></Q>
Another of them, that wee speake nothing, but by the will of God. <HI>Natu|ra
humana, nec rationem, nec orationem de Dijs suscipere potest, sine Dijs;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">mblic. c. 26. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>
<HI>nedum divina opera perficere, sine illis. The nature of man, can neither con|ceiue,
nor vtter any thing of the nature of God, without the helpe of God:
much lesse can it doe any worke of God, without him.</HI> Another of them telleth
vs, that wee cannot thinke any thing, without him: because all our cogitati|ons
and thoughts doe come from him.
<Q><L>Talis en&igrave;m mens est terrestrium hominum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homer, lib. 18. Odys. p. 528.</NOTE></L>
<L>Qualem quotidi&egrave; ducit pater, viror&uacute;m&abque;, Deor&uacute;m&abque;.</L></Q>
saith <HI>Homer.</HI>
<Q><L>Such thoughts Men haue, on earth that liue;</L>
<L>As Men may craue, but God doth giue.</L></Q>
And so likewise <HI>Archilocus,</HI> vnto the same purpose:

<L>Mans minde doth dayly such it selfe explay,</L>
<L>As Gods great Will doth frame it euery day.</L></Q>
So that all the good motions and affections of the minde, the very
Heathens doe professe, to proceede from God. And therefore <HI>Orpheus,</HI>
in his hymme vnto <HI>Nemesis,</HI> prayeth to that Goddesse, to giue a
vertuous and good minde vnto men, and to remooue all euill cogita|tions
from them.

<L>Giue, Nemesis, &ocirc; giue a vertuous minde to men,</L>

Acknowledging all good motions, to bee Gods inspirations. And so
likewise, on the contrarie, they againe professe, that all those wicked and
depraued affections, whereby the minde of a man is corrupted, and so
led headlong into all kinde of vice, are indeede nothing else, but the sug|gestions,
and temptations of Diuells, and wicked spirits. <HI>Daemon vltor</HI>

giuing vnto vs all kindes of vertues, and giuing vnto vertues all their growth

wherewith the Diuell endeauoureth to extinguish vertue in vs. For, that
also they adde: <HI>Adsum ego Mens, ijs</HI> (saith <HI>Pimander in Trismegistus,</HI> who

after. <HI>Ipsa Mens, ianitoris munere fungens, incidentes in insidias corporis,

The Spirit (performing the part of a Porter) when as any of them fall
into the snares of the flesh, will not permit and suffer them to finish their de|signe,
but shutteth vp the passages of all flattering inticements, and extingui|sheth
the incentiues of all filthy lusts: By faith</HI> thus <HI>quenching the fiery darts
of the Diuell,</HI> as the Apostle speaketh. For, this Spirit is water: <HI>in quo, om|nia
ignita illius peruer si tela extinguuntur:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph: 6. 16. Nazian. Orat. 40 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> sanctum Baptisma. p, 621.</NOTE> as <HI>Nazianzene</HI> obserueth. <HI>He is
a Water, that extinguisheth all the darts of the Diuell, because they bee of fire.</HI>
And, as this good Spirit (like a Porter) repelleth euill spirits, that they can|not
enter: so hee also (like a Souldier) expelleth them againe, if they chance
to enter. Hee taketh from <HI>those strong men, the armour, wherein they trusted,
and casteth them out of the house,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke, 11. 21, 22.</NOTE> <HI>which they possessed.</HI> And this also, the Hea|then
<PB N="278" REF="150">
then haue expresly confessed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iamblic. c. 30. p. 97.</NOTE> <HI>Dij vera bona dant bonis, quibuscum versan|tur</HI>

giue to good men those things that are truly good, when they come vnto them; ex|pelling
by their presence, all passions, and vices; driuing from them, by their
light, the Angels of darkenesse. For the light of the Gods, when it entreth mens
mindes, driueth away the Diuels, as the light of the sunne driueth away darkenes.</HI>
So that though the Diuell be neuer so malicious, in seeking to doe men
hurt; yet is God no lesse gracious, in seeking to doe them good: the Diuell,
by euill temptations, seeking to corrupt them, and so bring them to miserie:
God, by good inspirations, seeking to correct them, and so bring them to fe|licitie,
Which is our next point.</P>
<P>4 For, as the Heathen doe confesse, that <HI>God is the Giuer of all Vertue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">God is the Gi|uer of felicitie vnto men.</NOTE> <HI>and

of all good things.</HI> God giueth <HI>all</HI> good things: and he giueth them not spa|ringly:
not <HI>digitulis duobus sumens primoribus;</HI> as the Comick speaketh; not <HI>ta|king

He giueth to the full, with an open hand. <HI>He openeth his hand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 104. 28.</NOTE> <HI>and filleth

but <HI>Dispensator. He is not a rash powrer-out of his benefits; but a wise
Disposer of them.</HI> Because, as in another place he addeth, <HI>Nec ratio, sine bo|nitate,

<P>Now, if God be the giuer of all good things: then must hee needs be the
giuer of Felicitie too, which is the principall good thing: If of the smal|ler
and lower goods, then much more of Felicitie, which is the greatest and
highest.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> For <HI>Plato</HI> maketh that collection. <HI>Ipsum bonorum omnium authorem
cur non maximi etiam boni causam arbitrabimur? He that is the Author of all
good, why should hee not be the Author of the greatest good?</HI> Yea, and <HI>Aristo|tle</HI>
himselfe inferreth the same conclusion: <HI>Si aliquod aliud Deorum est mu|nus

men any other gift or bounty, then st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ndeth it with reason, that hee should also
giue felicitie: yea, and that so much the more, by how much that gift is better.</HI>
Whence he concludeth, that Felicitie is giuen to men by God: because it is
the best of all other gifts. As <HI>Plato,</HI> from the same ground, concludeth the
same, for wisedome, in the place before alledged. Which, in another place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. p. 256.</NOTE>
he affirmeth directly, to be the true Felicitie. <HI>Sapientia, ipsa felicitas est: Quod
puer quivis intelligat. Wisedome is the true felicitie: as euery Child may vn|derstand
very easily.</HI> And therefore, <HI>Homer</HI> doubteth not to affirme expresly
that it is onely God himselfe, that is the giuer of Felicitie.
<Q><L>Iupiter ipse distribuit felicitatem Olympius hominibus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homer. l. 6. Odys. p. 168.</NOTE></L>

that the <HI>Romans</HI> consecrated it, for one of their Gods: thereby plainely insi|nuating,
that as <HI>Vertue,</HI> so <HI>Felicity,</HI> is the onely gift of God. Both which points
are affirmed, by <HI>Maximus Tyrius,</HI> in expresse and plaine words: <HI>Ex Iovis

Thus the Heathens confesse, that not onely <HI>Vertue,</HI> which is the way vnto
felicitie; but also that <HI>Felicitie,</HI> which is the reward of <HI>Vertue,</HI> are both of
them, the gifts of Almighty God. And therefore they must needs confesse,
<HI>There is a God,</HI></P>

Felicitie, for a God. For, thereby they insinuated, not only that <HI>Feli|city</HI>
is <HI>of</HI> God: (the point before noted:) but also <HI>that God is the onely true
Felicity:</HI> the point now in hand. Which they demonstrate vnto vs, by a <HI>Gra|dation,</HI>
of three degrees. First, that <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Godliness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> doe so strictly
vnite a man vnto God, that, in some degree, that it maketh him partaker of the
diuine and heauenly nature. Secondly, that this neere coniunction of man
vnto God, doth bring him vnto heauen, which is the place of Gods dwelling.
And thirdly, that there it maketh him partaker of Gods most blessed and
beatificall vision; which is the highest summitie of all true felicity. And
all these three points are so taught by the Heathens, as though they had bene
catechized in the Schoole of <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>For the first of which three points, it is the constant doctrine of the wi|sest
of the Heathen, that mans felicitie, consisteth especially, in conforming
himselfe vnto the nature of God, and in making himselfe to be like vnto him.

This vertue makes a man, not <HI>similem Deo,</HI> but <HI>parem Deo,</HI> saith <HI>Seneca: not

as a common opinion, that, <HI>Ex hominibus Dij fiunt, ob virtutis excellentiam:
That by the excellencie of vertue, euen men doe attaine to a kinde of Diuinity.</HI>
A very excessiue and hyperbolicall speech: but yet diuers such there be vsed
not onely by Heathens, but also by <HI>Christians,</HI> to expresse that great affi|nitie,

strictly vnto God. And this is the first degree of our felicitie with God, which
is affoorded vnto vs, in this present life.</P>
<P>There be two degrees more: which come not vnto men, before the life to
come. The first, that <HI>vertue</HI> brings vs vp to Heauen, which is the place of
Gods owne dwelling, and there maketh vs to liue aeternally with him. A thing
plainely confessed, euen by the very Heathen. <HI>Pythagoras</HI> affirmeth, in his ver|ses,
that:

For we shall then enioy God: <HI>who is our very life:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 30. 20. Cic. l. de. Amicit. p. 396.</NOTE> as the Prophet <HI>Moses</HI> te|stifieth:

<HI>Tullie,</HI> in another place, speaking of the state of God, and vertuous men af|ter

So that, God calleth those men to liue with him in heauen, with whom
he himselfe hath liued vpon earth.</P>
<P>Now the way, whereby they ascend vp into Heauen, there to liue with
God, is, by instructing themselues in the knowledge of God: As some, euen
of the Heathens themselues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg in Pi|mand. Dial. 10. p. 426.</NOTE> haue taught vs. <HI>Trismegistus</HI> saith expresly,

must therefore ioyne <HI>theorical</HI> and <HI>practicall</HI> vertues together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. 2. 7.</NOTE> and by them,
as by two legges, ascend into Heauen. Which is the true <HI>Paradice,</HI> where

<L>The Paradice of God, Heauen, onely is:</L>
<L>The onely happy place of perfect blis.</L></Q>
And vnto this heauenly <HI>Paradice,</HI> it is vertue that bringeth vs. And that by
the confession, euen of the very Heathen. For,
<Q>&mdash;Locum Virtus habet inter Astra,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. in Herc. Oetaeo. Act. 4. Sce. 4. p. 112.</NOTE></Q>
saith the Tragick <HI>Seneca:</HI>
<Q>Virtue enioyes her place <HI>among</HI> the Starres.</Q>
And she giueth to the vertuous, their place <HI>aboue</HI> the starres, seating them

<L>When the last howre is out, of the last wasted day,</L>

<P>And this is the second degree of our Felicitie with God; that, by vertue, men
<PB N="293" REF="153">
are brought to liue eternally, in Heauen, which is the place of Gods owne
dwelling.</P>
<P>The third of them, is this; That, by vertue, we are brought to enioy Gods
blessed presence: whereby wee enioy that infinite happinesse, that cannot

<HI>which the eye hath not scene, neither the eare heard, neither came into mans

<HI>and, at his right hand, there are pleasures for euermore.</HI> And therefore, our

the comfort and blessednesse of the soules of the righteous, by enioy|ing

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Mathematicks shew, that there is a God. 2. And more particularly,
Geometry. 3. Which, by a Geometricall pricke, doth leade men vnto
some knowledge of God. 4. Of whom (in diuers powers) it hath a kind
of resemblance.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_WE haue now passed ouer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mathematicus circa Abstracta speculatur, tol|lendo omnia sensibil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a.</NOTE> both the <HI>Metaphysicks, Physicks, Phi|sicke,
Politicks,</HI> and <HI>Ethicks:</HI> in all which seuerall learnings wee
haue learned, <HI>There is a God;</HI> both by Reasons, and Authorities.
We are now come to the <HI>Mathematicks:</HI> Which, as they are
something more abstracted from sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 11. Me|taphyl. c. 3. To. 2. p, 1485.</NOTE> and from sensible Ob|iects,
then any of all those fore-named <HI>Sciences;</HI> so can they no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> yeeld vs such
sensible Arguments, to proue this great Conclusion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 11. Meta. c. 4. p, 1486. &amp; Seminar. Philos. p 797.</NOTE> as the former can. For
the proper subiect of the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> (especially of those two Arts, of
<HI>Geometrie,</HI> and <HI>Arithmeticke;</HI> which I handle in this Chapter, and in the
<PB N="295" REF="154">
next after) is onely to consider, of <HI>Quantum, secund&ugrave;m se: Of Quantities by
themselues,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ficin. Argument in. l. 7. Platonis de repub. p. 616.</NOTE> abstracted from their subiects. And therefore we must not looke
from them, for either discourses, or demonstrations, or positions, directly &amp;
categorically to this purpose. But yet wee may draw, <HI>per obliquum ductum,</HI>
similitudes, and resemblances from both those two <HI>Sciences:</HI> whereby we may
ascend in our contemplation, euen vnto diuine and celestiall know|ledges:
as by the shape of the shadow, we may gather assuredly, the shape of
the body, For, as <HI>Ficinus</HI> hath truly obserued, to this purpose; <HI>Mathematica
ita se habent ad diuina, vt vmbrae ad corpora:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ficin. Argument. in Platonis The|aete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 134.</NOTE> <HI>Mathematicals are proportio|oned
vnto diuinitie, as the shadow to the Body.</HI> And therefore saith <HI>Alcinous</HI>
that, <HI>Mathematicorum consideratio, est praeludium ad diuinorum contempla|tionem.
The consideration of the Mathematicks, is as it were, a praeludium;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcin. c. 2. Semi|nar. philos. To. 2. p. 580.</NOTE> <HI>vn|to
the contemplation of diuine and heauenly things.</HI> For, the very end of the
Mathematicks (as <HI>Plato</HI> teacheth) is nothing else, but this; <HI>Vt ad diuinam
naturam considerandam, nos conferamus: quaten&ugrave;s hanc hominibus inspicien|dam
Deus largitus est.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Epi|nome. p. 918.</NOTE> <HI>Quam nunquam sine his artibus assequemur. The end
of the Mathematicks, is, to leade vs men intentiuely to consider of the nature
of God, and to contemplate of it, so farre, as it is lawfull to inquire into it.
Which we can neuer compasse, without the knowledg of Mathematicall Arts.</HI>
And therefore <HI>Aristotle</HI> calleth the <HI>Mathematicks, Divinam mathe sin,</HI> that
is, <HI>a diuine learning:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. Mete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r c. 3. To. 1. p. 691.</NOTE> because they leade men vnto the knowledg of diuine

<P>Now, vnder the name of <HI>Mathematicks</HI> are comprehended foure Arts: <HI>Geome|trie,
Arithmetick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. 1. 2. Metap. c. 3. To. 2 p. 1388</NOTE> <HI>Astronomie,</HI> and <HI>Musick,</HI> Which Mathematicall Arts and
sciences (as <HI>some</HI> of the learned haue wittily obserued) were practised by
God, in his creation of the world. He vsed <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> in knitting all the in|numerable
parts of the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Coel. Rhodi+gin. l. c. 2. p. 6.</NOTE> in one body together: <HI>Geometry,</HI> in giuing vn|to
euery one, his proper forme and figure: And <HI>Musick,</HI> in ioyning them,
in so concent-full an harmonie, each of them with another. Vnto which
Mathematicall conceit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisd. 11. 17. Coel. Rhodigin. l. 1. Ant, lect. c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 6.</NOTE> doth <HI>Coelius Rhodiginus</HI> think that place in the Booke

of <HI>Plato: Deum semper Geometriam exercere,</HI> saith, in expresse words: <HI>That
God made all things, Ratione, &amp; Mensura, &amp; Numero: in Wisedome, Measure
and Number.</HI></P>
<P>Out of certaine grounds in all which Arts, we may collect, <HI>That there is
a God</HI> though not <HI>Mathematica certitudine</HI> (which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mathematica certitudo non est in omnibus quae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">enda.</NOTE> as euen <HI>Aristotle</HI> him|selfe

who hauing found out the truth of a certaine <HI>Geometricall Conclusion</HI>
for which he had a long time before beene studying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 3. de Nat. Deor. p. 239.</NOTE> he offered vp <HI>a Sacri|fice</HI>
vnto the <HI>Muses:</HI> thereby insinuating, that his illumination came from
aboue: and so, by his <HI>Geometry,</HI> was ledde vnto the worship of the Deitie;
though vnder the title of <HI>the Muses.</HI> And therefore, saith <HI>Aristotle,</HI> that
<HI>Qui dicunt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 13. Meta c. 3&punc;. 2. p. 1513.</NOTE> <HI>Mathematicas scientias, nihil de bono &amp; pulchro dicere,
falsum dicunt. Dicunt enim, &amp; maxim&egrave; ostendunt. Nam, etsi non
nominant; c&ugrave;m tamen opera &amp; rationes ostendunt, nonn&egrave; dicunt de ijs? Those
men that affirme, that Mathematicall sciences doe no way intreat of either
Goodnesse, or Beauty, they affirme it very falsely For the Mathematicks doe dis|course
of them both. And, though they doe not expresly name them; yet, when they
intreate both of their works, and of their reasons, doe they not then intreate of
the things themselues?</HI> So that, though the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> doe not intreat
directly of God, who is that <HI>Bonum,</HI> and <HI>Pulchrum;</HI> yet, in that they doe
speake &amp; intreate of his works, they doe obliquely speake of him. And though
they conclude not so directly &amp; pere~ptorily, in this subiect of diuinity, as they
do in their owne proper subiect of Quantitie; wherein, as the <HI>Orator</HI> obserueth
they doe not <HI>persuadere, sed cogere;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 4. Acad. p. 30.</NOTE> yet, euen here, they doe affoord vs such
apt and fit resemblances, as, though they doe not <HI>cogere,</HI> yet may they well
<HI>persuadere: Such as well may induce vs, though they doe not inforce vs.</HI></P>
<P>3 And first for <HI>Geometry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Punctum in Geometrie leadeth men to God.</NOTE> there is one maine position in it: which though
it be proper and naturall vnto that Art; yet leadeth it vs, by consequence,
vnto that aeternall and supernaturall power, which is called <HI>God.</HI> And that
breefly is this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. Meta|phys. c. 7. To. 2. p. 1383.</NOTE> that, <HI>Punctum est principium omnis lineae.</HI> So that, all magni|tudes
and continuities are deduced from one originall prick.</P>
<P>And therefore <HI>Proclus</HI> calleth <HI>Punctum, magnitudinis parentem, &amp; autho|rem:</HI>
hee calleth <HI>a Pricke the parent of all magnitude.</HI> Which position, as
it hath his Mathematicall truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proclus in Eu|clid. l. 2. c. 11. Serm. Philos. To. 2. p. 765.</NOTE> in <HI>Geometry;</HI> so hath it his Physicall truth, in
<HI>naturall Philosophy.</HI> From whence it must needes follow, that all those so
largely extended lines, in the greatest bodies of the world, doe lineally des|cend
from one onely prick; which, in it selfe, is indiuisible. Now, what can
bee this one indiuisible pricke or point, which is the Author of all those
<PB N="297" REF="155">
huge magnitudes, which are euidently seene in those vast, and extended bo|dies
of the world, the heauens, and the elements, but onely God himselfe?
Can all those huge dimensions of those immense bodies, such heights, such
bredths, such depths, and such thicknesses, bee possibly deduced from any o|ther
pricke, then onely from God? who, though hee be both higher then hea|uen,
deeper then hell, broader then the sea, and thicker then the earth; yet is
hee, like a pricke in euery line of all of them; and, as vtterly vncapable of
any diuision, as is the very pricke of the <HI>Mathematician,</HI> which cannot be di|uided,
by the ege of very thought. Vnto which <HI>Mathematicall</HI> conceit, of
deducing all magnitudes, and all their dimensions, from God, as from their
true Originall point; the Apostle Saint <HI>Paul</HI> doth seeme to allude, when
hee exciteth vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 3. 18.</NOTE> <HI>to comprehend, what is the bredth, and length, and depth, and
height, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>4 And indeed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Punctum</HI> in Geometry re|sembleth in some sort the nature of God.</NOTE> if wee consider of the nature and power of a point or a
pricke in a line, and in all other continuities whatsoeuer, whether solides or
plaines; wee may easily perceiue, that there is in a pricke, a very great simili|tude
and resemblance of God. For first, as a point or pricke is the very first
fountaine of euery line, which is indeede nothing else, but only <HI>fluxus Puncto|tum:</HI>
so this whole <HI>vniuersality</HI> of things, which wee call <HI>the World,</HI> is indeed
nothings else, but a production, and elongation, and dilatation of the natu|rall
goodnesse of <HI>Almighty God.</HI> The goodnesse of God is the onely true
point, from which all created things doe proceede.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dionys. l. de coe|lesti Hierarch. c. 4. p. 29.</NOTE> For, as <HI>Dionysius Areo|pagita</HI>
very truely teacheth: <HI>Deus, bonitate ductus, omnes naturas in lucem pro|tulit.
God, being onely led by his owne naturall goodnesse, was thereby induced
to create and make all things.</HI> This is the true Center of all good things,
which are but as the <HI>radij,</HI> that bee drawne from it. And this is that, which
the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> aymed at,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. Meta|phys. c. 5. To. 2. p, 1375.</NOTE> in holding this position, that, <HI>Mathematicorum
principia, sunt omnium rerum principia. That the Principles of the Mathe|maticks,
are the beginnings of all things.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, as in euery line, and in euery part of it, wheresoeuer you cut it,
you shall surely finde a pricke; which was a <HI>communis Terminus</HI> vnto <HI>both</HI>
the diuided parts, being the beginning of the one, and the end of the other,
and which knitted, and vnited them both together: so, in euery part of the
world, which soeuer you contemplate, you shall find the mighty power of
the Spirit of God; which, like a common bond, knitteth all the seuerall
parts of euery thing together, and vniteth them all, in one common
nature. And this is manifestly acknowledged, euen by the Heathen
<HI>Poet:</HI>
<Q><L>Principio, Coelum, ac Terras, campos&abque;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virgil. l. 6. Aeneid. p, 267.</NOTE> liquentes,</L>
<L>Lucentem&abque; globum Lunae, Titania&abque; astra,</L>
<L>Spiritus intus alit: totam&abque; infusa per artus</L>
<L>Mens agitat molem, &amp; magnose corpore miscet.</L>
<L>From first beginning, there hath bene a certaine inward Spirit,</L>
<L>Supporting Heauen, and Earth; and Seas, Moone, Stars, and all things by it.</L>
<L>Which Spirit, like the <HI>Punctum</HI> is in Mathematicke body,</L>
<L>And so transfus'd in all the World, through all the parts that may be:</L>
<L>That, as the Soule (for such it is) by mouing can be proued,</L>
<L><PB N="298" REF="156">
So all the Worlds vast body is, by this Soule, euer moued.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 11. Me|taphys. c. 2. To. 2. p, 1484.</NOTE> as a pricke is the end of euery line, <HI>Linearum terminus,</HI> as <HI>Aristotle</HI>
speaketh, <HI>the extreame point, wherewith it is shut vp and determined:</HI> so is
God the end of all his <HI>Creatures.</HI> Hee is both, that <HI>Terminus &agrave; quo,</HI> from
which all things doe proceede; and that <HI>Terminus ad quem,</HI> vnto which they
all are referred; and that <HI>medium per quod,</HI> by which they are all of them vni|ted.
And all this is confessed, euen by the very Heathen: who do all affirme of
God, with one generall consent, that it is he onely, which doth, <HI>Et principi|um,
&amp; media,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. de Mun|do. To. 2. p, 1572.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; finem rerum omnium tenere. That God holdeth in his hands,
both the Beginning, and Middle, and End of all things.</HI> Yea, and this also,
the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> directly affirmeth, though in somewhat other termes, when
hee telleth vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11. 36.</NOTE> that, <HI>Of him, and through him, and to him, are all things, Of him</HI>
as <HI>of</HI> their <HI>Beginning: Through him;</HI> as <HI>by</HI> their <HI>Middle, tye, and Bond;</HI> and, <HI>To
him;</HI> as to their <HI>End.</HI> For so, <HI>Origen</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orig. l. 6. Cont. Celsum p, 766.</NOTE> expresly interpreteth those threetermes.
<HI>Ostendit, Principium omnium, ex ipso; Conseruationem, Per ipsum; Et Finem,
In ipsum.</HI> So that, God is that <HI>Punctum,</HI> in euery part of the world, <HI>from
whom,</HI> euery Creature in the world doth proceede; <HI>by whom,</HI> they are
preserued; and <HI>vnto whom,</HI> they bee destinated. And this is that resem|blance,
which <HI>Geometry</HI> affoordeth, to adumbrate the nature of God

teacheth vs, that <HI>Vnitas, est principium omnis numeri. As all

vnity.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. Metap. c. 7. To. 2 p, 1383.</NOTE> For <HI>Punctum,</HI> and <HI>Vnitas,</HI> differ no more but thus; that <HI>Punctum, est

the <HI>Pythagorean,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist&punc; l. 13. Meta. c. 8. To. 2. p, 1522.</NOTE> called <HI>Vnitatem, numeri patrem.</HI> Hee calleth <HI>an vnity, the
father of all numbers.</HI> Because (as <HI>Boetius</HI> very truely teacheth) <HI>Omnis plu|ralitas
est ex vnitatibus: All numbers are nothing else, but a coniunction of
vnities.</HI> Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. ibid. Plut. lib. de Ani|nac procreat, To. 3. Mor&punc; p, 93.</NOTE> if vnity be the parent of all multiplicitie, it must needs from
thence follow, that all this multiplicity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oet. lib. de Vni|tate. p, 1276.</NOTE> and variety of so infinite many things,
as wee see in the world, doe draw their originall, from onely vnity. For, one
vnity is the beginning of all plurality, as well in <HI>numero numerato, in that

<HI>Prima Vnitas, quae est vnitas sibijp si, creauit aliam vnitatem, quae est infra eam.
The first Vnity, which is one in it selfe (that is, God the Creator) hath created
another vnity, which is beneath it selfe, which is, vnity in the Creature.</HI> Where|by,
both euery thing is at one within it selfe and euery part of the world hath
vnity with another: they agreeing all most louingly, as fellow members to|gether.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dionys. Areopag. lib. de Diuin. nom&punc; c. 1. p. 192.</NOTE>

An Vnity, which is the efficient of all vnities.</HI> Yea, and in the same place, hee
alledgeth two substantiall reasons, why God may truely bee called <HI>One.</HI> The
first is, <HI>Propter simplicitatem vacuitatis partium</HI> (which <HI>Boetius</HI> before calleth,
<HI>Vnitatem sibijpsi:) Because God is so pure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p, 195&punc;</NOTE> <HI>and so simple an essence, that he is not
compounded, so much as of any parts:</HI> but is euery way one, without any mix|ture

it is to make things one) all those diuersities and differences, whereby wee are
diuided, be, after a speciall manner, conioyned, repraesenting in that vnity, an
image of the</HI> Deity, which is, <HI>Eorum, quae coniunguntur, coniunctio, &amp; vnitas:
The coniunction, and vnity of all those things that are ioyned and vnited toge|ther.</HI>
Which deity, is that vnity, not onely whereby all things are made one,
but also whereby all things were made. There is no one thing in the world,
but it is both made, and made one, by the vnity of the Deity. And therefore
<HI>Pythagoras</HI> maintained this opinion: <HI>Sine vnitate, nihil esse factum: That it is
Vnity, and nothing else, that is the maker of all things.</HI> Yea, and the preseruer
of them too: as <HI>Boetius</HI> affirmeth. For, <HI>Tamdi&ucirc; est vnumquod&abque;, id quod est</HI>

<P>So that, though by the error of his religion, he were led to affirme, that

<P>The reason of which their curiositie of speaking, was; because though all
of them found a true Vnitie in God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How God is not one.</NOTE> yet found they it to be such, as could not
be expressed by any word. But the neerest they could come vnto it, was the
name of <HI>Abstract Vnitie.</HI> For though God be one (as is confessed by them
all) yet is he not so one, as any other thing is one: but so, as nothing else is
one: as <HI>S. Bernard</HI> in his fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t Booke <HI>de Consideratione,</HI> hath expressed very
excellently. Where hee giueth instance, of eight seuerall wayes, whereby

is an Vnitie, which is made by collection; as when many Stones doe make but one

doe make but one body. There is an Vnitie which is made by coniunction; as
when man &amp; wife are now no more two, but become one flesh. There is an Vnitie,
which is made by stabilitie; as when a man is constant in his vertue, whereby he
<PB N="303" REF="158">
is alwayes one, and like vnto himselfe. There is an vnity, which is made by
consent; as when, through Christian charity, there is found but one heart and one
minde in many. There is an vnity, that is made by deuotion; as when the soule
adhaering vnto God by piety and religion, is thereby made but one Spirit with
him. And there is an vnity, which is made by vouchsafing; as when God the
word vouchsafed to assume the nature of man, into the indentity of his owne
person.</HI> These bee the eight kindes of S. <HI>Bernards vnity:</HI> wherein I will not
censure, either any impropriety, or any coincidency: because they all may
well passe for seuerall kindes of Vnity, in the popular capacity. But yet hee
affirmeth of them all, that all these vnities are but to little purpose if they bee
compared to the <HI>Vnity</HI> of the <HI>Trinity;</HI> much more then being compared to
the <HI>Vnity</HI> of the <HI>Deity. Haec omnia</HI> (saith hee) <HI>quid ad illud summum, atque

vnities are as good as nothing, in respect of that vnity, which is found in the
Deity, by Consubstantiality. Huic vni, quiduis illorum si assimiles, erit quoquo
modo vnum: si compares, nullo. To this vnity, if you doe but liken any of those
forenamed vnities, they may, in some degree, be sayd to bee vnities: but, if you
compare them, in no degree at all.</HI> Whereupon hee there concludeth: <HI>Igitur,

writers. For his <HI>Simplicitie,</HI> for his <HI>Singularitie,</HI> and for his <HI>Vniuersalitie.</HI>
The first way, whereby God is sayd to be One, is, for the <HI>purity</HI> and <HI>simplicity</HI>
of his substance: which is not compounded with any thing els. For, that is
most truely and properly one, which is nothing but it selfe, and hath none
other thing mixed with it. <HI>Vnum enim quod est, syncerum est, &amp; mixtionis pu|rum,</HI>
sayth <HI>Plutarch.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. lib. de E, I. To. 2, p, 695.</NOTE> And such an one is God: who is so pure and simple an
essence, that he is not compounded so much as of parts. But, as I noted be|fore
out of <HI>Dionysius,</HI> he is truely called <HI>Vnus, propter simplicitatem vacuitatis
partium.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dionys. Arcopag. lib de diuin. Nom. c. 1, p, 192</NOTE> <HI>He is truely called One, because he hath no parts in him:</HI> but is solely
and wholly of his owne selfe a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">one, without any mixture, so much as of mat|ter,
as <HI>Plutarch</HI> affirmeth in his description of him. <HI>Deus est Mens, &amp; species
separata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. lib. de Pla|cit. c. 7. To. 2. p, 16.</NOTE> <HI>syncera ab omni materiae admixtione, perpessionibus obnoxiae. God is
a separated mind, or forme, who is pure from the mixture of any matter, which
may subiect him vnto any kind of passion.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Tully</HI> confirmes the same
in his description: which though in words it differ, yet, doth it not in mat|ter:
For he defineth God to be, <HI>Mens soluta, &amp; libera, segregata ab omni con|cretione
mortali,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. lib. 1. Tusc. p. 118. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">et. l. 1. de Trim. p. 1122.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So likewsse <HI>Boetius: Diuina substantia, sine materia, for|ma
est: at&abque; ide&ograve; vnum.</HI> So that, all of them run vpon this common notion:
<HI>That God is a pure substance, without any mixtion.</HI> Which his vncompounded
simplicitie, is the the true matter of his Vnitie: For, wheresoeuer is mixture,
there must needs be number. <HI>Diuersitas en&igrave;m, cum differentia enti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> ponitur:</HI>
sayth <HI>Plutarch:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plat. l. de E, l, p, 695,</NOTE> <HI>Where there be diuersities, there must needs be differences:</HI> and
consequently, <HI>numbers.</HI> And therefore <HI>Trismegistus</HI> sayth, that, <HI>Euery compound
body, is a multitude of bodies. Eorum, quae in mundo insunt, corporum, vnum|quod&abque;
est multitudo.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. Piman. Dial. 12, p, 452.</NOTE> And, <HI>In corporibus, quae composita sunt, corporis cuius&abque;
numerus est.</HI> So that, there is a number in euery mixture. And so, if there
were any mixture in God, he could not properly be one. Whereas now, his
simplicitie is the true cause of his vnitie. <HI>Quia nulla in eo diuersitas, nulla ex
diuersitate pluralitas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Boet. lib. 1. De Trinit. p. 1122.</NOTE> <HI>nulla ex accidentibus multitudo; at&abque; ideo nec numerus.</HI>
As <HI>Boetius</HI> well collecteth. <HI>There is in God no diuersitie, and therefore no plu|ralitie;
no multitude by accidents, and consequently no number.</HI> And this
<PB N="305" REF="159">
simplicitie of his substance, is the first of those three reasons, for which God
is called One.</P>
<P>The second is, from his <HI>Singularity;</HI> as the first was from his <HI>Simplicity.</HI>
Because there is no more Gods, but one; God is not onely one, but he is al|so,
<HI>The onely One.</HI> He is such an one, as hath no companion. Both which ti|tles
are expresly ascribed vnto God in the Scriptures: both that <HI>He is One,</HI>
and that he is <HI>The onely One.</HI> The first of them, by the Prophet <HI>Moses: Audi
Isra&euml;l,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 6. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Dominus Deus noster, Deus vnus est. The Lord our God is One God.</HI>
The second by the Prophet <HI>Isay:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 43. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Before me there was no God, neither shal there
be any after me.</HI> So that God is so one, that he is <HI>The onely one.</HI> He is not on|ly
<HI>vnus,</HI> but also <HI>vnicus:</HI> or, to vse S. <HI>Bernards</HI> word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernard, l. 5. de Consid. p, 1047.</NOTE> <HI>Si dici potest, vnissi|mus
est. If that word may be vsed, he is of all things, the Onest.</HI> And in respect
of this his <HI>Singularitie,</HI> because he is <HI>One,</HI> without any companion, is God
called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 1. de plac. c. 7. To. 1. p, 16.</NOTE> <HI>One,</HI> euen of the very Heathen. <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Plato,</HI> as before I noted,
in their definition of God, ascribe vnto him Vnitie, with particular respect
vnto his Singularitie. For, they define God to be, <HI>Vnum, singularis, &amp; per se
subsistentis naturae: To be one, of a singular and incommunicable nature: To be
by nature one,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de Nat. Deor. p, 188</NOTE> <HI>and of himselfe subsisting.</HI> So likewise <HI>Antisthenes,</HI> who di|rectly
affirmed, <HI>Populares esse Deos, multos; naturalem, vnum. That, though
there were many Gods, in popular opinion; yet that there is in nature, but onely
one.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de E. I. To. 1. mor. p. 695</NOTE> So likewise <HI>Plutarch:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 1. Saturnal. c. 23. p. 224.</NOTE> <HI>Non multa sunt Numina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luin. moral. poet. p, 1223.</NOTE> <HI>sed vnum. There be not
many Gods, but One.</HI> Which one God, he there thinketh to be the <HI>Sunne:</HI> as
<HI>Macrobius</HI> likewise doth: who applyeth all the names of the other Gods,
onely vnto him, as if he onely were all of them. <HI>Deus vnus, &amp; omnes,</HI> as
<HI>Varro</HI> speaketh: and they all, nothing else, but his seuerall names. Yea, and
<HI>Plutarch,</HI> in that place, collecteth the very same, out of two seuerall names
of the <HI>Sunne.</HI> The first, that he is called, <HI>Apollo: Qu&ograve;d Vnicus sit,</HI> (of <HI>Apri|uatiue,</HI>
and <GAP DESC="foreign">,) <HI>Voce multitudinis negationem arguente.</HI> The second, that
he is called <HI>Ieius:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 1. Satur. c. 7. p, 200 Varro. lib. 4 de Lingua Latina, p. 13.</NOTE> which soundeth as much as <HI>vnicus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Item Cic. l. 3. de Nat. Deor. p, 233.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; solus.</HI> Though
<HI>Macropedius</HI> interpret that name otherwise. So that there is but one <HI>God,</HI> as
there is but one <HI>Sunne:</HI> which therefore the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>Solem, quasi so|lum,</HI>
that is to say, <HI>The sole One.</HI> And so may God be called; likewise, for the
very same reason: as <HI>Boetius</HI> very wittily obserueth;
<Q><L>Quem, quia respicit omnia, Solus,</L>
<L>Verum possis dicere Solem.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boet. l. 5. de Con. Metro. 2. p, 1100</NOTE></L>
<L>Whom, 'cause he lookes to all,</L>
<L>Being solely one,</L>
<L>Thou mayst him truely call,</L>
<L>The very Sunne.</L></Q></P>
<P>And this is the second reason, why God is called One: in respect of his
<HI>Singularitie,</HI> because there is no other God, but <HI>He.</HI></P>
<P>The third is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruf. Comment. in Symbol. To. 1. p, 172. 1. Cor. 15. 28 Act, 17. 28 Io. Pic. Mirand. l. de Ente &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">no, p, 172</NOTE> in respect of his <HI>Vniuersalitie,</HI> because God is One, <HI>Non

as <HI>Ruffine</HI> distinguisheth. For he is indeede, all things. He is <HI>All in all:</HI>
as the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaketh. And as he is in all things: so all things are in him. <HI>In
him they liue, moue, and haue their being.</HI> So that, as <HI>Picus Mirandula</HI> obser|ueth
out of <HI>Dionysius: Vnum dicitur Deus, quia vnic&egrave; est omnia. God may be
<PB N="306" REF="160">
called one; because he onely is all things.</HI> An opinion maintained, by many
of the Heathen.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aert. in vita Xenoph. p, 310. Trismeg. Asclep. c. 1. p, 475.</NOTE> <HI>Xenophanes</HI> affirmed directly: <HI>Deum esse omnia: That God
was all things.</HI> And so likewise did <HI>Trismegistus; Omnia esse vnum, &amp; vnum
omnia: vt quae in Creatore fuerunt omnia, antequ&agrave;m creasset omnia.</HI> He saith,
<HI>That All things are One, and One is all: because they all were in their Maker,
before the time that hee made any of them.</HI> And thereupon hee concludeth,
that the name of God is, <HI>Omnia,</HI> that is, <HI>All things. Nec immerit&ograve; ipse dictus

aut omnia esse eius nomen; aut ipsum, omnium nominibus nuncupari. Either his
name must bee All things; or else, he must be named, by the name of all things.</HI>
So likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stob. l. Eclog. Phys c. 1. p, 2.</NOTE> both <HI>Zeno,</HI> and <HI>Melissus</HI> defined God to be, <HI>Et Vnum, &amp; omne:
To be One, that is All things.</HI></P>
<P>Which speeches of the Heathen, in making God <HI>All things,</HI> and in calling
him by all names; lest it should seeme to imply an vtter confusion of the
<HI>Creator</HI> with the <HI>Creature; Dionysius</HI> expresseth them both, in a more quali|fied
manner, bringing a commodious exposition, to mollifie the hardnes of
the position.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dionys. l. de Di|uin. Nom. cap, 1. p, 201.</NOTE> For he sayth, that God is, <HI>Omnia quae sunt, &amp; nihil eorum quae
sunt: He is, in some sense, all things that be; and yet, in another sense, none of
all the things that be.</HI> Now, in what sense it is, that hee calleth God, <HI>All
things;</HI> hee expoundeth himselfe, in the very same place: because, <HI>God is both
in mundo, circa mundum, &amp; supra mundum: He is, both in the World, about the
World,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. c. 13. p, 130.</NOTE> <HI>and aboue the World.</HI> And somewhat more fully, in another place:
because, <HI>in divina vnitate, singillat&igrave;m collecta &amp; coniuncta sunt omnia, prae|stanti
modo, &amp; ant&egrave;, eximi&egrave; insunt. Because all things had a being in God,
after a speciall, and most excellent manner, before they had any being in them|selues.</HI>
And in this sense it must bee taken, when they say; <HI>God is, Omnia.</HI>
And so likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. c. 1. p, 200.</NOTE> for his name: hee sayth, that <HI>God may bee praysed by vs; hoth
vt nomine vacantem, &amp; vt omni nomine: both as hauing no name, and yet as
hauing euery name:</HI> Because euery thing that hath a name, is the worke of
God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. lib. de vera Relig. c. 1. To. 1. p, 675.</NOTE> So that, to conclude this point with the sentence of S. <HI>Augustine:
Vnitas illa, &agrave; qua, omnis vniversitas &amp; inchoatur, &amp; perficitur, &amp; continetur,
est Vnus Deus. That Vnity, from whence the Vniuersality is both begunne, and
prefected, and praeserued, is onely the vnity of the Godhead.</HI> Wherein, though
there be a <HI>Trinity</HI> of persons; yet is there but an vnity of substance: yea and
that an indiuisible Vnity too.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dionys. l. de Di|uin. Nom. cap. 2. p, 204.</NOTE> For the Vnity of the Trinity, is, not onely,
<HI>Vnitas coniuncta;</HI> but also, <HI>plusqu&agrave;m coniuncta:</HI> as <HI>Dionysius</HI> truely noteth.
<HI>It is not an vnity conioyned,</HI> of things by nature differing: but <HI>more then con|ioyned,</HI>
of things in nature consenting.</P>
<P>4 Thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnity hath in it a resem|blance of God.</NOTE> <HI>Arithmeticall vnity,</HI> being rightly vnderstood, and fitly appli|ed,
doth leade vs, by the hand, vnto the knowledge of God. Yea, and as I
shewed before, of <HI>Punctum in Geometry;</HI> that it hath diuers lines, as mono|grammall
draughts of the image of God: so may the same be shewed in
<HI>Arithmeticall vnity.</HI> First, it hath a resemblance of Gods omnipotent po|wer:
whereby hee both maketh and destroyeth all things, at his pleasure. For,
as the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> affirmeth of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme, 104. 198.</NOTE> that, <HI>When hee sendeth forth his Spi|rit,
all things are created; and when hee but turnes his face, they are all a|gaine
<PB N="307" REF="160">
destroyed:</HI> so may it bee truely obserued of <HI>vnity;</HI> that it hath the like
power, among his numbers, that God almighty hath, among his Creatures.
For, all numbers haue, not onely their greatnesse and perfection, but also their
essence and being, from <HI>One.</HI> But <HI>it,</HI> from none. As for example. If you de|sire
to make <HI>Two,</HI> or a <HI>Binary,</HI> which is the first number: adde, but <HI>One,</HI> vnto
<HI>One,</HI> and you make <HI>Two.</HI> If <HI>Three,</HI> or a <HI>Ternary;</HI> adde but <HI>One,</HI> vnto <HI>Two;</HI> and
you make <HI>Three.</HI> And so, <HI>in infini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">um.</HI> Nay, the very name of all other
numbers, implieth no more, but so many <HI>Ones. An Hundred, A Thousand,
a Million,</HI> doth signifie no more, but an <HI>Hundred,</HI> a <HI>Thousand,</HI> and a <HI>Million of
Ones.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stob. l. Eclog. Phys. cap. 2 p, 3.</NOTE> For, <HI>Numerus</HI> is defined, by <HI>Moderatus Pythagoricus,</HI> to be nothing else,
but <HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dum congeries: All numbers are nothing, but a multitude of Ones.</HI>
So that, the very essence and being of all other numbers whatsoeuer, whe|ther
odde, or euen, dependeth but on <HI>One.</HI> Yea, and so doth likewise their
destruction, and dissolution. As we may euidently see, if wee will but walke
rerograde, the same way backe againe. For, take but <HI>One,</HI> from <HI>Three;</HI> and
you not onely vtterly destroy the odnesse, but also the essence of that num|ber.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Si quis a nume|ro vnitatem ab|stulerit, alius relinquetur nu|me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us. Arist. l. 1. de Anima, c, 4. To. 1. p, 792. Plut. l. de E. I. To. 1. p. 686.</NOTE>
And so likewise, from any other. <HI>From</HI> what number soeuer, you shall
take but <HI>one,</HI> you destroy his nature. And <HI>to</HI> what number soeuer, you shall
adde but one, you make it another. Take one from the greatest number, and
you make it lesse. Adde one to the least number, and you make it greater.
<HI>Take one from an odde number, and you make it euen. Adde one to an euen
number, and you make it odde. Vnitas, pari addita, imparem; impari, parem
conficit numerum,</HI> saith <HI>Plutarch.</HI> And therefore, in another place hee calleth
<HI>Vnity,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de Ani|mae, procreat, To. 3. p, 102.</NOTE> <HI>commune principium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. Pi|mand. Dial. 12. p, 452.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; parium, &amp; imparium: the common principle, of
euen, and odde.</HI> So that, both the creation, and destruction of all numbers,
dependeth wholy, vpon <HI>One. One</HI> is the maker, and <HI>One</HI> is the marrer of
euery number. <HI>Vnitates quipp&egrave; gignunt, at&abque; augent numerum: rurs&uacute;s&abque; solutae
inse numerum retrahunt:</HI> saith <HI>Trismegistus. Vnities added together, beget and
increase numbers: and againe dissolued asunder, reduce euery number into
themselues, and make of them vnities.</HI> Whereby it appeareth, that, as God
doth all, among his Creatures: so likewise doth <HI>Vnity,</HI> among all numbers:
which are, as it were, his Creatures, produced onely out of it selfe, by it's
owne foecundity, without borrowing any thing thereto, out of any other: as
God, in his Creation, produced all his workes, out of his owne omnipotent
power, and did not borrow any thing, from any Creature. For, <HI>Mathemati|cians</HI>
affirme that, <HI>Numerus par est mas; impar, foemina: The euen number is
the male;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 2. de Som: Scip. cap, 2. p, 88.</NOTE> <HI>and the odde the female:</HI> but, that, <HI>Monas est, &amp; par, &amp; impar:
Vnity is, both euen, and odde; masculine and feminine:</HI> and so that all numbers
are begotten of it, <HI>tanqu&agrave;m a mare &amp; a foemina: as of a male and a female.</HI>
Now this fruitefull <HI>Monas,</HI> which begetteth all things, is nothing else, but
<HI>God:</HI> as <HI>Trismegistus</HI> affirmeth; <HI>Deus vtrius&abque; sexus foecunditate plenissimus,
semper&abque; voluntate sua praegnans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. Asclep. c, 8. p, 506.</NOTE> <HI>parit, quicquid voluerit procreare. God who is
filled with the fruitefulnesse of both sexes, and alwayes pregnant, according to
his will produceth whatsoeuer his will is to haue produced.</HI></P>
<P>So that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">c, 1. p, 475.</NOTE> as in another place he affirmeth, he is <HI>Vnus omnia: Such an One
as is all things.</HI> Thus, in this point also, betweene <HI>Deitie, and Vnitie,</HI> there is
a great affinitie.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="161">
Secondly, there is in <HI>Vnity</HI> a representation of Gods abolute perfection.
For, as God hath his whole subsisting of himselfe, so that he cannot be made
either greater, or lesser, by any of his creatures: so likewise hath <HI>Vnity.</HI> It
hath his owne subsistence, absolutely in it selfe. For tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g the essence of all o|ther
numbers dependeth vpon One; yet the essence of one dependeth vpon
none. You cannot take any thing from one, to make it lesse: and you cannot
adde any thing to one, to make that one greater. For, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> truly tea|cheth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 13. Met. c. 8 To. 2.</NOTE>
<HI>Vnum,</HI> as it is not<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">p, 1522.</NOTE> <HI>Diuisibile:</HI> so is it not<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">p, 1520.</NOTE> <HI>Combinabile. Vnity can
neither be diuided nor increased.</HI> For, when One is added vnto One, there is
by their coniunction, produced another number; but yet neither of these two
vnities, is in it selfe, made greater, but abideth firme and stedfast, in his owne
stable nature; as God himselfe doth. And therefore, <HI>Iustin Martyr,</HI> euen in
this respect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iust. Mart. lib. Quaest. &amp; R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sp. Quaest. 113. To. 3. p, 137,</NOTE> compareth <HI>Vnitie</HI> vnto God. <HI>Quemadmod&ugrave;m vnitati, id nihil
confert ad perfectionem, qu&ograve;d principium sit numeri: (Nam etiamsi principi|um
numeri non esset, perfecta tamen esset: &amp; cum principium eius facta sit, non
aucta tamen est) sic Deus quoque, ante creationem perfectus erat, &amp; post crea|tionem
auctus non est. As it bringeth no perfection vnto an Vnity, that it is the
fountaine and beginning of numbers: (For though it were not the beginning of
any number, yet is an vnity perfect in its owne proper nature: and beeing the
fountaine and beginning of some number, it is thereby perfected neuer the
more) so God, who was perfect before the creation, yet is not made more perfect
by the creation.</HI> And this is the second degree of their comparison.</P>
<P>Thirdly, there is in Vnitie, a draught and resemblance of Gods <HI>Immuta|bilitie.</HI>
For, as God is alwayes like vnto himselfe, and not subiect to so much
as to <HI>a shadow of Change:</HI> no more is <HI>Vnitie</HI> neither. It is not variable, by <HI>pa|rity;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ia. 1. 17.</NOTE>
or <HI>imparitie;</HI> by multiplicity, or paucity; as all other numbers be: but it
still continueth, in its owne nature, immutably. An Vnity is alwayes at vnitie
with it selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. Pic. Mirand. in Heptaplo. l. 3. c. 1. p, 17.</NOTE> and neuer varieth from it selfe. <HI>Est Vnitas</HI> (saith <HI>Mirandula)
omnin&ograve; semper, &agrave; se perfecta, non egreditur se, sed indiuidua simplicitate, &amp;
solitaria sibi cohaeret. Vnity is simple and perfect in it selfe, neuer going out of
it selfe, but sticking vnto it selfe, vnchangeably, only by its owne sole and naturall
simplicity.</HI> So absolute is the nature of One, in it selfe, that it cannot be chan|ged;
and so omnipotent toward others, that it changeth all numbers. So
that <HI>Monas</HI> (as <HI>Trismegistus</HI> obserueth) <HI>tanquam principium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg Piman. Dial. 41. p, 396</NOTE> <HI>radix, &amp; ori|go,
omnem numerum continet, a nullo contenta; omnem gignit, a nullo genita.
Vnity containeth all numbers, beeing contayned of none; and it begetteth all,
being begotten of none.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, there is in Vnity, a true resemblance of Gods Eternitie, or An|tiquitie:
who is named in the Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 7. 9.</NOTE> <HI>The Auncient of Dayes.</HI> For, as God
is before all his creatures; so likwise is Vnitie before alll numbers. <HI>Sine vno,
multitudo non erit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dionys. l. de Nom. Diuin. c. 13. p, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 9.</NOTE> sayth <HI>Dionysius: Vnum autem erit, sine multitudine: Vt Mo|nas
omnem numerum multiplicatum &amp; auctum antecedit. There can be no mul|titude
without one, but one may be without a multitude: for, vnity is before any
multiplied number.</HI> Which antecedencie of Vnity, in the same place, he appli|eth
vnto the Deitie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">330.</NOTE> <HI>Vnum illud, quod est causa omnium, est omni vno, &amp;
multitudine, omni toto, &amp; parte, omni termino, &amp; determinationis priuatione,
omni fine &amp; infinitate antiquius. That one thing, which is the beginning of all
<PB N="309" REF="161">
things, is, in Nature before both all Ones, and all, Manyes, all wholes, all parts,
all termes, and all indeterminations, all finites and all infinites.</HI> It is more anci|ent,
then all these. Yea so ancient, that (as <HI>Macrobius</HI> affirmeth) it is without
all beginning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 1. in Som. Scip. c. 6. p. 16.</NOTE>. And therefore he hath reduced it directly vnto God, <HI>Haec
monas, initium, finis&abque; omnium, ne&abque;, ipsa principij finis&abque; sciens, ad summum
refertur Deum: That one thing, which is, both the beginning, and ende of all
things; and yet hath neither beginning, nor ende, in it selfe; cannot otherwise
be referred, but vnto the most High God.</HI> Who (as <HI>Mirandula</HI>

of <HI>Dionysius) ita rerum omnium principium est,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ic. Mir. l. de Ente &amp; Vno. p. 172.</NOTE> <HI>sicut omnium numerorum

<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the motion of the Heauens, and Starres, is not naturall. 2. Which yet
is so orderly, as if it were artificiall. That the order of their motion, hath
the resemblance of a Dance. 4. That the Heauens themselues, doe make
Musicke, to this Dance. That this orderly Motion of the Starres, hath led
diuers men, to seeke for a God, aboue the Starres. 6. Because their orderly
Motions, can neither be from Chance, nor from their owne Wills: But onely
from Gods Wisdome, who is the Maker of them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe third of the <HI>Mathematicall Arts,</HI> is <HI>Astronomie:</HI> whose
Obiect is, the <HI>Motion of the Heauenly Orbes, and Starres;</HI> where|in
there be many Arguments, which may leade men, by the
hand, to vnderstand, <HI>There is a God.</HI> But because I <HI>haue</HI> instan|ced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 2. Cap. 1. Sect. 1.</NOTE>
but onely in <HI>Order:</HI> I will therefore keepe order and wil
onely stand to it. And yet, in this place, I will but lightly touch it: because
in the <HI>seauenth Booke,</HI> there falleth out a more apt, and more ample conside|ration
of it.</P>
<P>First therefore, as concerning the <HI>Motion</HI> of the <HI>Heauens,</HI> it hath troubled
the <HI>Heads</HI> of the wisest <HI>Philosophers: of what Nature this Motion of the Hea|uens
should be? Tullie</HI> greatly approueth of <HI>Aristotles</HI> diuision, as concerning
<HI>Motion;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2, de Nat. Deor. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">07.</NOTE> That, <HI>Whatsoeuer things are moved, they must needs bee moved, either
by their owne natures; or, by force from others; or by a will in themselues.</HI>
Now, for the <HI>Heauens,</HI> he concludeth, that their motion cannot be natural,
because the Motion of all naturall Bodies, whether <HI>Simple</HI> or, <HI>Compound,</HI> is
either <HI>Vpward,</HI> or <HI>Downward.</HI> For, all Bodies are, either <HI>Light</HI> or, <HI>Heauy.</HI> If
<HI>Light,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. Phys. c. 9. To. 2. p. 440.</NOTE> they moue directly <HI>vpward,</HI> If <HI>Heauy,</HI> they moue perpendicularly
<HI>downward.</HI> And, there is not any naturall Bodie in the world, which is so
aequally compounded of <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Heauie,</HI> that it can hang in the midst,
and propend neither way. And therefore, the <HI>Heauens,</HI> if they were left vnto
the motion of their owne proper natures, they would either moue <HI>vpward,</HI>
or <HI>downward,</HI> as the <HI>Elements</HI> doe; or else they must stand still. For, other
<PB N="310" REF="162">
<HI>Motion,</HI> from their matter, they can haue none, as they be naturall Bodies.</P>
<P>No, nor yet from their Forme neither, as they bee teret and round Bodies.
For, though their <HI>Rotundity</HI> doth giue them an aptitude and disposition to
bee carried about in their circular motion; yet giueth it not the motion it
selfe vnto them. As we may see in a wheele: which (for all his roundnesse)
stands as still as a stone, if it haue not some other means to helpe it vnto mo|tion.
It may bee obiected; that the weightines of the wheele doth settle it
vpon his <HI>Axis,</HI> as in his proper place, where all things doe stand still. But it
may also bee answered; that the <HI>Heauens</HI> are in their proper place: and there|fore
should stand still, yea though they had in them the principle of motion:
much more, they hauing none. As indeed they haue not, if they bee of such
a temper, as is neither <HI>Heauy,</HI> nor <HI>Light.</HI> For, if we could imagine, that nature
had made any thing, so equally tempered, and indifferently poised, of <HI>Heauy,</HI>
and <HI>Light,</HI> that neither were predominant; it must needes hang in the midst,
and not mooue it selfe, either <HI>vpward,</HI> or <HI>downewards.</HI> Neither could it
moue about, in a circular motion; vnlesse it were impelled, by some other
thing. For, Nature hath made nothing, which hath, in it selfe, the proper
principle of circular motion. I meane, not as it is a Body. The rotundity of
their forme, that giueth onely, vnto them, an hability to that motion (as be|fore
I noted) but, the act, it giueth not. Neither can the vacuity of both
<HI>Heauinesse</HI> and <HI>Lightnesse,</HI> giue vnto them that motion: because, that is ra|ther
the principle of <HI>station,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iust. Mart. in Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">utat. dog|mat. Aristot. To. 1. p, 303.</NOTE> then of <HI>Motion.</HI> And (as <HI>Iustine Martyr</HI> very
well collecteth:) If the absence, or priuation of both <HI>Heauinesse</HI> and <HI>Lightnes,</HI>
were a formall cause of circular motion; then, <HI>Materia prima</HI> (which <HI>Aristotle</HI>
maketh, to bee neither <HI>light,</HI> nor <HI>heauy</HI>) should, from all eternity, haue moued
circularly: and so there should haue bene a motion, before there was any
Heauen. Which hee derideth there, most iustly, as a grosse absurdity.
But, if wee should grant: as <HI>Palingenius</HI> would haue vs:
<Q><L>&mdash;Coelestia corpora, per se,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palingen. in A|quario. p, 329.</NOTE></L>
<L>At&abque; suis formis; vt terra, ignis&abque; moueri:</L>
<L>That Heauenly bodies, of themselues, by their owne formes do moue,</L>
<L>As doth the Earth, that is below; and Fire, that is aboue.</L></Q>
Yet he teacheth vs, in the same place, that, it is onely God, that giueth them
their formes.</P>
<Q><L>Nempe suis, res, a formis, tales generantur:</L>
<L>Quales praecepit, qui formas condidit ipsas.</L>
<L>Yet such are things, by their owne formes begotten,</L>
<L>As He that made their formes,, doth please t'allot them.</L></Q>
<P>And therefore, the Orator proceedeth on further, vnto the other two
members, of his forenamed diuision of <HI>Motion.</HI> That this sphericall motion
of the heauens, not proceeding, in them, from any naturall principle, inhae|rent
in their bodies, it must needes, either be a violent motion, put vpon them
by an externall force, from some others; or else, a voluntary motion, occasi|oned
by an internall will in themselues. For, other principle, can be none, of
this circular motion. But, that it cannot be a motion, inforced vpon them,
hee assumeth from this ground: That there cannot bee any force, without
them, that is strong enough to compell them: there being no force that is
<PB N="311" REF="162">
greater then their owne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. vbi supr&agrave;.</NOTE> <HI>Quae enim vis potest esse maior? What force can bee
greater?</HI> And againe, <HI>Quid potest esse mundo valentius, quod impellat, atque
moueat? What power can be greater, then the power of the world, that should bee
able to mooue it?</HI> Hee supposeth (though falsely) that there can no such
power bee. And therefore hee concludeth, That the motion of the
Heauens, must be, of necessity, a motion meerly voluntary, proceeding from
nothing else, but onely from their owne wills. Whereupon hee there in|ferreth,
that, <HI>Haec qui videt, non sol&ugrave;m indoct&egrave;, sed etiam impi&egrave; faciet, si Deos
esse neget: That, this being admitted, he must not onely be vngodly, but also vn|learned
too, if hee deny them to be Gods:</HI> meaning, <HI>The Heauens</HI> and <HI>Starres.</HI>
This is the summe of his reason, from the motions of the Starres. Wherein,
though hee leade vs neuer so farre about; yet, at last, hee bringeth vs home
vnto our Conclusion: <HI>That there needs must be a God:</HI> and, that the Heauens,
by their motion, do plainely proue the same. An Argument largely handled
by the Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> in the 19. Psal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme 19.</NOTE> And though <HI>Tully,</HI> in that place, doe
bring the whole Argument vnto a false issue, building vpon a false ground;
<HI>That the motion of the Heauens is voluntary, and of themselues;</HI> and that <HI>there|fore,
They be Gods:</HI> though, I say, it be false, in the particular, <HI>That the Heauens
and Stars, be Gods;</HI> yet it is true in the generall, that it proueth most certainly,
that <HI>There needes must be a God;</HI> and, that this motion of the Heauens, can|not
possibly be stirred by any other cause, but onely by God himselfe.</P>
<P>For, if the motion of the Heauens (being admitted to be voluntary) doe
conclude <HI>them</HI> to bee Gods; then must needes the same motion (being ad|mitted
to be compulsory) much more conclude, that he, by whose force they
be so violently compelled, must needes be God. As, euen <HI>Plato</HI> himselfe hath
plainely confessed: from whom the former Argument of <HI>Tullies</HI> is borrow|ed.
<HI>Cogitemus</HI> (saith hee) <HI>qu&icirc; fieri possit, vt tanta magnitudo, ab aliqua possit
natura,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato, in Epi|nome p, 915.</NOTE> <HI>tanto tempore, circumferri? Ego igitur assero, Deum causam esse, nec ali|ter
posse fieri. Let vs consider</HI> (saith he) <HI>how it can possibly bee, that the Hea|uens,
being of so great and so vast a body, should, by any power of nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e dri|uen
so impetuously. And therefore</HI> (saith he) <HI>I do confidently affirme, that onely
God himselfe can bee the mouer of them.</HI> This is his determination, as con|cerning
the Heauens motion. And where is now that <HI>Soule</HI> of theirs; which,
but a little before, he made the mouer of them?</P>
<P>2 But let vs now proceede further, and come from the nature of their
motion to the Order.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The motion of the Starres is very orderly.</NOTE> Which is so great and excellent, that euen <HI>Aristotle</HI>
himselfe (who subiecteth all other matters, with a kinde of Tyranny, vnto
the power of his reasons) yet here (leauing reason) he sodainely breaketh out,
into a passionate admiration:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. de Mun|d. To. 2. p, 1565.</NOTE> <HI>Quid vnqu&agrave;m poterit aequari coelesti ordini, &amp;
volubilitati? C&ugrave;m sydera conuertantur exactissima norma, de alio in aliud secu|lum.
What can euer be compared vnto the order of the Heauens, &amp; to the motion
of the Stars, in their seuerall reuolutions? Which mooue most exactly, as it were,
by rule and square, from one generation to another.</HI> Which rule of their motion,
<HI>Dauid</HI> affirmeth to be <HI>Gods law, that he hath set them.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme 1486. Plato, in Timaeo. p. 710.</NOTE> <HI>God hath made them fast
for euer; he hath giuen them a law, which they cannot passe.</HI> And so likewise
doth <HI>Plato.</HI> For he saith, that God, when he had made the Starres, he did,
<HI>Singulis leges fatales edicere: He gaue vnto them fatall &amp; vnchangeable Lawes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="163">
And indeed, the very name of this Art, whereof we now intreat [the ve|ry
name of <HI>Astronomie</HI>] in exact signification, importeth, that the Starres
obserue <HI>a law</HI> in their motion. Which law is giuen vnto them, by none other,
but onely by God himselfe, who is their true <HI>Law-giuer.</HI> He is both their <HI>Ma|ker,</HI>
and their <HI>Law-maker.</HI> Yea, and this law of his, they obserue so exactly,
that (as the Orator obserueth) there is in all their motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. de Nat. Deor. p, 207.</NOTE> <HI>Nihil temerarium,
nihil varium, nihil fortuitum: They neither iustle rashly, one vpon another;
nor yet decline casually, one from another; no, nor vary in the least poynt, from
their prescribed order.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 2, de Som. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">p. c. 1 p. 83.</NOTE> For (as <HI>Macrobius</HI> likewise noteth) <HI>In Coelo, constat,

legibus, &amp; stata ratione procedere. There is nothing done casually, nothing
disorderly, in the heauens: but all things prescribed by most exact reason; and
determined by order of most diuine lawes.</HI> So that, hee ascribeth all the order
of their motion, vnto that law, which God hath prescribed them. And so
likewise doth <HI>Seneca:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. l. de prou. c. 1. p. 1&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> he saith, that the Starres doe, <HI>aeternae legis imperio pro|cedere:
They moue by the appoyntment of an eternall Law,</HI> that is, by the law
of an eternall God. Both of them agreeing with the Prophet <HI>Dauid,</HI> that the
onely cause of their orderly motion, is that exact law, which God hath pre|scribed
them. In which poynt, <HI>Tullie</HI> also consenteth fully with them. For
he, rendring a reason, why certaine of the Starres be called Planets: that is to
say, <HI>Wanderers:</HI> yet affirmeth, that it is not, because they wander in their
motion, but, because of that variety, which they haue aboue others. As for
their owne motions, they keepe so strict an order, and so great a constancie,
in obseruing of them, that they swerue not from that law, which God hath
prescribed them.

<P>But, <HI>Manilius,</HI> in this point, goeth farre beyond them all; both expresly

He giueth this for an Answer of their immutabilitie: that, <HI>it is the worke of
the immutable God.</HI>
<Q>&mdash;Deus est, qui non mutatur in aevo.</Q>
And indeed, it is a wonder, that these Planets, still running sometime in di|uers,
and sometime in aduerse courses; yet should all of them obserue, so
vnchangeably, their order, that they neuer should impeach, or hinder
one another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. Herc. Fur. Act. 5. p. 52.</NOTE> But though they doe, <HI>Transuersos agere cursus:</HI> as the <HI>Tragick</HI>
noteth, in one place: yet doe they,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 4. p. 37.</NOTE> <HI>Inoffensos,</HI> as hee noteth in another. <HI>They runne in crosse courses; and yet doe not crosse one another, in their
courses.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Epino|me. p. 915.</NOTE> <HI>Nec errant</HI> (saith <HI>Plato) nec praeter antiqunm ordinem reuoluuntur.
Neither doe they runne randon, nor are they rolled, beside their ancient
order.</HI></P>
<P>Which orderly motion of the Starres, both proueth, <HI>There is a God;</HI>
yea, and that this is his worke; by so necessarie a consequence, that whoso|euer
seeth it not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. De Nat. Deor. p. 209.</NOTE> him, <HI>Tullie</HI> affirmeth to be, without all sense. <HI>Coelestem

is ipse mentis expers habendus est. He which thinketh the admirable order and
incredible constancie of the Heauens to be without a Spirit, hee may be thought
himselfe to be without spirit or vnderstanding.</HI></P>
<P>3 And indeed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The motion of the Starres hath the resem+blance of a Daunce.</NOTE> the motions of the Starres, are in so great Varietie;
and yet obserued, with such order, and constancie; that they haue resemblance
of a well measured dance: some running directly, and forth-right, in their
courses; some dauncing round about, in their <HI>Epicycles.</HI> Yea, and that with
great varietie, and change of their motions, in <HI>Directions, Stations, Retrograda|tions,</HI>
and such like: wherein they doe seeme, as it were, to treade the <HI>Maze</HI>
and (in their kinde) to daunce their <HI>Measures.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. De Nat. Deor. p. 208.</NOTE> Of which, <HI>Tullie</HI> giueth in|stance,
in the Planet <HI>Saturnus. Saturni Stella, in suo cursu, multa mirabiliter

seculorum aetatibus, qu&igrave;n eadem ijsdem temporibus efficiat. The Planet
Saturne, doth make many strange and great wonders, in his motion, some|times
going before, and sometimes comming after, sometimes withdrawing
himselfe in the Euening, and sometimes againe shewing himselfe in the mor|ning:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. de Nat. Deor. p, 208. 215</NOTE>
<HI>And yet changeth nothing, neither in the order of times, nor in the
nature of things.</HI> And the like may be seene, in the rest of the <HI>Planets:</HI>
as he himselfe sheweth, in that very place. So that, <HI>Aristophanes</HI> his ob|seruation
<PB N="314" REF="164">
of the Clowdes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristop. in Nub. Act. 1. Sce. 3 p, 169. Plato in Timaeo, p, 709.</NOTE> is much truer in the Starres: that they doe, <HI>Arte
choream instituere. They make in their motions, an artificiall kind of Daun|ces.
Plato</HI> affirmeth, that God hath purposely prouided the Sunne to giue
the Starres light, the better to performe their well ordered motions: which
he calleth there, <HI>Their Daunces:</HI> where he also calleth their <HI>Courses, Deorum
choreas, The daunces of the Gods.</HI> For so he indeed esteemed of the Starres:
But <HI>Philo Iudaeus</HI> more truely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo Iud. l. de Cherub. p, 157.</NOTE> <HI>Diuinas choreas, Diuine and heauenly daunces.</HI>
For so, in a sort, they may truely be called: <HI>Diuinas reuera choreas agittantes,
nec vnquam ordinem deserentes. They daune in Gods presence</HI> (as <HI>Dauid</HI> did
before the Arke) <HI>and yet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 6. 14</NOTE> <HI>neither breake their orders, nor stray from their pla|ce.</HI>
So likewise <HI>Palingenius:</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Nec se collidunt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palin. in Aquar. p, 323.</NOTE> concutiunt&abque;,</L>

<P>Whence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Max. Tyr. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r. 25. p, 303.</NOTE> <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> calleth God, <HI>Coeli compositorem harmonicum,</HI>
and <HI>Astrorum circulationis, &amp; chorea, supremum moderatorem:</HI> ascribing vnto
him, <HI>the melody of the heauens, and the dauncing of the starres.</HI> And there|fore
<HI>Plato</HI> againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plat, in Epinome p. 915</NOTE> in another of his Dialogues, he sayth of the Starres, that
they doe <HI>Chorea optima vti, omnium&abque; chorearum magnificentissima: that
they daunce a most stately and magnificall daunce:</HI> harping still vpon their
dauncing. From whence, he there concludeth, That therefore they haue with|in
them, <HI>Mentem: a certaine spirit, or soule, that directeth them.</HI> And it is
true, in very deed. But it is not their owne spirit, as he falsely supposed: it is
onely Gods Spirit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 33. 6</NOTE> <HI>By the word of the Lord were the heauens made, and all
the host of them, by the breath of his mouth:</HI> sayth the Prophet <HI>Dauid.</HI> And so
likewise holy <HI>Iob:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 26. 13.</NOTE> <HI>His spirit hath garnished the Heauens, and his hand hath for|med
the crooked Serpent.</HI> So that, the Spirit, which giueth vnto the starres
their motion, is onely the Spirit, which giueth them their being. It is onely
that <HI>diuine Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 28</NOTE> in which <HI>all things both liue, and moue, and haue their be|ing.</HI>
Yea, and this is also confessed, euen by the very heathen. For, <HI>Tullie</HI> af|firmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. Acad. p, 7.</NOTE> <HI>that Soule of the world, to be nothing els, but</HI> god: <HI>and that by the

God.</HI> And againe, <HI>Democritus ait, Deum in igne globoso, esse mundi animam.
Democritus sayth, that God in the fiery globe, is the soule of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and <HI>Virgil,</HI> speaking of that <HI>Mens,</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> which giueth motion
vnto the heauens, he giueth such a description of it, as an agree to no Spi|rit,
but to the Spirit of God.

sitting vpon it, a Sweet-singing Syren, carolling-out a most pleasant and me|lodious
song, agreeing with the motion of her owne peculier heauen.</HI> Which
<HI>Syren,</HI> though it sing of it selfe, but one single part; yet all of them to|gether,
being eight in number (for so many Heauens were onely held by
the Ancients) doe make an excellent Song, consisting of eight parts:
wherein, they still modulate their Songs, a greeable with the motions of the
eight coelestiall Spheres.</P>
<P>Which opinion of <HI>Platoes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. b. l. 2. de Som. Scip. c. 3. p. 90.</NOTE> is not only allowed by <HI>Macrobius;</HI> but he also af|firmeth
of this <HI>Syrens Song,</HI> that, it is a <HI>Psalme,</HI> composed in the praise of God
<PB N="316" REF="165">
Yea, and he proueth his assertion out of the very name of a <HI>Syren:</HI> which sig|nifieth
(as he saith) as much as, <HI>Deo canens, A singer unto God.</HI> But <HI>Maxi|mus
Tyrius,</HI> he affirmeth of the Heauens, that (without any such helpe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Max. Tyr. Serm. 21. p, 256.</NOTE> of

doe fill vp all the parts of a most Divine and heauenly Song.</HI>
Which, hee affirmeth to be most pleasant vnto the eares of God; though it
cannot be heard by the eares of men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucian., lib. de Astrologi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; p, 166. B.</NOTE> Yea, and the <HI>Sages</HI> of the <HI>Greekes,</HI> insi|nuate
also as much, by placing of <HI>Orpheus</HI> his <HI>harpe,</HI> in Heauen: implying, in
the seauen strings of his well turned harpe, that sweete tune and harmonie,
which is made in heauen, by the diuers motions of the seauen planets, as
<HI>Lucian</HI> interprets it. Vnto which his opinion, there may seeme to be a kinde
of allusion, in the Booke of <HI>Iob,</HI> as the Text, in the vulgar translation, is ren|dered:

<P><HI>Pliny</HI> indeede, as concerning this <HI>Harmony,</HI> doth write somewhat doubt|fully;
whether there be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pliny lib 2. cap, 3. p, 1.</NOTE> in truth, any such thing, or no? suspending his owne
opinion, with <HI>Non facil&egrave; dixerim.</HI> So that, as hee doth not defend it, for a
veritie; so doth he not againe deny it, as a falsity; but leaueth it, as vncer|taine.
Whose doubting of it (he being of so acute, and inquiring a wit) is
rather a credit, then a discredit vnto it. But, much more is <HI>Aristotles</HI> deri|ding
of it: because (in the end) hee was forced to retract in. For, though in
his Booke, <HI>De Coelo,</HI> he confute it, and make, in a manner, but a scoffe, and
scorne of it; yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. de Coelo, c. 9. To. 1. p, 587.</NOTE> in his booke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. de Mun|do, To. 2. p. 1569.</NOTE> <HI>De Mundo,</HI> he alloweth of it, and confesseth
it to be the proper worke of God. For, there hee sayth expresly, that, God
doth, <HI>In mundo, rerum omnium concentum continere: That hee keepeth that
Harmony, which is to be found, in all the seuerall parts of the world.</HI> And so
likewise, <HI>Tully;</HI> although, in one place, hee doe scoffe at this <HI>Harmony,</HI> that
<HI>Mundus</HI> should <HI>ad harmoniam canere:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. de Nat. Deor. p, 229.</NOTE> <HI>That the World should sing vnto a tune:</HI>
yet, in another place, hee not onely subscribeth vnto it, but also, ascribeth vn|to
the working of it, all those benigne &amp; gracious influences, which, from the
Heauens, descend vpon these inferior bodies. <HI>Stellarum tantus est concentus, ex
dissimilimis motibus, vt c&ugrave;m summa Saturni refrigeret, media Martis incendat:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 2. de Nat. Deor. p, 218.</NOTE>

of the Starres, arising from the diuersity of their motions; that, as Sa|turne
cooleth, so Mars heateth, and Iupiter (which is betweene them) hee tempe|reth
them both. The other two Planets, which are below Mars, are both of them
obedient vnto the Sunne; which filleth the whole world with the cheerefull
light of it: Wherewith it illumining the body of the Moone, by it giueth power
of increase, and generation.</HI> Concluding, with these words, his former obser|uation:

(leauing all those Allegoricall allusions) asserteth this Harmony, vnto a
true and reall melody indeede; occasioned by the various motions, and dif|fering
magnitudes of the Heauens. Which, he saith&punc; must needes produce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 2. de Som. Scip. c. 1. p. 83. &amp;c.</NOTE>.

fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">enesse and subtility. Vnto whom I referre them, that desire a more curious
discourse vpon this Theame.</P>
<P>Neither is this an idle fancy, begotten onely in the heads of conceited
P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ilosophers; but it is also entertained, for a certaine truth, by diuers learned
<HI>Christians. Bed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> alledgeth this opinion, of the <HI>Harmony</HI> of <HI>Heauen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beda, lib. de Musica practi|ca, To. 1. p, 417.</NOTE> for the
credit of <HI>Musicke.</HI> Which hee would neuer haue done, if he had not allowed
of it. <HI>Boetius</HI> doubteth not, directly to affirme it: yea, and to proue it too:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boetius, l de Musica. c. 2. p, 1374.</NOTE>
<HI>Non potest, ab hac coelesti vertigine, ratus ordo modulationis, absistere.</HI> But, a|boue
all, <HI>Anselmus,</HI> though otherwise a seuere and a very austere man; yet is
so sweetened, and mollified with the conceite of this <HI>Musicke,</HI> that hee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anselm l. de Imagine Mundi. cap. 24. To. 3. p, 300.</NOTE> not
onely asseuereth it; but also indeauoureth, with great paines and la|bour,
to set out the true musicall proportion of it: as <HI>Macrobius</HI> be|fore
did.</P>
<P>Now, it is no lesse vnprobable, that so many learned men, of so many dif|fering
bot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ages and nations, should concurre, with such an harmony, in de|fending
of this <HI>Harmony,</HI> if it were merely fained; then it is, that there should
bee such an <HI>Harmony,</HI> indeede. <HI>Neg, en&igrave;m hunc, tam certum syderum cursum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. l. de Pro|uidentia, c, 1. p, 1.</NOTE>

they doe not, <HI>sine aliquo Custode stare;</HI> but, <HI>aeternae legis imperio proce|dere:</HI>
as hee noteth in the same place: <HI>They neither keepe their stations, with|out
a Keeper; nor mooue their motions, without a Ruler: whose aeternall law they
faithfully obey.</HI></P>
<P>And, it was a thing no more hard vnto God, to make the Heauens to
moue with a sweete melodious harmony, then to make them moue without
it. For, if Queene <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> when she came vnto <HI>Antonius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in vita Anton. To. 3. p, 148.</NOTE> could instruct
the <HI>Oare-men,</HI> and Rowers of her Barge, to strike all their strokes, in such or|der
and number, that they made a most sweete harmony and concent, vpon
the water, as exactly agreeing with her musicall instruments, as the sound of a
<HI>Taber</HI> agreeth with his <HI>Pipes</HI> (an Art also in practice sometimes, among
the Greekes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Max. Tyr. Serm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">3. p. 280.</NOTE> as may be collected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wis. 11. 17.</NOTE> out of <HI>Maximus Tyrius:</HI>) then much more
can God doe so: who ordereth all his workes, both in <HI>Number, Weight, and
Measure.</HI> It is not hard for him, in such sort to moderate, yea and to modu|late,
the Heauens, as to make them, to send fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th a sweete harmony, in their
motions.</P>
<P>Yea, and it is not incredible, that hee hath also done it. For, seeing it is
vnpossible, that this so huge and vast a fabricke of the Heauens, being truely
<PB N="318" REF="166">
materiall and sensible bodies, and whirled about with such incredible swift|nes,
should moue without some noyse:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. de Coe|lo, c. 9. To. 1. p, 567.</NOTE> as <HI>Pythagoras</HI> well collecteth: and
that noyse (as <HI>Macrobius</HI> truely inferreth) must be of necessity, either sweete
and melodious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 2. de Coe|lo, c. 9. To. 2. p, 587.</NOTE> or harsh and absonous [<HI>aut musicum, aut asperum:</HI>] it is far
more probable, that, that sound, which God hath chosen to sound continu|ally
in his diuine Eares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">b. l. 2. de Som. Scip. c. 1. p. 83.</NOTE> should rather be tuned, like the sound of sweete Mu|sicke,
then harsh and confused, like the creaking of a Cart. For (as <HI>Macrobi|us</HI>
in the same place, obserueth) <HI>Fragor turbidus, &amp; inconditus, offendit au|ditum.
An harsh and rude crashing of things, offendeth the eare.</HI> And there|fore
it is not likely to be found in the Heauen. In which, as there is <HI>Nihil for|tuitum:</HI>
so is there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>Nihil tumultuarium: As there is nothing done rashly; so
there is nothing done disorderly.</HI> And, it cannot, in any probabilitie, be
thought, that God, who hath appointed vs, in our singing vpon Earth, <HI>To
make a pleasant melodie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 19.</NOTE> <HI>and to sing vnto him with a grace in our hearts;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3. 16.</NOTE>
would admit into the heauens themselues, any such vntuneable and incom|posed
noyse, as hath neither any grace nor melodie in it.</P>
<P>But this I doe not affirme, as a certainty; but onely propose as a probabi|litie:
leauing euery man vnto his owne liberty, to beleeue it, or not to be|leeue
it, as he findeth himselfe most inclined in his mind: Apologizing for

<P>Therefore, be this opinion of the <HI>Harmony of the Heauens,</HI> as it may; be it,
but <HI>Lepid&egrave; quidem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. lib. 2. de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. c. 9. To. 1. p. 587.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; music&egrave; dictum, factu autem impossibile,</HI> as <HI>Aristotle</HI>
censureth it: that is: <HI>but a pleasant and musicall conceit:</HI> Yet this so excellent
a concent and agreement in the heauens, to keepe so constantly, their seuerall
rankes and orders (notwithstanding the diuersitie of their courses) is a work,
which by themselues, cannot possibly be done, no more, then any musicall
Instrument can put it selfe into tune. It is <HI>God the Musitian</HI> (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> be|fore
calleth him) that keepeth all in tune.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. lib. de primo frigido. To. 2. p. 615.</NOTE> His power keepeth them all in o|bedience:
His wisedome guideth them all in their courses: and, his good|nesse
maketh them to produce those good effects, which they worke in the
earth, and in these inferior Bodies. And therefore, euen <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe,
who derideth so much the <HI>Harmony of the Heauens,</HI> in any real sounds; yet,
in respect of this harmonicall concent in the creatures, he so much admireth
it, that he compareth God, in his working of it, vnto a <HI>Praecentor</HI> in a <HI>Quire:</HI>
who both appointeth and moderateth all the Songs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. de mun|do. To. 2. p, 1570.</NOTE> that be sung there. All
which things declare, that God, as he is delighted in order, so is hee likewise
delighted in number: Yea and in <HI>musicall number</HI> too. In which opinion <HI>An|selmus</HI>
is carried so farre, that he, not onely affirmeth, that God hath giuen
to the heauens an harmonicall number, in their motions; but also from
thence collecteth, that God hath, in his kind, an harmonicall motion euen
in himselfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anselm. in pros|olog. cap. 17. To. 3. p, 32.</NOTE> <HI>Habes haec in te, tuo ineffabili modo, qui ea dedisti rebus, a te crea|tis,

<HI>Suidas</HI> affirmeth, that, euen <HI>Abraham</HI> himselfe, was first occasioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suidas in voce Abraham p. 6.</NOTE> to seeke

and yet no lesse a constancie, he presently collected, that these strange
reuolutions could not possibly be performed, if they were not directed, and
guided, by some God. So that, his first motiue, to seeke after God, was, that
orderly motion, which he saw the Starres obserued. Yea and <HI>Orpheus</HI> him|selfe

He, being a great <HI>Astronomer,</HI> and obseruer of the Starres, was led, by his

haue beene nothing else, in truth, but onely the ascending of his minde, in

<P>But yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The motion of the Starres, is not by their owne will, but by Gods.</NOTE> a greater Question remaines still behind: By whose wisdome it

Yeelding, that, if it be not by the former, then, it must be, by the latter.
But, by the former, it is not. It is not by motion, of their owne will,
or reason. For they haue none in them. They are so farre from being,
either the <HI>Authors,</HI> or <HI>Directors,</HI> of their owne proper motions; as that
they vnderstand not, so much, as that they mooue at all: as euen <HI>Lucretius</HI>

so precisely to the poynt, that in the least iot, hee neuer erreth from it.

<HI>in his going downe.</HI> Which he likewise affirmeth, of all the other Starres: who
yet haue no more sense or knowledge of their seuerall motions, then an arrow
in the ayre knoweth, whither it flyeth; or, a ship in the water, whither it say|leth;
or, a Chariot on the earth, whither it runneth. And yet, as when we
see an arrow, to fly directly to any marke, whereunto it is aymed; though
we see not the Archer, by whom it was shot; yet must we know, in reason,
that it surely was directed by some skilfull person; because it goeth so direct|ly,
hauing yet no skill to direct it selfe: so, when we see the heauens to pro|duce
vpon the earth, so many good effects, by yeelding vnto it such fruitfull
season.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 8. 22.</NOTE> and bringing out of it such plenty and variety of excellent fruites,
whereby both men and beasts are nourished: and that they, ayming at this
end, doe neuer faile to hit their marke: wee needes must vnderstand (if wee
haue any vnderstanding) that this course is directed, by some heauenly <HI>Sa|gittarius,</HI>
indued with excellent skill, and reason. For, as <HI>Aquinas</HI> well ob|serueth,
insisting vpon this very comparison:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquin. 1. Quaest. 105. Arct. 1. p. 218.</NOTE> <HI>Sicut motus Sagittae ad determi|natum

declareth, that it was shot by one, that well knew, whereunto he had aymed it: so
the certaine mouing of all naturall things, which know not themselues any thing
of their owne motion, declareth, that they are moued, by on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> that hath vnderstan|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ng.</HI>
And so likewise, for the other two comparisons. When we behold a ship,
to winde, and to turne, and to fetch about, so diuersly; and yet to come, at
last, into that very hauen, which it intended, at the first: wee must needs
know as certainly, that it is guided by the reason of some skilfull Pilot, as
we certainly know, that it hath no proper reason of it owne, to guide it: as
<HI>Theophilus Antiochenns</HI> obserueth, insisting vpon this second Comparison.
<HI>Quemadmod&ugrave;m enim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theoph. Antioch. l. 1. ad Autolic. Bib. Pat. To. 5. p. 125.</NOTE> <HI>si quis cernat navem, suis armamentis instructam, mare

hath, within her, some cunning and skilfull gouernour: So, no man can be so
abiectly minded, but he must needs know, God to be the Governour of all things,
though he doe not behold him, with his bodily eyes.</HI></P>
<P>And so likewise it is, in the mouing of a Chariot. It cannot goe whither
it is purposely intended, if it haue not some skilfull driuer, to direct it. In
like case, the Heauens themselues, they could neuer moue, so orderly, and
directly, in their courses, if God himselfe were not the ruler, &amp; director of their
motions: <HI>quasi Auriga, habenas, &amp; gubernator, clavum tenens</HI> (saith <HI>Philo Iu|daeus,</HI>
insisting vpon this third comparison) <HI>holding their raynes, like their
Driuer, and their helme, like their Gouernour.</HI> So that, though we grant, that
the motion of the Heauens;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo Iud. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. de Mundi opific. p. 13.</NOTE> is performed by excellent arte and wisdome;
yet is it not, by their owne wisdome; but, by the arte and wisdome of that
ruler,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lact. l. 2. c. 5. p. 8. 4.</NOTE> that guideth them. As <HI>Lactantius</HI> plainely sheweth, by the Sphere of
<HI>Archimedes.</HI> Wherein, though there were great arte and wisedome vsed, to
make that Sphere moue so artificially, and orderly; yet was not that wisdome
in the Sphere it selfe; but, in the Maker of it, that so cunningly contri|ued
it.</P>
<P>And so is it likewise, with the Heauens. Their turning, and returning, so
swiftly, so orderly, so constantly, to so many good effects, as they bring forth
in the earth, doth manifestly shew, that their motion must needs be ruled
by prouidence and wisdome. But yet, that wisdome, is not in themselues,
that <HI>haue</HI> those motions; but, in their maker, that <HI>gaue</HI> them. There is not
in themselues, <HI>Sensus officij sui, sciens: any sense, or vnderstanding of those
offices,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 83. Ibid. p. 84.</NOTE> <HI>which they performe.</HI> But they compasse all their motions, <HI>Non suo

whence he truly concludeth, that, <HI>Inest syderibus ratio, ad peragendos motus
suos: sed Dei est illa ratio, qui &amp; fecit, &amp; regitomnia; non ipsorum syderum,
quee mouentur. The Stars doe shew great wisdome, in the performing of their
motion: but it is none of their owne. It is the wisdome of God, who both made,
and ruleth euery thing.</HI> So that, it may truely be sayd of the Heauens, as it
was of a carued wooden head: that there is in them, <HI>Artis multum, sed sen|sus

no sense at all of their owne mouing.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aesop. fab.</NOTE> And, though <HI>Seneca</HI> deride it, as a

doe in a Clock. And therefore <HI>Tullie</HI> himselfe (euen from this very compa|rison)
concludeth, that it needs must be from God, that they receiue all their
motion. <HI>An c&ugrave;m machinatione quadam moueri aliquid videmus, vt Sphaeram,

When we see anything moued by an artificiall engine, as a Sphere, or a Clocke,
or any other such like thing, wee neuer make any doubt, but that those Workes
were wrought by reason: And, can wee then doubt, when we see the heauens to
mooue, with such incredible celerity, and yet to keepe their yearely courses, with
such admirable constancy, procuring vnto all things, both their health, and safe|ty,
that this must be the worke, not onely of reason, but also of Diuine, and most
excellent Reason?</HI> Ascribing the regularity of their motion, not vnto their
owne, but vnto <HI>Diuine Wisdome.</HI> In which sentence, though it should bee
thought, that <HI>Tully</HI> doth but <HI>Platonize,</HI> implying [by <HI>Diuine Wisdome</HI>] none
other, but their owne, as reckoning the Starres themselues, to be Gods: yet,
euen so, it proues the Cause: that the motions of the Heauens being so
constant, and orderly, cannot otherwise bee stirred, but by the wisedome of
God. And consequently, that it sheweth, that there needes must be a God.
Yea, and in another place, hee goeth further, affirming of this so apt and or|derly
a motion, that it not onely cannot bee performed, in the naturall hea|uen,
without the power and wisedome of a God; but also, not to bee imita|ted,
by <HI>Archimedes,</HI> in his Artificiall heauen, without a diuine illumination

sentence of his, cannot bee vnderstood, of the fore-named <HI>Star-Gods;</HI> but of

fancie, yet speaketh of it, but weakely, and doubtfully. For hee, (not

draw his beginning. Which hee proueth to bee false, by the force of two
reasons, The first whereof, is this: That, if they had this perpetuall motion,

This must needes be very yrkesome, to continue still in one and the same
motion, without any alteration: especially, to any thing, that hath a soule, in|dued
with either sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Ciuili. p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">duobus a principio folijs.</NOTE> or reason. And therefore, <HI>Plato</HI> affirmeth, that,
<HI>Seipsum semper convertere, ferm&egrave; nihil potest; praeter id, quod cursum, agitatis
omnibus, praestat. That nothing can endure, to turne about it selfe euer; but
onely that one thing, which giueth motion to all things.</HI> Whereupon, he there
concludeth: <HI>Mundum seipsum non convertere semper:</HI> putting the
doubt, out of doubt: <HI>That the motion of the Heauens is not voluntary
of themselues.</HI></P>
<P>His second Reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. de Coelo c. 8. To. 1. p. 587.</NOTE> is this; that, <HI>Nature hath not giuen a voluntary or ani|mal-motion
vnto any thing, but shee hath also giuen it fit meanes and instru|ments,
to exercise the same:</HI> as feete, vnto Beasts; wings, vnto Birds: and
sinnes, vnto Fishes; and such like. But, vnto the Starres shee hath giuen no
such instruments, but made them round and teret, like a globe, as if shee had
purposely depriued them of all the meanes of voluntarie motion. <HI>Vniversa
videtur, tanquam de industria, abstulisse, quibus per se procedere ipsa possent.</HI>
<PB N="327" REF="170">
From whence hee collecteth, that <HI>Nature</HI> neuer intended to bestow vpon
them any voluntarie motion. <HI>Ne&abque;o enim animalia ipsi curae <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">u&ecirc;re, ade&ograve; ver&ograve;
praestabiles res despexit. Vnlesse we should imagine, that Nature, which hath
shewed such a care ouer these earthly Creatures, would carelesly praetermit, or
despise those Heauenly.</HI> This is the whole summe of <HI>Aristotles</HI> reasons, to
proue, that the Starres haue no voluntarie motions. <HI>Plato</HI> indeed rendereth
a reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. in Timaeo.</NOTE> why the Heauens haue no neede of any instruments of motion;
as Legges, or Feete. But they be such, as shew plainely, that their motion is
not voluntarie.</P>
<P>Now, to recollect the summe of this long Chapter: If this regular, and or|derly
motion of the Starres, be, neither naturally giuen vnto them, either by
their <HI>Matter,</HI> or by their <HI>Forme:</HI> nor accidentally fallen vpon them, either
by <HI>Chance,</HI> or <HI>Fortune:</HI> nor voluntarily composed by them, out of their
owne election: then must it needs be imposed vpon them, by diuine con|stitution:
as <HI>Plutarch</HI> truely collecteth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 1. de placit. Philosoph. c. 1. p. 4.</NOTE> accompting this for a sufficient enu|meration.
But, the three former branches are largely proued, in three Secti|ons
of this Chapter. And therefore, the Author of their motions, must needs
be God himselfe. It can be none other. Whom <HI>Boetius</HI> truly calleth, <HI>&mdash;Terra|rum,

<P>_WE are now, at the last, come vnto the last of the Mathematicall

not to discourse, as a curious <HI>Musitian,</HI> but as a <HI>Diuine.</HI> And

you, which I haue summed vp before, in the contents of this Chapter. And
that but very lightly; to auoyd all curiositie.</P>
<P>First therefore, for the first of them. It was <HI>Pythagoras</HI> his position: <HI>Vniversi,
naturam Musicis fuisse rationibus fabricatam:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Athenaeus. lib. 14. p, 471.</NOTE> <HI>That the frame of this whole
world, is made, in a kind of naturall Musick.</HI> And the most of the old
<HI>Philosophers</HI> (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> reporteth) concurred with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. lib. de Mu|sita. To. 2. p, 708.</NOTE> in the very same
opinion: <HI>A Deo omnia fuisse instituta, secund&ugrave;m Harmoniam: That God hath
made all his workes, exactly, vnto the due proportion of a Musicall Harmonie.</HI>
And we may see it plainely verified, if we will take a Suruey, of all the Crea|tures
of God; beginning which the highest, and so, by degrees, descending
the lowest.</P>
<P>And first, for the Heauens, the highest of Gods workes: I haue partly
shewed <HI>before,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Harmony of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eauens lib. 2, c. 11. Sect. 4.</NOTE> in the former Chapter, what an excellent Harmonie God

their influences, I doe leaue the former of those Harmonies, to the libertie
of the Readers, to beleeue, or not beleeue, as it pleaseth themselues. But,
this latter of them, is a thing so euident, of their gracious influences vpon
these inferior Bodies; that he must needs be destitute, both of sense, and
reason, that denieth it. Neither, doe the <HI>Philosophers,</HI> only beleeue the <HI>body</HI>
of the Heauens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 2. de Som. Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">p. c 3. p, 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> 92.</NOTE> are made, in musicall proportion; but also, that their <HI>soules</HI>
and <HI>Intelligences,</HI> from whence they haue their motion, are also made, by
the same composition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Timaeo, p, 707.</NOTE> <HI>Plato,</HI> describing the Creation of the <HI>Soule</HI> of the
world, he setteth downe exactly, all the seuerall substances, whereof it is

hath taken great pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nes, to expresse more plainely, that which was deliuered
by <HI>Plato</HI> more obscurely; as concerning both the <HI>Matters,</HI> and the <HI>Mea|sures,</HI>
of the Soules composition: which hee reduceth exactly, vnto <HI>Musi|call</HI>
proportion: Yea and further ascribeth, all the <HI>Musicall</HI> Harmonie of
the Heauens themselues, onely vnto that musicall composition, which God
gaue vnto the soule of the Heauens, in his first Creation. <HI>Erg&ograve;, Mundi a|nima,

World, which stirreth the bodie of the World vnto motion, being it selfe made
of such numbers, as beget in it selfe, a musicall Harmonie; must needs, in all
those motions, which it selfe procureth, produce a musicall Harmonie likewise.</HI>
Yea, and a little after, hee attributeth vnto this musicall Composition of that
soule, not onely the Harmonicall motion of the Heauens, but also, all that
delight in <HI>Musicke,</HI> which all liuing Creatures does take, here vpon the earth.
<HI>Iure igitur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. c. 3. p. 91.</NOTE> <HI>Music&aacute; capitur omne quod viuit; quia coelestis anima, qua anima|tur

hath life, be delighted with Musicke; because the soule of the world, which giueth
them their life, is it selfe compounded of a kind of Musick.</HI> This is the con|ceit,
which the ancient <HI>Philosophers</HI> haue had, of the <HI>Musick</HI> and Harmonie
of the Heauens, not onely in their <HI>Bodies,</HI> but also in their <HI>Soules.</HI> All of
them proceeding onely, from that diuine and heauenly Harmonie, which

called a Musition, for his skilfull tempering of the ayre, and his effects, in these

of Heate, and Cold, in the World; that be maketh them, both to come together,
and to depart asunder, in a very wholsome and temperate manner.</HI> This calleth
he, Gods <HI>Musicke:</HI> which is, indeede, most pleasant, yea, and no lesse profi|table,

the contrarie Qualities of the Elements together, that, as <HI>Manilius</HI> tru|ly

frame of this world, you shall finde, with how great wisdome, the same hath bene
wrought, and how aptly, how fitly, and decently, composed. For therein, not only
like things preserue peace and vnity; but also things contrary do ioyne league and
amity.</HI> And then hee proceedeth to exemplifie his meaning, by our present
instance of the Harmonicall mixture of the Elements. <HI>Quid repugnatius esse

What is more contrary in Nature, then Fire, and water? which yet are so
farre from breaking the bond of their common coniunction, that, by a ioynt
consent, they minister vnto all things, their vitall food, and nourishment?</HI> This
is the Harmony of the Elements, consisting all of <HI>Concords.</HI></P>
<P>Now, beside this, they haue another, which consisteth all of <HI>Discords.</HI> And
that is, when any one of them doth either exceede their due proportion,
which worketh a discord in all those bodies, that are compounded of them,
and tendeth directly vnto their dissolution: or, when they digresse from
their right and naturall vses, and turne their benefits into punishments.
Which oftentimes is done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 9. 31. &amp; 7. 19. 20. 21. &amp; 8. 24. 13. 14.</NOTE> for the sinne of man. As it was, to the <HI>Aegyptians:</HI>
when the fire descended, and destroyed their fruite: the water putrified, and
turned into blood: the aire was poisoned, with noysome flyes: and the earth
corrupted, with the stinke of their froggs. Here was a great change, from
that sweete and melodious tune, which God intended in their first Creation,
into an harsh and vnpleasant one. But yet, euen in this change of their tune,
they kept still a good harmony; and harmony concording with Gods seue|rity,
though somewhat discording with his mercy. As the <HI>Wiseman</HI> obser|ueth,
in the booke of <HI>Wisedome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisd. 19. 17.</NOTE> where be expresseth that perturbation, by this
very comparison. <HI>The Elements</HI> (saith he) <HI>greed among themselues, in this
change, as when one tune is changed vpon an instrument of Musicke, and yet
<PB N="331" REF="172">
the melody still preserued.</HI> These be the two <HI>Harmonies</HI> of the <HI>Elements.</HI></P>
<P>Let vs now descend, as yet one steppe lower, vnto those compounded Bo|dies,
which are made of their mixtures: and we shall see, that God hath gi|uen
the like <HI>Harmonies</HI> vnto them. First an <HI>Harmonie</HI> of <HI>Concords;</HI> which
euidently appeareth in that amicable and louing agreement, that is seene be|tweene
all the parts of their bodies, in seruing, and cherishing, and comfor|ting
one another: which they doe, and performe, with that true sympathy
&amp; compassion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 12. 26.</NOTE> that, <HI>if one member suffer, all the rest do suffer with it: &amp;, if one
be had in honour, al the rest reioyce with it.</HI> And diuers other notes there be
of a singular symphonie and agreement betweene them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hugo. de vict. l. 7. Erudit. didasc c. 4. To. 3. p. 18. N</NOTE> Wherein, as <HI>Hugo de

vt nullum omnin&ograve; possit inveniri membrum, cuius officum alteri non videa|tur
afferre adminiculum. Al the members of the body, are ioyned together, in so lo|uing
an vnitie, that there is not any of them, but that in discharging his own proper
office, it bringeth also some helpe vnto his other fellow-members.</HI> Whereupon he
there concludeth: <HI>Sic omnis natura se diligit, &amp; miro quodam modo plurium
dissimilium in vnum redactorum concordia, vnam in omnibus Harmoniam
facit. Thus euerything, by nature, is louing to it selfe, and by ioyning things
vnlike in true concord together, after an admirable manner, it maketh, in the
whole body, a most sweete and pleasant Harmonie.</HI> This Harmonie of <HI>Concords</HI>
hath God generally disposed, <HI>into the parts &amp; members of al co~pounded bodies.</HI></P>

beget in the world, a most sweet &amp; wholesome Concord. I meane, not only of
those <HI>Sympathies,</HI> and <HI>Antipathies,</HI> which God hath planted in diuers of his

(A secret in nature, whereof the learnedest men were neuer yet able to
giue any reason (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> truly noteth, <HI>Aelianus</HI> confirmeth) but, euen in the
other most common &amp; ordinary workes of God, we shal finde none of them so
free, but that it hath in nature, in some sort, his contrarie. So that, the frame of
the whole world, doth seeme to benothing else, but only a mixture &amp; compo|sition
of <HI>Contraries:</HI> striuing stil together, (though in more orderly manner) as
they did in the masse of their confused <HI>Chaos:</HI> wherein, as the <HI>Poet</HI> describeth it,

And such is still the fight and conflict of contraries, euen in this well ordered
and beautifull world, though the same hand, which then distinguished them
into their seuerall orders, doth now so moderate and keepe them in order,
that their contraries and repugnancies tende, both vnto the safetie, and beauty
of the world; and not, either to the hurte, or to the blemish of it. In which
respect, <HI>S. Augustine</HI> compareth that <HI>Naturall order,</HI> which God hath taken,
<PB N="332" REF="173">
in mingling of <HI>Contraries,</HI> through all the rancks of his Creatures, to that
<HI>artificiall order,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. l. 11. de Civit. Dei. c. 18. To. 5. p. 630.</NOTE> which <HI>Musitions</HI> ofttimes take, in the making of their <HI>Songs.
Deus ordinem seculorum, tanqu&agrave;m pulcherrimum carmen, ex quibusdam quasi
Antithetis, honest avit. God hath framed and compounded the order of the vni|uerse,
in the manner of a curious &amp; elegant verse; artificially adorned with mem|bers,
all of Contraries. Like that sentence of S. Paules: By Honour &amp; dishonour
by euill report,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 6. 8. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; good report; as deceiuers, &amp; yet true; as vnknown, &amp; yet known
as dying, &amp; yet behold we liue; as chastened, &amp; yet not killed; as sorrowing, &amp; yet
alwayes reioycing; as poore, &amp; yet making many rich; as hauing nothing, and yet
possessing all things.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Terent. E. unuch Act. 2. Sce. 2. p. 61. a.</NOTE> Not vnlike that of <HI>Terence: Omnia habeo, ne&abque; quicquam ha|beo,
nihil c&ugrave;m est, nihil deest tamen.</HI> Whereupon S. <HI>Augustine,</HI> in the same place,
concludeth, that, <HI>Sicut contraria contrarijs opposita sermonibus pluchritudinem
reddunt; ita, quadam, non verborum, sed rerum, eloquentia, contrariorum appo|sitione,
seculi pulchritudo componitur. As contraries, opposed vnto contraries, do
yeeld a kind of grace &amp; beautie to the speech, so God, by placing contraries against
their contraries, in a kinde, not of verbal, but of real eloquence, hath giuen a
great grace and beautie to his worke.</HI> Which conceit of S. <HI>Augustine,</HI> deliuered
by him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. l. 1. cont. Marcion. c. 16. p. 357.</NOTE> but in generall termes, is illustrated by <HI>Tertullian;</HI> by the apposition.
of many very notable particular instances, and those very fit and apposite.
Tota operatio <HI>Dei, ex diversitatibus constat; ex Corporalibus, &amp; incorporali|bus;
ex animalibus, &amp; inanimalibus; ex vocalibus &amp; mutis; ex mobilibus
&amp; stativis; ex genitalibus &amp; sterilibus; ex aridis, &amp; humidis: ex calidis &amp;
frigidis; &amp;c. The whole workemanship of God is compounded all of Contra|ries,
of things corporeal, and incorporeall; of things liuing, and without life;
of things loquent, and silent; of things moueable, and vnmoueable; of things
fertile, and sterile; of things dry, and moyst; of things hot, and cold; &amp;c.</HI> And
the same that hee hath shewed, by those instances, in the great world, he
proceedeth to declare, in <HI>Man</HI> also, the little world. <HI>Sic, &amp; Hominem ipsum
diversitas temperavit, tam in corpore, qu&agrave;m insensu. Alia membra fortia,
alia infirma; alia honesta, alia inhonesta; alia gemina, alia vnica; alia compa|ria,
alia disparia. Perind&egrave;, &amp; in sensu: nunc laetitia, nunc anxietas; nunc a|mor,
nunc odium; nunc ira, nunc lenitas. In like case, Man himselfe is made by God
of meerely Contraries: and that not only in his body, but also in his soule too. Some
parts of Man be strong, &amp; some againe be weake; some comely, some homely;
some double, some single; some aequall, some vnaequall. And so likewise in his mind
there is sometimes mirth, and sometimes greife; sometimes loue, and sometimes
hate; sometimes feircenes, and sometimes mildnesse.</HI> So that, the whole world
is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 33. 3.</NOTE> in effect, nothing else but only a massie Coagmentation of <HI>Contraries.</HI> As
<HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI> also directly obserueth. <HI>Euill is against good, &amp; death against life;
the Godly against the sinner,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 33. 14</NOTE> <HI>&amp; the vniust against the faithfull. And so, in all the
workes of the most High, thou mayst see, that there be euer Two: and the one
of them, is against the other.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is this, the onely Obseruation of religious Christians; but also,
of the irreligious <HI>Heathen.</HI> Wherein, many of the most learned haue ex|actly
concurred, affirming, that God (like a skilfull Painter to shew the
grace of his worke the better, hath composed the whole world of
opposite parts; as it were, of <HI>Lights</HI> and <HI>shadowes.</HI> Which as <HI>Trismegistus</HI>
<PB N="333" REF="173">
noteth, is a matter, of so pure and absolute necessity, that, without it, the
world could haue had no beautie. For, if <HI>Contraries</HI> had not bene thus ming|led
together, the curious workes of <HI>Nature</HI> could not haue beene distingui|shed
one of them from another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. Pi|mand. Dial. 10. p, 424.</NOTE> And therefore he pronounceth, that, <HI>Ex op|positione
&amp; contrarietate constare omnia, necesse est: ne&abque; alitor se habere, possi|bile
est.</HI> For, as in a Picture, if all were blacke, or all white, there could be no
grace or beauty in the worke: so in all the workes of <HI>Nature,</HI> if all were good,
or all bad, there could be no grace or sweetnesse in any of them, because no
distinction.</P>
<P>And therefore <HI>Pythagoras</HI> (as <HI>Varro</HI> obserueth) maintained this opinion:
<HI>Omnium rerum initia esse bina:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Varro l. 4. de lingua. Lat. p, 5.</NOTE> <HI>vt, sinitum, &amp; infinitum; bonum, &amp; malum;
vitam, &amp; mortem; diem, &amp; noctem. That the first Principles of all things in
all kindes, are two contraries: as Finite, and Infinite; Good, and Euill; Life,
and Death;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist, l. 1. Meta|phys. cap. 5. To. 2. p, 1376.</NOTE> <HI>Day, and Night;</HI> and such like. Whose opinion, is by <HI>Aristotle</HI>
expressed more fully: who setteth downe distinctly, ten seuerall combinati|ons
of Contraries, which the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> defended, <HI>to be the first Principles
and Originals of all things:</HI> As namely these following. <HI>Finitum, &amp; infini|tum;
Par, &amp; Impar; Vnum, &amp; Plura; Dextrum, &amp; Sinistrum; Masculinum,
&amp; Foemininum; Quiescens, &amp; Motum; Rectum, &amp; Curvum; Lumen, &amp; Tene|bras;
Bonum, &amp; Malum; Quadratum, &amp; Longum;</HI> that is, <HI>Finite, and Infi|nite
Euen, and Odde; One, and Moe; Right hand, and Left; Male, and Female;
Resting, and Mouing; Straight, and Crooked; Light, and Darkenesse; Good, and
Euill; Square, and Long.</HI> These Contraries, they not onely held to be in the
world; but also, to bee the working Principles of all things in the world.
And therefore their Effects must needes be contrary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. ibid.</NOTE> as well as their Causes.
In which opinion, <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">meon</HI> conspired so fully with them; that <HI>Aristotle</HI>
doubteth, whether hee borrowed his opinion from them, or they theirs from
him. Yea, and in another place hee confesseth, that it is the common opini|on
of all the <HI>Philosophers: That the first Principles of all thing must needes
be meere Contraries.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. Phys. c. 5. To. 1. p, 419.</NOTE> <HI>Omnes, Contraria Principia faciunt.</HI> But hee himselfe
handleth this point more exactly, then any, &amp; brings it home more properly
vnto our present purpose. That, in this mixing of <HI>Contraries,</HI> in all sorts of
Creatures, <HI>Nature</HI> delighteth her selfe pleasantly, as with a most sweete <HI>Har|mony:
Natura,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. de Mundo. To. 2. p, 1564.</NOTE> <HI>ad contraria, miro fertur desiderio; at&abque; concentum ex his facit.
Nature is strangely carried with a strong desire, of ioyning contrary things to|gether;
and yet maketh of them a delightfull and most melodious tune.</HI> And
this hee illustrates in that place, by very pregnant instances, both in <HI>Ciuill,</HI> and
<HI>Artificiall,</HI> and <HI>Naturall</HI> things. For <HI>Ciuill</HI> things; he giueth these instan|ces:
<HI>That euery City, though neuer so well composed, and in neuer so great con|cord;
yet consisteth of persons of contrary conditions; some poore, some rich;
some yong, some old; some weake, some strong, some good, some bad. All which,
though they be many, yet make they but one City: and though, in nature, they bee
vnlike;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p, 1564.</NOTE> <HI>yet make they a sweete concord, in the Ciuill State.</HI> In Artificiall things
hee obserueth, that, <HI>Ars, adimitationem Naturae, se componens, idem praestat.
That Art, as it imitateth Nature, in many other things; so doth it also in this,
that it maketh all her workes of a mixture of contraries.</HI> Whereof hee gi|ueth
these instances: <HI>The Art of Painting mixeth contrary colours in her
<PB N="334" REF="174">
Pictures: as blacke, with white; and red, with yellow. The Art of Musicke
mixeth contrary sounds in her Songes: as Sharps, with flats; and briefes, with
Longs. And the Art of Grammar mixeth contrary letters in her words: as vo|wells
with mutes:</HI> and such like. In Naturall things, hee giueth these instan|ces,
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p, 1565.</NOTE> <HI>Vis quaedam, per omnia dimanans, &amp; transiens, siccitatem humori, ca|lorem
frigori, leue gravi commistum, &amp; rotundo rectum; Terram omnem,
Mare, Aethera, Solem, Lunam, &amp; Vniversum exornavit Coelum cum Mun|dum
frabricata esset, ex diversis, &amp; nullo modo immistilibus, aere, terra, igne,
aqua, &amp; imagine vna, quae globos comprehendit. There is a certaine power,
which pierceth, and disperseth it selfe, through the whole world, ioyning dry
things, with moyst, and hot things, with cold; light things, with heauy; and
crooked, with straite: and yet, by this contrary composition, very excellently
beautifying, both the earth, and sea, and skie, and Sun, and Moone, and general|ly
all the heauen: making the frame of this world, of things of far vnlike na|ture,
and such as refuse to be mingled together; ayre, and earth, and fire, and
water; and Heauen, which comprehendeth all these Spheres, in his figure.</HI> Now
all this commixtion of things, so contrary, do not tend to the defacing, but
adorning of the world; as <HI>Concords,</HI> and <HI>Discords</HI> doe, vnto the better tem|pering
of the Harmony in <HI>Singing.</HI> For, by that very Comparison, doth
<HI>Aristotle</HI> expresse them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p, 1565.</NOTE> <HI>Natura &amp; Coelt, &amp; terrae, vniversi&abque; mundi concreti|onem,
principiorum maxim&egrave; contrariorum, vno exornavit, &amp; instruxit concen|tu.
Nature hath compounded, both heauen, and earth, and all the whole World,
of contrary Principles, to adorne it more beautifully, with a concent-full Har|mony.</HI>
Thus (as <HI>Seneca</HI> obserueth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. Epist. 108. p, 269.</NOTE> ioyning instances of all the fore-named
heads together) <HI>Nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ilo, serena succedunt; turbantur maria, c&ugrave;m quieverunt;
noctem, Dies sequitur; pars coeli consurgit, pars mergitur. Contrarijs, rerum
aeternitas constat. After a storme, there comes a calme; the Seas bee troubled,
after they haue rested; after the night, there appeareth day; One part of the
Heauen riseth vp, another goeth downe: The whole frame of the Vniuerse, is
compounded of Contraries.</HI></P>
<P>And thus (as <HI>Trismegistus</HI> obserueth) <HI>Rerum singularum ordo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. Asclep. c. 6. p, 495.</NOTE> <HI>concentum
quendam, melo divino dulcisonum, conficit. The very naturall order of things,
produceth a pleasant Harmony, composed in a kind of diuine and Heauenly me|lody.</HI>
Aud therefore hee affirmeth, that, <HI>Musicam nosse, nihil aliud est, qu&agrave;m
cunctarum rerum ordinem scire: To know Musicke, is nothing else, but to know
the naturall order of things.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Max. Tyr. Serm. 27. p, 319.</NOTE> For, as <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> affirmeth, <HI>Natura, est
perfectissima Harmonia. There is no Harmony better, then the order of
Nature.</HI> Thus God hath made an <HI>Harmony,</HI> in all his Creatures: by the
ioynt obseruation, both of <HI>Christians,</HI> and <HI>Heathens.</HI></P>
<P>2 But, the testimonie of neither of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Creatures are naturally delighted with Musicke.</NOTE> no, nor of them both toge|ther,
doth so euidence the matter, as the things themselues doe; by that
incredible delight, which all of them doe naturally take, in the sweetnesse
of <HI>Musick.</HI> For, there is nothing whatsoeuer, indued with a liuing and a
sensible spirit, but it is rauished, in a sorte, and caried out of itself, with
the bewitching sounds of <HI>Musicke.</HI> I omitt the fabulous narration of <HI>Am|phion:</HI>
as a <HI>Po&euml;tical</HI> fiction: that the power of his <HI>Musick</HI> was so great, that
he could,
<Q><L><PB N="335" REF="174">
Saxa movere sono testudinis;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horat. l. de Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e Pocl. p. 174. B.</NOTE> &amp;, prece blanda,</L>
<L>Ducere qu&ograve; vellet.&mdash;</L>
<L>With Lutes alluring sound, and his sweet tunes, he could</L>
<L>Moue the hard Stones, and make them stirre where 're he would.</L></Q>
Which, though it be but an <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> and <HI>Excesse of speech;</HI> yet the <HI>Poet</HI>
made choise of it, of set purpose, thereby to expresse, with a greater <HI>Empha|sis,</HI>
the incredible power of Musick, vnto vs. Which, indeed, is very great
yea, and not onely with vs men; but also with euery other liuing thing:
both with <HI>Birds,</HI> and with <HI>Beasts,</HI> and with <HI>Fishes;</HI> yea, and euen with very
<HI>Wormes.</HI> As wee may see, in all of them, if wee will but looke vpon
them.</P>
<P>First, for <HI>Birds:</HI> there is no man, but may obserue, by his daily experi|ence,
with what a singular delight, they vse to solace, and entertaine them|selues,
with their naturall Musick; chaunting-out their sweete melodie, vp|on
the pleasant branches of euery greene tree. A thing expresly noted by
the holy Prophet <HI>Dauid:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 104. 12. 24.</NOTE> and by him there ascribed, to be the worke of
God. Neither are they onely delighted with their owne naturall Musick;
but also with Mans artificiall Musick. As we may euidently see, in <HI>Thrushes
Linnets,</HI> and <HI>Blackbirds,</HI> and such like, with what attention they will listen,
vnto the pleasant sounds of Musicall Instruments: yea, and how perfectly
they will learne the tunes of those Songs, that be whistled vnto them.
Which artificiall notes, they could neuer possibly either learne so quickly,
or render so exactly, but that the seeds of true Harmonie, be sowne in their
soules, as well as in mens. Yea, and their delight in Musick is so great,
that they often-times forget their very safetie it selfe, in comparison of it.
As it is noted, by the Poet:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cato. l. 1. p.</NOTE>
<Q><L>Pistula dulce canit, volucrem d&ugrave;m decipit auceps.</L>
<L>The Sweetnesse of the Fowlers pipe,</L>
<L>Deceives the Fowle, with his delight.</L></Q>
Yea, euen Bees, when they swarme, and are vpon the wing, ready to take
their flight, whither either the winde driueth them, or their Captaine leadeth
them: yet, by the sounds of tinckling brasse, are setled againe, and retar|ded
from their course: held onely, by that delight, which they naturally take
in it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. l. 11. c. 20. Aelian. l. 5. de. Animalae. 13.</NOTE> as <HI>Plinie</HI> obserueth. <HI>Gaudent plausu, at&abque; tinnitu aeris, e&oacute;&abque; convocan|tur:
Because they are delighted with that tune and tinckling, they are therewith
called together.</HI> Yea and <HI>Aelianus</HI> likewise saith, <HI>Crepitaculis sonoris, tan|qu&agrave;m
Syrenibus, retrahuntur: They are recalled, and as it were charmed, with
those shrill sounds.</HI></P>
<P>Now likewise for <HI>Beasts:</HI> though their spirits be more dull, and their sen|ses
not so subtile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian l. 7. De Animal. c. 23.</NOTE> as is the sense of <HI>Byrds;</HI> yet haue they no lesse a sense of
Musick. For tame Beasts: <HI>Aelian</HI> giueth instance in the <HI>Arabian Sheepe; that
they grow fat, much more by their Musick, then they doe by their Meat.</HI> And
againe in <HI>Elephants;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Idaem. l. 12. c. 41.</NOTE> <HI>that they are allayed from their greatest rage, by the allu|ring
sounds of Musick.</HI> And, of a contrarie effect, doth <HI>Iob</HI> giue instance, in
the <HI>Horse;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 39. 28.</NOTE> who being enraged with the warlicke sounds of Musick, despiseth
both wounds and death: and hearing the Trumpet, hee reioyceth at it, <HI>smel|ling</HI>
the battle afarre off, and saying in a iollitie, <HI>Ha, Ha:</HI> as in that place hee
<PB N="336" REF="175">
expresseth it. And <HI>Aelianus</HI> in another description fitly paralleleth it. Yea, &amp;
yet againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. l. 6. De. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">al. c. 10. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. l. 2. c. 41.</NOTE> of another contrarie passion, in the <HI>Libian Mares; that by the
sounds of a certaine Hymenaean song, they are accended vnto Venerie:</HI> Which
otherwise they decline. And, for <HI>Wilde-Beasts: Horace</HI> giueth an instance, in
<HI>Orpheus;</HI> that, by the power of his inchanting Musick, hee did
<Q><L>&mdash;Lenire Tygrides, rapidos&abque; Leones.</L>
<L>Tame and make gentle Tygres feirce,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE></L>
<L>And soften Lyons furious.</L></Q>
Which, though the <HI>Poet</HI> there apply to an allegoricall interpretation: yet
doth <HI>Aelian</HI> confirme it, by an Historicall narration. For he maketh report
of diuers sorts of VVildBeasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian. l. 18. de Animal. c. 46. p, 269.</NOTE> that be so farre mollified, with the inticing
sounds of Musick, that they be made by it, forgetfull, both of their young
ones, and themselues. As he proueth, in that place, by the practise of the <HI>Tyr|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">heans:</HI>
who vse to draw Wilde Boores, and Harts, into their Nets, by the one|ly
sweetnesse of certaine Musicall instruments. And <HI>Macrobius</HI> confirmes the
same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. de Som. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">. p. 91.</NOTE> by the like obseruation: who reporteth, that, <HI>Nonnullae, vel aues, vel
terrenae, &amp; aquatiles belluae, invitatae cantu, inretia sponte decurrunt.</HI> He saith
<HI>That there be many,</HI> not onely <HI>Byrds,</HI> and <HI>Beasts</HI> (which were our two former
instances) but also <HI>Fishes</HI> too, (which is our third instance) <HI>that being inticed
with the pleasing sounds of Musick, doe voluntarily rush into the very nets.</HI> As
<HI>Aelian</HI> giueth instance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian. l. 6. de. Animal. c. 30.</NOTE> in those kinde of <HI>Crab-fishes,</HI> which are called
<HI>Paguri:</HI> which will follow the sound of Musick, euen out of the waters: and
so are taken when they come to the land: And againe, in another kinde of
<HI>Fishes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Idem. l. 17. c. 16. Plin. l. 11. c. 37.</NOTE> called <HI>Pastinacae.</HI> And <HI>Plinie</HI> also proueth, by experience, in the <HI>Dol|phins:</HI>
of whom he writeth, that <HI>Et cantu mulcentur, &amp; capiuntur, attoniti sono.
That they are allured by Songs, and taken, whilst they be astonished with their
sounds.</HI> Which delight of theirs in Musick, <HI>Plutarch</HI> affirmeth, to be a <HI>thing
delightfull vnto God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de Sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r|tia Animal. To. 3 p. 90.</NOTE> And he alledgeth to that purpose, certaine verses of

<L>Whom, out a peacefull Sea, the pleasant sound</L>
<L>Of well-tuned Pipe, did force to come aground.</L></Q>
Yea, and how greatly those Fishes be delighted with Musick, we may see by
<HI>Herodotus</HI> his narration of <HI>Arion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodot. l. 1. Item Plut. In Conviv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o. To. 1 p. 373.</NOTE> whom a <HI>Dolphin</HI> (being allured, by the
seewtenesse of his Musick) receiued vpon his backe, and permitted to bestride
him, as it were his horse, bearing him safely to Land, out of the midst of the
Seas. The credit of which report if any man suspect, hee confirmeth the
truth of it, by the assertiue testimonie, both of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and the <HI>Lesbi|ans;</HI>
who searched the truth of it: beside the monument of <HI>Arion</HI> himselfe,
which he offered vnto the <HI>Gods,</HI> for his wonderfull deliuerance: a monument

<P>Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plini. l. 9. c. 8.</NOTE> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> in his History, yeeldeth his assent to this narration of <HI>Arion;</HI>
being thereunto induced by many other instances of <HI>Dolphins,</HI> more stupen|dious.
Which he receiued, by report of persons, of great &amp; vnsuspected credit:
as <HI>Maecenas,</HI> and <HI>Flavianus,</HI> and <HI>Flavius Alfius:</HI> men, as, of great nobility; so
likewise of great grauity, and of vndoubted testimony. Whose wonderfull

singular delight which they take in Musicke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in Conui|uio, 7. Sap. To. 1. p, 377.</NOTE> (affirmed also by <HI>Plutarch</HI>)

authoritie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Item lib: de Solert. Animal. To. 3. p, 90, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>But to come vnto our fourth instance of <HI>Wormes,</HI> and creeping things:
though they bee, but of an vnperfect generation, and of an heauy sense; yet
wee see diuers of them, that practise a naturall kind of Musicke, with no lit|tle
delight. The <HI>Cricket,</HI> by the fire; the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Stobaeus Serm. 29. p, 209.</NOTE> <HI>Grashopper,</HI> in the field; and the

though they bee no better, then meere creakings, and croakings. And thus
Musicall harmony (in all kindes of Creatures) doth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 8. Pol. c, 5. To. 2. p, 902.</NOTE> <HI>Animum abstrahere, &amp;

Creatures, is most euident, in man: who is so naturally delighted with the
<HI>Harmonies</HI> of <HI>Musicke,</HI> that it transporteth his soule, into any affection,
whatsoeuer it will. It comforteth him, in paine. It tempereth him, in plea|sure.

And a contrary effect it had, with <HI>Elizeus;</HI> in whom, the drouping of the

haue all of them also, a naturall instinct, to praise the same God, with their

gaue it. <HI>Proclus</HI> affirmeth of all Gods Creatures, that, <HI>Omnia precantur, Hy|mn&oacute;s&abque;
concinunt, ad ordinis sui ducem: alia, intellectuali modo; alia, rationali;
alia, sensitivo; alia, naturali. All creatures make their prayers, and sings prayses,
to their Ruler: some of them, in a manner, which is meerely intellectual; some of
them, in a reasonable; some of them, in a sensible; and some, only in a natural.</HI> By
<HI>Intellectuall Singers,</HI> he vnderstanding <HI>Angels;</HI> by <HI>Reasonable, Men;</HI> by <HI>Sensi|ble,

Creatures. As it euidently appeareth, euen by his owne instances.
Where, for <HI>Byrds,</HI> hee giueth an example of the <HI>Cock;</HI> whose crowing, hee
interpreteth, to be his saluting of the rising Sun, and his <HI>hymne</HI> vnto <HI>Apollo.</HI>
For plants, he giueth instance in the <HI>Heliotropium:</HI> whose turning continu|ally
towards the Sunne, hee interprets, to be his seruice vnto him: setting
downe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bartas. Day. 5. p. 175.</NOTE> in the same place, a notable <HI>hymne,</HI> wherein he imagineth it to invo|cate
and praise him. As, our noble <HI>Poet Bartas,</HI> doth the like of the <HI>Larke,</HI>
in a notable fiction: whose singing so constantly, in the morning, and eue|ning,
he construeth to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. l. 8. c. 1.</NOTE> her <HI>Morning</HI> and <HI>Euening Song,</HI> and her dayly sa|crifice
in her Creators praise. And, for <HI>Beasts, Plinie</HI> giueth instance, in the
<HI>Elephants;</HI> that they haue not onely a sense of Religion, but also vse a kinde
of Ceremonie in their practise of the same. Yea, and <HI>Aelian</HI> affirmeth of them
(as <HI>Proclus</HI> before did, of the Cock) that they doe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian. l. 7. de Animal. c. 39.</NOTE> <HI>Exorientem Solem vene|rari;

Concluding there his Chapter, with this notable increpation of <HI>Atheists,</HI> and
such like vngodly men: <HI>Ergon&egrave; Deum Elephanti venerantur? Homines au|tem,

He vseth not, in the former, any such Poetical Figure: but simply and plain|ly,

<P>4 Now, for <HI>Man:</HI> hee hath not onely a naturall delight in Musicke, <HI>as</HI>
other Creatures haue; and a naturall abilitie, to expresse all the parts of it,
<HI>more</HI> then other Creatures haue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 40. 21.</NOTE> by the sweetenesse of his tuneable and
melodious voice, farre excelling the sweetenesse of all musicall instruments:

hath laboured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 4. 21.</NOTE> and taken great paines, from the very beginning: yet could
he neuer haue brought it vnto any perfection, if God himselfe had not been
a Scholemaister vnto him. And this is acknowledged, euen of the very Hea|then:
who haue expresly affirmed, that Musick is not the Inuention of <HI>Man,</HI>
but the very gift of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. de. Mu|sica. To. p. 688.</NOTE> <HI>Plutarch</HI> affirmeth directly: <HI>Non Hominem aliquem
repertorem fuisse Musicae, sed omnibus virtutibus ornatum Deum Apollinem:
That no man was the first inventer of Musick, but Apollo their great and ho|nourable
God.</HI> Yea, and, in the same place, hee addeth, that <HI>Musick ought to
be honoured; because it is the invention of a God. Veneranda prorsus est Musica;
Deorum inventum c&ugrave;m sit.</HI> In which his opinion, he was not alone, but had
diuers others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. ibid. p. 694.</NOTE> of the chiefest Philosophers concurring with him. <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith
of <HI>Harmonie:</HI> that it is, <HI>Res Coelestis; eius&abque; natura, &amp; divina, &amp; pulchra:
That Musicke is an heauenly thing, and of a nature, not onely pleasing, but
also diuine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Theophrastus</HI> setteth downe, three originall Causes: whereby Musicke
was first begotten in the mind of a Man;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. in Sympos. l. 1 Quaest. 5. To. 3. p. 168.</NOTE> <HI>Dolorem, voluptatem, &amp; instinctum
divinum: The allaying of his griefe, the procuring of his pleasure, and the in|spiration

to be the chiefest of the rest. Yea and <HI>Plato</HI> affirmeth, without all circuition,

<P>But <HI>Macrobius</HI> handleth this point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 2. de Som. Scip. c. 3. p. 90.</NOTE> a great deale more prolixely, then any
of the rest doe: prouing, by many Arguments, that <HI>Musicke,</HI> was not first in|uented
<PB N="341" REF="178">
vpon earth, but descended downe from Heauen. Yea, and that, in
the opinion of the very Heathen, deliuered expresly in their mystical <HI>Theo|logy.</HI>
His Reasons bee these following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hesiod. in Theo|gon. p, 80.</NOTE> First, that <HI>Hesiodus;</HI> who writeth the
generation of their Gods, recording exactly, from whence they first sprang,
calleth one of their <HI>Muses, Vrania;</HI> which signifieth, <HI>Heauenly.</HI> Insinuating
thereby, that there is <HI>Musicke</HI> in Heauen: and, that from heauen it first was
brought, by the <HI>Muses,</HI> vnto men. In whom also wee may obserue, that hee
maketh <HI>Harmonia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid, p, 128.</NOTE> to haue bene the Daughter of <HI>Mars,</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> two of
the Heathen Gods: thereby againe implying, that <HI>Harmony</HI> was first begot|ten
in Heauen. Another of his Reasons is, that <HI>Hesiodus</HI> calleth another of
the <HI>Muses,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">: her name being giuen, for <HI>the sweetensse of her voice;</HI> as
<HI>Vrania's</HI> was, from <HI>the highnesse of the place.</HI> Thereby againe implying; that
<HI>The sweetenesse of voice, hath the highest place in Heauen.</HI> Another: that
the Heathen called <HI>Apollo,</HI> who was one of their greatest gods, <GAP DESC="foreign">: <HI>quasi
Ducem, &amp; Principem Musarum: The Prince, and Ruler of the Muses.</HI> Ano|ther:
that, euen their very <HI>Rusticks,</HI> called the <HI>Muses, Camoenas, quasi Cane|nas;
Acanendo dictas,</HI> that is, <HI>Singing Damosels.</HI> Now, the <HI>Muses</HI> (as they
all confesse) descended first from Heauen. Another: that, in all their fune|rall
pompes, and solemne exequies, they still carried-out their dead, with mu|sicall
instruments:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 9. 23.</NOTE> which was likewise in practice, euen among the <HI>Iewes.</HI> And
this, he saith, they did, to signifie that their soules were now departed, vnto
the originall house of <HI>Musicke: Ad originem dulcedinis Musicae, idest, ad
Coelum:</HI> in their owne interpretation. And this, againe hee saith, is the true
Cause, why euery mans soule is so much delighted with <HI>Musicke</HI> vpon earth:
<HI>Quia in Corpus defert memoriam Musicae, ciuius in Coelo fuit conscia: Because
it bringeth downe with it, into the Body, a remembrance of that Musicke,
whereof, in Heauen, it had a full fruition.</HI> These, and diuers such like Argu|ments
hee congesteth, in that place, to proue, that <HI>Musicke</HI> descended first
from Heauen. Of which, though some bee not greatly strong; yet they
strongly shew, that, euen the Heathen held this, as a sacred opinion, that <HI>Mu|sicke
is Gods gift, and not mans inuention.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and that which the Heathen haue so ingenuously acknowledged, of
the whole body of <HI>Musicke;</HI> they likewise acknowledge, of both the kindes
of it; both of <HI>Vocal,</HI> and <HI>Organical.</HI> For <HI>Vocal Musicke. Homer</HI> expresly
affirmeth of the Singer <HI>Demodocus,</HI> (the most excellent in those times) that
the Sweetnesse of his voyce, whereby hee so greatly delighted all men, was a
speciall gift, which God had giuen vnto him:
<Q><L>&mdash;divinum Cantorem</L>
<L>Demodocum:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homer, l. 8 Odys. p, 202.</NOTE> huic quidem Deus excellenter dedit cantilenam</L>
<L>Ad oblectandum, quocun&abque; animus ipsum impulerit canere.</L>
<L>A most diuine, and heauenly Songster, Demodocus was:</L>
<L>Who did, in most delightfull layes, all other men surpasse.</L>
<L>What ere his mind did leade him to, he did excell in singing:</L>
<L>And all this excellency of his, was giuen by God vnto him.</L></Q>
And, that, which hee affirmeth particularly of him, doth <HI>Seneca</HI> affirme, in
generall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. l. 4. de Benefic. c. 6. p, 50.</NOTE> of all men. <HI>Ille, Deus est, qui non calamo tant&ugrave;m cantare, at&abque; agreste
&amp; inconditum carmen, ad aliquam tant&ugrave;m oblectationem, modulari docuit: sed
<PB N="342" REF="179">
tot Artes, tot vocum varietates, tot sonos, alios, spiritu nostro; alios, externo,
cantus edituros, commentus est. It is God that hath taught men, not onely to
play, vpon rude and homely pipes, fit for rude and Country song's; but that
first hath invented all those Arts, all those varieties of voices, and all those
sounds, whereby, either with our owne breath, or with others, we expresse all
those songs.</HI> And therefore the <HI>Psalmist</HI> concludeth the booke of Psalmes,
with this <HI>Epiphonema:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 1506.</NOTE> <HI>Let euery thing that hath breath, praise the Lord.</HI> That
so God, who gaue those instruments vnto men, might, with his owne gift, be
praised by them.</P>
<P>For so is <HI>Organicall Musicke,</HI> as well as <HI>Vocal:</HI> it also is Gods gift. Yea, and
that also by the Confession, euen of the very Heathen. For so, <HI>Homer</HI> affir|meth
in expresse and plaine words:

<L>God giu's to one, the feates of Armes; t' another, art of dansing;</L>
<L>He giu's another, skill to harpe; another, voice for singing.</L></Q>
So that, both playing and Singing he acknowledgeth, to be the gifts of God,
vnto men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Max. Tyr. Serm. 22. p. 264.</NOTE> Yea, and <HI>Maeximus Tyrius</HI> reproueth the <HI>Musition Demodocus,</HI>
whom before I named; because he ascribed not vnto God, his gift in play|ng,
as well as in singing: <HI>Ne&abque; fide dignus Demodocus, c&ugrave;m de seipso dicit:</HI>
<Q>Ipse mihi Doctor: tribuerunt Numina vocem.</Q>
<HI>Demodocus is not to be beleeued, when he vaunteth of himselfe; That the Gods

<P>Neither did the Heathen, onely ascribe vnto God, to bee the giuer of the

Thus, not onely <HI>Musicke</HI> it selfe, of all kindes; but also all Musicall instru|ments,
of all sorts, are (euen in the iudgment of the very Heathen) confessed
to bee the gifts of God vnto Men. Which, though they bee made by
the hand of man; yet were they directed by the wisdome of God. And
therefore the Heathen haue iustly ascribed them, not vnto him that
<PB N="343" REF="179">
wrought them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chiefest&punc; end of Musick is to praise God with it.</NOTE> but vnto him that taught them.</P>
<P>5 Now, as God hath giuen vnto man, a natural kind of <HI>Musick,</HI> wherewith
his soule is delighted; so hath hee also giuen him a naturall sense, and instinct
to worship God with it, as a tribute, due to him, from whom it was first gi|uen.
As may be euidently seene, by the generall practice both of <HI>Christians,</HI> &amp;
<HI>Heathens.</HI> Who, as they doe agree by the light of <HI>Nature,</HI> in worshipping of
God; so doe they likewise agree, by the same light of Nature, to vse Musicke
in his worship. For the practice of <HI>Christians:</HI> the whole Booke of Psalmes
is an euidence of it. Which, as it was dayly sung in the old Church of the
<HI>Iewes;</HI> so is it still dayly sung in all the Churches of <HI>Christians,</HI> through the
whole world of <HI>Christianitie.</HI> In which Booke (being penned by the <HI>Holy
Ghost</HI>) we may obserue, three remarkeable things. First, that, as God hath
appointed vnto man, a <HI>Sabbath day,</HI> wherein to praise and serue him: so hath
hee also appointed them to serue him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16.</NOTE> with <HI>hymnes, and psalmes, and spiritu|all
songs.</HI> Yea, and, among them, hath selected certaine speciall Psalmes,
from among all the rest, as specially appropriated vnto those <HI>Sabbath Dayes:</HI>
As may be euidently seene, by the title and inscription, of the 92. Psalme; <HI>A
Psalme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal 92.</NOTE> or <HI>Song, for the Sabbath Day.</HI> Secondly, that hee hath further had a
speciall care, not onely of the Dittie, but also of the Tune too. As it like|wise
appeareth by the Titles and inscriptions of diuers other Psalmes. <HI>Ma|gistro
Symphoniae ad pneumatica instrumenta.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 4. 5. 6. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Magistro Symphoniae fidium ad
grauem symphoniam. Magistro Symphoniae acutae ad medianam:</HI> and diuers
others such like. Thirdly, that, not contented with the Musick of mens na|turall
voices, he hath further added to them (for the quickning of deuotion)
the helpe of all sorts of Musicall instruments.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 150. 3. 4. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Praise him, in the sound of the
Trumpet. Praise him, vpon the Lute, and Harpe. Praise him, with Timbrels, and
Flute, with Virginals, and Organs, and with high sounding Cymbals.</HI> Thus,
God himselfe hath required, to haue his Seruice furnished, with all the seue|rall
sorts of <HI>Musick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. l. 2. de Doct. Christ. To. 3. c. 17 Isidor. l. 2. Orig. c. 18.</NOTE> both <HI>Harmonical, Rithmicall,</HI> and <HI>Organicall.</HI> And there|fore
<HI>Boetius</HI> ascribeth vnto the Art of <HI>Musick,</HI> a principa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l honor, aboue all the
other. <HI>Inter septem Artes Liberales, principatum oblinet Musica.</HI> And <HI>Beda,</HI>
who reporteth his opinion, alledgeth for it a good Reason:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beda, lib. de Musica Practia. Tom 1. p. 417.</NOTE> Because it, of all
other Arts, hath onely the honour to enter into the Church; and there to
be vsed, in Gods owne immeditate seruice. For, this is an Arte so Heauenly
and diuine, that it seemeth to haue beene giuen by God, vnto men, to this
speciall ende; that by it Men might set out the glorie of God. And therefore
<HI>Plutarch</HI> affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. lib. de Mu|sica To. 2. p. 707.</NOTE> that, <HI>Primum, &amp; pulcherrimum Musicae officium, est, grata
aduers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m Deos remuneratio: The first, and the fayrest office of Musick, is the
returne of our thankfulnesse vnto God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 116, 12, 13</NOTE> <HI>for his goodnesse.</HI> VVhich office the
Prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> accordingly put in practice. <HI>What can I returne vnto the Lord
for all his benefits? I will take vnto me, the Cup of saluation, and will call vp|on
the Name of the Lord.</HI> Here is the best returne, that by man can be made
to sacrifice the true thankfulnesse of his soule vnto God; as for all his other
inestimable Benefits, so for this among the rest, for giuing vs so Musicall and
tuneable a voice, whereby wee haue a meane to praise him for all the rest.
<HI>Pium est enim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. vb&igrave; supr&agrave;. p. 681.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; praecipuum hominum hoc studium</HI> (saith <HI>Plutarch</HI> againe)
<HI>Laudes canere Deorum, qui soli ipsis articulatam vocem sunt largiti. It is a
<PB N="344" REF="180">
pious and a principall duty of man, to sing prayses vnto God; who onely hath gi|uen
him that articulate voyce, whereby he is able to sing vnto him.</HI> Thus this
learned <HI>Philosopher,</HI> both deriueth the Arte of Musick from God, as from his
originall beginning; and referreth it vnto God, as to his principall ende.</P>
<P>And this was not his opinion alone, but the very Religion, of all the rest of
the Heathen. As may be euidently seene, not onely in <HI>Hesiodus,</HI> but also in
<HI>Trismegistus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hesiod in Theo|gon. p 78.</NOTE> two of their cheife <HI>Divines.</HI> For the first of them: <HI>Hesiodus,</HI>
he maketh the Muses (who were the Authors of Musick) the Daughters of
<HI>Iupiter:</HI> and therefore, to drawe their originall from God. And he maketh
them againe, to sing alwayes before him: and therefore to referre all their
Musick vnto God. And <HI>Trismegistus</HI> likewise, expresly deliuereth, both the
very same points.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg. in Asclap. c. 5. p. 490.</NOTE> For the first of them: he saith that, <HI>Musarum chorus, est a
summa Divinitate demissus, ne terrenus mundus videretur incultior, si modulo|rum
dulcedine caruisset: That the Quire of the Muses, was sent downe from
heauen, from the highest of the Gods; lest this terrene and inferiour world
should be barbarous and rude, if it lacked the delight and sweetenesse of Mu|sick.</HI>
And, for the second of them, he addeth: <HI>Sed poti&ugrave;s, vt modulatis ho|minum
cantilenis concelebretur laudibus, qui solus dat omnia; vt Pater est
omnium. But yet the higher ende of musick was, that, by mens delightfull mu|sicke,
hee might be onely praysed, who is the Giuer of all; as being indeed the
very Father of all.</HI> So then Musick was first giuen by God to Men; that
Men might, by it, giue due praises vnto God. For the true vse of Musicke
(as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> obserueth) is principally this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Athenaeus. l. 14. p. 471.</NOTE> <HI>Deorum laudes Musicis Canticis
personare: To chante out Gods prayses with musical Songs.</HI> And therefore
the ancient Musick (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> recordeth) <HI>was only vsed in the Temples, for
the worship of God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. vbi. sup. p. 697.</NOTE> <HI>and not in Theaters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. l. 2. de Som. Scip. c. 3. p. 90.</NOTE> for the vaine delight of men.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. vbi. sup. p. 689.</NOTE> For
the Custome of the Heathens (as <HI>Macrobius</HI> reporteth, and <HI>Plutarch</HI> by ma|ny
speciall instances confirmeth) was, to <HI>vse Musick</HI> and <HI>Songs,</HI> in all their
publicke prayers. Yea, and <HI>Plato</HI> well approueth it: <HI>Rectissimum erit, vt Hym|ni
laud&eacute;s&abque; Deorum, precibus mixtae, canantur.</HI> Hee would alwayes haue
<HI>Hymnes,</HI> intermixed with prayers, and especially, with their solmne sacrifices.
Whence, <HI>Maximus Tyrius,</HI> calleth Musicke, <HI>Optimum in Sacrificijs comitem:
A sweete companion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Max. Tyr. Serm. 21. p. 257.</NOTE> <HI>in all their sacrificing.</HI> Yea, and there addeth further,

their holy mysteries.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 8. Pol. c. 7 To. 2. p. 905.</NOTE> Which opinion of his, <HI>Aristotle</HI> also confirmeth; who
affirmeth of Musick, that it hath a power in it, <HI>both purgatiue, and sanatiue:</HI>
whereby a mans minde is made both pure, and humble, and deuout. And
therefore we may obserue, in the practice of <HI>Heathens,</HI> as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">of <HI>Christians;</HI>
that they haue not thought it sufficient, to worship God onely with prayers
&amp; invocations, but also with <HI>Hymnes,</HI> and <HI>Odes. Aelian</HI> recordeth an <HI>Hymne</HI> of
thankesgiuing which <HI>Arion</HI> made to <HI>Neptune,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian. l. 12. De Animal. c. 42. p. 268.</NOTE> for his deliuerance by the

vpon the like contemplations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trismeg.</NOTE> setteth downe diuers <HI>Hymnes,</HI> which he made
in Gods praise. Yea, and <HI>Homer</HI> hath made a set Booke of <HI>Hymnes,</HI> wherein
he setteth out the prayses of all their Gods. Which kinde of <HI>Hymnes,</HI>
<PB N="345" REF="180">
(as <HI>Macrobius</HI> recordeth) were vsually sung,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrob. vbi supr&agrave;.</NOTE> in the Temples of the <HI>Heathen,

by <HI>Verses,</HI> and <HI>Antiphonies,</HI> answering one another: And the like wee
may obserue, to haue beene also in vse, in the Church of the <HI>Iewes.</HI>
As appeareth in all the <HI>Psalmes;</HI> from the 146. vnto the end of the <HI>Psalme-Booke.</HI>
Where, as euery Psalme beginneth with an <HI>Allelu-iah,</HI> or, <HI>Praise
the Lord,</HI> by <HI>Stropha:</HI> so doth it likewise end, with an <HI>Allelu-iah,</HI> or, <HI>Praise the
Lord,</HI> by <HI>Antistropha.</HI> And the same order of singing is obserued, euen in

the <GAP DESC="foreign">; who beareth also his part, in this Diuine and Heauenly <HI>Har|monie.</HI>
As euidently appeareth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. 19. 1.</NOTE> in the Booke of the <HI>Apocalyps.</HI> Where, a
Multitude of <HI>Saints,</HI> singing vnto Gods praise, and beginning their <HI>Allelu-iah,</HI>
by way of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ropha,</HI> they were answered againe, by the <HI>Elders,</HI> and <HI>foure

<HI>they both</HI> were answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. 5. 6: 7.</NOTE> with <HI>a voic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the Throne,</HI> with another <HI>Allelu-iah,</HI>
rebounding, and ecchoing from another place of <HI>Heauen.</HI> And, when
they all had thus sung, their seuerall <HI>Allelu-iah,</HI> by themselues, asunder; then
they ioyned in one, and sung it altogether. Here is an adumbration of the
<HI>Quire</HI> of Heauen: and the forme of the singing of <HI>Saints,</HI> and <HI>Angells</HI> there|in.
Whereby it appeareth, that God hath not onely appointed, that Men
should heere praise him, with holy Harmonies, in this present life; but also,
with Heauenly Harmonies, in the life to come.</P>
<P>And this also was both knowne, and acknowledged, by the very Heathen:
As it euidently appeareth, by the testimony of <HI>Pindarus.</HI>

_THIS second Booke prouing, <HI>That there is a God,</HI> from <HI>the

Scholer, vnto whom these grounds of Arts are common, and familiar. And
therefore, all the rest, which are as yet behind, I will but onely touch, and that
with a light finger, to make the way shorter, vnto other more plausible and
popular matter. Now the residue of the liberal Arts, be these three in number
<HI>Grammer, Logicke,</HI> and <HI>Rhetorick.</HI> Which, all of them, are acknowledged,
euen by the very Heathen, to bee Gods speciall Gifts and Blessings vnto men.</P>
<P>And first, as concerning <HI>Grammer.</HI> That is defined, to bee, <HI>Arts rect&egrave; Lo|quendi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lilly Gramma|tica.</NOTE>
<HI>at&abque; scribendi; An Art of rightly Speaking, and Writing.</HI> So that,
the naturall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grammer sheweth There is a God.</NOTE> and, as it were, the homogeneall parts of <HI>Grammer,</HI> be two, <HI>Or|thology,
and Orthography.</HI> In both which parts of it, God hath had a speciall
hand; as, euen by the Heathen themselues, is acknowledged: in the first of
them, <HI>Orthology;</HI> in teaching men the right imposition of names: in the
second of them, <HI>Orthography;</HI> in teaching them the rare inuention of letters.
Two workes of so diuine and heauenly an inuention, that, without them,
humane life were nothing but confusion.</P>
<P>For the better, and more cleere demonstration whereof, wee are to know
thus much. That the facultie of speaking is not naturall vnto a man, no
more then to a Beast. A man hath no more giuen speech vnto himselfe, then
hee hath giuen himselfe the Tongue, wherewith hee speaketh. But God is
the giuer of them both. And the tongue of a man, would be altogether as
dumbe, as the tongue of a Beast; if God himselfe, at the first, had not taught
it how to speake. Therefore, this gift of speaking, as it was at the first habi|tually
infused into <HI>Adam,</HI> so hath it euer since bene propagated from him, by
onely imitation.</P>
<P>I know, it is an old receiued opinion, that (notwithstanding this great
varietie of seuerall languages, which wee see entertained in diuers nations)
yet that man hath a naturall speech of his owne, as hee is a man: which lan|guage
hee would speake by nature, if hee were not taught some other. But
this is but a dreame: and hath beene twice refuted, by a double experiment.
The first was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herod. l. 2. p.</NOTE> by <HI>Psammeticus,</HI> a King of <HI>Egypt:</HI> who desiring to vnderstand,
which was mans most ancient and naturall language, hee caused two Chil|dren
to bee sequestred from all society of men, and to bee nourished onely
by sucking two shee-goates, forbidding all speech vnto them. VVhich
Children, continuing for a long time dumbe, at last vttered, <HI>Bec, Bec.</HI>
The King being informed, that, in the <HI>Phrygian</HI> Language, <HI>Bec,</HI> signified
<HI>Bread,</HI> imagined that the Children called then for <HI>Bread:</HI> and from thence
collected, that, because they spake that language which no man had taught
them, that therefore the Phrygian language was the naturall speech of man.
A silly proofe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. l. 1. de Placitis, c. 17. To. 2. p. 15.</NOTE> God knoweth. His conceit of <HI>Bec, Bec,</HI> well deseruing to be
numbered with those <HI>Becceselenae,</HI> those doting old tales, which haue euer
<PB N="347" REF="181">
beene contemned of those that are wise. For the Childrens <HI>Bec, Bec,</HI> (as is
probably collected) was onely that language which they learned of their
Goat-nurses, when they came to suck their teates. Who, receiuing of them
some ease by their sucking, saluted them with <HI>Bec,</HI> the best language which
they had. From whom the children learned it. And so much as they heard,
iust so much againe they vttered, &amp; no more. And if they had not heard
it, they could neuer haue pronounced it. As we may euidently see, by an o|ther
experiment tried vpon other Infants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purchas, Pilgrim&punc; lib. 1. c. 8. p, 40.</NOTE> (which is our second instance)
by <HI>Melabdim Echebar,</HI> whom they call <HI>The great Mogor.</HI> He likewise (vpon
the fore-named error) that Man hath a certaine proper language by <HI>Nature,</HI>
caused thirty Children to be brought vp in dumbe silence, to finde out, by
experience, whether all of them would speake one and the same language? ha|uing
inwardly a purpose, to frame his religion, conformable to that nation,
whose language should be spoken: as being that Religion, which is purely
naturall vnto man. But the Children proued all dumbe: though there were
so many of them. And therefore they could not speake because they were
not taught. Whereby it appeareth, that <HI>Speaking,</HI> which is the first part of
<HI>Grammer,</HI> is not in man by Nature. But the first man had it, by onely diuine
infusion; and all his posteritie, onely by imitation.</P>
<P>Now the first element and originall of all speech, is the <HI>Imposition of
Names.</HI> Without which, there can be no distinction of things. I meane,
not, <HI>quoad nos;</HI> though, <HI>quoad naturam,</HI> they be sufficiently distinguished, by
those substantiall properties which are their essentiall and specificall differen|ces.
But yet, they could haue no distinction in <HI>speech,</HI> if they were not diui|ded
by their seuerall names. No, nor in <HI>vse</HI> neither. For, if things were not
separated by their proper names,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke, 11. 11. 12.</NOTE> then <HI>if a man should aske for Bread, they
might giue him a Stone; if for a Fish, a Serpent; if for an Egg, a Scorpion.</HI> And
so in all other things, there would follow like confusion. As we may see, in the
building of the Tower of <HI>Babilon:</HI> how when the Labourers vnderstood not
the names of those things, for which the Builders called, the worke was
brought vnto a stand, and could not goe forward. So that, the right orde|ring
of all humane affaires dependeth chiefely vpon the distinction of names,
without which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. l. de Ma|gistro. c. 5. To. 1. Cicero de Fini|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us p. 142. b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> there can be no knowledg of things. For, <HI>Nomen est a noscen|do

of names,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stobaus Serm. 101. p. 556.</NOTE> for one of Gods owne works: holding it, for an invention, aboue

affirmeth of <HI>Logick,</HI> that it is <HI>Deorum munus: A gift and token of God vnto

<HI>Logick,</HI> they confesse likewise of <HI>Rhetoricks:</HI> That it is also a speciall gift of God,
For if Grammer, which is but the Arte of speaking, be so, then must <HI>Rhe|torick,</HI>
which is the Arte of Pleading, much more be so. It is a farre higher
gift, to pleade then to speake. To speake, is euery mans gift; but to plead, the
gift of few. And therefore; as <HI>Plato</HI> collecteth in another like Case; <HI>If God
be the Giuer of the lesser blessings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Epinom 913. p.</NOTE> <HI>then much more of the greater. Ipsum bono|rum
omnium Authorem, cur non maximi etiam boni causam arbitramur?</HI> And
therefore <HI>Dionysius Areopagita</HI> expresly affirmeth, <HI>That both these Arts of
Speaking, are Gods speciall gifts. Deus, &amp; dicendi, &amp; ben&egrave; dicendi munus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dionys. l. de. Di|uin. Nom. c. 13. p. 332.</NOTE>
<HI>concessit. It is God, that hath giuen, hoth the Arte of Speaking, and the Arte of
Well speaking. Tullie,</HI> that great Orator; speaking of the Arte Oratorie, affir|meth
it, not to be a gift of Nature, but to descend from God, as from the
first Author: <HI>Primus eius Artis Antistes esse, Deus putatur. The first Author
of that Arte is beleeued to be God.</HI> And though, in the same place, hee be
driuen to confesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. de. Orat. p. 146.</NOTE> that the benignitie of Nature hath no little sway in it; yet
there he further addeth, that euen, <HI>Idipsum, quod est hominis proprium, non sit
partum per nos; sed divinit&ugrave;s ad nos delatum: That, euen that naturall habilitie,
which any man hath vnto it, is not gotten by himselfe, but is giuen him by God.
It is God that giueth the Tongue of the learned:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 50. 4.</NOTE> as the Prophet <HI>Isay</HI> testifieth.
And therefore the same Orator, in another place, affirmeth; not following
any other mans opinion, but deliuering his owne; <HI>That it is onely God, that is
indeed the Maker of euery good Oration, by his diuine infusion. Mihi quidem
n&egrave; haec notiora,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. Tusc. p. 117.</NOTE> <HI>at&abque; illustriora, carere vi divina videntur: vt Ego, aut Poetam,

make a good Po&euml;m, nor yet any Orator a good Oration, if he be not infused with
a divine inspiration.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pindar. Pythi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|rum Od. 1. p. 187.</NOTE> For, as <HI>Pindarus</HI> also confesseth, vnto the same purpose:
<HI>Et sapientes, &amp; eloquentes, Dei benignitate, fiunt. It is onely Gods blessing, that
giueth vnto men, both eloquence and wisedome. So Origen. Qu&ograve;d verba quis
fecerit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orig. contra Celsum. l. 6. 4. fol. aet. finem.</NOTE> <HI>quae persuadendi vim habeant, id Dei munere fit; quod ver&ograve; suadeaetur,
non semper ex Deo procedit. The power of perswading is alwayes the gift of
<PB N="352" REF="184">
God; though the thing perswaded sometimes be not.</HI> Yea, and God himselfe ex|presly
chalengeth the same to be his gift. Yea the whole Trinitie chalengeth
it, who haue all a true right in it. God the Father, he chalengeth it, vnto the
Prophet <HI>Moses:</HI> who when hee detrected his returne into <HI>Egypt,</HI> vpon pre|tence
of his <HI>stammering,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 4. 10. 11.</NOTE> God himselfe demanded of him: <HI>Who it was that had
giuen the mouth vnto man? Is it not I the Lord?</HI> God the Sonne, hee chalen|geth
it, vnto his <HI>Disciples:</HI> forbidding them to be carefull, when they came
before Magistrates <HI>what answer they should make them;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10. 19. 20.</NOTE> and assuredly promi|sing,
<HI>that, in that very howre, it should be giuen to them.</HI> And the Holy Ghost,
he chalengeth it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 2. 4.</NOTE> assuming vnto himselfe, <HI>that gift of strang speaking,</HI> wherwith
the Apostles amazed all their hearers: <HI>They beganne to speake with other
tongues, as the Spirit gaue them vtterance.</HI> By all which specialties, this Con|clusion
is proued,</P>
<P>4 Thus, all those three Arts, <HI>Grammer, Logick,</HI> and <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> are all of
them giuen vnto men, by God. Yea, and that by God the <HI>Word: who is the wise|dome
of his Father:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1. 24. lo. 1. 9.</NOTE> <HI>and who is the true light, that lighteneth euery man that
commeth into the world.</HI> And this also, by the Confession euen of the very
Heathen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. l. 13. de Praeparat. c. 7. p. 278.</NOTE> For it is <HI>Epicharmus</HI> his <HI>Tenet:</HI> that, <HI>Divinum Verbum omnes
Artes hominibus suggerit: It is onely God the Word, which giueth men the know|ledge
of all Arts and sciences.</HI> Which if it be generally true, in all Arts; then
is it most specially true, in those Arts. For, all those three Arts, doe carie vp|on
them, the very name of that God, who is the Giuer of them. For, as God
the son is called <GAP DESC="foreign">: so likewise is euery one of those forenamed Arts. There
is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Verbum:</HI> and that is <HI>Grammer.</HI> There is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Ratio,</HI> and that is <HI>Logick.</HI>
And there is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Oratio:</HI> and that is <HI>Rhetorick.</HI> So that, as God the Son doth
carrie vpon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1. 3.</NOTE> <HI>the Character of his Father:</HI> so doe those threearts the Cha|racter
of their Author. Euery one of them is <GAP DESC="foreign">, as God the Sonne is. So
that, <GAP DESC="foreign">, in generall, is like the nature of the Deitie, which is common vnto
all the three persons of the <HI>Trinitie:</HI> and so is <GAP DESC="foreign">, vnto all those three arts. So
that as in the <HI>Trinitie</HI> it may truely be sayd; <HI>That the Father, is God; the Sonne
is God; and the Holy Ghost, is God:</HI> So may it be sayd, in the Trinitie of those
arts; <HI>That Grammer, is <GAP DESC="foreign">, Logick, is <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp; Rhetorick, is</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, Here they are
al <HI>conioyned</HI> together as in one common nature. And, as in the <HI>Trinity</HI> it may
againe be sayd; <HI>That the Father, is not the Sonne; nor the Sonne, the Holy Ghost,
nor the Holy Ghost, the Father:</HI> so may it be sayd likewise, in those three arts,
and sciences: <HI>That Grammer,</HI> is not <HI>Logick;</HI> nor <HI>Logick, Rhetorick;</HI> nor <HI>Rheto|rick,
Grammer.</HI> Here againe <HI>disioyned.</HI> And yet, in another respect againe
<HI>conioyned.</HI> For, as in the <HI>Trinitie, the Father doth beget the Sonne, and they two
produce the Holy Ghost:</HI> so, in this other Trinitie, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Ratio,</HI> doth beget <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<HI>Verbum;</HI> and they two produce out of them, an other third <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is <HI>Ora|tio.</HI>
So that those three arts are not onely affirmed to be the gifts of God, by
the testmonie of the Heathen, but they also declare it, by their very name.</P>

doe not philosophize: Mali non philosophantur:</HI> because, euen in their being
euill men, they put on a contrary nature vpon them. For the Nature of <HI>Phi|losophy</HI>
is, <HI>by louing of God, to make men become good.</HI> And, in this nature,
euery man ought to bee a <HI>Philosopher:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iust. Mart. Dial. cum Tryphon. To. 2 p. 30. Arist. l. 1. Ethic. c. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Deum scilicet amando: yea euen the

teacheth a man to loue God, euen by his very name. And therefore it

<P>Againe, <HI>Aristotle</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l 2. Me|taph. c: 2.</NOTE> calleth true <HI>Philosophie, Scientiam veritatis: The know|ledge
of the Truth:</HI> and affirmeth, that <HI>The end of it, is onely Veritas,</HI> that is,
<HI>to attaine vnto the truth.</HI> Now, <HI>God is, prima veritas, God is the first Truth,</HI> as
<HI>Trismegistus</HI> affirmeth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stobae&abus;, Serm. 11. p. 134.</NOTE> <HI>Primam veritatem, aio, Vnum, &amp; solum illum, qui non

onely thing, which hath neither body, nor matter, colour, nor figure, neuer subiect
to alteration, and yet euer in perfect being.</HI> All which attributes, can agree
vnto nothing else, but onely vnto God himselfe. Whom the <HI>Scriptures</HI> like|wise
call,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 14.</NOTE> by the name of the <HI>Truth: I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</HI>
And this is that <HI>Truth,</HI> which we first ought to seeke for; as being the <HI>Way,</HI>
which leadeth vs vnto <HI>Life. This is euerlasting life, to know thee to bee the
onely</HI> true <HI>God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 17.</NOTE> <HI>and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ.</HI> And the knowledge of
<HI>Truth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 1. Rhetor. ad Theodect. c. 1. m.</NOTE> is the very end, for which man was created: as euen <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe
hath expresly affirmed. <HI>Homines ad veritatem nati sunt. Men are borne for
nothing else, but to seeke for the Truth.</HI> So that, whether <HI>Philosophy</HI> bee the
loue of <HI>Wisdome;</HI> as <HI>Pythagoras</HI> intended: or, <HI>the knowledge of the Truth;</HI> as
<HI>Aristotle</HI> intended: yet both wayes it leadeth a man vnto God, <HI>who is both the
highest wisdome, and the chiefest Truth:</HI> Yea, and that, by vertue of the very
name.</P>
<P>Now come wee from the notation of the name, vnto the definition of the
Thing: and wee shall see it there againe. For <HI>Philosophy,</HI> is defined to bee,
<HI>Omnium rerum, divinarum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. de Orat. p. 103. a. Item in lib. de Vniuerso. Senec. Epist. 14.</NOTE> <HI>at&abque; humanarum scientia: The knowledge of all
things, both diuine, and humane.</HI> Whence <HI>Seneca</HI> affirmeth, that, <HI>Nomen Phi|losophiae,
est non sol&ugrave;m venerabile, sed etiam sacrum. The very name of Phi|losophie,
is both honourable, and holy: Honorable, in things humane; and Holy,
in things Diuine.</HI> Now, if <HI>Philosophie</HI> teach vs the knowledge <HI>of the things
of God;</HI> then must it needes leade vs, to the knowledge of God himselfe.
And so indeede, true <HI>Philosophy</HI> doth. For, there is none other way to come
vnto God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme 37. 27.</NOTE> but by <HI>eschewing of Euill, and doing of Good.</HI> And both these
lessons doth <HI>Philosophy</HI> teach vs. For it is, both <HI>Expultrix vitiorum;</HI> and
<HI>Indagatrix virtutum: The Expeller of vices; and Searcher-out of vertues.</HI>
<PB N="355" REF="185">
First, it expelleth vices, as skilfull Phisitions doe peccant and vicious humors.
And therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Tusc. 228. b. 191. a. 177 a.</NOTE> in another place, he calleth <HI>Philosophie, Medicinam Animi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
The Phisick of the Soule:</HI> and in another, <HI>Culturam Animi: The Husbandrie
and manuring of the Soule:</HI> which rooteth out all vices, as noysome and hurt|full
weeds. So that, for the first part of the way vnto God; which is <HI>Flying
of euill; Philosophie,</HI> not onely pointes it out vnto vs, but also, in a sort, doth
leade vs in it by the hand. Whereupon, in the fore-alledged place, hee cal|leth
<HI>Philosophie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Tusc. 228. b. Cic. de Fin. 90. b. Cic. in Pison. 95. a.</NOTE> <HI>The Guide of our life: Ducem vitae.</HI> And, for the second
part of the way; which is <HI>Doing of Good;</HI> he calleth <HI>Philosophie, Artem vitae:
The Arte of mans life.</HI> Which Arte contayneth in it (as in another place he
noteth) <HI>Et virtutis, &amp; officij, &amp; ben&egrave; vivendi disciplinam: A full and perfect
instruction both in all vertues, and in all manner of well liuing.</HI> Neither doth
it onely teach the <HI>knowledge</HI> thereof vnto men; but it also exacteth the <HI>pra|ctise</HI>
of them. For, as it is obserued by the <HI>Romane Orator: Omnis optimarum
rerum cognitio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. de Orat. 148 a.</NOTE> <HI>at&abque; in ijs exercitatio, Philosophia nominatur: Not onely the
knowledge of euery good thing, but also a working and exercise therein, is that,
which can worthily be named Philosophie.</HI> Finally, whatsoeuer godly Lesson is
taught vs, either in the <HI>Metaphysicks,</HI> or <HI>Physicks,</HI> or <HI>Phisick,</HI> or <HI>Ethicks,</HI> or
<HI>Politicks,</HI> or <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> or <HI>Grammer,</HI> or <HI>Logick,</HI> or <HI>Rhetoricke,</HI> or any other
<HI>Arte;</HI> all that is taught vs by <HI>Philosophie.</HI> For, all these are nothing else
but the parts of <HI>Philosophie.</HI> And therefore, when the Apostle exhorteth vs,
<HI>to take heed, that no Man deceiue vs through Philosophy;</HI> he speaketh not against
true <HI>Philosophie:</HI> for that deceiueth no man: as is truely obserued by the Hea|then
<HI>Poet.</HI>
<Q><L>Nam ne&abque; decipitur Ratio, ne&abque; decipit vnqu&agrave;m.</L>
<L>For true Philosophie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manil. l. 2.</NOTE> praeserueth men</L>
<L>From all deceit, and not deceiueth them.</L></Q>
For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. de Divin. p. 125. a. Cic. de Nat. Deor. p. 75. b.</NOTE> in true <HI>Philosophie,</HI> there is, <HI>Nihil commentitijs fabellis loci: There is no
place for Fables.</HI> And true <HI>Philosophers</HI> be not, <HI>fabularum,</HI> but, <HI>rerum autho|res:</HI>
as the Orator teacheth vs. Therefore, it is not true <HI>Philosophie,</HI> which the
Apostle there reproueth: but certaine false, and sophisticall Doctrines, which
many Impostors obtruded to their hearers, vnder the false name of <HI>Philosophy.</HI>
He speaketh but of that <HI>Philosophie,</HI> which is falsely so called. For, true <HI>Philo|sophie</HI>
is the gracious gift of God.</P>
<P>2 Yea, and I finde it obserued, by some of the learned, that; as <HI>Philoso|phie</HI>
hath in it, an image of Gods goodnesse, in bringing so many, and so
great good things vnto vs: so hath it in it also (in diuers other respects) an
image and resemblance, not onely of the Deitie, but also of the Trinitie.
As I see the lines drawne in <HI>Zeegedinus</HI> his common places.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeeged. loc. com. p. 10.</NOTE> Which though
it be but, as it were, a monogrammal description, and a kind of rude draught,
as it were with a <HI>Cole:</HI> yet, because a man so learned, hath thought it worthy
to be published, I will not thinke it vnworthy to be here represented. His con|ceite
thereof, is this: That Whereas <HI>Philosophie</HI> hath three generall parts;
<HI>Naturall, Rationall,</HI> and <HI>Morall; Naturall Philosophie,</HI> which handleth the
causes of all things, representeth God the Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 17. 25.</NOTE> <HI>who is the Creator,</HI> and the
generall Cause of all things. <HI>Rationall Philosophie,</HI> which teache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h of rea|son
and vnderstanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1. 24.</NOTE> representeth God the Sonne, <HI>who is the wisdome of
his Father,</HI> and the sweet disposer of all things. And <HI>Morall Philosophie,</HI>
<PB N="356" REF="186">
which is the rule of well liuing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 16. 13.</NOTE> representeth the Holy Ghost; <HI>who is the pre|seruer,
and the guide of all men into truth,</HI> and vertuous life.</P>
<P>Yea, and the same resemblances may also bee seene, in all the minor parts
of the fore-named <HI>Philosophies,</HI> as well as in their totals. For first, as concer|ning
<HI>Naturall Philosophy:</HI> the parts thereof bee three, <HI>The Metaphysickes,</HI>
the <HI>Mathematickes,</HI> and the <HI>Physickes. The Metaphysickes,</HI> considering the
pure essence of things, doth therein resemble <HI>God the Father;</HI> who is nothing
else but a pure and simple essence, and the very first principle of all other
things. <HI>The Mathmetickes,</HI> considering of formes and figures, doe therein
resemble <HI>God the Sonne;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebrewes 1. 3.</NOTE> <HI>who is the character and ingrauen image of God the
Father The Physickes,</HI> considering the motions and operations of all natu|rall
bodies, doe therein resemble <HI>God the Holy Ghost;</HI> who is that <HI>diuine spirit,
by which all things both liue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 17. 28.</NOTE> <HI>and moue, and haue their being.</HI></P>
<P>Now secondly, for Rationall <HI>Philosophy:</HI> that hath three parts too: <HI>Gram|mer,
Logicke,</HI> and <HI>Rhetoricke. Grammer,</HI> which teacheth the forming and
expressing of words, resembleth God the Father; who formeth (like a
minde) and expresseth, (like a mouth) the eternall Word, his <HI>Sonne. Logicke,</HI>
which teacheth the power of reasoning, resembleth God the Sonne; who
is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>The high Reason, and Wisedome of his Father.</HI> And <HI>Rhetoricke,</HI> which
teacheth the faculty of perswading, resembleth the Holy Ghost; who both
giueth vnto men the power of perswasion, and the motion also to be perswa|ded
by speaking.</P>
<P>And thirdly, for <HI>Morall Philosophie;</HI> that likewise hath three parts: <HI>Eccle|siastickes,
Oeconomickes,</HI> and <HI>Politickes.</HI> The <HI>Ecclesiastickes,</HI> treating of the
knowledge of God the Creator, represent God the Father, in the authority
of his Creation. The <HI>Oeconomickes,</HI> treating of priuate life, and of those
prouisions which belong vnto it, represent God the Sonne, in the charity of
his Sustentation. And the <HI>Politickes,</HI> treating of Regiment, and well gouer|ning,
represent God the Holy Ghost, in the goodnesse of his Preseruing.
This is <HI>Zeegedin's</HI> comparison, as concerning that resemblance of the Holy
Trinity, which shineth in euery part of <HI>Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P>3 Now the Heathen, though they could not goe thus farre, as to see in
<HI>Philosophie</HI> an image of the <HI>Trinity</HI> (because that is a <HI>Mysterie,</HI> farre aboue
their <HI>Capacity</HI>) yet they could goe so farre, as to see, that <HI>Philosophy is the gift
of God, and not the inuention of any mortall man.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. 1. Tusc. p. 117.</NOTE> <HI>Tully</HI> calleth it expresly, both
<HI>Inventum Deorum,</HI> and, <HI>Donum Deorum,</HI> that is, <HI>both a sparke of Gods owne
diuine Wisdome; and also his gracious gift vnto men.</HI> Which when hee sent
vnto them, hee sent together with it, all other Arts and Sciences, to attend
vpon it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clem. Alex. l. 1. Strom. p. 136.</NOTE> As <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> hath truely obserued. <HI>Apparet, ill as libe|rales
Graecorum disciplinas, vn&agrave; cum ipsa Philosophia, venire devinit&ugrave;s ad Ho|minem.
It appeareth, that euen the liberall Arts of the Greekes, were sent
downe out of Heauen, together wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h Philosophie it selfe, vnto men.</HI> So that, as
the Orator very truely affirmeth: <HI>Hoc bono, nullum optabilius, nullum praestan|tius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. l. de Vnivers. p. 204. a.</NOTE>
<HI>ne&abque; datum est mortalium generi, Deorum concessu at&abque;, munere ne&abque; dabi|tur.
Then which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e was neuer any greater good, nor more to bee desired, ei|ther
giuen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. Epist. 14.</NOTE> <HI>or can be giuen by God vnto Men.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Seneca</HI> proueth it, by
this excellent reason&punc; <HI>That, if Philosophie were not giuen vnto men by God,
<PB N="357" REF="186">
they should be more beholding vnto Philosophie then to God. For they receiue so
many good things, by the meanes of Philosophy, as they doe from nothing else,
but onely from God himselfe.</HI> This is that high opinion, which hath bene held
of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> euen by the very Heathen.</P>
<P>4 And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poetry is the Gift of God.</NOTE> as they haue thought of <HI>Philosophy:</HI> so haue they likewise of
<HI>Poetry:</HI> That <HI>it</HI> is also the gift of God, and not a skill by any man inuented.
And this is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. de Divin p. 97. b.</NOTE> not onely by the <HI>Romane Orator</HI> confirmed: but also, euen by
the <HI>Poets</HI> themselues acknowledged. <HI>Democritus</HI> affirmeth directly: <HI>Nemi|nem,
sine furore, Poetam magnum esse posse. That no man can attaine, to bee a
great Poet, vnlesse hee first bee rapt with some divine and heauenly spirit.</HI> And
<HI>Plato,</HI> hee saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e. pr.</NOTE> <HI>That Poets vse to make all their excellent Poems; non arte, sed
divino affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tu capti; not by their owne Art, but by the inspiration of some di|vine
spirit.</HI> And <HI>Maximus Tyrius,</HI> speaking of <HI>Homer,</HI> and of his excellent
gift in <HI>Poetry,</HI> hee saith: <HI>That he was, surely, taught, by some of the Muses, if
not by god Apollo himselfe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Max. Tyr. Serm. 16. p. 194.</NOTE>
<Q>Illum docuit vel Musa Iovis, vel pulcher Apollo.</Q></P>
<P>And againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 195.</NOTE> a little after: <HI>Et Homeri &amp; Hesiodi carmina, vniversa&abque; illa anti|qua,
Musa, divinit&ugrave;s erat afflata.</HI> And that which these <HI>Philosophers</HI> affirme,
the <HI>Romane Orator</HI> confirmeth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. Orat. pro Archia Poeta. p. 189. a.</NOTE> <HI>Poeta, quasi divino quodam spiritu afflatur.
Euery Poet is inspired, with a kind of heauenly spirt.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Apollo,</HI> the <HI>Poets</HI>
speciall god, assumeth it vnto him: <HI>That Poesie is his gift.</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Per me concordant carmina nervis.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ovid l. 1. Me|tam. p. 39.</NOTE></L>
<L>The Poets strings,</L>
<L>And what he sings,</L>
<L>That all agree,</L>
<L>It is by mee.</L></Q>
Yea, and euen the very <HI>Poets</HI> themselues (stripping themselues of all the glory
of that diuine inuention) doe industriously maintaine the very same opini|on:
partly, by indirect insinuation: and partly, by direct confession. By insi|nuation,
in their inuocations to <HI>Apollo,</HI> and the <HI>Muses</HI> in the beginning of
their <HI>Poems. So</HI> Homer, in his <HI>Iliads.</HI>
<Q><L>Iram cane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. l. 1. Iliad.</NOTE> Dea, Pelidae Achillis.</L>
<L>O Goddesse, doe thou streyne,</L>
<L>Achilles angry veyne.</L></Q>
So againe in his <HI>Odysses.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Odys. l. 1.</NOTE>
<Q><L>Virum dic mihi, Musa, versutum.</L>
<L>Helpe me, &ocirc; Muse, to sing of such a man,</L>
<L>As was so wise a Poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ian.</L></Q>
Insinuating, that he could not tell what to say, if the Muse should not teach
him.</P>
<P>So <HI>Virgil,</HI> his Ape:
<Q><L>Dic mihi, Musa, virum.</L>
<L>Prompt me the Man, my Muse.</L></Q></P>
<P>So <HI>Nonius,</HI> in his <HI>Dionysiaca:</HI>

<L>Yea gods draw on, perpetuate my rime,</L>
<L>From Worlds first being, to my present time.</L></Q>
<PB N="358" REF="187">
And, as in the beginning of their <HI>poems,</HI> they vse to insinuate, that they cannot
goe forward, without the helpe of God: so, in the end of their <HI>poems,</HI> often|times,
they ascribe their felicity, in going so well forward, vnto his helpe.
<HI>Euripides,</HI> in many of his <HI>Tragoedies,</HI> prayeth for victory: thereby insinuating,
that victorie and excellency in <HI>Poetrie,</HI> is onely of God. Which, <HI>Agatho</HI>

<P>Neither doe the <HI>Poets,</HI> by these Insinuations onely, acknowledge, that

He <HI>droppeth</HI> it not in; but hee powreth it in. As wee may see in the Apostles,
when hee gaue them the gift of toungs. And therefore it is a very false posi|tion,
which is maintained by <HI>Xenophon: That all Arts haue beene found out,
rather by the wit of man (vsing the benefit of long time) then by Gods speciall

so great paine, and neuer so long time; if they were not assisted, with his
speciall blessing. And therfore <HI>Orpheus,</HI> in the fore-alledged place, he ascribeth
vnto God, not onely the beginning; but also the proceeding, in all kind of
learning.
<Q>Iupiter est Caput,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orpheus in Pansa c. 19. p. 79.</NOTE> &amp; Medium: Iovis omnia munus.</Q>
God is the Beginning, and God is the proceeding: and All is of Gods giuing.

And, <HI>It is onely in his Light, that we see Light. It is he</HI> (saith the <HI>Prophet Da|uid</HI>)
that teacheth a man knowledge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme 36. 9. 94. 10.</NOTE> <HI>It is he</HI> (saith the <HI>Prophet Daniel</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel 2. 21.</NOTE>) <HI>that gi|ueth

any thing, which hee hath not of his teaching: no nor can haue neither. For
he giueth, not onely the possession of all Arts; but also all <HI>possibility</HI> of attay|ning
vnto them. He both teacheth men; and he giueth them the capacitie
to learne. Hee giueth docilitie, together with his doctrine. <HI>It is hee</HI> (saith
<PB N="360" REF="188">
the <HI>Prophet) that giueth an eare to heare,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay 50. 4.</NOTE> <HI>as the learned.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and this also, euen by the Heathen themselues, is acknowledged.
<HI>Strepsiades,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristoph in Nub. Act. 1. Sce. 2. p. 163. Aelian p. 423.</NOTE> when hee entred into the Schoole of <HI>Socrates,</HI> to learne his ab|struse
Arts; <HI>hee prayed vnto the gods, to lend him their assistance.</HI> So that,
though <HI>Docility</HI> may seeme to bee a gift of Nature; yet, euen that nature is,
the gift of God. Nature may giue the gift of <HI>docility</HI> to <HI>vs:</HI> but God gi|ueth
the gift of <HI>docility</HI> to <HI>it.</HI> So that, all our capability of receiuing any
Art, is taught, euen by the Heathen, to be giuen of God. And we must flye
aboue nature, if wee will rightly reduce it, to his true Originall Author. God
both giueth all knowledge, vnto them that haue it; and all capacity to re|ceiue
it, vnto them that haue it not. And thus (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> hath truely obser|ued)
it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb l. 13. de Prapar. c. 7. p. 278. Lib. 2. c. 1. Sect. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Divinum verbum, quod omnes Artes hominibus suggerit; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">is onely
the Diuine word, which giues vnto all men, all manner of Arts and knowledge.</HI>
But this point hath also beene touched by me, <HI>heretofore.</HI> And therefore I
will not presse it, in this place, any more.</P>
<P>6 Let vs therefore now come downe, to the lowest degree of <HI>Arts:</HI> that
is, <HI>Manuary</HI> and <HI>Mechanicall:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mechanicall Arts are the gifts of God.</NOTE> and we shall see, that euen they, as well as the
<HI>liberall,</HI> are, by the Heathen, confessed to bee the gifts of God. <HI>Trismegistus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trisineg. Pi|mand. Dial. 10. p. 424.</NOTE>
saith of all kindes of knowledge in generall: that, <HI>Scientia est Dei donum:
That all manner of knowledge, is the gift of God;</HI> And <HI>Seneca,</HI> of all humane
<HI>Arts</HI> in particular:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec. l. 4. de Be|nesic. c. 6. p. 50.</NOTE> <HI>Ne&abque; enim nostra, haec, quae invenimus, dixeris; non magis
qu&agrave;m qu&ograve;d crescimus. Insita sunt nobis omnium Artium semina. Sed Magi|ster,
ex occulto, Deus producit ingenia. Doe not call those things our workes,
which we seeme to haue inuented: no more then it is our worke, that we grow vp.
The seedes indeed of all good Arts, are sowne in our mindes. But yet there is a
secret Master, within vs, which giueth vs our wits.</HI> And that is God himselfe.
So <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> vnto the same purpose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m. Alex. l. 5. Strom. p, 281.</NOTE> <HI>Artes omnes divina Ratio
docet. Non en&igrave;m homo Artem aliquam invenit: sed Deus affert. Hominis
en&igrave;m ratio, orta est a divina ratione. It is onely Gods wisdome, that teacheth all
Arts and Sciences vnto men. For man cannot finde out any Art of himselfe:
it is God that brings it to him. But be it that man inuented them; why yet all
humane reason doth draw his Originall from Gods diuine wisdome.</HI> So that
all is due to God. For, as <HI>Iob,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 32. 8.</NOTE> in his Booke, teacheth vs: <HI>Though there bee a
Spirit in a man; yet it is the inspiration of the Almighty, that giueth vnder|standing.</HI>
Though a man haue, by nature, a spirit in him; yet hath not that
spirit the light of vnderstanding, vnlesse <HI>the Father of Lights</HI> inspire the same
into him. And this, euen <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe also teacheth: who expresly af|firmeth;
<HI>That, though God haue</HI> giuen docility into mens soules, by nature; yet
hath he not giuen them doctrine it selfe, by nature: but giueth that of him|selfe,
out of his owne speciall grace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 12. de Theol. cap 15.</NOTE> <HI>A Natura non inest homini nisi docilitas;
non autem doctrina: eius&abque; animus creatus est, non eruditus, sed erudibilis.
Man hath onely, by Nature, the power of docilitie, he hath not, by nature, the ha|bit
of doctrine. His soule is created to be capable of learning: it is not actually
created learned.</HI> And therefore, as he noteth in another place: <HI>In all a mans
learning,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. l. 8. de Theol. cap. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Intellectus operatur, vt agens secundum; ac; per primum efficit, quic|quid
efficit: His vnderstanding worketh, but as a second Agent; and doth all it
doth, by the vertue of an higher vnderstanding, which is aboue it.</HI> And this, euen
<PB N="361" REF="188">
the Heathen acknowledge to be true, as well in all inferior and Mechanicall
Arts, as in the liberall and ingenuous. And therefore they haue ascribed the
inuention of all the seuerall manuarie Arts, vnto their seuerall gods: As
namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato. in Convi|vio. p. 428.</NOTE> to <HI>Hercules,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pol. Virg de. In|vent. l. 3. c. 6. p. 227.</NOTE> the first inuention of the <HI>purple dye:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virg. l. 1. Georg. p. 36.</NOTE> Agriculture,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diod. Sic. l. 6.</NOTE> to
<HI>Ceres:</HI>
<Q><L>Prima Ceres Ferro mortales vertere terram</L>
<L>Instituit:&mdash;</L></Q>
<HI>Navigation</HI> to <HI>Neptune:</HI> as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> writeth: whence his name is ety|mologized
by <HI>Tully:</HI>
<Q><L>Neptunus &agrave; nando:</L>
<L>He is named Neptune from nauigation.</L></Q></P>
<P>Whereby it appeareth, that, euen they themselues thought, the inuention
of the meanest Mechanicall Art, to proceed from a more diuine vnderstan|ding
then dwelleth in the heart, or in the head, of any man. And thus farre
they went right. But now, heere againe, they erre; that they ascribed those
Arts, vnto their false gods, which of right do belong vnto the true God.
For, all those Arts, are onely his gifts. He is their true Author, and Inuen|tor.
So that, without sacriledge, they cannot be ascribed, vnto any other.
And therefore God himselfe, <HI>Who will not giue his honour vnto any other,</HI>
calleth home all those Arts, and chalengeth them by name, to be his owne in|uentions.</P>
<P>He taught the first <HI>Shipwright,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 6. 14. Psal. 127. 1.</NOTE> how to make his <HI>Ship.</HI> Hee teacheth the
<HI>Carpenter, how to build his house.</HI> He teacheth the <HI>Husbandman,</HI> how to plow
his land.
<Q><L>Ille colit terras:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virg. Eclog. 3. p. 8.</NOTE></L>
<L>He tilleth the Earth.</L>
<L>The Earth Man tilleth,</L>
<L>As God him teacheth.</L></Q>
Hee teacheth the Arte of <HI>Graving,</HI> in all kinde of mettals; and of <HI>Car|ving,</HI>
in either Wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 35. 32, 33.</NOTE> or Stone. Hee teacheth the Arts, both of
<HI>Weauing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE> and <HI>Imbroydering;</HI> and of <HI>curious working, in all kinde of
Needle worke:</HI> and <HI>of all such like other cunning inuentions;</HI> as hee ad|deth
in that place: shutting-vp his owne enumeration, with that generall
Conclusion, that no other particular should bee left out of it. All these
seuerall <HI>Artificers,</HI> hee professeth, that <HI>he filleth with the spirit of know|ledge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 35. 31.</NOTE> and <HI>vnderstanding;</HI> in all their seuerall <HI>Arts.</HI> Yea, and that which
is very worthy the noting, hee assumeth to himselfe, <HI>to giue the Art to
teach them, as well as to practise them.</HI> Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE> and though hee bee, <HI>The most
High:</HI> yet hee chalengeth <HI>the inuention, euen of that simple Art,</HI> which
among the rest may seeme the most low: <HI>I haue created the Smith, that
bloweth the Coales in the fire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isay 54. 16.</NOTE> <HI>and him that bringeth forth an Instrument,
for his worke.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodoret. Ser. 4. de Provident. To. 2. p. 591. Zanch, l, de Ope|ribus Dei p. 61<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> But this point is largely handled, both by <HI>Theodoret,</HI> and by
<HI>Zanchius.</HI> And therefore I will prosecute it no farther. Thus now we see,
who is the true Author, of all those <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> which the Heathens
haue ascribed vnto their false gods. And withall, that there is none of them
so meane, which hee hath thought vnworthy to bee his owne inuention.
So that now it appeareth, that there is not any Arte, neither <HI>Liberal,</HI> nor
<PB N="362" REF="189">
<HI>illiberall,</HI> from the <HI>Metaphysickes,</HI> to the <HI>Mechanicks,</HI> from the high|est,
to the lowest, but that some way or other, it leadeth a man to
God. Which is the maine scope, and intent of this second Booke.
Heere wee should proceede to the third probation of our first generall
head, argued, and vrged, from <HI>The Structure of Mans body, &amp;c.</HI>
But the Hand of <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, at this present,
