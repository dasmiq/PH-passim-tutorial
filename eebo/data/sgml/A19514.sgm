<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT Reuerend Father in God, <HI>Iames,</HI> Lord Bishop of <HI>Winton,</HI> Deane of his Maie|sties Chappell-Royall, and one of his Ma|iesties most Honourable Priuie Counsaile.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SHortly after his Maiesties de|parture from <HI>Drumfreis,</HI> to <HI>Carleel,</HI> I posted away these two little Sermons, vnder hope they might serue for witnesses of my willing affection to haue attended his Maiestie in the rest of the iourney, if the condition, either of my person, which is infirme, or of the place, which was no longer pertinent to me, could so haue permitted. How they were miscarried, I know not, belike they haue taken in the <HI>We|sterne</HI> way, wherein their father and <HI>fellowes</HI> had not been accustomed to walke before them:
<PB REF="3">
alway, after long wandring, they returned backe againe vnto me, but not without good tydings; for the one of them told me, he was certainly in|formed, to find fauour with my Lord Duke of <HI>Lennox</HI> his Grace, who still kept in mind that <HI>Welcome,</HI> giuen to his Maiesty in the Royall Chappell of the Palace of <HI>Holy-roode-house,</HI> at his Maiesties comming in. The other seemed to mee no lesse confident that he would be coun|tenanced by my Lord Marques of <HI>Bucking|ham,</HI> who did likewise remember the admoniti|on giuen to the worthy Nobles of <HI>England</HI>; as also, that hearty <HI>Acclamation</HI> of the people, who seemed to powre out their hearts with their voices, and cryes, for his Maiesties preserua|tion in the Church of <HI>Drumfreis,</HI> at his Maie|sties going out.</P>
<P>Both these I easily beleeued, when I called to mind the continual, and constant kindnesse, which through long experience I had found of the one, and that rare humanity of the other, euident to|ward all, and whereof it pleased his Lordship when he was here, to giue me a speciall proofe. Yet could I not presume to present such base, and vnapparelled Pilgrimes to so Noble, and high Personages.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">Sure I am, if they could haue ouertaken that Reuerend, Graue, &amp; most Learned Prelate, my Lord Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> they had not wanted a Pa|trone; for I knew from himselfe, that nothing comming from the B. of <HI>Candida Casa,</HI> would be v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">welcome to his Lordship for <HI>Amphibalus</HI> sake, harbored in <HI>Mona,</HI> by <HI>Crathlint</HI> King of Scots, and protected there, with the Christians that fled with him from the bloudy persecution of <HI>Dioclesian.</HI> But when I had considered all, I thought it most kindly, since they come from the Deane of his Maiesties Chappell here, they should take their course directly to your Lord|ship, Deane of his Highnesse Royall Chappell there. My Lord, they are Strangers; I trust your Lordship will vse them kindly; all the fa|uour I craue, is, that your Lordship would once bring them vnder his Maiesties eye, there to re|ceiue their sentence, whether they shall be com|mitted to the Presse, that they wander no more; or then returned home againe, vntill they gather further strength, to doe for themselues. So rests,</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This verse is to be resolued in a promise.</NOTE>This verse, by some of the Diuines, is resolued in a Prayer, by others in a Promise, both agreeable to the analogie of Faith, but the second most conso|nant to the course of this Psalme: for in the first two verses, <HI>Dauid</HI> sendeth vp his Prayer to the Lord, in the remanent sixe, the Lord sends downe his an|swere to <HI>Dauid,</HI> full of comfortable promises, where|of this is the last, and hath in it these circumstances to be considered.</P>

lifted vp his eyes to the Lord, protesting that his helpe came from him, who made the heauen, and the earth, receiues this answere, <HI>The Lord shall pre|serue thy comming, and thy going.</HI> Thirdly, the bene|fit promised, is preseruation. Last, the qualities of this preseruation; these are two-fold; First, it is to|tall, <HI>He shall preserue thee in all thy waies both comming and going.</HI> Next, it is perpetuall, <HI>From henceforth, and for euer shall the Lord preserue thee.</HI> Thus haue we the little body of this Text shortly anatomized, both the method and matter thereof explained.</P>
<P>The first circumstance then is carried in the first word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First circum|stance is, who makes the promise, to wit, the Lord. 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.9. <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.30.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord.</HI> This praise belongeth to the Lord, that He, and none but He preserueth such as are his: <HI>The Lord keepeth the feete of his Saints,</HI> said <HI>Anna</HI> the Mother of <HI>Samuel.

But deere Soueraigne, let it not be offensiue to your Maiesty, that you are com|passed heere with an assembly of mourners, whose faces are watred with ouerflowing teares of their heart.

Let vs therefore moderate our mourning, let our passions giue place to his royall pleasure, let our hearts with joy and cheerefulnesse send vp these our prayers.
