<L><HI>A</HI> Cyuill warre, doth God and man abhorre,</L>
<L>Hit staynes the ayre, and blots y^e earth w^t bloud</L>
<L>Hit is a plague, a pestlence botch and soore,</L>
<L>that eates vp Realmes, as worme co~sumes y^e wood.</L>
<L>Hit venom castes, as farre as <HI>Nilus</HI> flood,</L>
<L>Hit poysoneth all, it toucheth any wheare,</L>
<L>Hit is of kinde, much worsse then horses heare.</L>
<L>That lyes in donge, where on vyle Serpents brede</L>
<L>Rebellion first, sprang out of vipers sede,</L>
<L>And nourisht was, in naughtie canckred minde,</L>
<L>a lothsome lodge, for diu'lish geasts we finde.</L>

<L>Beware ye come, not neare that Adders neast,</L>
<L>That heads &amp; harts and bowells stings by sleight.</L>
<L>Great fame you winne, in countreis cause to feight</L>
<L>Great shame you get, with Rebelles for to hold,</L>
<L>Great plagues therof in Bookes you see enrold.</L>
<L>Great wracke &amp; ruen, domestike braules do bring,</L>
<L>They want no skourge, that striues against a king</L>
<L>For right shall raigne, and rule as reason <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">hoes,</L>
<L>And sway the sword, in spight of secret foes.</L>

<L>&para; Eche other griefe, is heald with plaisters fyne,</L>
<L>This findes no salue, so deepe the corzye goes,</L>

<L>And yet the Lord, that sittes aboue the starres,</L>
<L>Brings them to naught, that seketh Ciuill warres</L>
<L>The best reward, that euer Rebelles found.</L>
<L>Was Tiborne threed, and hempen halters round,</L>
<L>Or elles a choppe, of churlish botchers are,</L>

<L>And naked birdes, when beggry is in prime,</L>
<L>Do snatch for shroud, on foules that fethers haue.</L>
<L>Rebellion thus, with paynted vizage braue,</L>
<L>Leads out poore soules (y^t knowes not gold fro~ glas)</L>

<L>Who takes delight, to cogge and foyst the Dice,</L>

<L>When practise proud, takes place in people mild,</L>
<L>The Ciuill swaine groes sauege rude and wilde.</L>
