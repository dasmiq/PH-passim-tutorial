<HEAD>The Translator to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_COurteous Reader (for so I hope to finde thee) so nefande and execrable, I confesse, haue beene the practises of the <HI>Pa|pists</HI> in this exorbitant age of the world, as late barbarous attempts at home, &amp; a later bloudy deed abroad can well testifie: that no man I thinke hath a toung so Satirically invectiue, that hee can any waye make the bitternes of his speech correspon|dent to the cruelty of their actions. Where|fore these Apologues long since fitted to their follies, in comparison with it, may seeme vnto thee like <HI>Domitions</HI> pricking of flies, in regard of managing the astaires of his Em|pire: yet good vse may be made of them in these our dayes. For as in former time among the Romans (who were neuer almost with|out warres) there were <HI>Ludi Circences,</HI> and <HI>Naumachiae,</HI> plaies as they accounted them,
<PB REF="3">
but in nature consonant to their present im|ployments; for they did both yeeld recreati|on for the present, and also excercise them a|gainst any future ocasion; so in these our daies of warfare against the trecheries of the Pa|pists, after thy wiriting against their errors, or reading of graue controuersies, or at least more serious consideration of their irreligious practices against vs; these Apologues may serue vnto thee as a recreation, and yet with|all they wil afford thee a manifest declaration of some of their sortish superstitions, &amp; good arguments against them: for vnder a fabulous <HI>superficies,</HI> thou shalt find true substance, and in a seeming tale manifesteth truth. Where|fore as <HI>Virgil</HI> on a time hauing some of old <HI>Ennius</HI> his workes in his hands, said to one asking him what hee did, <HI>Ex Ennis stercoro aurum colligo:</HI> so maist thou, reading in this booke answeare any demaunding what thou dost, that thou gatherest gold out of the dust of Apologues. But (that I may come to my selfe) if the plainenes of the translation bee not pleasing to curious eares, I Apologize for my selfe two waies; first, that mine Author shall excuse mee, whom I so followed as one intending to translate, and not to make a new. Secondly, (wherein also I excuse mine Au|thor)
<PB REF="3">
that the forme of the Apologues is such, namely, a relation of Dialogues, where <HI>in|quam</HI> and <HI>inquit</HI> is oft inferred, that it could not bee otherwise. Yet as gold is not to bee refused, because it is digged out of the earth, nor pearles, because they are found in the sands: so I hope these witty conceites, will not bee distastfull to any, although they bee not related in curious tearmes; and that I shall not deserue dispraise in immitating him in words, of whom I borrowed the subiect of my speech. And so committing my selfe &amp; my translation to thy censure, I commit thee and my selfe to him that will censure vs both: wishing thee as thou likest this first booke, so to expect more of me hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>MERRY IESTES of Popes, Munkes, and Friers: Wherein are discouered the Abuses of the Pope and his followers.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The first Apologue, in which is shewed, not onely that the Pope may erre in faith, but also what is the faith of Popes and their Pre|lates.</HEAD>
<P>_A Romaine Courtier, in a cer|taine conference, said, that the Pope might erre in faith: for which he was presently appre|hended, and sent vnto prison. And because hee was a man of great credit, the Pope sent one of his Cardinals to cra|mine him; and hee not only constantly main|tained his former sp&eacute;eches, but also said a|gaine in the Cardinals presence: that the Pope might erre in faith; the Cardinall told him that h&eacute;e was as hereticke to bel&eacute;eue it. But hee answering, said, what if I haue knowne wherein the Pope did erre in faith, shall I be accounted an heretick for beleeuing the truth? wherein (said the Cardinall) haue
<PB N="2" REF="6">
you perceiued that the Pope did erre in faith; Pope <HI>Paul</HI> (said he) on a time, as he was at dinner, said in my hearing, to many yet li|uing, whom I can produce for witnesses, that he bel&eacute;eued that he should recouer <HI>Placentia</HI> before he died, but yet died before he recoue|red it; therefore I am perswaded that he did erre, and was deceiued in faith. Then the Cardinall answered and said, we thought that you had spoke of the faith in spirituall things; no (said the Courtier) I spoke onely of faith in matters of this world, for as touch|ing the faith in things which appertaine vnto God, so farre am I from knowing whether he erre or not, that I am altogether ignorant whether the Popes, or you their Prelates haue any bel&eacute;efe at all.</P>

<HEAD>The 2. Apologue by which is shewed that the Pope cannot deliuer soules out of Purga|tory.</HEAD>
<P>IN the time of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> Pope <HI>Clement</HI> be|ing affraid, withdrew himself together with some of the Prelates which were his friends, into the Castle of the Holy Angel, &amp; being there as it were shut up in prison, a
<PB N="3" REF="6">
Romane Gentleman said; vntill this time I haue alwayes beleeued that the Pope could deliuer soules out of Purgatory, but s&eacute;eing that at this present h&eacute;e cannot deliuer him|selfe, and his deare friends out of prison, I am constrained to beleeue, that hee is much lesse able to deliuer soules out of Purgatory,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The 3. Apologue, by which is discouered the folly of Priests and Monkes, who pray vnto God singing.</HEAD>
<P>A Certaine Priest went vnto Rome so beg a Benefice which was void, and such good friends he had, that he was permit|ted to enter into the Consistory, the Pope and Cardinalls being there assembled, where deuoutly falling downe vppon his kn&eacute;es hee began to demand the Benefice singing after the same manner hee was went to sing the Letanie: saying with a loud voyce: Most ho|ly Father, I humbly craue such a Benefice, heare me I bes&eacute;ech you: then turning himselfe towards the Cardinalls, and naming them one after another (singing as h&eacute;e did before) he said, Most reuerent Lord (such a one) pray for mee that I may obtaine the Benefice, which I desire of the Pope. They hearing
<PB N="4" REF="7">
this began all to laugh, being notwithstan|ding very angry with him, because they thought that hee had mocked them. Where|fore the master of the Ceremonies went vnto him and reprehended him, saying, that h&eacute;e ought to aske that which h&eacute;e would haue with greater reuerence: to whom he an|swered and said, I know not how to desire a fauour of the Pope and Cardinals with grea|ter reuerence and deuotion, then with the same wherewith the Popes (who as we hold cannot erre) haue taught me to begge things h&eacute;edefull for mee, of Christ, the Apostles, and other Saints. And because, when I would haue any thing of Christ, or of the Saints, I pray for it singing (as the Popes haue taught vs to doe in the Letanics) I should neuer haue imagined that it had b&eacute;ene ill to doe as I haue done. At this they all laughed, and granted his request.</P>

<HEAD>The 4. Apologue, by which is shewed what force the Councils haue, as also, vpon what the Popedome is founded.</HEAD>
<P>POpe <HI>Paul</HI> on a time exhorted some of his Prelates to study the holy Scriptures, that at the Councils they might be able to o|uerthrow
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and confound the reasons and ar|guments of the Lutherans; and one of them said it is needlesse that we should take so much paines in vaine, and to no purpose, s&eacute;eing that your Holinesse may easily, and with a few words annihilate them all. When the Pope asked him by what meanes &amp; h&eacute;e answered, in not accepting, but reprouing, and condem|ning, as heresie all that they shall say contra|ry to your profit. The Pope confessed that ind&eacute;ed that was true, but neuerthelesse h&eacute;e thought it good that they thence shewed some reasons which moued him therevnto, as also that the Popedome and doctrine thereof had good foundation. It is not best for vs (said the Prelate) to read the Scriptures to that purpose, for they are contrary vnto vs; but wee must betake our selues to your and our decrees. Decretals, and extrauagants: then the Pope answered and said, although nothing may be directly had out of the Scriptures, yet it is, good to study them, that when n&eacute;ed shall require, we may be able to cauill, and wrest them to our purpose, and phantasie.</P>

<HEAD>The 5. Apologue, whereby is shewed that Simonie is a sinfull thing, and whose succes|sours the Popes Prelates are.</HEAD>
<P>A Certaine Romane made his confession (of some matters which must not be spoken of) to a Confessor in the Temple of S. <HI>Peter</HI> in Rome; but the Confessor would not absolue him, vnlesse h&eacute;e would giue him ten Crownes: wherefore the Romane said, <HI>Gratis accepistis gratis date,</HI> fr&eacute;ely you haue receiued, fr&eacute;ely giue. To this the Confessor answered he lies in his throat, who either saith, or will say these words: for I had not this office <HI>gratis,</HI> but I bought it, and it cost me more then an hundred Crownes. Then the Romane said, do you not know that these are the wordes of Iesus Christ, will you say that Christ doth lye? To this the Confessor answered, although these words are his, hee spoke them not to vs, for w&eacute;e can at no time haue of the Pope the least office, Benefice, or fauour that is without mony: wherefore you must adresse your selues to the Apostles, to whom Christ spake these words. It is true said the Roman, he spake to them ind&eacute;ed, but he also meant thereby all that should succ&eacute;ed
<PB N="7" REF="8">
them: If it be so (said the Confessor) w&eacute;e are not the Apostles successors, but theirs who bought and sold in the Temple.</P>

<HEAD>The 6. Apologue, by which is discouered the folly of those who beleeue in Reliques and worship them.</HEAD>
<P>A Priest of <HI>Geneua</HI> moued with deuoti|on, trauelled to visit certaine holy pla|ces, and after a time returned home againe, but with much lesse deuotion then h&eacute;e had be|fore, and with his purse quite empty. And being asked of many where the Reliques were which h&eacute;e had brought to regaine the mony which h&eacute;e had spent in his iourney? af|ter a little deliberation he answered, that he had brought two most excellent and most ho|ly Reliques: and began to tell of them (but secretly) to his friends, intreating them that they would not speake openly of them, for feare least they should be taken from him by the <HI>Signeurie,</HI> withall promising them that if they would be secret, he would impart the sight of them, so that they would make him some contribution towards his great expen|ces in procuring them; finally many being desirous to see them gaue him money: and
<PB N="8" REF="9">
then he (hauing before ordered his busines) drew forth a piece of silke, a goodly paire of Dreshornes, and holding them vp, said vnto the people, that h&eacute;e had brought them from mount <HI>Sina,</HI> and that they were the hornes wherewith <HI>Moyses</HI> descended from thence, after h&eacute;e had ended his sp&eacute;eches with God. Then taking a viol in his hand, he said that therein was contained the breath of Iesus Christ reserued by his mother when h&eacute;e was a little one; and that h&eacute;e had now brought it from <HI>Bethleem</HI>: H&eacute;e had no sooner finished these things, but all the Citty was full of the newes, so that he was presently called before the <HI>Seigneury</HI> &amp; demanded whether it were true that h&eacute;e had brought with him <HI>Moyses</HI> hornes, and the breath of Christ? and h&eacute;e an|swered that it was true: then they asked him if he were not ashamed to make men worship a paire of hornes: If you (said the Priest) are not ashamed to make men worship and fall downe before the taile of the Asse on which Christ rode on Palme Sunday; Dught I to thinke it a shame to make men worship these glorious hornes of <HI>Moyses</HI>? &amp; dost thou bel&eacute;eue (said one of the <HI>Seigneurie</HI> that these are the very hornes of <HI>Moyses,</HI> and that in this viol there is the very breath of

<P>POpe <HI>Iulius</HI> the third, on the day of his co|ronation, made a great feast, especially for the Ladies of S. <HI>Peters</HI> Palace; amongst which there was one who said, wee women are the veriest fooles in the world, and being asked why? she answered, because when Ie|sus Christ went to be crucified, hee went to his soueraigne tryumph ouer sinne, death, and hell, to the great glory of his heauenly father, and to our saluation, and perfect hap|pinesse, and then we wept, and made great lamentation: but now on the contrary at this mans coronation, whence will proc&eacute;ede the great dishonour of God, and the certaine

<HEAD>The 8 Apologue, in which is shewed plain|ly that there is no Purgatory.</HEAD>
<P>THere was in <HI>Rome</HI> an excellent and lear|ned preacher; of whom Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the third (as of one in whom hee put great confi|dence) demaunded on a time secretly, whe|ther he did belieue that the Pope had (as men said) so great power and authority ouer Pur|gatory that hee could thence set at liberty all the soules therein, and cause that none should euer come thither againe? but the preacher durst not bouldly speake his minde herein, and would by no meanes say any thinge a|gainst his owne conscience, and therefore re|mained in doubt. Wherefore the Pope (per|ceiuing it) gaue him incouragement, saying that he would haue him speake his mind free|ly, without feare, or rather respect. Then seeing that the Pope desired to knowe the truth, hee answered that he had no power at all ouer Purgatory. Againe (perceiuing that the Pope did greatly wonder at his words) he said thus vnto him; Holy Father, had
<PB N="11" REF="10">
your Predecessors as great power and au|thority as you, or had they lesse? the Pope made answer that it was equall to his: then (replied the Preacher) if they had as great power as you, and by the same were able at any time to empty Purgatory, as you sup|pose your selfe able to doe, it is fit we belieue that among so many Popes, some one was found so ful of charity to free al soules thence for euer. The Pope answered that he could not tell that. But (said the Preacher) I know this well, that Iesus Christ the Soueraigne Priest, hath of himselfe infinite charity and power; and seeing that with his owne pro|per blood he hath truely and for euer purged the soules of his elect, what need haue they of any other purgation? wherefore I know not what that power is, whereof you brag and boast so much.</P>

course of nature our time in this life could be but short, and that we with patience had long expected it; by exquisit practises, by liberall promises, by bragging what great friendes wee had to terrifie the Cardinalls if they did not elect vs to be Pope: and finally by subtill sleights, and a large conscience.</P>

<HEAD>The 10. Apologue, by which is in part dis|couered the auarice and superstition of the Priests and Monkes.</HEAD>
<P>A Rich Seigneur of <HI>Paris,</HI> being very sicke the thiefe of all the Religious in the ci|tie went at seuerall times to visite him, more ind&eacute;ede respecting the guiftes and rewards they hoped for at his hands, then his soules safety. And the Cordeliers exhorted him to call vpon and put his trust in S. <HI>Francis,</HI> the <HI>Iacobins</HI> in S. <HI>Dominicke</HI>: and the other in those Saints of whose order they were Mo~ks The Priest likewise exhorted him that hee would commend himselfe into the hands of <HI>S. Peter,</HI> or of the Saint to whom their Church was didicated. The Noble man perceiuing this diuersity &punc; caused them all to be sent for, and to be assembled into his Chamber, and then said thus vnto them. When I first fell
<PB N="13" REF="11">
sicke, I caused all the Phisitians in the City to come vnto m&eacute;e: and they could not agr&eacute;e a|mong themselues to giue me a medicine, be|cause that euery one of them, to s&eacute;eme more learned then the rest, reproued all that the o|ther would haue giuen m&eacute;e, &amp; counselled mee to take that which he would administer vn|to mee. Therefore calling them togither, I said vnto them, euery one of you would haue me take the Phisicke which he hath ordained for m&eacute;e, now if I should take all, they would bring my body into worse estate then it is al|ready if not kill m&eacute;e, and if I should resolue to take but one, I know not which to choose: wherefore you shall goe into this next cham|ber, from whence you shall not come, vntill you doe agr&eacute;e to giue me a medicine approued of you all to be the best; then the Phisitians, knowing that long fasting would bring dan|ger to their owne bodies, did quickely con|sent and brought me physicke; assuring mee that it was farre better, and more agreable to my maladie then any they would before haue giuen m&eacute;e. Now in like manner, you be|ing come to medicine my soule, are different among your selues; for euery one of you doth exhort me to call vpon such a Saint, and I, by reason of my great sicknes and debeli|ty
<PB N="14" REF="12">
of body, am not able to make prayers per|ticulerly to so many. Therefore goe you into the Phisitians Chamber, and assure your selues that y&eacute;e shall not come forth thence vn|till you tell mee all with one accord, to whom especially and onely I ought to commend my selfe for my soules safety. Then the Priests, and Monkes, perceiuing themselues likely to fall into two inconueniences, that they must either y&eacute;eld one to another, which they would by no meanes doe, or else be opressed with hunger, which their gluttonous paunch|es could not endure, found out a third way to auoid both; which was, that seeing none of them had made mention of Iesus Christ, they would exhort the sicke man to commend him|selfe to him aloane. Which when they had done, the noble man demanded of them, whe|ther they all iudged it much better for him to commend himselfe into the hands of Iesus Christ, then of any of the Saints? and they all answered that it was better. If you are so perswaded (said h&eacute;e) why had you not said as much at the beginning? Is it possible that (when you exhorted mee to call vpon your Saints) you should be so ignorant, that you knew, it not more expedient for m&eacute;e that I commended my selfe wholly and onely to

Iesus Christ? Get y&eacute;e hence, get y&eacute;e hence, you are a company of murderers, th&eacute;eues, and wicked fellows, fraughted with auarice, lying and hypocrisie: and so with great dis|grace, hee commanded them to be thrust out at the doores.</P>

To this <HI>Caesar</HI> answered, that he was con|tent to doe so, if that h&eacute;e in like manner would resigne the Bishopricke of Rome to a|nother, the which, by his owne reason hee ought to doe, contenting himselfe to be Pope, and uniuersal Bishop of Bishops (as he him|selfe said he was) and not to be the particuler Bishop of Rome also.

<P>THere was a Bishop of Denmarke, who because he dwelt farre from Rome, and that diuers occasions might happen in his Bishoprick to cause him to send to the Pope; did for a thousand crownes buy the Popes whole authority, with this <HI>prouiso,</HI> that hee should vse the farce no farther then the pre|cincts of his owne Dicresse: notwithstand|ing he so behaued himselfe: that complaints of him were brought vnto Rome, so that the Pope cited him to make his personall appea|rance before him, and the Bishop at the day appointed was present. Now because that hee was a man of great authority, the Pope held the Articles whereof hee was accused in his owne hands, and examined him before all the Prelates, saying, wee haue vnderstood that you haue charged your people with ma|ny new fasts ordained by you, as if ours were not sufficient, but that you must sup|ply our imperfections: and you (said the Bishop)
<PB N="17" REF="13">
haue grieued the poeple with fasts ordai|ned by you, as if that the temperance and so|briety giuen vnto men by God were not suf|ficient, but vnperfect, vnlesse you added som|thing thereunto. Againe said the Pope, wee gaue you our authority, to the end that you should make men obserue our ordinances, and not to forge a new Christianity: so (said the Bishop) Iesus Christ hath giuen his au|thority vnto you &punc; to this end and purpose, that you should cause men to keepe his com|maundements, and not by adding yours thereunto, to make a new Christian religi|on. We should haue liked it well (said the Pope) if for the good of your Church, you had made any statute or ordinance, so that you had not also made the breach thereof a mortall sinne, but you haue obliged the peo|ple thereunto vpon paine of eternall death, and which is more, haue more seuerely pun|ished the transgressors of your commaunde|ments then the transgressours of ours. In like manner (said the Bishop) if you had or|dained any indifferent thing for the commo|dity of your Church, and not tyed men to the keeping thereof vnder paine of damnation, it had not b&eacute;ene displeasing to God: but you on the contrary haue decr&eacute;ed that whosoeuer
<PB N="18" REF="14">
will not obserue your commandements, shall goe to hell; and doe inflict more grieuous pun|nishment on those which transgresse your or|dinances, then on those which break the com|maundements of God; wherefore I haue fol|lowed you, as your good and obedient sonne. Then the Pope said againe vnto him, but wherefore haue you commaunded, that in your fasts the people shall drinke but once? If you (said the Bishop) haue ordained, that in your fasts men shall eate but once; why may not I hauing all your authority (so that I can by no meanes erre) commaund that they drinke but once in mine? but were it not much better (said the Pope) that they dranke thr&eacute;e or fower times, rather then poure down so much at once to make their eies stare, and their bellies cracke againe? So (said the Bi|shop) they who eate but once in your fasts doe so gorge themselues that their bellies are euen ready to breake, and were it not much more profitable for the health of their bodies, if they made thr&eacute;e or foure moderate repasts of that which they gourmundize at once? But what folly is it of you (said the Pope) that in your fasts you haue wholly denied bread? what would you haue them eate? And what I pray you (said the Bishop) hath mooued
<PB N="19" REF="14">
you to forbid the vse of flesh, and egges, and milke in your fasts? what would you haue them eate in those dayes? Other things (said the Pope) ordained for their sustenance; men may likewise liue without bread (said the Bishop.) But if n&eacute;ede b&eacute;e (said the Pope) I permit the vse of flesh, so they pay me for it. So I (said the Bishop) suffer my people to eate bread if they will buy a licence of m&eacute;e. But bread (said the Pope is a creature ordai|ned by God for the sustenance of mans life; so (replied the Bishop) is flesh created of God for the benefite of men, yet you notwith|standing haue forbidden it. The Pope was now at the end of his roule, and for a conclu|sion added this. There is one thinge more, which indeed hath offended vs more then all the rest, which is, that when any of your subiects being grieued by your strange ordi|nance, doe flye vnto vs for succour and re|fuge, you confiscate all their goods, yea and put them to death also, if they fall into your hands. That also (said the Bishop) I learned of you Holy Father; for if any one oppressed by your intolerable imposito~s, haue recourse to God, hoping through faith only to ob|taine remission of his sinnes; you cause him to be burned, because he did not beg absolu|tion
<PB N="20" REF="15">
of the Priests and Monkes by you or|dained; accounting him an heritique, who puts all his trust in God onely through Iesus Christ his welbeloued sonne, our onely saui|our and aduorate. Well to conclude, the Pope would haue punished him, but that the Bishop shewed he could not doe it, but hee must much condemne himselfe thereby, and greatly derogate from his authority, for (said hee) s&eacute;eing I haue done nothing, but I did it as I was Pope, and by the authority which you haue giuen mee, if you punnish m&eacute;e, it will follow, that the Pope as hee is Pope may erre, and by consequence the Popdome will loose much of its credit and reputation. The Pope was aduised that hee spake the truth. Wherefore he commanded him to re|nounce his presentment to the Popdome, and to resigne his authority, which he would not do, aleadging that the Popdome was his, for he had well bought it, then the Pope offered to restore his thousand crownes, which hee paid for it: but the Bishop would not accept of them, both by reason of the great gaines he made thereof, as also for the great honour he receiued thereby. Finally, the Pope s&eacute;e|ing no remedy, did earnestly intreat him, that he would gouerne himselfe so wisely in
<PB N="21" REF="15">
his affaires, that no tumult or controuersie might thence arise&punc; and so after great feasting, with many kinde and friendly farewels, h&eacute;e sent him backe againe into his owne coun|trey.</P>

Peter</HI> was neuer at Rome, and therefore could not leaue the Popedome to the Bishops of Rome, which Iesus Christ (if men will belieue it) left vnto him: but another answered him, and said, if they haue no other reasons, they can neuer bring their enterprise to passe, for to ouerthrow the Popdome they must prooue, not that <HI>S. Peter</HI> was neuer at Rome, but ra|ther that the great Diuell of hell was neuer there: and then it will necessarily follow, that no Bishop of Rome was Pope, seeing
<PB N="22" REF="16">
that, not <HI>S.

Then one of them answering said, that when he erred it was as hee was man, and not as Pope; to whom the Pope replied thus: when we be|stow Bishoprickes, it is certaine that w&eacute;e doe it as Pope, and yet therein we often erre in conferring them on wicked persons, est&eacute;e|ming them to bee honest men.

<P>THe Emperor on a time demanded of Pope <HI>Paul,</HI> whether the same man might lawfully be both Pope and Emperor? The Pope fearing least that the Emperor (who was then without a wife) would make him|selfe Pope also, said that it could not bee, al|leadging many reasons for it, especially this, that a man could not at the same time well gouerne things spiritual, and temporall both. Then the Emperor said, and why then will you be both Pope and Emperor, and in signe thereof not onely vse the Miter as Pope, but also the Imperiall Diadem as Emperor? Leaue off therefore (as it is fit, the Domini|on, and gouernment of the temporall estate, and let it suffice you to be Pope: this if you will doe of your owne accord, I shall take it kindly, and inrich and exalt your kindred to great dignity; and the succeeding Popes shall be so weake, that they shall not bee able to hurt them; but if you will not doe it in

<P>A Cerretan, or seller of pardons, ariued at a citty, w^e authority to deliuer soules out of Purgatory, and many went vnto him to obtaine this deliuerance. Wherefore the Gouernour of the Citty communded him to shew his buls, and when he perceiued by them that he had all the power of the Pope, hee, demaunded of him how many soules hee could deliuer out of Purgatory? The <HI>Cerre|tan</HI> answered, that the power of the Pope (which he had) was infinite, and that by the same he could deliuer as many soules as were in Purgatory, although they were in num|ber infinite: and moreouer, that hee could preserue all from comming thither, which should at any time deserue to bee tormented there. Then the Gouernour said vnto him, for how many crownes wilt thou deliuer all the soules of those which either are dead or shhall hereafter die within my Iurisdiction? And b&eacute;e demaunded two hundred crownes, (contenting himselfe to gaine foure hundred by the bargaine, for the odde hundred he had

Then the <HI>Cerretan</HI> said, you are a very hereticke, who would thus limit the power of the Pope: tell mee I pray you is not God
<PB N="80" REF="44">
omnipotent? may not hee doe what hee will? can any one limit or bound the power of God? And the Legate answered no: so (repli|ed the <HI>Cerretan</HI>) in as much as the Pope hath all the power of God, as his Lieute|nant on earth, none can bound or restraine his power. But, said the Legate, wee read that out of hell there is no redemption, but that the paines thereof are eternall. Doe not you know (said the <HI>Cerretan</HI> that there is no rule so generall but hath some exception? that which you say is to bee vnderstood thus. That they cannot ordinarily bee deliuered thence: as heere in the prisons of <HI>Venice</HI> the malefactors kept therein cannot come out when ther will, notwithstanding the Signi|ory can set them at liberty when they please. But (said the Legate) what authority haue you ouer hell? The same (said hee) which the Pope hath ouer Purgatory; but I haue gained more by Hell then by Purgatory, and therefore if the Pope would follow my councell, hee might quickly fill his coffers with Treasure: the Legate asked him how? And hee saide, If hee would say that hee would deliuer Soules out of Hell; which might easily bee done, if (on|ly) in that place of his Bulles, where
<PB N="81" REF="44">
hee saith, Deliuer soules out of Purga|tory, hee would also adde deliuer Soules out of Hell. But the chiefe and principall matter of the businesse is, (said the Legate) not that h&eacute;e onely say so in wordes, but that they bee deliuered in d&eacute;ed and effect. What (said the <HI>Cerretan</HI>) neede the Pope care whether they be deliuered or no, so that the world doth bel&eacute;eue they are deliuered? Is it not sufficient for him, that h&eacute;e may fill his Chests with the gaine which hee reaps thereby? But (said the Legate) it is a ve|ry hard matter to make the world bel&eacute;eue that h&eacute;e can deliuer soules out of Hell: nay (said the <HI>Cerretan</HI>) so much hath h&eacute;e blinded and besotted the world that it is a very easie matter. Yea if you well consider it, you shall find that the Pope shall haue much lesse la|bour to perswade the poore world that he can deliuer Soules out of hell, then that he can fr&eacute;e them from Purgatory. For as touching Purgatory, h&eacute;e hath two labours, the first to make men understand that there is a Purga|tory; the second to make them bel&eacute;eue that he can deliuer Soules thence: but as touch|ing Hell, whereas euery one is already per|swaded that there is one, there remaineth but one labour for him, which is to make men

<PB N="86" REF="47">
that if they would haue it vnder heauen they could exalt it no higher. The other an|swered, that it was their parts not onely to preserue it, but also still to indeauour to aug|ment and exalt it: for as (said hee) wee who liue in this world, are but trauellers and possengers, neuer, during this life, attai|ning to the wished end of soueraigne perfec|tion, but aspiring dayly vnto it: so in like manner the Popedome is not yet come to the highest degree thereof. The Lutherans say that the holy spirit taught the Apostles all thinges necessary to saluation: but we hold on the contrary, that the same holy spirit doth day by day giue greater light vnto his Church, by reuealing new thinges vnto it: wherefore wee ought to hope that hee will reueale vnto vs some hidden secret which may serue much to the exaultation of the Popedome, Then one of the most ancient among them said, at the beginning they who came to visit the Bishop of Rome did kisse his mouth, as <HI>Iudas</HI> kissed Iesus Christ; but after hee was made Bishoppe of Bish|ops, they kissed his hand in token of grea|ter reuerence: after that beeing made equal to the Emperour, whereas hee was moun|ted higher, it was fit that they should kisse
<PB N="87" REF="47">
lower, and therefore they did kisse his kn&eacute;e: at length when hee was ascended aboue the Emperours, they began to kisse his foote (as they doe at this day) because it was the lowest and basest member of man: but as yet they kisse the vpper part, and not the sole of the foote, but now seeing that the Pope is exaulted not onely aboue the Emperour, but also aboue Iesus Christ himselfe, I think it fit that the Crosse which hee hath hereto|fore worne on the vpper part of his shooe, be hereafter placed on the sole thereof; and that all henceforth who will doe reuerence to the Pope, euen to the Emperour himselfe, bee compelled to kisse the bottome of his foote; which will bee a very great exaultation of the Popedome; for wee shall thereby plain|ly shew that the Pope is so highly aduan|ced in glory, that hee hath troad vnder his feete the Crosse of Iesus Christ, and all holy thinges. Hee had scarcely ended these words, before all the Bishoppes (lifting vp their hands towards heauen, and giue|ing praise to God for the reuelation of so great a secret) began to say, that although in that Councell they did determine of nothing else but that, and could profite the Church by no other meanes yet they thought

that they had well bestowed their cost and paines in comming togither. Wherefore in all hast they made it an article of faith.
