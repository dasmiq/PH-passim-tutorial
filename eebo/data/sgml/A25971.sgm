<HEAD>AN
ELEGY

Duchess of Ormond, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FOrbear, vain Muse, to vent thy Passion here,</L>
<L>Thou canst not offer one ingenuous Tear;</L>
<L>Nor mayst thou hope thy unregarded Verse</L>
<L>Can have admittance to this Sacred Herse.</L>
<L>Yet Silence here wou'd be Ingratitude,</L>
<L>'Tis then more pardonable to be rude.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If Men of Sense and Fancy more sublime</L>
<L>Condemn th' unpolish'd meanness of thy Rhime;</L>
<L>This just Excuse for that Disorder shew,</L>
<L>Tell them thy Thoughts are Discompos'd and Thou.</L>
<L>Less Mourners may Methodically weep,</L>
<L>Thy o're swoln Grief within no Bounds will keep.</L>
<L>Then venture to bewail thy rigid Fate,</L>
<L>And with the Saint departed thus expostulate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! Why so soon didst thou resign thy Breath,</L>
<L>And leave the World Impoverish'd by thy Death?</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3">Didst thou, to taste some Heavenly Bliss unknown,</L>
<L>Destroy our pleasure to increase thine own?</L>
<L>Ah no, thou knewst no such inferior Ends,</L>
<L>Thy nobler Aim still was t' oblige thy Friends;</L>
<L>For them thou hast thy Best Enjoyments given,</L>
<L>And might'st a while defer thy flight to Heav'n.</L>
<L>For no Bliss there to thee cou'd Foreign prove</L>
<L>Thy Conversation was so much Above</L>
<L>And thou enjoyd'st of Heav'n so large a store,</L>
<L>That Consummation scarce cou'd give thee more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy Love soard high, above all Human Aim,</L>
<L>Angels scarce boast a more Exalted Flame;</L>
<L>Scarce to their God more Frequent Homage pay,</L>
<L>Nor thou less Serious, less Devout than they;</L>
<L>On his Great Work thou didst thy time bestow,</L>
<L>In offering Pray'rs above, and doing Good below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor was the Case which did this Jewel hold,</L>
<L>Made of Course Earth cast in a Common Mold;</L>
<L>But suited to the Beauty of thy Mind,</L>
<L>Thy Body too was polish'd and refin'd.</L>
<L>Thy Face so Heav'nly, we believ'd it still</L>
<L>Not Human, till we found it passible.</L>
<L>Till Envious Time, to lessen our regard,</L>
<L>By stealth the lovely Frontispiece impair'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet Time design'd this Injury in vain,</L>
<L>Beauty amidst the Ruins did remain,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3">And taught us, by its Splendor in Decay,</L>
<L>To judge what its Perfection could display.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Heav'n displeas'd to see that Work abus'd</L>
<L>In forming which such Wondrous Skill was us'd,</L>
<L>As if the Artist chiefly had desir'd&punc;</L>
<L>To have his Pow'r in this Rare Piece admir'd,</L>
<L>Dissolv'd the Fabrick, to restore it so,</L>
<L>That it no Ruin, no Decay shall know.</L>
<L>But Lasting and Impregnable shall be</L>
<L>Not only against Time, but vast Eternity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! then forbear, mistaken Muse, in vain</L>
<L>In thy Hibernian Dialect to complain.</L>
<L>Demand no more why the Bright Soul is fled</L>
<L>And left our Joys, like her lov'd Body, dead:</L>
<L>But if thy Flight can track her through the Air,</L>
<L>Follow and see her great Reception there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Angels in Choirs croud the new Guest to meet,</L>
<L>And straw their Palms beneath her welcome Feet;</L>
<L>The meaner Orders plac'd on either hand</L>
<L>In double Ranks, to view, and guard her, Stand;</L>
<L>While Seraphims present a Robe of Light</L>
<L>Studded with Stars, and as the Sun-beams bright:</L>
<L>Now comes a noble Troop, in Heav'n well known,</L>
<L>A Troop of Works which she on Earth had done;</L>
<L>Of Pray'rs untold a very numerous Train;</L>
<L>For oft she us'd to pray, and ne'r in vain.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">Mortified Lusts, and Passions well subdu'd</L>
<L>Which ne'r till now durst to her Sight intrude</L>
<L>Repentant Sighs, and Tears in Bottles kept;</L>
<L>For Heaven exhal'd each precious drop she wept:</L>
<L>Besides a multitude of Virtues more,</L>
<L>Which loudly knock at the Eternal Door,</L>
<L>Make way, for <HI>Ormond</HI>'s Duchess comes, they cry,</L>
<L>And at the well-known name, the Locks straight open fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here wait those Saints to whom her Womb gave birth,</L>
<L>But coveted by Heav'n, soon snatch'd from Earth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! that among their number yet we see</L>
<L>The Good, the Great, the Glorious <HI>OSSORY!</HI></L>
<L>But he was brought to entertain Her here,</L>
<L>Lest, without Him, the Bliss imperfect shou'd appear.</L>
<L>Yet this great comfort he has left behind,</L>
<L>Th' exact Resemblance of his Generous Mind;</L>
<L>A Second <HI>OSSORY,</HI> whose blooming Youth</L>
<L>Gives early hope of a successful growth.</L>
<L>In whom th' admiring World does gladly see</L>
<L><HI>ORMOND</HI> and <HI>OSSORY</HI> in Epitome.</L>
<L>May he of <HI>ARRAN</HI>'s Virtue too partake,</L>
<L>Who wou'd not Honour for Applause forsake,</L>
<L>But bravely ventur'd to declare his Sense</L>
<L>In the behalf of injur'd Innocence;</L>
<L>Chusing to bear th' Aspersions of the Croud</L>
<L>Rather than stain his Soul with guiltless Blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> these Heroes Fame to celebrate,</L>
<L>And think on <HI>ORMOND</HI> the disconsolate;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4">That worthy Husband of this Virtuous Wife,</L>
<L>The noble part'ner of her Love and Life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He, like a Body, when <HI>Tormentors</HI> Art</L>
<L>Hath from the living Fibres torn the Heart,</L>
<L>Finds in himself no Signs of Life remain,</L>
<L>But the worst Symptome, a deep Sense of pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bring Lenitives to his excessive Grief;</L>
<L>And if thou findst they fail to give relief,</L>
<L>Tell him how dear a price 'tis like to cost,</L>
<L>Tell him&mdash;</L>
<L>His Master's Interest will in him be lost.</L>
<L>Tell him, his Life he to his Sov'reign owes,</L>
<L>And must not, but by his Command, expose:</L>
<L>These Reasons will affect his Loyal Sense,</L>
<L>For he was ever all Obedience;</L>
<L>To <HI>CHARLES</HI>'s Name he will due Rev'rence give,</L>
<L>And for his Service condescend to live.</L>
