<P>_IF any here
present in
this As|sembly,
(honou|red
<HI>Auditors)</HI> seeing hee
hath not heard what I
have formerly expound|ed
in <HI>Aristotles Rhetori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ques,</HI>
may perhaps mer|vaile
what moved mee,
who have taken upon me
<PB N="2" REF="9">
the <HI>Lectureship</HI> of the
<HI>Greek</HI> tongue&punc; to discourse
of <HI>Aristotles Summum Bo|num,</HI>
when the same par|ty
heares the <HI>Blessednesse</HI>
spoken of by <HI>Aristotle</HI> to
be now explaned by me,
and that it ought of neces|sity
bee taught, that yee
may both know how to
perswade aright, &amp; what
the proper end of good
things is, let him not dis|like
the reason that mo|ved
me, but let him attend
to the matter now in
handling. After hee per|ceives,
that it is the drift
of my discourse to shew
<HI>Aristotles</HI> e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">roneous opi|nion
<PB N="3" REF="9">
concerning <HI>Su~mum
Bonum,</HI> hee will (I feare
me) in his thoughts con|demne
my drift and pur|pose,
that I, but a young
man, should so transgresse
against the fashion of the
<HI>Vniversitie,</HI> as to cry
downe <HI>Aristotles</HI> credit.
But when he shall under|stand,
that I am enjoyned,
as I am a publike Teach|er,
to deliver sound and
true opinions, not errors
in the expounding of Au|thors,
I hope hee will not
censure mee too hardly.
Will hee demand what
reasons induced me to be
of a contrary opinion to
<PB N="4" REF="10">
most of <HI>Aristotles</HI> Inter|preters
now a days? Tru|ly,
if I have any judgment
at all, the vulgar and tri|viall
Expositors of <HI>Ari|stotle</HI>
do always, as much
as they can, and some|times
more then they
ought, adhere unto him in
their expositions. And e|ven
as the <HI>Romans</HI> did
highly extoll all <HI>Neroes</HI>
actions, yea his Villanies,
as sacred; in like manner
they, as it were appro|ving
al <HI>Aristotles</HI> sayings,
though never so false, doe
greatly applaud him. I be|ing
therfore very inquisi|tive
after the truth, when
<PB N="5" REF="10">
I had perused such writers
as were not so much in|clined
to <HI>Aristotle,</HI> I was
upon sundry good grou~ds
induced to believe, that <HI>A|ristotle</HI>
was greatly decei|ved.
For I did not onely
rest upon the opinions of
<HI>Ludovicus Vives,</HI> and
<HI>Peter Martyr</HI> (as some
malicious persons do ob|ject)
whose authority not|withstanding,
I doe, (as I
ought) much esteeme of;
but omitting others, who
have handled this point
before <HI>Vives</HI> and <HI>Martyr,</HI>
both <HI>Talaus</HI> &amp; <HI>Fox</HI> have
of set purpose lately con|futed
this <HI>Blessednesse of
<PB N="6" REF="11">
Aristotles.</HI> And those an|cient,
and excellent men
have long agoe so con+demned
it, that <HI>Gregorie
Nazi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> calls it con|temptible
and base&punc; <HI>Euse+bius</HI>

<HI>Ambrose, Augustine, Ori|gen,

any other&punc; ought to
be imbraced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> all autho+rities
in the World let no
man think it strange, that
<PB N="7" REF="11">
I had rather concuire in
opinion with such and so
great Clerks, then to hold
an errour with <HI>Aristotle.</HI> I
heartily wish, that this o|pinion
were well setled in
your minds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s both rea|son
and Religion doe re|quire;
that so, I might
have lesse trouble in spea|king,
and you lesse irke|somnesse
in heating those
things, which should be
as well pleasing, as they
are wont to be distastfull
unto you. But because this
conceit is so deeply roo|ted
in you, namely, that
<HI>Aristotles</HI> opinion, which
hath been approved and
<PB N="8" REF="12">
defended with the great
labour and pains of so ma|ny
learned Interpreters
cannot be shaken; I wish
you not sodainly to lay a|side
this conceit of yours,
although you see it so
strongly opposed by so
many, and so great autho|rities;
onely I crave, that
you wold not obstinately
prejudicate those things
which I shal speak against
it. I suppose, that such, as
are not obstinately bent
in defending <HI>Aristotle,</HI>
will grant, that so great
authorities have some
weight, but yet they will
deny, that <HI>Aristotles</HI> opi|nion
<PB N="9" REF="12">
can be co~futed with
any Arguments drawne
from his own Principles.
I will not complain, that I
am hardly dealt withall
by them, who will have
the question decided by
those Principles, which
being falsly framed have
caused this false opinion,
which I so dislike, especi|ally
when <HI>Aristotle</HI> him|selfe
useth first of all to
shake the opinio~s of those
Philosophers he contra|dicts
in the fundamentall
points, before he confutes
them; as we may observe
in <HI>Plato's Idea.</HI> But yet I
will accept of this condi|tion,
<PB N="10" REF="13">
to prove <HI>Aristotle</HI> to
be in a manifest errour by
his own Principles. But
because there are some o|ther
things, which for the
present doe more concern
us&punc; I intreat your patience,
that the handling of this
point may be deferred till
another time; for as the
husbandman, when hee
intends to til his ground,
that is overrunne with
briats and thornes, doth
first rid the ground of
them, that hee may the
more conveniently pro|ceed
in his tillage, &amp; sow
his seed; even so, before
your mindes can be setled
<PB N="11" REF="13">
in the true opinion of
<HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> some
distinctions, which, (like
thornes and briars) have
encumbred them, must be
removed; that so the see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of truth may take deeper
root, and spring up more
fruitfully.</P>
<P>For there is risen up in
this last age of the world,
a sort of men unknowne
to the Ancients, &amp; hated
of the Learned, who, not
out of any desire to si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t
out the truth, but to con|firme
their own perverse
opinions, would bee
thought of ignorant peo|ple,
in their rufflin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> dis|putes,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
to defend grosse
absurdities with their no
lesse absurd, and foolish
distinctions; in very deed
they doe expose them to
the judgement of all wise
men to bee laughed at.
There was one <HI>Callico</HI> (as
<HI>Eustathius</HI> reports) none
of the wisest, when hee
went to sleepe, used to lay
a brasse pot under his
head for a pillow; an hard
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">olster sure, but very fit
for his doltish pate; at the
last awaking, and not ve|ry
well pleased with his
hard pillow, hee filled the
pot with straw, to make it
softer; the pot certainly
<PB N="13" REF="14">
was not softer, but it was
enough for <HI>Callico,</HI> all the
while the fool perswaded
himselfe that it was softer.
After the same manner,
when we seek for case and
rest to our perplexed
mindes; certaine pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">try
<HI>Philosophers</HI> do put under
them this leaden <HI>Blessed|nesse</HI>
of <HI>Aristotles,</HI> &amp; when
they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mplain it is very
hard, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">y fill it with the
Chaffe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f Distinctions, &amp;
perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> they perswade
themselves, that it is sof|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er,
when neverthelesse, it
is a leaden lumpish <HI>Bles|sednesse</HI>
still. Whose bloc|kisnesse
is so much the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
more worthy blame, be|cause
that out of an obsti|nate
wilfulnesse of uphol|ding
<HI>Aristotle,</HI> they do so
labour to reconcile the o|pinions
of other Philoso|phers
dissenting in the
very judgement of <HI>Ari|stotle</HI>
himselfe, that even
as <HI>Proteus,</HI> sometime a
stone, by and by a stock,
anon fire, then again wa|ter.</P>
<Q>Omnia transformant se|se
in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">racula rerum.</Q>
<P>They change the~selves
to wo~derments of things.
So these men are some|times
<HI>Stoicks,</HI> by and by
<HI>Epicureans,</HI> anon <HI>Plato|nicks,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="15">
then again <HI>Aristip|pians,</HI>
and yet wholy <HI>Pe|ripateticks,</HI>
and so it see|meth
they would be all
things and nothing. <HI>Cice|ro</HI>
laughs at <HI>L. Gellius,</HI>
who, when he came <HI>Pro|consul</HI>
into <HI>Greece,</HI> called
together all the <HI>Philoso|phers</HI>
in <HI>Athens,</HI> and ex|horted
them earnestly to
leave off all wranglings,
and to spend no more
time in contentions,
which if they would
promise to doe, he promi|sed
likewise to hold with
them in opinion. But are
not <HI>Distinguishers</HI> like un+to
this <HI>Gellius?</HI> They see
<PB N="16" REF="16">
well enough, that Philo|sophers
do dissent in opi|nion?
and what then?
they, like pittifull men,
go about to reduce them
to an unity on equall con|ditions.
But, because an
unskilfull person does un|dertake
the businesse, it is
the more ridiculous; And
must the busines be quite
done &amp; finished, because
they make <HI>Aristotle</HI> the
Iudge? Wheras, if those
ancient Philosophers <HI>Pla|to,
Aristotle,</HI> and <HI>Tully</HI> did
but heare a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ter what man|ner
their own repugnant
opinions, are accorded
now adayes, it is to bee
<PB N="17" REF="16">
doubted whether they
would laugh or chafe at
it. But if you please let us
produce some one of these
<HI>Distinguishers,</HI> which can
defend the matter to their
faces. Whom will yee
have then, <HI>Buridanus,</HI> or
<HI>Bricottus?</HI> I know ye can|not
understand them, if
they spake. Whom ther|fore
wil ye have? whom?
<HI>Donatus Acci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iolus</HI> the
<HI>Florentine,</HI> both more e|loquent,
then the rest,
and better acquainted
with you; who, if hee
should appeare in place,
and behold these Philoso|phers
standing here with
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<HI>Cicero,</HI> he would perhaps
thus accoast them. Why
are yee thus in an uprore,
and perplexity, O yee
Philosophers? why are ye
thus distracted with seve|rall
opinions about <HI>Sum|mum
Bonum?</HI> What, do
yee not know, how that
all your jar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, and diffe|ring
opinions may easily
be reconciled by distin|guishing?
Have any of
you wrote any thing con|cerning
felicity or <HI>Sum|mum
Bonum,</HI> which (al|though
it be clean contra|ry
to all other opinions)
yet may not be accounted
true <HI>in his kinde?</HI> I lesse
<PB N="19" REF="17">
indeed wonder, that thou
O <HI>Cicero,</HI> doest not un|derstand
the Philoso|phers,
for thou hadst no
distinctions; Be not osten|ded
with mee, I say thou
wantest distinctions. O|therwise
why doest thou
teach in thy Books <HI>de Fi|nibus,</HI>
is in thy first Book,
that <HI>Epicurus</HI> placed <HI>Su~|mum
Bonum</HI> in v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">luptu|ousnes,
in the third Book;
that <HI>Zeno</HI> assigned it to
moral honesty; &amp; in thy
fifth Book, that <HI>Aristotle</HI>
placed <HI>Summum Bonum</HI>
in the comprehension &amp;
composition of all good
things internal, and ex|ternall;
<PB N="20" REF="18">
Why else didst
thou refute the first opi|nion
in the second Book,
and the second opinion
in thy fourth Book? Do|est
thou not understand
Distinctions, how, and in
what manner all these o|pinions
may bee true in
<HI>their kinde?</HI> For wheras
<HI>Epicurus</HI> resolves Volup|tuousnes
to be <HI>Summum
Bonum,</HI> hee means carnall
Felicity; <HI>Zeno</HI> Vertue; he
meanes Felicity simply;
And whereas <HI>Aristotle</HI>
ascribes <HI>Summum Bonum</HI>
to united, and compacted
good things, hee meanes
added, or associated Feli|city.
<PB N="21" REF="18">
Why didst thou <HI>Ci|cero</HI>
waste so much labour
about confuting <HI>Zeno's,</HI>

easily be accorded? But
(O <HI>Aristotle!)</HI> (whom I

<HI>Plato's Idaea,</HI> and to

Philosophers would

of all Philosophers the

that, whereon all other
good things depend, but
Blessednesse it selfe is
no where subsisting one|ly

For certaine it is
(although the <HI>Dunscotists</HI>

to speak finely, to pro|nounce

But heere I would not

will thus argue; therefore
these felicities are <HI>true in
their kinde.</HI> O wondrous

<P>But certainly the Schol|ler
must believe the Ma|ster,
for so says <HI>Aristotle;</HI>
And surely, he that teach|eth
must not lie, for so
sayes <HI>Aristotle</HI> also. If you
will observe <HI>Aristotles</HI>
law in teaching, unlesse I
keep the same also in lear|ning,
I shall transgresse.
But if you teach false do|ctrines,
which I ought
<PB N="41" REF="28">
not to believe; it is an ab|surd
part in you to co~pell
me to believe them. If you
would have men believe
what you teach, you must
teach those things, which
you ought to teach; if you
will not discharge your
duty in teaching, I will
not discharge mine in the
hearing; for oftentimes
the Teachers authority is
very prejudiciall to the
Scholers profit. Thus said
<HI>Cicero,</HI> I like not that <HI>Py|thagorean
ipse dixit</HI> in
mens resolutio~s. But they
that are bound must o|bey;
what must, if thy
commands be unjust? A
<PB N="42" REF="29">
Scholar must bee credu|lous;
if you teach false
doctrine? Hee that hath
twice suffered shipwrack
is but a fool to trust <HI>Nep|tune.</HI>
Wherefore if they
will be ruled by mee; let
them leave these poore
shifts, and sticke fast to
their surest refuge, as men
use to doe in dangerous
cases; namely, that they,
which speak against <HI>Ari|stotle,</HI>
doe not understand
<HI>Aristotles</HI> meaning. They
think, perhaps, that <HI>Ari|stotle</HI>
was a jugler, which
casts a mist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ore his
Readers eyes. Do not we
understa~d <HI>Aristotles</HI> mea+ning?
<PB N="43" REF="29">
O poore shift! So
<HI>Cicero</HI> reports of <HI>Torqua|tus,</HI>
who, when <HI>Epicurus</HI>
opinions were called in
question, said, that Philo|sophers
did not under|stand
<HI>Epicurus</HI> meaning.
Certaine <HI>Pythagoreans</HI>
said, that when the Hea|vens
are turned about,
they make an admirable
harmony, but men can|not
heare it. In like man|ner
<HI>Democritus</HI> said, that
his subtile moates were
dispersed thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ugh the
frame of the whole uni|verse,
but all men did not
perceive them. What
were <HI>Aristotles</HI> slaves able
<PB N="44" REF="30">
to understand him, and
shall not we be able? <HI>Dio</HI>
reports, that there is a cer|tain
cave at <HI>Hierap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lis</HI> in
<HI>Asia,</HI> whose vapours no
living creatures, saving
onely gelded men, are able
to endure. Is not <HI>Aristo|tles</HI>
stile like unto this
Cave, whose savo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r, none
but <HI>Eunne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> that is, such
as want the masculine li+berty
of judgement, and
are <HI>Aristotles</HI> slaves can a|bide?
it is even so. But
perhaps they are like to
that franticke fellow <HI>Ho+ratia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI>
who, the day
after the publique playes
were ended, would clap
<PB N="45" REF="30">
his hands in the Theater,
&amp; when his friends came
running, and demanded
the reason of his acclama|tions,
seeing that no bo|dy
acted; hee answered,
that hee saw Actours,
though they could not.
These men surely see
some strange things in <HI>A|ristotles</HI>
Theater, and doe
applaud them, which wee
cannot discern. But what
if I can shew, that they
themselves do not under|stand
him but being blin|ded
with a self-conceit of
<HI>Aristotles</HI> worth, as men
distempered with some
malady, doe with that
<PB N="46" REF="31">
franticke fellow imagine,
that they see that, which
they do not. And what if
I proove unto you that
<HI>Cicero, Diogenes, Laertius,</HI>
and <HI>Alexander Aphrodi|saeus</HI>
himselfe do interpret
<HI>Aristotle,</HI> as I do? What
if I shew those notable
Champions and Lights
of the Christian Church
both the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI>
Doctors, doe not onely so
expound, but also confute
<HI>Aristotle?</HI> What refuge
have they then? I know
not what answer they wil
make to <HI>Cicero, Laertius,</HI>
and <HI>Alexander;</HI> unlesse
perhaps they will say
<PB N="47" REF="31">
that credit is not to be gi|ven
to examples; at least
wise, that the places cited,
are but probable, not true.
And mee thinkes I smell
what they will say of
Christian Writers. They
wil not (except I be much
mistaken) deny, that those
things, which so worthy
men have wrote against
<HI>Aristotle</HI> are true, and yet
they will deny that <HI>Ari|stotle</HI>
cried. How then can
it be possible, that in this
very point they write tru+ly
that <HI>Aristotle</HI> erred, &amp;
yet (say they) <HI>Aristotle</HI>
erred not? You shall
heare: there is a twofold
<PB N="48" REF="32">
<HI>Truth;</HI> a <HI>Philosophicall
Truth,</HI> and a <HI>Theologicall
Truth. Aristotle</HI> was in an
error according to a <HI>The|ologicall
Truth,</HI> and in that
sense he is blame worthy;
but <HI>Aristotle</HI> erred not in
a <HI>Philosophicall Truth,</HI> for
in that sense hee could not
bee mistaken without
doubt, for hee is a miracle
of Nature. What is this I
heare? A <HI>Philosophicall
Truth?</HI> and a <HI>Theologicall
Truth?</HI> This is pulling in
pieces, not distinguishing.
Now indeed, I nothing
marvell at those men, who
use to scoffe and deride
the <HI>simple Truth,</HI> when
<PB N="49" REF="32">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> can
hatch two <HI>Truths</HI> for
one; as drunken men use
to see two Lanthorns for
one; and <HI>Plautinus</HI> found
two Masters for one <HI>Mes+seinus,</HI>
and mad <HI>Pentheus</HI>
beheld two <HI>Suns</HI> for one.
They have so well profi|ted
in the Art of wrang|ling,
that they have quite
forgotten how to dispute.
For what is <HI>Truth?</HI> The
Learned in the <HI>Greeke</HI>
Tongue doe call <HI>Verum</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign"> of the Verbe <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
esse</HI> to be, because it is the
same, which it is said to
be. Therefore as Philoso|phers
teach, that Contra|ries
<PB N="50" REF="33">
cannot stand together
at one, and the same time
in the same subject; so the
same Philosophers teach,
that contradictories can|not
both be true of one
and the same thing. Is it
not then a shame for our
<HI>Logicians</HI> to disable, and
enervate the very first
Principles of <HI>Logicke?</HI>
For wheras <HI>Aristotle</HI> doth
teach, that to affirme and
deny the same thing not
onely in the generall, but
also in the particular must
needs be co~tradictorious;
these men do in very deed
deny this truth; albeit
they oppose a frivolous
<PB N="51" REF="33">
distinction (like a Cloud
against the Sunne, to ob|scure
the truth. <HI>Aristotles</HI>
felicity is not true felicity,
this they grant to be true
in Divinity; again <HI>Aristo|tles</HI>
felicity is true felicity;
this they will have to be
true in Philosophy. O sil|ly
<HI>Epiphanius,</HI> who didst
reck on the errours of Phi|losophers
amongst Here|sies!
O simple <HI>Iustin Mar|tyr,</HI>
to confute <HI>Aristotles</HI>
opinions in so great a Vo+lume!
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d not they (silly
men) know how to argue
ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ers in a phil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sophi+call
truth, when they em|brace
a divine truth? But
<PB N="52" REF="34">
&ocirc; thou Apostle, <HI>Paul</HI> I
am sorry for thee! why
doest thou dispute with
the <HI>Stoicks</HI> &amp; <HI>Epicureans</HI>
at <HI>Athens,</HI> of the resurre|ction
of the dead, and the
life to come? It needs no
controversie at all. For al|though
all Philosophers
doe flatly deny the resur|rection
of the body, yet
it is in a philosophicall
truth; but thou <HI>Paul</HI> dost
affirme it in a <HI>Theologicall
truth,</HI> as thou hadst lear|ned
of <HI>Christ.</HI> But why
dost thou dissent from all
Philosophers to no pur|pose?
Why doest thou
not permit the <HI>Athenians</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="34">
to believe Philosophers?
Doest thou thinke they
will the more hardly be|come
Christians for that?
It is not reasonable to al|low
<HI>Eusebius</HI> the benefit
of this distinction; For he
was in an error. He knew
not this twofold truth.
Hee sayes <HI>Aristotle</HI> doth
impugne, and gainsay the
Scriptures, in that hee did
ascribe felicity to the ex|ternall
welfare of the bo|dy
in that hee said that
Gods Providence exten|ded
not to every subluna|ry
thing; in that hee said
the World was eternall,
not created, and that the
<PB N="54" REF="35">
soule of man was not e|ternall
but mortall. <HI>Euse|bius</HI>
affirmes, that in all
these points <HI>Aristotles</HI> o|pinions
are flat against
the Scriptures. Thou art
mistaken <HI>Eusebius! Ari|stotle</HI>
doth not thwart the
Scriptures. Thou must
learne to distinguish be|tweene
a <HI>Philosophicall
Truth,</HI> and a <HI>Theologicall
Truth.</HI> Come hither <HI>Am|brose,</HI>
come <HI>Augustine,</HI>
come all the rest of <HI>Do|ctors,</HI>
and learne of our
<HI>Philosophers,</HI> that there is
one Truth in Divinity, &amp;
another Truth in Philo|sophy.
They do Philoso|phers
<PB N="55" REF="35">
much wrong. <HI>Plu|tarch</HI>
reports, how that
one bid a Painters boy
who had painted a Cock
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l-favouredly to chase a|way
all right Cocks from
his picture. Those men
that doe alienate divine
Truth, doe the very same
thing. Yet if these men
had bin Painters, I doubt
not, but they would have
distinguished, that they
had painted well accor|ding
to the truth of the
Picture, though not ac|cording
to the truth of
the Cocks nature. But as
<HI>Tiridates</HI> King of <HI>Arme|nia</HI>
called that wicked
<PB N="56" REF="36">
Wretch <HI>Nero</HI> his God;
So <HI>Aristotles</HI> Patrons, do
ascribe the name of Truth
to the vaine Opinion of
Philosophy. Which if it
be once granted, what can
be so absurd, but it may
be defended, or what so
false, but it may be pro|ved,
either with an <HI>Epicu|rean,
Platonicall, Stoicall,</HI>
or <HI>Turkish</HI> Truth; or with
a Papisticall, or Hereticall
Truth; to co~clude, which
way not? And in this
manner, as <HI>Democritus</HI>
not satisfied with the opi|nion
of one World, drea|med
of infinite Worlds;
so we not contented with
<PB N="57" REF="36">
one truth, shall conceive
innumerable truths of
our owne braine. But this
will be the issue of all at
last in despight of Philo|sophers,
that as <HI>Varro</HI>
reckons up 30000 Gods
amongst the <HI>Gentiles,</HI>
when indeed there was
but one onely; even so,
when they have forged
30000 Truths, they shall
finde but one only, and
that is the simple Truth,
which they so deride.
Here before I proceed a+ny
further, lest these
things perhaps exami|ned,
which I have allea|ged
(and I very gladly
<PB N="58" REF="37">
desire they may be) are
not to be found in <HI>Euse|bius,</HI>
which I have cited
out of <HI>Eusebius;</HI> yee shall
understand, that they are
not to be found in the <HI>La|tine
Eusebius. Trapezun|tius,</HI>
who was <HI>Aristotles</HI>
great friend, translated
<HI>Eusebius</HI> his Books <HI>de Eu|angelica
praeparatione</HI>
into the Latine tongue.
Fourteene of his Books,
which contain a consuta|tion
of Heathens and
Philosophers, <HI>Trapezun|tius</HI>
translated into Latin,
but as for his fifteenth
Booke, which <HI>Eusebius</HI>
wrote almost altogether
<PB N="59" REF="37">
against <HI>Aristotles</HI> errours,
as concerning mans Feli|city,
the Worlds Fterni|ty,
the Providence of
God, and the Souls Mor|tality,
<HI>Trapezuntius</HI> ne+ver
medled with that.
Therefore lest any man,
being deceived with the
Table of the Booke, doe
traduce me, ye shall know
that Latine <HI>Eusebius de
Evangelica praeparatione</HI>
wants the fifteenth Book,
in which are co~tained the
things by me alleaged If
any will look for it, hee
may finde it in the <HI>Greeke</HI>
Copy. Study therfore the
<HI>Greek</HI> tongue, that ye may
be able to discern the craf|tinesse
<PB N="60" REF="38">
of Interpreters,
which is too frequent in
prophane writings, but
chiefly in the Scriptures.
What <HI>Eusebius</HI> thought
fit to write for the advan|tage
of the <HI>Christia~ faith,
Trapezuntius</HI> thought
not fit to be expounded,
because it weakned <HI>Ari|stotles</HI>
credit. How much
worse then hee, are our
men in these dayes, who,
fearing lest they should
savour too much of Chri|stianity,
desire to heare
young Striplings speake
finely, and to defend by
arguments, points repug|nant
to godlines; but are
loth to hear those things,
<PB N="61" REF="38">
which are consonant to

love Piety, they love Re|ligion,
So, I think, as the

certain witnesses, so fresh

doubtlesse they have been

<HI>Bishops</HI> at least, for num|ber

hee may see this more at

when the Professors of

had prevailed thus

by <HI>Aristotle</HI> the soule to

Lords field by that conta|gious
Contriver of all mis|chiefe,
and amongst the

is mortall; which whosoe|ver
shall affirme, to be
true, are taxed by that
<PB N="107" REF="61">
Councell for rash and

And no more but so?
yea, they are all con|demned,

say according to Divini|ty;
nay, but they are con|demned,
whosoever doe
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ouch it to be true even

Heare the generall

that every assertion con|trary

And wee doe decree,
that all persons, who doe

this errour, are to be taken

But now (lest they might

which are contrary

both by doctrine and ex|hortation
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">root out, and con|fute

Thus ye have the Decree,
the curse is denounced a|gainst
all t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e violaters
therof. And this Decree
<PB N="111" REF="63">
was not ratified by a few,

onely worshipfull Master

it seems, more favouring
<HI>Aristotle,</HI> then Piety, said
that the second part of
the Decree did not please
him, wherin it was enjoy|ned
that Philosophers
should openly teach, and

I omit the pressing
of this point in the <HI>Ny|cene</HI>

appointed for that
purpose; They held it a
great abuse, and a matter
of dangerous co~sequence
for Philosophers to
broach impieties in pub|lique

<PB N="114" REF="65">

all others, whether they

<HI>the Truth is conquerer;</HI>
They themselves totter,

the <HI>Truth will triumph</HI>

<PB N="117" REF="66">
and by how much
the more forcibly it is

The Sun ofttimes
is darkned, but that dark|nesse
is discussed. <HI>Proser|pines

But if any <HI>Novice</HI>

Words are but winde,

And so I doe hear|tily
againe, and againe
intreat the <HI>Aristotelians,</HI>
if they have any confi|de~ce
in their cause, if they
beare any true affection

<PB N="119" REF="67">
that they will confute
mine opinions. If they
cannot doe it (for I doubt
not of their good will to

yield to the truth. Let
them not object, they are
not suffered to speak their
minds openly, they have
place enough to write
their mindes, and that
they may do more freely,
and upon better delibera|tion.
I acknowledge
mine own weaknesse, no
man more, but strong is
the Truth. I doe not so
much distrust my selfe, as
I trust to my Cause. A

<PB N="120" REF="68">
a good cause; but <HI>Cicero</HI>

But I would wish them
to provide new distincti|ons;
for these, which I

oftner boyled, than the

not twice, but a

the stomack of <HI>Polyphe|mus</HI>
himself is not able to
disgest, so that it is no
mervaile our Schollers
are sicke so often, when
they are crammed with
such distinctions. If any
more sober minded hath
either not understood, or

There are some in

so it may be as truly

The Physician must bear

how bitter grudgings I

did I know to bee spent
upon these trifles of
mine, I should be very
stupid, if I should not e|steeme
them as matters of
great importance, both
for your benefit, true pie|ties
sake, and Gods glory,
which (the Lord is my
witnesse) I onely aime at.
These may seeme light
<PB N="125" REF="70">
matters, but the trees vi|gour
consists in the root.
The Scriptures and pro|fane

bee referred to pious

minde of that good old

whose Image is every day
before our eys; This one|ly
was his chiefest care.
And howsoever hee fell
into the error of the times,
yet all his care was, that
Religion, Piety, and god|ly
Exercises should flou|rish
and increase daily a|mongst
us. Who, seeing
hee hath left behind the
<PB N="127" REF="71">
expression of this his
good desire rather in the
Statutes of the house, than
in our behaviour (which
is to be lamented) there|fore
hee seemes to speake
to us all continually, as a
father to his children in
this manner.</P>
<P>Wheras I did heartily
desire you young men, my
sonnes by adoption, and
brethren in Christ, to be
brought up in the know|ledge
of God, which is
true blessednesse; lest the
thorny cares of the world
should choake the spring|ing
seeds of godlinesse in
you, I built an house for
<PB N="128" REF="72">
you, that so you being
freed from carking cares,
might wholy apply your
studies. I provided nou|rishment
for your bodies,
and soules. I admonished
you to be mindfull, that
your place assigned you
on earth was not perma|nent,
but transitory, and
that you have here no a|biding
City, but must
look after one in Heaven.
I have ordained for you
Professors of the tongues,
and Arts, that so you at|taining
to the knowledge
of them in your younger
yeeres, might be enabled
to underrgoe weighty af|faires
<PB N="109" REF="72">
hereafter. I besee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ched
you in the bowels of
<HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> that you
would devote all your
studies to Gods glory. I
have declared to the
World, that this College
of mine was founded for
Divinitie sake. I have en|joyned
the other Lectu|rers
to designe all their
labours, and studies to ac|commodate
the Divine.
I have earnestly exhorted,
and enjoyned you all to
strive, and contend with
all possible diligence for
the knowledge of Divi|nitie.
I had good hope,
that this Colledge would
<PB N="130" REF="73">
have sent forth many
both excellently learned
men, and sound Christi|ans,
who being well sea|soned
themselves with
heavenly wisdom, would
make the unsavory minds
of others to relish pietie,
bring the light of the
Gospell to them that sit
in darknesse, restore the
sick to health, refresh the
poore, strengthen the
weak, direct them that go
astray, and raise up the
dead by the Gospell. But
alasse my hopes are fru|strate;
my labours are all
in vaine; yea, so short of
arriving at the desired ha|ven,
<PB N="129" REF="73">
that they are over|whelmed
with a tempest
in the very mid-way.
That <HI>Origen,</HI> when he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

the Heathens at <HI>Alexan|dri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI>
had such good suc|cesse
in teaching of Rhe|torique,

that many of them were
converted to Christiani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ty.
I trust, Christians are
not made impious by
your Expositions of Mo|rall
Philosophy in <HI>Ox|ford;</HI>
but I am sure you
corrupt weake Schollers
with your <HI>Epicurean</HI> li|centiousnesse
<PB N="130" REF="74">
of life. Thus
the streams, which should
refresh the dry soules of
poore wretches, that the
plants of piety might
spring apace, are quite
dried up in the very foun|tain;
so the fruit is perish|ed
in the blossome, the
Corne is crushed in the
blade, before it can come
to a true ripenesse, and be
