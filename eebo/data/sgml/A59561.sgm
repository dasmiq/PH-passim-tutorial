<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>GAL. V. xiii.</BIBL>
<Q>Vse not liberty for an occasion to the
flesh.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ANY one that useth to make reflections
upon his own actions, cannot but ob|serve,
That one of the great occasions
of the sins he is guilty of in the course of his
Life, is the too free use of his lawful <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>I do not say, that any Man doth commit
sin by using his <HI>lawful liberty</HI> (for that would be
a kind of contradiction): But I say, the using
our <HI>liberty</HI> to the utmost pitch and extent of
<PB N="2" REF="3">
that which we call <HI>lawful,</HI> is the occasion of a
great many sins that would otherwise not have
been committed.</P>
<P>If one should offer to tempt a Man that
hath any sense of Vertue or Religion; to do a
thing, that at the first sight appears sinful or
wicked; it would certainly be rejected. E|very
one that has any regard to God or good|ness,
would start at such a proposal. But here
is our infelicity. A Temptation comes on by
degrees. And at the first we are ingaged in
nothing but what is lawful and honest; and
accordingly we use that <HI>liberty</HI> which <HI>nature</HI> and
<HI>religion</HI> allows us; and so we proceed on insen|sibly
in the use of that <HI>liberty,</HI> till at last we
become uncertain, whether we have not ex|ceeded
the bounds of what is <HI>lawful:</HI> And by
this means we are often caught. Nay indeed
nothing but this could betray well meaning
persons, and such as are vertuously disposed,
into sin. <HI>Licitis perimus omnes,</HI> said a devout
Man: It is by <HI>lawful things</HI> that we commonly
miscarry.</P>
<P>With great reason therefore doth St. <HI>Paul</HI>
give this advice in the Text: <HI>Brethren</HI> (saith
he) <HI>ye have been called unto liberty, only use not li|berty
for an occasion to the flesh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3">
There is no doubt but the Apostle writ these
words upon occasion of, and with reference
to, the great Controversy that was then on
foot among Christians, touching the Obliga|tion
of the Jewish Law.</P>
<P>Some then thought themselves bound in
Conscience to observe all the Precepts of <HI>Moses</HI>
his Law. Other Christians thought they were
freed by the coming of Christ from all <HI>legal</HI>
Observances. The Apostle determines the
Case in favour of these latter, and declares,
that by the Gospel <HI>they were called unto liberty,</HI>
and were free from all the Mosaical Impositi|ons.
But yet nevertheless he tells them they
ought to be careful in the exercise of that <HI>li|berty;</HI>
that they <HI>do not use it for an occasion to
the flesh.</HI></P>
<P>That is to say, that this <HI>liberty</HI> to which they
were <HI>called,</HI> should not minister to any sin.
That they should not so use it, as to be a snare,
either to <HI>themselves</HI> or <HI>others.</HI> To <HI>themselves,</HI> by
running into licentiousness, and taking <HI>unlaw|ful
liberties.</HI> To <HI>others,</HI> either by affrighting the
unbelieving Jews from the embracing Christi|anity,
or discouraging those that already belie|ved
the Gospel in the profession of it.</P>
<P>This is the strict sense of the Apostles words,
<PB N="4" REF="4">
as they come in here in the Text, and as they
do relate to that occasion upon which he writ
them. But, that sense, with reference to that
occasion, is now out of doors among us.
Though the general advice that is here given,
will eternally be good and useful; nay, and
always needful to be insisted on in all Ages of
the World.</P>
<P>We have none now <HI>that use their liberty for an
occasion to the flesh,</HI> as to the point of the <HI>Iudaical
Ceremonies:</HI> But we have abundance that do
use it so as to other matters. Nay, as I said
before, this too free use of our <HI>liberty</HI> in <HI>lawful
things,</HI> is one of the great Sources and Foun|tains
from whence most of our irregularities
do proceed. And therefore I do not know
how I can entertain you more usefully upon
this Text, than by endeavouring to give you
the best Rules I can, for the reducing the Apo|stle's
Exhortation into practice, as it doth con|cern
us at this day.</P>
<P>But that you may see plainly what I drive
at, I will yet state the matter a little more par|ticularly.</P>
<P>Our Case in this World is this. The Laws
of <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> do allow Men all <HI>rea|sonable
liberties</HI> in the gratification of their natu|ral
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Passions and Appetites, and in the use and
enjoyment of all the good things of this Life.
But all <HI>unreasonable</HI> gratifications, all <HI>excesses</HI>
and <HI>immoderate liberties,</HI> are forbidden by <HI>Reli|gion,</HI>
and therefore are <HI>sinful</HI> and <HI>criminal.</HI></P>
<P>If now in all Cases a Man could readily and
certainly fix the precise <HI>bounds</HI> and <HI>landmarks</HI> of
what is <HI>reasonable</HI> and <HI>moderate,</HI> and what is <HI>un|reasonable</HI>
and <HI>excessive</HI> in the use of his <HI>liberty&punc;</HI>
so as that upon all occasions, and in all emer|gencies,
he could say within his own mind,
<HI>Thus far I may lawfully and innocently go in the gra|tification
of such an appetite, or in the enjoyment of
such a pleasure,</HI> or the like; <HI>but if I proceed a step
further, I become a Transgressor:</HI> I say, if this
was the case of a Man in the <HI>use</HI> of his <HI>liberty,</HI>
it would be no hard matter for any well dispo|sed
person, to take all that <HI>liberty</HI> that was <HI>mo|derate</HI>
and <HI>lawful,</HI> and to forbear all that which
is <HI>excessive</HI> and <HI>unlawful.</HI></P>
<P>But now this is not always an easy matter
to be done. For many Cases happen in which
a Man cannot precisely determine where it is
that his <HI>lawful liberty</HI> ends, and where it is that
it begins to be <HI>extravagant</HI> and <HI>excessive.</HI> So
that while a Man is only designing to gratify
his desires in lawful instances, he is often car|ried
<PB N="6" REF="5">
beyond his bounds, and proceeds to <HI>ex|cess.</HI></P>
<P>This now, I say, is one great occasion of
sin to Mankind; and yet there is no avoiding
of it, because it is such a one as doth necessa|rily
arise from the nature of things.</P>
<P>Thus for instance: It is certainly very law|ful
for a Man to drink Wine and strong drink,
not only for his Healths sake, when his Con|stitution
doth require it; but also for Chear|fulness,
and the enjoyment of his Friends. But
on the other side, <HI>Drunkenness</HI> and <HI>Intemperance,</HI>
are grievous Crimes, and utterly forbid by our
Religion. Whilst now a Man on one hand
hath a desire to take that liberty that is allow|ed
him, and to gratify his natural inclination
to <HI>mirth</HI> and <HI>pleasantness,</HI> or to shew <HI>Civility,</HI> as
he terms it, to his Company: And on the
other hand, he has no certain unalterable mea|sures
to proceed by, for the stinting himself in
this Case; (as surely it is a very hard matter to
prescribe or define, either to a Man's self or
others, the exact pitch or limits where <HI>Tempe|rance</HI>
ends, and <HI>Intemperance</HI> begins): by this
means, I say, he is often betrayed into sin.
Thinking with himself, that there is a great
<HI>latitude</HI> and <HI>compass</HI> in the exercise of <HI>Temperance</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
and <HI>Sobriety</HI> (as indeed there is,) and that
therefore he may go on some time longer
with the Company; the Wine by this means
steals upon him, and he is, before he was
aware, fallen into the sin of <HI>Intemperance</HI> and
<HI>Excess.</HI></P>
<P>And thus it is, not only as to the <HI>use</HI> of our
liberty in things allowed, but as to the per|formance
of our <HI>duty</HI> in things <HI>commanded.</HI></P>
<P>Every Man is sensible, that it is a principal
Law of our Religion to be <HI>Charitable,</HI> and to
give Alms out of our substance. But now it
is not so easy a matter for any Man to define,
and set out the <HI>quantum,</HI> or the precise propor|tion
of Alms, which every one is bound to
give; so as to be able to pronounce, that if a
Man give so much, he performs his duty, and
is a <HI>Charitable</HI> Man, for one in his Circumstan|ces;
but if he gives less than that, he is <HI>Cove|tous</HI>
and <HI>Uncharitable.</HI> Now, I say, because
this duty of <HI>Charity</HI> is thus indefinitely left, and
there is such an <HI>affinity</HI> and <HI>undistinguishableness</HI>
between the least measures of <HI>Charity,</HI> and the
sin of being <HI>uncharitable;</HI> Men do from hence
often take occasion to fall short in the perform|ance
of it. And as in the former instance I
gave about <HI>drinking,</HI> they are apt to take more
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<HI>liberty</HI> than is <HI>allowed</HI> them; so in this they are
apt to do less than is <HI>commanded</HI> them. For if
they do but give something to the poor out of
their yearly Income, they think they give e|nough
to satisfy the Command of <HI>Charity;</HI> and
so they make no Conscience of <HI>saving</HI> and <HI>hoard|ing</HI>
without end or without measure.</P>
<P>There are a hundred more instances besides
these two that I have named, wherein there
is such a <HI>latitude</HI> left to our practices, and the
difference between <HI>lawful</HI> and <HI>unlawful: duty</HI>
and <HI>sin</HI> lies in so small a compass, that it is
hard to separate and distinguish them, unless
a Man be both very wise and very honest.</P>
<P>We have not any Law of God which de|fines
how often we are to <HI>pray;</HI> Or when it is
our duty to <HI>fast;</HI> Or to what degree we may
be <HI>angry;</HI> Or how we are to govern our selves
as to the quantity or kinds of our <HI>meat</HI> and
<HI>drink;</HI> Or how far we may comply with the
<HI>Customs</HI> of the World; Or how splendid we
may be in our <HI>apparel</HI> and <HI>equippage:</HI> Or what
<HI>games</HI> and <HI>recreations</HI> may be used, and how
often; Or what Rules we are to go by in <HI>buy|ing</HI>
and <HI>selling,</HI> and our other dealings with
Men; Or how far we may seek our own,
when our right cannot be obtained without
prejudice to our Neighbour.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="6">
In these, I say, and abundance of other Ca|ses,
we have no express particular Laws of God
to steer and measure our actions by; nor in|deed
is it possible we should have: Because
what is fit and reasonable to be done in these
Cases, admits of so great a difference from the
infinite variety of the circumstances of parti|cular
Men.</P>
<P>What now must we do in these Cases?
How must we order our selves, that we may
perform our duty, and keep out of sin?</P>
<P>Why in answer to this I say, We have on|ly
general rules to direct us in these matters;
and those rules we are to apply to our own
particular cases.</P>
<P>In this <HI>latitude</HI> that things are left in, we are
to use our <HI>liberty</HI> as carefully and as prudently
as is possible; taking our measures from the
principles of <HI>reason,</HI> and the general rules of
the <HI>Gospel.</HI> Now what those general rules and
measures are, it is my business at this time to
treat of.</P>
<P>And <HI>three</HI> things I have here to propose for
the <HI>use</HI> of our <HI>liberty,</HI> which will, I think, be
a sufficient direction to us in all cases of this
nature; and which if we do carefully observe,
we shall never <HI>use our liberty for an occasion to the
<PB N="10" REF="7">
Flesh;</HI> but we shall both come up to what is
our duty, and shall likewise avoid all those
sins which Mankind are so frequently betrayed
into, through the too great affinity that there
is between <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Vice,</HI> and the indiscreet
exercise of their <HI>liberty</HI> upon occasion thereof.</P>
<P>And the <HI>first</HI> thing I would possess you all
with, and which indeed, as it is the most ge|neral,
so it is the best advice that can be given
in this matter, is this: <HI>That we would endeavour
to be heartily honest and serious in the business of Re|ligion:</HI>
That we would sincerely devote our
selves to the service of God: That we would
purify our minds as much as may be from all
sensual and selfish Principles; and in all our
actions and pursuits, have more respect to the
doing our duty, and the approving our selves
to our great Lord and Master, than to any o|ther
consideration.</P>
<P><HI>This is that which St.</HI> Paul <HI>so often exhorts
us to.</HI> Whether <HI>(saith he)</HI> you eat or drink, or
whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God. <HI>And
again,</HI> Whatever ye do, do it heartily as unto the Lord,
knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward
of the inheritance.</P>
<P>If we could once get our selves possessed of
this <HI>Probity,</HI> this <HI>Purity</HI> of mind and heart, it
<PB N="11" REF="7">
would better instruct us in the <HI>use</HI> of our <HI>liberty,</HI>
and teach us to distinguish between <HI>good</HI> and
<HI>evil;</HI> what is fit to be done, and what ought
not to be done, in all cases and emergencies
we are concerned in; than all the dry Rules
of <HI>Casuistical</HI> learning, be they never so care|fully
and accurately laid down.</P>
<P>When a Man is once arrived to that holy
temper of mind, that he heartily loves God
and his Neighbour, and has such a lively sense
of the truth and the excellency of Christ's Reli|gion;
that he is resolved, that that shall in|fluence
and govern the whole course of his
Life, and that he will do all his actions, as
much as he can, for the honour of our Lord,
and the advancement of his service in the
World: There can hardly any particular
case occur to such a Man in which he will not
have rules and measures ready at hand to steer
and direct him in his proceedings.</P>
<P>Nay this general Principle alone <HI>of doing all
his actions to the glory of God,</HI> that is to say, to
the honour of his Religion, and the edification
of his Neighbour: I say this alone will afford
him sufficient light and direction for the go|vernment
of his actions in all Contingencies.
Because there is no action he can be ingaged
<PB N="12" REF="8">
in, but it is at the first sight discernable, whe|ther
the doing of it, or the not doing of it,
doth more tend to the honour of his Religion,
or the good of others.</P>
<P>That which makes the conduct of a Man's
self in this World, so nice and difficult a mat|ter,
and has given occasion to the discussion of
so many cases of Conscience about the <HI>lawful|ness</HI>
or <HI>unlawfulness</HI> of Actions, is this; That
Men are not throughly <HI>honest,</HI> but halt between
God and the World. They have a great
mind to <HI>serve</HI> their <HI>pleasures</HI> and their <HI>ambition,</HI>
and their secular ends; and yet to <HI>serve God</HI> too,
and this puts them upon <HI>tampering</HI> and trying
to reconcile these interests together.</P>
<P>Whence it comes to pass, that the usual
questions that arise about their actions, are
not, what is best to be done, or what is most
agreeable to their duty in this or the other case?
But, how far they may go in the gratification
of such an appetite or passion, without trans|gressing
the Laws of God? How far they
may satisfy their <HI>covetous</HI> desires, without be|ing
<HI>unjust?</HI> Whether they may use such <HI>arts</HI> or
<HI>tricks,</HI> in getting or saving, without being
<HI>knavish?</HI> How far they may <HI>drink,</HI> and not be
<HI>drunk?</HI> How far they may gratify their hu|mour
<PB N="13" REF="8">
of <HI>decking</HI> and <HI>adorning</HI> themselves, and
yet do no unlawful thing? How far they may
indulge <HI>wantonness,</HI> and yet be <HI>chast?</HI></P>
<P>Now, as I said before, such Questions as
these are not easy to be resolved (nor indeed is
the Gospel of Christ so contrived, as if it had
taken much care whether they were resolved
or no.) But they are really Cases and Problems
that require both Judgment and Learning,
and likewise the consideration of abundance of
particular circumstances, to have a good ac|count
given of them.</P>
<P>But now the Man that doth intirely give up
himself to the conduct of the Spirit, and pro|poseth
nothing to himself in all his actions but
the pure Glory of God: Such a Man having
none of these Worldly sensual designs to serve
in his actions, can rarely be supposed to have
any of these questions to put to himself. And
consequently he can never be at a loss or un|certainty,
how he is to act for want of a reso|lution
of them, much less can he be in danger
of transgressing the bounds that God hath fixed
to his Actions.</P>
<P>All the point that such a one hath to consi|der
in any action is, whether will his doing or
not doing such an action better serve the ends
<PB N="14" REF="9">
of Religion? Which will tend most to his own
spiritual benefit, and the profit of his Neigh|bour,
to pursue this design, or to let it alone?
Whether will be more conducive to the ho|nour
of his Lord, to gratify such an appetite,
or to deny it satisfaction?</P>
<P>This I say is the only question that such a
Man has to put to himself, and there is no dif|ficulty
in giving an answer to it. For there is
scarce any case to be put concerning an action,
but it is very obvious, without an instructer,
to find out which side of the case, if it be cho|sen,
will most minister to the ends of <HI>Vertue,</HI>
and <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Charity.</HI> Or if it be not obvi|ous,
then it is very certain, the Man needs not
much deliberate about it, but may chuse either
side indifferently.</P>
<P>It is a very hard matter oftentimes to deter|mine
concerning the <HI>necessity</HI> and <HI>obligation</HI> of
Actions; that is, whether a Man be <HI>bound</HI> to
do them or no. It is likewise often a hard
matter to determine concerning the <HI>lawfulness</HI>
of Actions, whether a Man <HI>may</HI> do them or
no. But it is a very easy matter in most cases
to determine, concerning the <HI>expedience</HI> of
Actions; that is to say, whether it be <HI>best</HI> and
<HI>fittest</HI> for a Man to do them or no. Now this
<PB N="15" REF="9">
last, I say, is the point that a throughly good
Man will consider and steer himself by in all
his Actions.</P>
<P>Thus for instance, It may perhaps bear a
dispute, Whether a Man be precisely bound
by God's Law, to <HI>pray</HI> solemnly twice a day,
so as that he sins if he do not: But it will bear
no dispute, that it is much better, and more
acceptable to God, and beneficial to our
selves, to pray at least thus often, than to pray
seldomer. And therefore such a person as I
am speaking of, will upon this consideration
put it in practice (nay and <HI>pray</HI> oftner too as
he has occasion) without concerning himself
whether he be strictly bound so to do or no.</P>
<P>It may bear a dispute among some Persons,
whether <HI>painting</HI> the <HI>Face</HI> be not allowable to
Christian Women. But it can bear no dispute
among any, that it is more agreeable to the
Sobriety, and Modesty and Chastity, of a Di|sciple
of Jesus Christ, and better serves the
ends of Religion to forbear all such suspicious
Ornaments. (There being rarely any good
end to be served by them, but abundance of
evil often arising from them.) Now this con|deration
alone is enough to set the heart of eve|ry
serious Christian against those practices, and
<PB N="16" REF="10">
to make them wholly to refrain them.</P>
<P>Thus again, it is argued both ways about
<HI>Play</HI> or <HI>Gaming,</HI> whether it be lawful or no:
(especially when sums of money are played
for; and the thing becomes rather an <HI>avaritious</HI>
Contention, than a <HI>Recreation</HI> and <HI>Divertise|ment</HI>)
some believing that it is innocent; o|thers
that it is a grievous sin. But there is no
Man, even of those that use it most, but will
readily acknowledge, that it exposeth a Man
to great and dangerous <HI>Temptations</HI> of sundry
kinds; that it is the occasion of abundance of
<HI>sin,</HI> and abundance of <HI>mischief;</HI> and that it sel|dom
fails to produce intolerable consequen|ces,
both as to Mens <HI>Souls,</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> and
<HI>Families.</HI> Now to a Man that loves God, and
hath a tender sense of his duty, this is enough
in all Conscience to deter him for ever from
the practice of <HI>Gaming,</HI> though it be not made
to appear to him, that it is <HI>expresly</HI> and <HI>expli|citly</HI>
forbid by any Law of <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>So that you see, that in those points where
there are disputes on both sides, when the con|sideration
is concerning the <HI>obligation,</HI> or the
<HI>lawfulness</HI> of an action; there is no difficulty,
no dispute at all, when the consideration is
only concerning what is <HI>best</HI> and most <HI>fitting</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="10">
to be done; concerning what is most agree|able
to our duty, and most conducive to the
honour of God and Religion, as to that action.
That is evident enough in all Cases; nor is
any Man at a loss for finding it out. And that
is the Principle which I say every sincere lover
of God, governs himself by; and which I
would have us all to propose to our selves for
the rule of our actions, in order to the securing
us from those <HI>snares</HI> and <HI>stumbling-blocks,</HI> to
which the <HI>affinity</HI> between <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Vice, law|ful</HI>
and <HI>unlawful,</HI> will otherwise expose us.</P>
<P>Let us not stand upon points with God Al|mighty,
as if so much was his, and so much
was our own; as if we were to share our
selves between his Service, and our own Plea|sures
and Profits, and the like; and were re|solved
not to pay him any more respect or
love, than what some express letter of his Law
doth exact at our hands. But let us so entirely
devote our selves to his Service, as to do not
only all those things which we are strictly
bound to do, or else we are transgressors; but
all those things that are acceptable to him, all
those things that are praise-worthy, and tend
to the perfection of our nature, and the repu|tation
of Christ's Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="11">Let us make it the end of our actions, not
to seek our selves, but his glory; every day to
grow better and better, and in every Occur|rence
to consider, not what may <HI>lawfully</HI> be
done, but what is most <HI>becoming</HI> a <HI>Disciple</HI> of
<HI>Iesus Christ</HI> to do. In a word, what ever is
<HI>best</HI> in any action; what ever most serves the
ends of <HI>piety;</HI> what ever tends most to the cre|dit
of our Religion, and the benefit of others,
let us consider that, and act accordingly.</P>
<P>And thus I am sure to design and act, is
most suitable to the nature and genius of our
Christian Religion; nay indeed, it is the prin|cipal
Law and Commandment of it.</P>
<P>The design of Christianity is not to adjust
the precise bounds of <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Vice, lawful</HI>
and <HI>unlawful,</HI> which is that that a great many
among us so greedily hanker after. For the
best that could have come from such a design,
had been only this, that Men by this means
might have been fairly instructed, how they
might have avoided the being <HI>bad;</HI> though
they never became very <HI>good.</HI> But the design
of Christianity, is to make Men as <HI>good</HI> as they
can possibly be; as <HI>devout,</HI> as <HI>humble,</HI> as <HI>chari|table,</HI>
as <HI>temperate,</HI> as <HI>contented,</HI> as <HI>heavenly-min|ded,</HI>
as their natures will allow of in this World.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="11">
And for the producing this effect; the exact
distinguishing the <HI>limits</HI> of the several <HI>Vertues,</HI>
and their opposite <HI>Vices,</HI> signifies very little.</P>
<P>The Laws of our great Master are not like
the <HI>Civil, Municipal</HI> Laws of Kingdoms, which
are therefore wonderfully nice and critical,
and particular in setting bounds to the practi|ces
of Men, because they only look at <HI>overt
actions;</HI> so that if a Man do but keep his <HI>actions</HI>
within the compass of the <HI>letter</HI> of the Law, he
may be accounted a good Subject, and is no
way obnoxious to the <HI>penalties</HI> which the Law
threatens.</P>
<P>If our Religion had been of this strain, we
should without doubt have had a World of
particular Laws and Precepts, and directions
about our actions, in all emergent Cases, more
than we now have: And we might as easily
have known from the <HI>Bible,</HI> what was <HI>forbidden
unlawful anger,</HI> what was <HI>excessive drinking,</HI> what
was <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>luxury</HI> in <HI>Apparel,</HI> and the like;
as we now know by the <HI>Statute-Book,</HI> what is
<HI>Burglary,</HI> or <HI>Murder,</HI> or <HI>Treason.</HI> But there
was no need of these particularities in the in|stitution
of Christ Jesus. His Religion was to
be a Spiritual thing: And the design of it was
not to make us <HI>chast,</HI> or <HI>temperate,</HI> or <HI>humble,</HI> or
<PB N="20" REF="12">
<HI>charitable,</HI> in such a degree; but to make us as
<HI>chast</HI> and <HI>temperate,</HI> as <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>charitable,</HI> as
<HI>pure</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> in all our Conversation, as we
possibly can be.</P>
<P>This I say was the design of Christ's Reli|gion.
It was to be the Highest <HI>Philosophy</HI> that
was ever taught to Mankind. It was to make
us the most excellent and perfect Creatures, as
to <HI>purity</HI> of <HI>mind</HI> and <HI>heart,</HI> that humane nature
is capable of. And therefore it hath not been
so accurate and particular in prescribing bounds
to our <HI>outward actions,</HI> because it was abundant|ly
enough for the securing them, to oblige us
to the highest degree of <HI>inward purity.</HI></P>
<P>And this it hath done above all the Laws
and Religions in the World. It teacheth us to
abhor every thing that is evil or impure in all
the <HI>kinds</HI> of it, in all the <HI>degrees</HI> of it, and in all
the <HI>tendencies</HI> towards it; And to lay out our
selves in the pursuit of every thing that is <HI>honest,</HI>
that is <HI>lovely,</HI> that is <HI>praise-worthy,</HI> and of <HI>good
report</HI> among Men.</P>
<P>If this now be the design of our Religion,
and these be the Laws of it, I leave it to <HI>you</HI>
to judge of these two things. <HI>First,</HI> Whether
it doth not highly concern all of us that pro|fess
this holy Religion, to endeavour, in all
<PB N="21" REF="12">
our Conversation, to be as holy and as vertu|ous
as we can, and to do as much good as we
can; and not to content our selves with such
a degree of <HI>honesty</HI> and <HI>vertue,</HI> as is just suffici|ent
to the rendering us <HI>not vicious.</HI> And then
<HI>secondly,</HI> Whether, if we do thus endeavour,
we can easily be at a loss in distinguishing be|tween
<HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil, duty</HI> and <HI>sin,</HI> in any instance;
And consequently, Whether we can be much
in danger of ill <HI>using</HI> our <HI>liberty,</HI> and so trans|gressing
upon that account.</P>
<P>I have been longer upon this first head than
I intended, but I shall make amends for it, by
dispatching the two following, in so much the
fewer words. And indeed after so large an
account as I have given of the general Rule,
there is less need of dwelling upon particular
ones.</P>
<P>II. In the <HI>second</HI> place, In order to the <HI>right
use of our liberty,</HI> and so securing our selves from
falling into sin, through mistaking the mea|sures
of <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil;</HI> This will be a good
rule to propose to our selves, namely, <HI>That in
matters of</HI> Duty, <HI>we should rather do too much than
too little: But in matters of</HI> Indifferency, <HI>we
should rather take too little of our liberty than too
much.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="13">
<HI>First,</HI> As to matters of <HI>Duty</HI> my meaning
is this: That where the Laws of God have
generally and indefinitely commanded a thing,
but have not set down rules about the parti|cular
measures and proportions of it; in that
case it is advisable rather to do more than we
are perhaps precisely bound to do, that so we
may be sure we have performed our duty;
than by being scanty in our obedience, to run
the hazard of falling short of our duty.</P>
<P>Thus for instance, Our Lord in the New
Testament, hath often and solemnly com|manded
us to <HI>pray.</HI> But neither he nor his
Apostles, have any where told us how <HI>often</HI>
we are to <HI>pray;</HI> only they have bid us pray
frequently. In this Case now a Man that
makes a Conscience of performing his duty,
will take all occasions and opportunities of lift|ing
up holy hands, and devout affections to
his heavenly Father: However, he will not
fail, at least <HI>once</HI> every time he riseth, and <HI>once</HI>
every time he goes to rest, to offer up a <HI>solemn</HI>
Sacrifice of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise.</HI> Less than this, I
say, he must not do, for fear he break the
Commandment of praying <HI>frequently,</HI> praying
<HI>continually.</HI> But more than this it will become
him to do, in order to the giving himself sa|tisfaction,
<PB N="23" REF="13">
that he hath fully performed it.</P>
<P>Thus again, <HI>To give alms to the poor,</HI> is an in|dispensable
Duty of our Religion. But what
proportion of our substance we are to give
away in <HI>Alms</HI> and Charity, is no where set
down; but is wholly left to our <HI>discretion.</HI>
Now in this case, it is certainly much more
advisable to give <HI>liberally,</HI> and <HI>largely,</HI> and <HI>plen|tifully;</HI>
even as much as our condition in this
World, and the necessities of our Families can
allow: though by so doing, we should prove
to have given in greater abundance than we
were strictly obliged to: Than by giving <HI>stin|gily</HI>
and <HI>pinchingly,</HI> now and then a little <HI>pocket
money</HI> or so, to run the hazard of being Trans|gressors
of the Commandment, and having
our Portion among the <HI>covetous</HI> and <HI>unmerci|ful.</HI></P>
<P>There is no <HI>damage</HI> comes to a Man by do|ing
the former; but on the contrary, a great
deal of <HI>good.</HI> For God never fails <HI>bounteously</HI> to
reward the <HI>bountiful</HI> hand. But there is both
<HI>damage</HI> and infinite <HI>danger</HI> in the latter. And
thus we are to practise in all other Duties.</P>
<P>Only this caution we must take along with
us: That we are always so to proportion the
measures of every single duty, as to render it
<PB N="24" REF="14">
consistent with the performance of the other
duties of our lives.</P>
<P>As for instance, we must not spend so much
time in <HI>Prayer,</HI> as to hinder the pursuit of our
<HI>Callings,</HI> and necessary business. We must so
<HI>give Alms,</HI> as yet to leave our selves enough to
pay every one their own, and to make a com|petent
provision for our Families. But let us
but take care to secure this, and then we can|not
easily exceed in the measures of any duty.
The more we <HI>pray,</HI> and the more we <HI>give alms,</HI>
still the better. And so in all other instances
of duty.</P>
<P>But now in the <HI>second</HI> place, the quite con|trary
to this are we to practise in matters of <HI>li|berty.</HI>
There the rule is, rather to take <HI>less</HI>
than is allowed us, than to take <HI>all.</HI> Rather
to abridge our selves of our lawful <HI>liberties,</HI> than
by doing all that we may lawfully do, indan|ger
our falling into sin.</P>
<P>There is no harm at all in departing from
our Rights and Priviledges which God hath
indulged us: But there is a great harm in ex|tending
them beyond their bounds. There
is no evil in not gratifying our desires and ap|petites
in all the things they crave, which are
allowable, and which we are permitted to gra|tify
<PB N="25" REF="14">
them in: But there is an infinite evil in
gratifying them in unlawful forbidden instan|ces.
And therefore every wise and good Man
will be sure to keep on the safe side; and to
prevent the danger of doing more than he
should do, he will not always do all that he
may do.</P>
<P>The truth is, that Man that makes no scru|ple
of <HI>using</HI> his <HI>liberty</HI> to the utmost stretch and
extent of it upon all occasions, and regards
nothing more in his actions, than just that he
do not fall into some direct sin: That Man
cannot always be innocent, but will be drawn
into a hundred irregularities and miscarria|ges.</P>
<P>Thus for Example, he that useth himself to
<HI>eat</HI> or to <HI>drink</HI> to the utmost pitch that can be
said to be within the limits of <HI>Temperance,</HI> it is
impossible but such a one will now and then
be unavoidably overtaken in the sin of <HI>Gluttony</HI>
or <HI>Drunkenness.</HI></P>
<P>He that will use all the <HI>liberties</HI> that the Law
allows him, for the making <HI>advantages</HI> to him|self
in his <HI>Trade,</HI> or his dealings with other
Men: Such a one will not be able to avoid
the just imputation of being in many instances
an <HI>Oppressor,</HI> or a <HI>hard Conscienced</HI> Man.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="15">
The safest way therefore if we mean to pre|serve
our Vertue amidst the multitude of snares
and Temptations that we meet with in the
World, is to set bounds even to our <HI>lawful li|berties;</HI>
to keep our actions within such a com|pass,
as not to come even near the <HI>Confines</HI> of
<HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Though it is but a <HI>point,</HI> and that often an
undiscernable one, that distinguisheth between
what is <HI>lawful,</HI> and what is <HI>unlawful.</HI> Yet there
is a great <HI>latitude</HI> in what is <HI>lawful.</HI> That is, if
I gratify my Appetites but a little, I do that
which is <HI>lawful;</HI> and if I gratify them more, I
may do that which is <HI>lawful</HI> likewise. But he
shews the most honest and vertuous Mind, that
in his actions takes but a little of this <HI>Latitude,</HI>
and by that means keeps himself at a good
distance from that which is <HI>vitious</HI> and <HI>cri|minal.</HI></P>
<P>III. But <HI>thirdly</HI> and lastly, To what de|gree
soever we may think fit to make use of
our liberty; yet at all times, <HI>Assoon as we begin
to doubt or fear we have gone as far as we lawfully
can go; it is then high time to break off, and to pro|ceed
no further.</HI> This is the last Rule I have to
offer upon this occasion. And thus also, where|ever
we have a just ground of <HI>suspicion</HI> or <HI>doubt,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="15">
whether a thing be <HI>lawful</HI> or no; this <HI>doubt</HI> or
<HI>suspicion,</HI> is of it self reason enough to make us
forbear that thing. Unless indeed there be a
<HI>Necessity,</HI> or a great <HI>Charity</HI> to be served by the
doing of it, which may in reason over-balance
the <HI>suspicion</HI> of its lawfulness.</P>
<P>Thus in matters of <HI>Recreation.</HI> If we have
the least doubt, whether this or the other <HI>Plea|sure</HI>
or <HI>Divertisement</HI> be <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>lawful;</HI> why,
that is Argument enough, without more ado,
to make us <HI>forbear</HI> it; though perhaps we see
others use it without scruple.</P>
<P>Thus in matters of <HI>Temperance,</HI> when we first
begin to suspect that we have <HI>drunk</HI> as much as
is convenient for us: Let us by all means leave
off, and break from the Company.</P>
<P>Thus in matters of <HI>Sobriety,</HI> when we have
reason to doubt, that we are come up to the
full bounds of the Christian <HI>gravity</HI> and <HI>modesty;</HI>
and that any degree more of <HI>pomp</HI> or <HI>bravery</HI> in
our <HI>garb,</HI> or in our <HI>attendance,</HI> or in our <HI>Equi|page,</HI>
will relish of Pride, or Vanity, or Affecta|tion:
It is high time rather to abate some|thing
of our <HI>sumptuousness</HI> in these things, than
to proceed any further.</P>
<P>And thus lastly in matters of <HI>Equity</HI> and <HI>Iustice,</HI>
when we first begin to have a <HI>suspicion,</HI> that
<PB N="28" REF="16">
such a practice is an <HI>indirect</HI> or <HI>knavish</HI> trick, or
that we are too <HI>severe</HI> and <HI>hard</HI> upon a Man,
upon whom we have got an advantage: Why
this <HI>suspicion</HI> alone is enough in reason to check
us in our cariere, and to put us upon more fair
and moderate courses.</P>
<P>This is a Rule that will for ever be fit for us
to practise, for it is grounded upon Eternal
Reason. Indeed it is as old as <HI>Morality. Quod
dubitas ne feceris.</HI> Do nothing that you doubt
of, is a Maxim that obtain'd among the Hea|thens
as well as among us Christians.</P>
<P>I dare not indeed say, that this Rule holds
universally, in all Cases. For Cases do some|times
happen, wherein it will be advisable for
a Man to act even against his doubts. But in
such matters as I am now speaking of, matters
wherein a Man is at perfect liberty to act or
not to act: In all such Cases, it will always,
without exception, be a true, and a safe, and
a wise Rule. And I am sure, if Men would
seriously charge themselves with the practice of
it, they would hereby prevent a multitude, of
Sins and Transgressions, with which they usu|ally
<HI>inflame</HI> their <HI>Accounts</HI> against the Day of
Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="16">
And thus much of the <HI>Rules</HI> I had to pro|pose,
as to the <HI>use of our Liberty,</HI> in such cases
where a Man is at a loss in finding out the
measures and bounds of <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>sin,</HI> and upon
that account is in danger of Transgressing. I
have only <HI>two</HI> things more to add upon this Ar|gument,
by way of <HI>Application,</HI> and I have done.
The one as a <HI>Caution</HI> to prevent the misapplying
these Rules; the other as an <HI>encouragement</HI> to
put them in practice.</P>
<P>That which I have to say by way of <HI>caution</HI>
is this: That what I have been now recom|mending,
especially under the two last heads,
is not intended to be a rule or direction to any
<HI>Hypochondriack,</HI> or Melancholy Persons, or such
as are apt to be <HI>over-scrupulous</HI> about their acti|ons:
For indeed to such persons it is the worst
advice that can be given.</P>
<P>For they are apt to doubt and boggle at eve|ry
thing, be it never so innocent and free from
blame. They dare not eat a hearty meal for
fear of being <HI>Intemperate.</HI> And for fear of not
being <HI>devout</HI> enough, they exhaust their Spirits,
and spoil their health, through the continual
<HI>intention</HI> of their minds to serious things.</P>
<P>Now Persons that are of this temper, are
rather to be encouraged to take more <HI>liberties</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="17">
than they do; than to abate any that they
make use of.</P>
<P>But their case is of another consideration,
and foreign to my present purpose; and there|fore
I here say no more about it. It being suffi|cient
to have given this intimation to such peo|ple,
that they do not make an ill use of any
thing that I have now represented; for assu|redly,
what hath been now said, doth not
much concern them.</P>
<P>2. The other thing I have to say, and
that by way of <HI>Encouragement,</HI> is this: I doubt
not but some will be apt to think, that the
Rules I have now given about the <HI>exercise of our
liberty,</HI> are much too strict and severe; and
that if they must be tied up to such measures,
then farewel all the <HI>joy</HI> and <HI>pleasure,</HI> and <HI>comfort</HI>
of their lives. But to such People I would
crave leave to say, that they have very wrong
notions of this matter.</P>
<P>The using of their <HI>liberty</HI> in such a manner as
I have been recommending, would not rob
them of one true <HI>pleasure</HI> or <HI>comfort</HI> that this
World affords. So far from that, that I am
very sure, whoever frames his life according to
these measures, shall live a hundred times a
happier Life, and shall enjoy the World and
<PB N="31" REF="17">
all the <HI>pleasures</HI> and <HI>advantages</HI> of it, much more
to his own content and satisfaction; than if he
put no check to the craving of his Appetites,
but always indulged and gratified them in eve|ry
thing, and as much as they desired.</P>
<P>Assure your selves, Vertue and Religion will
never hinder you from enjoying any pleasure
or satisfaction that is natural. On the contrary
there is great reason to believe, that the pra|ctice
thereof will extreamly heighten and ad|vance
the satisfactions you can receive from
your Worldly Enjoyments. I doubt not in the
least, but to a sincerely pious and vertuous
Man, and that hath a regard to God in all his
actions, even the very pleasures and comfotts
of this Life are more gratifying and affecting,
than to any sensual or wicked Man. For such
a one, as he is more capable of enjoying them,
so do they come to him likewise without the
mixtures of those uneasy, troublesome, bitter
reflections, that other Men feel in the very
best of their Enjoyments.</P>
<P>Let no Man therefore apprehend any loss of
his pleasures by entirely devoting himself to
God's Service, and <HI>using his liberty</HI> in that care|ful
way I have been recommending. Let him
not think that he shall hereby be too much
<PB N="32" REF="18">
<HI>straitned</HI> and <HI>confined.</HI> For certainly this is the
true means, not only to keep him for ever from
being a Slave to any thing, but also mightily to
improve and encrease his <HI>liberty.</HI></P>
<P>For by thus exercising himself, all the pow|ers
of his Soul will be vastly inlarged, and he
will hereby attain both <HI>leisure</HI> and <HI>will</HI> to em|ploy
all his rational Faculties about the best
and the noblest objects in the World, which
will yield him the greatest pleasure that is to
be had on this side Heaven. Whereas if he
had given up himself to be govern'd by any of
his sensual Appetites, he had been a <HI>poor nar|row
confined</HI> Creature indeed; not capable of
any greater satisfactions or pleasures, than
what the Brutes do enjoy as well as himself,
but with less uneasiness, and fewer distur|bances.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, a sensual Man hath no
notion of this kind of pleasures, no more than
a <HI>Beast</HI> hath of the pleasures of a <HI>Man.</HI> And
therefore it is no wonder that such Men enter|tain
all talk about them as little better than
meer <HI>Cant</HI> and <HI>Iargon.</HI> But I seriously appeal
to all Men that have ever made any trials in
the way of Religion and Vertue, whether the
Contentments and satisfactions they have re|ceived
<PB N="33" REF="18">
from the rational use of their <HI>liberty,</HI> and
the thoughts and reflections that hereby they
do approve themselves to God, and live in
hopes of his Favour, and have a fair prospect
of a glorious Immortal State in another World:
I say, whether they do not find the pleasures
and contentments that arise from hence, to be
infinitely more solid, and substantial, and du|rable,
than any of those that they receive from
the gratification of their sensual Appetites in a
vitious unreasonable manner.</P>
<P>Oh therefore, Let none of us make any scru|ple
of devoting our selves entirely, and with|out
reserve, to God Almighty's Service. Let
none of us be afraid to put reasonable restraints
upon our Passions and Appetites. Assuredly
the thus <HI>using our liberty,</HI> is the certain way to
preserve and encrease it, and with it, the plea|sure
and comfort of our Lives; and not only
so, but to render us Everlastingly Happy and
Blessed in the other World. Which that we
may all be, <HI>God of his infinite mercy grant,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
