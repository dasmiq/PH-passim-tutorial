<P>Now I beseech thee (gentle Reader) what man is there, whome either the feare of Gods iustice doth withdraw from vice and sin, or yet doth induce and bring in minde to reforme and amende his life? wherin thou mayest iustly lament, and bewaile the folly &amp; state of men, and much wonder at their blindnesse, or rather mad|nesse, which in such shortnesse &amp; vncertainty of life do so behaue themselues, that they haue no mind of any reformation, or ame~d|ment of our life, when we bee croked for olde age, and haue then fearsely one day to liue: far off is it, that we go about, or inte~d that thing, when we be yonkers, and in our flourishing age.

Ca. 15.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2.43.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4. 1. Thes 17.</NOTE> First is vnbeliefe: for if we supposed not, that those things were fables, which are mentioned in the scriptures euery where of the last day of iudgement, and of the voyce of the Archangell, and of the trump of God, and of the throne of Gods seate, wherat al m&eacute; must stand, of the punishment of the wicked, of the euerlasting and blessed life, which the godly after this miserable life shal enjoy, of the resurrection of the bodies &amp; soules, eyther to be partakers to|gither of certaine ioye, or else of certaine paine, and also shall giue his accompt of al things, which he hath done, either intended, by thought, saide, or done, and how he hath vsed gods giftes and crea|tures, towards his needy members, &amp;c. VVithout al doubt &amp; que|stion they would not liue thus ydlely &amp; naughtily as they do.</P>
<P>The second cause is, the boldnesse (to sinne) vpon gods mercie: this boldnesse is great in very deede, but yet it is such as they may well ynough deceiue the~selues withal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 5.6. Ezech. 18.322 1. Pet. 3.9. Rom. 2.4.</NOTE> For of boldnesse they haue no sure trial at al. So Salomon saith, say not, the mercie of God is great: he wil forgiue me my manifold sinnes: for mercy and wrath came from him, and his indignation commeth downe vpon sin|ners. &amp;c. with this boldnesse I say, the wicked enimie of mankinde kepeth man in sinne continually, but like as god graunteth forgi|uenesse at the first to the repentaunt: so doeth he also sharply pu|nish those sinners which do continue obstinately (without repen|tance) in vice and sin. For such men then, as repent not vnfainedly, and purpose to leade newe liues, conceiue a false hope and bolde|nesse of the mercie of God. And by this meanes that the Diuell setteth forth to men this boldnesse, he bringeth this to passe, that they liue on forth quietly, and securely in vice and wickednesse, and thinke little or nothing with themselues at any time of anye reformation or amendment. And herein they despise the aboun|dance and riches of the bountifulnesse &amp; long suffering of god, being ignoraunt, that the goodnesse of god doth induce, and lead vnto repentaunce.</P>
<P>The third cause is, the custome of sinne, which is in a manner,
<PB REF="5">
made naturall in long continuance. For like as it is harde for a ma~ to alter nature:<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVisdo. 14.19. Levit. 18.30. Iereme. 13.23. Ecclesi. 4.12.12.</NOTE> so custome, if it be once rooted, cannot easily bee plucked vp and expelled. And therefore it is that learned men doe cal custome an other nature. It is as a certaine wiseman saith: such vices as we haue accustomed our selues to, from our tender age, cannot be without great difficultie weeded out afterward, whiche thing though it be very certaine and true, yet who seeth not how fondly fathers and mothers bring vp their children in cockering,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe. 6.4. Eccle. 30.7.9.</NOTE> and pampering them: from their infancie they bee giuen to none other thing, but to pride, delicious fare, and vaine idle pleasures and pastimes.</P>
<P>VVhat prodigious apparel, what vndece~t behauiour, what boa|sting, bragging, quarelling and ietting vp and down, what quassing, feasting, ryoting, playing, dauncing and dicesing, with other lyke felowship that is among them&punc; it is a wonder to see.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 30.11.12.13.</NOTE> And the pa|rents can hereat reioyce and laugh with them, and giue libertye to their children to doe what they liste, neuer endeuouring to tame and salue their wilde appetites. VVhat marueyle is it, if they bee found thus naughtie and vicious, when they come to their full yeares, and mans state, which haue of children bene trayned and entred with suche vice&punc; whereof they wil alwayes taste,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horatius.</NOTE> as <HI>Horace</HI> saith, <HI>Quod nouatesta capit, inueterata sapit.</HI>

<L>With which it was first seasoned, and thereof smelful strong:</L>
<L>Euen so a child, if that he be in tender yeares brought vp</L>
<L>In Vertues schoole, and nurtred wel, wil smel of Vertues cup.</L></Q></P>
<P>If these men therfore at any time do fully purpose to repent the and reforme their liuing: as when their conscience moueth them, or the burthen of their sinne pricketh them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 5.7.</NOTE> yet custome hath so preuailed in them, that they fal into worse and worse enormities, and like mad men desire the reformation of their life.</P>

VVhat other thing but this, is the cause that there be now so many adul|terers, vnchast and lewde persons and ydle Rogues? That we haue such plentie of Dicers, Carders, Mummers &amp; Dauncers&punc; And that such-wickednesse and filthy liuers are spred about in euery quar|ter, but only naughty education and bringing vp: wel then, suche as impute this thing to the newe learning and preaching of the gospel are shamefully deceiued, hauing no iudgement to iudge of things No, no, the newe learning and preaching of the Gospell is not the cause hereof, but the naughty, wanton and foolish brin|ging vp of children by their parents, as I haue declared.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 14.23. Deut. 21 18 19.20.21.</NOTE>Also the slacknesse and vnreadinesse of the Magistrates to doe and execute their office, is a great cause of this: if they that vse ta|uernes, playing, and walking vp and downe the streates, in time of a Sermon: if disobedient children, to their parents. If Dicers Mu~|mers, ydellers, dronkerds, swearers, Rogues &amp; Dauncers, and such as haue spent and made away their liuing in belly cheare and vn|thriftinesse were streightly punished, surely ther shuld be lesse oc|casion giuen to offend, &amp; also good men should not haue so great cause to complain of the maners of men of this Age. Therfore the magistrate must reme~ber his office: For he beareth not his sworde for naught, for he is gods minister and a father of the cou~trey ap|pointed of god, to punish offenders: but nowadayes by reason of libertie without punishmente, and slackenesse of men in office, which wink at their faults, causeth so many idle players &amp; dau~cers to come to the Gallows as there are, for as the wise man saith, who so prohibiteth not men so to offend when he may, in a maner co~|maundeth them so to do:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 12.13.14.</NOTE> for it is better to be a subiect to a magi|strate vnder whom nothing is lawfull, than vnder him, to whome al things is lawful. I feareme gretly therfore, least the heathen m&eacute;s seueritie, and streightnesse in punishing vice, shal be a reproch to our magistrars, and accuse them at the last day for their negligence
<PB REF="6">
and slacknesse herein. It is not inough to punish sinne only, but al|so to preuent and take away the causes thereof.</P>
<P>The fourth cause is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 12.15.</NOTE> Securitie in wealth and prosperitie, which doth inebriate the mindes of men in suche sort, that they neyther remember God, nor constantlye purpose to reforme and amende their liues. Therfore it was wel sayd of one, that like as of prospe|ritie riot proceedeth: Euen so of riot co~meth both other co~mon vi|ces, and also vngodlynesse, and the neglecting of Gods word and commaundements: And as <HI>Seneca</HI> af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">meth, that into great welth and prosperitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seneca.</HI></NOTE> (as it was continual dronkennesse) men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al into a certaine sweete and pleasaunt sleepe. For as <HI>Publius</HI> saith, Riches, maketh him a foole,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Publius.</HI></NOTE> whom she cockereth to much. Paul also wil|leth that warning should be giuen to the rich men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Timo. 17.18.</NOTE> that they waxe not proude, nor haue their affiance in vncertaine riches, but in the liuing God, to do good, and be rich in good workes.</P>
<P>This Securitie is verily the mother of al vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, for by the same a man is made vnsensible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Thes. 5.1. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dges. 18.7.10 2. Pet. 2.19.</NOTE> so that in his consci&eacute;ce he feeleth not the anger and wrath of god against sinne: by Securitie mens mindes are brought into a dead sleepe, that they be not pierced one whit with the feare of gods punishment or with the feare of death, or of the last day, to leaue off their vice and sin. This securitie Christ artificiallye painteth out in Luke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 12.16. Ecclesi. 11.19.</NOTE> where mention is made of the rich man, which when his land had enriched, and made him welthy with a fruitful and plentiful croppe, did not goe about to reforme his liuing, and to repent nor to bestow almes vpon the poore, but studied how to enlarge his barnes, and to make more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oome for his corne, and sayd, Now my soule thou hast a great deale layd vp for thee, which wil last thee for many yeares: now therfore take thy rest, eate, drinke and be of good cheare. But in this Securitie, what heard he of god: thou foole, this night thy soule shal be tak&eacute; away &amp;c. markest thou not, how death co~meth sodainly vp&oacute; him thinking to haue had al the c&oacute;modities &amp; pleasures of the world, as ease, rest, delicious fare, pastimes, delectations, and safegard of al his goods?</P>

These things might be faire examples and sufficient warnings for vs, if wee were not more than senselesse.</P>
<P>The fift cause, is the hope of long life. Among many euilles &amp; naughty affections which folow the nature of man corrupted by sinne, none bringeth greater inconuenience than the inordinate hope of long life, as Cicero saith, no man is so olde and aged, that he perswadeth not himselfe that he may liue a whole yeare. This is the cause why we defer the reformation of our liues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 16.2. Ecclesi. 5.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Gala. 6.7.8.9.10 1. Kings. 10 2. 1.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Malac.</HI> 1.6.</NOTE>The seconde cause is, the ende that we were created and redee|med for, that is, to learne to knowe God, to honour him, wor|ship him, glorifie him, to feare him, loue him, and obey him, as our God and father,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chrisost.</HI></NOTE> as Chrysostome sayth: <HI>Omnia condita esse propter hominem, hunc autem conditum esse propter deum, hoc est, ad agnoscendum &amp; glorificandum deum. &amp;c.</HI> All things were or|deyned to be made for man, man was ordeyned to bee made for God, to the ende to know and glorifie God. &amp;c.

Ireneus sayth:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ireneus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>C&ugrave;m impossibile esset sine deo discere deum, per verbum docet Deus homines scire Deum</HI>: When it was impos|sible to knowe God without God, God by his worde teacheth men to knowe God.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 110.9.105. <HI>Psalm.</HI> 19.7.</NOTE> So Dauid sayeth: that a yong man shall redresse his waye, by ruling himselfe according to Gods worde.

Saint Paule sayeth: Whatsoeuer things are written afore time, are written for our learning, that we through pacience, and comforte of the Scriptures might haue hope. A|gaine: The whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.13.</NOTE> and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to instructe in righteousnesse, that the man of God maye bee absolute, being made perfect vnto all good workes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bruno in</HI> 2. 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 316.</NOTE> That is, sayeth <HI>Bruno,</HI> it is profitable to teache them that are ignorant: so reproue and con|uince them that speake against the faith: to correcte sinners: to instruct those that are rude and simple.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chrysost in Math.</HI> 22. <HI>homil.</HI> 41.</NOTE> Chrysostome also sayth: <HI>Quicquid quaeritur ad salutem: totum iam impletum est in Scriptu|ris, qui ignarus est, inueniet ibi quod discat, qui contumax est &amp; peccator, inueniet futu~ri iudicij flagella quae timeat, qui laborat, inue|niet ibi glorias &amp; promissiones vitae aeternae:</HI> Whatsoeuer is sought for saluation, is wholy conteyned &amp; fulfilled in the scriptures, he that is ignorant, shall finde there what he ought to learne, he that is a stubborne and disobedient sinner, shall finde there scourges of the iudgement to come, which shall make him feare, he that la|boureth and is oppressed, shall finde there promises and glorye of eternall life.</P>
<P>The fourth and last cause is, the sharpe punishment that God pronounceth againste such,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 28.29.16.17.18.</NOTE> as you haue hearde declared before, when we talked of Gods curses and plagues.

<P>You knowe that sleepe was giuen for mans preser|uation, for that nothing hauing lyfe is there that sleepeth not. A|ristotle sayeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arist. lib.</HI> 4. <HI>de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></NOTE> that all creatures hauing bloude, take their repose and sleepe. &amp;c. Sleepe is a surceasing of all the senses from trauel, which is, or is caused by certaine euaporations and fumes rysing of our meate and sustenance receyued, mounting from the sto|macke immediately vnto the braine, by whose great coldenesse these vapors warme are tempered, casting into a slumber euerye the forces or senses exterior, at which time the vitall spirites re|tiring to the heart, leaue all the members of the bodie in a sleepe, vntill such time againe, as these sayde vitall spirites recouer new force and strength to them againe, and so these vapors, or ceasing, or diminishing, man agayne awaketh, and returneth to himselfe, more apt to his businesse, than at any time before. And therefore to sleepe and take muche rest, is not so noysome or hurtfull as you affirme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You haue herein shewed your selfe like a Philosopher and a Phisition: but farre wyde eyther from good Philosophie or wholesome Phisicke. Although it be good and necessarie for the bodie, yet must it not be with excesse, and immoderately taken: for that to much sleepe sayth Aristotle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aristotl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI></NOTE> weakeneth the spirites of the bodie, as well, as also of the soule, euen as moderate and co~|petent rest bettereth them, increasing their vigor and their force, euen so immoderate rest hurteth and weakeneth. For as manye things are necessarie and needefull in mans lyfe, so taking in ex|cesse and out of season, annoy and grieue much: as to eate, who feeleth not howe hunger vs compelleth, and yet he that eateth too
<PB N="19" REF="17">
much, repenteth it, as we commonly see. Sleepe then must bee taken, for necessitie onely, to reuiue, refreshe, and comforte the wearye senses, the spirites vitall, and other wearye members. For too much sleepe (besides that it maketh heauie the spirits and senses, the partie also becommeth slouthfull, weake, and effemi|nate with ouermuche ydlenesse) ingendreth much humiditie and rawe humors in the bodie, which commonlye assaulte it with sundrie infirmities, messengers of death, and of finall ruine. For when we sleepe too muche, all the moystures and humors of the bodie, with the naturall heate, retire to the extreme parts therof, no where purging or euacuating whatsoeuer is redundant. So then vnmeasurable sleepe is not onely forbidden by Philosophers and Phisitions but also is a thing odious to the wise. Ouid with other Poetes, terme sleepe an Image, or pourtraite of death, saying:
<Q><L>VVhat else thou foole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouid.</NOTE> is sluggishe sleepe, but forme of frosen death?</L>
<L>By setled houres of certaine rest, approch thy want of breath.</L></Q></P>
<P>Therefore be you (and all suche as you are) ashamed then, that spende the greater parte of your tyme in ydlenesse and sleepe in your beddes, vntill you bee readye to goe to youre dynner, neglecting thereby all dutie of seruice both towardes God and man.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Holcot in lib Sap. cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> These are the men that one speaketh of, saying: <HI>Diu dor|miunt de mane, &amp; sero cito cubant de nocte,</HI> They will go verye late to bedde at night, and sleepe long in the morning.

<P>Yes truly, I do allow of honest, moderate, &amp; good law|full actiue exercises, for recreation &amp; quickning of our dull minds. And where you say, that holydayes (as they are termed) were in|ue~ted in old time for pastimes, I think you say truth. For y^e Pope appointed them (and not God in his word) and that only to traine vp the people in ignorance &amp; ydlenesse, whereby halfe of the yeare &amp; more was ouerpassed (by their ydle holydayes) in loytering &amp; vaine pastimes, &amp;c. in restrayning men from their handy labors and oc|cupations. S.

<P>As farre as good exercises and honest pastimes &amp; plays doe benefite the health of manne, and recreate his wittes, so

And seeing (say they) that we must forbeare euery ydle worde that God re|buketh vs for,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Math</HI> 12 36.</NOTE> yea, though it be neither othe nor blaspheming of the name of God, but onelye bicause it is ydle, and spoken to no purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 19.32.</NOTE> howe then (say they) can we excuse our selues of all the ydle time that we spende in playing?

It is suf|ficient for vs (sayeth Saint Peter) that we haue spent the time past of this lyfe after the lust of the Gentiles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.3.</NOTE> walking in wanton|nesse, lustes, drunkennesse, in gluttonie, drinking, and in abho|minable Idolatries, to the ende that the rest of the time that we shall liue in this fleshe, we should liue no more after the concupis|cences of men, but after the will of God. There are so many du|ties (say they) that God by his worde requireth of vs, so manye meanes and holy exercises and occupations, to bestow our selues eyther to the glorie of God, or the profit of our neighbours, at all houres both daye and night, yea, though they were longer, and that euery daye had eight and fortie houres. But in stede of be|stowing

our selues in holye exercises, and better businesses, wee spende away our time in playing, therefore it is intollerable, and by no meanes lawfull for any man that calleth himselfe a Chri|stian, to play.

<P>I woulde very gladly heare your answeres to their reasons which they haue made.</P>

<P>My answere is this: We must make distinction be|tweene the ordinarie things that a Christian is bounde of necessi|tie to doe, and those things which are permitted, and graunted him by God for the refreshing and helping of his infirmitie, as to ease him when he is weary, to sleepe after labour, and to play af|ter long paine. Ouid sayth: <HI>Quid caret alterna requie, durabile non est.</HI> The thing cannot indure that lacketh rest. And therefore the holy Scriptures (whiche are the rule of good and euill) maketh mention of playing, and alloweth Christians so to doe. Zacha|rie sayth:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zacha</HI> 8.5,</NOTE> And the streetes of the citie shall bee full of boyes and
<PB N="30" REF="23">
girles, playing in the streetes thereof. Also when Saint Paule sayth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31</NOTE> Whether ye eate or drinke, or whatsoeuer else ye doe, doe all to the glorie of God. Wee maye by this worde, (whatsoeuer ye doe) vnderstande all honest recreations, which certainely is as lawfull and permitted to vs, by reason of our infirmttie, as is either eating, drinking, or sleeping, when wee haue neede thereof. And as our Lorde Iesus Christ sayeth:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marc.</HI> 2.27. <HI>Luc.</HI> 6.5. <HI>Math.</HI> 12.8.</NOTE> That man is made for the glorie of God, and therefore the Sabboth serueth for man, and not man for the Sabboth: so honest recreation is inuented for man and for his health, which maketh vs the better and more de|uout to serue God. Then to playe at honest games and pastimes, is a thing both indifferent and lawfull, and such as are lefte to Christian libertie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gala.</HI> 12 13.</NOTE> as Paule sayth: Brethren, ye haue bene cal|led vnto libertie: onelye vse not your libertie as occasion vnto the fleshe, but by loue serue one another: which thing must be ob|serued in any wise. Neuerthelesse, I co~fesse we ought not to abuse (through too great pleasure which we take in them) no more than to abuse any other thing of the lyke kinde. In very deede it should seeme too great a crueltie to restraine wearied natures, ouertoyled bodies, that they neyther might or durste take some recreation. For although we ought to apply al &amp; euery our doings to y^e glory of God, &amp; edifying &amp; helping of our neighbours, neuerthelesse whe~ we take our honest recreation to maintaine and preserue our vi|gour and health, or to recouer our strength, or to refreshe vp our spirites, that we may afterwarde the more cherefully and fresh|ly go about that businesse that God hath called vs vnto, and doe it the better. The same in the ende redoundeth to the glorie of God, whome we shall by this meanes be more able and readye to serue, and also to seeke our neighbours furtherance and profite. I doe not then forbid or condemne all playe, neither mislike that a faithfull Christian doe sometimes play and sport himselfe, so that such play and pastime be in lawfull and honest things, and also done with moderation.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Christ doth not here clerely forbidde all kinde of care, but onely that which commeth of a diffidence and mystruste in Gods prouidence. You must consider, that there are two sortes of cares. First is that which is ioyned with fayth, by honest la|bour to prouide for his familie things honest and necessarie. For otherwise (sayth Saint Paule) he denieth the fayth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.8.</NOTE> and is worse than an infidell. The seconde is that, which riseth of doubt or despayre, of an Epicuriall care and mistrust in the Lorde, and this kynde of care is here by Christ reproued. For Christs words teach vs, that God will prouide for euery day, that that shall bee necessarie, though wee doe not encrease the present griefe thereof by the carefulnesse howe to liue in time to come. And here you must note and marke, that Christ our Sauiour doth not say: La|bour not for meate and drinke, but be not carefull (sayth he:) he doth not prohibite or forbid labour, but Heathenishe and an Epi|curiall carefulnesse:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Musculus in Gene. cap.</HI> 26.</NOTE> <HI>Verum incrementum Dei non datur otiosis, sed operantibus ac seminantibus,</HI> God giueth not increase to ydlers, but to them that worke and sowe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.11 12. 2. <HI>Thes.</HI> 3.12</NOTE> &amp;c.

And that notwithstanding, the people being once corrupted and infected with this pestilence, shal with great difficultie, and with long tract of time bee deliuered. And therefore he made a law: That if any one of the people had bene founde ydle, by the space of one whole daye, hee shoulde bee whipped, and after by the Conseruatours committed to some one Crafte that he was of, and for euery daye that he was scene to be ydle, the person to whome he was committed, shoulde (for a Monethes space) sette him to anye labour that hee plea|sed, as his slaue and bondman, and that no man should giue him meate, or to talke with him, vnlesse it were to chyde and rebuke him.</P>

<P>I praye you let me heare your iudgement hereof, and first of all, as you promised, of the beginning and instituti|on thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>As touching the first: Men of the olde time were ac|customed with common vowes to sing certaine solemne ditties, both when they gaue thankes to God, and also when as they woulde obteyne any thing of him. Wherefore Orpheus, Limus, Pindarus, and Horace, and suche like Poetes, which vsed the Harpe, wrote their hymnes for the most part, for these vses. Also in the Romane publike wealth, the Priests of Mars which were called <HI>Salij,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Satij.</HI></NOTE> caried shieldes, and sang their verses through the ci|tie. Furthermore it was the manner, that Musicke and verses were had, when the prayses of noble men were celebrated, chiefly at feastes, whereby they which stoode by, might be admonished, to imitate their noble actes, and detest suche vices, which were co~trarie vnto their vertues. Moreouer, they vsed them to recreate the mindes, and to comfort such as were pensiue, beauy, and sad for the deade.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sa.</HI> 16.23.</NOTE> As Saule being heauie. &amp;c. caused Dauid to playe vpon the Harpe to refresh him &amp;c. The vse hereof also we maye reade in Mathews, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Math.</HI> 9.23.</NOTE> when as Christ our Sauiour came into the Rulers house to raise vp his deade daughter, the Minstrels and people were making a noyse, that is (according to their custome) to play and sing.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Exo.</HI> 15.2.20</NOTE> &amp;c. Contrariwise, when any great cause of ioye
<PB N="81" REF="48">
happened, it was expressed by Musicke and songs, as wee maye reade many examples hereof in the holy Scriptures, as of Moy|ses sister Miriam,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iudg.</HI> 11.34. <HI>Iudet.</HI> 16.2.</NOTE> Iudith, Iephtah his daughter. &amp;c. Likewise in weddings they were wont to playe musically, and to sing wed|ding songs. All these things if they bee done moderately, and in due time, are tollerable. For Musicke and songs containe three kindes of good things, that is, honest, profite, and pleasantnesse. For although singing of it selfe delighteth the mindes of men, yet when wordes are ioyned vnto it, which are of a iust number, and bounde by certaine feete (as Uerses are) is much more pleasant. And vndoubtedly Poetrie had hereof his beginning, and cannot be denied but it is an excellent gift of God: yet this ought to bee kept pure and chast among men, bicause certaine lasciuious men haue and doe filthily defile it, applying it to wantonnesse, wicked lusts, and euery filthie thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOVTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why doth Musicke so rapte and vanishe men in a maner wholy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The reason is playne. For there are certaine plea|sures, which onely fill the outwarde senses: and there are others also, which pertaine only to the mynde or reason. But Musick is a delectation so put in the middest, that both by the sweetnesse of the soundes it moueth the senses, and by the artificiousnesse of the number and proportions, it deliteth reason it selfe. And that hap|peneth then chiefly, when such wordes are added vnto it, whose sense is both excellent and learned.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pythagoras</HI></NOTE> Pithagoras opinion was, that they which studied his doctrine, shoulde be brought in sleepe with a harpe, and by the accordes thereof also wakened, whereby they might quietly enioy the time both of sleeping and waking. Cice|ro affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cicero.</HI></NOTE> that rockes and wildernesses doe giue a sounde, and cruell beasts by singing are assuaged, and made to stande still, as it is reported of the Unicorne: when as men will take him, they put a yong mayden into the wildernesse, and when the Unicorne seeth hir, he standeth still, and when hee heareth the mayde sing and play on an instrument, he commeth to his, and sleepeth harde by hir, and layth his head vpon hir lap, and so the hunters kill him.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="49">I may also speake howe the Poetes fable, that when the walles of Thebes the citie were buylt, the stones of their owne motion came togither with the founde of the Harpe. And no man is igno|rant, what the same Poetes haue written of Arion (who being taken by pyrates) playing so melodiously vppon his harpe, the Dolphin fishe, with the great Whales, delyted so muche in his Musicke, that when as the Pyrates cast him into the sea, the fishes caried him safely vnto the shore. So haue they fayned of Orpheus.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 57.8.1. <HI>Psal.</HI> 4.3.4.1 <HI>Psal.</HI> 149.3. <HI>Psal.</HI> 150.4. <HI>Psal.</HI> 33.2. <HI>Psal.</HI> 98.5.6.</NOTE> And also who knoweth not howe muche Dauid here and there in his Psalmes, prayseth bothe Musicke and Songs.</P>
<P>Secondly, we must consider whether it may be vsed in Chur|ches. In the Cast part the holy assemblies euen from the begin|ning, vsed singing, which we maye easily vnderstande by the te|stimonie of Plinie in his Epistle to Traiane the Emperour:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plinici.</HI></NOTE> where he writeth that Christians vsed to sing hymnes before day vnto their Christ, and therefore were called Antelucanos coetus, the morning assemblies. And this is not to bee ouerslipte, that these wordes were written in that time that Iohn the Euange|list liued,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. lib.</HI> 20 <HI>cap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> for he was aliue vnto the time of Traian. Wherefore if a man shall saye, that in the time of the Apostles there was sin|ging in holy assemblies, he shall not stay from the truth. Paule who was before these tymes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ephis.</HI> 13.19.</NOTE> vnto the Ephesians, sayth: Be not drunke with wine, wherein is excesse: but be filled with the spi|rite, speaking vnto your selues in Psalmes and Hymnes, and spirituall songs, singing and making melodie to the Lorde in your hearts, giuing thankes alwayes for all things vnto God euen the father,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Collo.</HI> 3.16.</NOTE> in the name of Iesus Christ. To the Colossians he sayth: Let the worde of Christ dwell in you plenteously in all wisedome, teaching and admonishing your owne selues in Psal|mes, hymnes, and spirituall songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lorde.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.26</NOTE> To the Corinthians he sayth: When ye assemble togither, according as euery one of you hath a Psalme, or hath a doctrine, or hath a tongue, or hath reuelation, or hath interpretation: let all things be done vnto edifying. By which
<PB N="83" REF="49">
wordes is declared, that fingers of songs and Psalmes had their place in the Church.</P>
<P>But the west Churches more lately receyued the manner of singing.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>August. li.</HI> 9. <HI>confesess'd</HI></NOTE> for Augustine testifieth that it happened in the time of Ambrose: For when that holy manne togither with the people, watched in the Church, least hee shoulde haue bene betrayed vn|to the Arrians, be brought in singing, to anoyde tedrousnesse, and to driue away the time. But as touching the measure and na|ture of the song, which ought to bee retayned in Musicke in the Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug. lib.</HI> 10. <HI>confes. ca.</HI> 33.</NOTE> these things must be specially noted, Saint Augustine in his booke of Confession, confesseth and is also sorie, that hee hadde sometime fallen, bicause he had giuen more attentiue hede vnto the measures and cordes of Musicke, than vnto the wordes which were vnder them spoken. Which thing hereby he proueth to be sinne, bicause Musicke and singing were brought in for the wordes sake, and not wordes for Musicke. And he so repented this his faulte, that hee exceedinglye allowed the manner of the Churche of Alexandria vsed vnder Athanasius, who com|maunded the Reader, that when he sang, hee shoulde but lit|tle alter his voyce, so that he shoulde bee like rather vnto one that readeth, than vnto one that singeth. Howbeit on the con|trarye, when hee considered, howe at the beginning of hys conuersion, he was inwardly moued with these songs, in suche forte, that for the zcale of pietie he burste for the into teares, and for this cause he consented, that Musicke shoulde be retay|ned in the Church: but yet in suche manner, that he sayde bee was readie to chaunge his sentence, if a better reason coulde bee assigned. And he addeth: that those doe sinne deadlye (as they were wont to speake) whiche giue greater heede vnto Mu|sicke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hieron. in Epist. ad E phes.</HI></NOTE> than vnto the wordes of God. Saint Hierome, and also Saint Gregorie say:

<SPEAKER>AGE.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pet. Martyr in Iudicum.</HI></NOTE>First we must take heede that in Musicke bee not put the whole summe and effect of godlynesse, and of the worshipping of God, which among the Papistes they doe almost euerywhere thinke that they haue fullye worshipped God, when they haue long and much sung and piped. Further we must take heede that in it be not put merite or remission of sinnes. Thirdly, that sin|ging be not so much vsed and occupied in the Church, that there be no time in a maner lest to preach the worde of God and holye doctrine. Whereby it commeth to passe, that the people depart out of the Church full of Musicke and harmonie, but yet hungerba|ned and fasting, as touching heauenly foode and doctrine. Fourth|ly, that rich &amp; large stipends be not so appointed for Musitians, that eyther very little, or in a maner nothing is prouided for the ministers which labour in the worde of God. Fiftly, neyther may that broken and quauering musicke be vsed, wherewith the stan|ders by are so letted, that they cannot vnderstand the words, no,
<PB N="85" REF="50">
though they woulde neuer so faine. Lastly, we must take heede, that in the Church nothing be song without choyce, but onelye those things which are contayned in the holye Scriptures, or which are by iust reason gathered out of them, and doe exactly a|gree with the worde of God.</P>
<P>Nowe to conclude this matter, I saye, that godly, and reli|gious songs may be retayned in the Church. And yet I confesse that there is no precept giuen in the new testament of that thing. Wherefore if there be any Church, which vpon iust causes vseth it not, the same Church cannot iustlye be condemned, so that it defende not, that the thing it selfe of his owne nature, or by the commaundement of God is unlawfull, and that it doe not for the same cause reproue other Churches, which vse singing and Musicke, or else exclude them from the fellowship of Christ. Yet this ought to be considered, that if we shall perceyue, that christi|an people doe runne vnto the Churche, as to a Stage playe, where they may be delighted with pyping and singing (and doe thereby absent themselues from hearing the worde of God prea|ched) in this case we must rather abstaine from a thing not ne|cessarie, than to suffer thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pleasures to be cockered with the de|struction of their soules.</P>

<P>Yet notwithstanding, although these men that you speake of, vse to play at Dice, and loue that game so well, yet in no myse will be called Dice players, or Dicers, it is so ovious a name, the reason is, for that it is an ovious and wicked play: so the these,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saye generally, it is not lawfull to play for mony, to winne it, and purse it vp, that is, eyther to lose his owne, or winne others, to witholde it as good gaine.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOVTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>What reason is there hereof?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The reason is most cleare and plaine: First that play (whatsoeuer it be) was not appoynted or permitted as a meane and way to get or winne mony, but onely for exercise of the bo|die, or recreation of the minde: so that whosoeuer vseth it to o|ther ende, maketh it no game, but abuseth, chaungeth, and alte|reth the nature of the recreation, into a filthie and vnsufferable gayne, and therefore dishonest. Which (be they high, bee they lowe) Christians ought to flee and shunne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m.</HI> 3.8.</NOTE> as Saint Paule sayth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>August. in Epist.</HI> 54. <HI>ad Macedoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i. Distine.</HI> 35. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Episcopus.</HI></NOTE> from filthie lucre. And in the Distinitions out of Augu|stine, it is sayde: <HI>Hoc autem iure possidetur quod iust&egrave;: Et hoc iu|st&egrave; quod bene, omne ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tur quod mal&egrave; possidetur, alienum est. &amp;c.</HI> That is rightly possessed, that is rightly gotten: and that is right|ly gotten, that is well and truly gotten: therfore whatsoeuer is possessed falsely and naughtily, is another mans and not thine. &amp;c. Tullie sayth also: <HI>Nihil vtile est, quod non sit honestum,</HI> Nothing
<PB N="91" REF="53">
is profitable or gaine (to thee) which is not honestlye gotten: otherwise it is <HI>Turpe lucrum,</HI> filthie gaines. Furthermore, ga|ming was neuer allowed as a kinde of bargaining, traffike, or occupying among men: if wee eyther consider Gods lawe or mans. Amongst all y^e lawes in the world, which haue throughly decided all meanes howe to get, and iustly to possesse other mens goodes, neuer make mention that gaming was a iust meane. The Romane law, which we call the Ciuile lawe, hath verye largely and diligently determined of it. But amongst all the ho|nest meanes whereof the Ciuile lawe maketh mention, gaming is not mentioned, nor once within the compasse. Yet he speaketh of contractes in sale, of letting to hire, making restitution, and such like, whereby we may iustly haue and get that which is o|thers: but there is no mention at all made of Play, or that wee may thereby wynne or possesse any thing. So that whosoeuer ta|keth and keepeth the mony of another which he hath wonne in play, withholdes it without lawfull cause, and therefore agaynst conscience, and to speak plainly, sheweth himselfe a flat theefe. If S. Paule forbiddeth vs to vse deceyte in bargaining and selling, what shoulde we doe in gaming? And if this shoulde be suffred, we shall bring in a greedie couetousnesse, in steade of the recreati|on of the minde, and to be short, a desire to beguile eche other, in steade of folace and pastime.</P>
<P>To gayne then by play, and especially at Dice, is as much as to steale and rob, notwithstanding any customes, euill vses, or corruptio~s of maners.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Francis H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|toman in lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. de vsuris, cap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> One maister Francis Hotoman, a notable lawier and a christian, confirmeth my sentence and iudgement, &amp; sheweth that by the meaning of the law, that gaine gotten &amp; pur|sed vp by play, is forbidden, and to be condemned.

Also it is very reasona|ble, that besides this losse, the magistrate shoulde put them both (that playe) to a good fine, to be bestowed to common vses.

<SPEAKER>YOVTH.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray you let me heare howe it is forbidden by the holy Scriptures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>First it is ordeyned against the expresse and thirde commaundement of God, which sayth: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lorde thy God in vaine. So that whosoeuer v|seth this chaunce of lottes in ydle and trifling things, taketh the name and prouidence of God in vaine. For the lot is one of the principall witnesses of Gods power (as Salomon recordeth) that it is ruled and gouerned immediately by his hande,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prou.</HI> 16.33. <HI>Cap.</HI> 18.18.</NOTE> power, and
prouidence. And therefore we maye not vse lottes so triflinglye, as it were to tempt God, and to trie what care hee hath of the worlde, but onely in matters of great importaunce, and where his diuine will shoulde be extraordinarilye knowne and vnder|stoode. as in diuiding of goodes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Actes</HI> 1.26.</NOTE> choosing of Magistrates, and such lyke, to ende all quarrels or corruption of voyces, and not in sleyght things, as thoughe wee woulde make God seruaunt to our Pastymes and Sportes, and trye what care hee hadde
<PB N="108" REF="62">
of them. Secondly, this play is instituted contrarye to the true nature and ende of that which we in Englishe call Play or Pa|stime, and the Latines call <HI>Ludus.</HI> And therefore the Playe at Dice is a very corruption of Gods holy permission, &amp; of true and honest play. For all playes are appointed and lyked of men for two causes onely: eyther for the exercise of the bodye (whereof Diceplay is wholy contrarie, being a sport of a sorte of ydle vn|thriftes:) or else Playe shoulde serue for the recreation of the minde, and refreshing of our bodies, wherevnto Diceplaye is wholy repugnant and contrarie: for therein is no exercise of our wittes, but we onely stay vpon the chaunce of the Dyce, whyle as well he that winneth, as he that loseth, is amazed and vnsure of his chaunce, but alwayes gapeth for the chaunce of his happe, without any pleasure, but onely a couetous desire to gayne. Also we see that the more they play at such games, the more they may, without any such contentment or pleasure of the mynde as is founde in other honest and lawfull games. Thirdly, the forbid|ding thereof by the Ciuill lawes, and commaundements of ma|gistrates, maketh these Playes offensiue, wicked, and vnlawful, though of their owne nature they were not so. For Saint Paule sayth thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.13.</NOTE> Though I shoulde forbeare from eating of fleshe all the dayes of my life, rather than offende my brother, I ought to doe it: Much more ought we for feare of offence to forbeare this play, in that it is nothing necessarie for the sustayning of mans lyfe, nor of like commoditie to the vse of fleshe, which S. Paule willeth vs yet to forbeare, if occasion serue. For there are other wayes to pastime and sport vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ephe.</HI> 5.16. <HI>Colos.</HI> 4.5. 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.2.</NOTE> than by those playes. Fourthly, the spirit of God commaundeth vs by Saint Paule, to redeeme the time that we haue lost in ydle and vnprofitable things, and to bestow the time present in good and holy things to edification, bicause the dayes are euill. For when God giueth vs leysure ey|ther to read his holy word, to visit the poore, to comfort the afflic|ted, or to doe such lyke dutifull deedes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 25.36. <HI>Iames.</HI> 1.27.</NOTE> we ought to doe it quick|ly, bicause that incontinently one let or other may happen, which may withdrawe our mindes therefrom, a thousande afflictions
<PB N="109" REF="62">
are present before vs, and it will be harde to recouer that whiche we so sleightly ouerslippe. But I pray you is that well spending the time and the leysure which God giueth vs to doe good in,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 6.10.</NOTE> to lose it in playing at Dyce, which I haue declared to be so offen|siue? Fiftly, the beggerly and greedie desire in that game doth so farre exceede all other, that there is nothing that doth more entise and encourage a man to play, than this Diceplay doth. And the reason thereof is manifest, that seeing the loser perceyueth that such losse happeneth not by the cunning of the Player, but rather by his happe and chaunce for that time, he hopeth to recouer hys mony by the sayde hap, which is likely to chaunge, being natu|rallye chaungeable, and therefore playeth on hoping for better chaunce, and so continueth, feeding himselfe with looking fvr the chaunge of the Dice: so as this game is proued to be the very oc|cupation of loyterers and vagabondes, but in playes of skill and cunning, the cause of the losse is soone espied and to be perceyued, and therefore hee that perceyueth himselfe to be the weaker, doth immediatly leaue playe. What shall I speake of the insatiable couetousnesse that is in this Play, while eyther partie seeketh to winne others mony, or rather the one of them to vndoe the other, and also go about to deceyue the other? What shall I speake a|gaine of the great and excessiue losses that haue alwayes bene, and daily are in the sayde play? Some play away their houses, horses, clothes: some all that euer they haue, or can borowe, ere they can leaue off, till all be gone: so entising and alluring is this game aboue all other, which causeth so many come to beg|gery, stealing, and finallye to that vntimely death of the gal|lowes. To this effecte, a certaine Poet and a Doctor of both Lawes, sayth:

<P>Of all games (wherein is no bodilye exercise) it is most to be commended: for it is a wise play (and therefore was named the Philosophers game) for in it there is no deceyte, or guyle, the witte thereby is made more sharpe, and the remembraunce quickened, and therefore maye bee vsed mo|derately.

<P>There are Daunces called <HI>Chorea,</HI> which signifieth ioye, bicause it is a certayne testification of ioye. And Seruius (when he interpreteth this verse of Uergil, <HI>Omnis quam chorus &amp; socij comitantur onantes,</HI> that is: When all the Daunce &amp; fellowes folowed with myrth) sayth that <HI>Chorus</HI> is the singing and daun|cing of such as be of like age. There is also another kynde of dauncing, whereby men were exercised in warrelike affayres, for they were commaunded to make gestures, and to leape, hauing
<PB N="114" REF="65">
vpon them their armour: for that afterwarde they might be the more prompt to fight, when neede (for the publike weale) should require:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plato lib.</HI> 3. <HI>de Legibus.</HI></NOTE> this kynde of dauncing was called <HI>Saltatio Pyrrhica,</HI> bi|cause it was exercised in armour. Of those Daunces Plato spea|keth largely. &amp;c. There is another kynde of Dauncing which was instituted onely for pleasure and wantonnesse sake: this kynde of Daunces Demetrius Cynicus derided, calling it a thing vayne and nothing worth. And if you speake onely of this kynde of Daunce, I say as he sayth, it is vaine, foolish, fleshly, filthie, and diuelishe.</P>

<P>Who was the first inuentour and deuisor of thys latter kinde of Dauncing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are diuers opinions hereof. For as Solynus sayth: it was first deuised in Crete by one Pyrthus, that was one of Sybilles priestes. Others saye that the Priestes of Mars (called <HI>Salij.</HI>) inuented it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Polyd. Virgil de inuent. verum, lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> for they were had among the Romanes in great horrour for their dauncing. Others doe referre it to Hiero a tyrant of Sicilia: for that he to establishe his tyrannie, forbade the people to speake one to another. Wherevpon men in Sicilia began to expresse their meanings and thoughts by books and ge|stures of the body: which thing aftewarde turned into an vse and custome. Some others suppose that men when they behelde the sundrie motions of the wandring starres,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rodul, hus Gualterus in Marc. hom.</HI> 51. <HI>cap.</HI> 6. <HI>Chrysost. in Mat. hom.</HI> 6.</NOTE> founde out daun|cing. Others affirme that it came from the olde Ethnickes. &amp;c. But what so euer these saye, Saint Chrysostome an auncient Father sayth, that it came firste from the Deuill. For when he sawe (sayth he) that the people had committed Idolatrie to the golden Calfe, he gaue them this libertie, that they shoulde eate and drinke, and ryse vp to daunce. One Sebastian Brant agreeth herevnto, saying:

<L><PB N="115" REF="65">Upon a stage had set a calfe of golde,</L>

<P>I perceyue you vse to reade the Scriptures, for you haue collected out many examples for your purpose, which serue you nothing at all, to maintaine your filthie Daunce.

<P>First, that Daunce that Miriam Aarons sister (and the other women vsed) was no vayne and wanton Daunce, for carnall and filthie pleasures (as yours is) but it was that kynde of Daunce which is called (<HI>Chorea</HI>) for they did it in praysing God, signifying and declaring their great ioye, that Moses and Aaron, with all the children of Israell, were passed the redde sea in safetie, and their enimies (Pharao and his hoste) destroyed. &amp;c. And the like order did Iephtah his daughter vse, for the victorye that God gaue vnto hir father against his enimies. &amp;c. And so did the women in meeting king Saule And also Iudith, and the re|sidue of the women. &amp;c. praysed God for the victorie that Saule had ouer the Philistines. And Iudith with the residue, magnified God (as appeareth in the xvj. Chapter) for that the Citie of Be|thulia was deliuered from the enimies by the death of Holofer|nes, and so in going altogither hande in hande, reioyced and prai|sed God in Psalmes. Also here is to be noted in these examples, that you alledge for Dauncing, that Miriam and the other wo|men, and Iephtah his daughter, the women that daunced in mee|ting
<PB N="118" REF="67">
Saule, and Iudeth that daunced with the other women of Israell, for ioye of their deliuerye. &amp;c. daunced not with yong men, but apart by themselues among women and maydens (which celebrated their victories) but seuerally by themselues a|mong men. Also their daunces were spirituall, religious, and godly, not after our hoppings, and leapings, and interminglings men with women. &amp;c. (dauncing euery one for his part) but so|berly, grauely, and matronelyke, mouing scarce little or nothing in their gestures at all, eyther in countenance or bodie: they had no Minstrels or pypers to play vnto them: but they tooke their Timbrels into their owne handes (that coulde play) and not as our foolishe and fonde women vse to mixe themselues with men in their Daunce. And as for that place of Salomon that sayth: There is a time to daunce. &amp;c. He meaneth this kynde of daunce which these good women vsed, which is a ioyfulnesse of heart, which bringeth spirituall profite, and not carnall pleasures (as our Daunces doe.) Also Salomon hereby teacheth vs howe we shoulde vse tymes in their order: As when there is a tyme and cause to mourne and lament, then must we vse it. When God sendeth agayne, good things, we must also vse that, and to bee mery and reioyce in the Lorde. A time of sorowe the widow had in losing of hir groate.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uc.</HI> 15.9.</NOTE> Another time also when it was founde, to be mery and ioyfull. Teaching vs hereby also, that sorowe shall not continue for euer, but God will sende some ioye and comforte. So likewyse ioye shall not continue still, but God will sende some corrections to nurture vs. &amp;c. Therefore you maye easily perceyue hereby, that Salomon meaneth by this worde Daunce, ioyfulnesse and comforte. And by the worde Mourning, hee meaneth sorrowe and calamitie. &amp;c. Also you muste note in these foresayde Daunces, that it was an or|dinarie custome and manner among the Iewes, to vse suche kinde of godly Dauncings in certaine solemnities and triumphs, whe~ as God did giue them good and prosperous successes against their enimies. Are our Daunces applied, reserued, and kept to such,
<PB N="119" REF="67">
vses? nothing lesse.</P>
<P>As for Dauids dauncing before the Lorde, it was for no vayne pleasure and carnall pastime (as your Daunces are, or as Micholl his wife foolishly iudged) as appeareth by Dauids owne wordes, saying: It was before the Lorde, which chose mee ra|ther than thy fathers. &amp;c.

<P>Euery truth is to be beleeued: but euery beliefe doth not iustifie, neither shall your beliefe in this point. The cause why I speake against Dauncing, is verye euill gathered of you, my age is not the cause, nor my inhabilitie the reason thereof: but the cause that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oueth me thus to speake agaynst dauncing, is the worde of God, whereon my conscience, talke, and iudgement is grounded, which worde is so pure and cleane, that it cannot abyde any impuritie or vnhonestie (which in your Dauncings want none, as I haue already declared vnto you.) And whereas you say, that I speake of my selfe alone without authoritie, is vntrue. For I haue already by the authoritie of holy Scriptures disproued it, (which authoritie of it selfe is sufficient, and to bee preferred before all authorities of men whatsoeuer they are. S.

For no man (as a certayne wise man of the Paganes sayth) daunceth, if he be sober, except he be madde. Nowe then, if that either drunkennesse or madnesse be reckened to be the cause of Dauncing among the Paganes, what then shall we counte to be commaunded in the holy Scripture: where we reade that Saint Iohn Baptist (the messenger of Christ) was put to death at the pleasure of a Dauncing wench? By the which thing we may take example, that this vnlawfull pastime of Dauncing hath bene cause of more hurte, than the phrensie of Robbers and Murtherers. This dedly feast was prepared with a kingly large|nesse and excesse, and watch layde when the company was at the most, and then the daughter which was hidde vp before in secret, was brought forth to daunce before the people. What coulde the daughter learne more of hir mother (which was an harlot) but to lose hir honestie? For nothing incly neth folke more to bodilye lust, than by vncomely mouing and gesture, to shewe the ope|ration of these partes, which eyther nature hath hydde secretely, or good maner &amp; nurture hath couered: or to playe castes wyth hir eye, or shake the neck, or swinge hir armes and heare. Wher|fore they muste needes fall into offence agaynst the maiestie of God. For what honestie can be kepte there where dauncing is? So then the King delighted with that pastime, bid hir aske what soeuer she woulde. &amp;c. Thus farre Saint Ambrose.</P>

<P>Some Maydes doe nothing more gladly, and be taught also with great diligence both of father and mother, that is, to daunce cunningly. Feastings out of time, and pleasant sportes, and de|licate pastime bringeth alwayes Dauncing in the last ende. So that Dauncing must needes be the extreme of all vices. But wee nowe in christian countries haue schooles of Dauncing, howbeit that is no wonder, seeing also we haue houses of baudrie. So much the Paganes were better and more sadde than we be, they neuer knewe this newe fashion of Dauncing of oures, and vncleanlye handlings, gropings, and kissings, and a very kind|ling of lechery: whereto serueth all that bassing, as it were Pi|geons the birds of Uenus?</P>

At last (when all shame in deede was past) by reason of the long vse and time of their dauncing. This encreased and went for|warde, that men and women being mixt, daunced togither.

Infinite fro~ thence haue returned home vn|chast, many with a doubtfull minde, but none chaste in thought and dede. And we haue often seene that womanlike honestie in dauncing hath bene throwne downe to the grounde, and always vehemently prouoked and assaulted: yet some of the Greeke wri|ters haue commended it, as they haue many filthie and wicked things. But it is no maruaile that the Greekes doe in this sorte studie Philosophie, which haue made the Goddes authors of A|dulterie, of whoredome, of murther, and finallye of all wicked|nesse.

Therefore Paule sayth (vnto all suche as are come to the knowledge of Christ) The night is past,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 3.12.</NOTE> and the day is at hande: Let vs therefore cast away the works of darkenesse, and let vs put on the armour of light.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13</NOTE> So that we walke honest|ly as in the daye tyme, not in ryot and drunkennesse, neyther in chambering and wantonnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.4.</NOTE> nor in striuing and enuying. &amp;c. Neyther in filthinesse, neyther foolishe talking, neyther iea|sting, which are not comely, but rather giuing of thankes. It is sufficient (sayth Saint Peter) that wee haue spent the tyme past of our lyfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.3. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.23.</NOTE> after the lustes of the Gentyles, walking in wantonnesse, lustes, drunkennesse, in gluttonie, drinkings, and in abhominable ydolatries. Therefore (sayth he) let vs hencefor|warde liue (as much time as remayneth in the flesh) not after the lusts of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31.</NOTE> but after the will of God.

The Poet sayth:
