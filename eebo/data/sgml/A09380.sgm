<P>_AS the giuing of a gift vnto any one (my good Scholler) on hope to receiue for it a greater gift, is a kinde of vsurie: So to giue none at al for feare of losing reward, is a degree of auarice.</P>
<P>Againe, as to repent the giuing of a gift after it is giuen, is a testemonie of imprudencie: So to giue one per|force without receiuing satisfaction for it from the~ that receiue it is an vnwise bargaine. But who so co~side|reth in his giuing of any gift, what he giueth, when he giueth, to whom he giueth &amp; how much he giueth, may not onely be thought a true, but also a liberall and discreet friend.</P>

little Pamdhilet, intituled: A strange Contentio~ betweene three brethren &amp;c. And therfore eue~ as the right gi|uing of a gift, is an act of liberalitie, so a little remuneration is a manifest token of a thankful minde. Now the recompe~ce that I request (for this) at thy ha~ds, is no other, the~ first to haue thee courteously to accept it, next willingly to read it, &amp; lastly, wisely &amp; discretely to co~sider of it. And so do|ing, although it beareth outwardlye the badge of brauling betwene bre|thre~, yet by meanes of the same, thou shalt see theree execrable vices so pi|thily deciphered &amp; set foorth, that is to say, Whoordome, Dronkenness, &amp; Diceplaying, as I haue no doubt, but it shal both turne to thy pleasure, and others Profite. For what greater Plea|sure may be presented vnto the, or what sweeter profit vnto other, then to see, (by sundry exampls, valeable reaso~s, &amp; inuincible argume~ts) those dangerous shelues, &amp; Perilous rocks laid open (thereby the better to shun &amp; auoid them) on which many earst

Well as I saide, touch|ing this my gift, my request once a|gaine is, that you first courteously ac|cept it, &amp; the~ that you request others vprightly to iudge of it. By dooing wheroff they whom you request shal do wisely to themselues, &amp; tha~kfully to you, &amp; you curteously vnto them, &amp; thankfully vnto me, &amp; I lo|uingly, liberally, &amp; curte|ously vnto you all, which am yours in all I may to do you good.</P>

<HEAD>&para;THE ARGVMENT OF this present Boke, Intituled: <HI>A Con|tention betweene three Bretheren:</HI> that is to say, the Dronkard, the VVhoore|monger, and the Dice|player.</HEAD>
<P>_A Certain Father dravving nere vnto his ende, (hauing three levvd disposed sonnes, the one a VVhooremonger, the other a Dronkarde, and the thyrde a Diceplayer, ordained by his last VVill and Testamente, that the most vvicked and vicious of them three shoulde bee depriued of his succession. He being deceased, by reason of the strife risen through this bequest betvveene the sayd Bretheren, they plea|ded their cause themselues before Iudges, for the same purpose appoynted. To the intent that by reciprocall, and mutual accusations, personally declaimed, the mat|ter might more clearely, and vvith greater Vehemency be deciphered and vnderstoode, then if it vvere sette foorth and debated by the voice and Organe of an ad|uocate. The Dronkard first, (as appertaining vnto him for some cause) beginneth the Alarum against his tvvo Bretheren, seuerally, and by sundry assaultes: to the in|tent that he might agayne at one time, receiue from both of them, by one only assault the like. Vpon this the parties being amplie heard, there is sentence gi|uen. Certifying you right courteous and gentle Readers (for it is to you, and to no enuious or malignaunt per|sons, that I addresse this present) that if it please you to beholde the same, it shall not bee vvithoute some pleasure, and as I hope lesse vvithout profite. For the
<PB REF="5">
principall end thereof tendeth vnto the teaching of all men, cheefely and first of all to be carefull of them|selues, and not to thinke or imagine any thing preiu|diciall or hurtfull to their neighbour, neither to search (as Socrates alleaged in xenophon) the imperfections of others, leauing to enquire afte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> their ovvn fault, by examining of themselues. Beeing counselled by this vvise aduertisement, to take heede rather (as the scrip|ture teatheth vs) vnto the great beame that restes in our ovvne eyes, then vnto the little more that hinde|reth the sight of others, that is to say, to consider, make clere, correct and a mend our ovvne great faultes, and offences, before vve intermeddle vvith those litle ones of our neighboures. For to doe the contrary, and to stumble on this errour no lesse daungerous then common, is the right pro|pertie and nature, saith Ci|cero in his Tosculanes of folly and igno|raunce.</P>

<HEAD>The declamation of the Drunkard, against his brother the Whooremonger.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_THe three brethe|ren</HI> aforesayde, to witte, the Drunkarde, the Whoore|monger, and the Dice play|er, being come (according to appointe|ment) before the Iudges to plead their causes themselues, concerning the in|heritaunce of theire deceased Fathers succession: the Drunkarde first and for some consideration, stood forth and after silence was made, sayd in this maner.</P>
<P>I am not ignorante (righte honou|rable) with what weighte and im|portance, the present altrication and controuersie betweene vs three brethe|ren, is pursued &amp; followed by meanes of oure Fathers last will and Testa|ment. By the whiche our vices must of necessitie, be openlye heard and vn|derstoode, and by reciprocall accusati|on, one brother must vnnaturallye and
<PB REF="6">
wickedly by constraint set vppon an o|ther, a deed no doubt greatly to be a|uoided: But he which hath (as hauing sequestred from him all honestie) ac|cording to the French prouerbe, once passed ouer the bridge of <HI>Gournay,</HI> or entered the P&iuml;c bakers dore, that is to say, hath drunke vp all his shame, fea|reth not so much reproch and infamie, as he doth, hunger &amp; beggery, but stai|eth himselfe vpon y^e Greeke prouerbe mencioned in <HI>Homer,</HI> and reported in <HI>Titus Liuius,</HI> that is, to dye for hun|ger is a most miserable thing, which thing hauing before mine eies &amp; with the same, the pitifull complainte of <HI>Franclipeur in plautus,</HI> wher he thus cryeth. O miserie of miseries, to bee hungry, &amp; not to haue wherof to feede or satisfie hunger, to the ende I maye auoide such a calamitie, &amp; not be for|ced to stretch out my hand in begging (if by aduenture I should by your sen|te~ce be disherited) I ente~nd this day to pleade mine owne cause, on purpose by fallible reaso~s &amp; sufficie~t arguments to approue y^t our father ment not to dis|herite
<PB N="2" REF="6">
one of these my bretheren, but both of them, &amp; I onely to be his succes|sor &amp; heir, for so much as I am assured to proue y^t both of their crimes and of|fences do far exceede &amp; surpasse mine, and to make it cleere and manifest vnto you, I am purposed to sette vpon both of them, to the intent y^t the vile filthi|nesse of the one beeing beaten downe, I may with one onely charge and ala|rome assaile the vile infamous life of the other, not forgetting neuertheles how sacred the name of inuectable bro|therhood is, neither how straightly the coniunction of brothers is bounde, nor how much one brother ought to loue an other. But at this present all the same is not so much of my part to bee obserued and kept, as beggery is to be contemned and auoided, beside there is of antiquity a prouerbe no lesse prac|tised the~ co~mon, which is: neerer vn|to me is my shirt then my coate, by following of which euerye man com|monly loueth his own profit more then others. Wherfore (right honorable) not to hold you with to long an oration
<PB REF="7">
know you that our present strife is to vnderstand which of vs three Brethe|ren, as the most wicked &amp; vicious, shall be depriued of our deceased Fathres succession, following the order of his last will and Testament, which of ne|cessitie and infallibly we must accom|plish &amp; keepe, and you to the same, as to the onely marke, directe and areste your sentence.</P>
<P>Now to begin my assault, who is he that doth not euidentlye see that my brother the whoremonger is notably &amp; especially marked as worthye for the vilenesse of his life, to bee disherited more the~ any other. I cannot but con|fesse my selfe to be an excessiue bibber, marueilous desirous of strong drinke, as by the Scarlet coloure on my face and firie heate in myne eyes it is eui|dently to be seene: but though the same be a vice, yet is it much lesse then that of whoredome:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euery man giuen to thinke his own fault <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">east.</NOTE> for (speaking onelye now vnto the Whooremonger) is there any thing more vicious and infamous then to be tormented and incensed euen vnto the becomming Bedlem madde
<PB N="3" REF="7">
for the loue (if so I oughte to tearme lasciuious lust) of one or manye har|lots: and among such vile and infamous sowes not to liue so long, as to lan|guish and to imprison themselues, as in a most vile and filthie stinking hogs stye, and with those lewde Callottes and accursed queanes to chaunge their most desired libertie, into a moste vile and filthie subiection &amp; seruitude wher and with whom they make shipwracke not onelye of good name and honour, (treasures moste precious) but also of health and goods, only there to attayne shame, infamie, misery, and beggery.</P>
<P>If all men, after <HI>Caesar</HI> in his Co~|mentaries, naturally desyre to lyue free and at liberty, hating aboue all thinges to bee helde in seruitude, a thing most noysome and loathsome to all, cheefely to such as be noble and free borne: howe can wee sufficientlye and worthily blast out the execrable vice of the infamous Whooremonger or Ad|ulterer, who like to a brute beaste (for Whooredome or Adulterie transfor|meth a man into a beaste, sayeth <HI>Plu|tarch</HI>:

If shee aske, hee muste giue: if she calleth, he must come: if shee beck|eth, he must be~d, if she biddeth, he must auoyd: if she threatneth hee must trem|ble. No: such a one saith the moste elo|quent Orator, &amp; famous Philosopher, in my iudgement ought not only to be called a slaue, but a most wicked, vyle, &amp; filthy slaue, yea, were he issued out of y^e stock of <HI>Priam,</HI> or anye other more illustrius. But passe wee on farther, al those y^t be giuen to whordom, &amp; ther|on setteth al their minds and thoughts as on their only ioy &amp; felicitye, they be

not only breakers, &amp; disdainers of hu|maine lawes, but also of diuine pre|cepts, &amp; that euen vnto their leauing &amp; losing, both of y^e true knowledge &amp; pure worshipping of y^e only almighty &amp; omnipote~t God, to conuert &amp; turne to y^e culture, &amp; sacrifice of Idolls, &amp; o|ther such like execrable abhominatio~s By harlots &amp; whores, y^e wise king <HI>Sa|lomon</HI> became an adulterer: &amp; for the same, as it is written in the booke of kings, all y^e realme of <HI>Israel</HI> fell wholy into y^e ha~ds of <HI>Ieroboam</HI> his serua~t, y^e stock &amp; cities of <HI>Iuda</HI> excepted, whiche ramained vnder the rule of <HI>Roboam</HI> his son. By adultry many and sundry haue beene peruerted, &amp; y^e sacred estate of marriadge so violated, as bastardes became possessors of y^e inheritance of y^e right begotte~, through harlots childre~ haue assailed &amp; murthered their owne fathers and mothers, by adultry diuers wiues haue died &amp; imbrued their hands in the blood &amp; bowels of theire louinge husbands. By whordome many kings &amp; princes, w^t their kingdomes &amp; coun|tries haue beene betraied &amp; rendred in|to
<PB REF="9">
to the handes of their enimies, euen by those of his owne Countrey, yea, often|times of their kindred, &amp; their Townes and Citties sacked, and throwne to the dust. The moste wisest and learnedste haue become madde and foolishe, and the most vertuous, strong, and mag|nanimious haue bene made weake, and effeminate, and of men (euen lyke as by the poyson and witchcraft of <HI>Circes</HI> the co~panions of <HI>Vlisses</HI>) haue ben tra~s|formed and tourned into swyne, and o|ther such kinde of Beastes. Whiche thinges well considered, is there anye to be found more worthy to be blamed, or more vicious and damnable then the Whooremonger, Adulterer, or for|nicator. Truste mee these kinde of li|uers aunciently by the lawe of the most iust God, were condempned to be pub|likely stoned to death among the chil|dren of Israell (as the most faulty) and it was executed as in <HI>Iosua</HI> it is to bee approued. There be two things great|lye desyred and esteemed among men, that is, renown and riches. For what thinge canne there happen during
<PB N="5" REF="9">
this life vnto menne, that is more pre|cious and deere, then renowne, and the Title of an honest and vertuous man, which thing, sayth the wyse man, is farre better then infinite riches, and vnto vs more permanente and lauda|ble then all worldly Treasures, yea what thing can a man wish or desyre to haue more noble, or more bright and honourable, then a good name, and glo|rious renowne: to attayne vnto the whiche, all labours perrils and daun|gers euen vnto death, are freelye and with a willing heart vndertaken, and borne with an inuincible courage, and constancie, as <HI>Horace</HI> that famous Authour affirmeth by these words fol|lowing, <HI>Thou Glory only doest heat both the heartes and minds of men</HI>: Likewise what greater contentmente is there to be found in the worlde. or what greater felicitie then a wealthye patrimonie, and aboundaunce of ry|ches, for the getting of which, the liues of men are continually in laboure and without rest, and that in suche wise, sayth <HI>Ecclesiasticus,</HI> as a number doe
<PB REF="10">
accompt it better to be without life, the~ to liue in neede &amp; pouertie, as who shoulde say, it is almoste impossible to support and suffer our liues to want that, whereof we haue had afore time aboundance. Now notwithstanding that those two things, renowne and riches, be so precious, excellent, and necessarie, and so muche esteamed and soughte for of all menne, yet is the whoremonger, adulterer and fornica|tor so wicked and euill of himselfe, as he nothing at all esteemes of them, but rather as one without any respect or care, doth willingly make ship|wracke of them: for this filthie lust|ing loue doth alwaies bring &amp; drawe after it, dishonour and beggerie, the reason is forsomuch as y^e whoremon|ger or adulterer doth euer more slen|derly foresee or regard his goodes and fame, of which two things, when a man is once naked, especially of the last, that is, renowne or good name, he is then most vile and reprochful, and as an infamous person is poynted at with the finger of all men, as one vn|worthye
<PB N="6" REF="10">
to bee moned or lamented, be|cause that of his owne free will, as preferring like a brute beaste) lasciui|ous lust and lecherye, before vertuous humanitie, he plungeth himselfe into an execrable puddle of fylthines, wher|in both his goods and good name are so swallowed vp and deuoured, as he euer afterwards remayns lyke one bewrapped in miserye and beggerye: for besides so manye instructions both natural and euident, it is good reason saith the harlot in <HI>plautus,</HI> that infa|mie, reproch and beggerie should fol|low and pursue my company: Be|sides for me and for my sake saith she in <HI>Salomon,</HI> man shall bee consumed vnto a crumbe of bread, y^t is to say, who soeuer haunteth the companye of an harlot, shall wast his substaunce as it were Waxe agaynste the warme Sunne.</P>
<P>Also sayeth <HI>plautus,</HI> the Whore|monger accoumptes of his goodes as of drosse, for without anye regarde hee selleth and spendeth it awaye, for it is
<PB REF="11">
the propertye of these vylanous Har|lots, to waste and ruinate all, soule, body, and goods, and to bee so cat|ching, and shamelesse snatching, that they neuer cease crauing and taking. For euen as the lecherous desyre of the Whoremonger increaseth and spring|eth vp hote and insatiable within him, euen so is the importunitie of an Har|lot neuer satisfied nor fylled from as|king, catching, and drawing? for haste thou giuen her to daye, to morrow thou must also do the same, yea, sayth <HI>Plau|tus,</HI> so long as she seeth anye thing to bee gotten by thee, as money, or mo|neyes worth, she will with sweete hon|nye wordes in flattering wise seeke to content and please thee, and all the roomes in hir house shall be opened vn|to thee, and her seruauntes as slaues shall serue and obey thee, but art thou frowned on by Fortune? or are thy goods and substance gone and wasted? then farewell, fayre friendes haue good daye, for no longer Penny, no longer <HI>pater noster,</HI> thy credite is crackt, and thy former professed friendship, vtterly

Besides, beeing so dis|furnished and powlde of substaunce, euerye one will flie from thee, and re|proche and sorrowe accompanied with greefe will pursue and follow thee, ba|nished from all estimation, as a thing by thee, and vnto thee, worthelye meri|ted, for sayth the Poet.</P>
<Q><L>We cannot inough reproue</L>
<L>him, that his goods so spends:</L>
<L>Or who in lust doth loue,</L>
<L>his fame and credite endes.</L></Q>
<P>Likewise it appeareth, that the worthy Poet, and most famous Philo|sopher <HI>Hesiodas,</HI> went about careful|lye to aduertise and withdrawe vs, by these his verses.</P>
<Q><L>Beware and take good heede,</L>
<L>that thou so rul'st thy hart,</L>

<L>and sweeteliest seeme to smile:</L>
<L>Then onely doth she breake,</L>

<P>Likewise, wherevnto tendeth all the Comicall Poets, or the end of their Comedies, for Comedie is nothing else after <HI>Cicero,</HI> alleaged in the <HI>Au|colastus</HI> of <HI>Gnaseus,</HI> then the myrrour and representation of humayne lyfe, saue onely to reprooue and blame this filthie shamelesse &amp; abhominable loue, and from the same, as from a thing most vicious and infamous to estrange and turne all wanton youthfull folke, as also to bee an example and instruc|tion to flie and abhorre the baytes and allurements of these harlots, together their infinite cautels and deceptions, and as many daungers and euill haps as depend therevpon: beholde in the Merchaunt of <HI>Plautus,</HI> how the father with sharpe threatninges and verball rebukes, with all the force hee hath endeauoured himselfe to reuoke and vnwrap his sonne <HI>Charin</HI> oute of the snares &amp; hookes of harlots, in which he
<PB N="8" REF="12">
was synfully snared, as knowing the same vyce to bee aboue all other moste pernitious and hurtfull, principally to youth, and generally to al ages. In the <HI>Turculent</HI> of the same Poet, sayth one named <HI>Getus,</HI> I cannot better resem|ble an harlot the~ to y^e sea: bicause y^t shee deuoureth, like vnto y^e sea, al y^t she get|teth, &amp; yet neuer will be satisfyed, giue vnto hir as much as thou wilt, &amp; there shall nothing be seene either of y^e giuer or the receauer: for which cause <HI>Dio|genes</HI> in <HI>plutarche</HI> calleth the belly of an harlot&punc; y^e <HI>Caribdes</HI> or gulphe of life, bicause y^t it swaloweth and glutteth vp al things, &amp; is neuer content nor filled. Now <HI>Caribdes</HI> was a gulphe of y^e sea, &amp; very dangerous, which swalowed vp only al that passed by it, neuertheles it afterwardes did vomite it out agayne. But as touching the insatiable bely of an harlot, neither y^e aire, y^e earth, y^e sea, nor y^e riuers suffice, but it swalloweth &amp; deuoureth fields, castles, &amp; houses, &amp; neuer re~dreth or returneth anye thing backe agayne, whiche thing <HI>Argiripus</HI> knowing very well, though somewhat
<PB REF="13">
too late, for so much as hee had bene spoyled of all that euer hee had, in a brothell house, and afterwards cast out of it naked: he cried oute in his com|plaint, and sayd: O sea, thou art not the sea, but you O ye harlots are the same, whereon so manye thousande of yong youths sustaine shamefull losse &amp; ship|wrack, for you suck &amp; sip vp the blood of men, of whose laboures and trauayles you haue your houses most sumptuous|ly and gorgeously decked and adorned to theire shame, ruine, and confusion. Wherefore, sayth <HI>Plautus</HI> again in his <HI>Stico.</HI> Whosoeuer can eschew them, let them eschew them, whose name among the Auncientes, haue bene in such dete|station, as many fathers haue disheri|ted their Heires, because they yeelded their neckes to the yoakes of Harlots. The nature of whome beeing ingen|dered of <HI>Pluto</HI> and <HI>Tisiphone</HI> (sayeth <HI>Palingenius</HI>) is to promise Suger, and honny, but to giue nothing but bitter Gall and poyson.</P>
<P>Among the x. Commaundementes of Almighty God, this one is specially
<PB N="9" REF="13">
noted <HI>Thou shalt not commit adul|terie,</HI> by which words we are expres|ly prohibited and forbidden all man|ner of fornication, whatsoeuer it bee comprehended (as it is written in <HI>Augustin</HI>) vnder this word, Adulte|rie. The which commaundement is notably and very often reapeated in the holy Scriptures, by the onely mouth of God, his Apostles, and E|uangelists. Now then if it behoueth vs inuiolably, and infallibly, and that on payne of eternal death, to obserue, fulfill, and keepe the diuine Lawes and statutes, in which there is nothing forgotten needefull to our health: What sayst thou O Adulterer, O Whoremonger, O Fornicator, which against sayst the same, doest thou not see, or wilt thou not co~fesse thy vicious life to be farre more filthy &amp; abhomi|nable the~ mine? I will tel the, whore|dome was in old time so abhorred in <HI>Italy,</HI> as by the thirteenth Lawe of <HI>Romulus</HI> the first King of the <HI>Ro|maines,</HI> it was establyshed and per|mitted to husbandes and parents to

<P>Likewise sayth hee, those lusting louers, (Lubbers he might haue ter|med them) are so tyed vnto theyre Harlottes, as their heartes, myndes, and thoughtes, are as it were impriso|ned within theire breastes, where they make them lyue and abyde in o|ther bodyes besides theire owne: in suche manner, as the Whooremonger maye saye with <HI>Plautus,</HI> where I am, I am not: and where I am not, my heart, minde, and thoughte is.

<P>Besides, wee commonlye saye in these dayes, the mynde and affection is rather there where it loueth, then there were it liueth.</P>
<P>If it bee then so certayne, that

such villanous loue is no other thing but meere madnesse and furye, and that whooredome or adultery is nothing else but distruction and infamye, doeth it not appeare more then playnelye, that the Whooremonger is the moste vici|ous, and so muche the more to bee bla|med, because of his owne free will hee subiecteth hymselfe to so villanous and pernicious a vice, for the intertaining of whiche, hee committeth a thousande euils, carrying all that hee can catche or come by, vnto his polling mistres. mooued therevnto, by the wrath and iealousye that hee hath, leaste any of his companyons, or other as honeste as himselfe, shoulde shroude themselues betweene her sheetes, a suspition sure not withoute cause, for as it is writ|ten in <HI>Ecclesiasticus:</HI> The common woman is trodden downe vnder the feete of all passers by, as it were dyrt, and myre in the high way, for so much as it is not her nature and condition to serue onelye to one, but to intertaine manye, and of sundry Grapes to make hir Uintage, and fill vp her Barnes,

<P>Thus by reasons before alleaged it is made manifest vnto you (right Honourable) how the whoormonger is not onely moste wicked and infa|mous, but also most filthy and vici|ous, aboue all other: in such manner, that the more I am moued against him, the more matter I finde still a|bounding to beate downe his vile ig|nomious life.</P>

<P>Whosoeuer will please God lette him eschew them, for he with whome the Lord is angry shal fall into their pits, and the sinner shall bee taken in theire ginnes &amp; snares, through which many haue perished, refraine thy heart therefore from them, least thou

<P>Then seeing that the whooremon|ger is in such execration before God and men, it most euidently appeareth that the vice or sinne of whoordome is greatest, vilest, &amp; most infamous of all other, goe your wayes therfore you whooremongers, or adulterers, goe your way and hide your loath|some heads, within the brothell hou|ses of your most lewd lasciuious La|dyes.</P>

<P>In the Annualles of <HI>Fabius Pic|tuer,</HI> I read of a certaine widdow that was forced by her neere parentes and kinsfolke to sterue for lack of meate (in following the same law) because onlye
<PB N="36" REF="40">
she had opened the cubburd priuilye wherein the keys of the wineseller were.</P>
<P><HI>Solon</HI> in his lawes affirmeth, that Prince to bee worthy of death which is approued to bee giuen to drunkennesse, or much drinking of wine.</P>
<P><HI>Pittacus</HI> of <HI>Mittelene</HI> establyshed greiuous punishments against the dronkard.</P>
<P><HI>Aeneas Domicius</HI> depriued his wife of hir dowry bycause that vnknowne to him she had dronke wine.</P>
<P>For the same cause the auncient <HI>Romaines</HI> following the institution of <HI>Marcus Cato</HI> (as himselfe witnes|seth, &amp; <HI>Tertulian</HI> repeteth in the <HI>A|pologitica</HI>) vsed alwayes, and as of coustome, to kisse their frends &amp; kins|women oftentimes, for no other oc|casion, saue onely to knowe if they smelt of wine, or not, to the ende, that if they were thereby taken in fault, they myght without fauour bee punished.</P>
<P><PB REF="41">And no doubt to speake vprightly, all women ouermuch giuen to drinke, little regarding sobrietie, easily and lightly doe leaue y^t reine of continen|cie to follow &amp; prostrate themselues to all vicious thinges. Furthermore, y^e lawe whereof we haue spoken before (made by <HI>Romulus,</HI> which lawe hee himselfe kept and obserued) hath not only ben kept &amp; mainteined in <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> but also in <HI>Greece,</HI> as <HI>Xe|nophon</HI> sheweth in the sayd commen|taries.</P>
<P>To which lawe agreeing <HI>Ze|leucus</HI> (of whome our brother also hath much vaunted him) among many o|ther excellent lawes that he made vn|to the <HI>Locrians,</HI> ordeyned &amp; established that whosoeuer drunke anye wine without permission of the Phisition, should suffer death, wherof <HI>Atheneus</HI> &amp; <HI>Elian</HI> are authors. Moreouer the graue <HI>Romaine Censor</HI> sayth, y^t if any woman doeth committe a vile or filthy offence, as drinking of Wine, she shall be punished sharply by hir husband.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="41">And surelye this laudable&punc; reason that women shoulde not drinke wine vnlesse their husbands license them, remained and stoode in effect and force a long time, among the best and most famous familyes or houses in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>But passing from these prophane examples, I will a little enter among those of the sacred and holy Scrip|tures.</P>
<P>The most mightie, iust, and mer|cifull God, creator of all things, spea|kinge vnto his Minister of holye thinges, sayde: When thou enterest into the witnesse of the Tabernacle, thou, nor thy children shall drinke a|ny wine, nor other thing whatsoeuer that maye make you drunken, leaste that you dye the death.</P>
<P>In an other place by the same di|uine voyce this warning is expreslye repeated to all, ministring in his tem|ple, in the which besides wine ther is also comprised by these expresse words, Ale and Cider: by which words (Ale and Cider,) the <HI>Hebrewes</HI> vnderstand and signifie all sorts and manners of
<PB REF="42">
drinke, by which a man may be made dronken.</P>
<P>And the sayde interdiction was made to the ende that they might at|tende and watche more holylye and warely about the diuine Ministrie: which thing they had not done, nei|ther could haue done, had they bene ouercharged or laden with wine, the onely corruption and marring of the minde and thought, the deuertor and neglector of true worship, and the ve|ry bate or pricke of dissolution and intemperance.</P>
<P>For which cause the auncient Priests of <HI>Aegypt</HI> abstained wholly from wine, all the time of their sacri|fices, euen from the beginning of the~, vnto the ende.</P>
<P>That vessell of election, and most faithfull preacher of the truth Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> condempning dronkennesse, wil|led and ordeined (writing vnto <HI>Ti|mothie</HI> the firste Epistle) that among other things the Bishop should be so|ber, and not giuen to wine, Where|off the decrees make mention, in the
<PB N="38" REF="42">
place conteining these wordes: The~ Apostle condempneth the Priest gi|uen to wine.</P>
<P>And therfore his disciple <HI>Timothie</HI> dranke nothing but water, as his writing vnto him witnesseth, where he saith, let not thy drinke heereafter bee water, but for y^e health of thy sto|macke, and the sickenesse, with which thou art often troubled, vse a lyttle wine. Also in the first Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> the same most Christian Doctor saith, that dronkards shal not inherite the kingdome of Heauen.</P>
<P>For which cause Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> forbiddeth in a manner the whole vse of wine vnto Priests &amp; Churchmen, writing and commaunding vnto his Neuew <HI>Nepotion,</HI> in this sort: Be|ware (saith he) that thy breath doth not smell at any time of Wine, for feare least approching nere any one, thou hearest this saying of the Philo|pher pronounced against thee: this is no kisse that thou presentest, but Wine, the sente of whiche, issu|ing out of thy mouthe, yeeldeth
<PB REF="43">
a most filthy smell.</P>
<P>The same holy man also forbid|deth by expresse woords, all Christian Uirgines, the vse of drinkinge Wine, commaunding them to eschew and abhorre it, as venime or poison.</P>
<P>The <HI>Esseans</HI> a people of <HI>Iudea,</HI> whose sect for their vertues haue ben so highly estemed by Saint <HI>Hierome, Philo~, Iosephus, Eusebius, Plinie,</HI> and <HI>porphine,</HI> dronke no wine at all.</P>
<P>Was it not prophecied of that Prophet, and more then a Prophet, Saint <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> that he should not drinke strong drinke, to the ende that he might choose the good and leaue the euill? an argument most plaine &amp; eui|dent that wine and strong drinke cor|rupteth &amp; peruerteth iudgment and reason: and that a man ouercome therewith in steede of taking and choo|sing veritie and vertue, taketh &amp; choo|seth falshoode and vice.</P>
<P><HI>Salomon</HI> was of opinion that vn|to a king it was good to minister nei|ther wine nor stronge drinke, to the ende that he thereby might iudge the
<PB N="39" REF="43" MS="y">
causes of the poore, with a more iust and sound reason.</P>
<P>Cursed be he saith the Prophet, that riseth early to make himselfe dron|ken.</P>
<P>We reade in <HI>Genesis,</HI> that dron|kennesse was the onely cause that <HI>Lot</HI> that godly man, committed ex|ecrable incest with his daughters, who els by noe meanes coulde haue drawne him to such an abhomination.</P>
<P>After the Deluge, as it is written in <HI>Genesis,</HI> as <HI>Noe</HI> first planted the Uine, first made wine and first dronk thereoff: so also he was the first that was made drunke therewith: where|by we may gather, that if wine was nothing fauourrable to him that first made it, what fauor should any other hope to finde in it saue the like.</P>
<P>Thus by sundry agitations and diuers troubles arising by excesse of wine and strong drinke, the thoughts of men are diuersly tossed and moued&punc; some become madde and furious, full of noise, quarrels, and iniuries: others idle rash and carelesse, of all manner
<PB REF="44" MS="y">
of worke and businesse, some raylors, and gybing Iesters: some vyle and vi|cious talkers: some merrye withoute modestye: some wrathfull withoute vertue or honestye. For wyne in force and efficacie is like vnto blacke Cho|lar, that is to say, of dyuers and varia|ble effects, and of many sorts and man|ners: which thing one of the probleme <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">octors of the most noble Philosopher <HI>Aristotle</HI> declareth, beeing as it see|meth, borrowed by <HI>Horace,</HI> thus wry|ting.</P>
<Q><L>Be it that Wine bringeth ioy and de|light,</L>
<L>Be it that it drawes vs with ease vnto sleepe:</L>
<L>Be it that of it commeth hate, furye&punc; and strife,</L>
<L>Be it that foolishe loue therein nous|leth deepe.</L></Q>
<P>Whiche thing an other Poet also approueth writing of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> as fol|loweth.</P>
<Q><L>Before thy pompous seat,</L>

<L>with discord&punc; sloth, and fire</L>
<L>of furie, grife, and paine.</L></Q>
<P>Of lyke opinion is that <HI>Scythian Anacharsis,</HI> for he saith that the Uine beareth three sortes of grapes, the first of pleasure, the seconde of drunken|nesse, and the thirde of wrath and vyo|lence.</P>
<P>The lyke speache in manner hath bene vsed by <HI>Aesope</HI>&punc; howbeit y^t others say it came from the foresayde <HI>Ana|charsis,</HI> but be it whosoeuer ye will, it is certainly the woordes and sentence of a man both prudent and wise &amp; these they be: The firste Glasse of Wine, belongeth to thyrste, the seconde to delyghte, the thirde to pleasure, and the fourth to furye or frensie. If then the fourth glasse of wine being dronke, doe make menne become madde and furious, what will become of them, that glowse and carowse,
<PB REF="45">
downe their throats, thirtie or fortie at a time? trust me not onely madde but most beastly and brutishlye mad, as: menne transported and alienated whollye from their right sence and vnderstanding.</P>
<P>For most certaine it is, that the more such drunkards doe drinke, the more desirous of drinke they be, wher|by their follye and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nsse doth the more increase.</P>
<P>And sure this alteration and hot desire of wine is no otherwise ingen|dred then by the vicious and exces|siue vse of drinking: vnto which they be so outragiously giuen, that it seemeth rightly, that such men (if it bee lawfull for me to call them men) are not borne, but onely to deuoure, and glowse, or glut vp wine.</P>
<P>Among which number, <HI>Nouelie</HI> a <HI>Millannon</HI> deserueth to bee put, who beeing a Consull during the time of <HI>Tiberius Cesar,</HI> and hauing droncke three <HI>Congies</HI> of Wine at one meale, (which <HI>Congie</HI> was a vessell aunci|ently conteining sixe <HI>Septiers,</HI>) had
<PB N="41" REF="45" MS="y">
no shame to cause himselfe to bee cal|led and surnamed <HI>Tricongiarie,</HI> see|king to acquire renowne and fame, by a most vile, fylthie, and infamous vice.</P>
<P>But if dronkennesse bee so muche the more to bee blamed and abhorred by howe muche the more the partie or personage whiche is infected and noted therewith is raysed to honour &amp; digni|tie, with what worthy note shall wee make the infamous <HI>Bonosus,</HI> that dronken Emperoure of <HI>Rome.</HI> Of whom <HI>Aurelian</HI> was wont to say, <HI>Bo|nosus</HI> is not born to liue, but to drink. Whose death was as honeste as his lyfe, for being vanquished by the Con|sull <HI>Probus,</HI> hee ended his dayes with an halter: of whome being hanged vp in the ayre, this Prouerbe went. This is no man that hangeth, but an Hogsheade: onelye because he had du|ring his lyfe, Tonned vp as it were whole hogsheades full of Wyne with in his belly, for which cause hee deser|ued perpetuall infamie.</P>
<P>Where to the contrarye, the moste
<PB REF="46">
vertuous <HI>Alphonsus</HI> King of <HI>Naples</HI> is worthy of eternall prayse and glory, for his being (among many other excel|lent vertues&punc; to y^e example of al famous Princes) very sober in drinking, for he neuer did drinke any wine, but hee had three partes of water mingled with it, whiche argueth greate generositie in the said Prince: for the right noble ma~ which esteemeth of honour, will aboue all thinges haue dronkennesse in hor|ror, as a vice most brutishe, vile, and in|famous, the abhomination &amp; filthinesse whereof, is impossible to be deciphered and also the euilles and inconueniences that comes thereof.</P>
<P>Because the Drunkarde is vnwise, (sayth the most sapient <HI>Salomon</HI>) and hath no honoure nor prudence in him, I am determined to alienate my selfe and abstayne from Wine: forbidding and warning vs (as the Apostle also doth) not to be like vnto them, whiche therevnto bee inclyned and giuen, neyther to bee assistaunt at theire ta|bles, nor at the meales or banquets
<PB N="42" REF="46" MS="y">
of tumulous dronkardes: for so muche as of dronkennesse springeth dissenti|ons, quarrels, hates, rancours, and moste often, murthers, and slaugh|ters.</P>
<P>Yea, it is the deathe of Uertue: it is the forgetfulnesse and mis|knowledge of all honeste duetye, for in it, (sayth the Mother of King <HI>La|muell</HI>) is no secrecie, but it vtte|reth all thinges, for the tongue of a Dronkarde cannot bee healde, it also commaundeth the wyse as well as the foolishe, the learned as well as the vnlearned, and thereof commeth, Follye, Furye, Presumption, and pryde.</P>
<P>Also the reason why <HI>Denis</HI> (com|monlye called <HI>Bacchus</HI>) after the <HI>Ethnicks,</HI> the fyrste inuentoure of Wyne, is pictured or paynted with Hornes vppon his heade, is not be|cause the same goodlye God of dron|kardes, didde fyrste couple Oxen togi|ther, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> beleeueth, but bi|cause that only by his inuention, that
<PB REF="47">
is to saye, of Wine, and the outragi|ous vse thereoff, menne become hor|ned, that is to say, furious, and easilye moued to excesse and rash insolence.</P>
<P>For onely the moste poore and wret|chedest abiecte that is, if hee bee once ouercome with wine, hee then as for|getfull of his calling and qualitie, ta|keth hornes vpon him, sayth the Poet, that is, hee rayseth himselfe vp in all fiercenesse and presumption, euen vn|to the disdayning of the most noble and mighty, and like vnto <HI>Aesopes</HI> Crane, he compareth himselfe with his superi|ours and betters.</P>
<P>Also the same is to be seene in the most ignoraunt, sottish, and vnlearned, for beeing once vppon his Hornes, you shall presently heare him, bee it righte or wrong, vppon his <HI>Ergoes,</HI> philoso|phying agaynst <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Aristotle</HI>: or so encherubind, he will dispute obsti|nately on some other Art or Science, againste the best learned and moste ex|perimented menne that are in the world.</P>
<P>Yea, onlye the moste wicked and in|famous,
<PB N="43" REF="47">
if he be once dronken, he will boldlye intermeddle himselfe with the most honorable, and stande vppon his slippers against the honestest man that is.</P>
<P>For which occasion the <HI>Scithians</HI> wisely and wittily quibbing and re|prouing the <HI>Greekes Orges</HI> and <HI>Bac|chanales,</HI> (which were wont to cele|brate the Feaste of their dronken God <HI>Baccus,</HI> by excesse drinking of wine, in playing on Tabors, Timpanies, &amp; such like dissolate dronkennes) deni|ed and disavowed that a God should be an inuentor of so pernicious and hate|full a thing (speaking of wine) seeing that men thereby become furious and frenticke.</P>
<P>Also <HI>Diogenes</HI> called such feasts and banquets as they celebrated to <HI>Baccus</HI> in <HI>Athens,</HI> the myracles of fooles.</P>
<P>And <HI>pallingenius</HI> following the same (in mocking also the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who gloried that <HI>Baccus</HI> was brone in <HI>Thebes,</HI> but <HI>Indie</HI> denyeth it,) cryed out: O you offspring of <HI>Cad|mus,</HI>
