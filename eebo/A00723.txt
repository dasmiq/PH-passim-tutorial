AMENDS FOR
LADIES.
A COMEDIE.
Actus primi Scaena prima.
Enter the Lady HONOR, the Lady PERFECT,
the Lady BRIGHT.

Maid.
_A Wife the happiest state? It cannot be.


Wife.
Yes, such a wife as I, that haue a man
As if my selfe had made him: such a one
As I may iustly say, I am the rib
Belonging to his brest. Widow and Maide,
Your liues compar'd to mine are miserable,
Though weal and beautie meete in each of you.
Poore virgin, all thy sport is thought of loue,
And meditation of a man, the time
And circumstance ere thou canst fixe thy thoughts
On one thy fancy will approue.


Maid.
That trouble already may be past.


Wife.
Why if it be.
The doubt, hee will not hold his brittle faith,
That he is not a competible choise,
And so your noble friends will crosse the match,
Doth make your happinesse vncertaine still:

Or say you marryed him, what hee would proue.
Can you compare your state then to a Wife?


Maide.
Nay, all the freedome that a virgin hath
Is much to be preferr'd. Who would endure
The humours of so insolent a Thing
As is a husband? Which of all the Heard
Runs not possessed with some notorious vice,
Drinking or whoring, fighting, Iealousie,
Euen of a Page at twelue, or of a Groome,
That rubs horse-heeles? Is it not daily seene,
Men take wiues, but to dresse their meate, to wash
And starch their linnen: for the other matter
Of lying with them, that's but when they please:
And whatsoere the ioy be of the bed,
The pangs that follow procreation
Are hideous, or you wiues haue guld your husbands
With your loud shrikings, and your deathfull throes.
A Wife or Widow to a Virgins life?


Widow.
Why should the best of you thinke yee inioy
The rest and rule, that a free widow doth?
I am mine owne commander, and the blisse
Of wooers, and of each varietie
Frequents me, as I were a maide. No Brother
Haue I to dice my patrimony away, as you
My maiden Madaine may. No husbands death
Stand I in doubt on: for thankes be to heauen
(If mine were good) the grieuous losse of him
Is not to come; if hee were bad, hee's gone,
And I no more embrace my iniury.
But be yours ill, you nightly claspe your hate;
Or good, why he may dye, or change his vertue.
And thou (though single) hast a bedfellow
As bad as the worst husband, thought of one,
And what that is, men with their wiues do doe,
And long expectance till the deed be done.
" A wife is like a garment vsde and torne:
" A maide like one made vp, but neuer worne.



Maide.
"A widow is a garment worne thred-bare,
Selling at second hand, like Brokers ware.
But let vs speake of things the present time
Make happy to vs, and see what is best.
I haue a seruant then the crowne of men,
The fountaine of Humanitie, the prize
Of euery vertue, Morall and Diuine;
Young, valiant, learned, well-borne, rich and shap'd
As if wise Nature when she fashioned him,
Had meant to giue him nothing but his forme,
Yet all additions are conferr'd on him,
That may delight a woman: this same youth
To me hath sacrific'd his heart, yet I
Haue checkt his suite, laught at his worthy seruice,
Made him the exercise of my crueltie,
Whilst constant as the Sunne, for all these clouds
His loue goes on.

Enter INGEN.

Widow.
Peace, here's the man you name.


Wife.
Widow. Wee'll stand aside.


Ing.
Good morrow to the glory of our age.
Meeting the 
The Lady Perfect, and the Lady Bright,
The vertuous wife and widow: but to you
The Lady Honor, and my Mistresse,
The happinesse of your .


Maid.
By thi ight, I neuer heard one speake so scully,
Vtter such sale wit, and pronounce so ill.
But to you,
My Lady Honor, and my Mistresse,
The happinesse of your wishes.


Ingen.
Stop your wit,
You would faine shew these Ladies what a hand
You hold ouer your seruant. T' shall not neede,
I will expresse your tyranny well enough.
I haue lou'd this Lady since I was a childe,
Since I could construe Am: now she saies
I doe not loue her, 'cause I doe not weepe,

Lay mine armes ore my heart, and weare no garters,
Walke with mine eyes in my hat, sigh, and make faces
For all the Poets in the towne to laugh at,
Poxe a this howling loue, ti's like a dogg
Shut out midnight. Must loue needs be poudred,
Lie steept in brine; or will it not keepe sweet?
Is it like beefe in sommer?


Maid.
Did you euer
Heare one talke ustian like a Butcher thus?


Ingen.
T'is foolish, this same telling folkes we loue,
It needs no words, t' will show it selfe in deeds,
And did I take you for an entertainer,
A Lady that will wring one by the finger,
Whil'st on anothers toes shee treads, and cries
By Gad I loue but one, and you are hee:
Either of them thinking himselfe the man,
I'de tell you in your eare, put for the busines,
Which graunted, or denied, Maddam God b'wee.


Maid.
Come these are daily slaunders that you raise,
On our infirme and vnresisting Sexe,
You neuer me I am sure with such a Lady.


Ingen.
O any by this light, I haue seene a Chamber
Frequented like an office of the Law,
Clients succeede at midnight one another:
Whilst the poore Maddam  bene so distrest,
Which of her Loues to show most 
That hi dull Husband ha's perceiu'd her wiles.


Maid.
Nay perhaps taught her, many of those Husbands
Are base enough
To liue vpon't.


Ingen.
I haue seene another of 'em
Cheat by this light at Cardes, and set her women,
To talke to the Gentlemen that plaid,
That so distracted they might ouer see.


Maid.
Oh fie vpon yee, I dare sweare you lie.


Ingen.
Doe not faire Mistresse, you will be for sworne.


Maid.
You men are all soule mouth'd, I warrant, you

Talke thus of me and other Ladies here,
Because we keepe the Cittie.


Ingen.
Oh prophance.
That thought would damne me, will you marrie yet?


Maid.
No I will neuer marry.


Ingen.
Shall we then
Couple vnlawfully? for indeed this marrying
Is but proclaming what we meane to doe;
Which may be done priuatly, in ciuill sort
And none the wiser, and by this white hand La:
The wrack, Strapado, or the boiling boote,
Should neuer force me tell to wrong your honor.


Maid.
May I beleeue this?


Ingen.
Let it bee your Creed.


Maid.
But if you should proue false. Nay ne'er vnhang
Your sword, except you meane to hang your selfe:
Why where haue you beene drinking? sfoot you talke
Like one of these same rambling boies,
That raigne in Turnebull-street.


Ingen.
How doe you know?


Maid.
Indeed my knowledge, is but speculatiue
Not practique there, I haue it by Relation,
From such obseruers as your selfe deare Seruant,
I must professe, I did thinke well of thee,
But get thee from my ght, I neuer more
Will heare or see thee, but will hate thee deadly,
As a man enemy, or a woman turn'd.
Enter Wid|dow,
Wife.
Ladies come forth, see Sir what Curtesie
You haue done to mee, a strange praise of you
Had newly left my lips, iust, as you entred,
And how you haue deseru'd it, with your carriage?
Villain, thou hast hurt mine honor to these friends,
For what can they imagine but some ill
Hath past betwixt vs by thy broad discourse?
Were my case theirs, by Virgin Chastity,
I should condemne them: hence, depart my sight.


Ingen.
Madam, but here mee, oh that these were men,

And durst but say or thinke you ill, for this
I haue so good a cause vpon my side.
That I would cut their hearts out of their brests:
And the thoughts out of them that iniur'd you.
But I obay your best, and for my pennance,
Will run a course neuer to see you more,
And now I loose you, may I loose the light:
Since in that beauty dwelt my day or night.
Exit Ingen.


Widd.
Is this the vertuous youth?


Wife.
Your happines?


Widd.
Wherein you thought your seat so far 'boue ours,


Maid.
If one man could be good, this had beene hee.
Enter SVBTLE, HVSBAND, FEESIMPLE,
WEL-TRID.
See here comes all your sutors, and your Husband,
Audoome for Laughter, heer's the Lord Feesimple,
What Gentlewoman do's hee bring along?

Enter HVSBAND, embracing SVBTLE, the Lord FEE|SIMPLE,
with young BOVLD like a waiting Gentle|woman
VVEL-TRID, HVSB: SVBTLE talke with
WIFE.

Fees.
One and thirty good-morrows to the fairest, wisest,
chastest, richest VViddow that euer conuersation coapt
withall.


Widd.
Three score and two vnto the wisest Lord,
That euer was train'd in vniuersitie.


Feesimp.
Oh Curteous, bounteous Widow, shee ha's out|bid
me 31. Good morrowes at a clap.


Welt.
But my Lord Feesimple you forgot the busines im|pos'd
on you.


Fees.
Gentlewoman, I crie thee mercie, but ti's  fault in
all Lords, not in mee only, we doe vse to sweare by our Ho|nors:
and as we are Noble, to dispatch such a businesse for
such a Gentleman and wee are bound, euen by the same
Honors wee sware by, to forget it in a quarter of an houre.

And looke as if wee had neuer seene the Partie, when wee
meete next, especially if none of our Gentlemen haue bin
considered.


Welt.
I, but all your's haue, for you keepe none my Lord:
Besides though it stands with your Honor to forget mens
businesses; yet it stands not with your Honor, if you doe not
doe a womans.


Feesi.
Why then Maddam, so it is that I request your La|diship
to accept into your seruice this Gentlewoman, for
her truth  honestie I will be bound, I haue knowne her too
long to be deceiu'd, this is the second time I haue seene her.


Maid.
Why how now my Lord: a preferrer of Gentle|women
to seruice like an old knitting woman? where hath
Shee dwelt before.


Feesi.
Shee dwelt with young Boulds sister, hee that is my
Corriuall in your Loue, she requested me to aduance her to
You; for you are a dub'd Lady: so is not shee yet.


Welt.
But now you talk of yong Bould, when did you see
him Lady?


Wid.
Not this month Maister Well-tri'd.
I did coniure him to forbeare my sight:
Indeed swore if he came Il'd be denied.
But tis strange you should aske for him, yee two were wont
neuer to be asunder.


Welt.
Faith Maddam we neuer were together but wee
differd on some argument or other,
And doubting least our discord might at length
Breed to some quarrell, I forbeare him to.


Fees.
He quarrell? Bould: hang him, if he durst haue quar|rel'd,
the world knowes hee's within a mile of an oke ha's
put him too't, and soundly, I neuer car'd for him in my life,
but to see his sister, hee's an asse, pox an arrant asse, for doe
you thinke any but an arrant asse, would offer to come a
wooing, where a Lord atempts? he quarrell: hee dares not
quarrell.


Welt.
But hee dares fight my Lord, vpon my knowledge,
And raile no more my Lord, behind his back,

For if you doe my Lord bloud must insue.

Dr.

Fees.
Oh, oh my honor dies, I am dead.


Welt.
Vd'slight whats the matter, wring him by the nose


Wild.
A paire of riding spurs now were worth gold,


Maid.
Pins are as good, prick him, prick him


Feesim.
Oh, oh.


Wife.
Hee's come againe, lift him vp.


Omnes.
How faes your Lordship?


Fees.
Oh friends, you haue wrong'd my spirit to call 
backe, I was  in Elizium at rest.


Welt.
But why sir did you sowne?


Feesi.
Well though I die Maister Wel-tri'd before all these
I doe forgiue you, because you were ignorant of my infir|mitie,
oh sir, i'st not vp yet, I die againe, put vp now whil'st
I winke, or I doe winke for euer.


Welt.
Ti's vp my Lord, ope your eies, but I pray tell mee
Is this antipathie twixt bright steele and you naturall, or
how grew it?


Feesi.
Il'e tell you sir, any thing bright and edg'd, works
thus strongly with me, your hils now I can handle as bold|lie,
looke you else.


Knight.
Nay neuer blame my Lord Maister Well-tri'd, for
I know a great manie will sowne at the sight of a shoulder
of mutton or a quarter of Lambe, my Lord may be excus'd
then, for a naked sword.


Welt.
This Lord, and this knight in dogge-collers would
make a fine brace of beagles.


Maid.
But on my faith twas mightily ouerseene of your
father, not to bring you vp to foyles, or if hee had bound
you Prentise to a Cutler or an Ire-monger.


Fees.
I a poxe, hang him old gouty foole, he neuer brought
me vp to any Lordly exercise, as fencing, dancing, rumbling,
and such like: but forsooth I must write and reade,  speake
languages, and such base qualities, fit for none but Gentle|men.
Now sir would I tell him, Father you are a Count, I
am a Lo: a poxe a writing and reading, and languages, let
mee be brought vp as I was borne.



Subtle.
But how my Lord came you first not to  the
sight of steele.


Feesi.
Why I'l tell you Sir, when I was a child, an infant,
an Innocent.


Maid.
T'was e'e now.


Fees.
I being in the kitchin, in my Lo: my fathers house,
the Cooke was making minc'd pyes: so sir, I standing by the
Dresser, there lay a heape of plums. Here was hee mincing;
what did mee I sir, being a notable little witty coxcombe,
but popt my hand iust vnder his chopping knife, to snatch
some Reysins, and so was cut re the hand, and neuer ince
could I endure the ight of any edge-toole.


Wid.
Indeede they are not fit for you my Lord, and now
you are all so well satufied in this matter, pray Ladies how
like you this my Gentlewoman?


Maid.
In troth Maddam exceeding well I, if you be pro|uided,
pray let me haue her.


Wife.
It should be my request, but that I am full.


Wid.
What can you doe? What's her name my Lord?


Fees.
Her name? I know not. What's her name Mr. Well-try'd?


Weltr.
Her name? slid, tell my Lady your name.


Bould.
Mistresse Mary Princox forsooth.


Wid.
Mistresse Mary Princax: she has wit, I perceiue that
alreay. Mee thinkes she speakes as if she were a my Lords
brood.


Bould
Brood Maddame, 'tis well knowne I am a Gentle|woman.
My father was a man of 500. per annum, and hee
held something in Capite too.


Welt.
So does my Lord, something.


Fees.
Nay, by my troth, what I hold in capite is worth lit|tle
or nothing.


Bould.
I haue had apt breeding, how euer my misfor|tune
now makes me submit my selfe to seruice: but there is
no ebbe so low, but hath his tyde againe: when our dayes
are at worst, they will mend in spight of the frowning De|stinies.
For wee cannot be lower then earth, and the same

blinde Dame that hath cast her bleare eyes hitherto vpon
my occasions, may turne her wheele, and at last winde them
vp with her white hand to some pinnacle that prosperously
may flourish in the Sunne-shine of promotion.


Fees.
Oh mouth, full of agilitie, I would giue 20. Markes
now to any person that could teach mee to conuey my
tongue (sance stumbling) with such dexteritie to such a pe|riod.
For her truth and her honesty I am bound before, but
now I haue heard her talke, for her wit I will be bound body
and goods.


Wid.
V'dslight, I will not leaue her for my hood.
I neuer met with one of these eloquent old Gentlewomen
before. What age are you Mistresse Mary Princox?


Bould.
I will not lye Maddam, I haue numbred 57. Sum|mers,
and iust so many winters haue I past.


Subt.
But they haue not past you, they lye forzen in your
face.


Bould.
Maddam, if it shall please you to entertaine me, so:
if not, I desire you not to misconstrue my good will, there's
no harme done, the doore's as big as it was, and your Ladi|ships
owne wishes crowne your beauty with content. As for
these frumping Gallants, let them doe their worst: it is not
in mans power to hurt mee: 'tis well knowne I come not
to be scoffd. A woman may beare and beare till her backe
burst. I am a poore Gentlewoman, and since vertue has now
a dayes no other companion but pouerty, I set the Hares
head against the Goose giblets, and what I want one way
I hope I shall be inabled to supply the other.


Fees.
A'nt please God, that thou wert not past children;


Wid.
Ist e'ne so my Lord? nay good Princox do not crie,
I doe entertaine you, how doe you occupie? what can you
vse?


Bould.
Any thing fit to be put into the hands of a Gentle|woman.


Wid.
What are your qualities?


Bould.
I can sleepe on a low stoole, if your Lady-ship be
talking in the same roome with any Gentle-man, I can reade

on a booke, sing loue songs, looke vp at the loouer light,
heare and be deafe, see and be blind, be euer dumb to your
secrets, sweare and equiuocate, and whatsoeuer I spie, say
the best.


Wid.
Oh rare Croane? how art thou endu'd? but why did
Master Boulds sister put you away?


Bould.
I beseech you Madame to neglect that desire,
though I know your Lady-ships vnderstanding to be suffici|ent
to partake or take in the greatest secret; can be imparted:
yet.


Wid.
Nay prithie tell the cause, come heer's none but
freinds.


Bould.
Faith Madame, heigh ho, I was (to confesse truly)
a little foolish in my last seruice, to beleeue mens oaths, but
I hope my example, though preiudiciall to my selfe, will be
beneficiall to other yong Gentle-women in seruice, my mi|stresses
brother (the Gentle-man you nam'd e' now, master
Bould) hauing often attempted my honor, but finding it im|pregnable,
vow'd loue, and marriage to me, at the last I, a
yong thing and raw, being seduced, set my minde vpon him,
but friends contradicting the match, I fell into a greiuous
consumption, and vpon my first recouerie, least the intended
sacred ceremonies of Nuptials should succede, his sister
knowing this, thought it fit in her iudgement, we should be
farther a sunder, and so put me out of her seruice.


Omnes.
Ha, ha, ha.


Wid.
God a mercie for this discouerie ifaith,
Oh man what art thou? when thy cock is vp? come wil your
lordship walke in? tis dinner time.

Enter hastily M. Seldome with papers on his arme.

Omnes.
Whose this? whose this?


Maid.
This is our Land-lord, Master Seldome,
An exceeding wise Citizen, a very sufficient vnderstanding
man, and exceeding rich.


Om.
Miracles are not ceasd.


Wid.
Good morrow Land-lord, where haue you beene
sweating?


Seld.
Good morrow to your Honors, thrift is industrious,
your Lady-ship knowes we will not stick to sweat for our

pleasures, how much more ought wee to sweat for our pro|fits?
I am come from master Ingen this morning, who is mar|ried
or to be married, and though your Ladyships did not
honor his Nuptials with your presence, he hath by me sent
each of you a paire of gloues, and Grace Seldome my wife is
not forgot.
Exit.


Omnes.
God giue him ioy, God giue him ioy.

Exeunt.

Maid.
Let all things most impossible change now.
Oh periur'd man! oathes are but words I see.
But wherefore should not we that thinke we loue
Vpon full merrit, that same worth once ceasing
Surceae our loue to, and finde new desert?
Alas we cannot, loue's a pit, which, when
We fall into we ne're get out againe,
And this same horrid newes which me assaults
I would forget, loue blanches blackest faults:
Oh! what path shall I treade for remedie?
But darkest shades, where loue with death doth lie.
Exit.

Manent HVSBAND, WIFE, SVBTLE.

Wife.
Sir I haue often heard my husband speake of your
acquaintance.


Husb.
Nay my vertuous wife,
Had it beene but acquaintance, this his absence
Had not appear'd so vncouth, but we two
Were Schoole-fellowes together, borne and nurs'd,
Brought vp, and liu'd since like the Gemins,
Had but one suck, the Tauerne or the Ordinarie.
Ere I was married, that saw one of vs
Without the other, said we walk't by halfes,
Where deere, deere friend haue you beene all this while?


Subt.
Oh most sweet friend the World's so vicious,
That had I with such familiaritie
Frequented you since you were married,
Possess'd and vs'd your fortunes as before,
As in like maner you commanded mine,
The deprau'd thoughts of men would haue proclaim'd
Some scandalous rumors from this loue of ours,

As saying, mine reflected on your Ladie,
And what a wound had that beene to our soules?
When only friend-ship should haue beene the ground
To hurt her Honor, and your confident peace,
Spight of mine owne approu'd integritie.


Husb.
Wife, kisse him, bid him welcome poxo'th World,
Come, come you shall not part from me in hast,
I doe command thee vse this Gentle-man
In all things like my selfe, if I should die
I would be queath him in my will to thee.


Wife.
Sir, you are most welcome,  let scandalous tongues
No more deterre you, I dare vse you Sir,
With all the right belonging to a friend,
And what I dare, I dare let all man see
My conscience rather, then mens thoughts be free.


Husb.
Will you looke in?
Wee'le follow you. Now friend
Exit. Wife.
What thinke you of this Ladie?


Subt.
Why sweet friend,
That you are happie in her, shee is faire,
Wittie and vertuous, and was rich to you,
Can there be an addition to a wife?


Husb.
Yes, constancie, for t'is not chastitie
That liues remote from all attempters free,
But there, ti's strong and pure where all that wooe
It doth resist, and turnes them vertuous too;
Therefore deere friend, by this, loues masculine kisse,
By all our mutuall engagements past,
By all the hopes of amitie to come,
Be you the setler of my jealous thoughts,
And make me kill my fond suspect of her,
By assurance that shee is loyall, otherwise
That shee is false, and then, as shee's past cure,
My soule shall euer after be past care.
That you are fittest for this enterprize
You must needs vnderstand, since prooue shee true
(In this your tryall) you my dearest friend,
(Whom onely, rather than the World besides

I would haue satisfied of her vertue) shall be,
And best conceale my folly, proue shee weake,
T'is better you should know't than any man,
Who can reforme her, and doe me no wrong,
Chimicall metals, and bright gold it selfe
By sight are not distinguisht, but by'th test,
Thought makes good wiues, but triall makes the best:
To the vnskilfull owners eies, alike
The Bristow sparkles as the Diamond,
But by a Lapidarie the truth is found,
Come you shall not denie me.


Subt.
Doe not wrong
So aire a wife (friend) and so vertuous,
Whose good name is a theame vnto the World,
Make not a wound with searching where was none,
Misfortune still such projects doth pursue,
He makes a false wife, that suspects a true;
Yet since you so importune, giue me leaue
To ruminate a while, and I will straight
Follow and giue you an answer.


Husb.
You must do it.
Exit.


Subt.
Assure your selfe deereCoxcombe, I will do't
Or strangely be denied, all's as I wisht,
This was my aime, although I haue seem'd strange.
I know this fellow now to be an Asse;
A most vnworthie husband though in view
He beare himselfe thus faire, shee knowes this too,
Therefore the stronger are my hopes to gaine her:
And my deere friend that will haue your wife trid'e,
I'le trie her first, then thrust her if I can,
And as you said most wisely I hoped to be
Both Touch-stone to your wise and Lapidarie.
Exit.



Actus secundi Scaena prima.
Enter SELDOME his WIFE working as in their shop.

Grace.
HVsband these gloues are not fit for my wearing,
I'le put 'em into the shop and sell 'em, you shall
giue me a plaine paire for them.



Seld.
This is wonderfull, wonderfull, this is thy sweet care
and iudgement in all things, this goodnesse is no vsuall in
our wiues, well Grace Seldome, that thou art faire is nothing,
that thou art well spoken is nothing, that thou art wittie is
nothing, that thou art a Citizens wife is nothing; but Grace,
that thou art faire, that thou art well spoken, that thou art
wittie, that thou art a Citizens wife, and that thou art ho|nest
I say, and let any mun denie it that can, it is something,
it is something, I say, it is Seldomes something, and for all
the Sunne-shine of my joy mine eyes must raine vpon thee.

Enter MALL with a Letter.

Mall.
By your leaue Master Seldome, haue you done the
hangers I bespake for the Knight?


Seld.
Yes marrie haue I Mistris hic  hac, i'le fetch 'em to

Exit.


Mall.
Z'oones, does not your husband know my name, if
it had beene some bodie else I would haue cal'd him Cu|ckoldlie

Grace.
If it had been some bodie else perhaps you might.


Mall.
Well I may be euen with him, all's cleere; pritie
rogue I haue long'd to know thee this twelue moneths, and
had no othermeanes but this to speake with thee, there's a
letter to thee from the partie.


Grace.
What partie?


Mall.
The Knight Sir Iohn Loall.


Grace.
Hence lewd impudent
I know not what to tearme thee man or woman,
For nature shaming to acknowledge thee
For either; hath produc'd thee to the World
Without a sexe, some say thou art a woman,
Others a man; and many thou art both
Woman and man, but I thinke rather neither
Or man and horse, as the old Centaures were faign'd.


Mall.
Why how now Mistris, what lack yee? are you so
so fine with a poxe? I haue seene a woman looke as modestly
as you, and speake as sinceerely, and follow the Fryars as
zealously, and shee has beene as sound a jumbler as e're paid
for't, t'is true Mris. ipenie, I haue sworne to leaue this letter.



Grace.
D'ee heare, you sword and target (to speake in
your owne key) Marie Vmbree, Long-Meg,
Thou that in thy selfe (me think'st) alone
Look'st like a rogue and a whore vnder a hedge:
Bawd, take your letter with you and begone,
When next you come (my Husband's Constable)
And Bridewel is hard by, yaue a good wit,
And can coeiue.

Thus walking off when men talk with our wiues,

It is the highest point of pollicie
Especiallie when we haue vertuous wiues.

How dost thou Coze, hast thou got any more wit yet?


Feesim.
No by my troth I haue but litle money with that
little wit I haue, and the more wit euer the lesse money, yet
as litle as I haue of either: I would giue some thing that I
durst but quarrell,
I would not be abused thus daily as I am.


Welt.
Saue you my Lord.


Pr.
Good Maister Wel-tri'd, you can informe mee, pray
how ended the quarrell betwixt yong Bould, and the other
Gentleman.


Welt.
Why very fairelie my Lord, on honorable tearmes,
Young Bould was iniur'd and did challenge him,
Fought in the field, and the other gaue him satisfaction
Vnder his hand, I was Boulds second, and can shew it heere.


Pr.
T'is strange there was no hurt done, yet I hold
the other Gentleman, farr the better Man.


Welt.
So doe not I.


Pr.
Besides they say the satisfaction that walks in the Or|dinaries,
is counter-feit.


Welt.
He lies that saies so, and ile make it good,
And for I know my frend is out of towne,
What Man soeuer wrongs him is my foe,
I say he had full satisfaction,
Nay that which wee may call submission:
That the other sought peace first, and who denies this,
Lord, Knight, or Gentleman, English, French, or Scot,
I'le fight and proue it on him with my sword.


Feesi.
No sweet Maister Well-tri'd, let's haue no fighting
till (as you haue promis'd) you haue rid me from this foolish
feare, and taught mee to endure to looke vppon a naked
Sword.


Welt.
Well and il'e be as good as my word.

But doe you heare Cozen Proudly? they say my old
Father must marrie your sister Honor, and that hee will dis|inherit
me, and intaile all his Lordships on her, and the heire
he shall beget on her bodie, i'st true or not?


Proudly.
There is such a report.


Feesi.
Why then I pray God he may die an ould Cuckold|lie
slaue, oh world what art thou? where is Parents loue?
Can he denie me for his naturall Child,
Yet see (oh fornicator) ould and stiffe,
Not where he should be, that's my comfort yet,
As or you my Lord: I will send to you as soone as I dare
fight and looke vppon steele, which Maister Wel-tri'd I pray
let be with all possible speede.

I wonder Sir you will walke so and let anie bodie

shop by the head and shoulders.


Sol.
There were no pollicie in that wife, so should I loose
their custome, let them talke them selues wearie, and giue
thee loue tokens still, I loose not by it.

Thy chastitie's impregnable, I know it,
Had I a dame whose eies did swallow youth,
Whose vnchast gulph together did take in
Masters, and Men, the Foot-bodies and their Lords,
Making a Gally-moferie in her blood,
I would not walke thus then: but vertuous wife,
He that in chast eares poores his ribauld talke
Begets hate to himselfe, and not consent;
And euen as durt throwne hard against a wall
Rebounds and sparkles in the throwers eies,
So ill words vtter'd to a vertuous Dame,
Turne and defile the speaker with red shame.

Exeunt.

Hus.
Z'oones, you are a whore, though I entreat him faire
Before his face, in complement, or so,
I not esteeme him truly as this rush,
Ther's no such thing as friend-ship in the world,
And he that can not sweare, dissemble, lie,
Wants knowledge how to liue, and let him die.


Wife.
Sir I did thinke you had esteem'd of him
As you made shew, therefore I vs'd him well,
And yet not so but that the strictest eie
I durst haue made a witnesse of my cariage.


Husb.
Plague a your carriage, why he kist your hand,
Look't babies in your eies, and wink't and pink't,
You thought I had esteem'd him, S'blood you whore,
Doe not I know, that you doe know you lie,
When did'st thou heare me say and meane one thing?
Oh I could kick you now, and teare your face
And eate thy Breasts like vdders.


Wife.
Sir you may, but if I know what hath deseru'd al this
I am no woman, 'cause he kist my hand, vnwillingly.


Hurb.
A little lowder pray.


Wife.
You are a base fellow, an vnworthie man
As e're poore Gentlewoman match't withall,
Why should you make such shew of loue to any
Without the truth, thy beastly minde is like
Some deca'd Tradseman that doth make his wife

Entertaine thos for gaine he not endures,
Pish, swell and burst, I had rather with thy sword
Be hew'd to peeces, then lead such a life,
Out with it valiant si, I hold you for
A drawer vpon women, not on men,
I will no more conceale your hollow heart,
But e'ne report you as you are in truth.

In troth I know not, wiues without their husbands
Me thinks are lowring daies.

Wife.
If any Wife be, I must needs be so
That haue a Husband farre aboue all men,
Vntainted with the humors others haue,
A perfect man, and one that loues you truly,
You see the charge he left of your good vsage.


Subt.
Push, hee's an Asse, I know him, a starke Asse.
Of a most barbarous condition,
False-hearted to his friend, rough vnto you,
A most desembling and perfideous fellow,
I care not if he heard me, this I know,
And will make good vpon him with my sword
Or any for him, for he will not fight.


Wife.
Fie seruant, you shew small ciuilitie
And lesse humanitie, d'ee requie

My husband loue thus ill, or what ee thinke
Of mee, that you will vtter to my face
Such harsh, vnfriendly, slanderous iniuries
Euen of my Husband? Sir, forbeare I pray
My eares, or your owne tongue, I am no hous-wife
To heare my Husbands merrit thus deprau'd.


Subt.
His merrit is a halter by this light,
You thinke hee's out of Towne now, no such matter
But gone aside, and hath importun'd me
To tie your chastitie.


Wife.
It cannot be,
Alas he is as free from jealouzie,
And euer was as confidence it selfe,
I know he loues me to, too heartily
To be suspitious, or to proue my truth.


Subt.
If I doe faine in ought, ne're may I purchase
The grace I hope for, and faire Misteris
If you haue any spirit or wit, or sence,
You will be euen with such a wretched slaue,
Heauen knowes I loue you, as the ayre I draw,
Thinke but how finely you may cuckold him,
And safely too, with me, who will report
To him, that you are most inuincible,
Your Chastitie not to be subdu'd by man.


Wife.
When you know, I'm a whore.


Subt.
A whore, fie, no,
That you haue beene kind, or so, your whore doth liue
In Pict-hatch, Turnebole-streete.

Your whore lies there,
Well Seruant leaue me to my selfe a while,
Returne a none, but beare this hope away,
Tshall be with you, if I at all do stray.
Exit. Subtle.
Why heer's right wordly friendship, ye are well met;
Oh men! what are you? why is our poore sexe
Still made the digrac't subiects, in these plaies?
For vices, follie, and inconstancie?
When were men look't into with such criticall eies
Of obseruation, many would be found
So full of grosse and base corruption,

That none (vnlesse the Diuell himselfe turn'd writer)
Could faine so badly, to expresse them truely;
Some wiues that had a husband now like mine,
Would yeeld their honors vp, to any man,
Farre be it from my thoughts, oh let me stand,
Thou God of marriage and chastitie,
An honor to my sexe, no iniurie,
Compell the vertue of my breast to yeeld,
I'ts not reuenge for any wife, to saine
The nuptiall bed, although she be yok't ill,
Who fals, because her husband so hath done,
Cures not his wound, but in her selfe makes one.

Enter INGEN reading a letter, sits downe in a Chaire
and stampes with his foote: to him a Seruant.

Ing.
Who brought this Letter?


Seru.
A little Irish foot-boy, Sir, he staies without for an
answere.


Ing.
Bid him come in Lord.
What deepe dissemblers are these females, all,
How farre vnlike a friend, this Ladie vs'd me,
And heere, how like one mad in loue, she writes:
Enter MAID like an Irish foot-boy with a dart, and
gloues in hir pocket, and a handkercher.
So blesse me Heauen, but thou art the prettiest boy
That e're ran by a Horse, hast thou dwelt long
With thy faire Mistris?


Maid.
I came but this morning, Sir.


Ing.
How fares thy Ladie, boy?


Maid.
Like to a turtle, that hath lost her mate,
Drooping shee sits, her griefe Sir cannot speake,
Had it a voice articulate, we should know
How, and for what shee sufters; and perhaps,
(But t'is vnlikely) giue her Comfort Sir,
Wping shee sits, and all the sound comes from her,
Is like the murmure of a siluer Brooke,
Which her teares truely, would make there about her,

Sate she in any hollow continent.


Ing.
Beleeue me boy thou hast a passionate tong,
Liuey expression, or thy memorie
Hath carried thy lesson well away,
But wherefore mournes thy Ladie?


Maid.
Sir, you know,
And would to God I did not know my selfe.


Ing.
Ah las, it cannot be for loue to me,
When last I saw her shee reuil'd me (boy)
With bitter'st words, and wish't me neuer more
To approch her sight, and for my marriage, now
I doe sustaine it, as a pennance, due
To the desert, that made her bannish me.


Maid.
Sir, I dare sweare, she did presume, no words
Nor dangers, had beene powerfull to restraine
Your comming to her, when she gaue the charge
But are you married truely?


Ing.
Why my Boy?
Dost think I mock my selfe, I sent her gloues.


Maid.
The gloues she ha's return'd you Sir by me,
And praies you giue them to some other Ladie
That you'll deceiue next, and be eiur'd to.
Sure you haue wrong'd her Sir, she bad me tell you,
She ne're thought goodnesse dwelt in many men,
But what there was of goodnesse in the world,
Shee thought you had it all, but now shee sees
The jewell she esteem'd is counterfeit
That, you are but a common man, your selfe,
A traitor to her, and her vertuous loue;
That all men are betraiers and their breasts
As full of dangerous gulphes, as is the S,
Where any woman thinking to finde Harbr,
Shee and her honor are praecipitated,
And neuer to be brought with safetie off:
Ahlas my haplesse Ladie, desolate,
Distrest, forsaken Virgin.


Ing.
Sure this Boy
Is of an excellent nature, who so newly

Tane to her seruice, feeles his Mistresse griefe,
As he nd they were old familir frinds,
Why weep'st thou gentle Ld?


Maid.
Who hath one teare,
And would not sau't from all occasions,
From Brothers slaughters, and from mothers deaths
To spend it heere, for my  Ladie;
But Sir my Ladie did comund me begg
To see your wife, that I may bare to her
The sad report, what creature could make you
Vntie the hnd-fast plighted vnto her.

Enter his Brother like a woman maskt. Ingen kisses her.

Ingen.
Wife, wife, come forth-now Gentle boy, be iudge
If such a face as this being paid with scorne
By her I did adore, had not full power
To make me marrie.


Maid.
By the God of Loue,
Shees a faire Creature, but faith should be fairer.
My Ladie, Gentle Mistresse, one that thought
Shee had some intrest in this Gentleman,
(Who now is onelie yours) Commaunded m
To kisse your white hand, and to figh and weepe,
And wish you that content she should haue had
In the frition of her Loue you hold,
She ad me say, God giue you ioy, to both;
Yet this withall (if ye were married)
No one, her foot-steps euer more should meee,
Nor see her face, but in a winding sheete.


Brother.
Ahlas poore Ladie, 'saith I pittie her,
And, but to be i'th same state, could forgoe
Any thing I possesse, to ease her woe.


Maid.
Loues blessing light vpon thy gentle soule,
Men raile at women Mistris, but is we
Are false and cruell, ten times more vnkind,
You are smoother farre, and of a softer mind:
Sir, I haue one request more.


Ing.
Gentle Lad, It must be one of a strange-qualitie
That I denie thee, both thy forme, and minde.

Informe me that thy nrture hath beene better,
Than to betray thee to this present life.


Maid.
'is, that you would vouchsafe to entertaine me,
My feee do tremble vnder me, to beare
My boie back vnto my vncouth Ladie,
To assure her griefe; what heart so hard, would owe
A tongue, to tell so sad a tale to her?
Ahlas, I dare not looke vpon her eies,
Where wronged loue, its like the Basilisque,
And sure would kill me for my dire report,
Or rather should not I appeare like death,
holding vp his dart.
When euery word I speak shot through her hart,
More mortallie than his vsparing dart.


Brother.
Let me speake for the Boy.


Ing.
To what end (loue)
No, I will sue to him, to follow me,
Introth I loue thy sweet condition,
And may liue to iforme thy Lady of thee;
Come in drie, drie thine eies, respit thy woe:
The effects of causes, crowne, or ouerthrow.

Can hould out in the end, If youth, shape, wit,
Met in one subiect, doe assault her aptlie,

For fayling once, you must not faint but trie
Another way, the path of womens minds
Are crooked, and diuerse, they haue by-waies
To leade you to the Pallace of their pleasures,
And you must wooe discreetely; first obserue
The disposition of her you attempt,
If shee be sprightly, and heroicall,
Possesse her that you are valiant, and haue spirit,
Talke nothing but of beating euery man
That is your hinderance, though you doe not doe it,
Or dare not, t'is no matter. Be shee free
And of a liberall soule, giue bounteously
To all the seruants, let your angels flye
About the roome, although you borrow'd 'em.
If shee be wittie, so must your discourse
Get wi, what shiftso'ere you make for it,
Though't cost you all your land, and then a song
Or two is not amisse, although you buy 'em,
There's many in the Towne will furnish you.

But still I tell you, you must vse her roughly,
Beae her face black and blew, take all her cloth's
And giue them to some Punke, this will be ground
For me to worke vpon.

Pipes for the lowzie Footmen (and sweete friend)
First heere's a jewell to present her, then

Wer't not inhospitable, I could wrong you heere
In mine owne house I am so full of woe,
For your lost sister that by all my ioyes
Hop't for in her, my heart weepes teares of bloud,
A whiter virgine, and a worthier,
Had ne're creation: Lda's Swan was black
To her virginitie, and immaculate thoughts.

Strike kniues in one another.

T'is plaine now, thou wilt steale thy marriage,

Would t'were so well,
And that I knew the Ladie to be safe.
Giue me no ill words; Sir, this Boy and I
Will wander like to Pilgrimes, till we finde her:
If you doe loue her as you talke, doe so:
The loue or griefe that is exprest in words,
Is sleight and easie, t'is but shallow woe
That makes a noise, deep'st waters stillest goe;
I loue her better then thy parents did,

Wid.
Indeed if they be well laid Princox, one cannot get
them vp againe in hast.


Bould.
Oh God Madame, how meane you that, I hope
you know, ill things taken into a Gentlewomans eaes, are
the quick corrupters of maiden modestie, I would be loath
to continue in any seruice vnfit for my virgin estate, or where
the world should take any notice of light behauiour in the
Ladie I follow: for Madame, the maine point of chastitie in
a Ladie, is to build the rock of a good opinion amongst the
people by circumstances, and a faire shew she must make, Si,
non caste, tamen cate Madame, and though wit be a wanton
Madame: yet I beseech your Lady-ship for your owne cre|dit
and mine, let the bridle of judgement be alwaies in the
chaps of it to giue it head, or restraine it, according as time
and place shall be conuenient.


Wid.
Precise and learned Princox, dost not thou goe to
Black-fryers.


Bould.
Most frequently Madame, vnworthy vessell that
I am to partake or retaine any of the delicious dew, that is
there distilled.


Wid.
But why shouldst thou aske me what I meant e'ne
now, I tell thee there's nothing vtter'd that carries a double
sence, one good, one bad, but if the hearer applie it to the
worst, the fault lies in his or her corrupt vnderstanding, not
in the speaker, for to answere your lattine: prauis omnia pra|a,
beleiue me wench, if ill come into my fancie, I will purge
it by speech the lesse will remaine within: a pox of these
nise mouth'd creatures, I haue seen a norrow paire of lips vt|ter
as broad a taile, as can be bought for money; Indeed an
ill tale vnutter'd, is like a maggot in a nut, it spoiles the
whitest kernell.


Bould.
You speake most intellegently Madame.


Wid.
Ha't not done yet? thou art an old fumbler, I per|ceiue
me thinkes thou doest not doe things like a woman.


Bould.
Madame, I doe my endeauour, and the best can
doe no more, they that could doe better, it may be would

not, and then t'were all one, but rather then be a burthen
to your Lady-ship, I protest sincerely, I would beg my bred,
therefore I beseech you Madame to hold me excusd, and
let my good will stand for the action.


Wid.
Let thy good will stand for the action? If good will
would doe it, there's many a Ladie in this Land would be
content with her old Lord, and thou canst not be a burthen
to me, without thou lie vpon me, and that were preposterous
in thy sexe; take no exceptions at what I say, remember you
said stand e'ne-now, there was a word for one of your coate
indeede.


Bould.
I sweat Madame, you are verie merrie, God send
you good luck, ha's your Ladyship no waters, that you vse at
bed-time?


Wid.
No introth, Princox.


Bould.
No Complexion?


Wid.
None but mine own I sweare, did'st thou euer vse any?


Bould.
No indeede Madame: now and then a peece of
scarlet, or so; a little white and red Cerusse; but in troth Ma|dame,
I haue an excellent receipt for a night masque, as euer
you heard.


Wid.
What is it?


Bould.
Bores grease one ounce, Iordane Almouds blanch't
and ground a quarterne, red Rose-water, halfe a pint,
Mares vrine, newly couer'd, halfe a score drops.


Wid.
Fough, no more of thy medicine, if thou lou'st me,
few of our Knights errant, when they meete a faire Ladie
errant, in a morning, would thinke her face had lien so pla|ster'd
all night: thou hast had some Apothecarie to thy sweet
heart: but leauing this face physick, for (by my troth) it may
make others haue good ones; but it makes me make a scur|uie
one. Which of all the Gallants in the Towne would'st
thou make a husband of, if thou might'st haue him for thy
chusing?


Bould.
In troth Madame, I but you'll say I speake blindly,
but let my loue stand a side.


Wid.
I think it not fit indeede your loue should stand in the
middle.


Boul.
I say Master Bould; oh, do but marke him Madame,

his leg, his hand, his bodie,  all his members standin print.


Wid.
Out vpon thee Princox; no, me thinkes Wel-trid a
handsome fellow, I like not these starch' Gallants: mascu|line
faces, and masculine gstures please me best.


Bould.
How like you Master Prt?


Wid.
ie vpon him, when he is in his skarlet clothes, he
lookes like man of waxe, and I had as leue haue a dogge a
waxe, I do not thinke but he lies in a case a nights, he walkes
as if he were made of gyues, as if nature had wrought him in
a frame, I haue seene him sit discontented a whole play, be|cause
one of the purles of his band was fallen (out of his
reach) to order againe.


Bould.
Why? Bould Madame is cleane contrarie.


Wid.
I but that's as ill, each extreame, is a like viious; his
carefull carelesnesse is his stude, he spends as much time to
make himselfe slouely, as the other to be spruse, his garters
hang euer on the calues of his legs, his dublet vnbutten'd,
and his points vntrust, his haire in's eyes like a drunkard, and
his hat worne on his hinder part of his head, as if he car'd
more for his memorie, than his wit: makes him looke as if he
were distracted; Princox, I would haue you lie with me, I
doe not loue to lie alone.


Bould.
With all my heart Madame.


Wid.
Are you cleane skind?


Bould.
Cleane skind Madame there's a question, do you
thinke I haue the itch? I am an English-woman, I protest, I
scorne the motion.


Wid.
Nay prithee Princox be not angrie, it's a signe of ho|nestie
I can tell you.


Bould.
Faith Madam I thinke ti's but simple honestie that
dwels at the signe of me scab.


Wid.
Well, well, come to bed, and weele talke further of
all these matters.
Exit.


Bould.
Fortune, I thanke thee, I will owe thee eies
For this good turne, now is shee mine indeede,
Thou hast giuen me that successe my project hop'd
Of, false disguise that hast beene true to me,
And now be Bould, that thou ma'st welcome be.

Spilb.

Welt.

some of their cloakes: I will be no shot-log to such.


Draw.
Gods blessing o'your heart, for thus ridding the
house of them.

Exeunt.


Actus quarti Scaena prima.
Enter WIDDOVV vndrest, a sword in her hand, and
BOVLD in his sht, as started from bed.

Wid.
VNiuill man, if I should take thy I e,
It were not to be weigh'd with thy attempt:
Thou hast for euer lost mee.


Bould.
Maddam why?
Can loue beget losse? Doe I couet you
Vnlawfully? Am I an vnfit man.
To make an husband of? Send for a Priest,
First consummae the match, and then to bed
Without more trouble.


Wid.
No, I will not doe't.


Bould.
Why you confest to mee as you'r Gentlewoman,
I was the man your heart id most affect:
That you did doae vpon my minde and body.



Wid.
So, by the sacred and inuiolate knot
Of marriage, I doe, but will not wed thee.


Bould.
Why yet inioy me now. Consider Lady,
That little, but blest time, I was in bed,
Although I lay as by my sisters side,
The world is apt to censure otherwise:
So 'tis necessitie that wee marry now.


Wid.
Pish, I regard not (at a straw) the world:
Fame from the tongues of men doth iniury
Oftner then Iustice and as conscience
Onely makes guilty persons, not report:
(For shew we cleare as springs vnto the world,
If our owne knowledge doe not make vs so,
That is no satisfaction to our selues)
So stand wee ne're so leprous to mens eye,
It cannot hurt hart-knowne integritie.
You haue trusted to that fond opinion,
This is the way to haue a widdow-hood,
By getting to her bed: Ahlas young man,
Should'st thou thy selfe tell thy companions
Thou hadst dishonour'd mee (as you men haue tongues
Forked and venom'd 'gainst our subiect sexe)
It should not moue me, that know 'tis not so:
Therefore depart, Truth be my vertuous shield.


Bould.
Few widdowes would doe thus.


Wid.
All modest, would.


Bould.
To be in bed and in possession
Euen of the marke I aim'd at, and goe off
Foild and disgrac't, come, come, you'll laugh at me
Behind my back, publish I wanted spirit,
And mock me to the Ladies, call me childe,
Say you denide me but to trie the heate
And zeale of my affection toward you,
Then clap't vp with arime, as for example.
Hee coldly loues, retires, for one vaine triall,
For wee are yeelding, when we make deniall.


Wid.
Seruant I make no question, from this time
You'll hold a more reuerent opinion

Of some that weare long coates, and tis my pride,
To assure you that there are amongst vs good:
And with this continencie, if you goe away,
I'le be so farre from thinking it defect,
That I will hold you worthiest of men.


Bould.
S'hart, I am Tantalus, my long'd for fruit
Bobs at my lips, yet still it shrinks from me.
Haue not I that, which men say neuer failes
To o'recome any? oportunitie?
Come, come, I am too cold in my assault.
By all the vertues, that yet euer were
In man, or woman, I with reuerence
Doe loue thee Ladie, but will be no foole
To let occasion slip, her fore-top from me.


Wid.
You will faile this way to, vpon my knees
I doe desire thee to preserue thy vertues,
And with my teares my honor; t'is as bad
To loose our worths to them, or to deceaue
Who haue held worthy opinions of vs,
As to betray trust: all this I implore
For thine owne sake, not mine, as for my selfe,
If thou bee'st violent, by this stupid night,
And all the mischiefes her darke wombe hath bred,
I'le raise the house, I'le crie a rape.


Bo.
I hope you will not hang me, that were murther Ladie,
A greater sinne, then lying with me sure.


Wid.
Come, flatter not your selfe with argument,
I will exclaime; the law hangs you, not I,
Or if I did, I had rather farre confound
The deerest bodie in the world to me,
Then that, that bodie, should confound my soule.


Bould.
Your soule, ahlas Mistresse, are you so fond
To thinke her generall destruction
Can be procur'd by such a naturall act,
Which beasts are borne to and haue priuiledge in?
Fie, fiie, if this could be, farre happier
Are sensitiue soules in their creation
Than man the prince of creatures, thinke you Heauen

Regards such mortall deeds, or punisheth
Those acts, for which he hath ordained vs?


Wid.
You argue like an Atheist, man is neuer
The prince of creatures, as you call him now,
But in his reason, faile that, he is worse
Than Horse or Dog, or beasts of wildernesse,
And tis that reason teacheth vs to doe
Our actions vnlike them: then that which you
Termed in them a priuiledge beyond vs,
The basenesse of their being doth expresse,
Compar'd to ours, Horses, Buls, and Swine,
Doe leape their Dams, because man does not so,
Shall we conclude his making happilesse?


Bould.
You put me downe, yet will not put me downe,
I am too gentle, some of you I haue heard,
Loue not these words but force, to haue it done
As they sing prick-song, e'ne at the first sight.


Wid.
Go too, keep off, by Heauen and Earth, i'le call else.


Bould
How if no bodie heare you?


Wid.
If they doe not,
I'le kill you with mine owne hand, neuer stare,
Or failing that fall on this sword my selfe.


Bould.
Oh widdow wonderfull, if thou bee'st not honest.
Now God forgiue my mother and my sisters.
Thinke but how finely Madam vndiscouer'd
For euer you and I, might liue all day your Gentlewoman
To doe you seruice, but all night your man
To doe you seruice, newnesse of the trick,
If nothing else might stirre ye.


Wid.
T'is a stale one
And was done in the Fleete ten yeares agoe,
Will you begon? the doore is open for you.


Bould.
Let me but tarrie till the morning Madam,
To send for clothes, shall I goe naked home.


Wid.
T'is best time now, it is but one a clock,
And you may goe vnseene, I sweare by Heauen,
I would spend all the night to sit and talke w'ee,
If I durst trust you, I doe loue you so,

My bloud forsakes my heart now you depart.


Bould.
S'hart, will you marrie me heereafter then?


Wid.
No, you are too yong, and I am much too old;
I and vnworthy, and the world will say,
We married not for loue, good morrow seruant.
Ex. Wid.


Bould.
Why so? these women are the erranst Iuglers in
the World, the wry-leg'd fellow is an Asse to 'em. Well I
Mu|sique.
must haue this wddow, what e're come on't: Faith she has
turn'd me out of her seruice verie barely, harke, whats heere,
musique.

Enter SVBTLE with a paper, and his BOY with a cloake.

Subt.
Rise Ladie Mistresse, rise:
The night hath tedious beene,
No sleepe hath fallen into my eies,
Nor slumbers made me sinne.
Is not she a Saint then say,
Thought of whom keepes sinne away?
Rise Madame, rise and giue me light,
Whom darkenesse still will couer.
And ignorance darker than night,
Till thou smile on thy louer;
All want day  thy beautie rise,
For the grate morne breakes from thine eies.
Now sing it sirrha.

[The Song sung by the Boy.

Subt.
S'foote, who's this? yong Master Bould? God saue
you, you are an earely stirrer.


Bould.
You say true Master Subtle, I haue beene earely
vp, but as God helpe me, I was neuer the neere.


Subt.
Where haue you beene Sir?


Bould.
What's that to you Sir? at a womans labour.


Subt.
Very good: I neare tooke you for a man Mid-wife
before.


Bould.
The troth is, I haue beene vp all night at dice, 
lost my clothes, good morrow Master Subtle, pray God the
Watch be broke vp: I thanke you for my Musique:
Exit:


Subt:
Tis palpable by this aire, her husband and being abroad,
Bould has layen with her, and is now con'd out of doores.
Is this the Ladie Perfect with a poxe? The truth is, her ver|tuous

chastitie, began to make me make a myracle of her,
still holding out to me, notwithstanding her husbands most
barbarous vsage of her, but now indeede t'is no maruaile
since another possesses her. Well Madame, Ile go finde out
your Cuckold, ile be reueng'd on you and tell a tale
Shall tickle him, this is a cheate in loue,
Not to be borne, another to beguile
Me of the game, I plaid for all this while.
Exit.

Enter WELTRI'D, and BOVLD puting on his doublet,
FEE-SIMPLE on a bed, as in Bould's chamber.

Welt.
You see, we made bould with your lodging, indeed,
I did assure my selfe, you were fast for this night.


Bo.
But how the Deuill came this foole in your companie?


Welt.
S'foote man, I carried him last night among the
Rorers, to flesh him, and by this light he got drunke, and
beate e'm all.


Bould.
Why then he can endure the sight of a drawne
sword now?


Welt.
Oh God Sir, I thinke in my conscience, he will eate
steele shortlie, I know not how his conuersion will hold
after this sleepe, but in an houre or two (last night) he was
growne such a little dam-me, that I protest, I was afraid of
the spirit, that I my selfe had rais'd in him: but this other
matter of your expulsion thus mads me to the heart; Were
you in bed with her?


Bould.
In bed by Heauen.


Welt.
I'le e hang'd, if you were not busie to soone, you
should haue let her slept first.


Bould.
Z'oones man, she put her hands to my breasts and
swore I was no maid, now I being eager to proue her words
true, tooke that hint, and would violently haue thrust her
hand lower, when her thought being swifter then my
strength, made her no sooner imagine that she was betrai'd,
but she leapes out of the bed, whips me downe a sword that
hung by, and as, if fortitude and justice had met to assist
her, spight of all argument faire or fowle she forc't me away.


Welt.
But is't possible thou should'st haue no more wit,
would'st thou come away vpon any tearmes, but sure ones,

hauing night, her chamber and her selfe naked in thine
armes? By that light, if I had a sonne of 4 whom I had
help 't thus farre, that had seru'd me so, I would breech him.


Bould.
S'hart, what would you haue me done?


Welt.
Haue done? done, done twice at least.


Bould.
Haue plaid Tarquin and rauish't her.


Welt.
Pish, Tarquin was a block-head, if he had had any
wit and could haue spoke, Lucrce had neuer been rauished,
she would haue yeelded, I warrant thee,  so wil any woman


Bould.
I was such an erronious heretique to loue, and
women, as thou art, till now.


Welt.
God's pretious, it makes me mad, when I thinke
on't: was there euer such an obsur'd trick? now will she a|buse
thee horriblie, say thou art a faint-hearted fellow, a
milk-sop and I know not what, as indeede thou art.


Bould.
Z'oones, would you had beene in my place.


Welt.
Z'oones, I would I had, I would haue so jumbl'd her
honestie: would'st thou be held out at staues end with words?
dost not thou know a widdow's a weake vessell, and is easily
cast if you close.


Bould.
Weltri'd, you deale vnfriendly.


Welt.
By this light I shal blush to be seen in thy companie.


Bould.
Pray leaue my chamber.


Welt.
Poxe vpon your chamber,
I care not for your chamber, nor your selfe
More than you care for me.


Bo.
S'blood I as little for you.


Welt.
Why fare you well.


Bo.
Why, fare-well you. Weltri'd, I prithee stay,
Thou know'st I loue thee.


Welt.
S'hart, I loue you as well; but for my spleene, or
choller I thinke, I haue as much as you.


Bo.
Well friend, this is the businesse you must doe for me,
Repaire vnto the widdow, where giue out,
To morrow morne, I shall be married,
Inuite her to the wedding, I haue a trick,
To put vpon this Lord to, whom I made
My instrument to preferre me.


Welt.
What shall follow,

I will not aske, because I meane to see't.
The ars 'twixt friends, still keeps their friendship sweet.
Ex.


Feesi.
Why Weltri'd, you rogue, whats that a vision?


Bould.
Why how now my Lord? who do you call rogue?
the Gentleman you name is my friend, if you were wise I
should be angrie.


Feesi.
Angrie with me? why dam me Sir, and you be;
Cut with your sword, it is not with me I tell you
As it was yesterday, I am fleshman, I.
Haue you any thing to say to me?


Bould.
Nothing but this, how many doe you thinke,
you haue slaine last night?


Feesi.
Why fiue, I neuer kill lesse.


Bould.
There was but foure: my Lord, you had best pro|uide
your selfe and begon, three you haue slaine starke dead.


Feesi.
You jest.


Bould.
T'is most true, Weltri'd is fled.


Feesi.
Why let the Rorers meddle with me another time,
as for flying, I scorne it, I kild 'em like a man; when did you
euer see a Lord hang for any thing? we may kill whom we
list, marry my conscience picks me; ah plague a this drinke,
what things it makes vs doe, I doe no more remember this
now than a puppie-dogge.
Oh bloodie Lord that art bedawb'd with gore,
Vaine world adiew, for I will rore no more.


Bould
Nay stay my Lord, I did but trie the tendernesse
of your conscience, all this is nothing so, but to sweeten the
tale (I haue for you) I foretold you this fain'd mischance.


Feesi.
Is it a tale belonging to the Widdow?


Bould.
I thinke you are a witch.


Feesi.
My grand-mother was suspected.


Bould.
The Widdow has desired you by me to meete her
to morrow morning at Church in some vknowne disguise,
least any suspect it, for quoth she,
Long hath he held me fast in his moist hand,
Therefore I will be his in nuptiall band.


Feesi.
Bould, I haue euer taken you to be my friend, I am
very wise now, and valiant, if this be not true, damme Sir,

you are the sonne of a whore, and you lie, and I will make it
good with my sword.


Bould.
I am, what e're you please Sir, If it be not true, I will
goe with you to the Church my selfe, your disguise I haue
thought on; the Widdow is your owne. Come, leaue your
fooling.


Feesi.
If this be true, thou little Boy,

Cant.

Bould.
So true, as thou tel'st to me,
To morrow morne when I haue the Widdow,
My deare friend shalt thou be.

Exeunt.
Enter MAID like the foote-boy: SELDOME with a
couple of SERIEANTS, PITS, DONNER.

Maid.
Sir, t'is most true and in this shall you be
vnlike to other Citizens that arrest
To vndoe Gentlemen: your clemencie heere
perchance saues two liues, one from the others sword,
The other from the Lawes; this morne they fight,
And though your debtor be a Lord, yet should he
Miscarrie, certainely your debt were lost.


Seld.
Do'st thou serue the Lord Proudly?


Maid.
Sir, I do.


Seld.
Well, such a Boy as thou, is worth more money
Then thy Lord owes me, t'is not for the debt
I doe arrest him, but to end this strife,
Which both may loose my money and his life.

Enter Lord PROVDLY with a riding rod.

Pr.
My Horse there, Z'oones I would not for the world
He should alight before me in the field,
My name and henor were for euer lost.


Seld.
Good morrow to your Honor, I doe heare
Your Lordship this faire morning is to fight,
And for your honor: Did you neuer see
The Play, where the fat Knight hight Old-castle,
Did tell you truly what this honor was?


Pr.
Why, how now good man flat-cap, what d'ee lack?
Who doe you talke to, sirrha?


1. Serg.
We arrest you.


Pr.
Arrest me, rogue? I am a Lord ye curs, a Parliament
man.


2. Serg.
Sir, we arest you though.


Pr.
At whose suit?



Seld.
At mine, Sir.


Pr.
Why thou base rogue, did not I set thee vp,
Hauing no stock, but thy faire shop and wise?


Seld.
Into my house with him.


Maid.
Away with him, away with him.


Pr.
A plot, a trick by Heauen. See Ingens foote-boy, t'is
by his Masters meanes, oh coward, slaue; i'le put in baile, or
pay the debt.


Sel.
I, I, I, wee'll talke with you withinthrust him in.
Ex.

Enter INGEN looking on his sword and bending it,
his brother like a Man.

Ing.
If I miscarrie Franck, I prithee see
All my debts paid, about fiue hundred pounds
Will fully satisfie all men, and my land
And what I else possesse, by natures right
And thy descent, Franck, I make freely thine.


Broth.
I know, you doe not thinke I wish you dead
For all the benefit: besides, your spirit
So opposite to counsaile, to auert
Your resolution, that I saue my breath,
Which would be lost in vaine, to expire and spend
Vpon your foe, if you fall vnder him.


Ing.
Franck, I protest you shall doe iniurie
Vnto my foe, and much disturbance to
Vnto my soule departing, die I heere
Fairely, and on my single enemies sword,
If you should not let him go off vntouch't.
Now by the Master of thy life and mine,
I loue thee Boy, beyond any example,
As well as thou do'st me, but should I goe
Thy second to the field, as thou dost mine,
And if thine enemie kild thee like a man,
I would desire, neuer to see him more,
But he should beare himselfe off with those wounds
He had receau'd from thee, for that time safe,
And without persecution by the Law,
For what hap is our foes, might be our owne,
And no mans iudgement, sits in Iustice place,

But weighing other mens as his owne case.


Broth.
He has the aduantage of you being a Lord,
For should you kill him, you are sure to die,
And by some Lawyer with a golden tongue,
That cries for right, ten angels on his side;
Your daring meete him, cal'd presumption:
But kill he you, hee, and his noble friends
Haue such a golden snaffle for the jawes
Of man, deuouring Pithagorean Law,
Thei'le reyne her stubborne chaps, e'ne to her taile?
And though she haue yron eeth to meaner men,
So master her, that who displeasd her most,
She shall lie vnder like a tired jade,
For small boates on rough seas are quickly lost,
But ships ride safe, and cut what by they list.


Ing.
Follow what may, I am resolu'd deare Brother,
This monster vallor, that doth feed on men,
Groanes in me for my reputation.
This charge I giue thee to, If I doe die,
Neuer to part from the yong Boy, which late
I entertain'd, but loue him for my sake:
And for my Mistresse the Ladie Honor,
Whom to deceiue, I haue deceiu'd my selfe.
If she be dead, pray God I may giue vp
My life a sacrifice on her, brothers sword;
But if thou liu'st to see her gentle brother,
If I be slaine, tell her I dy'de because
I had transgrest against her worthy loue.
This sword is not well mounted, lets see thine.

Enter MAID like a foote-boy.

Maid.
Your staying Sir, is in vaine, for my Lord Proudly,
Iust at his taking horse to meete you heere,
At Seldomes suit the Citizen, was arrested
Vpon an action of two hundred pounds,
I saw it Sir, t'is true.


Ing.
Oh, scuruie Lord,
It had beene a cleanlier shift then this to haue had
It hinder'd by command, he being a Lord,

But I will finde him.

Enter Lord PROVDLY.

Proud.
You see, valiant Sir, I haue got loose
Pro. stabs his sister.
For all your stratagem, oh rogue are you there.


Ing.
Most ignoble Lord.

Ingen stabs Proud. in the left arme.

Proud.
Coward thou did'st this
That I might be disabled for the fight,
Or that thou mightst haue some excuse to shun me,
But t'is my left arme, thou hast lighted on.
I haue no second; heere are three of you,
If all doe murther me, your consciences
Will more then hang you, damn you; come prepare.


In.
Brother walk off,  take the boy away, is he hurt much?


Bro.
Nothing or very little.

Fr. thrusts the Boy out.

Ing.
Ile bind your wound vp first, your losse of blood
May sooner make you faint.


Pr.
Ingen, thou art a worthy Gentleman, for this curtesie,
Go-too i'le saue thy life, come on Sir: hay,
a passe or two.
I'le cut your codpeice point Sir, with this thrust,
And then downe goes your breeches.


Ing.
Your Lordships merrie
passe.
I had like to haue spoild your cut-worke band.

Enter MAID like a foote-boy running, BROTHER
after him, Maid kneeles betwixt 'em.

Maid.
Oh Master, hold your hand, my Lord hold yours,
Or let your swords meete in this wretched breast,
Yet you are both well, what blood you haue lost
Giue it as for the iniurie you did, and now be friends,


Pr.
S'hart, t'is a louing rogue.


Ing.
Kind Boy, stand vp, t'is for thy wound he bleeds,
My wrong is yet vnsatisfied.


Pr.
Hence away it is a Sisters losse, that whets my sword.


Mai.
Oh stay, my Lord, behold your sister heere
discouers her selfe.
Bleeding by your hand Seruant see your mistresse
Turn'd to thy seruant running by thy Horse,
Whose means it was to haue preuented this, but all in vaine.


Broth.
Oh noble Ladie.


Ing.
Most worthie patterne of all women kind.


Proud.
Ingen, I am satisfied, put vp your sword.

Sister, you must with me, I haue a husband
The Lord Fee-simple father, old, but rich:
This Gentleman is no match for you; kneele not,
That portion of yours, I haue consum'd,
Thus marrying, you shall neuer come to want.


Maid.
Oh I seet my Lord, my brother do not force me,
To breake my faith or to a loathed bed.


Ing.
Force you, he shall not, brother beare her hence,
Shee is my wife, and thou shalt finde my cause
Ten times improu'd now.


Pr.
Oh, haue at you Sir.


Ma.
Hold, hold for heauens sake, was e're wretched Lady
Put to this hazard? Sir, let me speake
But one word with him, and i'e goe with you,
And vndergoe, what euer you command.


Proud.
Doo't quickly, for I loue no whispering,
T'is strange to see you Madame with a sword,
You shoud haue come hither in your Ladies cloathes.


Maid.
Well, as you please my Lord, you are witnesse,
whatsoe're before
Hath past betwixt vs: thus I doe vndoe.
Were not I mad to thinke thou could'st loue me
That would'st haue slain my Brother?


Pr.
Sai'st true sister.


Ing.
Oh thou faire creature! wilt thou be as false as other
Ladies?


Maid.
Thou art my example,
Ile kisse thee once, farewell for euer, come my Lord, now
Match me, with whom you please, a tumbler.
I must doe this, else had they fought againe.

Exeunt.


Actus quintus.
Enter SVBTLE with HVSBAND.

Subt.
SHee is not to be cast.


Hus.
It cannot be: had you a wife, and I were in your
case.



Husb.
I would be hang'd euen at the chamber doore
Where I attempted, but i'le lay her flat.


Subt.
Why tell me truely, would it please you best,
To haue her remaine chast, or conquered.


Husb.
Oh friend it would do me good at the heart
To haue her ouer come, shee do's so brag
And stand vpon her chastitie forsooth.


Subt.
Why then in plaine termes Sir, the fort is mine,
Your wife has yeelded, vp-tailes is her song,
The deed is done, come, now, be merrie man.


Husb.
Is the deed done indeed? come, come, you jest,
Has my wife yeelded? is vptailes her song?
Faith come, in prose, how got you to the matte first, ha.
Pish, you are so bashfull now.


Subt.
Why, by my troth i'le tell you, because you are my
friend, otherwise you must note it is a great hurt to the art
of whooremasterie to discouer, besides the skill was neuer
mine o'th price.


Husb.
Very good, on sir.


Subt.
At the first she was horrible stiffe against me, then
Sir I tooke her by the hand, which I kiss'd.


Husb.
Good Sir.


Subt.
And I cal'd her pretie Rogue, and I thrust my fin|ger
betwixt her breasts, and I made lips; at last, I pul'd her
by the chin to me, and I kist her.


Husb.
Hum, very good.


Subt.
So at the first, she kist very strangely, close,  vn|toward;
then said I to her, thinke bt vpon the wrongs, the
intollerable wrongs, the rogue your Husband does you.


Hus.
I that was very good, what said she to you then sir?


Subt.
Nay, I went on. First quoth I, thinke how he hath
vsd you, left you no meanes, giuen all your clothes to his
Punckes, struck you, turn'd your gray eies into black ones,
but yet


Husb.
A preie conceit.


Subt.
Quoth I, these things are nothing in the Rascoll,
thinke but what a base Whoore-master, the Rascoll is.


Husb.
Did you call me Rascoll so often are you sure.


Subt.
Yes, and oftner, for said I, none comes amisse to

the rogue, I haue knowne him quoth I, doe three lowzie beg+gars
vnder hedges in the riding of ten mile, and I swore
this to.


Hus.
Twas verie well, but you did lie. On I pray.


Sub.
Pish, one must lie a little, now sir by this time shee
began to kisse some what more openly, and familiarlie, her
resistance began to slacken, and my assault began to stiffen,
the more her Bulwarke decai'd, the more my batterie forti|fied,
at last sir, a little fumbling being past to make the Con|quest
more difficult, shee perceauing my readines mounted,
fals me flat vpon her backe, cries mee out aloud
Ahlas I yeeld, vse me not roughly friend,
My fort, that like Troy towne, ten yeares hath stood
Beseig'd and shot at did remaine vnwon:
But now tis conquer'd. So the deede was done


Hus.
Then came the hottest seruice. Forward with your tale sir.


Sub.
Nay Caetera, quis nest, lassi requienimus ambo
Proueniant medii sic mihi sape dies.


Hus.
Which is as much to say: I am a Cuckold, in all Lan|guages,
but sure tis not so, It is impossible my wife should
yeeld.


Sub.
Hoyday, ene now, it was impossible she should hold
out, and now it is impossible she should yeeld, stay you but
heere  be an eare witnes to what followes, Ile fetch your
wife. I know he will not stay.
Exit.


Hus.
Good faith Sir but he will. I doe suspect some kna|uerie
in this.
Exit.
Here will I hide my selfe, when thought as gone,
If they doe ought vnfitting I will call
Witnesse, and straight way sue a diuorce.

Enter WIFE and SVBTILL.

Sub.
I knew hee would not ay. Now noble Mistrisse,
I claime your promise.


Wife.
What was that good seruan


Sub.
That you would lie with me.


Wife.
If with anie man,
But prithee first consider with thy selfe
If I should yeeld to thee, what a load thy Concence

Would beare about it, for I wish quick thunder
May strike me, If I yet haue lost the truth,
Or whitenesse of the hand I gaue in Church,
And twill not be, thy happinesse (as thou thinkst)
That thou alone should'st make a woman fall,
That did resist all else, but to thy soule
A bitter Corasiue, that thou didst staine,
Vertue that else had stood immaculate,
Nor speake I this, as yeelding vnto thee,
For tis not in thy power, wert thou the sweet'st
Of natures Children, and the happiest,
To conquer me, nor in mineowne to yeeld,
And thus it is with euery pious wife.
Thy daylie railing at my absent Husband
Makes me indure thee worse, for let him doe
The most preposterous ill relishing things
To me, they seeme good, since my Husband does 'em,
Nor am I to reuenge or gouerne him,
And thus it should be with all vertuous Wiues.


Sub.
Poxe a this vertue and this chastetie,
Doe you know faire Mistresse, a young Gentleman
About this towne cald Bould, where did he lie
Last night, sweet Mistris, oh oh, are you catch'd,
I saw him slip out of the house this morne,
As naked as this truth, and for this cause
I haue tould your Husband that you yeelded to me,
And he I warrant you, will blaze it throughly,
As good doe now then as bee thought to doe.


Wife.
No, twill not be yet, thou iniurious man,
How wilt thou right me in my Husbands thoughts,
That on a false surmise, and spight hast tould,
A tale to breed vncurable discontent?
Bould was that ould wench that did serue the Widdow,
and thinking by this way to gaine her loue
Mist of his purpose, and was thus cashier'd,
Nor cares shee to proclame it to the world.


Su.
Zoons, I haue wrong'd you Mistris. On my knees
kneels
I aske you pardon, and will neuer more,

Attempt your puritie, but neglect all things
Till that soule wrong I haue bred in your Knight
I haue expeld, and let your loues aright.


Hus.
Which now is done alreadie Madame wife,
kneeles
Vpon my knees, with weeping eies, heau'd hands,
I aske thy pardon, oh sweet vertuous creature,
I prithee breake my head.


Wife.
Rise, rise, Sir pray
You haue done no wrong to me, at least I thinke so;
Heauen hath preuented all my iniurie,
I doe forgiue and marrie you a new.
Come, we are all inuited to the weddings,
The Ladie Honor to the old rich Connt.
Yong Bould vnto another Gentlewoman,
We and the Widdow are inuited thither,
Embrace and loue, henceforth more really,
Not so like worldlings.


Husb.
Heere then ends all strife
Thus false friends are made true, by a true wife.

Exeunt.

To credit woman, nor no Ladie euer
To beleiue man, so either sexe shall rest

Oh, oh, oh, oh.


Wid.
Seruant, God giue you joy, and Gentlewoman,
Or Ladie as full joy, I wish to you,
Nor doubt that I will hinder you, your loue,
But heere am come to doe all curtesie
To your faire selfe, and husband that shall be.

wench as well.


Welt.
As well, as my Lord, nay by my faith, that you do
not, loue a yong wench as well as he, I wonder you will be
vnmannerly to say so.

Faith Master Wel-tri'd, troth is I loue them well,
but they loue not me, vm, vm, vm, you see, what ill luck, I

Where got you this cold my Lord? it can get in no

It got in at his eies, and made that birdlime there

worse then a Iustices lying with his own daughter, but M^r.
Wel-tri'd when will the Widdow breake this matter to me?


Welt.
Not till the very close of all, she dissembles it yet,
because my Lo your Father is heere, and her other suitor
Bould.

That's all one, he's o'th plot a my de:


Wid.
T'is needlesse Master Bould, but I will doe
Any thing you require to satisfie you,
Why should you doubt, I will forbid the banes,
For so your friend, heere tould me? I should rather
Doubt that you will not marrie.


Bo.
Madam by heauen, as fully I am resolu'd to marry now,
And will to, if you doe not hinder it,
As euer louer was, only because
The World has taken notice of some passage
Twixt you and me, and then to satisfie
My sweet heart heere, who poore soule is a feard,
To haue some publike disgrace put vpon her,

I doe require some small thing at your hands.


Wid.
Well, I will doe it and ths professe besides,
Married, you shall as welcome be to mee
As mine owne brother, and your selfe faire Ladie,
Euen as my selfe, both to my boord, and bed.


Wel.
Ah, ah, how like you that?

Her vitall functions not decaid a whit,
But haue their naturall life and operation.
My Lord, be cheer'd, I haue an ingredient about me,
Shall make her well I doubt not.
In Master Parson, it shall be yours I pray,
The soules Physition should haue still the way.

And still let the Physicion hold her by the hand.

Thou temporall Lord, perdy thou neuer shalt
Keepe me in jayle, and hence springs my reason,
My act is neither Felonie nor Treason.


Fee.
I sir, but you do not know, what kindred she may haue.


Omnes.
Come, come, there is no remedie.


Wife.
And weigh't right in my opinion my honor'd Lord,
And euery bodies else, this is a match,
Fitter ten thousand times, than your intent.


Omnes.
Most certaine t'is.


Wid.
Besides, this Gentleman your brother in law well
parted, and faire mean'd, and all this come about (you must
conceiue) by your owne sisters wit as well as his.


Ing.
Come, come, t'is but getting of me knighted my
Lord, and I shall become your Brother well enough.


Pr.
Brother your hand, Lords may haue projects still,
But there's a greater Lord, will haue his will.


Bo.
This is dispatcht. Now Madam is the time,
For I long to be at it, your hand sweet heart.


Feesi.
Now, boyes.


Wid.
My Lord, and Gentlemen, I craue your witnesse
To what I now shall vtter. 'Twixt this Gentleman
There has beene some loue passages and my selfe,
Which heere I free him, and take this Ladie.


Welt.
Law ye, and take this Ladie.


Wid.
Which with a mothers loue, I giue to him,
And wish all joy may crowne their marriage.



Bould.
Nay Madame, yet she is not satisfied.
Bould giues her a ring, and she puts it on her thumb.


Wid.
Further, before yee all I take this ring
As an assumpsit, by the vertue of which
I bind my selfe in all my lands and goods,
That in his choice, i'le be no hinderance:
Or by forbidding banes, or claiming him
My selfe for mine, but let the match goe on
Without my check, which he intendeth now.
And once againe I say, I bind my selfe.


Bo.
Then once againe, I say, widdow thou'rt mine
Priest marrie vs, this match I did intend,
Yee are all witnesses, if thou hinder it,
Widdow your lands and goods are forfeit mine.


Wid.
Ha, nay take me to, since there's no remedie,
Your Widdow (without goods) sels scuruilie.


Omnes.
Whoop, God giue you joy.


Count.
S'light, I am cozend of all sides, I had good hope
of the Widdow my selfe, but now I see euerie bodie leaues
me sauing vm, vm, vm.


Bo.
'Troth my Lord,  that will sticke by you I warrant.


Wid.
But how Sir, shall we salue this Gentlewoman?


Bo.
Hang her whoore.


Welt.
Fie, you are too vnciuill.


Feesi.
Whoore in thy face, I doe defie thy taunts.


Bo.
Nay hold faire Ladie, now I thinke vpon't.
The old Count has no wife, lets make a match.


Omnes.
If he be so contented.


Count.
With al my heart.


Bo.
Then kisse your Spouse.


Count.
S'foot she has a beard: how now, my sonne?


Omnes.
T'is the Lord Fee-simple.

[Feesi vnmasques.

Feesi.
Father, lend me your sword, you and I are made a
couple of fine fooles, are we not? If I were not valiant now,
and meant to beate 'em all, heere would lie a simple dis|grace

say to 'em, d'ee heare my Masters, Dam-me, yee are all the
sonne of a whoore, and ye lie, and I will make it good with
my sword, this is cal'd Roaring Father.

Let me see how many challenges must I get writ: You shall

Proud.
Nay, wee'le not now part angrie, stay the Feasts
That must attend the weddings, you shall stay.


Feesi.
Why, then all friends, I thought you would not
haue had the manners to bid vs stay dinner neither.


Husb.
Then all are friends, and Ladie, wife, I crowne
Thy vertues with this wreath, that 'tmay be said,
There's a good wife.

They set Girlnds on their heads.

Bo.
A Widdow.


Ing.
And a Maid.


Wife.
Yet mine is now approu'd the happiest life,
Since each of you hath chang'd to be a wife.

Exeunt.
