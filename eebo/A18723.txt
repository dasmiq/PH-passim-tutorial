Churchyardes farewell.
AS witte is neuer good
till it bee derely bought:
So frends vntill their truth be tride,
may passe for thinges of nought.
For frendship all in woordes,
a kinde of flattringe is.
And if I thinke my woorthiest frende
may be abusde by this,
I ought in plaine flat termes
to shewe him what I thinke,
And blaze the meaninge of my minde
by paper, pen, and Inke.
Because the doores be barde,
where my good will should pas:
And buzzinge Bes do crepe in place,
where Churcheyards credite was.
The fowlers mery pype
betraies the careles byrde:
And fleringe fawners lye in waite,
to geue their frends a gyrde.
When fortune turnes hir face,
beware the Syrenes songe:
Beware the busie Clawbackes fine
whose freendship lastes not longe.
Thinke you the flyes doo flocke
aboute the fleashe in vaine?
Dooth not the Be seeke out the flower
some hony there to gayne?
Doo courtiers all for loue,
approche the princes gates?
Dooth plainnesse in these double daies,
repaire to great estates?
No sure in maskinge robes
goeth mischiefe muffled nowe:
And subtile sleightes with snakish stings,
doo lodge in smilinge browe.
And your affections blinde,
hath you bewitched so,
Ye haue no power to finde your freendes,
nor to descerne your fo.
Ye fill the fleesinge fistes,
and let the needie lacke:
And sharpe their teeth whose crafty tungs
can byte behinde your backe.
I pray you tell me now,
if hap woulde let you slyde,
How many would through thick  thinne
for loue with you abide?
Perhaps a heape of suche
could hungry hangers on,
Whose nature geues the courte a fygge
when worldly hap is gon.
Can you not see the cause,
that bringes them swarminge in?
And where the whele of Fortune swayes,
the worlde fauour winne?
Had not your elders wise,
good triall of suche trashe?
Did you not se what woorthy wittes
at length were lefte in lashe:
By trustinge some to farre,
and heapinge hope in those
That seemed frends to outwarde sight,
and yet were secrete foes?
O let me licence haue
to painte these pecocks out,
Whose fethers wauereth with the winde
and so turnes taile aboute:
Yet flicker with their winges,
to faune the face awhile,
Untill their sodaine flight they take,
and so their frends beguile.
What should we iudge of them,
that stare in faces still:
Where lo, for all their curtsie great,
they beare but small good will.
And where they seldome come,
but when some sute they haue:
They make a signe to se my Lorde,
yet seeke by sleight to craue.
What makes them watch their howres,
and thrust in thickest preest.
It is for frendship that they beare
vnto a certaine lease.
My Lorde must helpe to get,
now crowche and knele they all:
Now stand they vp like sainctes in shrine,
or nayld against a wall?
Now figge they here and there,
as thornes were in their heles
Now trudge aboute these whirlegigges,
as worlde did runne on wheles.
Now cast they frendly lookes,
all ouer the chambers gaye.
Now geue they place as God were there,
now turne they euery waye.
Now talke they trimme in printe,
and prate of Robin hood:
Much like the knightes of Arthers courte,
that knew full well their good.
Some through a finer meane,
doo crepe in credites lappe:
And vale their bonettes by deuise,
as fauour folowed cappe.
Suche Iuglers bleare your eies,
and smile within their sleue:
When honour in his harmles moode
Dooth best of them beleue.
Were you but once a daye,
in simple seruauntes place,
And like a looker on ye stoode,
to prie vpon this case:
Then should ye throughly se,
who plaies the wily foxe:
And how the Wolfe can frame himselfe,
to draw in yoke like oxe.
Then shoulde the mufled men,
shew foorth their faces bare
And therby noble hartes shoulde learne
to knowe what flatterers are.
The glory of your state,
heaues vp your hed so hie:
That many thinges doo scape your vewe,
whiche we se full with eye.
And who is now so bolde,
that dare flat warninge geue,
To suche as in toppe of pompe,
or princely plasures lyue.
I muse what new founde chaunce,
hath so disguisde the state
That men oft times for speakyng plaine,
doo purchace endlesse hate.
Whilest fraude and fained chere
dooth euell honour fede:
And noman dare a plaister geue,
to heale the wounde in dede:
Full fickle shall you walke,
and neuer wante disease.
They should be banisht from your courte
that are so glad to please
With twittell twatlyng tales.
The truth like larm bell.
Should shortly sounde in tender eares
and learne you to doo well.
But sure the swetest nuttes
doo noorishe woormes apace,
And flatterers of the finest stampe,
in courte haue finest place.
I am to plaine therefore,
my penne hath drunke to muche?
An alie hed makes idle hande,
the quicke to nere to touche.
Nay, nay, some one must speake,
although the vice it be:
Or els the play were done ye wot,
then Lordinges pardon me.
For fre of euery Hance
I thanke the gods I am,
And serues no turne but for a vice,
since first to courte I came.
To make the Ladies laugh,
that leades the retchles liues
Who late, or neuer woodcocke like
at later Lammas thriues.
Yet if the foole had gotte,
at his departinge thence
A night cap, or a motley coate,
or els some spendinge pence.
It had bene well enough:
but nothinge there I founde
For nothinge from their budgets fell
they were so straitly bounde.
Ye lie sir Daw in dede,
canst thou so longe be there
But needes must fall into thy handes,
some paringe of the peare?
A hungry paringe Lorde
he hath that there doth weight:
He watcheth like a gredy hounde
that standeth at receight:
That oft for lacke of gme,
runnes home his panche to fill
Or sterues in forest or in parke,
at least at kepers will.
Looke what to courte he brought
it is consumed and gone
And there the fleash of euery iointe,
is worne vnto the bone.
The carraine crowes of Cheape
in steyng bones so bare
Would clap the fell in counter too,
to breede him further care.
Nay fie on such good hap,
on Souldiers faith I sweare:
To sell the Courts and Cittie bothe,
and he that takes me there.
Let him cut of mine cares,
and slitte my nose aright
And make a curtoll of the beast,
that hath a hed so light.
To linger out my yeeres
for moone shine in the well
A hood, a hood, for such a foole,
a bable and a bell.
A coxcombe is to good
for such a calfe I trow.
As of my Lorde my leaue I take,
so now againe I go.
Where fortune shall assigne,
my staffe to light or fall.
And thus I know a truer freende,
was not amonge them all.
Then to my power I was,
to you and all your race
Nor vnto whome I dayly wishe,
more blesse happe and grace.
 Churchyarde.
FINIS.
