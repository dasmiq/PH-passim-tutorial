The First Chapiter.
_IN the Begin|ing  of the Creation of Heauen and of Earth Gen. 1. a. and of the Garnishing of thesame  and of the Gen. 1. c. Man Adam, God opened or declared theThe Linial|dissent of the Passing-ouer of the Light vpon the Earth, from the Beginning til-vnto the Ende or Perfec|tion. First Thorowe-breaking of his true Light, vpon the Earth: and ther was not in Heauen nor on Earth nor with the Man, any|more but one Onelie Beeing of God: and that|same, knew by the Man nothing-els but Good / same also nothing-els but Good / and did also no|thing-els but Good.
2. But now besides thissame, the Man tooke on him Gen. 3. . to knowe that which hee knew not / to see, that hee sawe not / and to doo, that hee did not.

And thatsame which was nothing, was the Euell or Vngodlynes / which Sap. 1. b. 2. c the Man, in his Falling|away from God, fel-vnto / wher-through also, the|same Knowledge wrought in the Man, the Euell or That which is vngodlie / because hee knewe or vnderstoode not Thatsame which is nothing, as Nothing / and sawe not into it, as Nothing: but accepted thesame for Somthing / and vnderstood or conceaued thesame Knowledge, partlie for Good / and partlie for Euell.
3. And through thesame Science or Knowledg, the Man intermixed his Beeing and Memorie which were in all, Gen. 1. c. 2. a b. c. Good; with the Nothingnes or That which was nothing, being Gen. 3. a. b. voyde of Bee|ing and Life / which also was nether Nature nor Elementish / nether had it any Memorie or Vn|derstanding. And That was the Euell or Vngod|lynes, insteed-of or besides; y^e Good or that which is Godlie / the Death, insteed of the Life / the Lye, insteed of the Trueth / the Darknes, insteed of the Light / and the disobedient Knowledg which Gen. 3. a. b. the Serpent requireth, insteed of the Obedience which God requireth: and thesame disobedient Know|ledg, is the false Light / wherthrough Eccli. 37. a. the whole Worlde, is so becom repleanished with Falshod / and wherwith also the Man as consubstantiated; hath intermixed himself / and which also hath open|ed his Eyes, to his owne Self-seeking: and hee is ther-through becom seeing, of that which hee yet|notwithstanding sawe not / and knowing also, that which hee yet-notwithstanding knew not: and

euenso through thesame false Light of the disobedi|ent Knowledg, Adam tooke on him against God and the Requiring of his Woord; to be Gen. 3. . wyse and knowledgfull himself, as God: and euenso accor|ding to his taken-on Knowledg; hee knew both Good and Euell: hee sawe also Good and Euell: hee did likewise Good and Euell: and brought|fourth also Gen. 4. . good and euell Children.
4. See / euen-thus ther was with the Man, vpon the Earth / as-well Darknes, as Light / so|well Falshod and Deceit, as Singlemyndednes and Faithfulnes / and as-well Disobedience, as Obedience: So that by that occasion / ther was on the Earth, as-well Death, as Life: and the Chil|dren of Adam walked-fourth partlie singlemynd|edlie and obedientlie, in the Light / and were incly|ned Gen. 4. a. b. c to the Good: and partlie also subtillie / and de|ceitfull, in the Darknes / and were inclyned to the Euell: And those were the Fruites Gen. 3. a. of the Good and of the Euell / wherthrough the Iniquitie hath so ouer-measurablie 4. Esdr. 4. c. multiplyed itself euery-where, among the Children of Men.
5. Howbeit / the Good Fruites increased them continuallie, in the Light / and in the Obedience which God requireth: and the Euell Fruites in|creased them continuallie, in the Darknes / and in the disobedient Knowledg, according to the Requi|ring of the Subtil-prudentie of the Serpent. But the Euell Fruites Gen. 5. 6. a. augmented or increased them into many Multitudes vpon the Earth: So that the Euell Fruites became many-mo, in the Dark|nes / 

then the Good Fruites, in the Light. And so in processe-of-time, the Euell Fruites with the sub|till Knowledg in the Darknes, tooke-on to them the Dominion and Violent-power, vpon y^e Earth. And it had euenso his Fourth-going or Continu|aunce-of-course, till vnto Noe.
6. WIth Noe God declared vpon y^e Earth, the Seconde Thorowe-breaking of his true Light: and made with thesame Light, a Se|peration, Gen. 6. c. 4. Esdr. 3. b. betwixt the Good and Euell Fruites / and betwixt Those that liued according to the In|stitution Gen. 4. e. of Seth, and were of the right Stocke of the good Beeing of God / Gen. 6. b. and Them which had corrupted the Waye of the Fleash / and liued after the Lustes of their Concupiscence / and were of the Stocke or Rase of the Wicked.
7. Likewise, at thesame time of Noe, the Lorde destroyed all Fleash that had Gen. 6. b. 7 c corrupted his Way, in the Euell and in the Darknes. And so it became knowen and manifest / that the Feare of God, was or rested with the Gen. 9. a. b. c Good Fruites in the Light. and that ther was nothing but Feare of the Euell, with the Euell Fruites in the Darknes. And ther-out it proceeded, that the Euell / and the Degenerated fro~ their right Stocke, enterprised to make-them For|tresses-of-strength / and Gen. 11. a. sought their Honour and Preseruation through the Workes of their owne Handes. But God was the Strength and Pre|seruation of the Good.
8. And the Euell or Degenerated from their right Stocke, 4. Isdr. 3. b. multiplyed them againe into many

Multitudes / and into manifolde Generations vp|on the Earth. And the Lorde with his Good Fru|tes, reserued or kept vpon the Earth nomore but one Stocke or Generation Gen. 11. c. d. that feared Him / and liued according to his Lawe: and that was the Genera|tion of Sem, out of Noe. And it had euenso hys Fourth-going, till vnto Abraham.
9. WIth Abraham God declared, y^e Third  Thorowe-breaking of his true Light vpon the Earth: and made with thesame Light, a Disseuering or Cleere-distinction, Gen. 12. 13. b 14. b. 17. a. b. betwixt Hys People which Hee chose vnto him as peculiar, to an holie People; / and the many-maner of People and Generations of the Heathen. And God set his Couenant betwixt Him and his People / and made therwith a Difference, betwixt his People and the vncircumcised Heathen: and God increased and multiplyed his People the Seede of Abraham into Gen. 35. e. 49. a. b. c. d. twelue Generations or Trybes: and they dwelled in the Gen. 47. a. b Lande of Egipt, wher they Exod. 1. a. b were heald-in-subiection by the Wicked. And it had e|uenso his Fourth-going, till vnto Moses, Exod. 2. a. which releassed the Seede of Abraham, from that Vio|lent-power / Exod. 12. 13. 14. and lead them out of the Lande of Egipt.
10. WIth Moses God declared, the Fourth Thorowe-breaking of his true Light, vpon the Earth. and also manifested therby, which were his Exod. 19. 20. a. b. c. Ordinaunces / Lawe / and Rites, wher|in his People had alwayes liued / and who were the right Ministers of the Priestes-office of hys

Lawe. And Hee made euenso with thesame Lights a cleere Vnfolding, who they were that loued God and his Lawe or Ordinaunce / and beleeued Him. and who dispised Him  his Lawe or Ordinaunce / and beleeued not. And it had euenso his Fourth|going, till vnto 1. Reg. 3. Samuel, 1. Reg. 16. Dauid, and 3. Reg. 2. b. 5. b. Salo|mon the kinglie Seate of the godlie Maiestie / and till vnto Gods holie Propheates, vnder the Obedience of the kinglie Lawe of the Maiestie of God / and of the Ordinaunce of thesame Priesthod.
11. WIth Samuel, Dauid, and Salomon the kinglie Seate of the godlie Ma|iestie / and with Gods holie Propheates, vnder the Obedience of the kinglie Lawe of the godlye Maiestie / and of y^e Ordinaunce of thesame Priest|hod, God declared the Fifth Thorowe-breaking of his true Light, vpon the Earth. And Hee made knowen and manifest with thesame Light, y^e Seate of his godlie Maiestie: Also euidentlie expressed, who should buylde a Temple or Howse of hys Dwelling, 3. Reg. 5. b. 6. a. b. c. d. . a. b. c. for Him and his Name / and should possesse the Seate of his Maiestie, on the Earth: and who were meete for to minister the Priestes-of|fice / and to witnes-fourth his Woorde / and were sent of Him to that ende: and who were 3. Reg. 13. 18 d. c. 22. c. not meete for to minister the Priestes-office / and for to wit|nes-fourth the Woorde of the Lorde  nether-yet sent of Him. And that had euenso his Fourth-go|ing, till vnto the Destruction of Ierusalem, 4. Reg. 25. b. 2. Par. 36. c. d of the Temple of the Lorde / and of the kinglie Seate of the godlie Maiestie vpon the Earth. and till vnto

the kinglie Prince Zorobabel in Babilon.
12. WIth Zorobabel in Agg. 2.  Babilon, God declared the Sixth Thorowe-breaking of his true Light, vpon the Earth. And made with thesame Light a cleere Diuersitie, by whom his Vi|sion of Peace was / wherthrough the Citie of Ieru|salem and the 1. Esdr. 3. c. d 5. a. 6. a. b. Temple of the Lorde, should be buylded a-new / and the People of y^e Lorde brought againe ther-vnto: and by whom the Vision of Peace was hidden / and to whom the Darknes or Blindnes was com / wherthrough the People were lead-awaye, from the Vision of Peace / from 1. Esd. 8. 9. a 10. a. the Temple of the Lorde / and from their Lande-of-in|heritaunce ether Heritage; of God. as also were heald-captiue 2. Par. 33. b. in Babilon, and liued in a confused Intanglement: in such-sort / that they by that oc|casion; were scattered so far-abrode in the forraine Regions / that they were not all brought againe, to their Land-of-inheritaunce of God: but many of them remained dispersed in the straunge Countries / wheras they could not beholde the holie Psal. 137. . Citie Ie|rusalem, nor the Temple of the Lorde / nor-yet the Stoole or Seate of the godlie Maiestie  nether-yet offer-vpp or bring their Oblation and Guiftes to y^e Lorde, in his Sanctuarie  nor sing their Songes of Sion. And it had euenso his Fourth-going till vnto Math. 1. b. Luk. 1. c. 2. a. Iesus Christ, in the Passe-ouer of his Suf|fering and Math. 27. c. Luk. 23. c. Death of the Crosse, to the Entraunce into his Glorie Mark. 16. b. Luk. 24. f. Act. 1. b. at the Right-hand of God his Father, in the heauenlie Beeing: from whence Hee powred-fourth Act. 2. a. his holie Spirit on his Disciples / 

To thende that they through thesame holie Spi|rit; should Iohn. 15. c. Act. 1. b. be his Witnesses  and euenso publish to the People of the Lorde, their Releassing / and the Mercie-seate of the godlie Maiestie. and that thesame was Act. 10. 17. c. for to com vnto them from the Right-hand of their God; vpon the Earth. as also that God at thesame time; wolde iudge the whole Earth with Righteousnes.
13. WIth thesame Iesus Christ and hys  Witnesses, God declared the Seuenth Thorowe-breaking of his true Light, vpon the Earth: and made with thesame Light, a Diuersitie or sencible Notice, with whom the vpright Iohn. 8. c. Act. 1. b. 10. d Faith of Abraham, and the Annointing of the holie Gost, was: who were the right Children of Abraham: and who acknowledged Iesus Christ, Act. 2. d. 3. c. 4. 5. c. to be their Lorde / King / and cheef Priest / as also followed-af|ter Him, vnder the Obedience of the Beleef: And Hee manifested euenso through thesame Beleeuers, that Hee the God of Heauen wolde in the appoin|ted Daye of the Comming of Iesus Christ; Act. 17. d. iudge the whole Earth with Righteousnes  and reueale and set-vpp againe the Esa. 16. b. High-seate of his godlie Maiestie, vpon the Earth.
14. And these Beleeuers in Iesu Christ, and those that in such-sort confesse or acknowledg Him according to the Trueth, are the true and holie ca|tholicke Church of Iesu Christ, vnto the which all Heathen and Math. 3. a. 9. b. 11. c. Act. 2. d. 3. c. 10. c. 13. d. c. 15. c. c. sinfull Men to Repentaunce for their Sinnes / and to their Iustification from the|same; are called and bidden, through the Beleef or

Fayth of Iesu Christ.
15. All which verelie from the time-fourth of the Apostles of Christ; came-to-passe, to the Salua|tion of the Gentiles / and of all sinfull Men, which beleeued in Iesus Christ, and repented them / to the|ende that they mought Act. 2. d. 3. c. constantlie perseuer vnder the Obedience of the Fayth of Iesu Christ; in the Repentaunce for their Sinnes  and so prepare them redie against the Comming of their Lorde Ie|sus Christ. and that they mought euenso in the to|comming Daye of the righteous Act. 10. 17. d. Iudgment of God; be preserued vnto Godlines. and becom Math. 8. b. 25. d. Ephe. 2. b. c. Co|heyres in the Promises and Testamentes of the holie Fathers; with Israel and Iuda. And it had euenso his Fourth-going, till vnto the Falling-a|sleape of the Holyons of Iesu Christ.
16. AFter which Falling-asleape of the Holy|ons  of Iesu Christ, the false Christians / together with all Iniquitie and Abhomination of Desolation euenlike as the holie Propheat Dan. 8. 9. c. Math. 24. b. Luk. 2. c. Da|niel, and also Christ and his Witnesses, had fore|spoken therof; are entred-in besides the Church of Christ, vpon the Earth: and haue euenso vpon the Earth, vtterlie laid-wast the true Holie of y^e Church and of the Tabernacle of Iesu Christ. also caused the daylie Oblation in the Holie which serueth or cometh-to-passe to the Forgeeuing and Purging of Sinnes; / and the true God-seruice which extend|eth to the Renewing of the Inward-man; to ceasse or leaue-of. and in the Place of the Sanctuarie of God, set-vpp the Math. 24. b. 2. Tess. 2. b. Abhominations of Desolation / 

as also obtained the Victorie ther-withall: wher|through also among Many; the right Loue to God and to their Neighbour, Math. 24. a. waxed-colde in e|uery-behalf. And this hath had euenso his Fourth|going, till that the Lord out-of his mercifull Loue; raysed-vp Iere. 13. b. the gratious Woorde, according to his Promises / and elected HN therto, for to minister thesame, vnder the Obedience of his Loue / to the Ree~recting or Restoring of his true Sanctuarie / and of y^e true Offering and Godseruice in thesame.
17. Through which gratious Woord and HN, God reuealed the Appeering of the Comming of his Christ, and the Act. 17. d. New Daye of his righteous Iudgment / as also the Flowing-fourth of his ho|lie Spirit of Loue, to the Awaking 1. Tess. 4. b. and Rysing|vp of all his Holyons, out-of the Sleape / Sap. 3. a. Math. 19. d. 2. Tess. 1. a. to their Glorious-lordlynes with Iesus Christ, and to an euerlasting fast-standing Esa. 9. a. Dn. 2. e. 7. c Apo. 12. 21. a. Kingdom of the godlie Maiestie, vpo~ y^e Earth / according to his Promises.
18. EVen-thus hath God declared with HN, the Eight Thorowe-breaking of his true Light, vpon the Earth / wherin the Lorde the God of Heauen restored the former Kingdom with his Garnishing / together with all that Act. 3. c. which God hath spoken from the Beginning of the Worlde, through the Mouth of his holie Propheates / and of the Euangelistes of his Christ: and thesame Eight Thorowe-breaking of the true Light of God vpon the Earth, is the New Daye / to the Renew|ing of the Life / which God hath to-fore appointed, to reueale thesame in the last Time / for to Act. 17. d. iudge

THe Man, which God in the Be|ginning  made on Earth; of the Earth or of the Dust of the Earth, is Naturall / and Gen. 1. . 1. Cor. 15. . Earthlie: and is appeered vpon the Earth, visible and capable or feeleable.
2. But the Man which God procreated, out of the holie Spirit of his godlie Nature  and out of his euerlasting Eternitie, is 1. Cor. 15. . Spirituall / and Hea|uenlie: and is Math. 11. c. 1. Cor. 2. b. 15. c. inuisible and vncapable before all Eyes of the earthlie Men; vpon the Earth: but well to be seene and fealt, by all such as are spiritu|all and heauenlie, in the heauenlie Beeing.
3. THe Man of the Earth, fayleth Gen. 3. a. b. and chaungeth: and hys Light bydeth not firme vniformelie, in one-maner of Cleernes, euer|lastinglie.
4. The Man of Heauen, doth neuer faile nor chaunge: and his Light bideth firme of vniforme|beeing in his Cleernes, euerlastinglie.
5. A Womanlie Vessell Gen. 3. a. or Bodie, is begot|ten-with-childe of one Father and of one Seede of thesame Father, with two-sondrie Men of God / for to bring-fourth thosesame on y^e Earth: namelie / for to bringfourth the One Man of God, visible before all Eyes of the Fleash. also heareable with all Eares of the Fleash: and to bring-fourth the Other Man of God, Iohn. 3. a. 1. Cor. 15. c. inuisible before all Eyes of the Fleash / and also vnheareable with all Eares of the Fleash: But-yet sufficientlie to be seene with all Eyes of the Spirit. and to be hearde with all Eares of the Spirit, in the godlie Trueth and vp|right Righteousnes.

7. The Other Man of God which is not borne visiblie before the Eyes of the Fleash / but be|fore all Eyes of the Spirit; appeereth and inlarge|eth him ouer fewe, with fewe, and in fewe People, vpon the Earth: and is likewise seene and heard by Fewe vpon the Earth: Howbeit, hee is seene and heard aboundantlie and in great Glorie, of many, by many, and in many spirituall People, in the hea|uenlie Beeing.
8. The Man of God which is created or

brought-fourth visiblie before all Eyes of y^e Fleash; hath in much Seruice and Feruent-diligence or Labour; the Fore-going to the Entraunce of the e|uerlastingVid Gen. y. de Iacob  E|sau. Life. But-yet hee himself inheriteth not thesame / nether is hee also any Sonne-of-inheri|taunce in thesame euerlasting Life.
9. The Second Man which is inuisible, be|fore all Eyes of the fleashlie Mindedons; is with|out Labour; made an Heyre in the euerlasting Life: and remayneth a Sonne-of-inheritaunce eternallie, in thesame euerlasting Life. And out of thatsame e|uerlasting Life, hee manifesteth vpon the Earth, the Kingdom of the God of Heauen, full of all pure Bewtie: and remaineth eternallie Iohn. 17. a. consubstantiated or of-vniforme-beeing with the Deitie as-well vp|on Earth as in Heauen; in one-maner of Cleernes.

13. But they that are of the Earth  and earthlie of Beeing and Nature / Iohn. 3. d. and set all their Lust / Ioye / and Comfort, on the earthlie Thinges / Those contemne the 1. Cor. 2. b. heauenlie Blessing, in his sweete and peaceable Life and eternall Ioye.



The Thirde Chapiter.
THe First Heauen and the First  Earth were very goodlie, Gen. 1. d. bewtifull, and sumpteouslie-garnished: howbeit thesame chaunged / and the Cleernes and Garnish|ing of thesame, bid not permanent in the Sight of Men: but it 2. Pet. 3. b. Apo. 21. a. vanished-away from their Eyes, so that they behelde not thesame any-more.
2. The New or Seconde Heauen / Esa. 65. b. 2. Pet. 3. b. Apo. 21. a. and the New Earth, excelled the First or Former in Bew|tifulnes and Gorgeous-garnishing; far-away / and the Cleernes and Garnishing of thesame, remained standing and immutable in their exquisite Bewtie and perfect Righteousnes; euerlastinglie.
3. THe God of Heauen, hath garnished the Place of his Dwelling and his Christes on Earth, with Righteousnes / and hath sowen the Seede of the good Corne in his Fielde. Math. 13. c. But the nuious Man or Gods Aduersarie, hath ther|against, laid-wast or ruinoussed the Place of God and Christ on the Earth / and hath sowen y^e Seede of the Weede insteed of the Seede of the good Corne; in the Lordes Fielde.
4. Now when the Haruest Math. 13. d. was great  and the Corne together with the Weede, waxen-rype aboundantlie / then had the hungrye Men, no Lust to the Corne: Ier. 23. d. . Ezech. 13. b. but they grew at contention and firiued verye-much one-with-another; about the Weede / and about the Strawe of the Fielde: and wolde needes prepare them out of the Weede,

Bread for to liue-by.
5. THer went-fourth a Woorde / Winde / or  Spirit, from God euen vnto the Earth / for to iudge the Earth / and Them that dwelt vpon the Earth, according to the Esa. 28. b. Ballaunce of Equitie. But at thesame tyme, many Men became chaun|ged vpon the Earth: For many that were waxen|olde, lost their Elderdom / and 4. Esdr. 6. c. chaunged into Chil|dren / as-though they had ben but then newlie borne or brought-fourth.
6. The Children which were but euen-newlie borne / and altogether Esa. 29. 32. a without Vnderstanding, chaunged into Olde-men: and they witnessed in all Lauding of the Lorde; the Iudgment and the Mercie, vpon the Earth.
7. That which was 4. Esdr. 6. c. full, became emptie / and that which was emptie, became full / or was filled aboundantlie.
8. The Liuing became Dead: Psal. 55. b. 73. b. c. and the Dead became Liuingons.
9. THat which sat in Honour and was coun|ted for blessed, came to Eccli. 10. b. Reproch / and passed into the Condemnation.
10. That which was in Dishonour / and con|temned as Infelicious, Eccli. 10. b. came to great Honour / Glorie and Renowme / and went into the eternall Life.
11. THe Eloquent suffred Shipwrack in their  Tounges / and became as Domb-men: and the Dombe, Esa. 35. a. b. Sap. 10. c. became very-prompt or redie to speake / and were eloquent.
12. That which seemed, as-though it should al|wayes indure  or that it was not to be broken, be|come al-to-broken: and thatsame which was bro|ken / Ezech. 17.  and that men scarcelie beleeued that it coulde be made-whole againe or ioyned together, into One / ioyned itself together againe / and became One / and was perfect. And the Wisdom appeered or gaue-sourth herself very sweetlie and louelie, to Fruitfulnes / for to beare or bring-fourth the vp|right and good Fruites, vpon the Earth.

14. The Calling-voyce and seruiceable Mini|stration, to the Saluation and Welfare of all the Children of Men, cryeth on the Earth; out of the Habitation of the Oldest Mother and her Chil|dren / and sayth:
15. COm-in hether Pro. 1. c. to my Habitation, all yee  Generations of Israel, and Children of Iuda: For heere in my Habitation, is the holie Si|on, Esa. 2. a. Mich. 4. 2. wher-out now in the last Time, the Lawe of Life proceedeth. as also the true Ierusalem, wher|out now in the last time, the Woorde of the Lorde floweth-fourth / to the Setting-vpp and Establish|ing of you all, in your vpright Stock of Abraham.
16. COm-in hether to my Habitation, thou whole Christianitie / together with yee all that hope on Messias or Christ, and haue an Inclination to the Obedience of the Requiring of his Doctrine. For heere in my Psal. 132. b. Habitation or Dwelling, the true Messias or Christ, hath hys Shape and Safe-mating. also the vpright Beeing or Efficatie of his Righteousnes / and the Woord of his Life. For-that-cause ther is heere lifewise the Out-flowing of his holie Spirit of Trueth / of Love / and of Mercie. with which Spirit, Hee lea|deth his People, Iohn. 14. c. 16. b. into all Trueth / Loue /  Mer|cie: and into all Concorde and Peace.
17. Out of this my Habitation, becometh also now in the last time; the true Math. 24. b. Euangelie of the

Kingdom, published vnto you: and the synceere A|postolicall Doctrine of Iesu Christ, is also euen out of Loue; heald-fourth before you / for to renew you all in your Vnderstandinges, to an vpright Knowledg of the Trueth of God and Christ. and to 2. Pet. 1. a. pluck you all vnder the Obedience of the Loue, to all your Concorde and Peace, in Iesu Christ.
18. For-that-cause com-in hether all now to my  Habitation, yee all which are estraunged from Christ, Ephe. 4. b. and from his safe-making Doctrine / and that are plucked and bound through manifolde Discorde; in a straunge Yoake / wherwith yee sup|pose to haue the Verytrue [namelie / yee all that walke in manifold Diuistons, in straunge Yoakes.] For heere in my Habitation, is the true Beeing / and the vpright Ordinaunce of the godlie Life / vnto the which all Men are created and elected of God.
19. Com-in hether to my Habitation, all yee Kinges / Pro. . a. Princes / and Magistrates / together with all yee Rulers of Countries and People: and be you all renewed in your Estate or Condition, vnder the Obedience of the Loue. For heere in this my Habitation, yee may obtaine the right kinglie Scepter / for to gouerne well and vprightlie / and to prepare all Peace and Concord, on the Earth. For heere is the vpright Seate of the kinglie Maiestie / together Sap. 6. a. with the vpright Lawes / Ordinaunces / and Politike-orders-of-gouernment / for to vpholde therwith all Countries and People, in Peace.
20. Com-in hether to my Habitation, all yee Wyse / Scripture-learned / and Teachers / together

with all yee Philosophers / Poetes / and Maisters|of-science: and let all your Vnderstanding / Artes and Cunning becom renewed, vnder the Obedience of the Loue. For heere in my Habitation, is the o|uerflowing Esa. 12. a. Pro. 13. b. Eccli. 1. a. Fountaine of all Wisdom / and the very-right Ground and Style of all good Scien|ces and deep-grounded Vnderstandinges.
21. Com-in hether to my Habitation, all yee  vulgare People / of what Vocation or Trade-of|dealing so-euer yee be / and in what Ordinaunce so|euer yee liue and are instructed. For heere in my Habitation, yee finde the vpright Ordinaunce of all thinges, that are right and resonable. and the Pro. 1. 2. 3. 4. vp|right Doctrine and Information of all Vnder|standinges: wherin yee together one-with-ano|ther, may be taught, nurtered, and kept, peaceablie and concordablie  as also becom instructed  taught aright in al-thinges, how yee ought to liue both be|fore God and Man.
22. Com-in hether to my Habitation, all yee Sinners both Men and Women / and all yee Diseased or Infirme-parties / and also all yee Hea|then and estrayed People / together with all yee which dwell in Darknes. For heere in my Habita|tion, is the Heb. 5. a. Apo. 21. a. Seate-of-grace and the euerlasting Remission of Sinnes / the right Phisick, to the Curing or Health of the Diseased and Weake / and also the true Apo. 21. b. Light of the Lambe of God / and the permanent Cleernes of y^e holie Spirit of Loue / to|gether with the Apo. 3. 2. a. Tree of Life  his good Fruites / for that yee should eate therof / and so liue for euer.
23. For-that-cause so com now in hether to my Habitation, all yee Louers of the Trueth of God and Christ, of what-sort of Ordinaunce and Re|ligion soeuer yee be: and let your Vnderstanding and your Zeale be renewed, vnder the Obedience of the Loue of Iesu Christ. For heere in my Habita|tion, is all Trueth of God and Christ, Iam. 1. . and the vpright Religion and true Godseruice / and ther-to the Fulnes of all spirituall and heauenlie Goods / and the immutable Math. 22. . Righteousnes and Holynes / as also the eternall Life.
24. THus com now all hether / and seperate  you fro~ all vnsent Preachers / and from all those which turne-away themselues from y^e Cry|ing-voyce  seruiceable Ministration of the Howse of Loue / or that resist thesame. For they haue not the Woord of the Lorde. They Ier. 7. c. . . 14. b. 23. d. Ezech. 13. b. Mich. 3. 2. preach Lyes vn|to you / and make you Seruantes to their vnfruit|full Doctrines. Esa. 3. b. They blynde your Vnderstand|ing / and make Ier. 5. c. 23. d. Ezech. 13. b. Abac. 1. b. Snares, in your Heartes: and with their goodthinking Reasons or Speaches / together with their Blaspheamie which they bring|in to the burdening of your Consciences, they take your Vnderstandinges captiue vnder the  Spirites Ephe. 2. 6. . that raigne in the Ayre / and euenso shut|to the Kingdom of the God of Heauens before you: and Math. 23. b. they themselues also com not therin.
25. But whoso com vnto mee, in my Habitati|on / those assemble them with Math. . b. Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob among all Gods Propheates / and Holyons of Iesu Christ, and among all the Righ|teous

and Faithfull which are risen-vpp; into the Kingdom of the God of Heauens / and inherit all the Apo. 21. 22. c Riches and Oramentes of his pure Bewtie and vpright Righteousnes.
26. With all which Holyons of God  Christ  and with all entred Beleeuers of the holie Spirit of the Loue of Iesu Christ, the Oldest Mother doth greatlie reioyce her: and shutteth with-out her Ha|bitation, all Apo. 21. 22. c Infidels and Enemies vnto the Loue and her Seruice: with-out which Habitation of the Oldest Mother and all Holyons of God  Christ, ther is not els-what to be inherited ether obtained, but all Math. 8. b. 5. d. Variaunce / False-witnessing / Miserie / and Calamitie / together with the eternall Damnation.
27. WHerfore / O all yee People (when yee  heare this my Voyce / and are called and bidden to com and enter in hether to this my Habitation) so make-speede to enter betimes into my Dwelling / and to humble you before my Loue / reuer that yee be caught and bewrapped, with any Infidelitie or Mistrust / also becom much-worsse or obstinate, through any malitious Imaginations or Surmisinges / and so be ouerwhelmed and vt|terlie swallowed vpp by the Blyndnes of the Apo|stated from the Trueth / and by the Destruction of the Vngodlie. and ereuer the Doore be locked-to / lst that yee lyke to the false Heartes Math. 23. b. Luk. 13. of the Scrip|ture-learned / and the foolish Math. 25. a. Virgins; remayne ther-without.
28. Thus be you now betimes counsailed to the best: and seeke no Life nor Vnderstanding in anye

other Habitation, then in the Habitation of God or Howse of the Loue / wherin also the Wisdom the Oldest Mother of all liuing Soules hath com|prised her Habitation. For whosoeuer seeketh anye godlie Life or holie Vnderstanding, with-out the|same Habitation / hee shall finde nether Life nor Vnderstanding / nor-yet likewise anye Trueth or Righteousnes. Therfore let eueryone take this ef|fectuallie to heart.


The V. Chapiter.
THer are many People found / which  out of their owne Spirit or Imagination of the Knowledg, are very diligent, for to recreate them in the growing Hearbes / and to eate the good Fruites. and yet in all their Diligence, they obserue not any difference of time. Therfore must the Wisdom demaund-question of the Wyse / and saye:
2. WHerfore do the People (I pray you) runne-abrode so diligentlie in the Field, in the Winter-time / for to see the Hearbes and Flowers growe / and to delight themselues in their Springing or Growing-vpp?
3. Who findeth in the barren-time of Winter, the sweet-smelling Cant. 2. . Flowers / and the Fruitfulnes of the Hearbes in the Fielde?
4. Who tasteth the good Tast of the Fruites of the Trees / whylst that the Spring-time doth yeat last / and that the Trees do but begin to blossom?
5. Who can beholde at Midnight in y^e Dark|nes; the Light of the Sunne?
6. Who soweth his Wheate-graine vpon the Stonie-flyntes / or vpon any Rocke / meaning to reape good Wheate therof, for his Foode?
7. Who cometh to the Ende of his Iournye /  ereuer that hee haue gon-thorowe the First-part therof? Or who is hee that perfeteth or maketh the Ende of any Worke / before that the Beginning therof be first wrought?
8. Who cometh into the Sanctuarie of God, ereuer Esa. 52. . Ezech. 44. a Ioel. 3. b. hee be circumcised / and with whom is the spirituall and heauenlie Most-holie erected / ereuer hee haue Heb. 9. b. c. perfourmed hys Sinne-offering and Death-offering in the Holie, vnder the Obedience of the Loue of Iesu Christ?
9. For / to take-in-hand to finish any-thing, be|fore the right tyme of the Beginning of the same, is vnprofitable Labour: and bringeth-in much vayne or vnprofitable Trauell.
10. COnsider: That which is for to com / that same cometh at his conuenient time. And when the Waye Esa. 40. 57. b. 62. b. Math. 3. a. Iohn. 1. c. is made eeuen / and the Streat playne / then may-men best-of-all and safe|liest walke theron.
11. HEe is a valiant Champion, which hath it easelie in his Power, vtterlie to destroy his Enemies / and yet-notwithstanding suffereth all Wrong at their handes / and can euenso tarye his tyme. For such-aone perceaueth in Vnderstan|ding, in what-sort that hee with small paine; can

ring his Enemies in subiection vnder him / and lucke or procure their Frindship vnto him.
12. FRom the tyme of Samuel fourth, the  Kingdom of the God of Heauens obtay|ed his Thorowe-breaking vpon the Earth / Math. 11. b, Luk. 16. b. till nto Iohn the Baptist or Washer with the Water of Repentaunce.
13. From the tyme of Iohn the Baptist fourth, the Kingdom of the God of Heauens, was Math. 3. a. Mark. 1. a. Luk. 3. a. pub|lished to be hard-at-hand / till vnto Iesus Christ.
14. With Iesus Christ became the Kingdom of the God of Heauens to be manifested, Math. 12. . Luk. 11. b. in his pure Bewtie and Cleernes, vpon the Earth. But the Earth Iohn. 1. b. could not yeat awaye with the same. For|that-cause, it must take his Luk. 24. . Act. 1. b. Dominion or Raigne with Iesus Christ; at the Right-hand of God, in the heauenlie Beeing / till that the Loue and Mer|cie, obtained their Thorowe-breaking vpon the Earth / Apo. 21. . and that the Kingdom of the God of Hea|uens, shewed-fourth itself in the true Loue; vpon the Earth / and euenso became glorious on y^e Earth.
15. In the true Loue, the Kingdom of Heauen  bydeth stedfast vpon the Earth; euerlastinglie, in perfection: and ther cometh with the same in y^e true Loue; the eternall Life, to the elected Holyons of God, vpon the Earth. but to the peruerse Worlde, her Ezech. 7. Math. 24. b. Ending. and to the Vngodlie / together with all such as contemne the Loue / and blaspheame her holie Spirit, the eternall Condemnation: and they shall be cast into the Apo. 20. b. 21. b. Bottomlesse-pit / and into the Fyre Math. 15. c. 25. d. 2. Pet. 3. b. Apo. 21. c. of Hell.
16. Whosoeuer then doth let-passe the Tyme of Grace wherin men may obtaine y^e Life of Peace; / and 2. Cor. 6. a. respecteth not the same Tyme, with his Prof|fering-fourth of Grace whylst that it is yeat pre|sent; Hee Esa. 49. b. 2. Cor. 6. a. neglecteth much Good / and forsaketh the purchasing of great Riches: and falleth euenso at the last, into manifolde Miseries / and into great Paine or Sap. 5. . Math. 8. b. 5. d. Smart of the Heart. But whoso lett|eth himself be infourmed and counsailed to the best, by the Wisdom / hee may well be comforted.
17. THer are Many to be found which vtter|lie  contemne y^e needfullest Riches wher|through they mought attaine to the . Pet. . b. good Dayes;: and applye them verye-diligentlie to compasse the Slyme of the Earth / wherthrough they pluck vpon their owne Neckes, great Pouertie and extreame Miserie.
18. And albeit that they liue in all Pouertie and Miserie / yet are they notwithstanding in that their Miserie; of good-cheere and light-hearted / and becom thrto very Ier. 4. d. subtill and craftie, in all|maner of Wikednes and Falshod.
19. A Man may also finde many People, which dispise no Riches of God / and which also wolde gladlie enter into the Kingdom of God and Howse of Loue / and wyan or procure other-moe thervn|to: But ther are Fewe that prepare themselues vprightlie thervnto. and yet many fewer, that do before all; indeuour them obedientlie, for to becom fruitfull Iohn. 15. . in the holie Worde of Loue / and then e|uenso, to wyne or allure Other-moe to the Loue / 

and so to increase the Kingdom of the Loue, in all Concorde and Peace.
20. A Selfwyse-bodye / or a good-thinking foolish Man whether that hee haue much Knowledg or little; Esa. 5. a. 1. Cor. 1. 3. . Apo. 3. b. is a poore ignorant Creature / that is Ephe. 2. a. without God in this World: and whosoeuer will not be counsailed by the Wis|dom, through her Seruice of Loue / hee cometh-to|nothing, in his Good thinking.
21. When any-man reprooueth a self-wyse or  good thinking Man, of his Foolishnes / and wolde euenso teach and infourme him aright / as also stirre him forward into the right Waye of Life / then smyteth Pro. 9. b. and  hee / also frowneth  murmur|th / and spweth-fourth against his Maister or Teacher, all Poyson / Bitternes / and false Testi|monies: but whoso proyseth him in his Follie / him doth hee commend for a Wyse-man.
22. I haue seene with myne Eyes / that ther was a wise Man pressed-downe, in the most-con|temnedst Place / and that hee also laye 1. Cor. 4. b. to a Foote|wispe  Treading-steppe; vnder euerymans Feete: and very fewe receaued his Testimonies / and tooke his Contempt to heart. But I saw him stand-vpp with the Righteous / and that hee appeered in the Glorie of the Lorde: and became therin so mightie, that all Presumptuous-pride was constrayned to submit itself vnder him.


The VI. Chapiter.
THe Worlde with her Children and  Wyse, haue among them Three deceaue able Thinges / vnto the which they  or stande-addicted exceedinglie: and yet notwithstanding, they fall ther-through often|times, into great Miserie and Heauynes-of-minde / and are greeuouslie seduced therby:
2. The One is / that they beleeue vnnatural Thinges / or som Natural-thing to com-to-passe without y^e right Course or Ordinaunce of Nature or which is not in the power of the Elementes or o the Nature for to doo. And those manifolde vayn Foythes, cause such Variaunce  Diuision among the People / and do breede also with Many, a false Opinion and great Errour.
3. An Other is / that they indeuour them to ob|taine / and hunt or labour after somthing, which seemeth-good to themselues / and that also is not in their Goodthinking or Opinion; Pro. 33. . to be attayned|vnto of them. And thatsme breedeth among the People, manifolde Heauynes-of-minde and Dis|paire. as also manifolde Entraunces of Errours.
4. The Thirde is / that they afflict themselues with sorrowe aboue-measure / for that they are not able to get those Thinges, which they out of their Goodthinking; hunt-after or labour-for / but must misse or go-without thesame. This is assuredlie, a deceitfull Thing / that Men for those vayne Thinges cause; bring themselues into great Hea|uynes-of-minde and into much Miserie. And that|same worketh at the last through Luk. 21. c. Infidelitie and

Doubtfulnes; a greeuous State-of-confusion / and n Estraying of Mindes, among many People.
5. I Haue seene vpon thissame Earth, that  ther were wicked Men / which bruted or defamed the good and singlemynded Men / as like|wise the godded or illuminated Elders in the Ser|uice of Loue, with Math. 5. . 1. Pet. 2. c. 3. b al-maner of Wickednes: and made vnto themselues ther-withall, a Pretence or Shewe of Iustice. Thatsame is surelie a great and haynous Falshod vpon the Earth.
6. I haue also seene that wicked Men made-vp themselues with false Matiers; against y^e Sap. 2. b. c. Righ|teous and their iust Matiers or Causes: and haue euenso with false Matiers; pleaded their cause in the Lawe, against the Righteous and their iust Matiers: and Esa. 1. . Ier. 5. 22. b. Ezech. 22. b. oppressed euenso iniuriouslie with subtill Prudentie, in y^e Lawe; the righteous Men / and their iust Matiers. And I sawe that the Iudges themselues did not perceoue so-much / ne|ther-yet tooke they the Matiers to heart. And thatsame is among the Children of Men, a detest|able Abhomination.
7. Ther are likewise to be found vpon the Earth, many Wrooters / which haue y^e nature of Swyne / and do alwayes resembling the Swyne; go-on|fourth with their vnwashed Srowtes, wrooting or moyning ouer the Earth / and couet very gladlie, euery-wheare, whersoeuer they can finde or sent a|ny Dirt or Filthynes; to wallowe in the Dirt and Filthynes: yea and generallie, they also desire to continew them very-gladlie in thesame Nature.

For although they should be washed or that one desired to wash them / yet regarde they not for-al|that; the Fairnes / but Pro. 26. b. 2. Pet. 2. b. wallowe euen alike-well a|gaine in the Dirt and Filthines. For their Lust standeth not to any other thing.
8. Ther are also found vpon the Earth, High|flyers /  which resembling the Eagle; will Pro. 23. a. flie-vpp euen to the Skye: and so through their high Fly|ing; they gather many deadlie Windes: and bring euenso with their Winges; thesam noysom and deadlie Windes, on the Earth / wherout manye Men are brought to death / and so dye therof in their Sinnes / and perrish with the Vngodlie of the wicked Worlde. And yet those Flyers perceaue it not: nether do they likewise vnderstand what is most requisite or needfull for the Children of Men vpon the Earth; for to liue-by.
9. I haue seene moreouer, that the Feathers of many of those High-flyers, grew-about cleene-con|trary as from their Tyle vpward towardes their Head; / and that they forthatcause-sake, could not with their Winges; laue or make anye-more Winde, wherwith to flie on-high: but whiuered or fluttered heere-  -theare nigh vnto the Ground / and were in their Flying and Gathering of Winde; al|together without might: and remained euenso crea|ping and flapping with their Winges, vpon the Earth. Wherthrough many lost their Great-repu|tation, on the Earth / Ier. 4. d. e. Soph. 3. b. and could not preiudice or indamage the Men anymore, with their deadlie Windes.
10. Ther is a Dan. 2. . vehement and blustering Winde fallen-downe from Heauen, euen vnto the Earth / wherthrough all such as dwell vpon the Earth, are greatlie Ier. 50. 51. b. striken with Feare. Yea the Lyons in the Wildernes are ouer-taken therthrough with excee|ding great Feare: so that by that occasion, all their Might and Stout-courage faileth them / and they haue not any-more Lust, Ezech. 22. c. to deuour any liuing Beastes: but they Esa. 11. 65. d feede much-rather with the Oxen / and eate Strawe.
11. THe Wisdom and the Loue which haue  the smallest Estimation and are lest-of-all regarded on the Earth; practised their Skyll, vpon the Earth / and prepared against the last Tyme wherin all Destruction and Falshod maketh-vpp itself; an vncorruptible Arke vpon the Earth / to an euerlasting Preseruation of y^e Generation of Man|kinde [namelie / for the Remnant, the Righteous|ons] in the Perrishing of the last wicked Worlde / which is 1. Iohn. 5. . full of Iniquitie / and shall be 2. Pet. 3. b. consumed with Fyre.
12. Which vncorruptible Arke, is not made of Wood / nor-yet laide-ouer with Pitch, for that it mought therby fleete or swymme on the Waters / like-as was the Arke in the time of Noe; Gen. 6. . when the former wicked World perrished: but it is made and prepared of the most-syne Apo. 21. b. Golde / for to as|semble and keepe-safe there-in, all Soules of pure Heartes / and to reserue them to a Remnant vp|on the Earth, in the Perrishing or Going-vnder of the last wicked World / 2. Pet. 3. b. which shall be consumed

or burnt with the Fyre.
13. For that cause now (namelie / to the Preser|uation  of all vpright Heartes, in the Perrishing of the peruerse Worlde) hath the Wisdom and the Loue, very cunninglie made or prepared thissame Arke, of the Cant. 1. c. most-syne Golde / To thend that the|same and all Such as enter or are comprehended therin, may without damage; remaine-ouer from the Burning of the Fyers Vehementie, 2. Pet. 3. b. Heb. 10. c. whertho|rough the last wicked Worlde shall perrish.
14. THe North Windes arose with a great and boysterous Tempest / and fell with great Force into the Sea / and vpon the Earth: in such-sort / that the Sea was aboue measure; excee|dinglie troubled, with thesame Windes: Yea so troubled and chafed, that the Waues of the Sea arose and beate so mightelie against each-other / that all the Ship-maisters on the Sea, fead with their Shippes; to the Lande / for to sucker or preserue their Lyues on the Earth.
15. Howbeit, with thesame North Windes and great boysterous Tempest / ther became Seuen hel|lish Dragons with great Might and Dominion; soring or whiuering euery-wheare ouer the Earth / and spetfourth ouer all Landes, much terrible Fyre / with many cruell Fyre-flames / to the Destroying of the Men which dwelt vpon Earth.
16. This terrible Fyre with his cruell Fyre|flames, made such a dreedfull Burning / and a ter|rible Cracking of burning. and all Men / Foules / and Beastes, made so great a Chritch and horrible

Crye / that many Ship-maisters on the Sea, were so exceedinglie astonyed and striken with feare / that they durst not approch to any Countrie of the whole Worlde: but chose much-rather to suffer Ship|wrack in the Sea / and so to perrish / then to turne|them to that great Calamitie and Miserie of the Earth / and so to be swallowed-vp through the ter|rible Fyre of the hellish Dragons.
17. This is doubtles; the extreamest Apo. 8. 9. b. Woe in the Sea and vpon the Earth; of all the Woes that shall fall ouer the Vngodlie / in the dreedfull great Esa. 13. a. Ioel. 2. a. b. Soph. 1. b. Mal. 4. a. Apo. 6. b. Daye of the Lorde and of his righteous Iudgment.


The VII. Chapiter.
ISRAEL and IVDA were in tymes|past  so bewtifull Virgins / that the great King the Lord of all tooke them vnto him in Wed|locke / to his beloued Wiues: and set euenso all his Loue 2. Para. 9. . Psal. 67. 114. a. 135. a. Esa. 19. 66. a. Iere. 2. a. and Heartes-lust on Them.
2. Hee adourned them with all costlie Iewels  Bracelets wrought Ezech. 16. of al-maner of Golde-worke / and with the most-costlye Pearles and pretioust Stones: and made them euenso very gorgeous and glorious, aboue Oze. 14. c. all the Women and Vir|gins of the Heathen.
3. Hee begat also by them many faire Children: They brought-fourth likewise vnto him exceeding faire Daughters / which Hee much-esteemed and set great-store by: so that Hee also promised to geeue

vnto them in Mariage, his onlie Sonne / which sa vpon his Seate with Him / and raigned with Him in his Kingdom / and which also was his Hyre in all his Riches / If they behaued themselues ho|nestlie / and turned not themselues to any-maner of Whordom.
4. And according heervnto, so were the Daugh|ters of Israel and Iuda in these Promises; nour|rished and brought-vp in all Honestie and Purenes|of-life. and were likewise daylie, very earnestlie war|ned, to beware Exod. 20. Deut. 7. a.  in omnibus Prophetis. of all Fornication / as also infour|med with Wisdom, that they should in any-case; keep-well Leuit. 19. their pure maydenlie Bodies, from all Pollution of the Whordom / till that they were meet to be maryed / and that their promised Bryde|groome ioyned himself vnto them.
5. But when-as they now were thus brought|vp  in all Honestie and good Discipline / and became mariageable. and were wooed and called-vpon by their promised Brydegroome (for whom they were so brought-vp) for to be maried / then were they much to prowde or statelie and to Esa. 3. b. Ezech. 16. stif-necked in the reputation of their Honestie / for to submit them to their promised Brydegroome / and to geeue them|selues vnto Him in Mariage: and Pro. 1. c. Iohn. 1. b. refused euenso for to com to their promised Brydegroome. They wolde not moreouer when-as Hee shewed himself vnto them in all Humilitie; knowe nor receaue Him for their promised Brydegroome: For Hee came vnto them Zach. 9. b. Math. 21. al-to-lowlie and to-meekminded: and they haue euenso for his Humilitie and Meekmin|dednes

cause; Esa. 1. a. Math. 21. Iohn. 19. c. dispised Him / and determined with themselues to tarie for som Other: and haue euen|so remayned for a long time, without any Bryde|groome.
6. NOw when that thissame Sonne of the great and mightie King, was thus re|fused of his beloued Frindes (Nea which yet was more; Iohn. 15. b. they hated Him / and draue him awaye from among them) / So turned Hee him then or cast his fauour; to the Math. 21. d. Act. 13. f. Heathen / which liued in all Dishonest-sort and in Whordom / and whose Bo|dies also euen from the Head to the Feete; were altogether polluted / and full of vncleane Spottes.
7. Euenso verelie, was this most-noble and re|nowmed  Sonne of the most-puissant King, infor|sed to forsake those his deerlie-beloued elected, Frin|des the bewtifull and modest Daughters of Israel and Iuda: and Hee wooed the polluted Daugh|ters of the Heathen / to see if peraduenture they wolde receaue Him into their Loue: To the which louelie Proffer of His, the polluted Daughters of the Heathen Act. 13. f. gladlie consented: and they began euenso, to turne their Loue with submitted Hu|nalitie  great Thankes-geeuing; towardes Him.
8. And euenso, in this Good-willingnes of theirs / this most-noble Sonne of y^e puissant King turned his Loue to the Esa. 55. a. Oze. 1. c. Zach. 2. b. Act. 13. f. Rom. 9. c. d. Daughters of the Hea|then / and chose to take them vnto him in Matri|monie. And thatsame caused Hee to be published through his Messengers; vnto them, to a ioyfull Message: and also to be signified vnto them / that

Hee wolde purifie them and make them bewtifull Virgins  also throughlie purge or wash-awaye with his pure  and healthsom Water; all the Filthines and Spottes of their Bodie Ezech. 36. c Iohn. 7. d. Apo. 21. 22. b and so take them 2. Cor. 11. a. Eph. 5. c. to a pure immaculate Bryde; vnto him in Mariage: Conditionallie, that they should for their part; goodwillinglie turne them away, from all their Whordom  also haue a stedfast Beleef Rom. 11. b. c or Confidence to the Purging of their Whordom; on Him and to Him  and therto shew-fourth an vpright Testimonie of Repentaunce, that they left|of their Whordom. and euenso (like-as an vpright Espowsed-wife 2. Cor. 11. a. ought to deale toward her right Husband) altogether cleaue or holde-them vnto Him alone / So wold Hee then likewise in all faith|full Loue; keepe him vnto Them.
9. At which Message, the Daughters of the  Heathen Act. 13. c. were exceeding ioyfull / and gaue great Laude and Thankes with all Humilitie; to the great King the Father of thesame Sonne Rom. 15. b. for the great Grace and mercifull Loue which happened and was extended towardes them: And they re|ceaued euenso thesame with intire Good-willing|nes and plaine Intent; to heart / Act. 13. . Rom. 11. b. c. Col. 1. a. b. with purpose to doo euenso: and applyed them with all Diligence; to accomplish all that which was told them by their Brydegroome / and Act. 13. c. 17. 1. c. heald-fourth by his Mini|sters, before them: in such-sort / that this Sonne of the great and mightie King, had in all their Dili|gence and Feruentnes to accomplish his Will; a good-pleasure in them / and grewe-affected with

great Lust and Loue towardes them.
10. Hee heald himself also with his Loue, whol|lie to them / for that they mought be Oze. 1. e. Rom. 9. c. d. throughlie|purged. Hee decked them with all kinde of costlie At|tire of golden Iewels / and with al-maner of fyne Golde-worke and pretious Stones / as also with the most-fyne Pearles: so that they in Bewtie and Gorgeous-decking / and in all costlie Riches and triumphant Glorie; Rom. 11. b. c excelled and passed far-away, the Daughters of Israel and Iuda.
11. Now when these goodlie-decked and bewti|full  Daughters of the Heathen, were thus in all Loue and Faithfulnes; maried to this most-noble Sonne of y^e most-puissant King. and that they be|came euenso like as an vpright Espowsed-wife with her Husband; of vniforme-beeing with Him / So brought they fourth then vnto Him, manye faire Virgins and chast Daughters / and they brought them vp for Him in all Good-discipline and Hones|tie: and it was in like-maner promised vnto them all in their honest or verteous Bringing-vp; that they should also haue thesame noble  ritch Sonne of y^e most-mightie King, to their Lord 2. Cor. 11. . or Husband.
12. HOwbeit, many of y^e after-borne Daugh|ters of the Heathen, did not vprightlie take-heede vnto the right Coniunction with that noble Sonne / for to keepe themselues constantlie with faithfull Loue; vnto Thesame, . Cor. 11. . their pro|mised Brydegroome.
13. They fayled not at-all, to chalenge vnto them the Name and the Honour, that they stoode

ioyned-in-matrimonie with the noble Sonne / and walked in his Doctrine or Discipline: but y^e Deede to thapproouing of their singleminded Obedience and Faithfulnes; grew in processe-of-time; verye|much Gal. 3. a. Col. 2. b. c. Tit. 1. c. diminished.
14. And when-as they now heard of the Fer|uent-loue and Heartie-lust, which the most-noble Sonne of the most-mightie King, bare towardes their Mothers. and that Hee for their Loues sake; had forsaken his deerest Louers the Daugh|ters of Israel and Iuda / Rom. 11. b. c. So waxed they then so|much the statelier and arroganter / bragging verye|much of the Grace or Fauour which was shewed vnto them: so that they became therthrough verye hawtie-minded / to a more Extolling of themselues in their Disobedience and Presumption: and dispi|sed euenso the sorrowfull and cast-downe or desolate Daughters of Israel Iuda: and vpbrayded them with Reprochful-woordes; of the Indignation and Desolation, into the which they were fallen.
15. Moreouer / in this their Presumption and  Pride, these Daughters of the Heathen beganne to forget and to neglect, to Oze. 4. a. b. 5. a. keepe themselues pure or chast from all Fornication / and to remaine 2. Cor. 11. b. faith|full to their Lorde, to whom they had promised all Fidelitie: and turned them eue~so to straunge Men: and receaued into their Howses, the Gal. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. a. Enemies of their promised Brydegroome: and committing ad|ulterie with thosesame, they brake y^e band of Wed|lock, which they had vowed vnto him: and reioyce|ing them in their Whordom, they bragged still ne|uerthelesse

of their Lorde the Sonne of the great King that Hee was their Husbande / and that They, were his elected Wife. And euenso vnder that Couering of Bosting, of the Name of that noble and renowmed Husband, that Hee was their right Husband. and They, his right Espowsed|wife; they committed incessantlie fornication more|and-more; 2. Cor. 6. b. with al-maner of straunge Men: and did not once thinke, 1. Cor. 6. b. c 2. Cor. 6. b. to turne them cleene-awaye therfrom / or to shew-fourth vpright Fruites of Re|pentaunce for thesame: but became euenso in their Whordom; the lenger the more, polluted  defiled.
16. NOw when that these desolate Daugh|ters of Israel and Iuda, perceaued the vncomblie and shamefull Fornication of y^e Daugh|ters of the Heathen / and how that they greatlie polluted themselues with all Straungers / So could they not then in any-wise be perswaded, that the Maryed-husbande of the Daughters of the Heathen of whom they so bosted; was the right Sonne of the great and mightie King / which was promised in Matrymonie vnto them: but haue therfore somuch-the-more in their Ignoraunce; dispised Esa. 53. a. that noble Sonne of the great-mightie King / and iudged Him to be false. and that Hee was a Luk. 7. 15. a. Louer of Whordom and of all Vncleane|nes. and could not by any meanes beleeue, that Hee was the right Lord or Husband of the Daughters of Israel and Iuda. And the Daughters of Israel and Iuda Rom. 11. remained euenso in this Vnbeleef; as Orphantes, Lam. 5. a. without Father / as desolate Wi|dowes,

Lam. 1. 3. a. without any Husband / and as contracted Mariageable-daughters, without a Brydegrome.
17. And in all this Leauing-destitute and Hea|uynes, they hanged or cast downe their Heads / also sighed Vide Esa: Ier:  alios Prophetas. and prayed. But so-long as they sawe not rightlie into their Offences / nor-yet acknowledged wherfore they were forsaken / so were they not pity|ed nor yet harkened-vnto, of their Lorde and King. but euery-wheare dispised / brought-in-distresse / and afflicted-with-greef, among all People.
18. BVt when as now these vnfaythfull Daughters of the Heathen, had thus a long-whyle; liued and walked in all maner of Whordom and Vncleannes. as also estraunged themselues so vtterlie from the honest Matrimonie and faithfull Loue of their Husband. and yet heald them still neuerthelesse by their high Bosting, that They were the right Espowsed-wife / So became they at the last in their Whordom and Vncleane|nes; diuided into many Partes / and fell euenso to sharpeMath. 24. b. contention one against an-other, about the right Husband (namelie / who should haue Him to be their Lorde or Husbande / and which Sort or Sect was his right Espowsed-wife): and euenso (lie as all Whoores and Adulterous-women vse to doo) they vbrayded each-other with their Ad|ulterie / and discouered among themselues one-an|others Shame and Vchastitie: Though yet-not|withstanding each Sort manifested plaine-enough their Owne, with the Expresse-inuring of their adulterous Deedes /  vncircumcised false Heartes.
19. And although now that nether of these diui|ded Sectes or Partes of the adulterous Daugh|ters, was purged from their Whordom and Vn|chastitie / nether-yet had shewed-fourth any vpright Fruites of Repentaunce / Yet bosted and bragged notwithstanding each Sect in-seuerall, that they in their Whordom; were the right Espowsed-wife of the Husband: and that All y^e other, were Straun|gers therfrom.
20. THissame continued and had in such|sort;  his Fourth-going with y^e Daugh|ters of y^e Heathen / till that the Rom. 11. . Time was fulfilled, that out of the Loue of God the Father / and out of the Seruice of thesame Loue; the Cleernes of the vpright Matrimonie of the promised Sonne of the great-mightie King / and the vpright Fourme of his right Espowsed-wife, was witnessed, declared, and euidentlie signified through HN, Gods elect|ed Minister; on the Earth. and that the Lorde vnder the Obedience of his Loue; 2. Mach. . became merci|full againe vnto his People: and euenso with his Loue and Ier. 31. a. b. with the Loue of his deere Sonne; Oze. 2. 3. cal|led and inuited the Generations of Vide in om|nibus Pro|phetis. Israel and Iu|da, together with Esa. 17. 18. 19 53. 56. Iere. 3. b. Zach. 8. c. all People and Heathen which confessed their Faultes and Whordom / and had a Lust to the right Matrimonie; vnto the right Mariage: and euenso they all which beleeued his Woord of Grace; became renewed in their Vnder|standing / and were brought to-right againe, in the Obedience of y^e Requiring of his Seruice of Loue / as also established in the Faithfulnes of his Loue.

WHo is-ther, that shall iudge the  Wisdom / or-yet be able to interprete her mysticall Prouerbes / seeing that Shee / nether-yet her Prouerbes are knowen nor iudged of any-man / but Pro. 2. b. of the Children which are borne out of y^e Wisdom? For those knowe Her / and can interprete her parabolous Sentences.
2. Therfore doth the Wisdom speake-fourth her Prouerbes, to her Pro. 1. 2. 3. 4. c. Math. 13. b. c Luk. 8. . Children. and the Loue vtter|eth her Vnderstanding, to her Louers / to thende that they should heare and Math. 10. c. Luk. 12. a. vnderstand thesame in secreat / and then tell it fourth againe openlie.
3. THe God of Heauen as the Father him|self; is com-downe: and Hee bringeth in the Seruice of his Loue; Iohn. 14. c. 2. Cor. 6. b. Apo. 21. a. Himself, with his Christ and Holie-gost / and with all that which with Him is Gods, vnto his obedient Man HN. And god|ing thesame with Hym, Hee hath manned hym with thesame: and his Will is, that now in the last tyme through his Seruice of Loue; all Ier. 31. a. Iohn. 12. d. People or Generations of Men, which are goodwilling to his Righteousnes, should assemble them vnto Him and his godded Man: and euenso likewise with them, all that which is manlie / To thend that they all should becom of-one-beeing with Him and his godded Man  and so be all named Gods / Psal. 82. a. Iohn. 10. d. and Children of the Mosthighest. For euenso, in the|same Oze. 2. c. Conioyned-coming and Conformitie-of-bee|ing [namelie / God, with all what is Gods / and

the Man, with all what is manlie] it all what is not Gods nor Manlie, becometh through God and the Man, vtterlie condemned.
4. Beholde / That is now in thissame Daye, Gods Math. 25. d. Act. 17. d. Iudae. 1. b. Iudgment / and the Iudgment of the conioyned Man vnto his God, according to the Righteousnes. And the Publishing of thissame Iudgment vpon the Earth, is a ioyfull Message and good Tydinges, vnto all goodwilling Men / for to applye them to thesame Coniunction: and it is also to a Psal. 96. 98. b Life and Ioye in the Godlynes, vnto all such as beleeue that the God of Sion, is in such|sort; becom King vpon the Earth.
5. THe Man is in his Estraunging from  God; sayled or fared-fourth so farre in the Shipfaring of his great Knowledge; in the mayne wilde Sea / that hee is altogether gon-a|stray or wandereth / and fayleth to be directed any|lenger by the true Course of his Compasse: but say|leth at aduenture now heere and then theare, in the vncertaine places. And when-as hee supposeth to haue found a good Land, to his Preseruing / so per|ceaueth hee then that hee is vtterlie deceaued ther|in / and that hee hath not yeat attayned to the right good Lande.
6. Now when the Man hath gotten a great Lust, for to inherit the Promises of the Blessing / and to com into the good Lande, wheare Exo. 3. 13. . Leui. 20. Deut. 6. a. Honye and Milke floweth / so aryseth-ther vpp then in the Man, a Diligentie-of-working / for to be made an Heyre in thesame Blessing.
7. Out of the Diligentie-of-working, ther com|eth-fourth the tryed Knowledg of the Mans Vn|abilitie and Vnwisdom / for to attaine ther-vnto, as out of his owne Selfnes.
8. Out of the tryed Knowledg of the Mans Vnabilitie  Vnwisdom, ther cometh-fourth Two Parties, one against another.
9. The One Partie, is the Vnbeleef Num. 14. a. and Dis|paire, for to be able by any-meanes; to com-by thatsame at Gods handes, which the diligent Man so seriouslie seeketh-after.
10. The Other Partie, is the Beleef  Num. 14. a Hope, to obtayne thesame by Gods Grace, through the Almightines of God and his Christ: For the Be|leef knoweth that all what is vnpossible with the Man; Math. 19. d. Mark. 10. c. Luk. 18. c. is possible with God.
11. Out of the One Partie namelie / Vnbeleef and Dispaire; ther ariseth the Disobedience Num. 14. a. Heb. 3. b. vnto the holie Woorde and his Requiring. And out of the Disobedience vnto the holie Woorde and his Requiring, ther aryse the manifolde goodthinking Wisdoms of Men / 1. Tim. 4. . 2. Tim. 3. a. 2. Pet. 3. b. and the many-maner of false Expoundinges or Interpretations of the holye Scripture / together with y^e lying  deadlie Gloses.
12. But out of the Beleef and Hope, ther aryseth the Obedience Num. 14. b. Heb. 4. a. vnto the holie Woorde and the Requiring of his Seruice of Loue. And out of the Obedience to the holie Woorde and to the Requi|ring of his Seruice of Loue, ther aryse the Conso|lations of Men, Psal. 94. b. Heb. 10. d. in the Pacient-abyding for the Lorde, in their Long-suffering. And euenso ther

cometh to the Beleef Abac. . . and Hope, the Healp of the Mightie-power of God / and the Knowledg of the godlie Trueth: and leadeth the faithfull obedient Man Iohn. 14. 16. in all Trueth  Loue, in-to the good Lande of Promise / Apo. 21. 22. and in-to y^e eternall Life, his Blessing.
13. At that time ther is found by the Beleeuers  and Obedientons, the Trueth and Loue / Iohn. 14. Apo. 21. and all Concorde and Peace. But with the Vnbeleeuers and Disobedientons, not els-what but good-think|ing Wisdoms / together with all Contention / Schisme and Partialitie / Num. 14. 16. and all Falshod / De|ceit and Faynednes: wherwith they intangle or snare one-another of them / and so remaine with|out the good Lande of Promise.
14. And euenso through these Two-maner of Fourth-goinges; becom these Num. 16. c. 2. Cor. 6. b. Two Parties sepe|rated the one from the other / like as the Sheepe fro~ the Goates. And the One Partie, appeereth Math. 25. d. at the Right-hand of God / and the Other, at the Leaft. And so the Iudgment passeth-fourth according to the Trueth, expressing who are Gods Elect.

PResentlie in this Daye, I am moo|ued  in sondrie Thinges, to meruaile ex|ceedinglie. And must now therfore de|maund the Resolution of those thinges, wherat I so mue and meruaile. And geeue mee Resolution therof, yee Wyse / or yee Scripture|learned / if yee haue Vnderstanding.
2. HOw standeth the case so I pray you; / or out of what Stocke proceedeth it, that ther are Certen / which will themselues, take-vpon|them to procreate themselues Act. 20. d. 2. Cor. 11. d. to Men of God. also teach and nourrish-vp themselues in the Wisdom and Vnderstanding of the godlie Thinges. and be|com euenso out of themselues; Men and Elders of y^e holie Vnderstanding: and will likewise geeue|fourth themselues for Men of God / and againe, beget Men of God / ereuer that they themselues are begotten or brought-fourth of Men of God?
3. From whence cometh it also, that the Fooles account themselues Wyse / and perswade them|selues to haue Vnderstanding: and are also of their Consortes or Adherentes; esteemed for Such?
4. That the Dead, bost them of the Life. and the condemned Vngodlie, praise themselues for blessed?
5. That the Dombe and Deafe, will expounde  or interprete the Prouerbes that are spoken of the Wyse?
6. That the Crypples, will teach Pro. 26. a. the Lame to go right: and they which are Bond-men or Cap|tiues themselues, will loose or set-free others that are Prisoners?
7. That the Blynde, Luk. 6. d. will shewe the right Waye to Such as erre. and the peruerse Eyes and darke Bodies, will teach the Simplicitie of Christ, vnto another?
8. That Those which dwell in Darknes / and haue neuer behelde the Light, will yet Rom. . a. iudge the Light and his Shape or Fourme. and ther-to;

take vpon them, to bringfourth the Light out of the Darknes?
9. That the Sinners, will promise Forgeeue|nes of Sinnes to Such as transgresse: and that likewise the Vncleane, will Eccli. 34. . purge or purifie the Vncleane?
10. That Such as are themselues vnfit or vn|meete, to enter into the Kingdom of God / will yet take vpon them to prepare meete Vessels, to the Kingdom of God?
11. That Those which will speake much of the  Trueth / will Iohn. 8. . not yet themselues once heare the Trueth / nether can they away-with thesame?
12. That Those which were neuer-yet Disci|ples, vnder the holie Vnderstanding / geeue-fourth themselues as Maisters of the holie Vnderstand|ing. and take vpon them, to set-fourth and teach the holie Vnderstanding / and to iudg thesame accord|ing to their owne Minde?
13. That the Needie and such as haue no Bread themselues Esa. 3. . in their Spences or Bynnes, go and call euery-wheare: Com fetch Bread / Com fetch Bread / wee haue aboundaunce therof?
14. How cometh it, that the hungrye Bellyes after the Bread, . 2. a. suffise them with the Winde and Fame of Bread: and euenso as-though they had eaten indeede and were satisfied; holde themselues contented?
15. From whence haue y^e Presumptuous which are themselues with-out the Church of Christ, and haue neuer seene nor knowen any one Stone of the|same;

taken such an Arrogantie on them, that they will gather-together the Stones vnto them  also cowch and dawbe them together . . b. with deceitfull Morter  and so buyld-vpp a Church of Christ: and do not once perceaue, that their Worke auayl|eth not / nor cometh to perfection?

WHeare the Hunter hunteth / and  the Wilde-beast discouereth hymself or cometh in sight / theare do then the Houndes yearne.
2. Wheare the true Light sheweth itself / and wheare-as thesame is witnessed / wheare also the Forefrunt and the Holie of the true Tabernacle be|cometh 1. Esdr. 3. 6. 2. Esdr. 3. 3. Esdr. 1. 5. 8. 2.

3. IN the true Tabernacle of the Lorde, the sweet and pleasant-sauourie Meate, be|cometh now dressed or made-redie, to an holie Meate-offering: and after thesame, do the wylde Beastes vent or smell.
4. The Leuites are entred . Esdr. 1. a.  b. c. into the Forefrunt /  and prepare theare the Trespasse-offering and Sinne-offering, before the Lorde / for to offer-vpy thesame in due time.
5. The Priestes are entred into the Holie / and they Ier. 33. b. Heb. 9. b. kindle or set-on-fire theare, the daylie Offer|ing of the true Godscruice: and euenso the Tres|passe-offering and Sinne-offering, becometh tho|rough the preparation of the Meate-offering; of|fred-vpp and burnt before the Lorde; in the Holie / to the Remission and Cleansing of the Sinnes: and it geeueth-fourth euenso a sweet Sauour, be|fore the Lorde.
6. The High-priest is entred into the Most|holie: Luk. 1. a. Heb. 9. c. and Hee kindleth or setteth-on-fire theare, with his Offering of the Life, the Death-offering / and consumeth the Death in the Life: and the Life keepeth the Victorie for euermore: and euenso 1. Cor. 15. . the Death which is the last Enemie; becometh swal|lowed-vp through Oze. 13. b. 1. Cor. 15. f. Apo. 21. a. the eternall Life / and the King|dom of the God of Heauens is inherited in the eter|nall Life: and euenso in thesame Inheriting, be|cometh now in this Daye, the great and glorious Feast Esa. 25. b. Luk. 14. 22.  Apo. 19. a. of the Lorde celebrated or kept in the King|dom of Heauen.
7. And the Holyons of God and Christ, eate and drinke the wel-dressed Meate / and the wel|prepared Drinke of the Vyne before the Lorde and his Christ; Luk. 14. b. 22. c. in the Kingdom of Heauen. And the sweet or pleasant Sauour of thesame is of so great force, that it is also smelled euen without-fourth.
8. Ther-after now do manye vncircumcised  Heartes / and also manye Ritch-scripture-wyse which are not taught to the Kingdom of Heauen; runne-on venting: Howheit they attaine not to the

Tast of thesame. For it is not meete, that the Vn|circumcised Math. 7. a. should eate therof / nether-yet likewise, that any Vncircumcisedons Esa. 35. 52. a. Ezech. 44. a Ioel. 3. b. Apo. 21. c. should enter into the Sanctuarie of God: For their Tit. 1. Heartes and Thoughtes are altogether vncleane.
9. Manye polluted and vncircumcised Heartes crye-out: God / Christ, and holie Gost. They do also not spare to open their Mouth very-wide, for to talke much therof. also to inuay-against and ma|ligne very reprochfullie all Idolatrie which they with their outward Eyes looke-on or iudg to be I|dolatrie;. and to cursse or defye the Antichrist which yet they knowe not; very vehementlie: and yet ther-vnder; they themselues do serue the De|uell, Iohn. 8. c. the Father of all Idols. They honour the Antichrist, 2. Tess. 2. a. 1. Iohn. 2. c. 4. a. the Deuels Childe: and are replea|nished with the wicked Spirit of Belial. And are euenso before God and his Christ, not els-what but abhominable Idolatours  1. Iohn. 2. c. Antichristians.
10. WIth the pure Heartes and Children of  the Loue, the liuing God is knowen, in his Godhead: the Christ of thesame God Rom. 13. b. Gal. 3. c. is plucked-on, in his christian Beeing: the holie Gost is inherited, in his Iohn. 14. 16. Loue: and the true Light is seene or beholden, Iohn. 1. c. 1. Iohn. 1. a. in his Cleernes.
11. The true Light shyneth vpon the Earth / and shyneth among the Children of the Earth, as tho|rowe a Glasse: but by the Children of the Loue, 1. Iohn. 3. a. in perfect Cleernes.
12. The Minde of the Children of the World, is couered with many-maner of Darknesses / and

their Esa. 28. 29. b Scripture-learned attaine vnto no Trueth. For-that-cause they all walke in the dark Sap. 5. a. Wayes / which leade vnto Destruction.

14. All the Vnderstanding of the Worldlie-wise  and Scripture-learned, is nothing-els before the godlie Wisdom; but as a Iam. 4. . Smoke and Vapour.
15. Therfore is also the Daye of the Lorde, be|fore the Scripture-learned which are not Math. 13. f. taught to the Kingdom of Heauen; and before all Wyse of the Worlde, altogether Esa. 13. . Ioel. 2. a. Amos. 5. . Soph. 1. b. darke / yea not otherwise, but as a Cloude and Mist.
16. Ther are very Fewe which Esa. 44. b. call vpon the Name of the Lorde: Therfore ther are also Fewe defended by the Lorde, Ioel. 2. d. to Preseruation in the Godlynes.
17. Ther are also Fewe that seeke the Vpright and Verytrue / or that indeuour them therafter with all their heart: but they all for the most-part; set their Consolation and Confidence on vaine Thinges. For-that-cause also the begilefull 3. Reg. 22. c. Rom. 11. b. Spi|rit of Lyes, hath the Victorie ouer Many: and theron they highlie-bragge, as-though they had the Trueth.

IT goeth Now with the Children of  Men altogether preposterous: For the Fleash will worke spirituall Thinges / the elementish Creatures will seperate them from the elementish Thinges / and vsuallie busye themselues onlie with the heauenlie Thinges / and those which beare yeat the fleashlie Fore-skinne of the Sinne before their 2. Cor. 3. b. Heartes, will liue and go|fourth, according to the Spirit.
2. The Children for whom it is yet 1. Cor. . a. needfull to be fedd with Milke; will eate strong Meate.

and therto be 1. Cor. 4. b. named Men.
3. They will also as-though they were Men or Elders; 1. Cor. 4. b. procreate Children in wedlocke / and so be called Fathers.
4. The Disciples forsake the Doctrine and In|struction Heb. 13. b. of the Elders / and set-vp themselues a|gainst their Elders; to be Elders: and Leui. 10. . place them|selues euenso in the Office or Roome of the El|ders / for to minister the Priestes-office themselues / and to appropriate and transport Num. 16. b. according to their Minde; the Gouernment of Rulers, vnto themselues.
5. The Bond-men which are subiect to seruice; will be free Maisters / and pluck to them the In|heritaunce of their Maisters: and so take vpon them to beare Lordship ouer their Maisters. and the elementish Children / and y^e worldlie Captiues, will 2. Pe. 2. . applie the Freedom of the Children of God, on themselues.
6. The Hyrelinges which are Apo. 3. b. altogether poore / and must of necessitie liue by their Daye|wages / and haue no ouerplus by them; / will di|stribute-fourth much Riches / and beare the Name that they are ritch.
7. The Women will now marie with Women /  and geeue Seede vnto each-other, to the Bringing|fourth of Children: and those that were neuer yet conceaued with childe / grone  crye-out, as-though they were in the extremitie of trauell, in Childbirth.
8. They that are bidden to the Mariage-feast, keepe themselues backe Math. 22. . Luk. 14. b. with Excuses / and they

themselues prepare their owne Mariage-feast / and keepe thesame together with each-other, without Brydegroome and Bryde.
9. The Maried-women which ought to holde themselues in all Faithfulnes onlie by their Es|powsed-husbandes; geeue themselues to commit Whordom / and breake the Wedlocke. They play the harlottes with straunge Ier. 2. d. 3. a. Men / and take-plea|sure Ezech. 16. in their Whordom.
10. They are becom likewise so presumptuous by themselues in their Whordom / that they stick not to proclayme-them an whorish Mariage-feast. also bid Ezec. 16. 22. many Adulterers  Adulterices therto. and keepe euenso thesame with Whoores and Naugh|typackes: and becom one with-another; vtterlie drunken with the Apo. 17. a. 18. a. Wyne of their Whordom and Vncleannes.
11. THat which is Most-bewtifull, is now  counted to be the Vncleanest of all other: and to pluck-on the gorgeous Math. 22. b. Apo. 3. b. Wedding-feastes Garment, is now of Many; counted a thing worthy of derision.
12. The right Bread, is counted to be vinewed or mustie / and the Children of Men make one-an|other to lothe it: in such-sort / that they abhorre to eate therof: and so they seeke to saciate or fill them with straunge Bread / and with their owne Dirt.
13. The vpright Wine of y^e right Vine which is pressed to vpright Ioyfulnes; is counted of Manye, as fustie and sower or without good ver|dure: and they will presse-them New-wine out of

the Bramble-eries / and so refreash and reioyce them with straunge Wine / and with their owne and bitter Filthines.
14. The forworne Fountaines are becom Ier. 14. a. drie: their Waters are runne to-an-ende in their course / and stand altogether still for yeelding of anye-more Water: And the Children of Men digge Ier. 2. b. with great Diligence; for new or freash Waters: and seeke to get or com-by thesame, out of their Ier. 2. b. . foule Pooles / and stinking Puddles or Pittes.

THe Husbandmen or Tillers of the  Land, knowe not how to diuide the Sow|ing-time from the Eccle. 3. . Mowing-time. They knowe not likewise the Fruites, from the Leaues / nor the Corne, from the Chaffe.

3. The Masons knowe not the good Stones, from the bad: nether-yet do they also vnderstand the difference betwixt the Worke of the Foundati|on / and the Worke that is set theron: and they morter or lay-on all their Masendrie-worke Ezec. 13. b.  with deceitfull Morter.

And the thing wherwith they go-about to cure or heale the Lyues of Men / therwith they bring-in the Death and Corruption to the Life / and so marre the Life of Man.
6. The Marchauntes are vnexpert in their  Trade-of-marchandice: For they knowe not the right-true Goods, from the Counterfait / nether|yet the fyne Pearles and pretious Stones, from the False: and trafficke euenso with false Mar|chandice.
7. The Sheepheardes or Those that will be called Pastours of Sheepe; knowe not the Sheep, from the Goates. And the Howse-holders which appoint the Heardmen ouer the Sheepe; knowe not the Ezec. 34. a. b Iohn. 10. Heardmen or Pastours of the Sheepe, from the Wolues / nor the Feeders, from the Deuour|ers / wherthrough also in generall, the Sheepe are not protected nor yet dulie pastured.
8. The Wolues put-on Sheepe-skinnes / Math. 7. c. Rom. 16. b. 2. Cor. 11. b. and knowe how to bleate like Sheepe and Lambes. And euenso in their Bleating; they brute-fourth the seelie Sheepe, to be Wolues / for that they mought ac|cording to their woluish Nature; Iohn. 10. bite and deuour the seelie Sheepe. But it hath neuer ben seen / nether shall it likewise euermore be seene, that the Sheepe do byte or deuour the Wolues: but they greatlie|feare

the Wolues / and flee for that they mought be defended; to their Pastour or Heardman.
9. Howbeit, manye Sheepe are now becom al|together  insensible or without perceauing / and knowe not their right Hearders or Pastours / nor|yet their Voyces, from the Straungers. Iohn. 10. b. And by reason that ther are so many false Pastours risen|vp / Ezech. 1. b 34. a. b. Math. 24. a.  which can counterfait in the sounding-fourth of their Voyces, the Voyce of the vpright Pas|tours / the insensible seelie Sheepe, knowe not how to discerne the false Pastours / nor their seducing Voyces, from the vpright Pastours: and so they runne for the most-part; after the Sounde of the Voyce of the . Reg. 22. false Pastours: and becom euenso verye rufullie seduced / and brought to the Sham|bles / and part of them also, into much Calamitie and Distresse.

HOw can it by any reason; go-well  vpon the Earth? For the Sheepe are com|mitted and put-in-trust vnto the Wolfe, for to be kept / the little Fishes, to the Cat / and the sweet Hearb-garden, to the Swine.
2. All Errours and vnright Wayes, are called right Esa. 5. . Wayes: and the Vnfaithfull, which steale the Goods out of their Maisters or Gouernours Chestes / and trafficke or occupie false Marchan|dice therwith, are called Iust-persons.
3. Those which haue neuer-yet ben Disciples in

the Schoole of Christ. but are risenvp out of Apo. 2. c. the Deuels Synagogge / are now called Christians / or they geeue-fourth themselues for Such. And the wicked and darke Consciences, place themselues for Iudges, Esa. 5. c. betwixt Good and Euell / and betwixt Light and Darknes.
4. Those which haue no Intelligence of the Trueth nor of the Light of Life, will now teach the Trueth vnto Others / and direct them to the Light of Life: and the Ignorant, will plant Vnderstan|ding into the Simple.
5. The Dead, bost them of the Life: and those which lye yeat as the Dead, in the Graues / will publish the Life and the Resurrection of the Dead / and promise the eternall Ezech. 18. b Life, to the Vnbeleeuers that are dead.
6. The Infidels account themselues for Belee|uers: and yet neuerthelesse they dye Iohn. 8. c. in their Sin|nes: and the Inheritaunce of their Reward, is the eternall Rom. 6. a. Apo. 19. 20. c Death. But the vpright Beleeuers, dye in the Death of Christ: Rom. 6. a. and the Inheritaunce of their Rewarding, is y^e Resurrection with Christ, and the eternall Life.
7. They which are minded against the Lawe / and are in all; giltie as touching the Lawe / do yet inforce or Math. 23. a. driue men to keepe the Lawe.
8. They which are themselues vnbeleeuing / d yet set-fourth very strcictlie; the Beleef to be kept, on paine of Damnation.
9. They which knowe not the Euangelie of the Kingdom / nor yet haue euer receaued thesame  nor

10. The Blynde affirme Iohn. 9. d. that they see / the Spiritlesse-persons, do highlie vaunt them of the holie Spirit / and the Vngodlie make their bost, that the onlie God is their God / and that they haue the Woorde of the Lorde.
11. WHere now therfore it goeth thus to|worke, as is resited / Esa. 1. c. Ezec. 22. a. b euen-theare are the Iust / together with all Singleminded and Littleons of vnderstanding, inforced in their iust Causes; to suffer wrong: also the sorrowfull Wi|dowes and the Fatherles are oppressed  and the true Doctrine of the Seruice of Loue, blaspheamed and resisted.
12. The angwished Heartes for the Righteous|nes cause, finde theare no place for to obtaine anye Libertie or Refreashing: nether-yet is the innocent or vngiltie Bloud defended ether protected theare / but is rather Esa. 59. .

14. Moreouer / whosoeuer wolde theare go-a|bout to conuert the Sinners from their Sinnes / and to induce or leade them to an vpright Life, both before God and Men / hee is accounted and iudged for 2. Cor. 6. a. a Sducer: and hee is slaundered with all Wickednes / and bruted for an Euel-dooer. This|same is ssuredlie, a great Miserie vpon the Earth.
15. Whoso can new in thesame wicked Time, perceaue or note all these fore-mentioned wycked Deedes / They may also perceaue therout / that the same Time, is euenlike as was the Time of Noe, in Gen. 6. 7. 9 the former corrupted World / and as the Time of Lot, in Sodom and Gomor, and that in the|same Time, all Iniquitie and Falshod flourisheth in vigour.
16. They may farder note and perceaue / that in the self-same Time, the Worlde is couered-ouer with the Exod. 10. c. Darknesses of Egipt, with the Plagues of Exod. 7. 8. 9. 10. Pharao, with the Ignoraunce of the Cana|nites, with the Contention and Discorde of the in|tangled Gen. 11. a. Babel, with the Deceit and Institution of the false Godseruices of 3. Reg. 12. Ieroboam, with the wicked Enterprise or Deuise of 3. Reg. 21. c. Iezabel, with the  Srytefulnes of the Scripture-learned and Math. 22. 23. 24. 27. 28. of the Pharisees and Saducees, with the Am|bition of Iohn. 19. b.

The XIIII. Chapiter.
THe Kingdom of God, is groun|ded  inwardlie in the Math. 13. . Luk. 17. c. Field of the Man / euen-like as a Lillie-braunch is planted in the Middest of an Husbandmans Fielde / which is by nature inclined to bringforth Thistles.
2. Now the Thistles Math. 13. . growing-vpp, do shewe|fourth the Bewtie of their Flowers: they get also som Praise for their Fayrnes / vntill such time as that the sweete-smelling Lillie-flowers, do make|manifest themselues out of the Lillie-braunch; with their pure Bewtie.
3. Howbeit / the Lillie-flowers do excell  passe in their pure Bewtie and sweete Smell; the This|tel-flowers, far-awaye: in such-sort, that eueryone which beholdeth them / and smelleth their sweete and delightfull Sauour; must needes Cant. 2. . praise and commend the Lillie-flowers, more then all This|tel-flowers.
4. For-that-cause likewise, the Husbandman doth loue the Lillie-flowers, with such a singular Loue / that hee vtterlie rootethout y^e Thistles with their Flowers and Seedes, from-off his Math. 13. . Field / and so geeueth Roome to the Lillie with her Flow|ers: and hee bringeth also into thesame Field; by the Lillie-flowers, all the Plantes of his pleasant|smelling Hearbes / and maketh of thesame his Field, a Garden-of-pleasure.
5. THey which are ether walke with-out the  Kingdom of God and his Righteousnes / and stand not submitted vnder the Ministration of the holy Woorde, which reacheth to the Kingdom

of God / Those harken-to and geeue-eare from without-fourth; very diligentlie, what-maner of sraunge Sounde thatsame Sounde mought be, which witnesseth of the Kingdom of God.
6. But when-as they now make inquisition or search after thesame / and that they are com som|what nye vnto thesame Sound for to heare som Newes therout / and not to stand obedient thervn|to or to the Requiring of thesame; / So are then thesame Testimonies of the Kingdom of God, not els-what vnto them, but as a closed Esa. 29. b. Booke / and a fast-sealed Pit / yea, and as it were a Prouerbe or secreat Math. 13. b. Luk. 8. b. Sentence.
7. They looke-about diligentlie after thesame: and they digge also with all their owne Vnder|standing; very earnestlie after the Knowledg of the Kingdom of God, in their Inwardnes. But they cannot in all their Vnderstanding; consider nor yet once conceaue y^e 1. Cor. 2. b. Fourme or Fashion of thesame.
8. They seeke likewise no-doubt; with painfull  labour and much trauell, for the Kingdom of God. But-yet whenas thesame and his vpright Righte|ousnes, is setfourth before their Eyes / and witness|ed or declared vnto them / then haue they no Lust therto, for to receaue thesame / or to enter therin: and therby they manifestlie expresse or make-know|en, that they knowe not the Kingdom of God / ne|yet vnderstand the Cleernes Luk. 17. c. of his Comming.
9. Howbeit / it is graunted to the beleeuing and obedient Disciples of the holie Woorde and hys Seruice of Loue, to vnderstand Math. 13. b. Luk. 8. b. the Mysterie of

the Kingdom of God / and the Entraunce into his Righteousnes.
10. It is likewise permitted them, to eate of the secreat Apo. 2. b. heauenlie Bread. and therto ther is geeuen them a white Stone / wher-vpon is writen a New Name / which noman knoweth, saue onlie hee which receaueth thesame Stone with the New Name. And That is the Difference betwixt the true Bee|ing, which is remaining with the Elders / and the Images or Figures, which are administred vnto the Disciples, to an Introduction for them vnto the true Beeing.
11. But where-as now ther is no vpright Diffe|rence  obserued, among the Elders or Teachers / and the Disciples which are taught, betwixt the true Beeing / and the Images or Figures / euen-theare then also ther is no Discretion taking-effect or vsed: and where-as ther is no Discretion / thearePro. 19. a. can it not go-well with any Soule. For the Math. 2. c. Iudgement nor the Mercifulnes / nether-yet the Ceremonies of the vpright Seruing-of-god, are not theare obser|ued / nor yet likewise is the Trueth of thosesame ef|fectuallie knowen.
12. But where-as the true Beeing of God and Christ, is remaining with the Elders or Teach|ers: and that thesame Elders, administer vnto the Disciples which are taught; the Images or Fi|gures, out-of thesame true Beeing to an Intro|duction for them vnto thesame true Beeing; / euen|theare is then the Iudgment Oze. 6. c. Math. 23. c. and the Merciful|nes / as also the Ceremonies of the vpright Serue|ing-of-god,

vsed or obserued sinceerlie and accord|ing to the Trueth.

FOr-as-much now as that the Wis|dom  resteth-secreat before the Dispisers of the Seruice of Loue / and before Such as resist thesame / and are disobedient thervn|to. and that thesame is manifest and wel-knowen vnto the Elders in the Familie of Loue / Therfore do I open my Mouth / and speake my Prouerbes, to thesame Elders in the Familie of Loue / for to make-manifest euenso vnto them Psal. 78. . in Parables; the Wisdom and her Mysteries. For in the Obedience of the Loue, it is graunted vnto them to Math. 13. b. Mark. 4. b. Luk. 8. b. vnder|stand the Mysterie of the Kingdom of God / toge|ther with the Prouerbes of the Wyse / and the Sayinges of the Vnderstandingons.
2. Wherfore O yee Elders and Fathers of the Familie of Loue; Pro. 1. 4. a. b so let now all these parabolous Sayinges of myne which I presentlie in this Day of myne Olde-age, speake-fourth vnto you; sinke into your Heartes.
3. Obserue likewise and Keepe with all Disi|gence; in the Congregation of the Loue, the Ordi|naunces of Howsholding / and the Gouernment of your Familie / and of all That which is vnder your Handes, euen as I expresse or hold-fourth thesame before you.
4. Do you in like maner holde-fourth thesame

in all Loue; before the Goodwilling, which walke obedientlie in our mostholie Godseruice of Loue / to thende that yee in all your Ministrations; may euenso alwayes rule wiselie and vnderstandinglie  and so accomplish all your Matiers with good Prouidence or Circumspection; in the holie Vnder|standing.
5. Geeue not ouer your Pro. 6. . Lust at any time; as  subiect vnto Sleape: but watch alwayes and haue a care both night and daye; ouer the Soules Act. 20. c. 2. Tim. 4. . of your Subiectes: and see that yee keepe euenso al|wayes fourth-and-fourth; a good Watch, against all the Destruction which is a comming.
6. Let alwayes the Ministration about the needfull Thinges; sinke into your Heartes: and to a good Preseruing or Safetie; take euermore good-heede, vnto all that which is committed to your Charge and put-in-trust vnto you, ether by God or Men.
7. Let not your Fieldes to any increasing of Weedes; lye waste Ier. 4. . or vnplowed / lest that those|same after the Nature of their owne Yeelding or Bringing-fourth; growefull of al-maner of Wee|des / or wax stubborne and barren by themselues.
8. Therfore plowe your Landes or Fieldes be|times / and prepare them to a mollified Earth: and euenso with the Harrowe, purge or scower them well from the Rootes of the Weedes.
9. Let not in anycase; any-what at-all, of the Weedes or of their Rootes, remaine in your Fiel|des, nether yet likewise anything of all what-soeuer

is like to hinder or indamage y^e good Corne which yee sowe in your Fieldes; in y^e Growing-vp therof.
10. When yee now haue well tilled your fiel|des  / and made them throughlie redie, for to sowe the good Corne therin / Then sowe you in each Field, such Seede or Graine as his Nature requi|reth / or as it is able to bring-fourth: whether it be then Wheate / Barlie / Otes / Rye / Annice / or Cummyn.
11. And when yee then haue in seasonable time; sowen your Fieldes / so be not ouerhastie to the Growing-vpp therof / for to haue the Haruest, be|fore y^e right Time: but waite with Long-suffering, for Iam. 5. . the Eauening-and-morning Raine / for the sweet Dewe of Heauen / and for the Warmth of the Sunne-shining: through which Conioyning or Together-operation; on your sowen Fieldes, your Seede shall receaue his full Increase / and be mul|tiplied plentifullie.
12. But forget not in all thissame, to bestowe all your Care and Diligence, for to Math. 13. d. weede-fourth or pluckvp throughlie all the Weedes which growe in your Fieldes, besides or among the good Seede; from out-of your Fieldes / lest that thesame in grow|ing-vp against the good Corne, should get the Pre|heminence therouer.
13. Now if yee doo euen-thus / and that yee take  all these thinges effectuallie to heart / so shall yee then reioyce you in the Fertilitie of your Fieldes  and in y^e time of Haruest, reape much Fruite therof.
14. When yee now in the Haruest, haue reaped

your Fruites wherin the Lorde hath blessed or prospered you; from-of your Fieldes / so Math. 1. d. gather and laye you vp thesame then in your Barnes.
15. And whenas the Winter cometh / and that all Fieldes lie barren and without Fruit / then feede you your Howsholdes, with your Increase or Store that is growen / and liue therwith, in Ioye: and satisfie yourselues euenso with the Fruites of your Fieldes, eueryone according to the Desire or Appetite of his Soule.

COnsider adunsedlie and vprightlye  heere-on with good Vnderstanding; O yee Elders and Fathers of the Howsholde: Be not in anycase sluggish / nether yet negligent or carelesse, in all thissame so needfull an Office or Ministration: but respect well the Pro. 6. a. right Time / whylst that thesame serueth and is necessarie for you, to all good Exercise / So shall yee then haue alwayes Corne in your Barnes / and Bread e|nough within your Howses. And in the time when the Hunger Amos. 8. b. falleth vpon the People / and that the Countries are clene without Corne / yee shall Esa. 65. b. haue sufficient therof / and that in great aboundance.
2. And when that yee thus in the deere Time [namelie / in the Time of Lacking or Scarcitie of Corne and Bread] haue Corne enough / and plen|tie of Bread, to your Suffising / euen-like as in the Time of aboundance: and that the Lorde your

God, hath made you ritch and fat, with Corne and Bread / Leuit. 26. b. Esa. 58. b. 65. 66. with Gardens-of-pleasure and Vine|yardes / and with all what-euer is needfull for you: and that yee haue aboundance of Water, in your Fountaines and Riuers / So becom not then slug|gish nor sleapie / wherby yee mought chaunce to for|get all good Orders-of-discipline, seruing to the E|difying of your Familie / which I do this-daye to the Preseruation of You and your Families; ex|presse and set-fourth before you.
3. Becom not likewise wanton, inordinate, or  volupteous, wherby yee should growe negligent towardes your Fountaines / Fieldes / and Vine|yardes / lest that your Fountaines do wax drie for lack of Water / or-els becom polluted with foule Waters: and that the Thistles Pro. 4. b. and Nettles o|uergrowe or take-any-roote in your Gardens-of|pleasure and Vineyardes / as also in your earable Fieldes: and that euenso through such your Ne|gligence; your Vines wanting their due and or|derlie Dressing or good Husbanding; faile to yeeld|fourth their Increase of good Wine in any store or aboundance; vnto you.
4. For that cause neglect not the time, for to maintaine and keepe your Fountaines with their Waters, in all Purenes / and to cut in due season; the Braunches of your Vines.
5. Pare or cut I saye; very well and orderlie, the Braunches of your Vine: spare not hardelie to pare them somwhat short / but cut-off from them the Ranknes of their superfluous Increasing or

Shooting-fourth in their growing: and let not the principall growen-fourth Braunches be suffered to beare or nourrish anymore then a fewe or shorte Shootes, in the Stem of their Vine / So shall then your Vines yeelde you fourth great store of Wine and sweet Must, to your Reioycing.
6. But if yee let the Braunches of your Vine  according to the Ranknes of their forwardnes of growing; remaine out-of-measure long / then will they bring you fourth no-doubt; many Leaues. but not much Wine.
7. Take therfore now a good regarde heervnto / and haue euenso your delight in the tilling  dress|ing of your Vineyardes: and reioyce you in the Sweetnes of y^e Wine that proceedeth of thosesame.
8. TRauell and vew also in like-maner to a ood Exercise; thorowe-out, your Gar|dens-of-pleasure / Pomerayes / or Orchardes: and haue a good regard to the Twigges of the Trees / lest that they in the Bringing-fourth of their Fruites; should hinder one-another / or-yet let or keepe-away the Shining of the Sunne.
9. Haue no pleasure in the superfluous Multi|tude of Twigges / which may any-waye be da|magefull or-yet hindersom to the fruitfulnes: but prune them / and shrid-away or cut-off the vnpro|fitable and noysom Twigges / wherby that the Sunne with his bright Shining; may shine-tho|rowe betweene them / and that the profitable or ex|pedient Twigges mought euenso to the Bring|ing-fourth of their perfect and ful-rype Fruites;

haue roome enough for them.
10. IN all this same your good Order-of-ex|ercise, be alwayes without faile; wel|mindfull heerof / namelie / that yee with Careful|diligence; see to the Protection of your Families or Howsholdes / also rule or order them vprightlie, to the maintenaunce of all good Peace / and prouide for them with all good and necessarie Purueiance. And euenso rule or exercise you all thinges, by the direction of the Pro. . . Sap. 6. a. Wisdom of the Lorde / to thende that your Howsholdes may be in al-thinges; so louelie  peaceable / that nothing-els may be found, perceaued, ether prooued by them, but that they to|gether with each-other; are a concordable Howse of Loue and Peace.
11. Therfore ought yee also to haue alwayes a sharpe eye, Rom. 16. b. toward Such as adioyne not them|selues to the Obedience of the Loue / but are rather prosumptuous and contentious ther-against / and therto stirre-vp Other-moe to Contention, against the same: And suffer them not in any case; to haue Place, for to dwell by you / lest that they disturbe your whole Familie / and make them seditious, to all Vnpeaceablenes.
12. And albeit that They to the Satisfying of their Lust and Desire; com crowhing vnto you, as though they were hungrie and thirstie / yet Eccli. 12. a. feede them not for-al-that, in their Hunger / nether quench you their Thirst: Eate not also with them, of one Bread / nether yet likewise drinke you with them, out of one Cup: but let them passe-away / and haue

not any Pitie or Compassion at-all ouer them.

LOoke well and aduisedlie heervnto /  that yee be found faithfull in All whatsoe|uer I do presentlie in this Daye or Light of the Loue; expresse or declare vnto you / So shall then your Howse with your whole Fami|lie euen out of the Seruice of the Loue; be verye|well and orderlie considered-of ether edified / and all your Landes shall be inhabited in Peace, euen for euermore.
2. The Wicked / together with all Seditious and Euel-willingons, shall tremble or be-afraide before you / and flee-away farre from you: and the Lorde will geeue you wide and large Roome.
3. PRepare alwayes requisite or conuenient Worke, Eccli. 33. c. d for your Oxen and Asses / for your Men-seruantes and Maide-seruantes which yee haue retained for to doo your Seruice; within your Howse / wherby they may be occupied and not rest-ydle / Lest that they by the meanes of Ydlenes; should wax slothfull / or-els hauing ouermuch spare|time; be mooued for to deuise som mischeuous or lewde Practise / or to imploy and indeuour them to som naughtie Abuse.
4. Yee shall fardermore; obserue or make Gal. 4. a. no Difference, betwixt your Seruantes  your Chil|dren whylst that your Children are yeat young / and must stand vnder the rule of Discipline and the

Rod; in their Labour / nether-yet shall yee suffer anyone to be ydle or vnoccupied, but onlie on the Sabboth-daye of the Lorde, when-as the same is com / like as the Lorde hath Exod. 20. b. 31. c. Leuit. 23. c. Deut. 5. b. commaunded it.
5. In like-sort also yee ought alwayes to be  mindfull of the Sabboth-daye of the Lorde / and to holde the same very-reuerent or high-worthelie in estimation, before eueryone / to thende that eueryone mought likewise be Heb. 4. b. alwayes mindfull of the same, for to halowe it / and to rest them therin: and that they all euenso which are Exod. 20. b. mindfull of the Sab|both-daye of the Lorde, for to halowe the same; mought recreate and reioyce them with their El|ders and Fathers of the Howsholde; in the same.
6. Moreouer, in this Sabboth-daye of the Lorde / yee shall all one with-another; keepe alike Rest or Holy-daye together: namelie / from the Greatest or Principallest fourth / Dut. 5. b. euen to the very Smallest.
7. BE not likewise negligent or slack, to pre|sent yourselues before the Lorde, in his High-festiual-times of the Holie-assembling: and obserue Exod. 23. b. 34. b. Deut. 16. c. euenso those same, according to their right Ordinaunce / together with the Institutions and Rites / like as the Lord your God hath commaun|ded those same to be obserued  and ordained them in his Seruice of Loue / So shall then the High-festi|ual-dayes of your Holie-assemblies, be named a right Holie-assembling / euenlike as the Lorde Leuit. 23. a. hath ordained the same.
8. Forget not moreouer, the Poore and Needie 

which Leui. 29. Deut. 15. . Tob. 4. b. dwell among you / nether-yet also the Widowes Esa. 1. c. Iere. 22. a. and Fatherles: but let them sinke into your Heartes / and consider of them, euen as your owne Soules: and Tob. 4. b. Esa. 5. . withholde not the Almes nor withdrawe not your Healpe from the Needie: and be in like-maner comfortable and frindlie (and that with all Counsaile and Information of the Testimonies of y^e holie Spirit of the Loue of Iesu Christ) vnto such as are in Distresse and afflicted with Sorrowe / whenas they with singleminded|nes of Heart; shall seeke Counsaile or Comfort at your handes.
9. TO all these good and laudable Exercises O yee Elders and Fathers of Families; let your Mindes and Thoughtes stand alwayes inclined: and holde you alwayes manlie in the Wisdom, touching the Ordering and Gouernment towardes your Families and Subiectes / So shall then all those that haue intended or stoode-minded vnto Wrong and Falshod, stand-in-feare of you. but yee shall be heartelie beloued of those that loue the Righteousnes / and be likewise commended and reuerenced in your good Gouernment; of all vp|right Heartes.

O Yee Elders / which are becom gri|sell  with Age: Haue alwayes a prouident or carefull Eye, towardes your Wiues / which to becom of-mutual-beeing with

you; haue ioyned or coupled themselues with you, as Fellowe-bodies of your Bodies / to their Pre|seruation with you, in all Godlines: and beare al|wayes a good Care ouer them: For / for that they mought be preserued with you in one Beeing of God and his Loue; yee shall nourrish and cherrish them, as your owne Bodies: for they are with you one Fleash, of your Fleash / Gen. 2. c. Math. 19. a. Mark. 10. a. and one Bone, of your Bones.
2. Yee shall also, in all Orderlines euenlike as Yee yourselues do walke in the Lawe or Ordinance of the Lorde; keepe your Wiues submitted vnder your Lawe, Eph. 5. d. Col. 3. c. to all Obeysaunce: and nourrish and maintaine them euenso therin with all diligence; to a fourth-going of the Righteousnes.
3. Permit them not likewise to doo or to leaue|vndon any-maner of thing (be it then what it is) but onlie that which is agreeable to your Lawe: and liue and walke euenso with them, in all good Gouernment and Orderlines / according to the Lawe or Ordinaunce of the Lorde.
4. And in all this same, so loue, foster, and cher|rish  your Wiues nether more nor lesse; euen as your Eph. 5. d. owne Bodies / and cleaue whollie vnto them, in Math. 19. a. Eph. 5. d. 1. Pet. 3. b. one Loue with God and his Righteousnes. For euenso to the same Conformitie-of-beeing; hath God Gen. 1. c. 2. c preordained you to be One of-vniforme|beeing.
5. Forasmuch then as that yee to-gether are but one Gen. 2. c. Eph. 5. c. Bodie / therfore yee shall not faine nor couer you before each-other. but walke alwayes openlie

and vncoueredlie in all naked Purenes; before each-other: and haue euenso a good-pleasure, in each-others Bewtie and Purenes.
6. For God hath Gen. 2. c. created the Man in all na|ked Purenes or Sinceritie / and in like-maner also his Wife: and coupled them to-gether in the same naked Purenes: And vnto the same naked or vnco|uered pure Bewtifulnes, are wee also All through Iesus Christ and his holie Spirit of Loue; called and bidden. For-that-cause it is likewise Gods Will and Good-pleasure, that yee together which are one Man and one Wife 1. Cor. 11. b. Eph. 5. d. in the Lorde; should alwayes walke before God and before each-other; in the same naked Purenes of the godlie Fairnes  and liue euenso as one Bodie with each-other; in all Sinceere-purenes.
7. But let the Man be the 1. Cor. 11. a. Eph. 5. c. Head / or the Lorde of the Wife / euenlike as God is the Head or the Lorde of the Man.
8. The Wife shall not out of herself, 1. Tim. 2. c. Eph. 5. c. beare any rule or-yet haue any Maistership. but with the Man or through the Man, according to his Or|dinaunce.
9. FOr-that-cause yee shall likewise O yee  Men and Elders in the godlie Wisdom; haue a good regarde and a sharpe respect vnto your Wiues, as to marke whervnto they incline their Heartes: To your Lawe / or from your Lawe: To your Freedom / or from your Freedom.
10. Now if yee perceaue that they incline their Heartes to your Lawe / and to your Freedom / 

so shall yee then haue also with each-other 1. Pet. . a. one|maner of Lawe in the Lorde / one-maner of Faith in Iesu Christ, and one-maner of Freedom and Vnitie of the Heart, in the holie Spirit of Loue.
11. Heere-in O yee Elders and Fathers of the Howshlde; becm yee prudent and vnderstand|ing: and liue euenso concordablie with your Wi|ues phe. 5. . as one Bodie with each-other; to the Laude of the God of Life and his Glorious-lordlines: also growe Gen. 1. c. and multiplie into many Thowsandes vpon the Earth / and bring the Earth vnder you, in all Vnitie of the vpright Life.
12. NOtwithstanding, the Conclusion or  Perfection of all that which is heere spo|ken / is This: That yee O yee Men; shoulde not loue Rom. 6. 14. nor liue vnto yourselues. but alone vnto the 2. Cor. 5. b. Lorde your God, in all Loue and Peace.
13. In like-maner also O yee Wiues; yee shall not loue nor liue vnto yourselues. but alone vnto your 1. Pet. 3. a. Husbandes: out of whose Liues and Bo|dies, yee are with them in God and with God; one Gen. 2. c. Math. 19. a. Bodie, to their Healpe.
14. And liuing euen-thus with each-other in all Loue / so lade and praise with Ioye and Than|kes-geeuing; the Lorde your God / for that Hee hath not created you to any Seperation or Diui|sion. but hath ioyned you together as One; in one godlie Being. and that thesame God, is also your Head 1. Cor. 11. a. and King.

OYee Elders and Fathers of the  Howsholde so many as ther are of you in the Congregation of the Loue; / see-to|it in any-case; that yee be continuallie mindfull of all thissame conuenient Orderlines  Louelines, wherin God hath constituted and or|dained you, vnder the Obedience of his Loue: and in all your Peaceablenes and Louelines, shewe yourselues likewise Ephe. 6. a. luelie and frindlie, towardes your young-borne Children. And when-as y^e Mo|thers haue your young Infantes on their Lapp / and when they also sucke the Breastes of their Mo|ther / then playe and dallie with them: and recreate and reioyce yourselues euenso in al-maner of Plea|sant-sweetnes; with your Wiues  young Babes.
2. In such-sort, shall yee in all Sweetnes and Louelines; play, est, and make-sport with the Suck|linges your young Infantes: and bring in their Sight whylst that they in the simple Innocentie, yeat sucke y^e Milke out of their Mothers Breastes; all whatsoeuer delighteth or pleaseth them / and can|not destroy them. and deale or behaue yourselues euenso with them, in all Conformitie of their In|fantie / and restraine them not from any Ioye or Pleasure, in all what is commodious for them.
3. Let all thissame Louelines and delectable Frindlines with your Wiues and young In|fantes; be alwayes delightfull or wel-pleasing vn|to you: and vse euenso all your Amiablenes and Gouernment Pr. .  Sap. 6. . out of the Wisdom / So shall then your Wiues stand euermore submitted to your

Lawe or Ordinaunce / and must likewise needes laude and praise the Vertues of your Louelines / and the peaceable Beeing of your Wisdom. and so reioyce them with you in your louelie Soscietie: in such-sort, that their Faces shall also stande al|wayes very amiable and frindlie, to your Loue / to all Vnitie with your Heartes.
4. BVt-yet in all thissame, looke well heerto, that yee beare alwayes a singular care ouer your young Eccli. 7. 30. Infantes / that they through any-thing that they out of their Childishnes, take pleasure in; destroy not / nether-yet hurt or hinder themselues. Suffer them not in any-case, to sucke the Breastes of any straunge Women. much-lesse then, the Breastes of Whoores.
5. But when-as now your young Infantes, are a little growen-vp / so that they can comprehend som difference, in their Vnderstanding  and bring|fourth som Reason or Wittie-deuise out of them|selues / Then shall yee weane them from the Milke of their Mother / as also fro~ their childish Delight or Pleasure: and begin euenso then from their Youth vp; to set before their Eyes Lam. 3. b. Eccli. 30. b. Eph. 6. a. the Lawe of the Lorde / and to teach them to Tob. 1. 4. a. feare God: and so as the time passeth-on according to their Grow|ing-vp in Yeares; geeue them somwhat harder or stronger Meate then the Milke of their Mother; for to eate / to a farder Nourrishing-vp of them therwith, in all Comblines and Modestie / vntill that they wax to be Youngmen.
6. Keepe them moreouer with all Diligence;

vnder your Pro. 13. 23. . Eccli. 30. a. Rod or Discipline: also accustome and exercise them euen from their Youth vp; to liue according to the Lawe of y^e Lorde: and humble alwayes their Heartes / Mindes / and Vnderstan|dinges, Tob. 1. a. Eph. 6. a. vnto the Feare of God.
7. Instruct, nourter, and exhort them also daylie for to stand-submitted vnto the good Nature of the Loue / and vnto the Math. 11. c. meekminded Beeing of our Lorde Iesus Christ.
8. HEer-in / and in all Equitie, exercise and  traine-vp daylie your Children: and let not in any-case, the Chasteonable-instruction Eccli. 30. a. ceasse ouer them / vntill that they in the Lawe of y^e Lorde / and in the Feare of God; haue obtained well Heb. 5. c. exer|cised Mindes / and are euenso with all wel-dispo|sed Obedience; attained or growen-vp vnto the Age and Vnderstanding of Youngmanship.
9. Howbeit, thys Chasteonable-instruction which serueth for the weaned Children; ought to be don with conuenient Distinction or approoued Dis|cretion / therafter as the Children are young or olde / great or little / vnderstanding or ignorant. and therafter as they are simple or wise in y^e Euell / to thende that they all may growevp aright with good Exercise; vnto the vpright Vnderstanding / and be nourrished and brought-vp to Children of the Kingdom / for to vnderstand the Instructions of the Wisdom / and the Prouerbes of the godlie Vnderstanding.

OYee Elders in the Wisdom / and  yee Fathers of y^e Howsholde in y^e Loue: Beare in any-wise; alwayes a singular care ouer your young Eccli. 7. .

Wanton-dallyers / or turne themselues to any Whordom / lest that they should bring or cause any Shame or Infamie, in the Fa|milie of Loue.
2. Teach them betimes out of Vnderstanding; to vse Pollicie or Prudent-warines against the Straungers, which com-vnto and assault them with subtill Fetches; for to spoile them of their Ho|nest-fame and Chastitie.
3. For-that-cause, yee shall daylie exhort your ioung Daughters to all Foresightfulnes: and teach them also to vse good Circumspection against the Whoremongers / to thend that they suffer not them selues by any meanes, to be defiled or dishonested: and nourrish or bring them vp euenso in all Fore|sightfulnes or Prudent-pollicie; vnto all Purenes of Life: and keepe them in all good Nourtour and Honest-behauiour / Eccli. 7. b. 1. Cor. 7. c. vntill that they with pure Bodies; be ioyned-together in the holie Matri|monie ordained by God; vnto their Husband.

Eccli. 1. 25. a. of the manlie Wisdom / the which the Man of God in the Elderdom Eph. 4. b. of the Man Christ; receaueth / or becometh crowned ther|withall: and what an vpright and louelie Conuer|sation or Beeing of sinceere Righteousnes, hee then inheriteth. and therto also, of the Kingdom of the God of Heauen / and of the spirituall and heauenlie Riches Math. 13. b. of the godlie Mysterie.
5. HEer-in now / and in such-like, exercise and trayne-vp your Youngmen or Those that are growing towardes Mans-estate: and confirme or establish them in the Nature of y^e Loue, with the godlie Wisdom of the Trueth of God

and Christ, and with the holie Vnderstanding of the holie Spirit of Loue.
6. Looke to them also and cause them with all  diligence, that they do daylie glasse and adourne or garnish themselues well in the Glasse of Righ|teousnes / to thende that they may Iam. 1. c. increase fourth|a-fourth, in the godlie Wisdom and vpright Righ|teousnes and Holines / til-vnto the perfect Olde|age of the holie Vnderstanding of Iesu Christ and of his holie Spirit of Loue.

Olde-age of the Man Christ, and that they profite or increase-them in the holie Vnderstanding of the holie Spirit of Loue / yee shall permit them to be conuersant with the El|ders of the holie and godlie Vnderstanding / and with the Counsaile-lordes in the Familie of Loue: also to talke of Wisdom and Righteousnes / and of the Mysterie of the Kingdom of the God of Hea|uens. to demaund or propone-question therof / to heare Math. 13. b.

8. In which godlie Speaches or Communica|tions  one with an-other, yee shall teach the Young|men, out of the Testimonies of the holie Spirit of Loue / to vnderstand the right difference, betwixt Death, Deut. 30. b. Eccli. 15. b. and Life / betwixt Darknes, and Light / betwixt the Destruction, and Preseruation / and be|twixt the Condemnation, and Saluation.
