TO EVERY SOVLE that seeketh after Trueth in humilitie: for God resi|steth the Proud, and giueth Grace to the Humble.
_OVR Sauiour fore-see|ing, that many (vnder the cloake of,Math. 2423 c. Going out of Babel) would go out of the Church, saying, Here is Christ, there is Christ; he chargeth his Folowers, not to be|leeue them: much lesse to goe out. This wickednesse is growen now so ex|cellent, as if the true Christ could not be found otherwhere, then without in Woods, Mikes, by-Stables, Barnes, and Hay-loftes; wherevpon, all the speach now, is, Goe out, goe out of Ba|bel, come into the secret places.
Math. 7.15.16. c Our Sauiour foreseeing, that Wol|uish-teachers should come to the people in Sheepes-skinnes (that is, in Sheepe|like conuersation,) and by such shee|pish outward moralitie, labour to couer their Woluish, pricking, Schismaticall Doctrine, (for Doctrine is the fruite there spoken of, their outward cariage being otherwise Sheepish,) he sayth to his true Folowers, Yee shall know them by their fruites: that is, you onely, that be indued with the true spi|rit of meekenes  lowlines, shall know them by theThis phrase is vsed in Pro|uerbs 10.21.31.  18.20.21. c. Fruite of their lippes, their schismaticall Doctrine. They shall haue the name of Prophets (a ve|rie good name) and their outward ca|riage shalbe like to Christes sheepe (a very commendable thing, and able to draw many) but examine once the fruite of their lippes, issuing from them as Prophets, Tunc Lupus est in fa|bula, t
hen he is a deuowring Wolfe; howsoeuer he say (as some did in Esaias

time) Stand apart, come not neere to mee, for I am holier then thou.Isai. 65.5. And of such sort (sayth the Apostle vnto Ti|mothy) are these,2. Tim. 3.6. which creepe into houses, and lead captiue simple wo|men laden with sinnes,  led with diuers lustes; which women are euer learning, and are neuer able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
The Spirit of Prophecie, hauing so plainely fore-prophesied of our times, and false-spirites, what are we, that we should be negligent in trying the spi|rits, whether they be of God? And see|ing that these spirituall Wolues, shall for their outwarde cariage and life, seeme to be Christes Sheepe and poore innocent Lambes (and for that, many times be more worthy reuerence, then some of the truest Teachers) it stan|deth people therefore vpon, not to be caryed with a few painted flimflams, but by the speare of Discretion, to gage the side of the Grecians wooden

Horse, for trying out, whether the in|wardes be not planted with engines of death. Latet anguis in herba; the fairest face hath not alwayes the truest heart. Satan in policie, would haue his Seminaries, in th'outwarde appea|rance, to excell Christes Ministers; that so, as them selues be deceiued, they may likewise deceiue others. As for the true Ministers of Christ, Satan must needs labour to spot them outwardly, seeing he cannot keepe backe the doct|rinall sappe of Gods spirit; which di|stilling from the lippes of the Teacher, is to beget and feed many.
Herevpon it is, that true Doctrine is often reiected, because of some ex|ternall want in the Teacher. And a|gaine, because of some excellent com|mendable outward things (in a Duck|frier, or a smooth Pharise,) any doct|rine is easily swallowed, be it schisma|ricall, hereticall, or trayterous: A plaine signe, that such people are yet

destitute of that spirit, whereby they should be able to try Doctrine, and dis|cerne Spirits. And not onely that, but also full of giddy passions, and head|strong affections; as wil appeare in the ensuing Dialogues: where the very naturall character of such spirits, is by mee set downe; not without sundrie yeares experience had of them all: as also with no small expences.
If thine heart be vn-hardned, it will easily ioyne with mee: If other|wise, yet herein I shall be comforted, that in this worke I haue serued God and his Church truly, though weakely. If something in the Conferrours seeme too light, consider first, it is but the naturall character of that spi|rit: and secondly, that it is but as a feeling of that spirites pulse, without any commoration or dwelling vp|pon it.
As I could, I haue done. If it please, it is that I pray for: if it displease any,

I shall (through Gods grace) not one|ly peaceably passe by it; but also, with patience awayte the change of their iudgement and affection. Farewell.
Thine as he may, He. Clapham.





THE FIRST DIALOGVE, Betweene Mal-content and Flyer.
Mal-content.

Mal-con|tent.
_WEll ouertaken Sir, how farre do you trauaile this way?

Flyer.

Flyer.
So farr as Grauesend.


Mal-con.
So doe I Sir: God blesse vs in our iornaie.


Flyer.
I cannot say Amen, to your Prayer.


Mal-con.
Why sir: Would you not be bles|sed in your iornaie?


Flyer.
Yes: but in saying Amen, to your Prayer, I should testifie my selfe to be one in spirituall communion with you. Whereas, if you be that Mal-content, which I sometimes haue seene at the Royal-exchange, you are a notable lim of Antichrist, and of all the Prote|stants, the most hipocriticall: for you

say,  do not. You say that the Church-gouernement in England is Antichri|stian; that is, opposite vnto the true Christ; and yet with Isachar you beare the burden of the Sonne of perdition, and say that rest is good, whereas you ought, for redemption of your soule, to Fly out of Babel.


Mal-con.
Pardon sir; I thinke I should know you: Is not your name M. Flyer?


Flyer.
It is: and I charge you in paine of damnation, to fly out of Babel.


Mal-con.
First, it is a question (sir) if so the Church of England may be truly cal|led Babel. Secondly, if so it should be prooued a Babel; the question is, whe|ther I may goe out of Babel without the Kinges leaue. First, for that Israel came not out of Aegipt, before Pha|raoh gaue them leaue. And secondly, for that the lewes came not out of Ba|bel, till Cyrus gaue them leaue. I pray you (sir) therefore, let mee heare what you can say: first, for the proouing it Babel: secondly, for our lawfull flight from it


Flyer.
O sir Mal-content, haue not you

your selfe taught in word and writing, specially in your suites to Parliament, that the true gouernment of Christ Ie|sus (consisting in Pastors, Doctors, Elders, Deacons and Wydowes) is lacking; and that Antichrist in the roome thereof, hath foysted in the go|uernment of Arch-bishops, Lord Bi|shops. c. who with their long-swords do keepe out the Ordinances of Christ Iesus? Haue you not so taught and written:


Mal. con|tent.
Indeed, I thinke I so writ once in a Sermon vpon Rom. 12.6, 7, 8. and in some of my Petitions to the Parlia|ment. c.


Flyer.
In your. c. you may vnderstande many other Bookes, the most of your publique Sermons; and specially your Conuenticles in secret, where your pri|uat Disciples might priuately applaud you. And if you remember, I was one of your Classis, when in Cambridge you (in secret) chattred out that Ser|mon vpon Rom. 12. which afterwardes was published without name; because (it seemeth) you were not minded, for

it publiquely to take up Christs crosse, and so to follow him.


Mal-con.
You Flyers, be exceeding harsh in your censures.


Flyer.
And you sir Mal-content, exceeding doble in your dealinges. But to come to the poynt: doe you not stand a mem|ber of that Church, whose gouernment is Antichristian?


Mal-con.
What if I doe?


Flyer.
Then you are a member of Anti|christ, and all your Prayers and Prea|chinges but so many badges of the Beast: and all accursed.


Mal-con.
But it may be, I stand no ordinarie member of that Church.


Flyer.
Are you a member of the Church of England, yea or no


Mal-con.
A member I am, but no Ordinarie member. For though I sometimes heare some man preach that is but oc|casionally, as a man passing by some Scolds, might occasionally giue them a while the hearing. And as for the sacrament of Communion, I neuer meddle with it; because Righteousnes can haue no fellowship with vnrighte|ousnes:

and so I am no ordinarie mem|ber.


Flyer.
O monstrous hypocrisie, with your two-peny-ordinary. Was it euer heard of in the Bible, that a man should be a member  not a member of a Church; which you call a member not-ordinary. So I may be a member of the Church of Rome, a member of Mahomets Si|nagogue, and of whom not. It this be not a Babel, a Confusion of men and manners, what then can bee? But an|swere to this question: Under whose gouernment are you, whiles you are in a parish Church, hearing a Preacher of the Bishops ordination?


Mal-con.
To speake the trueth, vnder the re|giment of Antichrist.


Flyer.
Are you not there held for a Subiect to the sayd Antichristian regiment?


Mal-cont
The most (it may be) doe: but (it may be) that some there know that my heart is against their doinges.


Flyer.
So, the good testimonie which you should seeke for of men, doth rest vpon, It may be, it may be. It may be you may leaue this halting; but I know

not when. The Prophet Daniel had not this subtiltie, when (though he did well) he would not be thought of any, to do euill, as omitting duetie of prayer to God. Hananiah, Azariah, and Mi|shael, could (by your Religion) haue bowed before the Idoll, and notwith|standing haue sayd, that their heartes were against it: and one of them could haue borne witnesse of anothers good meaning. But they had learned, that both body and soule were bought with a price (euen with the blood of the im|maculate Lambe) and therefore they must glorifie God in both. Trueth is naked, and seekes none of these corners. But tell me, I pray you: If the King should giue all his Subiects leaue, to forsake all communion with the Con|fused people, leitourgie and gouerne|ment of the Church of England, would you not for sake them all, and betake you presently to that Church whereof I am a member?


Mal-cont
Indeed, I should. And that is the maine point in truth, the King not gi|uing leaue to come out of this Aegypt,

this spirituall house of bondage.


Flyer.
Mal-content, You tearme your Church uery fitly, A spirituall house of bondage. And because Spirituall, therefore not to be fraied in till y^e King giue leaue to goe out. Do more then the Theefe, Adulterer, or Durtherer, is to stay in his sinne, till the King bid him go out. And yet these euils against the second Table onely; whereas the other is hypocrisie in Religion, and flat Idolatrie against the first Table of the orall law, which commaundeth Ho|lynesse towardes God, as the second inioyneth Righteousnesse towardes man. Though Daniel, Hananiah, Azariah, Mishael, and their brethren, might not depart Babel  them coastes, till y^e King gaue leaue; yet they might, ought, and did depart from their Idola|trie and false worship, howsoeuer their Godyes (for testifying against it) were ardly intreated, and still kept in corpo|all bondage.


Mal-con.
Mee thinkes (M. Flyer) you now uch your selfe, who departes the Kinges territories, and your owne









natiue land, which is more, for plan|ting a Church amonst a people of Ezek. 3.6. hard language. For which respect, a principall Norwich-man of your sect, hath helde you for a true Church, while yee were in your owne Nation. But departing once the limits of your owne language, he hath taught, that so ye apostate from Fayth and Chari|tie, and to be no true Church. I thinke you cannot answere him.


Flyer.
If I could not, yet that is no excuse for your standing in spirituall euil. But I pray you, did not Elias fly in time of persecution? Did not our Sauiour so, and teach his Apostles to do so:


Mal-con
True, but no flight to continue with any people, whose language they vnderstood not: much lesse, there to plant a Church.


Flyer.
Well, for that poynt I am not yet studied: I will aske councell about it: Meane time, looke you to your win|ding and doubling, euen against the light of your minde, and confession of your mouth.


Mal-con.
Nay, we haue (some of vs) moe ex|ceptions

against you. For you can|not be contented onely to depart from vs, but you condemne euery soule of our Church, for a lim of the sonne of Perdition, and so to stand visibly in the state of damnation: Whereas you know well enough, that many of vs grone vnder the bur|den of sinne, and do striue after that is good.


Flyer.
Mal-content, Mal-content, you must not onely grone vnder sinne, but grieue at it, and fly from it, as I, and others haue: who as Hee-goates be|fore the Flocke, haue gone foorth, with our faces towardes Sion.


Mal-con.
Besides (M. Flyer,) in the writings you publish, you fill all the Mar|gines with allegations from Scrip|ture, and the most to none, or to a ly|ing purpose. As to giue one in|stance. It is held of you and vs, that the new Testament hath his peculiar forme of Church-gouernment, giuen by Christ; and that the old Testament hath his peculiar gouernment, giuen by Moses. And yet for proofe of

Christes Discipline and Institutions, you quote Scriptures from the olde Testament, which planely establish the Mosaicall orders. A seconde in|stance may be this: Such Scriptures as speake of the inuisible Church (kno|wen to God, for holy and vnspotted) you quote for probatio~ of the visible Church her state and constitution, which you intende must be Visibly all holy and vnspotted in this life. If such allegation of Scripture, be not a nota|ble taking of Gods name in vaine, I then vnderstand nothing.


Flyer.
First, let it be so: It shall be but as some of you haue done before vs. Let the Recordes be searched. Secondly, when the particulars shalbe by you, or any your side produced, we shall giue in, a reasonable answere.


Mal-con.
Nay sir, which is more. M. Henrie Barrow drawing a Description of the true Church when he comes to deliuer the Canons of discipline he in that sheete of Paper, doth after the Excommunica|tion, place that Canon of the Apostle, in 2. Thess. 3.15. Yet count him not as an

enimie, but admonish him as a brother, be|cause he beleeued, that excommuni|cation was a power to edification, not to destruction. Your Congrega|tion then, some yeares after his death, do reprint it, putting to it the olde date, corrupting his method, falsify|ing his Will, by placing the sayd Ca|non before Excommunication; be|cause after the casting out, you would rid your handes of all tendernes and compassion, as delighting in nothing more, then in bitternesse against the soule distressed. The Apostle can say,Gala. 3.1 Though it be but a mans Couenant (or Will) when it is confirmed, no man doth abrogate it, or addeth any thing thereto. But you haue done that which No man (that is, no honest man) would doe, in so causing his Will to speake contrary to his meaning.


Flyer.
Mal-content, I cannot beleeue that thou sayest.


Mal-con.
But I beleeue it, and the Copies will prooue it. Besides that, I know him which reprooued that euill, at the comming foorth of the second Aedi|tion

at A. at the charges of Arthur Bllet. Whereas the first was printed at D. where other Writings also of the same man, were then printed. But in a word (M. Flyer) there be diuers of vs are minded eare long, to leaue the Church of England; but with these prouisoes: First, to ioyne with your congregation we dare not, and that because of the many bloody vnre|pentant censures lying vpon the neck of your Church, as M. G. Io. hath layde downe plainely in his Booke against your Societie: Secondly, in departing the Church of England We are minded notwithstanding, to hold many of them, Disciples to the true
Christ; and so doubtlesse, wee shall finde some succour from them.


Flyer.
I thought (Mal-content) thou wouldst discouer thine hypocrisie. Thy flying from Babel, shalbe yet with ap|plauding some in Babel, that so out of Babel thou mayst haue some mainte|naunce. I see that thou art in the gall of bitternesse, and in the band of iniqui|tie. Either hold the Church of Eng|land

(as the sayd Protestant doth) for a true Church, with some wantes; for which notwithstanding, the Church is not to be forsaken: or, hold with vs. A true Church it was neuer: or if some time it were, it now is no more a true Church, then y^e Church of Rome. Halt not therefore betweene two opinions. If Iehouah be y^e Lord, follow him but if Baal be the Lord, then follow him.


Mal-con.
Maister Flyer, I neither hold your side for Iehouah, nor the Church of England for Baal. But for your side, I hold it as an Errour on the right hand; and the other side, as an Errour on the left hand: In mdio quorum consist virtus, In midst whereof I stand, and betweene which I meane to walke.


Flyer.
Mal-content, thou wouldst faine alke betweene the barke and tree, and ot be pincht. Thou wouldst be one ith vs (as afore) if the King would iue thee leaue; and now we are, as an rrour on the right hand. Againe, thou  one of these dayes, without the inges leaue, take leaue of the Popish Antichristian gouernement, and yet

iustifie many bearing that marke of the Beast in hand  forehead, for Disciples of the true Christ. Iwis, thou holdes thou knowes not what; and they be se|duced that swallow thy doctrine. But be thou, and some, as yee shall, I haue no small hope, that thousands in Eng|land (that now stand on the tiptoe) will ere long, fall flatly on our side. Heare you not of Teachers and people, in the farthest partes of Lincolne-shire and Nottingham-shire, c. who are flatly already seperated.


Mal-con.
I heard of it th' other day, by a Lon|don-Preacher; who sorroweth much for a Gentlewoman of place, who is sayd, to be absolutely gone from the Church. But as I know some of them Teachers, and specially him that is sayd there to haue baptized one of their Children in a Barne: so, my hope is, that their Seperation is not so far as yours, but one with that which I purpose.


Flyer.
You purpose you know not what. Besides that, moe, and new indes of Seperation, will cause the -Prote|stant

to be more stiffe in his standing: and the Time-seruer will thereby take occasion to stout at vs all.


Mal-con.
Then come backe vnto vs.


Flyer.
Nay, come you forwarde vnto vs, and so become more perfect. But stay, is not this Grauesend hard by?


Mal-con.
It is.


Flyer.
Then be we husht, for feare some ouer-heare vs, that may giue intelli|gence to the crabbed Searchers. For the trueth is, I am with the next wind, to goe to Sea, and I feare none beere, so much as that kind of cattle and busy|body, prying into this, and peering in|to that: that a man can hardly haue a Swordes scabberd lined with French|crownes bowed, as D. Arthur Billet had; or an olde clumperton paire of Shooes, whose soles be lyned with Angels, as my brother George Clay|ton the Brick-layer had, but they will either by a priuie search finde them; or the feare a man shalbe put vnto (while they be about these) will be so terrible, as a sicknesse worse then the Sea-sick|nesse) will sodainely surprize him.



Mal-con.
Were it not at the first, you denied co~munion with me in Prayer (which makes me suspect you disdaine all fel|lowship with me at Table) I would willingly inuite you to a ioynt of Meate and a pint of Wine, before our parting.


Flyer.
For that sir, it is but felowship Ci|uill; whereas the other is Spirituall. We may eate  drinke with a Turke, but not pray with a Turke.


Mal-con.
Will it please you then (sir) to take a Dinner with me?


Flyer.
I will, and I thanke God for it; who will haue Elias fed, if but by the ministerie of an vncleane Rauen.


Mal-con.
Doe you then hold me vncleane? and yet the Rauen (I take it) was not vncleane till he was dead.


Flyer.
In your present standing, you are dead in sinne; and you, and all your actions vncleane.


Mal-con.
Are we so? Then doubtlesse the Cooke is vncleane, and the Victuals vncleane; and you by eating them, should be vncleane: and therefore, go shake your eares for your Dinner.

And if you doe further prouoke mee, it is like I shall make the Searchers acquainted with you and your cleane Nobles: And yet they, being coyned by men vncleane, they shalbe vn|cleane also.. Packe and be quiet, for feare I prouoke some to shaue you of all your vncleannesse.



THE SECOND DIALOGVE Betweene Flyer and Anabaptist.

Anabapt.
HOW farre do you trauaile, sir?


Flyer.
No further then Middle|burghe, to night.


Anabapt.
You come newly from Sea, doe you not?


Flyer.
Uerily I doe. And happy it was for the Shippe (as a Marchants factour could lately say) that I was in it: for had not I longed earnestly after Zion; and according to Gods decree, were predestinated before all worldes, to

come safely vnto the true Church plan|ted in these partes, as the Factor could say, all the Ship had been cast away.


Anabapt.
What true Church is it (sir) which you meane is planted in these partes?


Flyer.
Certaine Englishmen, separated from the Whore of Babilon: I meane the Church in England.


Anabapt.
Fro~ the Protestants Church, meane you?


Flyer.
The very same. My heart leapes to thinke how farre I am got from the skirtes of that proude bloody Fornica|trix. Are you a Duch-man, that you can parlie so in English?


Anabap.
I am; and sometimes was a mem|ber of the Dutch-church that is in Norwich: But God opening mine eyes, to see the falsehoode of that Church, I forsooke it, and came so in|to these partes, to liue with a Congre|gation purely christian.


Flyer.
What, with our people I pray you?


Anabapt.
There be certaine English people of vs, that came out from the Brownistes.


Flyer.
From the Brownistes? Whya, they be the people that I come to. But I

pray you, let me admonish you of one thing: Leaue that tearme of Brownist, for they despise Brownes standing, I tell you.


Anabapt.
Yea, they despise his present stan|ding, for that he is returned to the Church of England; but meane time, they haue slapt vp his Vomite, and maintaine the blind Schisme he made from that Church.


Flyer.
Call you it a blind Schisme? Blind they be not, that see the Holy thinges they see. Nor Schisme is it; but a faythfull departure from Babel.


Anabapt
Babel? You know not what abel meanes; for they be a people ouer head and eares in Babel: so farre from being fled from it.


Flyer.
Prooue that, and Ile leaue my Re|ligion.


Anabapt.
You leaue it? You may say, if God will giue you the Grace to leaue it: For it is a peculiar Grace to leaue So|dome and Aegipt, spiritually so called.


Flyer.
It is trueth you say. But I pray you, Of what Religion may you be?


Anabapt.
Of the true Christian Religion;

commonly tearmed Anabaptisme, Tro~ our baptizing of people againe, com|ming from the false Church; whereof your Congregation is a maine arro|gant member.


Flyer.
I tremble to thinke, that you should dare so to blaspheme the Tabernacle pight of God, and not of man.


Anabapt.
Pight of the Diuell and the Anti|christian Man. Let mee spurre you one question; Are you Baptized?


Flyer.
That I am, I thanke God.


Anabapt.
Who Baptized you?


Flyer.
A Minister of the English Church. And (I thanke God) it was done with a Sermon, and without the Crosse in the forehead.


Anabap.
Are the Ministers of England, true Ministers?


Flyer.
No; they be slaues to Antichrist, in all his inuentions.


Anabapt.
Marke what a foole you be; neither call I you foole Vnaduisedly. You se|perate from Babel, and yet iustifies the ministeriall action; of the Mini|sters of Babel. Can they be Antichri|stian Ministers, and their essentiall

ministeriall actions Christian? Hath Christ appoynted any limme of the Beast to keepe his Signet, and to seale his people with Baptisme? Hath Christ giuen power vnto any to Bap|tize, to whom he sayth not first, Goe and teach? Will the Ministers of Anti|christ, seale vnto the true Christ?


Flyer.
Though they and their places be Antichristian, yet the Baptisme may be Christian.


Anabap.
Once againe, if happily God may bring you out of that misterie of in|iquitie: Was the Minister him selfe, first a true Christian before he entred into that function?


Flyer.
No for he was a lim of that Beastes body.


Anabap.
Did his ministerie then make him a true Christian?


Flyer.
At no hand, being a Minister in the body of the same Beast.


Anabap.
He being neither a true Minister, nor so much as a true Christian; and your selfe also, a member of the same Antichrist, How could you by his Baptisme become a true Christian?

Out of a bitter Fountaine, can there come any sweete Water? As the first fruites are, are not also the branches?


Flyer.
I was no true Christian then, nor it any true Baptisme: but now being se|parated from them (as these of the Ten Tribes which came vnto Iuda.) My Baptisme is good, as their Circumci|sion then became good.


Anabapt.
English-man, the Comparison is not alike. They of Israel were com|maunded to circumcise; but no Mi|nister of Antichrist is commaunded to Baptize. The Israelites were a peo|ple, that had been a true constituted Church; but as your selues say, Eng|land was neuer constituted of, or to the Lord. Thirdly, any Israelite might circumcise his Childe: but in your opinion, a Preacher of the word may onely doe that. Till therefore, you can prooue, that the English Minister, did but the commaundement of God in Baptising, as the Israelite did it in Cir|cumcising, you may goe with the Beastes marke in your forehead, as old and young in your Church carry

it. But come wee to another poynt. e you hold that Christ, which your iptian Priestes did teach you?


Flyer.
Yes verily; and by Gods helpe so I will.


Anabap.
And yet you are come out of Babel. Can they that teach people dayly the true Christ be Ministers of Antichrist Are they not true ministers that teach and seale to the true Christ Or if they  false Ministers (which you graunt) must not their principall felsehood en lie, first in teaching a false Christ; and secondly, in sealing to the false Christ? That is, the Ministers can not be Antichristian, but they must direct d signe the people vnto Antichrist, vnder a cullour of Christ,) and that onely can be the mysterie of iniqui|tie. But another question: By what eanes seeke ye to be one with your Christ?


Flyer
By Fayth onely; which is wrought  my heart, by the outward ministerie  the word, and the inward operation  Gods spirit.


Anabap.
Silly, silly: Can you call these Mi|nisters

of Antichrist, whom you de|fende for such, as haue not onely (a you say) taught you the true Christ but also, lead you by the true meanes vnto that true Christ. Thus the blinde hath led the blinde, and both tumble in the ditch. Either make the Tre good, and his fruite good; or make it bad, and his fruite bad. O friend! I muse not, though you stand amazed I my selfe was sometimes in such  strait; but he that gaue me simpliciti of heart, gaue mee to wind out of tha Laborinth. Iohn could not see the mysterie of that Beast in the Apocalips, till he went out into the Desart. God might (for your lynsi-wolsie Fayth) haue cast you away in the Sea; but in mercie he hath reserued you vnto a better hower. He did not cast me in|to your way for nothing; I hope fo a blessing, though otherwise in your perishing, I should become a good fauour vnto God. Thou in the Hea|uens, take the Scales away from his eyes, that he may see into the end of thinges that are
 to be abolished.



Flyer.
Me thinkes it should be true, that the ues of Satan, should onely serue atan in their ministrie, as the Gally|aues with Ores, do serue the Turkes Lieftenant.


Anabapt.
A very good comparison: whose Seruant one is, his workes they doe. For no one can serue two Maisters, specially, so crosse as Christ and An|tichrist.


Flyer.
I pray you sir, then what be the Ar|cles of your fayth?


Anabap.
For that friend, remember what is written in Ezek. 43.11. When they be ashamed of all that they haue done, shew em the forme of the house, and the pat|rne thereof, and the going out thereof, and he comming in thereof, and all the fashion thereof, and all the ordinaunces thereof. c. ploying thus much, that the Holy mysteries are not to be reuealed, but nely to such a soule as is first asha|ed of all by-pathes of false worship. or the Childrens Bread is not to be st vnto Dogs, that will ball against e trueth; nor Pearles vnto Hogs, at wallow in their owne shame.



Flyer.
I am ashamed of my standing; not only with the Protestant, but also with the Separist and Priuate: and I firme|ly betake my selfe to your Fayth, till death vs depart.


Anabapt.
The Deaw of heauen come vpon you. To morrow I will bring you in|to our sacred Congregation, that so you may come to be informed in the Fayth, and after that, to be purely Baptized.


Flyer.
Thankes reuerend man of God. I thinke sir, you are some Minister your selfe?


Anabapt.
That word Minister, fitteth not. I am a Prophet of the Lord, spoken of in the eleuenth of the Reuelation, which in homely apparaile (as Sackcloth) doe bewayle the peoples sinnes, pro|testing against the Beast, that come out of the bottomlesse Pitte. And (as I had in vision this night) the Beast in time, shall put mee to death, for the Holy testimonie: But an Angell hath comforted mee, and sayth, that be|fore that time, I shall turne the hearts of many Fathers to the Children;

and the heartes of Children to the Fathers; least otherwise the great power should smite the Earth with cursing.


Flyer.
O sir, mee thinkes the spirit of life is entred hote into mee. Mee thinkes I could leape into that passage-Cart, and prophecie Fire vpon England and all English Sectaries.


Anabapt.
Stay holy Proselite, thou must first be Baptized and haue some diuine Vision from aboue. And so being made a perfect Emusiast, thou shalt be able to turne backe the Floodes of Iordane. But stay, one is at our heeles. If wee fall into any talke of Religion, lay you your hand of your mouth, and be silent.


Flyer.
I will, O miraculous Prophet.




THE THIRD DIALOGVE Betweene Anabaptist and the Legatine-Arrian.

Legatine-Arrian.
WEll ouer-taken Father; goe you vnto Midleburghe?


Anabap.
I doe sir.


Legat. ar.
I would be glad of your company: and so much the rather, for that you are gray-headed; and Moses commaundeth such Youth as I am, to rise vp before t gray-headed.


Anabap.
Thou sayst well sonne; and I am glad thou readest Moses with some obseruance.


Legat. ar.
Without such diuine reading and obseruatio~, Man is worse then a Dog. What religion are you of, Father?


Anabapt.
Of the true Christian religion.


Legat. ar.
Professed according to what, what forme, Father? For the Papistes pro|fesse

him according to one forme, the Protestants after another forme: and so the Puritaines, Brownistes, Anabap|tistes, and others.


Anabapt
I professe him (sonne) after that manner, which is reuiled by the name of Anabaptistes; though Ana-baptisme or R-baptization, is a thing we be not ashamed of, but rather glory in; as hauing onely power from the Lord, to deliuer that seale of Baptisme.


Legat. ar.
Are you Baptized then?


Anabapt.
I am sonne.


Legat. ar.
And I am of minde, that there is no true Baptisme vpon the earth.


Anabapt.
Not in the earth? I pray thee sonne say not so. The coegation I am of, can, and doth administer true Bap|tisme.


Legat. arr.
Say you so Father? Your congre|gation (as appeareth in Sleydan) is but, as of the last day. Was not the true Church (according to S. Iohns. Uision in the Reuelation) to be for ma|nie yeares inuisible, and not to be seene in the earth?


Anabapt.
That is certainely true. And so I

thinke, my Brother that heere wal|keth with vs, (your countryman, for|sooth) is accordingly minded.


Flyer.
I am.


Legat. ar.
I am of the same minde; and there|fore conclude therevpon thus: The Church being to be latent and inuisible for many yeares, so that her place was no more to be found; it must according|ly follow, that there could be no more a visible Church, till some notable men were surred vp of God, to raise it a|gaine out of the dust.


Anabapt.
I graunt that: And notable men haue we had.


Legat. ar.
The men that began the frame of the Church of Israel, were Moses and Aaron. The men that began the New|testaments Church, were the Apostles. All these were furnished with the guift of Myracles, for the perswading of their hearers: For without Myracle, they could not be beleeued to come from God, for establishing a new Church-pollicie. Now Father, who were the first layers of your Churches foundation? They must bring Myra|cles

with them, or who (but mad-men) will take them for new Founders?


Anabapt.
My sonne, wee haue had sundry men, that haue been myraculous.


Legat. arr.
Indeed, Sleidan recordeth your Snapper-doling, and some others, that were marueilous for their Dreames; wherevpon they practised all filthines and intollerable bloodshed. But to passe by that, and the like: Of whom had the first of your people his Bap|tisme? The first had it (doubtlesse) in the Church of Rome, and so conse|quently from Antichrist: and Adam the first, being impure, we that follow, can be no better. As is the first fruite, so be the branches. New Baptisme there can not be, till there come new Apostles. New Apostles there can not be, who are not endued (from aboue) with myracles. Myracles we heare of none, (onely of idle Dreames) and so consequently, no true Baptisme in the earth, nor any one true visible Chri|stian.


Anabapt.
Doe you not beleeue your selfe to be one?



Legat. arr.
Not: for alter an vtter ceassing of visible Christianitie, there can be no raysing vp of that worke to visible ap|pearance, till Ministers haue begun it, who may by Myracle confirme their calling. For not our Sauiour Christ, would so much as abolish the Shadow and establish the Substaunce, but he would first vnto the people, cleare his calling, by an effectuall declaration of Myracles. And what are you, that you should be beleeued of your bare words?


Anabap.
I perceiue sonne, that thou art a|gainst all Churches, and all Churches against thee, as was the hand of flou|ting Israel, turned out of Abrahams house, the father of beleeuers.


Legat. ar.
You are au old Dunse, to liken mee vnto Ismael, a figure of Reprobates. For you and others once graunting, that y^e Church (according to that in the Reuelation, chap. 6.14. represented by the Heauens) departing once away, as a Scrowle when it is rowled; must needes therevpon conclude, that there could be no more a true A beeing. Esse of the Church, till (from God) some myra|culous

Ministerie, should breath new life into the people; as of Stones ray|sing vp Children vnto Abraham.


Anabapt.
A true Esse, What is that? I hold my life, it is somewhat of the Romane beastes language.


Legat. arr.
I despise the seauen headed Mon|ster more then you. Neither care I a straw for Hebrew, Greeke, or La|tine: for (thankes to his diuine Maie|stie) I neuer was an Uniuersity-man, much lesse an Academicall Diuine, or Theologue; nor haue I troubled my selfe about the Beastes tongue. Only, as in reasoning I haue bin pressed with such a word, I haue obserued it, for slaying (another time) the Medianite with his owne sword.


Anabapt.
Fowle Heretike; I would thou knew it, I hate this prophane lear|ning and language, so well as thou. I am a Prophet of the true Church, and yet get my lyuing by making of Swordes, the first calling I was tray|ned in.


Legat. ar.
Whia, sir foole, you hold the Magi|strate, to be onely an Ordinaunce (since

Christes time) without the Church; and that the vse of the Sword is vn|lawfull. You therefore in making Swordes, doe vphold Bloodshed and Warres, which otherwise you hold vn|lawfull: And so a raucke hypocrite.


Anabap.
Sawcie princocks, the Apostle hath charged vs, to walke in the same cal|ling, wherein we were called to be Christians: but when I was called to be a Christian, I was a Sword-maker; therefore in that called I ought to continue.


Legat. ar.
Gray head, and greene minde; by like proportion I reason thus. The Apstle commaundes a man to walke in the same calling a man was of, when he was called to Christianitie: But when I was called vnto Christianitie, my calling was to keepe an Whore|house; therefore, being now called to be a Christian, I ought yet to keepe an Whore-house. Country-man, take heede of him: for, vnder his paine ha|bite, voyde of Silke, Ueluet, and Pearse, (and yet, I warrant thee, of as softly English cloth, as his Purse

could purchase) there lurketh all coun|terfaite dealing. He would be thought most aduerse to the Romanistes, and yet in the doctrines of Predestination, Freewill, Iustification, (mayne fun|damentall poyntes) he iumpeth one with them: besides that execrable He|resie, that Christ had a Corporall na|ture from Heauen, not from vs; where|vpon must necessarily follow, that then he could neuer satisfie Gods iustice for vs.


Anabapt.
Heauens-power, how great is thy lenitie, in bearing with such blasphe|mie! Faythfull Proselite, hanke in thine eare,  come to me there to night, or tomorrow morning, and thou shalt be inspired from aboue, with power to resist all the deuises of such Charmers, charme they neuer so wittily. Farewell deare Proselite, for I will trudge before, least my eares be|come receptacles of his vnhallowed breathinges.




THE FOVRTH DIALOGVE, betweene the Flyer and Legatine-arrian.

Legatine-arrian.
DEare Countryman, may I be so bold, as to inquire, where|fore you came into these parts?


Flyer.
Good sir, to speake the truth, I came from the Separistes in Lon|don, with full purpose to ioyne with that Church of them, which is in these partes: But meeting with this man, as I came from Flushen where I lan|ded, and discoursing with him about Religion, I verily resolued to ioyne with him and his Congregation. But perceiuing by your Dialoguizing with him, that all is meere foolerie, to be|leeue, that either Hee, or Brownist, or Mal-content, is of any true Church; yea, that there can be no Christian com|munion,

till a myraculous Ministerie be stirred vp of God, for baptising peo|ple, and calling them into Christian communion; I herevpon, haue giuen him the bagge. Fish where he shall, he shall haue no Fish of mee. And there|fore (good sir) seeing it pleased the Almightie to saue mee myraculously from seas (and I perceiue it was, for keeping mee to be instructed of you,) my humble desire is, to vnderstande of you, what a soule is to doe in this case, there being not onely, no true visible Church on the earth, but also, no true visible Christian? I beseech you pray for mee, or else I know not what shall become of mee.


Legat. ar.
Pray for you I may; but pray with you I may not. Prayer with one, is an action of communion, (as for exam|ple, if I should say, Our Father, Giue Vs this day our bread; Forgiue Vs our sinnes, Lead not Vs into temptation:) this should imply, that you and I were in com|munion or christian fellowship. But before that myraculous Ministerie (as afore) shall come and gather the





Gentiles into such communion, and Elias come for calling the Iewes, there can be no such fellowship; and there|fore no such prayer. When I come at my Chamber, I will pray for you.


Flyer.
I pray you sir, let me next Sabaoth day, haue accesse vnto your Congrega|tion: for, I doubt not, but you haue some Congregation heere in Zeland.


Legat. ar.
How sillily you speake. I haue all this while taught you, that there is no Church, nor visible Christian in the world as yet; seeing no myraculous Apostles haue yet been sent to Bap|tize people, and call them into com|munion, and you talke of a Church. Besides, it is a notable badge of Anti|christ, for any christian Congrega|tion, vpon the Sabaoths conuention, (or any other time of the Churches meeting) to admit of any vnbeleeuer or stranger to the fayth, vnto the Pa|storall exercise: For, is it not written in 1. Cor. 14.22. Prophecie serueth not for them that beleeue not, but for them which beleeue.


Flyer.
Then I perceiue, that all such, as I

haue left behinde me, haue serued An|tichrist in hypocrisie; for they suffer any Infidell to come vnto their exer|cise of Prophecie, or Preaching. But my Countrimen the Flyers, haue here|in sinned aboue all: for they permit in|fidelious Marchantes and others, to come on the Thurseday vnto their ex|ercise of Prophecie, when (ten to one) by reason of some brabling canse then to be pleaded, the Congregation mee|teth, ayeth, and departeth, without any Prayer at all, or exercise of their propheticall guites.


Legat. arr.
Propheticall guiftes; Propheticall fooleries. Tom Lace-seller, and Abra|ham Pin-seller (so I thinke M. Henry Barrow spoke in the Fleete) must come out and spatter their meaninges; and this must be called the exercise of Prophecie.


Flyer.
O excellent man of God, I am sory that we be come not into the tayle of Midleburghe: for that will brake off our Discourse.


Legat. arr.
O prophane speach: you should haue sayd, into the Suburbs of Midle|burghe.



Flyer.
The word Suburbs, I tooke to be  word of Latine, and so, of the Beastes language; which made me to auoyde it.


Legat. ar.
Therein I commende your zeale. For in their Translations, they can|not be contented to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? but be|fore it, they must put downe their prophane Latine, Elj, Elj, lamasab|thenj. Nor can be contented to say; God hath sent the spirit of his Sonne to cry, Father; but they must turne it, Abba father. At Amsterdam I once checked a Preacher that is now in England, for such fooleries; and he sayd, that it was so in the Origenall: but I will neuer beleeue it.


Flyer.
No sir: these limmes of Antichrist are not to be beleeued.


Legat. ar.
Hold you there; and I will assure you to become an excellent Diuine in short time. But we are come vnto the Citie: Where meane you to lodge?


Flyer.
I haue Letters to deliuer vnto some English-factors, and they be to supply mee with necessaries. But tell mee

where I may find you to morrow mor|ning, and I will be early with you?:


Legat. ar.
Harken then  come thi|ther early, and there you shall haue me: But by eight of the clocke, I pur|pose to set towards Camphere (a league of; that is, some three English myles) and so I will teach you a Mysterie touching Christ, which you neuer learned.


Flyer.
I thanke you sir: and I will wil|lingly attende.



THE FIFT DIALOGVE; First, betweene the Flyer and the Legatine-arrian: secondly, be|tweene the Legatine-arrian and the Familist.

Flyer.
GOod morrow sir, are you setting on your iorney?


Legat. ar.
I am: But I want meanes yet, for conueying a Bundle of Listes.



Flyer.
Doe you then deale in Cloth-listes? I haue heard, that it is a very good Marchandize. Well sir, if they be no moe then these, I can easily carry them vnder my Cloake.


Legat. ar.
I thanke you for it: you shall so saue me a few Styphers.


Flyer.
I haue coucht them vnder my arme very well. Let vs now set on our way. And I pray you sir, now discourse of the Christ, as you last night promised.


Legat. ar.
I will. If you marke all the limmes of Antichrist (whether Papist, or Pro|testant, or Anabaptist) you shall find them ignoraunt (euery of them) of the true Christ. The Papist and Protestant, doe hold him God and Man: So doth the Anabaptist; but with a difference. The first hold, that he is very God essentially; and very Man of man essentially. Yet seeing the word (Essentially) seemeth to be deriued of the Beastes language, I will rather vse the word, Substantially.


Flyer.
And I thinke sir, that that word sa|uours somewhat of Romulus; for I remember, that in their Latine Gram|mer,

there is, Substantinum hic hc hoc.


Legat. ar.
O, you begin to abounde with the true Spirit, that will lead you into all trueth. But Country-man, as the Apo|stle could not sayle thorow the Seas, but in the Shippe whose badge was the prophaine Castor and Pollux; so, neither can wee sayle thorow these Discourses, but in wordes stamped with the Image of the Beast.


Flyer.
O most excellent Theologue, I ne|uer obserued that comparison.


Legat. ar.
You shall heare more excellent thinges then these. How the Prote|stant and Papist doe hold Christ, wee haue learned at home. Now for the Dowper, that is, the Anabaptist, he hol|deth him very God, passing through the Virgins wombe (as Wind through a pipe) taking nothing of our nature, (because then he should be a sinner) but bringing a bodily substance with him from Heauen: whether fetcht out of the Fathers diuine substaunce, or out of the Angels spirituall sub|staunce, or out of the Heauens sub|staunce, they know not. But the very

trueth is, Hee is to be held a meere Man, as was Peter, Paul, or I: Onely, whereas we haue the Spirit in mea|sure, and were borne in sinne; hee had the Spirit beyond measure, and was borne free from sinne. As for the Scriptures tarming him sometimes,
GOD, it intendeth not his Essence, but his office; and you know, that in such respect, the Magistrate is called God. And herewith all let me tell you, how lately in England, I gaue a Magistrate the bagge. I being con|uented before him, he beginnes to puffe, he strokes vp his forehead, and then sotted out this question. Syrrha, doe you hold, that Iesus Christ is but meere man as I, or an other man is? To whom I answered: They ab|use mee, and haue abused your eares, that haue reported any such thing of mee. Then (quoth he againe) doe you deny Christ to be God? To whom I answered, No sir; I do verily beleeue that he is God Doe you so? That doe I, (quoth I.) Then (quoth he) thou art of mine owne Religion: Fare-fall, thy

heart, for so satisfying mee, and my learned Brother here: Goe thy wayes, thou art an honest-man I warrant thee. And so was I quickly dispat|ched. The foolish Flat-cap thought, that by my graunting Christ to be God, I had meant as he meant; name|ly, God by Nature: whereas I meant, God by Office.


Flyer.
O notable learning: rare learning.


Legat. ar.
Now sir it being meere Man that sinned, it must be meere Man that must satisfie Gods iustice: and there|fore at first preached, That the Wo|mans seed should breake the Serpents head. As also, that Hee should be a Seed deriued from Abram, from Da|ui, from the Fathers: which accor+dingly in his time came to passe, and accordingly by suffring the ignomi|nious death of the Crosse, he satisfied for man; the righteous dying for the vnrighteous. Bu stay, is he not some English-man that runneth after vs?


Flyer.
I thinke (sir) it is one of the Hy|dutch, that passed in our Shippe. An odde fellow I weene, if so one could

found out his Religion.


Legat. ar.
Lay your Fardle downe, and that shall seeme cause of our staying. But what causeth you to thinke he is of some odde Religion?


Flyer.
For that in some discourse betweene him  another, he seemed to conclude, that the Serpent which tempted Eue, was but some creeping crookednesse of mnde, wynding from God. As also, that Christ and Antichrists, were no reall persons, but fashions of minde.


Legat. ar.
Au, au; I know then what he is: he is a plaine Familist. They teach all their rudiments to their Children, by a familiar kind of Play, which they tearme, The Interlude of Mindes. It was penned by one H. N. an Hy-dutch|man; who also hath left in wryting very many Bookes of that abstruse kind of learning. Some of our late Brownistes are entred into that Familie. I know a Io. L. a Weauer. Weauer in Lndon (he was sometimes a Clothier of Somerset-shire, and after that, first a Brownist, then an Anabaptist, now a Familist,) he will say, that now in one quarter of an

hower whilst he is in his Loome, he can comprehend farre greater Reue|lations of the spirit, then (whilst he was out of that Family) he could in his whole life. But say you nothing, I will seeme ignorant what he is.


Familist.
Sacrament a Godt; how weary I am, in running after you M. Flyer.


Flyer.
I thought it was you, Hans.


Legat. ar.
And you be not out of breath sir, I would we might talke of Religion.


Familist.
Marry best of all; and the spirit of Loue be our direction.


Legat. arr.
What Religion (I pray you) be you of?


Familist.
Seeing you manifest your selues to be religiously affected: and second|ly, seeing we are out of the shot of the Magistrate, I shall freely tell you what I am. I am of the Holy family of Loue; a Family in God, and in whom God is: for God is Loue. And out of this Loue, there is no beeing in life.


Legat. arr.
Au; the Author of your Religion is H. N. or Henrie Nicolaite the Ger|maine.


Familist.
The Characters H. N. be Cha|racters

in the diuine beeing, and not for flesh  blood to attaine to. They be Characters of the Prophet of Loue, as  and  (the Greeke Alpha and Omega) be Characters in the Reuela|tion of the prophet of Grace; or ra|ther, of the Louely-beeing; whom onely the spirit of Wisedome can attaine to.


Legat. ar.
You are all in your Louely-beeinges; specially, when you are all gathered into your Church called Paradis; and there being naked and not ashamed.


Familist.
Floute not Brother, at the Louely|being; nor at the power exhibited of the diuine influence, vnto such as are Deified, and God in them Homini|fied. Such perfection is in the Family of loue, as nothing mooueth in them but Christ, and the anoynted Lou.


Legat. ar.
What make you then of this flesh, or earthly body?


Familist.
That (deare brother) is nothing but the Beastes skinne wherewith God clothed Adam; which is in the end, to turne backe into the mother-earth, the spirit being then clothed with a garment that is from heauen, all beau|tified

with the Louely-beeing.


Flyer.
Surely, this man speaketh deepe matter. It halfe astonisheth mee.


Legat. ar.
Your H. N. hath giuen you a Te|stament, far beyond the Bibles Testa|ment.


Familist.
Flout not Brother; for the Louely-beeing teacheth all loue and meekenes with all simplicitie. Did not Iohn (a man full of the Louely-beeing) did he not in Reuel. 14.6. see an Euerlasting Gopell caryed through the middest of Heauen, to be preached to this last age; for the former Gospell perished by the power of the Beast. The two Prophets (Fayth and Loue) were staine by him, and their carcases onely re|mayned in the streetes of the Harlots Citie: that is, the spirit and life of Fayth and Loue were gone, and only a litle outward profession of them left in the Beastes congregation. Leaue your Scripture-leanednesse, and sub|mit your selfe to the spirit of Lo and you shall not neede to be taught any thing, but as that spirit shall teach you.



Legat. ar.
You are a paltry Heretique, for cal|ling the Bibles fayth, by the name of Scripture-learnednes.


Familist
Deare Brother, rayle not: but sub|mit your selfe to the Louely-beeing.


Legat. arr.
You are a louely-Asse: and there is a louely boxe on the eare for you.


Famalist.
Will you prouoke mee? Will you prouoke mee?


Legat. ar.
Why a sir foole; your opinion of Loue is against fighting.


Famalist.
Doe not prouoke mee brother: for though I am of that opinion, I am yet clothed with the old flesh.


Flyer.
Arrian, take vp there your fardle of Lystes, and be your owne Porter: I perceiue the Diuell raging in thee, and the spirit of Loue in him. And were it not, that the Louely-beeing forbids me, I would coniure the Diuell in you with this Cudgell. Muffe not, speake not; take vp your lowsy-Lystes, and packe about your businesse, or I pro|test by the veritie of my Fayth, I will teach you to abuse the Louely-beeing. No Church? No Christian? Then vaunt Dogge, damn'd of thine owne

conscience.


Familist
Louely Brother, feed your ene|mie, but beat him not. Come Brother, and we will turne vpon the right hand, and so walke togither in peace, according to the instinct of the Loue|ly-beeing. The Port-bell ringes, it is now about the eleuenth hower: The Gates will quickly shut vp for din|ner time: And therefore we will leaue off talke till we come o some Tap|huis, sparing our tongues, and taking more of our legges.


Flyer.
With heart and good will, O reue|rend father of Loue.




THE SIXT DIALOGVE, betweene Flyer and Familist.

Familist
NOw M. Flyer, you are wel|come to my Slaep-huis. I am glad wee be to freed of the proud brabling Arrian. He holdes that the Sonne of God was the beginning of creatures; that is in his sense, the first creature that the Father created; as his companion the Lemu|rist, doth also hold him to be that cre|ated Light, which Moses sayth, was called out of darknesse: and this be|cause S. Iohn doth call the Word, by the tearme Light. All these hereticall conceites do flow, from their literall senses of Scripture, being farre from vnderstanding the hid thinges of the Law. Therevpon also insueth the dis|sentions and fyerie contentions of all

eretiques, euery one maintayning is owne sense, with Fire and Fagot: hereas the spirit of Loue teacheth is people, to be peaceaple with all, nd in all outward ceremonies and eruices, to be plyant to all men and heir lawes; becomming all vnto all, or winning of some: at least for their owne peaceable being, in the seruice of the Loue.


Flyer.
To say the trueth, I can see neither Papist, nor Protestant, Brownist nor other, but they be voyde of that Loue, that should abound towardes all; as Gods loue is towardes all. And that is a plaine signe, that God is not amongst them.


Famalist.
Sure your selfe so. But it will not be amisse Brother now we be a litle coo|led, to drinke a draught of Beere. Tannikin, Tannakin, tap de kan, Tan|nikin. See you (brother) that cherry-cheeked Damsell that tooke vp there the Stoop-kan?


Flyer.
Yes; and a very proper Mayden as I haue seene.


Famalist.
Could you behold her naked, and

not lust?


Flyer.
No man were able to doe that.


Familist.
O, you'r deceiued: There is no one Goddifyed amongst vs, but can behold many of them naked, without any carnall lusting. And were no that perfection heere to he had, then the second Adam should be inferi|our to the first Adam: and so conse|quently, no true recouerie of Aposta|cie, nor entrance into Paradise.


Flyer.
Is it possible, that I should euer come vnto that perfection?


Familist.
Yea, submitting your selfe to the Louely-beeing. You must first walke through the first dayes worke which God createth: then through the se|cond: after through the third, fourth, and fift. Comming afterwardes to the sixt day, you shall become an Adam made in the likenesse of God, and shall behold Euah naked, and ne|uer be ashamed.


Flyer.
This soundeth somewhat which you speake: but I vnderstand it not.


Familist
Come Tannikin; how dost thou Wench: let vs kisse; and tell me how

thy pretty body doth?


Flyer.
Why, how now sir? Are you a man that is Goddifyed, and hanges at a Wenches lippes so wantonly?


Familist.
O sir, she is of the seed of the Louely-beeing. We but Loue, we lust not, as you and others would, that be out of the Louely-beeing.


Flyer.
Louely-beeing call you it? Keepe your Loues  your Lusts to your selfe;  God giue me to see mine owne home againe. There is money for the Beere, and adue leaud leacherous Familist.


Familist.
I pray thee sweete Brother stay, and take knowledge of the Beeing that is in Loue.


Flyer.
That's inough for Tannikin to take knowledge of. For my part, I can nei|ther looke, nor thinke of you, but I shal be truely ashamed: and therefore adue you shamelesse companions. O Lord, pardon my great sinne committed a|gainst thy Church in England: and for thy Sonnes sake, bring mee to be truly reconciled to that Church againe. I returne, I returne; sweete Father of Heauen, keepe me in my returne.

Surely, I can not tell. All the time was there taken vp with the matter  the Tongue, as I had no leasure to suruay the subiect of my Feete. Bu this I am sure, that a man can not passe

there by the by-way, but he shall be as|saulted with one transformed spirit or another. Neuer in my life did I meete with such Heretiques, and deceitfull Hypocrites. Had I not seene,  heard, and felt, I should neuer haue beleeued.


Mediocri.
I am glad, that you haue learned by Experience, what you would ne|uer learne by my tender Informati|on. But I pray you, How stand you now affected for Religion?


Flyer.
Stand quoth yee; I haue been so much acquainted with falling, as I know not well what to say vnto stan|ding. Meeting with an Anabaptist, and vnderstanding the groundes of my Separation; he, by strength of the same groundes, did beat me from that hold, and spite my heart, made me to graunt a separation from Doctrine, so well as from Discipline: so that I was ready, to turne Anabaptist.
Then I met with a Legatine-arrian, (a perilous fellow,) hee vpon the graunt, of no visible-Church for the time of Antichristes raigne, did vna|uoydably conclude, that neither any

visible Church could yet be, till God raysed vp new Apostles, who might with Doctrine and Myracles, gather people to the true Fayth, and so incom|mend vnto them the Sacramentes and other Ordinaunces. To him, ouer|night I consented: but harke what fell out the next day in the morning.
Next day I met with a Familist. Hee by his talke of Loue, Loue, and the beeing in Loue, and nothing but Loue, so preuayled; togither with his run|ning glozing on Scripture, as I left all, to follow him, till I see his beeing in loue and lut, with Tannikin the Tapu~er: which shamefull sight, made mee to bid, Fie on them all. And tur|ning my face homewardes againe, I pluckt vp my feete, to Flushing I came, stayde the winde a while, had shipping readie, and to Grauesend I came in a few howers. God haue the prayse for all his mercies.


Meioc.
Then I hope, that you will returne againe to vnitie with our Church.


Flyer.
If I doe not so, I must turne Turke, for any thing I yet see. I am

omwhat ashamed to returne; First, for hat I should be thought to be vncon|ant: and yet constancie in a Schisme, s but obduration in ill. Secondly, I care to become a ast vnto many, for auing so foolishly consumed my Pa|trimonie: and yet better be flouted at f a few me for a time, then to be per|petually ieaed at of Diuels.


Mediocri.
Brother, brother, be contented to beare your shame, for passed folly. Know, and reuerence your Mother, not withstanding her wantes. Her wantes be of the By, not of the Mayne. She hath the Ioh. 6 68 Word of eternall life then whither will you goe? Antichristia|nisme (as I often told you), consistes not in euery ill; for then euery soule vnder heauen should be Antichristi|an: but it consistes in such an euill as is fundamentally opposite to the Ghospell, that is, to the Doctrine of Fayth. For which cause the Apostle earmeth Antichrist such an Aduersary, as is 2. Thess. 2.4. Antikeimenos, the layer of an opposite foundation. And such a one indeed, were he an Angell from Hea|uen,

is to be helde Gal. 1.6, 7, 8, 9. Anathematized The very Math. 13.24.c. Wheate-fielde it selfe, (Christes possession) hath Tares not onely in it, but also in Communion with the Wheat. Yea, in so strict com|munion with the Children of the Kingdome, as such euil-ones cannot be excommunicate with the good of the Church; and therefore permitted to grow, till GOD weed them out. The Tare is not euery euill, for then euery euill should grow, and the Churches censures were idle: but they be such euil-ones, as can be no more remooued with the Churches good, then Tares from Wheate, with which it first groweth vp hypocriti|cally as Wheate: but in time, disclo|seth it selfe for a close winder about, not an vpright grower.
Wantes are to be lamented, and the good not fled from: much lesse condemned for no Wheate, because it standes in some communion with Tares. Other Weedes that grow loose from the Wheate, are timelily to be remooued; and yet if the Husband|man

sometimes neglect that dutie, God forbid, that we should therevp|pon conclude, that all the Wheate is no more Wheate; and so no visible Christian in the Lordes possession.
Nor do the Holy thinges of God, cease to be Holy, because they be sometimes conueyde to euil-ones, so well as to them be good, (euen as the Raine is the same, which God sendeth vpon the Wheate and Tare, Hearbe and Weede:) but the Holy thinges prophaned, become 1. Cor. 11.29. c. Iudgement to the prophaners, and yet cease not to be Holy (be it Word or Sacrament) to the Reuerend receiuers.
O brother, the Sacrifices were seasoned with Salt, before they fla|med on the Alter: and so should our Soules be seasoned with Discretion, before they flamed in our Churches. Some haue Knowledge,  no Zeale; a cold house must-there be kept: and some haue much Zeale,  small Skill; no maruaile if he set the house on fire.
No man (sayth the Apostle) 2. Tim. 2.5 stri|uing for a maisterie, is crowned, ex|cept

he striue as he ought. This is farre from beeing as it ought.
1 To call our Mother (the Church) an Whore, because she hath some wantes; or in somewhat crosseth our humour.
2 To spit in her face, and to runne away from her, so soone as we thinke we can shift for our selues.
3 To goe and band our selues with other Ml-contents, for murdring our Mother, as hauing no life of God in her.
4 Yea, to proclaime all her Chil|dren Bastardes. For if she were neuer a true Church, neuer maried to Christ; then could she neuer bring foorth a lawfull, but a bastardly-seed. And so, all our holy Martyrs (dying in, and for the same Fayth) should also with vs, be Aliens from the life of Christ Ie|sus. Fearefull actions,  blaspemous conclusions. But better it can not be with such as withdraw vnto perdi|tion. O my soule! haue no pleasure in them.


Flyer.
Sweete Mediocritie, I now see the

soundnes of al these conclusions, which before Experience, I but held as pleas for corruption. God lay not that sinne to my charge; and he, for his Sonnes sake, reduce other wandring soules, to peaceable vnitie with our Church; that so we may be as one flocke, vnder that one great Archbishoppe of our soules, Christ Iesus. Amen.


Mediocri.
Amen. Now we be come to the Citie; and it is hy-time for him to eate, that did not eate any thing to day. I would pray you to walke home with me,  to take part thank|fully, of such as God shall send for the present.


Flyer.
I thanke you sir. Hauing gotten the Citie againe on my backe, methinks I am as the Prodigall, that hauing left a company of filthy Swine behinde him, hath got his Fathers house on his bead, where he may feed comfortably, and sleepe safely.





CERTAINE POSITI|ONS, NECESSARILY to be held, for auoyding errour: first, touching the Church; secondly, Antichrist.
Touching the Church.
1 THE Church of God, had a visible beeing vpon Earth, from Adam vnto Christ, or else S.Luke. 3.23. c. Lukes draught of the Genealogie, were to small or no pur|pose.
2 The Church of God, from Christes time hitherto hath,Math. 16.18.  ch. 28.20. Reu. 12 17.  ch. 21.2-3 Gal, 4.26. and to the worlds end shall hae, as true a visibi|litie as the former; Christ hauing no lesse care ouer his Church in her Ful-age, then he had before in her Non-age.
3 But as the Church of the olde Testament, was not alwayes alike vi|sible: so neither this of the new Te|stament.
4 For as the Church is compared to the Moone; so in the Moone we see much change; inowe more, and inowe lesse seeable and lesse glorious. And howsoeuer sometimes she be quite latent and hid to some part of the Earth, yet to some otherpart of the Earth, she is euer patent and visi|ble. And euen so it is with the Church in this life.
5 And as she is compared to a
Math. 13. 24. See for this, my Antidoton.Wheat-field, in the middest where|of some enemie doth secretly sowe Tares: So, she consisting of the Chil|dren of the Kingdome, shall haue to her griefe, Children of the wicked, in midst of her bosome. Howsoeuer at the first plantation by the Apostles through all Natins, she was excel|lently visible; yet afterwardes her Field is ouergrowne with euill, to the vexation of waking Ministers: And so she is to continue with grieuance

of spirit, till the great Haruest time, that there can be a seperation made, without violence vo her body.
6 As she was represented by
1 Cor. 3 16.  2. Cor. 6.16. Salomons Temple, which is inowe all beauteous and rich; Inow robbed and spoyled, anone consumed to the Earth; but afterwardes (as Ezekiel saw) raysed vp with greater glory: Euen so, the Church in her beginning was glorious; by Kinkes bringing their Crownes to it, she became Rich. Afterwards, sacrilegious persons flee|ced her of her Plate, carrying it into the house of their God Belly, not Bell. And in the end, she shall be layde flat with the Earth, and passe as refyned through Fire. But an happy Resur|rectio~ shalbe made, to the augmenta|tion of her glory-eternall. And that, and no other is her Re-plantation.
7 Idolatrie set vp in the Hy-pla|ces of Israel, from the time of their
1. King. 12. 18.Schisme from Iudah, till their depor|tation, it neuer caused a Nullitie of the Church, howsoeuer a Diminution. And therefore it was, that the Lord not

onely called Israel his people, but also, raysed vp As Elias. Elia, Ho|seih, Amos, Ionah, with others.Prophets vnto them con|tinually; hauing also amongst them, whole schooles of Prophets, and Pro|phets children, euen in the corruptest times. The same may be sayd of Iu|dah, when Idols were reared vp in the Temple. The like also may be re|membred of Israel in Aegipt, Ezek. 20. 5. c. The reason is rendred: some|times for the sakes of a few, he spareth many. Sometimes againe, he will not take the aduantage against her, for his owne names sake.
8 Sometimes the Church restes in orderly constitution, as in Iude: sometimes shaken out of order, as was the Apostolicall Church at Ieru|salem; and caryed away captiue, as the Iewes were for seauentie yeares. And yet, whether in Constitution or out of Constitution, ordred or disor|dred, she was truey visible; Secundum Maius  Minus. A lesse priuiledge, the Church of the New Testament, cannot haue.
9 That Commaundement in

Math. 18. Tell the Church, is an affirma|tiue iniunction, as is that, Three times a yeare euery male shall come to Ierusalem. As these three times a yeare could not be obserued, when they were in Cap|tiuitie: so neither the Church could be told, but when she was vnscatte|red, and in some tollerable constitu|tion. Commaundements Affirmatiue do not alwayes binde; but Negatiues doe. No euill forbidden, may be done at any time; but many Affirmatiues enioyned, may sometimes be lawfully vndone, because the occasion or meanes of doing them, is lacking. The Romanistes therefore presse that Dic Ecclesiae to no purpose.
10 The Church so alwayes, ha|uing some visible face, it must ineui|tably follow, that Hel-gates neuer preuayled against her. And so by consequent, that that doctrine of Fayth in Christ which Peter peached in Math. 16. it neuer fayled in the Church, but of some of her members, haue been held and preached truely and effectually; and so, that is, the





In Reuel. 14.6. it would be turned,
The euerla|sting Ghos|pel; rather then, An euelasting Ghspel.Euerlasting Ghospell spoken of in the Reuelation, which in the last times (maugre the Beast) is preached as farre as the Heauens extend.

Touching Antichrist and Antichristianisme.
1 ANtichrist, implyeth either one that is opposite vnto Christ; or one that taketh falsely vpon him, the place of Christ. If he take vpon him the place of Christ, it is (as the counter|faite Lambe in Reu. 13.) to dispense saluation by a contrary meanes; as is the doctrine of Iustification (before God) by Workes; the Ghospell saying the contrary, Gal. 2.16. Not by Workes, but by Fayth.
2 As he is opposite vnto Christ, so specially (and in Scripture-sense, in a manner, onely) for that he tea|cheth a contrary Ghospell; that is, A glad tydinges contrary to that of

Christ: and so it comes to the former, according to his title Antikemenos, obserued from the 2. Thess. 2.4. giuen also in 1. Cor. 16.9. to such as opposed to the foundation of Fayth, preached by the Apostle. Sottish therefore be such Schismatiques, as haue taught, that euery euill is Antichristianisme. They may as well say, that euery one of Gods Children hath Antichristia|nisme in him; and in sinning whatso|euer sinne, he is an Antichrist. And as foolish haue they been, who con|clude all (vnder any Apostaticall
Pope) to be damned as lymmes of An|tichrist, when as vnder the most cor|rupt regiment, many (howsoeuer ig|norantly stayned with sundry euils) haue held the Ghospels 1. Cor. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.foundation, euen the doctrine of Iustification, most truely and soundly: Sed vno mlo concesso, sequuntur Infinita.
3 Antichristianisme so properly vnderstood, is a matter of Doctrine, not of Discipline: a matter of Fayth, not of externall Policie. And not of
any Doctrine, or any Fayth: but a

Doctrine opposite to that Fayth which is to be had in Christ Ies onely, for perfect iustification. An that aduerse Doctrine, is as that stin of the Locust-scorpion in Reuel. 9 which exceedingly payneth the seduced soule, bringing it to plaine desperation. For howsoeuer the doctrin of Iustification by Workes, doth look amiably at the first blush; yet whe that soule shall lay her Workes to th ballance of the Law, it shalbe so farr from finding comfort in it, as it shal dispaire,  seeke by vntimely death to strangle the Remembrance of it.
4 The Antichrist, or Antikeimenis considered then as one Man, is th whole corporation of such people, a teach an opposite ground, to the ground of the Gospell; wherevpon vnhappily, they may build much o|ther euill: but all that is of the By, no of the Mayne; and yet condemnable also: With which By, or euill acci|dentes, the truest Church and Chri|stian, in this life, hath, is, and shalbe more or lesse cumbred; and yet no

erefore Antichristian, seeing she and ey be sound in the foundation of e Gospell. For the Foundation eld, there may be Straw, and other ooleries (through ignoraunce or eaknes) buylded vpon it, othing utable to the ground, and yet the uilder saued, though (as the Apo|stle teacheth) 1. Cor. 3.15.it be as by the Fyre. But a contrary foundation layd and held till the end, it auayleth nothing what Golde and Siluer was builded vpon it; for the foundation sinketh, and man and all (standing vpon it) perisheth.
5 This 2. Thess. 2. 3. Man of sinne then, must be considered, not onely in the whole, as one Corporation; but also in the partes or members, which concurre to the beeing of that Body: and both of them according to their Place or situation. The principall members of that body, are registred of S. lon in his Apocalips, to haue the Seauen hilled Citie (Rome) for their place. The members in subordination to the for|mer, are of him compared to Waters,

for their multitude  variable noy of language, because that Rome w to haue, people of many Language subiect to the Doctrine, that shoul flow from that Sea. What soule the soeuer (whether in the Church of Eng|land, or other true Church) shall sub|mit it selfe to Antikeimenisme, it long|eth to the Romish-head. And whatso|euer soule, within the territories of
Rome, shall submit it selfe to the con|trary foundation which is in Christ Iesus, such a one appertaineth to that body, whereof Christ is the head: and indeed, is a fellow member with vs. For euery one that walketh, ea|teth, and sleepeth in a Kinges Court, is not therefore of that Court: no euery one that dwelleth, and hath or|dinarie communion with a King|dome, is therefore one with that King in the foundation of subiection. None therefore, can iusifie all within a true vsible Church, nor condemne all that be within the Beastes visible King|dome; seeing all Within it, are not es|sencially Of it. Beeing one in the

foundatio~, one is so Essencially of it: but f seuered in the fundamentall poynt of obedience, then such a one is but a member Accidentaly. And Accidents, specially proceeding of weaknesse, may burne and be consumed, without detriment to the foundation, or him that in humility resteth vpon it.
6 Which ground held, the Roma|nist is easily answered: Hee asketh Where our Church was 200. yeares since? I answere; As there might be some part of the Church, in some part of the earth, though to vs vnknowen, euen as wee are vnknowen to some partes of the earth: so, our Church hath been where their Synagogue hath been, and many of the members of it, still persecuted by them. Besides, they were to come into the Church,2. Thess 2.4 as Tares came into the Wheat-field, by way of vsurpation, not right. And this the Apostle foretolde, when he sayth, that the Antikeimenist should sit in the Temple of God. God reared a spirituall Temple at Rome, (as appea|reth in the Apostles Epistle to that

Church) but afterwardes, the Man o sinne entred into the Lords House, and there not only laboured, to ouerturne the foundation laid in Christs-blood, but also layd a contrary ground as fast, as he could pull vp the other. Vpon which, that Church became for constitution, like vnto the ten Tribes of Isral, when their Calues were rea|red vp: Which Calfe since, in the time of the Romanistes, is turned to a Bull; howsoeuer we (with Iudah) can|not meet with the Popes Bull, but we baite him. The veritie of all this will better appeare, when hauing read the Epistle to the Romanes, it shalbe exa|mined, whether wee or they, be fur|thest departed from the veritie of that Doctrine, which that Church first held: And then I am sure, that their part of the Cake, is like to prooue dough: Amen. But as for the Roma|nist, he fals into the errour of the left hand: and that kind of errour, may come to be touched in his season.
Thus briefly, touching the Church, and that her aduersary, Anti-christ




THE SHEPHEARDS Elegiaque Epilogue.
YOu Shepheards of our Lawnes, leaue off your layes,
Alacke (for woe) these be no ioying dayes.
While many of our Sheepe do peake aside,
Staring for Daintrels, in their height of pride,
(O welladay) then prowling Reinard teares,
And learing Wolues do take them by the eares;
And from their iowles do squeaze the crimsen die
Where-with life endes. Accurst Phlebotmie.
Or if you needes must strayne an Oten-pipe,
O let' be greene, so shall it cry and shrike;
And bubble foorth some iucy fainting teares,
Which may procure some mones of all it heares.
A neede of Iakobs Staffe (if e're) to beat
Backe these blood-suckers, which make Lambes their mea
Poore Lambes their meat, alacke and welladay;
Wring hand in hand, in roume of Roundelay.
Aminta' Crowne (f she was worth a Crowne)
Her Head I found (last day) aback the Downe.
There litle Lucrece with her specked powle,
Was fleest of all her Wooll, poore pretty sowle:
But as she ready was to gasp last breath,
I came (goodha) and rescued her from death
Black VVill that time was joorring of the Fox,
And so escapt, with losse alone of locks.
Great Megge was tangled in a cursed Bryer,
Bald-paed all, like to an holy Frier,
That lately had been in the Pollers hands:
I troe (she will no more come in these bands.
But ayes me man, aback the Poplar tree,
Where Shepheards eate their shaled Pease with glee,
And in the Trench (about that Table square,
Compact of Dazy soddes, but now all bare)
There, there (woes mee) three Tups haue left their lyues,
With sundry seores of their poore Lambs and Wyues.
Heere lyes a lock, and there a scrap of skin,
The botthom of the Trench, the bloods lyes in:
And then (vile sacriledge) the vpper seat
Where Vmpire of the Shepheards sits at meat:
There, there the Wolues haue trampeled and trod,
And cast their Gorge vpon the Royall sodde.
Yee Shepheards of our Lawnes, it resteth, All
Ioyne heart and hand, for keeping of our Stall.
Wee negligent haue been (indeed) too long,
While cruell Cattle are become too strong.
Wee sing of matters farre beyond the Sun,
While all this mischiefe, heere at home is don.
I feare, I feare, that some in Shepheards pay,
Be one in night with Wolues, with vs  the day.
Iwis, our Maister can but take it euell,
His Sheepe through lacke of food, run to the Deuell.
Not euery Sonet is for selfe-same turne,
(For some cuse ioy, and some enforce to moorne)
Strow, strow that fodder, fore your Charges faces.
Which may them keepe, from foraigne vncouh places.
And with your eye so lead them in the way,
As (sylly-soules) they may no longer stray.
They may no longer stray, but able bee,
Through all their flattring stratagems to see.
Meane time I moorne, I moorne Maryahs stray,
Returne that Sheepe  Lord;  Lord I pray.
Returne I humbly pray, Returne them all,
That truly long vnto our Maisters stall.
FINIS.
