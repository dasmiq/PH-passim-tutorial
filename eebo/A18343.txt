This first chapiter of the first tractate sheweth vnder what kynge the play of the chesse was founden and maad.:.
AMonge all the euyll condicions and signes that may be in a man the first and y^e grettest is whan he feereth not / ne dredeth to displese and make wroth god by synne / and the peple by lyuyng disordynatly / whan he rec|cheth not / ner taketh hede vnto them that repreue hym and his vices / but sleeth them / In suche wyse as dide the emperour Nero / whiche dide do slee his maister seneque For as moche as he mig  suffre to be repreuid and taught of hym In lyke wyse was somtyme a kynge in babilome that was named Emsmerodac a Iolye man with oute Iustice and so cruell that he dyde do hewe his faders body in thre honderd pieces / And gaf hit to ete and deuour to thre honderd birdes that men calle voultres And was of suche condicion as was Nero / And right well resemblid and was lyke vnto his fader Nabogo|donosor / whiche on a tyme wold do slee alle the sage and wyse men of babylonye / For as moche as they coude not telle hym his dreme that he had dremed on a nyght and had forgoten hit lyke as it is wreton in the bible in the book of danyell / Vnder this kynge than Emlmerodach was this game and playe of the chesse founden / Trewe it is that some men wene / that this playe was founden in the tyme of the bataylles  siege of troye But that is not soo For this playe-cam to the playes of the caldees as dyomedes the greek sayth and reherceth. That amonge the philosophrs was the most renomed playe amonge all other playes / And after that / cain this

playe in the tyme of Alixandre the grete in to Egipte And so vnto alle the parties toward the south / And the cause wherfore thys playe was so renomed shall be sayd in the thirde chapitre.


This seconde chapitre of the first tractate sheweth who fonde first the playe of the chesse.
THys playe fonde a phylosopher of Thoryent whiche was named in Caldee Exerses or in greke philometor / whiche is as moche to saye in english as he that loueth Iustice and mesure / And this philosopher was renod gretly amonge the gre|kes, and them of Athenes whiche were good clerkys and philosophers also renomed of theyr comiynge This philosopher was so Iuste and trewe that he had leuyr dye than to lyue longe and be a fal flaterer wyth the sayd kynge For whan he behelde the foull and synfull lyf of the kynge / And that no man durst blame hym. For by his grete cruelte he putte them alle to deth that displesid hym / he put hym self in paryll of deth / And louyd and chees rather to dye than longer to lyue: The euyll lyf and diffamed of a kynge is the lyf of a cruell beste / And ought not longe to be susteyned / For he destroyeth hym that displesith hym / And therfore re|herceth valeriuds / that ther was a wise man named the|odore cerem whom his kynge dyde do hange on the crosse for as moche as he repreuyd hym of his euyll fowll lyf And all way as he was in the torment he said to y^e kynge / vpon thy counceyllours  them that ben cladd in thy clothynge  robes were more reson that this torment shold come / For as moche as they dar not saye to the

The trouthe for to do Iustice right wysly / of my self I make no force whether I dye on the lande or on the wa|ter or otherwyse  as who sayth he recched not to dye for Iustice / In lyke wyse as democreon the philosophre put out his owen eyen be cause he wold not see that no good myght come to the euyll and vicyous peple wyth out right And also defortes the philosophre as he went toward his deth / his wyf that folowed after hym saide that he was dampned to deth wrongfully / than he ans|werd and sayd to her / holde thy peas and be styll / hit is better and more merytorye to dye by a wronge and vn|rightfull Iugement / than that I had deseruyd to dye.


The thirde chapitre of the irst tractate treteth wher|fore the playe was founden and maad.
THe causes wherfore this playe was founden ben thre / the first was for to correcte and repreue the kynge For whan this kynge Emmerodach sawe this playe And the barons knyghtes and gentill|men of his court playe wyth the philosopher / he merua|ylled gretly of the beaulte and nouelte of the playe / And desired to playe agaynst y^e philosopher / The philosopher answerd and sayd to hym that hit myght not be doon. But yf he first lerned the playe / The kynge said hit was reson and that he wold put hym to the payne to lerne hit Than the philosophre began to teche hym and to shewe hym the maner of the table of the chesse borde and the chesse meyne / And also the maners and condicions of a kynge of the nobles and of the comun peple and of theyr offices and how they shold be touchid and drawen. And how he shold amende hym self  become vertuous And whan this kynge herde that he repreuyd hym / He

demanded hym vpon payne of deth to telle hym wher|fore he had founden and made this playe / And he ans|werd my ryght dere lord and kynge / the grettest and most thinge that I desire is that thou haue in thy self a glo+ryous and vertuous lyf And that may I not see / but yf thou be endoctrined and well manerd and that had / so mayst thou be belouyd of thy peple Thus than I desire y^t thou haue other gouernement than thou hast had / And that thou haue vpon thy self first seygnorye and maistrye suche as thou hast vpon other by force and not by right Certaynly hit is not ryght that a man be mayster ouer other and comandour / whan he can not rewle ner may rewle hym self and that his vertues domyne aboue his vices / For seygnourye by force and wylle may not longe endure / Than thus may thou see oon of the causes why and wherfore I haue founden and maad thys playe / whyche Is for to correcte and repente the of thy tyranye and vicyous lyuynge / For alle kynges specy|ally ought to here her corrygeours or correctours and her corrections to hold and kepe in mynde / In lyke wyse as Valerius reherceth that the kynge Alixandre had a noble and renomed knyght that sayd in repreuynge of Alixandre that he was to moche couetous and in especyall of the honours of the world / And sayd to hym yf the goddes had maad thy body as greet as is thy herte Alle the world coude not holde the / For thou holdest in thy right hand alle the Oryent / And in thy lyfte hande the occident / syn than hit is so / or thou art a god or a man or nought / yf thou be god / doo than well and good to the peple as god doth / And take not from them that they ought to haue and is theyres.

yf thou be a man / thinke that thou shalt dye / And than thou shalt doo noon euyll / yf thou be nought forgete thy self / ther is no thynge so stronge and ferme / but that somtyme a feble thinge casteth doun and ouerthrowe hit How well that the lyon be the strengest beste / yet som|tyme a lityll birde eteth hym / The seconde cause wherfore this playe was founden and maad / was for to kepe hym from ydlenesse / wherof senecque saith vnto lucylle ydlenes wyth oute ony ocupacion is sepulture of a man lyuyng / and varro saith in his sentences that in lyke wise as men goo not for to goo / the same wyse the lyf is not gyuen for to lyue but for to doo well and good / And therfore secondly the philosopher fonde this playe for to kepe the peple from ydlenes / For ther is moche peple. Whan so is that they be fortunat in wordly goodes that they drawe them to ease and ydlenes wherof cometh ofte tymes many euyllys and grete synnes And by this ydlenes the herte is quenchid wherof cometh despera|cion / The thirde cause is that euery man naturelly desireth to knowe and to here noueltees and tydynges / For this cause they of atthenes studyed as we rede / and for as the corporall or bodyly sight enpessheth and letteth other|whyle the knowleche of subtyll thinges / therfore we rede that democrion the phylosopher put oute his owen eyen / for as moche as he myght haue the better entende|ment and vnderstondynge / Many haue ben made blynde that were grete clerkis in lyke wyse as was dydymus bisshop of Alixandrye / that how well that he sawe not yet he was so grete a clerk / that gregore nazan  saynt Ierome that were clerkes and maystres to other / came for to be his scolers  lerned of hym And saint Anthonie

The grete heremyte cam for to see hym on a tyme / and amonge all other thynges / he demanded hym yf he were not gretly displesid that he was blynde and sawe not. And he answerd that he was gretly abasshid / for that he supposid not that he was not displesid in that he had lost his sight / And saynt Anthonye answerd to hym I meruayle moche that hit displesith the that thou hast lost that thynge whiche is comyn betwene the and bestes. And thou knowest well that thou hast not loste that thynge that is comyn bitwene the and the angellis And for thise causes forsayd the philosopher entended to put away alle pensifnes and thoughtes / and to thynke only on this playe as shall be said  appere in this book after.




The seconde tractate / the first chapiter treteth of the forme of a kynge of his maners and of his estate.
THe kynge must be thus maad For he must sitte in a chayer clothed in purpure / crowned on his heed in his ryght hand a ceptre and in the lyfte hande an apple of gold / For he is the most grettest and hyest in dignyte aboue alle other and most worthy. And that is signefyed by the corone / For the glorye of the peple is the dignite of the kynge / And aboue all other the kynge ought to be replenysshid with vertues and of grace / and thys signefieth the purpure For in lyke wyse as the robes of purpure maketh fayr  enbe|lysshith the body / the same wise vertues maketh the sowle / he ought alleway thenke on the gouernement of the Royame and who hath thadmynystracion of Iustice / And thys shuld be by hym self pryncipally.

This signefieth the app~ell of gold that he holdeth in his lyfte honde / And for as moche as hit apperteyneth vnto hym to punysshe the rebelles hath he y^e sceptre in his right hand And for as moche as mysericorde and trouthe con|serue and kepe the kynge in his trone / Therfore ought a kynge to be mercyfull and debonayr For whan a kynge or prynce desired or will be belouyd of his peple late hym be gouerned by debonarite And valerius saith that debo+nairte percyth the hertes of straungers and amolisshith and maketh softe the hertes of his enemyes / wherof he reherceth that philostratus that was duc of athenes had a doughter / whom a man louyd so ardantly / that on a tyme as he sawe her wyth her moder / sodaynly he cam and kyssed her / wherof the moder was so angry and soroufull that she wente and requyred of her lord the duc / that his heed myght be smyten of / The prynce ans|werd to her and sayde / yf we shold slee them that loue vs / what shall we doo to our enemyes that hate vs / Cer|taynly this was thanswer of a noble  debonair prynce That suffred that villonye don to his doughter and to hym self yet more This prince had also a frende that was named Arispe that sayd on a tyme as moche villonye vnto the prynce as ony man miht saye And that might not suffise hym / but he scracchid hym in the visage / The prynce suffryd hym paciently in suche wyse as thowh he had doon to hym no vilonye but curtoysye And whan his sones wold haue auengid this vilonye / he comanded them that they shold not be so hardy so to do The next day folowyng arispe remembrid of the right grete vilonye that he had don to his frende and lord wyth oute cause. He fyll in dispayr and wold haue slayn hym self / whan

the duc knewe and vnderstode that / he cam to hym and sayd / ne doubte the nothynge And swore to hym by his fayth / that also well he was and shold be his frende fro than forthon as euery he had ben to fore yf he wold And thus he respited hym of his deth by his debonairte. And in lyke wyse rede we of the kynge pirre to whom was reported that they of tarente had said grete vilonye of hym For whiche cause he maad alle them to come to fore hym And demanded of them yf they had so sayd. Than oon of them answerd and sayd / yf the wyn and the candellys had not fayllyd / thys langage had ben but a Iape / In regarde of that we had thought to haue doon / Than the kynge began to lawhe / for they had con|fessid that suche langage as was sayd and spoken was by dronkenship / And for this cause of debonairte the peple of tarante toke for a custome that the dronken men shold be punysshyd / And the sobre men preysed. The kynge than thus ought to loue humylyte and hate falte after the holy scripture that speketh of euery man generally / For the kynge in his royame representeth god / And god is verite / And therfore hym ought to saye no thynge but yf hit were veritable and stable. Valerius reherceth that Alixandre wyth alle his ooste rood for to destroye a cyte whyche was named lap|sare / whan than a phylosophre whiche had to name Anaximenes whiche had ben to fore maistre  gouer|nour of Alixandre herd and vnderstood of his comyng Cam agayn Alixandre for to desire and requyre of hym. And whan he sawe Alixandre he supposid to haue axid his requeste / Alixander brake his demande to fore and swore to hym to fore he axid ony thynge by his goddes.

That suche thynge as he axid or requyryd of hym / he wold in no wyse doon / Than the philosopher requyred hym to destroye the cyte / whan Alixandre vnderstood his desire / and the oth that he had maad / he suffrid the cyte to stande and not to be destroyed For he had leuer doo his wyll than to be periured and forsworn and doo aga|ynst his oth / Quyntilian saith that no grete man ne lord shold not swere / but where as is grete nede / And that the symple parole or worde of a prynce ought to be more stable than the oth of a marchau~t / Alas how kepe the prynces their promisses in thise dayes / not only her pro|mises but their othes her sealis and wrytynges  signes of their propre handes / alle faylleth god amende hit  A kynge also ought to hate alle cruelte / For we rede that neuer yet dyed ony pietous persone of euyll deth ne cruell persone of good deth Therfore recounteth valerius that ther was a man named theryle a werkeman in me|tall / that made a boole of coppre and a lityll wyket on the side / wherby men myght put in them that shuld be brent therin / And hit was maad in suche manere / that they that shold be put and enclosid therin shold crye no thinge lyke to the wys of a man but of an oxe And this made he be cause men shold haue the lasse pite of them. Whan he had made this bole of copper / he presented hit vnto a kynge whiche was callyd philarde that was so cruell a tyrant that he delited in no thinge but in cruelte And he told hym the condicion of the bole / whan philarde herde and vnderstode this / he alowed and preysed moche the werke / And after sayde to hym / thou that art more cruell than I am / thou shalt assaye  proue first thy p~sente and yeft / And so made hym to goo in to the boole and

dye an euyll deth / Therfore saith Ouide ther is no thinge more raisonable than that a man dye of suche deth as he purchaseth vnto other Also the kynge ought souerainly kepe Iustice / who maketh or kepeth a royame with oute Iustice / of verray force ther muste be grete robberye and thefte Therfor reherceth saint Augustyn in a book which is intituled the cyte of god / that ther was a theef of the see named diomedes that was a grete rouar and dide so moche harme that the complaintes cam to fore Alixander whiche dide hym to be taken  brought to fore hym / and he demanded hym wherfore he was so noyous  cruell in the see And he answerd to hym agayn / for as moche as thou art on a lande in the world / so am I another in y^e see but for as moche as the euyll y^t I doo is in oon galeye or tweyne therfore I am callyd a theef / but for as moche as thou dst in many shippis and with grete puyssance and power therfore art thou callyd an emperour / but yf fortune were for me in suche wyse / I wold be come a good man and better than I now am / but thou / the more richer and fortunat that thou art / the more worse art thou / Alixander sayd to hym I shall change thy fortune in suche wyse as thou ne saye / that thou shalt doo hit by pouerte / but for euyll and mauaiste / And so he made hym ryche / And thys was he that afterward was a good prynce and a good Iusticyer / The kynge ought to be soueraynly chaste / And this signefyeth a quene that is only on his ryght syde For hit is to be beleuyd and cre|dible that whan the kynge is a good man Iuste. trewe  of good maners and condicions / that his children shall folowe gladly the same / for a good sone  a trewe ought not to forsake  goo fro y^e good condicions of his fader.

For certes hit is agaynst god and nature in partie whan a man taketh other than his propre wyf / And that see we by birdes / of whom the male and female haue to gy|der the charge in kepynge and norisshinge of their yonge fowlis and birdis / For some maner of fowlis kepen them to theyr femeles only / As hit appereth by storkes dowues and turtils / But tho fowles that norisshith not their birdes haue many wyues and femelles / As the cock that no thynge norisshith his chekens / And therfore amonge alle the bestes that been / Man and woman putteth most theyr ente and haue moste cure  charge in norisshyng of their children / And therfore doon they agaynst nature in partye whan they leue theyr wyues for other women / Of this chastete reherceth valerius an ex|ample and saith that ther was a man of rome which was named scipio affrican For as moche as he had con+querd affricque how well that he was of rome born. Whan he was of .xxxiiii. yer of age he conquerd cartage And toke moche peple in Ostage / Amonge whom he was presented wyth a right fair mayde for his solas and playsir whiche was assurid and handfast vnto a noble yong gentillman of cartage whiche was named Indimcible / And anon as this gentill scipio knewe that Notwythstandyng that he was a prynce noble  lusty Dyde do calle anon the parents and kynnesmen of them And deliuerid to them their doughter wyth oute doyng of ony vilonye to her / and y^e raenso or gold that they had ordeyned for their doughter / gaf hi euery dele In do waire to her And the yong man that was her husbonde sawe the fraunchis nd gentilnes of hym / torned hym self and the hertes of the noble peple vnto the loue  alliance

of the romayns / And this suffiseth as towchynge the kynge .


The seconde chapit of the seconde book treteth of the forme and maners of the Quene.
THus ought the Quene be maad / she ought to be a fair lady sittynge in a chayer and crowned wyth a corone on her heed and cladd wyth a cloth of gold  a mantyll aboue furrid wyth ermynes And she shold sytte on the lyfte syde of the kinge for the amplections and enbrasynge of her husbonde / lyke as it is sayd in scripture in the canticles / her lyfte arme shall be vnder my heed And her ryght arme shall be clyppe and enbrace me / In that she is sette on his lyfte syde is by grace gyuen to the kynge by nature and of ryght. For better is to haue a kynge by succession than by elec|cion / For oftentymes the electours and chosers can not ne wyll not accorde / And so is the election left / And otherwhyle they chese not the beste and most able and conuenyent / but hym that they best loue / or is for them most proffytable / But whan the kynge is by lignage and by trewe succession / he is taught enseygned and nourisshid in his yongth in alle good  vertuous tacches and maners of hys fader / And also the prynces of the royame dar not so hardily meue warre agaynst a kynge hauynge a sone for to regne after hym And so a Quene ought to be chaste. wyse. of honest peple / well manerd and not curyous in nourisshynge of her children / her wysedom ought not only tappere in feet and werkes but also in spekynge that is to wete that she be secrete and telle not suche thynges as ought to be holden se|crete / Wherfore it is a comyn prouerbe 

that women can kepe no counceyle And acordyng therto Macrobe reherceth in the book of the dremes of scipio. That ther was a child of rome that was named papi|rus that on a tyme went with his fader whiche was a senatour in to the chambre where as they helde their coun+ceyll And that tyme they spak of suche maters as was comanded and agreed shold be kept secrete vpon payn of their heedes And so departed And whan he was comen home from the senatoire and fro the counceyll with his fader / his moder demanded of hym what was the coun|ceyll and wherof they spack and had taryed so longe there And the childe answerd to her and sayd he durst not telle ner saye hit for so moche as hit was defended vpon payn of deth Than was the moder more desirous to knowe than she was to fore / And began to flatere hym one tyme And afterward to menace hym that he shold saye and telle to her what hit was And whan the childe sawe that he might haue no reste of his moder in no wise He made her first promise that she shold kepe hit secrete And to telle hit to none of the world / And that doon he fayned a lesing or a lye and sayd to her / that the sena|tours had in counceyll a grete question and difference whiche was this / whether hit were better and more for the comyn wele of rome / that a man shold haue two wyuys / or a wyf to haue two husbondes / And whan she had vnderstonde this / he defended her that she shold telle hit to none other body And after this she wente to her gossyb and told to her this counceyll secretly / And she told to an other / And thus euery wyf tolde hit to other in secrete And thus hit happend anone after that alle the wyues of rome cam to the senatorye where the

senatours were assemblid / And cryed wyth an hye wys / that they had leuer / and also hit were better for the comyn wele that a wyf shold haue two husbondes than a man two wyues / The senatours heerynge this. were gretly abasshid and wist not what to saye / ner how to answere / tyll at laste that the child papire reher|ced to them all the caas and feet how hit was happend And whan the senatours herd vnderstood the mater they were gretly abasshid / and comended gretly y^e Iuge|nye  wytte of the child that so wisely contriued the lye rather than he wolde discouere their cou~ceyll / And forth|with made hym a senatour / and establisshid ordeyned fro than forthon that no childe in ony wise sholl entre in to y^e counceyll hous amonge them with their faders exept papirus / whome they wold y^t he shold al~wey be among them / also a quene ought to be chaste / for as she is aboue all other in astate  reuerce so shold she be ensample to all other in her liuyng honestly / wherof Ierome reherceth agaynst Ioynyan / that ther was a gentilman of rome named duele / and this man was he y^t first fond y^e maner to fight on y^e water / and had first victorie / this duele had to his wif one of the best women  so chaste / that euery woman might take ensample of her / And at y^t tyme the synne of the flesshe was the grettest synne y^t ony might doo agaynst nature / And this sayd good woman was named ylye / and so hit happend that this duele becam so olde that he stowped quaqued for age And on a tym one of his aduersaries repreuyd reprochid hym sayng that he had a stynkynge breth / And forthwyth he wente home to his wyf alle angry and abasshid and axid her why and wherfore she had not told his defaulte

to hym that he myght haue founden remedye to haue ben purgid therof / And she answerd that as for as moche as she supposid that euery man had that same faute as well as he For she kyst neuer ony mannes mouth but her husbondes / O moche was this woman to be prey|sed  haue a singuler lawde wenynge that this defaulte had not ben only in her husbonde / wherfore she suffrid hit paciently in suche wyse that her husbonde knewe his defaute sonner by other than by her / Also we rede that ther was a wedowe named anna / whiche had a frende that counceyllid her to marye / For she was yong fayr and riche / to whom she answerd that she wold not so doo in no wise For yf I shold haue an husbond as I haue had and that he were as good as he was / I shold euer ben a ferd to lose hym / lyke as I lost that other / And than shold I lyue allwey in fere  drede / whiche I wyll not And yf hit happend me to haue a wors / what shold hyt prouffite me to haue an euyll husbond after a good. And so she concluded that she wold kepe her chastete. Saynt Austyn reherceth in the book de Ciuitate dei that in rome was a noble lady gentill of maners  of hyghe kynrede named lucrecia / And had an husbonde named colatyne / whiche desired on a tyme the Emours sone named Torquyne thorguyllous or the proude and he was callid sixte for to come dyne and sporte hym in his castell or manoir And whan he was entrid amonge many no|ble ladyes he sawe lucrecia / And whan this Emours sone had seen  aduertised her deportes. her contenance. her manere. and her beaulte / he was all rauysshid and esprised wyth her loue forthwyth And espyed a tyme whan her husbonde collatyn wente vnto the ooste of

themour / and cam in to the place where as lucresse was with her felawship / whom she receyuyd honorably / and whan tyme came to goo to bedde and slepe she made redy a bedde ryally for hym as hit apperteyned to the empe|rours sone And this sixtus espyed where lucresia laye. And whan he supposyd  knewe that euery body was in his first sleep / he cam to the bedde of lucresse and that oon hand sette on her breste and in that other hand a na|ked swerd / and sayd to her / lucresse holde thy pees and crye not / For I am sixte tarquynus sone / for yf y^u speke ony worde thou shalt be dede / And for fere she held her pees / Than he began to praye and promise many thinges And after he menaced thretenyd her that she shold enclyne to hym to do his wyll / And whan he sawe he coude ner might haue his entent he sayd to her yf thou do not my wyll / I shall slee the and oo~n of thy seruantes and shall leye hym all ded by thy syde And than I shall saye that I haue slayn yow for your rybawdrye / And lucresse that than doubted more the shame of the world than the deth consentid to hym / And anone after as the Emours sone was departid / the ladye sente lres to her husbond her fader her brethern  to her frendes / and to a man callid brute conceyllour  neuewe to tarquyn / And sayd to them / that yesterday sixte the emours sone cam in to myn hous as an enemye in likenes of a frende /  hath oppressid me And knowe y^u colatyn that he hath dishono+rid thy bedde And how well y^t he hath fowled disho|nored my body / yet myn herte is not / wherfore I beseche the of pardon foryfnes  absolucion of the trespas but not of the payne / and he y^t hath doon this synne to me hit shall ben to his meschance yf ye doo your deuoir / And be cause

no woman take ensample of lucresse and lyue after the trespaas / but that she in lykewyse take ensample also of the payne And forthwyth wyth a swerd that she helde vnder her gowen or robe / she roof her self vnto the herte And deyde forthwyth to fore them / And than brute the counseillr And her husbond collatyn and alle her other frendes swore by the blood of lucresse that they wold neuer reste vnto the tyme that they had put out of rome tarquyn and alle his lignee / And that neuer after none of them shold come to dignite / And alle this was doon. For they bare the dede corps thurgh the cyte and meuyd the peple in suche wyse / that tarquyn was put in exyle And sixte his sone was slayn / A Quene ought to be well manerd  amonge alle she ought to be tumerous and shamefast / For whan a woman hath loste shame|fastnes / she may ner can not well be chaast / Wherfore saith symachus that they that ben not shamefast haue no conscience of luxurye / And saynt Ambrose saith that oon of the best parements and maketh a woman most fayr in her persone / is to be shamefast / Senecque reher|ceth that ther was oon named Archezille whiche was so shamefast That she put in a pelow of fethers a certain some of money / and put hit vnder y^e heed of a pour frende of heeris / whiche dissimyled his pouerte and wold not. ner durst not be a knowen of his pouerte For for shame she durst not gyue hit openly / but had leuer that he shold fynde hit / than that she had gyuen hit hym / wherfore otherwhile men shold gyue  helpe her frendes so secretly That they knowe not whens hit come / For whan we kepe hit secret and make no boost therof / our deedes and werkes shall plese god and them also / A Quene ought

to be chosen whan she shall be wedded of the most ho|nest kynrede and peple / For oftentymes the doughters folowen the tacches and maners of them that they ben discended from / wherof Valerius maximus sayth that ther was one that wold marye / whiche cam to a philo|sopher and axid counceyll what wif he might best take He answerd that he shold take her that thou knowe certaynly that her moder and her grauntdame haue ben chaast and well condicioned / For suche moder / suche doughter comunely / Also a quene ought to teche her chil+dern to ben contynent and kepe chastite entyerly / as hit is wreton in ecclesiastes / yf thou haue sones enseigne and teche them / And yf thou haue doughters kepe well them in chastite / For helemonde reherceth that euery kynge  prynce ought to be a clerke for to comande to other to studye and rede the lawe of our lord god / And ther|fore wrote themperour to the kynge of france that he shold doo lerne hys children sones the seuen sciences lyberall / And saide amonge other thynges that a kynge not lettryd resembleth an ass coroned / Themperour Octauian maad his sones to be taught and lerne to swyme. to sprynge and lepe. to Iuste. to playe wyth the axe and swerde / And alle maner thynge that ap|perteyneth to a knyght / And his doughters he made hem to lerne. to sewe. to spynne. to laboure as well in wolle as in lynnen cloth / And alle other werkis langynge to women And whan his frendes demanded wherfore he dyde so / he answerd how well that he was lord  syre of alle the world / yet wyste he not what shold befalle of his children and whether they shold falle or come to pouerte or noo / and therfore

yf they conne a good crafte they may alleway lyue ho|nestly / The Quene ought to kepe her doughters in alle chastyte / For we rede of many maydens that for theyr virginite haue ben made quenes / For poule the historia|graph of the lombardes reherceth y^t ther was a duchesse named remonde whiche had .iii. sones  two doughters And hit happend that the kynge of hongrye cantanus assaylled a castell where she  her children were Ie And on a day she behelde her enemyes And amonge all other she sawe the kynge that he was a well faryng and goodly man / Anone she was esprised and taken wyth his loue / And that so sore / that forthwith she sent to hym that she wold deliuere ouer the castell to hym yf he wold take her to his wyf and wedde her And he agreed therto / and sware that he wold haue her to his wyf on that condicion / whan than the kynge was in the castell / his peple toke men and women and alle that they fonde / her sones fledde from her / of whom one was named Ermoaldus and was yongest / and after was du of boneuentan / And syn kynge of the lumbardis. And the two susters toke chikens And put hem vnder her armes next the flessh and bytwene her pappes / that of the heete  chaffyng the flessh of the chikens stanke. And whan so was that they of hongrye wold haue en|forcid defowled hem anone they felte the stenche and fledde away and so lefte hem sayng / fy how these lom|bardes stynke / and so they kept their virginite / wherfore that one of them afterward was Quene of france And that other Quene of Aleman / And hit happend than that the kynge Catanus toke acordynge to his promyse the duchesse / and laye with her one night for to saue his oth

And on the morn he made her comune vnto alle the hon|gres / And the thirde day after he dyde doo put a staf of tre fro the nether part of her / thurgh her body vnto her throte or mouthe / for be cause of the lust of her flessh she betrayed her cyte and sayd suche husbond / suche wyf  And this sufficeth of the Quene.


The thirde chapitre of the seconde tractate treteth of the alphyns her offices and maners.
THe Alphyns ought to be made and formed in manere of Iuges syttynge in a chayer wyth a book open to fore their eyen / And that is be cause that some causes ben crymynell / And some ben cyuyle as aboute possessyons and other temporell thynges and trespaces / And therfore ought to be two Iuges in the royame / one in the black for the first cause / And that other in whyte as for the seconde / Theyr office is for to counceyll the kynge / And to make by his coman|dements good lawes And to enforme alle the royame in good and vertuous maners / And to Iuge and gyue sentence well and truly after the caas is had / And to counceyll well and Iustely alle them that axe counceyll of hem / wyth oute hauynge of ony eye opene to ony persone / And to estudye diligently in suche wyse and to ordeygne alle that / that ought to be kept be obseruyd be faste and stable / So that they be not founde corrupt for yeft for fauour ne for lignage ne for enuye variable And as touchynge the first poynt Seneque sayth in the book of benefetes that the poure Dyogenes was more stronge than Alixandre / For Alixandre coude not gyue so moche as Diogenes wold reffuse.
Marcus curus a romayn of grete renome sayth thus. That whan he had besiegid assayllyd them of samente And boneuentans whiche herde that he was poure / they toke a grete masse and wegghe of gold and sended hit to hym prayng hym that he wold resseyue hyt and leue his assault and siege / And whan they cam with the pre|sent to hym they fonde hym sittynge on the erthe and ete his mete oute of platers and disshes of tree and of wode and dyde than her message / to whom he answerd and sayde that they shold goo hoome and saye to them that sente hem that marcus cursus loueth better to be lord and wynne richesses than richesse shold wynne hym / For by bataylle he shall not be ouercome and vaynquysshid Nor be gold ne siluer he shal~ not be corrupt ne corompid Often tymes that thynge taketh an euyll ende that is vn|trewe for gold and siluer / And that a man is subgett vnto money may not be lord therof / helimond reherceth that demonscene demanded of aristodone how moche he had wonne for pletynge of a cause for his clyent / And he answerd a marck of gold / Demoscenes answerd to hym agayn that he had wonne as moche for to hold his pees and speke not Thus the tonges of aduocates and men of lawe ben yllous and domegeable / yet they must be had yf thou wylt wynne thy cause for wyth money and yeft thou shall wynne And oftetymes they selle as welle theyr scilence / as theyr vtterance / Valerius reher|ceth that the senatours of rome toke counceyll to geder of two persones that one was poure / And that other riche and couetous / whiche of hem bothe were most apte for to sende to gouerne and Iuge the contre of spayne / and scipion of affricque sayd that none of them bothe were

good ner prouffitable to be sente theder / For that one hath no thynge And to that other may nothynge suffise And despised in his saynge alle pouerte and auerice in a Iuge / For a couetous man hath nede of an halfpeny For he is seruant  bonde vnto money / and not lord therof. But pouerte of herte  of wylle ought to be gretly alo|wed in a Iuge Therfore we rede that as longe as the ro|mayns louyd pouerte they were lordes of all the world For many ther were that exposed alle their goodes for the comyn wele and for that was most prouffitable for the comynaulte that they were so poure that whan they were dede they were buryed  brought to erthe with the comyn good / And theyr doughters were maryed by the mandement of the senatours / But syn that they despi|sed pouert / And begonne to gadre rychesses / And ue maad grete bataylles / they haue vsed many synnes And so the comyn wele perysshid / For there is no synne but that it regneth there / Ther is none that is so ynfull as he that hath alle the world in despyte / For he is in pees that dredeth no man / And he is ryche that coueyteth no thynge / Valere reherceth that he is not ryche that moche hath / But he is ryche that hath lytyll and coueyteth no thynge / Than thus late the Iuges take hede that they enclyne not for loue or for hate in ony Iugement / For theophrast saith that alle loue is blynde ther loue is / ther can not ryght Iugement by gyuen / For alle loue is blynde And therfore loue is none euyn Iuge For ofte tymes loue Iugeth a fowll  lothly woman to be fayr And so reherceth quynte curse in his first book that the grete Godaches sayth the same to Alixandre

men may saye in this caas that nature is euyll For euery man is lasse auysed and worse in is owne feet and cause than in an other mans / And therfore the Iuges ought to kepe hem well from yre in Iugement / Tullius sayth that an angry  yrous sone weneth that for to doo euyll / is good counceyll / and socrates saith y^t .ii. thinges ben con+traryous to cou~ceyll / and they ben hastynes  wrath / and Galeren sayth in Alexandrye / yf yre or wrath ouercome the whan thou sholdest gyue Iugement / weye all thinge in y^e balance so that thy Iugement be not enclyned by loue ne by yefte / ne fauour of persone torne not thy corage. Helemond reherceth that Cambyses kynge of perse whiche was a rightwys kynge had an vnrightwys Iuge / whiche for enuye and euyll will had dampned a man wrongfully and agaynst right / wherfore he dide hym to be flain all quyk / and made the chayer or siege of Iugement to be couerid wyth his skyn / And made his sone Iuge and to sitte in the chayer on the skyn of his fa|der / to thende that the sone shold Iuge rightwysly / And abhorre the Iugement  payne of his fader / Iuges ought to punysshe the defaultes egally And fullfille the lawe that they ordeyne / Caton sayth accomplisshe and do the lawe in suche wyse as thou hast ordeyned and gyuen. Valerius reherceth that calengius a consull had a sone whiche was taken in adwultrye. And therfore after the lawe at that tyme he was dampned to lose bothe his eyen The fader wold y^t the lawe shold be acco~plisshid in his sone with out fauour / but all the cyte was meuyd herewyth And wold not suffre hit / but in the ende his fa+der was vaynquysshid by theyr prayers / And ordeyned that his sone shold lese oon eye whiche was put oute

And he hym self lost an other eye / And thus was the lawe obserued and kept / And the prayer of the peple was accomplisshid We ede y^t ther was a counceyllour of rome that had gyuen counceill to make a statute / that who some euer that entrid in to the senatoire /  a swerd gyrt aboute hym shold be ded / Than hit happend on a tyme that he cam from with out and entrid in to the sena+toyre  his swerd gyrt aboute hym / wherof he took no~n heede / and o~n of the senatours told hym of hit / and whan he knewe hit  remembrid the statute / he drewe oute his swerd  slewe hym self to fore them / rather to dye than to breke the lawe / for whos deth all the senatours made grete sorowe / but alas we fynde not many in thise dayes that soo doo / but they doo lyke as anastasius saith that the lawes of some ben lyke vnto the nettis of spyncoppis that take no grete bestes  fowles but lete goo  flee thurgh. But they take flyes  gnattes  suche smale thynges / In lyke wise the lawes now a dayes ben not executed but vpon the poure peple / the grete and riche breke hit  goo thurgh with all And for this cause sourden bataylles  discordes / and make y^e grete  riche men to take by force and strengthe lordshippis  seignouries vpon the smale  poure peple / And this doon they specially that ben gentill of lignage  poure of goodes And causeth them to robbe and reue And yet co~strayned them by force to serue them And this is no meruayll / for they that drede not to angre god / ner to breke the lawe and to false hit / Falle often tymes by force in moche cursednes and wikkidnes / but whan y^e grete peple doo acordinge to y^e lawe / and punysh the tra~sgressours sharply The comyn peple abstayne and withdrawe hem fro dooyng of euyll / and chastiseth hem

self by theyr example / And the Iuges ought to entende for to studie / for y^t yf smythes the carpe~tiers y^t vignours and other craftsmen saye that it is most necessarye to studye for the comyn prouffit And gloryfye them in their connyng and saye that they ben prouffitable Than shold the Iuges studie and contemplaire moche more than they in that / that shold be for the comyn wele / wherfore sayth seneke beleue me that they seme that they do no thynge they doo more than they that laboure For they doo spiry|tuell and also corporall werkis / and therfore amonge Artificers ther is no plesant reste / But that reson of the Iuges hath maad and ordeyned hit / And therfore ange|lius in libro actiui atticatorum de socrate sayth That so|crates was on a tyme so pensyf that in an hole naturell daye / He helde one estate that he ne meuyd mouth ne eye ne foote ne hand but was as he had ben ded rauysshyd. And whan one demanded hym wherfore he was so pen|syf / he answerd in alle worldly thynges and labours of the same And helde hym bourgoys and cytezeyn of the world And valerius reherceth that carnardes a knyght was so sage wyse and laborous in pensifnes of the co|myn wele / that whan he was sette at table for to ete / he forgate to put his hande vnto the mete to fede hym self. And therfore his wyf y^t was named mellyse whom he had taken more to haue her companye  felawship than for ony other thynge / Fedde hym to thende that he shold not dye for honger in his pensifnes / Dydymus sayd to Alixandrie we ben not deynseyns in the world but strau~+gers / ner we ben not born in the world for to dwell and abyde allway therin / but for to goo and passe thurgh hit / we haue doon noon euyll dede / but that it is worthy

to be punysshid and we to suffre payne therfore And than we may goon with opon face and good conscience And so may we goo lightly and appertly the waye that we hope and purpose to goo This suffiseth as for the Alphyns.


The fourth chapitre of the seconde book treteth of the ordre of cheualerye and knyghthode and of her offices and maners.
THe knyght ought to be made alle armed vpon an hors in suche wyse that he haue an helme on his heed and a spere in his ryght hande / and coue+ryd wyth his sheld / a swerde and a mace on his lyft syde / Cladd wyth an hawberk and plates to fore his brest / legge harnoys on his legges / Spores on his heelis on his handes his gauntelettes / his hors well broken and taught and apte to bataylle and couerid with his armes / whan the knyghtes ben maad they ben bayned or bathed / that is the signe that they shold lede a newe lyf and newe maners / also they wake alle the nyght in prayers and orysons vnto god that he wylle gyue hem grace that they may gete that thynge that they may not gete by nature / The kynge or prynce gyrdeth a boute them a swerde in signe / that they shold abyde and kepe hym of whom they take theyr dispenses and dignyte. Also a knyght ought to be wise. liberall. trewe. stronge and full of mercy and pite and kepar of the peple and of the lawe / And ryght as cheualrye passeth other in vertu in dignite in honour and in reuerece / right so ought he to surmounte alle other in vertu / For honour is no thing ellis but to do reuerece to an other sone for y^e good  vertuo disposicion y^t is in hym / A noble knyght ought

to be wyse and preuyd to fore he be made knyght / hit be|houed hym that he had longe tyme vsid the warre and armes / that he may be expert and wyse for to gouerne the other For syn that a knyght is capitayn of a batayll The lyf of them that shall be vnder hym lyeth in his hand And therfore behoueth hym to be wyse and well aduy|sed / for some tyme  and engyue is more worth than strengthe or hardynes of a man that is not proued in Armes / For otherwhyle hit happeth that whan the prynce of the batayll affieth and trusteth in his hardynes and strength And wole not vse wysedom and engyne for to renne vpon his enemyes / he is vaynquysshid and his peple slayn / Therfore saith the philosopher that no man shold chese yong peple to be captayns  gouernours For as moche as ther is no certainte in her wysedom. Alexandre of macedone vaynquysshid and conquerid Egypte Iude Caldee Affricque / and Assirye vnto the marches of bragmans more by the counceyll of olde men than by the strength of the yong men / we rede in the histo|rye of rome y^t ther was a knyght whiche had to name malechete that was so wyse and trewe that whan the Emour Theodosius was dede / he made mortall warre ayenst his broder germain whiche was named Gildo or Guye For as moche as this said guye wold be lorde of affricque with oute leue and wyll of the senatours. And this sayd guye had slayn the two sones of his bro+der malechete / And dide moche torment vnto the cristen peple And afore that he shold come in to the felde ayenst his broder Emyon / he wente in to an yle of capayre And ladde with hym alle the cristen men that had ben sente the|der in Exyle And made hem alle to praye wyth hym by

the space of thre dayes  thre nyghtis / For he had grete truste in the prayers of good folk /  specially that noman myght counceyll ne helpe but god / and .iii. dayes to fore he shold fight say  Ambrose whiche was ded a lityl~ to fore apperid to hym / and shewde hym by reuelacion the tyme  our that he shold haue victorie / and for as moche as he had ben .iii. dayes and .iii. nyghtes in his prayers  that he was assewrid for to haue victorie / He faught with .v. thousand men ayenst his broder y^t had in his com+panye .xxiiii. thousand men And by goddes helpe he had victorie And whan the barbaryns y^t were comen to helpe guion sawe y^e disconfiture they fledde away / and guion fledd also in to affricque by shipp / and whan he was ther arryued he was sone after stranglid / These .ii. knyghtes of whom I speke were two birdern germayns / whiche were sent to affricque for to defende the comyn weele / In likewise Iudas machabe Ionathas  symon his bredern put hem self in the mercy and garde of our lord god And agayn the enemyes of the lawe of god with lityll peple in regard of the multitude that were agayn them / and had also victorye / The knights ought to ben trewe to theyr princes / for he that is not trewe leseth y^e name of a knight Vnto a prince trouth is the grettest precious stone whan it is medlid with Iustice / Paule the historiagraph of the lombardes reherceth that ther was a knight named enul+phus and was of the cyte of papye that was so trewe to his kynge named patharich / that he put hym in parill of deth for hym / For hit happend that Grymald Duc of buuentayns of whom we haue touched to fore in the chapitre of the Quene / Dyde do shee Godebert whiche was kynge of the lombardes by the hande of Goribert

duc of Tauryn / whiche was discended of the crowne of lombardis And this grimald was maad kynge of lombardis in his place / and after this put  bannysshid out of the contrey this patharych whiche was broder vnto the kynge Godebert / that for fere and drede fledd in to hongrye / And than this knyght Enulphus dide so moche that he gate the peas agayn of his lord patharich agaynst the kynge grymalde / and that he had licence to come out of hongrye where he was allwey in paryll. and so he cam and cryed hym mercy And the kynge gry|malde gaf hym leue to dwelle and to lyue honestly in his contree / allway forseen that he toke not vpon hym and named hym self kynge how well he was kynge by right This doon a litill while after / the kynge that beleuyd euyll tonges / thought in hym self how he myght brynge this patharich vnto the deth And alle this knewe well the knyght enulphus / whiche cam the same nyght with his squyer for to visite his lord And made his squyer to vnclothe hym  to lye in the bedde of his lord And made his lord to ryse and clothe hym wyth the clothis of his squyer / And in this wyse brought hym oute / brawlynge and betynge hym as his seruant by them that were assig|ned to kepe the hows of patharik y^t he shold not escape Whiche supposid that hit had ben his squyer that he en|tretid so outragiously /  so he brought hym to his hous whiche Ioyned with the walles of the toun / And at mydnyght whan alle men were a sleepe / he lete a doun his maistre by a corde / whiche toke an hors oute of the pasture And fled vnto the cyte of Aast and ther cam to the kynge of fraunce / And whan hit cam vnto the morn. Hit was founden that Arnolphus and his squyer had

dereyuyd the kynge and the wacchemen / whom the kyng comanded shold be brought to fore hym And demanded of them the maner how he was escaped And they told hym the trouthe / Than the kynge demanded his counceyll of what deth they had deseruyd to dye that had so doon and wrought agayn the wylle of hym / Some sayde that they shold ben honged / and some sayd they shold ben flayn And other sayd that they shold be beheedid. Than sayd the kynge by that lord that made me / they ben not worthy to dye / but for to haue moche worship and honour / For they haue ben trewe to theyr lord / wherfore  kinge gaf hem a grete lawde and honour for their seet And after hit happend that the propre squyer and ser|uant of godeberd slewe the traytre Goribalde that by  had slayn his lord at a feste of seynt Iohn in his  of Tauryn wherof he was lord and duc / Thus ought the knyghtes to loue to gyder / And eche to put his lyf in auenture for other / For so ben they the strenger And the more doubted / Lyke as were the noble knygh|tes Ioab and Abysay that fought agaynst the syryens and Amonytes / And were so trewe that oon to that other that they vaynquysshid theyr enemies And were so Ioyned to gyder that yf the siryens were strenger than that one of them / that other helpe hym / we rede that damon and phisias were so ryght parfyt frendes to gyder that whan Dionisius whiche was kynge of cecylle had Iu+ged one to deth for his trespaas in the cyte of syracusane whom he wold haue executed / he desired grace and leue to goo in to hys contre for to dispose and ordonne his tes|tament / And his felawe pleggid hym and was sewrte for hym vpon his heed that he shold come agayn.
Wherof they that sawe  herd this / helde hym for a fool~ and blamed hym / And he said allway that he repentid hym nothynge at all / For he knewe well the trouth of his felawe And whan the day cam and the oure that exe+cusion shold be doon / his felawe cam and presented hym self to fore the Iuge / And dischargid his felawe that was plegge for hym / wherof the kynge was gretly abas+shid And for the grete trouthe that was founden in hym He pardonyd hym and prayd hem bothe that they wold resseyue hym as their grete frende and felawe / Lo here the vertues of loue that a man ought nought to doubte the deth for his frende / Lo what it is to doo for a frende / And to lede a lyf debonayr And to be wyth out cruelte / to loue and not to hate / whiche causeth to doo good ayenst euyll And to torne payne in to benefete and to quenche cruelte Anthonyus sayth that Iulius Cesar / lefte not lightly frenshippe and Amytye / But whan he had hit he retey|ned hit faste and mayteyned hit alleway / Scipion of Affricque sayth that ther is no thynge so stronge / as for to mayntene loue vnto the deth The loue of concupiscence and of lecherye is sone dissoluyd and broken / But the verray true loue of the comyn wele and prouffit now a dayes is selde founden / where shall thou fynde a man in thyse dayes that wyll expose hym self for the worshippe and honour of his frende / or for the comyn wele / selde or neuer shall he be founden / Also the knyghtes shold be large  liberall For whan a knyght hath regarde vnto his singuler prouffit by his couetyse / he dispoylleth his peple For whan the souldyours see that they putte hem in paryll. And theyr mayster wyll not paye hem theyr wages liberally / but entendeth to his owne propre gayn

and prouffyt / than whan the Enemyes come they torne sone her backes and flee oftentymes / And thus hit hap|peth by hym that entendeth more to gete money than victo+rye that his auaryce is ofte tymes cause of his confusion Than late euery knyght take heede to be liberall in suche wyse that he wene not ne suppose that his scarcete be to hym a grete wynnynge or gayn / And for thys cause he be the lasse louyd of his peple / And that his aduersarye wythdrawe to hym them by large gyuynge / For ofte tyme bataylle is auaunced more for getynge of siluer. Than by the force and strengthe of men / For men see all daye that suche thynges as may not be achieuyd by force of nature / ben goten and achieuyd by force of money / And for so moche hit behoueth to see well  that whan the tyme of the bataylle cometh / that he borowe not ne make no tyllage / For noman may be ryche that leuyth his owne / hopyng to gete and take of other / Than allwaye all her gayn and wynnynge ought to be comyn amonge them exept theyr Armes. For in lyke wyse as the victorie is comune / so shold the dispoyll and lotye be comune vnto them And ther+fore Dauid that gentyll knyght in the fyrst book of kynges in the last chapitre made a lawe / that he that abode behynde by maladye or sekenes in the tentes shold haue as moche parte of the butyn as he that had be in the bataylle / And for the loue of thys lawe he was made afterward kynge of Israell / Alexander of Macedone cam on a tyme lyke a symple knyght vnto the court of Porus kynge of Iude for to espye thestate of the kynge and of the knyghtes of the court / And the kynge ressey+uyd hym ryght worshipfully / And demanded of hym

many thynges of Alexander and of his constance and strengthe / nothynge wenynge that he had ben Alexander But antygone one of his knyghtis and after he had hym to dyner And whan they had seruyd Alexander in vays|sell of gold and siluer with dyuerce metes  After that he had eten suche as plesid hym he wyded the mete and toke the vayssell and helde hit to hym self and put hit in his bosom or sleuys / wherof he was accusid vnto the kynge After dyner than the kynge callid hym and deman+ded hym wherfore he had taken his vayssell And he ans+werd / Syre kynge my lord I pray the to vnderstande and take heede thy self and also thy knyghtes / I haue herd moche of thy grete hyenes And y^t thou art more myghty and puyssant in cheualrye  in dispensis than is Alexan|der / and therfore I am come to the a pour knyght whiche am named Antygone for to serue the / Than hit is the cus|tome in the Courte of Alexandre / that what thynge a knyght is seruyd wyth all is alle his / mete and vayssell and cuppe And therfore I had supposid that this custome had ben kept in thy court for thou art richer than he / whan the knyghtes herd this / ano~n they lefte porus / and wente for to serue alixandre / and thus he drewe to hym y^e hertes of them by yeftes / whiche afterward slewe Porus that was kynge of Iude / And they made Alexandre kynge therof Therfore remembre knyght alleway that wyth a closid and shette purse shalt thou neuer haue victorye. Ouyde sayth that he that taketh yeftes / he is glad ther|wyth / For they wynne wyth yeftes the hertes of the goddes and of men For yf Iupiter were angrid / wyth yeftes he wold be plesid / The knyghtes ought to be stronge not only of body but also in corage. Ther ben

many stronge and grete of body / that ben faynt and fe|ble in the herte / he is stronge that may not be vaynquys|shid and ouercomen / how well that he suffryth moche otherwhile / And so we beleue that they that be not ouer grete ne ouer lityll ben most corageous  beste in batayll. We rede that cadrus duc of athenes shold haue a batayll agayn them of polipe / And he was warned and had a reuelacion of the goddes / that they shold haue the victorie of whom the prynce shold be slayn in the batayll / And the prnce whiche was of a grete corage and trewe herte oke other armes of a poure man / And put hym self in the fronte of the batayll to thende that he might be slain And so he was / for the right trewe prince had leuer dye Than his peple shold be ouercomen / And so they had the victorye / Certes hyt was a noble and fayr thynge to expose hym self to the deth for to deffende his contrey. But no man wold doo so / but yf he hopyd to haue a bet+ter thynge therfore / Therfore the lawe sayth that they lyue in her sowles gloriously that ben slain in the warre for the comyn wele / A knyght ought also to be mercifull and pyetous For ther is nothynge y^t maketh a knyght so renomed as is whan he sauyth the lyf of them that he may slee / For to shede and spylle blood is the condicion of a wylde beste and not the condicion of a good knyght Therfore we rede that scylla that was Duc of the Ro|mayns wyth oute had many fayr victoyres agaynst the Romayns wyth Iune that were contrayre to hym / In so moche that in the batayll of puylle he slewe .xviii. thousand men / And in champanye .lxx. thousand. And after in the cyte he slewe thre thousand men vnar|med And whan one of his knyghtes that was named

Quyntus catulus sawe this cruelte sayd to hym / Sesse now and suffre them to lyue and be mercyfull to them wyth whom we haue ben victorious And wyth whom we ought to lyue / For hit is the moste hyeft and fayr vengeance that a man may doo / as to spare them  gyue hem her lyf whome he may slee Therfore Ioab ordeyned whan absalon was slayn / he sowned a trompette / that his peple shold no more renne  slee theyr aduersaryes. For ther were slayn aboute .xx. thousand of them / and in lyke wyse dide he whan he faught ayenst Abner And Abner was vaynquysshid and fledde For where that he wente in the chaas he comanded to spare the peple The knyghtes ought to kepe the peple / For whan the peple ben in theyr tentes or castellis / the knyghtes ought to kepe the wacche / For this cause the romayns callyd them le|gyons And they were made of dyuerce prouynces and of dyuerce nacyons to thentente to kepe the peple / And the peple shold entende to theyr werke / For no crafty man may bothe entende to his craft  to fighte how may a crafty man entende to hys werke sewrely in tyme of warre but yf he be kept And right in suche wyse as the knyghtes shold kepe y^e peple in tyme of peas in lyke wise the peple ought to pourveye for theyr dispensis / how shold a plowman be sewre in the felde / but yf the knygh|tes made dayly wacche to kepe hem For lyke as the glo|rye of a kynge is vpon his knyghtis / so hit is necessarye to the knyghtes that the marchantis craftymen and co|myn peple be defended and kepte / therfore late the knygh+tes kepe the peple in suche wyse that they maye enioye pees and gete and gadre the cosis and expensis of them bothe / we rede that Athis sayd to dauid whiche was

a knyght / I make the my kepar and defendar alleway. Thus shold the knightes haue grete zele that the lawe be kept / For the mageste ryall ought not only to be gar|nysshid wyth armes but also wyth good lawes / And therfore shold they laboure that they shold be well kept Turgeus pompeyus reherceth of a noble knyght named Ligurgyus that had made auncyent lawes the whiche the peple wold not kepe ne obserue / For they semed hard for them to kepe And wold constrayne hym to ra|pele  sette hem a part whan the noble knight sawe that He dyde the peple to vnderstande that he had not made them but a god that was named Apollo delphynus had made them / And had comanded hym that he shold do the peple kepe them / Thise wordes auayled not / they wold in no wyse kepe them / And than he sayd to them that hit were good that er the said lawes shold be broken that he had gyuen to them. that he shold goo and speke wyth the god Appollo / For to gete of hym a dispensacion to breke hem / And that the peple shold kepe  obserue them tyll that he retorned agayn / The peple acorded therto  swore that they shold kepe them to the tyme he retorned Than the knight wente in to grece in exyle  dwellid ther alle his lyf / And whan he shold dye he comanded that his body shold be cast in the see / For as moche as yf his body shold be born theder / the peple shold wene to be quyt of theyr oth / And shold kepe no lenger his lawes that were so good  resonable /  so the knight had leuer to forsake his owne contre  to dye so than to repele his lawes And his lawes were suche / The first lawe was that y^e peple shold obeye  serue the princes / And the prin+ces shold kepe the peple  do Iustice on the malefactours

The second lawe that they shold be all sobre / For he wiste well that the labour of cheualrye is most stronge whan they lyue sobrely / The thirde was y^e noman shold bye ony thynge for money but they shold change ware for ware  one marchandyse for an other / The fourthe was that men shold sette nomore by money ner kepe hit more than they wold donge or fylthe / The fyfthe he or|deyned for the comyn wele alle thynge by ordre / that the prynces myght meue and make bataylle by her power. to the maistres counceillours he comysid the Iugementis. And the Annuell rentes / to the senatours the kepynge of the lawe / And to the comyn peple he gaf power to chese suche Iuges as they wold haue / The sixte he ordey+ned that all thinge shold be departid egally  all thinge shold be comyn And none richer than other in patrymo|nye / The seuenth that euery man shold ete lyke well in comen openly / that riches shold not be cause of luxurye whan they ete secretly / The eygthe that the yonge peple shold not haue but o~n gowne or garment in the yere / The nynth that men shold sette poure children to laboure in the felde / to thende that they shold not enploye theyr yongthe in playes and in folye / but in labour / The tenthe that the maydens shold be maryed wythoute dowayre / In suche wyse that no man shold take a wyf for moneye / The xi. that men shold rather take a wyf for her good ma|ners and vertues than for her richesses / The twelfthe that men shold worshippe the olde and auncyent men for theyr age and more for theyr wysedom than for her riches this knyght made none of thyse lawes / but he first kepte hem.


The fyfthe chapitre of the second book of the forme

and maners of the rooks.
THe rooks whiche ben vicaires and legats of the kynge ought to be made lyke a knyght vpon an hors and a mantell and hood furryd with me|neuyer holdynge a staf in his hande /  for as moche as a kyng my not be in alle places of his royame / Therfore the auctorite of hym is gyuen to the rooks / whiche repre|sent the kynge / And for as moche as a royame is grete and large / and that rebellion or nouelletes might sourdre and aryse in oon partye or other / therfore ther ben two rooks one on the right side and that other on the lifte side They ought to haue in hem. pyte. Iustice. humylite. wilfull pouerte and liberalite / Fyrst Iustice for hit is most fayr of the vertues / For hit happeth oftetyme that the minis|tris by theyr pryde and orgueyll subuerte Iustice and do no ryght / Wherfore the kynges otherwhile lose theyr royames with out theyr culpe or gylte / For an vntrewe Iuge or ofcyer maketh hys lord to be named vn Iuste and euyll And contrarye wyse a trewe mynestre of the lawe and ryghtwys / causeth the kynge to be reputed Iuste and trewe / The Romayns therfore made good lawes / And wolde that / that they sholde be Iuste and trewe / And they that establisshid them for to gouerne the peple wold in no wyse breke them / but kepe them for to dye for them / For the auncyent and wyse men sayd comynly that it was not good to make and ordeygne that lawe that is not Iuste Wherof Valerius reher|ceth that ther was a man that was named Themis|tides whiche cam to the counceyllours of athenes and sayd that he knewe a counceyll whiche was ryght prouffytable for them / But he wolde telle hyt but to

but to one of them whom that they wold / And they as|signed to hym a wyse man named Aristides / And whan he had vnderstand hym he cam agayn to the other of the counceyll And sayd that the counceyll of Themystides was well prouffitable / but hit was not Iuste / how be hit ye may reuolue hit in your mynde / And the counceyll that he sayd was this / that ther were comen two grete shipp is fro lacedome and were arryued in theyr londe. And that hit were good to take them / And whan the counceyll herde hym that sayde / that hit was not Iuste ner right / they lefte hem alle in pees And wold not haue adoo with alle / The vicarye or Iuge of the kynge ought to be so Iuste / that he shold enploye alle his entente to saue the comyn wele And yf hit were nede to put his lyf and / lose hit therfore / we haue an ensample of marcus regulus wherof Tullius reherceth in the book of offices And saynt Augustyn also de ciuitate dei how he faught agayn them of cartage by see in shippis and was vayn|quysshid and taken / Than hit happend that they of car|tage sente hym in her message to rome for to haue theyr prisoners there / for them y^t were taken / and so to chau~ge one for an other And made hym swere and promyse to come agayn / And so he cam to rome And made proposi|cion to fore the senate And demanded them of cartage of the senatours to be chau~ged as afore is sayd And than the senatours demanded hym what counceyll he gaf Cer+tayn sayd he I cou~ceyll yow that ye do hit not in no wise For as moche as the peple of rome that they of cartage holde in prison of youris ben olde men and brusid in the warre as I am my self / But they that ye holde in prison of their peple is alle the flour of alle their folke / whiche

counceyll they toke / And than his frendes wolde haue holde hym and counceyllyd hym to abide there and not retorne agayn prysoner in to cartage / but he wold neuer doo so ner abide / but wold goo agayn and kepe his oth How well that he knewe that he wente toward his deth For he had leuyr dye than to breke his oth Valeri reherceth in the sixth book of one Emelye duc of the ro|mayns / that in the tyme whan he had assieged the pha|listes / The scole maystre of the children deceyuyd the children of the gentilmen that he drewe hym a lityll and a lytyll vnto the tentys of the romayns by fayr speche. And sayd to the duc Emelie / that by the moyan of the children that he had brought to hym / he shold haue the cyte / For theyr faders were lordes and gouernours. Whan Emelie had herde hym he sayd thus to hym Thou that art euyll and cruell And thou that woldest gyue a gyfte of grete felonnye and of maastye / thou shalt ner hast not founden here Duc ne peple that resembleth the / we haue also well lawes to kepe in batayll  warre A in our contres  other places / and we wole obserue and kepe them vnto euery man as they ought to be kept And we ben armed agaynst our enemyes y^t wole defende them And not ayenst them y^t can not saue their lyf whan their contre is taken / as thise lityll children / Thou hast va+ynquysshid them as moche as is in the by thy newe decey+able falsenes and by subtilnes and not by armes / but I that am a romayn shall vainquysshe them by craft and strengthe of armes / And anon he comanded to take the said scole maister / And to bynde his handes behynde hym as a traytour and lede hem to the parentis of the children And whan the faders  parentis sawe the grete courtosie

that he had don to them They opend the yates and yelded them vnto hym / we rede that hanyball had taken a prince of rome whiche vpon his oth and promyse suffrid hym to gon home / and to sende hym his raunson / or he shold come agayn within a certain tyme And whan he was at home in his place / he sayde that he had deceyuyd hym by a false oth And whan the senatours knewe therof / they constrayned hym to retorne agayn vnto hanyball / Amos+florus tellyth that the phisicien of kynge pirrus cam on a nyght to fabrice his aduersarye And promysid hym yf he wold gyue hym for his laboure that he wold enpoy|sone pirrus his maister / whan fabricius vnderstode this He dyde to take hym and bynde hym hande  foote / and sente hym to his maistre and dyde do saye to hym word for worde lyke as the phisicien had sayd and promysid hym to doo / And whan pirrus vnderstode this he was gretly ameruaylled of the loyalte and trouth of fabrice his enemye / and sayd certaynly that the sonne myghte lighther and sonner be enpesshid of his cours / than fa|brice shold be letted to holde loyalte and trouthe / yf they than that were not cristen were so Iuste and trewe and  louyd their contrey and their good renomee / what shold we now doon than that ben cristen and that oure lawe is sette alle vpon loue and charyte / But now a dayes ther is nothynge ellys in the world but barate Treson deceyte falsenes and trecherye Men kepe not theyr couenantes promyses. othes. writynges. ne trouthe / The subgettis rebelle agayn theyr lorde / ther is now no lawe kepte. nor fidelite / ne oth holden / the peple murmure and ryse agayn theyr lord and wole not be subget / they ought to be pitous in herte / whiche is auaillable to all thinge

ther is pite in effecte by compassion / and in worde by remis+sion and pardon / by almesse / for to enclyne hym self to the poure. For pite Is nothynge ellis but a right grete will of a debonaire herte for to helpe alle men / Valerius reher+ceth that ther was a Iuge named sangis whiche damp+ned a woman that had deseruyd the deth for to haue her heed smyten of or ellis that she shold dye in prison / The Geayler that had pite on the woman put not her anone to deth but put her in the pryson / And this woman had a doughter whiche cam for to se and conforte her moder But allway er she entryd in to the pryson the Iayler serchid her that she shold bere no mete ne drynke to her moder / but that she shold dye for honger / Than hit hap|pend after this that he meruaylled moche why this wo+man deyd not / And began to espye the cause why she lyuyd so longe / And fonde at laste how her doughter gaf souke to her moder / And fedde her with her melke. whan the Iayler sawe this meruaill / he wente  told the Iuge / And whan the Iuge sawe this grete pite of the doughter to the moder he pardoned her and made her to be delyuerid oute of her pryson what is that / that pite ne amolisshith / moche peple wene that it is agaynst nature and wondre that the doughter shold gyue the moder to souke / hit were agayn nature but the children shold be kynde to fader and moder / Seca sayth that the kynge of bees hath no prykke to stynge with as other bees haue. And that nature hath take hit away from hym be cause he shold haue none armes to assaylle them And this is an example vnto prynces that they shold be of the same condicion / Valerius reherceth in his .v. book of marchus martellus that whan he had taken the cyte of siracusane.

And was sette in the hyest place of the cyte / he behelde the grete destruction of the peple and of the cyte / he wepte and sayde / thou oughtest to be sorofull / for so moche as thou woldest haue no pite of thy self / But enioye the for thou art fallen in the hande of a right debonaire prynce. Also he recounteth whan pompeye had conqueryd the kynge of Germanye that often tymes had foughten ayenst the romayns And that he was brought to fore hym bounden / he was so pietous that he wold not suffre hym to be longe on his knees to fore hym / but he receyuyd hym cortoysly And sette the crowne agayn on his heed and put hym in the state that he was to fore / For he had oppynyon that hit was as worshipfull and sittynge to a kynge to pardone / as to punysshe. Also he reherceth of a cou~ceyllour that was named poule that dide do brynge to fore hym a man that was prisonner And as he knelid to fore hym he toke hym vp fro the ground  made hym to sytte beside hym for to gyue hym good esperance and hoope And sayd to the other stondynge by / in this wyse. yf hit be grete noblesse that we shewe our self contrarye to our enemyes / than this fete ought to be alowed that we shewe our self debonair to our caytyfs  prisonners Cesar whan he herde the deth of cathon whiche was his aduersarye sayde that he had grete enuye of his glorye. And no thinge of his patrimonye / and therfore he lefte to his children frely alle his patrimonye Thus taught vyrgyle and enseygned the gloryus prynces to rewle and gouerne the peple of rome And saynt Augustin de ciuitate de saith thus Thou emperour gouerne the peple pietously And make peas ouerall / deporte and forbere thy subgets / repreue  correcte the prowde / for so enseyne

And teche the the lawes / And hit was wreton vnto Alexander / that euery prynce ought to be pyetous in pu|nysshynge / And redy for to rewarde / Ther is no thynge that causeth a prynce to be so belouyd of hys peple / As whan he speketh to hem swetly / and co~uersith with hem symply / And all this cometh of the roote of pyte / we rede of the Emperour Traian that his frendes repreuyd hym of that he was to moche pryue and familier wyth the comyn peple more than an emperour ought to be / And he answerd that he wold be suche an emperour as euery man desired to haue hym / Also we rede of Alixander that on a tyme he ladde his oost forth hastely / and in that haste he beheld where satte an olde knight that was sore a colde Whom he dide do arise and sette hym in his owne sete or siege / what wondre was hit though y^e knightes desired to serue suche a lord that louyd better theyr helth than his dignite / The rookes ought also to be humble  meke After the holy scripture whiche saith / the gretter or in the hier astate that thou arte / so moche more oughtest thou be meker  more humble Valerius reherceth in his .vii. book that ther was an emperour named publius cesar / That dide do bete doun his hows whiche was in the middis of y^e market place for as moche as hit was heier than other houses / for as moche as he was more glorious in astate than other / Therfore wold he haue a lasse hous than other And scipion of affrique that was so poure of volu~tarie pouerte y^t whan he was dede / he was buried at y^e dispencis of y^e comyn good / They shold be so humble y^t they shold leue theyr offices / and suffre other to take hem whan her tyme comyth /  doo honour to other / for he gouerneth wel~ y^e royame y^t may gouerne hit whan he will Valeri saith

In his thirde book that fabyan the grete had ben maistre counceyllour of his fader his grauntsire / And of his grauntsirs fader  of alle his antecessours And yet dide he alle his payne and labour / that his sone shold neuer haue that office after hym / but for nothynge that he mys|trusted his sone / For he was noble and wise and more attemprid than other / but he wold that the office shold not allway reste in the familye and hows of the faby|ans Also he reherceth in his seuenth book that they wold make the sayd fabyan emour / but he excused hym and sayd that he was blynde and myght not see for age / but that excusacion myght not helpe hym / Than sayd he to hem / seke ye and gete yow another / For yf ye make me your emour I may not suffre your maners / nor ye may not suffre myn / Ther was a kynge of so subtyll engyne That whan men brought hym the crowne / to fore that he toke hit / he remembrid hym a lityll and saide O thou crowne that art more noble than happy For yf a kynge knewe well and parfaytly how that thou art full~ of paryls of thoughte and of charge / yf thou were on the grounde / he wolde neuer lyfte ner take the vp / Remembre the that whan thou art most gloryous / than haue some men moste enuye on the / and whan thou haste moste seig|nourye and lordships than shalt thou haue moste care. thought and anguysshes / Valpasian was so humble that whan Nero was slayn alle the peple cryed for to haue hym emour / and many of his frendes cam  prayde hym that he wold take hit vpon hym / so at the last he was constrayned to take hit vpon hym / And sayd to his frendes Hit is better and more to preyse and alowe for a man to take thempire agaynst his wil~ / than for to laboure

to haue hit and to put hym self therin / Thus ought they to be humble and meke for to resseyue worship / Ther|fore sayth the bible that Ioab the sone of Saryne that was captayn of the warne of the kynge Dauid / whan he cam to take and wynne a Cyte / He sente to Dauid and desired hym to come to the warre / that the victorye shold be gyuen to Dauid / And not to hym self / Also they ought to be ware that they chaunge not ofte tymes her officers / Iosephus reherceth that the frendes of tybe|ryus meruaylled moche why he helde hys offycyers so longe in theyr offices wyth oute changynge / And they demanded of hym the cause / to whom he answerd / I wold chaunge them gladly / yf I wyste that hit shold be good for the peple / But I sawe on a tyme a man that was royuyous  full of soores / And many flyes satte vpon the soores and souked his blood that hit was mer+uaylle to see / wherfore I suibe and chaced them away. And he than said to me why chacest and smytest away thyse flyes that ben full of my blood / And now shallt then late come other that ben hongrye whiche shall doon to me double payne more than the other dide / for the prikke of the hongrye is more poyngnant the half / than of y^e fulle And therfore sayde he I leue the officiers in their offices. for they ben all~ riche / and doo not so moche euyl~  harme As the newe shold doo  were poure yf I shold sette hem in her places / They ought also to be pacyent in herynge of wordes  in suffrynge payne on her bodyes / as to the first One said to alisander that he was not worthy to regne. specially whan he suffrid that lecherie and delyte to haue seignoire in hym / he suffrid hit paciently / And answerd none otherwyse but that he wolde corrette hym self.

And take better maners and more honeste Also hit is re+herced that Iulius cezar was ballyd wherof he had des|playsir so grete that he kempt his heeris that laye on the after parte of his heed forward for to hyde the bare to fore. Than sayd a knyght to hym Cezar hit is lighther And sonner to be made that thou be not ballid / than that I haue vsid ony cowardyse in the warre of rome / or here after shall doo ony cowardyse / he suffrid hit paciently and sayd not a word / Another reproched hym by his lignage And callyd hym fornier / he answerd that hit is better that noblesse begynne in me / than hit shold faylle in me / Another callid hym tyraunt / he answerd yf I were one. thou woldest not saie soo A knight callid on a tyme scipion of affricque fowle  olde knyght in armes And that he knewe lityll good And he answerd I was born of my moder a lityll child and feble and not a man of armes. And yet he was at alle tymes one of the best and moste worthy in armes that liuyd. Another sayd to vaspasian / And a wolf shold sonner change his skyn and heer / than thou sholdest chau~ge thy lyf For the len|ger thou lyuest the moe thou coueytest And he answerd of thyse wordes we ought to laughe. But we ought to amende our self And punysshe the trespaces. Seneque reherceth that the kynge Antygonus herde certayn peple speke and saye euyll of hym / And therwas betwene hem no more but a courtyne / And than he sayde make an ende of your euyll langage leste the kynge here yow / for the courtyne heereth yow well I nowhe. Than as tow|chynge to the paynes that they ought to suffre paciently Valerius reherceth that a tyrant dide do tormente Ana|maximenes  thretenyd hym for to cutte of his tonge.

To whom he sayd hit is not in thy power to doo soo / and forthwyth he bote of his owne tonge / And shewed hit wyth his teth and casted hit in the visage of the Tyrant Hit is a grete vertu in a man that he forgete not to be pacyent in corrections of wronges / Hit is better to leue a gylty man vnpunysshyd / than to punysshe hym in a wrath or yre Valerius reherceth that archita of tarente that was mayster to plato sawe that his feldes  lande was destroyed and lost by the necligence of his seruant To whom he sayd yf I were not angry with the I wold take vengeance and turmente the / Lo there ye may see that he had leuer to leue to punysshe / than to pugnysshe more by yre  wrath than by right And therfore sayth seneque / doo no thynge that thou oughtest to doo whan y^u art angry / For whan thou art angry thou woldest doo alle thynges after thy playsir / And yf thou canst not va|nquysshe thyn yre / than muste thyn yre ouercome the / Af|ter thys ought they to haue wylfull pouerte / lyke as hit was in the auncyent prynces / For they coueyted more to be riche in wytte and good maners than in moneye / And that reherceth Valerius in his .viii. booke that scipion of Affryque was accused vnto the Senate that he shold haue grete tresour / And he answerd certes whan I sub|mysed affryque in to your poeste / I helde no thynge to my self that I myght saye this is myn saue only the surname of affryque / Ner the affryquans haue not founden in me ner in my broder ony auarice / ner y^t we were so couetouse that we had ne had gretter enuye to be riche of name than of rychesses / And therfore sayth seneque that the kynge Altagone vsid gladly in his hows vessels of erthe / And some sayde he dyde hit for couetyse / But he sayde that

hit was better and more noble thynge to shyne in good maners than in vayssell And whan some men demanded hym why and for what cause he dyde so / he answerd I am now kynge of secylle / and was sone of a potter / and for as moche as I doubte fortune. For whan I yssued out of the hous of my fader and moder / I was sodaynly made riche / wherfore I beholde the natiuyte of me and of my lignage / whiche is humble  meke / And alle these thynges cometh of wilfull pouerte / for he entended more to the comyn prouffyt than to his owen / And of thys pouerte speketh saynt Augustyn in the booke of the cyte of god That they that entende to the comyn prouffyt. sorowe more that wilfull pouerte is lost in rome / than the richesses of rome / For by the wilfull pouerte was the renomce of good maners kept entierly / thus by this richesse pouerte is not only corrupt in thyse dayes ner the cyte ner the maners / but also the thoughtes of the men ben corrupt by thys couetyse and by felonnye that is worse than ony other enemye And of the cruelte of the peple of rome speketh the good man of noble memorye Iohn the monke late cardynall of rome in the decretall the syxte in the chapitre gens sancta where he sayth / that they ben felou~s ayenst god. contrarye to holy thynges. traytres one to that other. enuyous to her neyghbours. proude vn+to straungers. rebelle and vntrewe vnto theyr souerayns Not suffringe to them that ben of lower degree than they and nothinge shamfast to demande thinges discouenable and not to leue tyll they haue that they demande / and not plesid but disagreable whan they haue resseyuyd the yeft They haue their tonges redy for to make grete boost / and doo lityll / They ben large in promysynges / And smale

gyuers / they ben ryght fals deceyuours / And ryght inor|dent and bitynge detractours / For whiche thynge hit is a grete sorowe to see the humylite the pacyence / And the good wisedom that was woute to be in this cyte of rome whiche is chief of alle the world is peruertid torned in to maleheurte and thise euylles / And me thynketh that in other partyes of crestiante they haue taken ensample of them to doo euyll / They may saye that this is after the decretale of seygnourye and disobeysance / that sayth That suche thynges that the souerayns doo / Is lightly and sone taken in ensample of theyr subgets / Also thise vicayres shold be large and liberall / In so moche that suche peple as serue them ben duly payd and guerdoned of her labour / For euery man doth his labour the better and lightlyer whan he seeth that he shall be well payd and rewarded / And we rede that Titus the sone of vas|pasian was so large and so liberall / That he gaf and promysyd somewhat to euery man / And whan hys moste pryuy frendes demanded of hym why he promy|sid more that he myght gyue / he answerd for as moche as hyt apperteyneth not to a prynce that ony man shold departe sorowfull or tryste fro hym / Than hit happend on a day that he gaf ner promysid no thynge to ony man And whan hit was euen and auysed hym self / he sayd to hys frendes / O ye my frendes thys day haue I lost for this day haue I don no good / And also we rede of Iulius Cesar that he neuer saide in alle his lyue to his knyghtes goo oon but allway he sayde come come / For I loue all|way to be in youre companye / And he knewe well that hit was lasse payne  trauayll to the knyghtes whan the prynce is in her companye that loueth hem  co~forted hem

And also we rede of the same Iulius cesar in the booke of truphes of phylosophers / that ther was an Auncyent knyght of his that was in paryll of a caas hangynge to fore the Iuges of rome so he callyd cesar on a tyme and said to hym to fore all men that he shold be his aduocate And cesar deliueryd and assigned to hym a right good aduocate And the knyght sayd to hym O cesar I put no vicaire in my place whan thou were in parill in y^e batayll of assise / But I faught for the. And than he shewed to hym the places of his woundes that he had receyuyd in the batayll And than cam cesar in his propre persone for to be his aduocate  to plete his cause for hym / he wold not haue the name of vnkyndenes / but doubted that men shold saye that he were proude And that he wold not do for them that had seruyd hym They that can not do so moche / as for to be belouyd of her knightes / can not loue the knyghtes And this sufficeth of the rooks.




The thirde tractate of the offices of the comyn peple. The fyrst chapitre is of the office of the labourers and werkemen.
FOr as moche as the Noble persone canne not rewle ne gouerne with oute y^e seruyce and werke of the peple / than hit behoueth to deuyse the ouu|rages and the offices of the werkemen Than I shall be|gynne fyrst at the fyrst pawne / that is in the playe of the chesse / And signefieth a man of the comyn peple on fote For they be all named pietous that is as moche to saye as footemen And than we wyll begynne at the pawne whiche standeth to fore the rooke on the right side of the kinge for as moche as this pawne apperteyneth to serue the vicaire or lieutenant of the kynge and other officers

vnder hym of necessaryes of vitayll / And this maner a peple is figured and ought be maad in the forme  shappe of a man holdynge in his ryght hande a spade or shouell And a rodde in the lifte hand / The spade or shouell is for to delue  labour therwith the erthe / And the rodde is for to dryue  conduyte wyth all the Bestes vnto her pasture also he ought to haue on his gyrdell / a crokyd hachet for to cutte of the supfluytees of the vignes  trees / And we rede in the bible that the first labourer that euer was / was Cayin the firste sone of Adam that was so euyll that he slewe his broder Abel / for as moche as the smoke of his tythes went strayt vnto heuen / And the smoke  fume of the tythes of Cayin wente dounward vpon the erthe And how well that this cause was trewe / yet was ther another cause of enuye that he had vnto his broder / For whan Adam their fder maried them for to multyplie y^e erthe of hys ignye / he wolde not marye ner Ioyne to gy+der the two that were born aones / but gaf vnto cayin her that was born wyth Abel / And to Abel her that was born with cayin / And thus began the nuye that cayin had ayenst abel / For his wyf was fayrer than cayins wyf And for this cause he slough abel with the chekebone of a beste  at that tyme was neuer no maner of yron blody of mannes blood / And abel was y^e first martier in tholde testament / And this cayin dide many other euyl~ thinges whiche I leue / for hit apperteyneth not to my mater / But hit behouet for necessite y^t some shold labour the erthe af+ter y^e synne of adam / for to fore er adam synned / the erthe brought forth fruyt with out labour of handes / but syn he synned hit muste nedes be labourid with y^e handes of men And for as moche as the erthe is moder of alle thynges

And that we were first formed and toke oure begyn|nyng of the erthe / the same wyse at the laste. she shall be the ende vnto alle vs and to alle thynges / And god that formed vs of the erthe hath ordeyned that by the la|boure of men she shold gyue nourysshyng vnto alle that lyueth / and first the labourer of y^e erthe ought to knowe his god that formed and made heuen  erthe of nought And ought to haue loyaulte and trouth in hym self / and despise deth for to entende to his laboure And he ought to gyue thankyngis to hym that made hym And of whom he receyueth alle his goodes temporall / wherof his lyf is susteyned / And also he is bounden to paye the dismes and tythes of alle his thynges And not as Cayin dyde. But as Abell dyde of the beste that he chese out allway for to gyue to god  to plese hym / For they that grucche and be greuyd in that they rendre and gyue to god the tienthes of her goodes / they ought to be aferd and haue drede that they shall falle in necessite And y^t they might be dispoyllyd or robbed by warre or by tempeste that myght falle or happen in the contrey And hit is meruayll though hit so happen For that man that is disagreable vnto god And weneth y^t the multiplynge of his goodes temporell cometh by the vertu of his owne cou~ceyll and his wytte / the whiche is made by the only ordenance of hym that made alle And by the same ordenance is soone taken away fro hym that is disagreable / and hit is reson that whan a man haboundeth by fortune in goodes / And knoweth not god / by whom hit cometh / that to hym come some other fortune by the whiche he may requyre grace and pardon And to knowe his god / And we rede of the kynge Dauid that was first symple  one of the comyn

peple / that whan fortune had enhaunsed and sette hym in grete astate / he lefte and forgate his god / And fyll to aduoultrye and homicyde and other synnes / Than anon his owne sone Absalon assaylled  began to persecute hym And than whan he sawe that fortune was contra|rye to hym / he began to take agayn his vertuous werkis and requyred pardoun and so retorned to god agayn. We rede also of the children of ysrael~ that were nyghe enfamyned in desert and sore hongry  thrusty that they prayd requyred of god for remedy / Anon he changed his wyll  sente to hem manna /  flessh  / And whan they were replenesshid  fatte of the flessh of bestes  of the manna / they made a calf of gold and worshippid hit. Whiche was a grete synne  Inyquyte / For whan they were hongry they knewe god / And whan theyre belyes were fylde  fatted / they forgid ydoles  were ydolatrers After this euery labourer ought to be faythfull  trewe That whan his maystre delyuereth to hym his lande to be laboured / that he take no thinge to hym self but that hym ought to haue  is his / but laboure truly  take cure and charge in the name of his maistre / and do more diligently his maisters labours than his owen / for the lyf of y^e most grete  noble men next god heth in y^e handes of the labou|rers / and thus all craftes  occupacions ben ordeyned not only to suffise to them only / but to the comyn / And so hit happeth ofte tyme that y^e labourer of the erthe vseth grete and boystous metes / and bryngeth to his maister more subtile  more deyntous metes / And valerius reherceth in his .vi. book that ther was a wise  noble maistre y^t was named Anthom that was accused of a caas of aduoul+trye /  as the cause henge to fore the Iuges / his accusers or

denonciatours brought I labourer that closid his land for so moche as they sayde whan his maistre wente to doo the aduoultrye / this same seruant bare the lanterne. wherof Anthonyus was sore abasshyd and doubted that he shold depose agaynst hym But the labourer that was named papirion sayd to his maister that he shold denye his cause hardyly vnto the Iuges For for to be tor|mentid / his cause shold neuer be enpeyrid by hym / ner no+thyng shold yssue out of his mouth wherof he shold be noyed or greuyd And than was the labourer beten and tormentid and brent in many places of his body But he sayd neuer thynge wherof his mayster was hurte or noyed / But the other that accused his maister were pu|nysshid And papiryon was deliuerid of his paynes free and franc / And also telleth valerius that ther was an|other labourer that was named penapion / that seruyd a maister whos name was Themes whiche was of mer|uayllous faith to his maystre For hit befell that certain knyghtes cam to his maisters hows for to slee hym And anone as papiryon knewe hit / he wente in to his maisters chambre And wold not be knowen For he dide on his maisters gowne and his rynge on his fynger / And laye in his bedde And thus put hym self in parill of deth for to respite his maisters lyf / But we see now a dayes many fooles that daigne not to vse groos metes of labourers. And flee the cours clothynge And maners of a seruant Euery wise man a seruant that truly seruyth his maister is free and not bonde / But a foole that is ouer proude is bonde / For the debilite and feblenes of corage that is broken in conscience by pryde Enuye. or by couetyse is ryght seruytude / yet they ought not to doubte to laboure

for feere  drede of deth / no man ought to loue to moche his lyf / For hit is a fowll thynge for a man to reme to the deth for the enemye of his lyf / And a wyse man and a stronge man ought not to flee for his lyf / but to yssue For ther is no man that lyueth / but he must nedes dye. And of this speketh claudyan and sayth that alle thoo thynges that the Ayer goth aboute and enuyronned. And alle thynge that the erthe laboureth / Alle thyngys that ben conteyned wyth in the see Alle thynges that the floodes brynge forth / Alle thynges that ben nourysshid and alle the bestes that ben vnder the heuen shall departe alle from the world / And alle shall goo at his coman|dement / As well Kynges Prynces and alle that the world enuyronned and gooth aboute / Alle shall goo this waye / Than he ought not to doubte for fere of deth. For as well shall dye the ryche as the poure / deth ma|keth alle thynge lyke and putteth alle to an ende / And therof made a noble versifier two versis whiche folowe Forma. genus. mores. sapie~cia. res. et honores / orte+ruant subita sola manent merita / Wherof the english is Beaulte. lignage. maners. wysedom. thynges  honou|res / shal ben deffetid by sodeyn deth / no thynge shal~ abide but the merites / And herof fynde we in Vitas patrum. that ther was an erle a riche  noble man that had a sone onely / and whan this sone was of age to haue knowlech of the lawe / he herde in a sermone that was prechid that deth spareth none / ne riche ne poure / and as well dyeth y^e yonge as the olde / and that the deth ought specially to be doubted for .iii. causes / one was / y^t noman knoweth whan he cometh / and the seconde / ner in what state he taketh a man / And the thirde he wote neuer whither he shall goo.

Therfore eche man shold dispise and flee the world and lyue well and holde hym toward god And whan this yong man herde this thynge / he wente oute of his contrey and fledde vnto a wyldernesse vnto an hermytage / and whan his fader had loste hym he made grete sorowe / and dyde do enquere  seke hym so moche at last he was foun+den in the herimtage / and than his fader cam theder to hym and sayde / dere sone come from thens / thou shalt be after my deth erle and chyef of my lignage / I shall be lost yf thou come not out from thens / And he than that wyste non otherwise to eschewe the yre of his fader bethought hym and sayde / dere fader ther is in your contre and lande a right euyll custome yf hit plese yow to put that away I shall gladly come out of this place and goo with yow The fader was glad and had grete Ioye And demau~ded of hym what hit was And yf he wold telle hym he pro+mysid hym to take hit away and hit shold be left and sette a parte. Than he sayde dere fader ther dyen as well the yong folk in your contrey as the olde / do that away I pray yow / whan his fader herde that he sayde Dere sone that may not be ner noman may put that away but god only / Than answerd the sone to the fader / than wylle I serue hym and dwelle here wyth hym that may do that. And so abode the childe in the hermytage  lyuyd there in good werkes After this hit apperteyneth to a labourer to entende to his laboure and flee ydlenes / And thou oughtest to knowe that Dauid preyseth moche in the sawlter the trewe labourers and sayth / Thou shalt ete the labour of thyn handes and thou art blessid / and he shall do to the good And hit behoueth that the labourer entende to his labour on the werkedayes for to recuyell

and gadre to gyder the fruyt of his labour / And also he ought to reste on the holyday / bothe he and his bestes. And a good labourer ought to norysshe and kepe his bestes / And this is signefied by the rodde that he hath. Whiche is for to lede and dryue them to the pasture / The firste pastour that euer was / was Abel whiche was Iuste and trewe / and offryd to god the bestes vnto his sacrefice / And hym ought he to folowe in craft  maners But no man that vseth the malice of Cayin maye ensue and folowe Abel / And thus hit apperteyneth to the labourer to sette and graffe trees and vygnes / and also to plante and cutte them And so dyde noe whiche was the first that planted the vygne after y^e deluge and flood For as Iosephus reherceth in y^e book of naturell thinges Noe was he that fonde fyrst the vygne / And he fonde hym bitter and wylde / And therfore he toke .iiii. maners of blood / that is to wete the blood of a lyon. the blood of a lamb. the blood of a swyne. and the blood of an ape and medlid them alto geder with the erthe / And than he cutte the vygne / And put this aboute the rootes therof. To thende that the bitternes shold be put away / and that hyt shold be swete / And whan he had dronken of the fruyt of this vygne / hit was so good and mighty that he becam so dronke / that he dispoylled hym in suche wise y^t his pryuy membres might be seen / And his yongest sone chammocqued and skorned hym And whan Noe was awakid  was sobre  fastinge / he assemblid his sones and shewid to them the nature of the vygne and of the wyn / And told to them the cause why y^t he had put the blood of the bestes aboute the roote of the vygne and that they shold knowe well y^t otherwhile by y^e strength of the

wyn men be made as hardy as the lyon and yrous And otherwhile they be made symple  shamefast as a lambe And lecherous as a swyn / And curyous and full of playe as an Ape / For the Ape is of suche nature that whan he seeth one do a thynge he enforceth hym to doo the same / and so doo many whan they ben dronke / they will medle them wyth alle officers  matiers that apperteyne no thynge to them / And whan they ben fastynge  sobre they can scarsely accomplisshe theyr owne thynges And therfore valerian reherceth that of auncyente and in olde tyme women dranke no wyn for as moche as by dron|kenship they myght falle in ony filthe or vilonye And as Ouide sayth / that the wyns otherwhyle apparaylle the corages in suche manere that they ben couenable to alle synnes whiche take away the hertes to doo well / They make the poure riche / as longe as the wyn is in his heed And shortly dronkenshyp is the begynnynge of alle euyllys / And corrompith the body / and destroyed the sowle and mynusshith the goodes temporels / And this suffyseth for the labourer.


The seconde chapitre of the thirde tractate treteth of the forme and maner of the second pawne and of the maner of a smyth.
THe seconde pawne y^t standeth to fore the knyght on the right side of the kynge hath the forme and figure of a man as a smyth and that is reson For hit apperteyneth to y^e knyghtes to haue bridellys sadellys spores and many other thynges made by the handes of smythes and ought to holde an hamer in his right hande. And in his lyfte hande a dolabre and he ought to haue on his gyrdell a trowell For by this is signefied all maner

of werkemen / as goldsmithes. marchallis. smithes of all forges / forgers  makers of monoye  all maner of smy+thes ben signefyed by the hamer / The carpenters ben signe+fyed by the dolabre or squyer / And by the trowell we vnderstande all masons  keruars of stones / tylers / and alle them that make howses castels  tours / And to alle these crafty men hit apperteyneth that they be trewe. Wise and stronge / and hit is nede y^t they haue in hem self faith and loyaulte / For vnto the goldsmythes behoueth gold  siluer And alle other metallys / yren  steel to other / And vnto the carpenters and masons / ben put to theyr edifices the bodyes and goodes of the peple / And also men put in the handes of the maronners body and goodes of the peple / And in the garde and sewerte of them men put body  sowle in the paryls of the see and therfore ought they to be trewe / vnto whom men commytte suche grete charge and so grete thynges vpon her fayth and truste. And therfore sayth the philosopher / he that leseth his fayth and beleue / may lose no gretter ne more thynge. And fayth is a souerayn good and cometh of the good wyll of the herte and of his mynde And for no necessite wyll deceyue no man / And is not corrupt for no mede. Valerius reherceth that Fabius had receyuyd of hany|bal certayn prysoners that he helde of the romayns for a certayn some of money whiche he promysid to paye to the sayd hanyball / And whan he cam vnto the sena|tours of rome and desired to haue y^e money lente for hem They answerd that they wold not paye ner lene / And than fabius sente his sone to rome  made hym to selle his heritage  patrimonye / and sente the money that he ressey+uyd therof vnto hanibal~ / And had leuer  louyd better

to be poure in his contrey of herytage / than of byleue and fayth / But in thyse dayes hit were grete folye to haue suche affiance in moche peple but yf they had ben preuyd afore For oftentymes men truste in them by whom they ben deceyuyd at theyr nede / And it is to wete that these crafty men and werkemen ben souerainly prouffitable vnto the world And wyth oute artificers and werk|men the world myght not be gouerned / And knowe thou verily that alle tho thynges that ben engendrid on the erthe and on the see / ben made and formed for to do prouffit vnto the lignage of man / for man was formed for to haue generacion / that the men myght helpe and prouffit eche other And here in ought we to folowe na|ture / For she shewed to vs that we shold do comyn prouffit one to an other / And y^e first fondement of Iustice is that no man shold noye ne greue other But that they ought doo the comyn prouffit / For men saye in reproche That I see of thyn / I hope hit shall be myn But who is he in thyse dayes that entendeth more to the comyn prouffit than to his owne / Certaynly none / But all way a man ought to haue drede and feere of his owne hows / whan he seeth his neyghbours hous a fyre And therfore ought men gladly helpe the comyn prouffit / for men otherwhile sette not be a lityll fyre And might quenche hit in the be|gynnyng / that afterward makyth a grete blasyng fyre. And fortune hath of no thinge so grete playsir / as for to torne  werke allway / And nature is so noble a thynge that were as she is she wyll susteyne and kepe / but this rewle of nature hath fayllid longe tyme / how well that the decree sayth that alle the thynges that ben ayenst the lawe of nature / ought to be taken away and put a part

And he sayth to fore in the .viii. distinition that the ryght lawe of nature differenceth ofte tymes for custome  sta+tutes establisshid / for by lawe of nature all thinge ought to be comyn to euery man / and this lawe was of old tyme And men wene yet specially y^t the troians kept this lawe And we rede that the multitude of the Troians was one herte and one sowle / And verayly we fynde that in tyme passid the philosophres dyde the same / And also hit is to be supposyd that suche as haue theyr goodes comune  not propre is most acceptable to god / For ellys wold not thise religious men as monkes freris chanons obser|uantes  all other auowe hem  kepe the wilfull pouerte that they ben professid too / For in trouth I haue my self ben conuersant in a religio hous of white freris at gaunt Whiche haue alle thynge in comyn amonge them / and not one richer than an other / in so moche that yf a man gaf to a frere .iii. d or .iiii. d. to praye for hym in his masse / as sone as the masse is doon he deliuerith hit to his ouerest or procuratour in whyche hows ben many vertuous and deuoute freris And yf that lyf were not the beste and the most holiest / holy church wold neuer suffre hit in religion And acordynge therto we rede in plato whiche sayth y^t the cyte is well and Iustely gouernid and ordeyned in the whiche no man maye saye by right. by custome. ne by orde+nance / this is myn / but I say to the certaynly that syn this custome cam forth to say this is myn / And this is thyn / no man thought to preferre the comyn prouffit so moche as his owen / And alle wrkemen ought to be wise  well aduysyd so that they haue none enuye ne none euyll sus|pecion one to an other / for god wylle that our humayne nature be couetous of two thynges / that is of Religion.

And of wysedom / but in this caas ben some often tymes deceyuyd For they take ofte tymes religion and leue wi|sedom And they take wysedom and reffuse religion And none may be vraye and trewe with oute other For hit apperteyneth not to a wyse man to do ony thynge that he may repente hym of hit / And he ought to do no thynge ayenst his wyll / but to do alle thynge nobly. meurely. fermely. and honestly And yf he haue enuye vpon ony. hit is folye For he on whom he hath enuye is more honest and of more hauoir than he whiche is so enuyous / For a man may haue none enuye on an other / but be cause he is more fortunat and hath more grace than hym self / For enuye is a sorowe of corage y^t cometh of dysordynance of the prouffit of another man And knowe thou verily that he that is full of bounte shall neuer haue enuye of an other / But thenuyous man seeth and thynketh alleway that euery man is more noble / And more fortunat that hymself And sayth alleway to hym self / that man wyn|neth more than I / and myn neyghebours haue more plente of bestes / and her thynges multiplye more than myn / and therfore thou oughtest knowe that enuye is the moste grettest dedely synne that is / for she tormenteth hym that hath her wythin hym / wyth oute tormentynge or doyng ony harme to hym / on whome he hath enuye. And an en|uyous man hath no vertue in hym self / for he corrumpeth hym self for as moche as he hateth allway the welthe and vertues of other / and thus ought they to kepe them that they take none euyll suspeco~n For a man naturelly whan his affection hath suspecion in ony man that he we+neth that he doth / hit semeth to hym verily that it is doon. And hit is an euyll thynge for a man to haue suspecion

on hym self / For we rede that dionyse of zecyll a tyrant Was so suspecionous that he had so grete fere and drede For as moche as he was hated of all men / that he putte his frendes oute of theyr offices that they had / And put other strangers in theyr places for to kepe his body / and these suche as were ryght Cruell and felons / And for fere and doubte of the barbours / he made hys doughters to lerne shaue and kembe / And whan they were grete. He wold not they shold vse ony yron to be occupied by them / but to brenne and senge his heeris / and manaced them and durst not truste in them / And in lyke wyse they had none affance in hym And also he dyde do enuyronne the place where he laye wyth grete diches and brode lyke a castell / And he entryd by a drawbrygge whiche closyd after hym / And hys knyghtes laye wyth oute wyth his gardes whiche wacchid and kept straytly thys forteresse / And whan plato sawe thys Dionyse kynge of cezille thus enuyronned and set aboute wyth gardes  wacchemen for the cause of his suspecion sayd to hym openly to fore all men kinge why hast thou don so moche euyll  harme / that the behoneth to be kept wyth so moche peple / And therfor I saye that hit apperteyneth not to ony man that wylle truly behaue hym self in his werkis to be suspecyous / And also they ought to be stronge and seure in theyr werkes / And specyally they that ben maysters and maronners on the see / for yf they be tumerous and erdfull they shold make a ferde them that ben in theyr shippis / that knowe not the paryls / And so hit might happene that by that drede and fere alle men shold leue theyr labour / And so they myght be perisshid and despeyred in theyr corages / For a shippe is soone

perisshid and lost by a lityll tempest / whan the gouer|nour faylleth to gouerne his shippe for drede / And can gyue no counceyll to other than it is no meruayll / thaugh they be a ferd that ben in his gouernance / And therfore ought be in them strengthe force and corage / and ought to considere the peryls that might falle / And the gouer|nour specially ought not to doubte / And yf hit happen that ony paryll falle / he ought to promyse to the other good hoope / And hit apperteyneth well / that a man of good and hardy corage be sette in that office / In suche wyse that he haue ferme and seure mynde ayenst the pa|ryls that oftetymes happen in the see / and with this ought the maroners haue good and ferme creance and beleue in god / and to be of good reconforte  of fayr langage vnto them that he gouerneth in suche paryls / And this sufficeth to yow as touchynge the labourers.


The thirde chapitre of the thirde book treteth of the office of notaryes aduocats skryueners and drapers or clothmakers.
THe thirde pawne whiche is sette to fore the Al|phyn on the right side ought to be figured as a clerk And hit is reson that he shold so be / For as moche as amonge y^e comon peple of whom we speke in thys book they plete the differencis contencions and causes otherwhile the whiche behoueth the Alphins to gyue sentence and Iuge as Iuges And hit is reson that the Alphin or Iuge haue his notarye / by whom y^e processe may be wreton / And this pawne ought to be made and figured in this mamere / he muste be made like a man that holdeth in his right hand a pair of sheres or forcetis / and in the lifte hand a grete knyf and on his gurdell a penuer

and an yukhorn / and on his ere a penne to wryte wyth And that ben the Instrumentis  the offices that ben made and put in writynge autentyque / and ought to haue passed to fore the Iuges as libelles writtes condempnacions and sentences / And that is signefied by the scriptoire and the penne and on that other part hit appertayneth to them to cutte cloth. shere. dighte. and dye / and that is signefied by the forcettis or sheres / and the other ought to shaue berdes and kembe the heeris / And the other ben coupers. coryers. twiers. skynners. bouchers and cordwanners / and these ben signefyed by the knyf that he holdeth in his hand and some of thise forsayd crafty men ben named drapers or clothmakers for so moche as they werke wyth wolle. and the Notayres. skynners. coryours. and cardewaners werke by skynnys and hydes As parchemyn velume. pel+trye and cordewan / And the Tayllours. cutters of cloth. euars. fullars. dyers / And many other craftes ocupye and vse wulle / And alle thyse crafty men  many other that I haue not named / ought to doo theyr craft and mes+tyer / where as they ben duly ordeyned Curyously and truly / Also ther ought to be amonge thyse crafty men amyable companye and trewe / honest contenance / And trouthe in their wordes / And hit is to wete that the nota+ries ben right prouffitable and ought to be good  trewe for the comyn And they ought to kepe them fro appropri|ynge to them self that thynge y^t apperteyneth to the comyn And yf they be good to them self / they ben good to other. And yf they be euyll for them self / they ben euyll for other And the processes that ben made to fore the Iuges ought to ben wreton  passid by them / and hit is to wete that by their writynge in the processis may come moche prouffit

And also yf they wryte otherwyse than they ought to doo / may ensewe moche harme and domage to the comyn Therfore ought they to take good heede that they chau~ge not ne corrumpe in no wyse the content of the sentence. For than ben they first forsworn And ben bounden to make amendes to them that by theyr tricherye they haue endomaged / And also ought they to rede visite and to knowe the statutes. ordenances and the lawes of the cy+tees of the contre / where they dwelle and enhabite / And they ought to considere yf ther be ony thynge therin contey+ned ayenst right and reson / and yf they fynde ony thinge contraire / they ought to admoneste and warne them that gouerne / that suche thynges may be chau~ged into better astate / For custome establisshid ayenst good maners and agaynst the fayth / ought not to be holden by right. For as hit is sayd in the decree in the chapitre to fore / alle ordenance made ayenst ryght ought to be holden for nought Alas who is now that aduocate or notaire that hath charge to wryte and kepe sentence that putteth his entente to kepe more the comyn prouffit or as moche as his owen / But alle drede of god is put a back / and they deceyue the symple men And drawen them to the courtes disordinatly and constrayned them to swere and make othes not couenable / And in assemblyng the peple thus to gyder they make moo traysons in the cytees than they make good alyances And otherwhile they deceyue their souerayns / whan they may doo hit couertly For ther is no thynge at this day that so moche greueth rome and Italye as doth the college of notaries and aduocates pub+licque / For they ben not of oon a corde / Alas and in Eugeland what hurte doon the aduocats. men of lawe.

And attorneyes of court to the comyn peple of y^e royame as well in the spirituell lawe as in the temporall / how torne they the lawe and statutes at their pleasir / how ete they the peple / how enpouere they the comynte / I suppose that in alle Cristendom ar not so many pletars attorneys and men of the lawe as ben in englond onely / for yf they were nombrid all that lange to the courtes of the chann|cery kinges benche. comyn place. cheker. ressayt and helle And the bagge berars of the same / hit shold amounte to a grete multitude And how alle thyse lyue  of whome. yf hit shold be vttrid told / hit shold not be byleuyd. For they entende to theyr synguler wele and prouffyt and not to the comyn / how well they ought to be of good wyll to gyder / and admoneste and warne the cytes eche in his right in suche wise that they myght haue pees and loue one with an other And tullius saith that frendshippe and good wyll that one ought to haue ayenst an other for the wele of hym that he loueth / wyth the semblable wylle of hym / ought to be put forth to fore alle other thynges / And ther is no thynge so resemblynge and lyke to the bees that maken honye ne so couenable in prosperite and in aduersite as is loue / For by loue gladly the bees holden them to gyder / And yf ony trespace to that other anone they renne vpon the malefactour for to punysshe hym / And verray trewe loue faylleth neuer for wele ne for euyll / and the most swete and the most confortynge thynge is for to haue a frende to whom a man may saye his secrete / as well as to hym self / But verayly amytye and frendship is somtyme founded vpon som thinge delec+table And this amytye cometh of yongthe / in the whiche dwelleth a disordinate heete.
And otherwhile amytie is founded vpon honeste / And this amytie is vertuouse / Of the whiche tullius saith y^t ther is an amytie vertuous by the whiche a man ought to do to his frende alle that he requyreth by rayson For for to do to hym a thynge dishonneste it is ayenst the nature of verray frendshipe  amytie / And thus for frendshipe ne for fauour a man ought not to doo ony thinge vnreso|nable ayenst the comyn prouffit ner agaynst his fayth ne ayenst his oth / for yf alle tho thynges that the frendes desire and requyre were accomplisshid  doon / hit shold seme that they shold be dishoneste coniuracions / And they myght otherwhile more greue  hurte than prouffit and ayde / And herof sayth seneque that amytie is of suche wylle as the frende wylle / And to reffuse that ought to be reffusid by rayson / And yet he sayth more. that a man ought to alowe and preyse his frende to fore the peple / and to correcte and to chastyse hym pryuyly. For the lawe of amytie is suche. For a man ought not to demande ner doo to be doon to his frende no vyllayns thynge that ought to be kept secrete And valerian sayth that it is a fowll thynge and an euyll excusacion / yf a man conffesse that he hath done ony euyll for his frende ayenst right and rayson / And sayth that ther was a good man named Tassile whiche herde one his frende repuyre of hym a thynge dishonneste whiche he denyed and wold not doo And than his frende sayth to hym in grete dispyte / what nede haue I of thy frendship  amytie whan thou wylt not doo that thynge that I requyre of the And Tassile answerd to hym / what nede haue I of the frendship and of the amytie of the / yf I shold doo for the thynge dishoneste And thus loue is founded otherwhile

vpon  prouffitable / and this loue endureth as longe as he seeth his prouffit And herof men saye a comyn pro+uerbe in england / that loue lasteth as longe as the money endureth / and whan the money faylleth than there is no loue / and varro reherceth in his sommes / that y^e riche men ben alle louyd by this loue / for their frendes ben lyke as y^e huske whiche is aboute the grayn / and no man may proue his frende so well as in aduersite / or whan he is poure / for the veray trewe frende faylleth at no nede / And seneque saith y^t some folowe the emour for riches / and so doon y^e fes the hony for the swetenes / and the wolf the karayn And thise companye folowe the proye / and not the man And tullius saith that Tarquyn y^e proude had a neuewe of his suster which was named brutus and this neuewe had banysshid tarquyn out of rome and had sente hym in exyle / And than sayd he first that he parceyuyd  knewe his frendes whiche were trewe  vntrewe / and y^t he neuer perceyuyd a fore tyme whan he was puyssant for to doo their wyll / and sayd well that the loue that they had to hym / endured not but as longe as it was to them prouffi+table / and therfore ought all the ryche men of the world take hede / be they Kynges Prynces or dus to what peple they doo prouffit  how they may and ought be louyd of theyr peple / For cathon sayth in his book / see to whom thougyuyst / and this loue whiche is founded vpon theyr prouffit / whiche faylleth and endureth not / may better be callyd and said marchandyse than loue / For yf we repute this loue to our prouffit only / and nothynge to the prouffyt of hym that we loue / It is more marchandyse than loue / For he byeth our loue for the prouffit that he doth to vs / and therfor saith the versifier thise two versis

Tempore felici multi murmerantur amici Cum ina perit nullus amicus erit / whiche is to saye in English that as longe as a man is ewrous and fortunat he hath many frendes but whan fortune torneth and perisshith. ther abideth not to hym one frende / And of this loue ben louyd the medowes. feldes. Trees and the bestes for the prouffit that men take of them / But the loue of the men ought to be charyte. veray gracious and pure by good fayth / And the veray trewe frendes ben knowen in pure aduersite / and pers alphons saith in his book of moralite that ther was a philosophre in arabye that had an onely sone / of whom he demanded what frendes he had goten hym in his lyf And he answerd that he had many And his fader sayd to hym / I am an olde man / And yet coude I neuer fynde but one frende in alle my lyf / And I trowe verily that it is no lytyll thynge for to haue a frende / and hit is well gretter and more a man to haue many / And hit appertayneth and behoueth a man to assaye and preue his frende er he haue nede And than comanded the philo|sopher his sone / that he shold goo and slee a swyne / and putte hit in a sack / and fayne that hit were a man dede that he had slayn and bere hit to his frendes for to burye hit secretly / And whan the sone had don as his fader co|manded to hym and had requyred his frendes one after an other as a fore is sayd / They deuyed hym / And ans|werd to hym that he was a vylayne to requyre  desire of them thynge that was so peryllous And than he cam agayn to his fader and sayd to hym how he had requy|red alle his frendes / And that he had not founden one that wolde helpe hym in his nede And than his fader said to hym that he shold goo and requyre his frende whiche

had but one / and requyre hym that he shold helpe hym in his nede And whan he had requyred hym / Anone he put oute alle his mayne oute of his hows / And whan they were oute of the waye or a slepe he dide do make secretly a pytte in the grounde / And whan hyt was redy and wold haue buryed the body / he fonde hit an hogge or a swyne and not a man / And thus thys sone preu~yd thys man to be a veray trewe frende of his fader / And preuyd that his frendes were fals frendes of fortune / And yet reherceth the sayd piers Alphons / That ther were two marchantes one of Bandach and that other of Egipte whiche were so Ioyned to gyder by so grete frendshippe that he of Bandach cam on a tyme for to see hys frende in Egipte / of whom he was receyuyd ryght honourably And thy marchant of Egipte had in his hows a fayr yonge mayden whom he shold haue had in maryage to hymself / Of the whiche mayde thys marchant of Ban+dach was esprysed wyth her loue so ardantly that he was ryght seeke / And that men supposid hym to dye. And than the other dyde doo come the phisicyens whiche sayd that in hym was none other sekenes sauf passyon of loue / Than he axid of the seeke man yf ther were ony woman in hys hows that he louyd and made alle the women of his hows to come to fore hym / And than he chees her that shold haue ben that others wyf and sayd that he was seek for the loue of her / Than hys frende sayd to hym Frende conforte your self / For trewly I gyue her to yow to wyf wyth alle the dowayre that is gyuen to me wyth her / And had leuer to suffre to be wyth oute wyf than to lese the body of his frende. And than he of Bandach wedded the mayde.

And wente wyth his wyf and wyth his richesse ayen in to his contrey And after this anone after hit happend that the marchau~t of Egipte be cam so poure by euyll for+tune / that he was constrayned to seche and begge his brede by the contrey in so moche that he cam to bandach. And whan he entrid in to the toun hit was derke nyght that he coude not fynde the hows of his frende / but wente and laye this nyght in an olde temple / And on the morn whan he shold yssue oute of the temple / the officers of the toun arestid hym and sayd that he was an homycide and had slayn a man whiche laye there dede And ano~n he confessid hit wyth a good wylle / And had leuyr to ben hangid / than to dye in that myserable and poure lyf that he suffrid And thus whan he was brought to Iuge+ment And sentence shold haue ben gyuen ayenst hym as an homicide / his frende of bandach cam and sawe hym and anone knewe y^t this was his good frende of Egipte And forthwyth stept in and sayde that he hym self was culpable of the deth of this man / and not that other / and enforced hym in alle maners for to delyuer and excuse that other / And than whan that he that had don the feet and had slayn the man sawe this thynge / he considerid in hym self that these two men were Innocente. of this feet / And doubtynge the dyuyn Iugement he cam to fore the Iuge and confessid alle the feet by ordre / And whan the Iuge sawe and herd alle this mater / and also the causes he considerid the ferme and trewe loue that was betwene the two frendes And vnderstode the cause why that one wold saue that other / and the trouth of the fayte of the homicide And than he pardoned alle the feet hoolly and entierly / and after the marchant of bandach

brought hym of egipte wyth hym in to his hous / and gaf to hym his suster in mariage / and departid to hym half his goodes / And so bothe of hem were riche / And thus were they bothe veray faythfull and trewe frendes / Further|more Notaires. men of lawe and crafty men shold and ought to loue eche other And also ought to be contynent chaste  honeste / For by theyr craftes they ought so to be by necessite / For they conuerse  accompanye them ofte tyme with women And therfor hit apperteyneth to them to be chaste and honeste And that they meue not the wo+men ner entyse them to law he / and Iape by ony disordi|nate ensignees or tokens / Titus liuys reherceth that the philosopher democreon dyde do put oute his eyen for as moche as he myght not beholde the women wyth oute flesshely desire / And how well hit is said before that he dide hit for other certayn cause yet was this one of the pryncipall causes / And Valerian telleth that ther was a yonge man of rome of ryght excellent beaute / And how well that he was ryght chaste / For as moche as his beaute meuyd many women to desyre hym / in so moche that he vnderstode that the parents and frendes of them had suspecion in hym / he dyde his visage to be cutte wyth a knyf and lancettis endlonge and ouerthwart for to deforme his visage / And had leuer haue a fowle visage and disformed / than the beaute of hys visage shold meue other to synne / And also we rede that ther was a Nonne a virgyne dyde do put oute bothe her eyen For as moche as the beaute of her eyen meuyd a kynge to loue her / whyche eyen she sente to the kynge in a pre|sente / And also we rede that plato the ryght ryche and wyse phylosophre lefte hys owne lande and Contre.

And cheese his mansion and dwellynge in a chadomye a town / whiche was not only destroyed but also was full of pestelence / so that by the cure and charge and cus+tomance of sorowe that he there suffrid / myght eschewe the heetes and occasions of lecherye / And many of his disciples dyde in lyke wyse / Helemand reherceth that de|mostenes the philosopher lay ones by a right noble wo|man for his disporte / and playnge with her he demanded of her what he shold gyue to haue to doo wyth her / And she answerd to hym / a thousand pens / and he sayd agayn to her I shold repente me to bye hit so dere / And whan he aduysed hym that he was so sore chauffid to speke to her for tacco~plssh his flesshely desire / he dispoyl|led hym alle naked and wente and putte hym in the mid+des of the snowe And ouide reherceth that this thynge is the leste that maye helpe and moste greue the louers And therfore saynt Augustyn reherceth in his book de Ciuita|di that ther was a ryght noble romayne named mercu|ian that wan and toke the noble cyte of siracuse And to fore er he dyde do assaylle hit or befyghte hit / and er he had do be shedde ony blood / he wepte and shedde many treris to fore the cyte And that was for the cause that he doubted that his peple shold defoyle and corrumpe to moche dishonestly the chastyte of the toun And ordeyned vpon payne of deth that no man shold be so hardy to take and defoylle ony woman by force what that euer she were / After this the craftymen ought to vnderstond for to be trewe / and to haue trouthe in her mouthes And that theyr dedes folowe theyr wordes For he that sayth one thynge and doth another / he condempneth hym self by his word Also they ought to see well to that they be of one

Acorde in good. by entente. by word. and by dede / so that they ben not discordant in no caas / But euery man haue pure veryte and trouth in hym self / For god hym self is pure verite / And men saye comynly that trouthe seketh none hernes ne corners / And trouthe is a vertu by the whyche alle drede and fraude is put away / Men saye truly whan they saye that they knowe / And they that knowe not trouthe / ought to knowe hit / And alleway vse trouthe / For Saynt Austyn sayth that they that wene to knowe trouthe / And lyuyth euyll  viciously It is folye yf he knoweth hit not / And also he sayth in an other place that is better to suffre peyne for trouthe. Than for to haue a benefete by flsenes or by flaterye. And man hat is callyd a beste resonable and doth not his werkes after reson and trouthe / Is more bestyall than ony beste brute / And knowe ye that for to come to the trouthe / Hit cometh of a raysonable forsight in his mynde / And lyenge cometh of an outrageous and ntrarye thought in his mynde / For he that lyeth we|tyngly / Knoweth well that hit is agaynst the trouthe that he thynketh / And herof speketh Saynt Bernard and sayth / That the mouthe that lyeth destroyeth the sowle / And yet sayth Saynt Austyn in an other place For to saye ony thynge / And to doo the contrarye. maketh doctryne suspecious / And knowe ye veryly that for to lye is a right perillous thynge to body and sowle For the lye that the auncyent enemye made Eue  adam to beleue hym / made hem for to be dampned wyth alle theyr lignage to the deth pardurable And made hem to be cast oute of Paradyse terrestre / For he made them to beleue that god had not forboden them the fruyt.

But only be cause they shold not knowe that her maister knewe But how well that the deuyll said thise wordes yet had she double entente to hem bothe For they knewe ano~n as they had tasted of the fruyt that they were damp+ned to the deth pardurable / And god knewe hit well to fore But they supposid well to haue knowen many other thynges And to be lyke vnto his knowleche and science And therfore sayth saynt poule in a pistyll / hit ne apperteyneth to saure or knowe more than behoueth to saure or knowe / but to sauoure or knowe by mesure or sobrenes / And valerian reherceth that ther was a good woman of siracusane that wold not lye vnto the kynge of secylle whiche was named dyonyse And this kynge was so full of tyrannye  so cruell that alle the world desired his deth and cursid hym / Saauf this woman onely whiche was so olde that she had seen thre or .iiii. kynges regnynge in the contre / And euery mornynge as sone as she was rysen she prayd to god that he wold gyue vnto the tyrant good lyf and longe And that she myght neuer see his deth / And whan the kynge dyonise knewe this he sent for her And meruayllid moche herof For he knewe well that he was sore behated / And de|maunded her / what cause meuyd her to pray for hym. And she answerd and said to hym Syre whan I was a mayde we had a right euyll tyrant to our kynge of whom we coueyted sore the deth And whan he was ded ther cam after hym a worse / of whom we coueyted also the deth / And whan we were deliueryd of hym / thou camst to be our lord whiche art worste of alle other. And now I doubte yf we haue one after the he shall be worse than thou art / And therfore I shall pray for the

And whan dionyse vnderstod that she was so hardy in sayynge the truthe / he durste not doo tormente her for shame be cause she was so olde.


The fourth chapitre of the thirde book treteth of the maner of the fourth pawn and of the marchants or changers.
THe fourth pawn is sette to for the kynge And is formed in the fourme of a man holding in his ryght hand a balance / And the weyght in the lifte hand / And to fore hym a table And at his gurdell a purse fulle of monoye redy for to gyue to them that re+quyre hit And by this peple ben signefied the marchans of cloth lynnen and wollen  of all other marchandises And by the table that is to for hym is signefied y^e chan+geurs / And they that leue money / And they that bye  selle by the weyght ben signefyed by the balances and weight And the customers / ollers / and resseyuours of rentes  of money ben signefied by the purse And knowe ye that alle they that ben signefied by this peple ought to lee auaryce and couetyse / And eschewe brekynge of the dayes of payement / And ought to holde and kepe theyr promyssis / And ought also to rendre  restore y^ / that is gyuen to them to kepe / And therfor hit is reson that this peple be sette to for y^e kynge for as moche as they signefie the resscyuours of the tresours royall that ought allway to be redy to fore y^e kynge and to answere for hym to the knightes and other persones for their wages  souldyes And therfor haue I sayd that they ought to flee auarice. For auarice is as moche to say as an adourer or as wor+shipar of fals ymages /  herof saith Tullius that auarice is a couetise to gete y^t thing that is aboue necessite /  it is a

loue disordinate to haue ony thynge And it is one of the werst thyngis that is And specially to prynces and to them that gouerne the thynges of the comunete And this vice causeth a man to do euyll / And this doynge euyll is whan hit regneth in olde men And herof saith Seneque That alle wordly thynges ben mortifyed and appetissid in olde men reserued auaryce only / whiche alleway abi|deth wyth hym and dyeth wyth hym But I vnderstande not well the cause wherof this cometh ne wherfore hit may be And hit is a fowle thynge and contrarie to reson That whan a man is at ende of his Iourney for to lengthe his viage and to ordeyne more vitayll than hym behoueth And this may well be lykened to the auarycious wolf For the wolf doth neuer good tyll he be dede And thus it is sayd in the prouerbis of the wisemen / that thauari|cious man doth no good tyll that he be ded / And he desi|reth no thynge but to lyue longe in this synne For the co|uetouse man certaynly is not good for ony thynge For he is euyll to hymself and to the riche and to the poure. And fynde cause to gayn saye theyr desire / and herof reher|ceth seneque and sayt that Antigonus was a couetous prynce /  whan Tinque whiche was his frende requy+red of hym a besau~t / he answerd to hym that he deman|ded more than hit apperteyned to hym And than tinque constrayned by grete necessite axid and requyred of hym a peny / And he answerd to hym that hit was no yefte couenable for a kynge and so he was allway redy to fynde a cause nought to gyue For he myght haue gyuen to hym a besau~t as a kynge to his frende / And the peny as to a poure man And ther is no thynge so lytyll / but that the humanyte of a kynge may gyue hit Auarice full

of couetyse is a maner of alle vices of luxurye And Iose+phus reherceth in the book of auncyent histories / that ther was in rome  ryght noble lady named Paulyne / And was of the most noble of rome / right honeste for the no|blesse of chastete / whiche was maryed in the tyme that the women gloryfied them in theyr chastete vnto a yonge man fayr. noble. and riche aboue alle other / and was lyke and semblable to his wyf in alle caasis / And this paulyne was belouyd of a knight named emmerancian And was so ardautly esprysed in her loue that he sente to her many right riche yeftes / And made to her many grete promissis / but he might neuer tne the herte of her whiche was on her side also colde and harde as marbill But had leuer to reffuse his yeftes and his promisses. Than to entende to couetise  to lose her chastete / and we ede also in the historyes of rome that ther was a noble lady of rome / whiche lyuyd a solitarye lyf and was chaste  honeste / And had gadrid to gyder a grete some of gold / And had hid hit in the erthe in a pytte wyth in her hous / And whan she was ded / the bisshop dyde do burye her in the churche well and honestly / And anone after this gold was founden  born to the bisshop / And the bisshop bad to caste hit in to the pytte wher she was buryed / And .iii. dayes men herd her crye  make grete noyse / and saye that she brennyd in grete payne / and they herd her ofte tymes thus tormentid in y^e chirche / the neigh+bours wente to the bisshop  told hym therof / and y^e bis+shop gaf hem leue to open the sepulcre / and whan they had opend hit / they fonde all the gold molten with fyre full of sulphre / And was poured and put in her mouth / and they herd one saye / thou desiredest this gold by couetyse

take hit and drynke hit / And than they toke the body out of the tombe And hit was cast oute in a preuy place Seneque reherceth in the book of the cryes of women that auarice is foundement of alle vices / And valerian reherceth that auarice is a ferdfull garde or kepar of ry|chessis for he that hath on hym or in his kepynge moche money or other rychessis / is allway a ferd to lose hit or to be robbid or to be slayn therfore / And he is not ewrous ner happy that by couetyse geteth hit / And alle the euyllys of this vice of auarice had a man of rome na|med septemulle For he was a frende of one named tar|chus And this septemulle brente so sore and so cruelly in this synne of couetyse / that he had no shame to smyte of the hede of his frende by trayson / For as moche as one framosian had promysed to hym as moche weyght of pure gold as the heed weyed And he bare the sayd heed vpon a staf thurgh the cyte of rome / and he wyded the brayn out therof and fyld hit full of leed for to weye the heuyer This was a right horrible and cruell auarice Ptolome kynge of the Egipciens poursewed auarice in an other manere For whan anthome emperour of rome sawe that he was right riche of gold and siluer / he had hym in grete hate and tormentid hym right cruelly And whan he shold perishe be cause of his richessis / he toke alle his hauoyr and put hit in a shippe And wente wyth alle in to the hye see to thende for to drowne and perishe there the shippe and his rychesses be cause Anthonie his enemye shold not haue hit / And whan he was there he durst not perisshe hit ner myght not fynde in his herte to departe from hit / but cam and brought hit agayn in to his hows where he resseyuyd the reward of deth therfore.

And wyth oute doubte he was not lord of the richesse but the richesse was lady ouer hym / And therfore hit is sayd in prouerbe that a man ought to signorye ouer the riches / and not for to serue hit / and yf thou canst dewly vse thy rychesse than she is thy chamberyer / And yf thou can not departe from hit and vse hit honestly at thy playsir / knowe verily y^t she is thy lady For the richesse neuer satisfieth the couetouse / but the more he hath / the more he desireth / And saluste sayth that auarice distour|blith fayth poeste honeste and alle these other good ver|tues / And taketh for these vertues pryde. cruelte. And to forgete god / And saith that alle thynges be vendable And after this they ought to be ware that they lene not to moche / ner make so grete creances by which they may flle in pouerte / For saynt Ambrose saith vpon to bye. pouerte hath no lawe for to owe hit is a shame /  to owe and not paye is a more shame / yf y^u be poure beware how thou berowest / and thinke how thou maist paye  rendre agayn yf y^u be ryche y^u hast none nede to borowe  axe /  it is said in the prouerbes y^t hit is fraude to take / that y^u wilt not ner maist rendre  paye agayn / and also hit is said in reproche / whan I leue I am thy frend /  whan I axe I am thy enemye / as wo saith / god at the leyge /  the deuyll at rendrynge / And seneque sayth in his auctorites / that they y^t gladly borowe / ought gladly to paye / and ought to surmonte in corage to loue hem the better be cause they lene hem  ayde hem in her nede For for benefetes  good tornes doon to a man ought to gyue hym thankinges ther+fore / And moche more ought a man to repaye that Is lente hym in his nede / But now in these dayes many men by lenynge of their money haue made of their frendes

enemyes / And herof speketh Domas the philosopher and sayth that my frende borowed money of me / And I haue lost my frende and my money attones / Ther was a marchant of Gene  also a chaungeour / whos name was Albert gauor / And this albert was a man of grete trouth and loyaulte / for on a tyme ther was a man cam to hym and said affermed that he had delyueryd in to his banke .v. honderd floryns of gold to kepe whiche was not trouth for he lyed / whyche fyue honderd flo+ryns the said Albert knewe not of / ner coude fynde in all hys bookes ony suche money to hym due And this lyar coude not brynge no wytnessis / but began to braye. crye and deffame the said albert And than this Albert callid to hym this marchau~t and sayd / Dere frende take here v honderd florms whyche thou affermest and sayst that thou hast deliuerid to me And forthwyth tolde hem and toke hem to hym And lo this good man had leuer to lose his good than his good name and renome And this other marchant toke these florins that he had wrong|fully receyuyd / and enployed them in diuerce marchan|dise in so moche that he gate and encresid and wan with them .xv. thousand florins And whan he sawe that he approchid toward his deth / and that he had no children He establisshid albert his heyr in alle thingis And sayd that with the .v. honderd florms that he had receyuyd of albert falsely / he had goten alle y^t he had in the world And thus by dyuyne pourueance he that had be a theef fraudelent / was made afterward a trewe procurour and attorney of the sayd albert / But now in this dayes ther ben marchau~s that do marchandise with other mens money whiche is taken to hem to kepe / And whan they

ben requyred to repaye hit they haue no shame to denye hit appertly / wherof hit happend that ther was a mar+chant whyche had a good  a grete name and renome of kepynge well suche thynges as was delyueryd to hym to kepe / But whan he sawe place and tyme / he reteynyd hyt lyke a theef / So hyt befelle that a mar|chant of with oute forth herd the good reporte  fame of this man / cam to hym and deliuerid hym grete tresour to kepe / And this tresour abode thre yer in his kepynge. And after this thre yer thys marchant cam  requyred to haue hys good deliueryd to hym agaym / And thys man knewe well that he had no recorde ne wytnes to preue on hym this duete / Nor he had no obligacion ne wrytynge of hym therof / In suche wyse that he denyed alle entyerly / And sayd playnly he knewe hym not. And whan thys good man herde and vnderstode thys. he wente sorowfully and wepynge from hym so ferre and longe that an old woman mette wyth hym / And demanded of hym the cause of hys wepynge / And he sayd to her / woman hit apperteyneth no thynge to the Go thy way / And she prayd hym that he wold telle her the cause of hys sorowe / For parauenture she myght gyue hym counceylle good and prouffytable. And than this man told to her by ordre the aas of his fortune / And the old woman that was wyse  sub+tyll demanded of hym yf he had in that cyte ony frende whiche wold be faythfull and trewe to hym And he sayd ye that he had dyuerce frendes / Than said she goo thou to them and saye to them that they do ordeyne and bye dyuerce cofres  chestie / And that they do fylle them with som olde thinges of no value / and that they fayne

And saye that they be full of gold. siluer  other Iewels and of moche grete tresour / And than that they brynge them to this sayd marchant And to saye to hym that he wold kepe them / For as moche as they had grete trust and affiance in hym And also that they haue herd of his grete trouthe and good renome / And also they wold goo in to a fer contre And shold be longe er they retorned agayn And whilis they speke to hym of this mater / thou shalt come vpon them and requyre hym that he do deliuere to the / that thou tokest to hym / And I trowe be cause of tho good men that than shall profre to hym the sayd tre|sour / And for the couetise to haue hit / he shall deliuere to the thy good agayn / But beware late hym not knowe in no wyse that they ben thy frendes ner of thy knowleche This was a grete and good cou~ceyll of a woman And verily hit cometh of nature oftentymes to women to gyue counceyll shortly and vnauysedly to thynges that ben in doute or perillous and nedeth hasty remedye / And as ye haue herd / this good man dyde And dyde after her coun|ceyll And cam vpon them whan they spack of the mater to the marchant for to deliuere to hym the sayd cofres to kepe whyche his frendes had fayned and requyred of hym that he had taken to hym to kepe / and than ano~n the sayd marchant sayd to hym I knowe the now well. For I haue auysed me that thou art suche a man / And camst to me suche a tyme / And deliuerest to me suche a thynge whiche I haue well kept / And than callyd his clerck / and bad hym goo fecche suche a thynge in suche a place / and deliuere hit to that good man For he deliuerid hit to me / And than the good man receyuyd his good. And wente his way right Ioyously and gladd / And

this marchant trycheur and deceyuour was defrauded from his euyll malice / And he ne had neyther that one ne that other ony thynge that was of value / And ther|fore hit Is sayd in prouerbe to defraude the beguylar is no fraude / And he that doth well foloweth oure lord And seneke saith that charyte enseygneth and techeth that men shold paye well For good payement is some|tyme good confession / And this marchant trycheour  deceyuour resembleth  Is lyke to an hound that bereth a chese in his mouth whan he swymmeth ouer a watre For whan he is on the watre He seeth the shadowe of the chese in the watre / And than he weneth hit be an other chese / And for couetyse to haue that / he openth his mouth to cacche that / And than the chese that he bare fallyth doun in to the watre / And thus he loseth bothe two / And in the same wise was seruyd this marchant deceynour / For for to haue the coffres / whiche he had not seen / He deliueryd agayn that he wold haue holden wrongfully  thus by his couetise and propre malice he was deceyuyd / And therfore hit apperteyneth to euery good  wyse man to knowe  considere in hym self how moche he had resseyuyd of other men / And vpon what condicion hit was deliuerid to hym And hit is to wete y^t this thinge apperteyneth to resseyuours  to chaungeours And to alle true marchans and other what som euyr they bee / and ought to kepe their bookes of resaytes  of payements of whom  to whom and what tyme  day. and yf ye demande what thynge makyth them to forgete suche thynges as ben taken to them to kepe I answere  saye that hyt Is grete couetyse for to haue tho thynges to them self and neuer to departe from them / And hit is all

her thought and desire to assemble alle the good that they may gete For they beleue on none other god / but on her richessis theyr hertes ben so obstynat / and this sufficeth of the marchantes.


This fyfth chapitre of the thirde book treteth of phisi|ciens spicers and Apotyquaryes.
THe pawo~n that is sette to fore the quene signe|fyeth the phisicyen / spicer and Apotyquaire / and
is formed in the figure of a man / And he is sette in a chayer as a maystre and holdeth in his right hand a book / And an ample or a boxe wyth oynementis in his lyft hand / And at his gurdell his Instrumentis of yron and of siluer for to make Incysions and to serche woun+des and hurtes / and to cutte apostumes / And by thyse thynges ben knowen the cyrurgyens / By the book ben vnderstanden the phisicyens / and alle gramaryens. logi|cyens / maistres of lawe. of Geometrye. Arismetryque. musique and of astronomye / And by the ampole / ben signefyed the makers of pigmentaries spicers and apoti+quayres / and they that make confections and confytes and medecynes made wyth precyous spyces And by the ferremens and Instrumentis that hangen on the gurdell ben signefied the cyrurgyens  the maistres And knowe ye for certain that a maystre  phisicyen ought to knowe the proporcions of lettres of gramayre / the monemens the conclusions and the sophyms of logyque. the gracio speche and vtterance of rethorique / the mesures of the houres and dayes / and of the cours and astronomye / the nombre of arsmetryk /  the Ioyous songes of musyque And of alle thyse tofore named / the maistres of retho|rique ben the chyef maistres in speculatyf / And the two

laste that ben practisiens and werkers ben callyd phisi|cyens and cyrurgyens / how well they ben sage and curyous in thyse sciences / And how well that mannes lyf is otherwhile put in thordonance of the phisicyen or cyrurgyen / yf he haue not sagesse and wysedom in hym self of dyuerce wrytynges and is not expert / And med|lyth hym in the craft of phisique / He ought better be callyd a sear of peple than a phisicyen or cyrurgyen. For he may not be a maystre but yf he be sewre and expert in the craft of phisike that he se not moo than he eth and maketh hoole / And therfore sayth Auy|emie in an Enphormye / yf thou curest the seke man. And knowest not the cause / wherof the maladye ought to be cured / Hit ought to be sayd that thou hast cured hym by fortune and hape more than by ony comynge. And in alle thyse maner of peple / Ther ought to be incure of good maners / Curtoysie of wordes / Chastite of the body promysse of helthe / And as to them that ben seke contynuell visitacion of them / And they ought to enquere the cause of theye sekenessis and the sygnes and tokens of theyr maladyes / As is rehercid in the bookes of the auctours by ryght grete diligence / And spe+cially in the bookes of ypocras galyene and of Auycene And whan many maysters and phisicyens ben assem|blid to fore the pacyent or seke man / They ought not there to argue and dispute one agaynst an other / But they ought to make good and symple colacion to geder. In suche wyse as they be not seen in theyr desputynge on agaynst an other / for to encroche and gete more glorye of the world to them self / than to trete the salute and helthe of the pacyent and seke man / I meruayll why that

whan they see and knowe that whan the seke man hath grete nede of helthe wherfore than they make gretter ob|iection of contraryousnes for as moche as the lyf of man is demened and put amonge them but hit is be cause that he is reputed most sage and wise that argueth and bryn+geth in moste subtyltes / And alle this maner is amonge doctours of lawe that treteth no thynge of mannes lyf. But of temporelle thynges / that he is holden most wyse and best lerned / that by his counceyll can beste acorde the contencions and discencions of men And therfore ought the phisicyens and cyrurgyens leue whan they be to fore the seke men alle dissencions and contrariousnes of wor+des / in suche wyse that hit appere that they studye more for to cure the seke men than for to despute And therfore is the phisicien duly sette to fore the quene / So that it is figured that he ought to haue in hymself chastite and con+tynence of body. For hit apperteyneth somtyme vnto the phisicien to visite and cure Quenes duchesses and coun|tesses and alle other ladyes and see and beholde some secrete sekenessis that falle and come otherwhile in the secretis of nature And therfore hit apperteyneth to them that they be chaste and folowe honeste and chastite / and that they be ensample to other of good contynence / For valerian reherceth that ypocras was of meruayllous con+tynence of his body / For whan he was in the scoles of Athenes / he had by hym a ryght fayr woman whyche was comyn And the yonge scolers and the Ioly felaws that were students promisyd to the woman a besan~t / yf she myght or coude torne the corage of ypocras for to haue to doon wyth her / And she cam to hym by nyght and dyde so moche by her craft that she laye wyth hym

in his bedd / but she coude neuer do so moche y^t she myghte corrumpe his chaste liuynge ne defoule the crowne of his conscience / and whan the yonge men knewe that she had ben with hym all the might And coude not chaunge his contynence / they began to mocque her / And to axe and demande of her the besant that they had gyuen to her. And she answerd That hit was holden a gaged vpon an ymage / For as moche as she might not change his contynence she callyd hym an ymage / And in semblable wyse reherceth Valerian of Scenocrates philosopher that ther laye with hym a woman all night And temp|ted hym disordinaly / but that ryght chaste man / made neuer semblant to her / Ner he neuer remeuyd from his ferme purpoos / In suche wyse as she departid from hym alle confusid and shamed / Cornelius scipion that was sent by the romayns for to gouerne spayne / as sone as he entryd in to the castellis  in to the townes of that lande He began to take away all the thynges that miht styre or meue his men to lecherye wherfore men sayd that he drof  chared oute of the oste moo than two thousand hourdellys / And he that was wyse knewe well that delyte of lecherye corrupted and apayred the corages of tho men that ben abandonned to that same delyte / And herof hit is sayd in the fables of the poetes in the first book of the Truphes of the Philosophers by figure. That they that entryd in to the fontayne of the sirenes or mermaydens / were corrumpid and they toke them away with hem / And also ye ought to knowe that they ought to entende diligently to the cures of the enfermytees in cyrugerye / They ought to make theyr playsters acor|dynge to the woundes or sores / yf the wounde be rounde

The enplastre must be round / and yf hyt be longe / hyt muste be longe / and otherwhile hit muste be cured by his contrarye / lyke as hit apperteyneth to phisique / For the hete is cured by cold / and the colde by hete / and Ioye by sorowe / and sorowe by Ioye / and hit happeth ofte tymes that moche peple be in grete paryll in takynge to moche Ioye and lese her membris / and become half benomen in the sodayn Ioye / And Ioye is a replection of thynge that is delectable sprad a brode in all the membris with right grete gladnes And all men entende and desire to haue the sayd ryght grete Ioye naturelly / But they knowe not what may ensue and come therof And this Ioye cometh otherwhile of vertue of conscience / And the wyse man is not wyth out this Ioye And this Ioye is neuer Inter|rupt ne in deffaulte at no tyme For hit cometh of nature And fortune may not take a waye that nature geueth. And merciall saith that Ioyes fugitiues abide not longe But flee away ano~n And valerian reherceth that he that hath force and strengthe raysonable / hath hit of verray matier of complection and that cometh of loue And this Ioye hath as moche power to departe the sowle fro the body / as hath the thondre / wherof hit happend that ther was a woman named lyna whiche had her husbonde in the warre in the shipp is of the romayns / And she sup|posid verily that he was ded / But hit happend that he cam agayn home And as he entryd in to his yate / his wif met wyth hym so deynly not warned of his comyng. whiche was so glad and Ioyous / that in enbrasynge hym she fyll doun ded Also of an other woman to whom was reportid by a fals messanger that her sone was ded / whiche wte home soroufully to her hows / And

afterward whan her sone cam to her / As sone as she sawe hym / she was so esmoued with Ioye y^t she deyde to fore hym / But this is not so grete meruaylle of wo|men as is of the men / For the women ben likened vnto softe waxe or softe ayer and therfor she is callid mulier whyche Is as moche to saye in latyn as mollys aer. And in english soyfte ayer / And hit happeth ofte tymes that the nature of them that ben softe and mole / taketh sonner Inpression than the nature of men that is rude and stronge / Valerye reherceth a sayth that a knyght of rome named Istaulosus that had newly conquerid and subiuged the yle of Corsika / And as he sacrefyed his goddes / he receyuyd lettres from the senate of rome In whiche were conteyned dyuerce supplicacyons / The whiche whan he vndrstood he was so glad and so enterprysed wyth Ioye that he knewe not what to doo And than a grete fuce or smoke yssued out of the fyre In whiche he dispayred and fyll in to the fyre / where he was anone ded / And also it is sayd that Philo|menus lawhed so sore and distemperatly that he deyde alle lawhynge / And we rede that pocras the phisicien fonde remedye for thys Ioye / For whan he had longe dwellyd oute of his contreye for to lerne connynge and wysedom / And shold retorne vnto his parentis and frendes / whan he approchid nyghe them / He sente a messanger to fore for to telle to them his comynge / and comanded hym to saye that he cam for they had not longe to fore seen hym And y^t they shold attempre them in that Ioye er they shold see hym / And also we rede that Titus the sone of vaspasian whan he had conquerd Iherusalem and abode in y^e contrees by he herde y^t his fader vaspasian

was chosen by alle the senate for to gouerne the empire of rome / wherfore he had so right grete Ioye that soda|ynly he loste the strength of all his membres And he cam all Impotent And whan Iosephus that made the historye of the romayns ayenst the Iewis / whiche was a ryght wyse phisicien sawe and knewe the cause of this sekenes of the sayd Titus / he enquyred of his folk yf he had in hate ony man gretly so moche that he myght not here speke of hym ner well see hym And one of the seruantes of Titus sayd that he had one persone in ha so moche. That ther was no man in his court so hardy that durste name hym in his presence / and than Iosephus assigned a day whan this man shold come / and ordeyned a table to sette in y^e sight of Titus / and dide hit to be replenysshid plenteuously wyth alle dayntees / and ordeyned men to be armed to kepe hym in suche wyse that no man shold hurte hym by the comandement of Titus / and ordeyned boutellers. Coques / and other officers for to serue hym worshipfully lyke an Empour / and whan all this was redy / Iosephus brought in this man that tytus hated and sette hym at the table to fore his eyen and was seruyd of yonge men wyth grete reuerence ryght cortoisly / And whan titus behelde his enemye sette to fore hym wyth so grete honour / He began to chauffe hym self by grete felonnye And comanded his men that this man shold be slayn / And whan he sawe / that none wold obeye hym But that they allway seruyd hym reuerently / he waxe so ardante / and enbrasid wyth so grete yre / that he that had lost alle the force and strengthe of his body and was alle Impotent in alle his membres / Recoured the helthe agayn and strenghte of his membris / by the hete

that entryd in to the vaynes and finewis And Iosephus dide so moche that he was recouerid and hole / And that he helde that man no more for his enemye / but helde hym for a verray true frende / And afterward made hym his loyall felawe and compaignon And the espicers and Apotecayres ought to make truly suche thynges as Is comanded to them by the physicyens / And they ought accomplisshe theyr billis and charge curyously wyth grete disygence / that for none other cause they shold be ocupied but in makynge medicynes or confections truly. And that they ought vpon paryll of theyr soule not to forgete / by negligence ne rechelesnes to gyue one mede+cyne for an other / In suche wyse that they be not sears of men / And that they do putte no false thynges In her spyces for to empayre or encrecynge the weyght. For yf they so doo they may better be callyd theuys than espicers or apotecayris / And they that ben acusto|med to make oynements they ought to make hyt pro|prely of true stuf and of good odoure after the receptes of the auncyent doctours / And after the forme that the phisicyens and cyrurgyens deuyse vnto them / Also they ought to beware that for none auayle ne gyfte that they myght haue / that they put in theyr medicynes no thynge venemous ner doynge hurte or scathe to ony persone of whom they haue none good ne veray knowlege / to thende that they to whom the medicynes shold be gyuen / torne not to them hurte ne domage / ne in destructions of theyr neyghbours / and also that they that haue mynystrid tho thyngis to them / ben not taken for parteners of the blame and of the synne of them The cyrurgyens ought also to be debonayr. amyable.  to haue pytye of their pacyents.

And also they ought not be hasty to launse and cutte apostumes and soores / ne open the heedes / ner to arrache bones broken / but yf the cause be apparant / For they myght ellys lose theyr good renome And myght better be callyd bouchers than helars or guarisshors of woun+des and soores And also hit behoueth that alle this ma|ner of peple foresayd that haue the charge for to make hole and guarisshe alle maner of maladyes and Infir|mitees that they first haue the cure of them self / and they ought to purge them self fro alle apostumes and alle vi+ces / In suche wyse that they be net and honeste and en|formed in alle good maners / And that they shewe hem hole and pure  redy for to hele other And herof sayth Boecius de Consolacione In his first booke that the ster|res that ben hid vnder the clowdes maye gyue no light. And therfore yf ony man wole beholde clerly the write. Late hym wythdrawe hym fro the obscurete and der|kenes of the clowdes of ignorance / for whan the engyne of a man sheweth in Ioye or in sorowe / The pensee or thought is enuoluped in obscurete  vnder the clowdes.


The sixthe chapitre of the thirde booke treteth of the sixth pawn / whiche is lykened to tauerners hostelers and vitayllers.
THe sixthe pawn whiche standeth to fore the Alphyn on the lyfte syde is made in thys forme. For hit is a man that hath the right hande strac|ched oute as for to calle men / And holdeth in his lyfte hande a loof of breed and a cuppe of wyn / And on his gurdell hangynge a boudest of keyes / And this resem|bleth the Tauerners. hostelers. and sellars of vitaylle. And thise ought proprely to be sette to fore the / Alphyn

as to fore a Iuge For ther sourdeth ofte tymes amonge hem contencion noyse and stryf / whiche behoueth to be determyned and trayted by the alphyn / whiche is Iuge of the kynge / And hit apperteyneth to them for to seke and enquyre for good wyns and good vitayll for to gyue and selle to the byers / And to them that they her|berowe / And hit apperteyneth to them well to kepe their herberowes and Imes / and alle tho thyngis that they brynge in to theyr loggynge and for to putte hyt in seure and sauf warde and kepynge / And the firste of them Is signefyed by the lyfte hande in whiche he bereth brede and wyn / and the seconde is signefied by the right hande whiche Is strached oute to calle men / And the thirde is representid by the keyes hangynge on y^e gurdell And thyse maner of peple ought teschewe the synne of glotonye / For moche peple comen in to theyr howses for to drynke and to ete for whyche cause they ought resonably to rewle them self and to refrayne them from to moche mete and drynke / to thende that they myght the more honestly delyuere thyngis nedefull vnto the pe+ple that come vnto them / And no thynge by oustrage that myght noye the body / For hit happeth ofte tymes that ther cometh of glotonye tencyons. stryfs. ryottes. wronges. and molestacyons / by whiche men lese other while their handes. theyr eyen. and other of their mem|bres / And somtyme ben slayn or hurt vnto the deth / As it is wreton In vitas patrum As on a tyme an heremyte wente for to visite his gossibs / And the deuyll apperyd to hym on the waye in lykenes of an other heremyte for to tempte hym / and saide thou hast lefte thyn heremitage And goost to visyte thy gossibs / The behoueth by force

to doo one of y^e thre thynges that I shall saye to the / thou shalt chese whether thou wylt be dronke / or ellys haue to do flessly wyth thy gossib or ellys thou shalt se her husbond whiche is thy gossip also / And the hermyte that thought for to chese the lefte euyll chace for to be dronke / and whan he cam vnto them he dranke so moche that he was veray dronke And whan he was dronke and eschauffed wyth the wyn / he wold haue a doo wyth hys gossib / And her husbonde wythstode hym. And than the hermyte slewe hym / And after that saye by his gossib and knewe her flessly / And thus by this synne of dronkenship he accomplisshid the two other synnes / By whyche thynge ye may vnderstande and knowe y^t whan the deuyll wyll take one of the castellis of Ihesu cryst / that is to wete the body of a man or of a woman / he doth as a prynce that setteth a iege to fore a castell that he wold wynne / whiche ente~deth to wynne the gate / For he knoweth well whan he hath wonne the gate / he may sone doo hys wylle wyth the castell. And in lyke wyse doth the deuyll wyth euery man and woman. For whan he hath wonne the gate / that is to wete the gate of y^e mouth by glotonye or by other synne He may doo wyth the offices of the body alle his wylle as ye haue herd to fore / And therfore ought euery man ete and drynke so brely in suche wyse as he may lyue. And not lyue to ete glotonsly a for to drynke dronke ye see comunly that a grete bole is suffisid wyth right a lityll pasture / And that a wode suffiseth to many ole|fauntes And hit behoueth a man to be fedde by the erthe or by the see / neuertheles it is no grete thynge to fede the bely / no thynge so grete as is the desire of many metes

Wherof Quyntylian sayth / That hit happeth ofte tymes in grete festes  dyners / that we be fylde wyth the sight of the noble and lichorous metis and whan we wolde ete we ben saciat and fild / And therfore hit is sayd in prouerbe / hit is better to fylle the bely than the eye / And lucan sayth that glotonye is the moder of alle vices / and especiall of lecherye / and also is destroyer of all goodes And may not haue suffisance of lityll thynge / A coue|tous honger what sekest thou mete and vitayllis on the lande  in the see / And thy Ioye is nothynge ellis but to haue playnteous disshes  well fylde at thy table lerne how men may demene his lyf wyth lityll thynge / And Cathon sayth in no wyse obeye to glotonye whiche is frende to lecherye / And the holy doctour saynt Augustyn sayth / the wyn eschauffeth the bely that falleth anone, to lecherye / The bely and the membrers engendreurs ben neyghebours to lecherye / And thus the vice of glotonye prouoketh lecherye / wherof cometh forgetenes of his mynde and destruction of alle quyk and sharp reson And is cause of distempance of his wittes / what synne is fowler than this synne and more stynkynge ne more domageous. For this synne hath taken away the vertue of the man / his prowesse languisshed / his vertue is tor|ned to diffame / the strengthe of body and of corage is torned by the / And therfore sayth Balle le grant / late vs take hede how we serue the bely  the throte by glo|tonye lyke as we were dombe bestes / and we studye for to be lyke vnto belues of the see / to whom nature hath gyuen to be alleway enclined toward the erthe  ther to loke for to serue theyr belyes / And herof saith Boe|cius de consolacione in his fourth book / that a man that

lyuyth and doth not the condicions of a man / may neuer be in good condicion / Than muste hit nedes be that he be transported in nature of a beste or of a belue of the see. How well that ryght grete men and women full of meruayllous sciences and noble counceyll in thise dayes in the world ben kept and nourisshid in this glotonye of wyns and metes / and ofte tymes ben ouerseen / how suppose ye / is hit not right a perillous thinge that a lord or gouernour of the peple and co~mun wele / how well that he be wyse / yf he eschauffe hym sone so that y^e wyn or other drynke surpryse hym and ouercome his brayn. his wysedom is lofte / For as Cathon sayth / Ire enpes|sheth the corage in suche as he may not kepe verite and trouthe And anon as he is chauffed / lecherye is meuyd in hym in suche wyse that the lecherye maketh hym to medle in dyuerse villayns dedes / For than his wysedom is a slepe and goon / And therfore sayth Ouide in his booke De remedio amoris / yf thou take many and dy|uerce wyns / they apparylle and enforce the corages to lecherye And Thobie witnessith in his booke / that luxu+rye destroyeth the body / and mynussheth richesses / she loseth the sowle / she febleth y^e strengthe she blyndeth the syght / and maketh the wys hoos a rawe / Ha A ryght euyll and fowle synne of dronkenship / by the perissheth virginite / whiche is suster of angellis possedynge alle goodnes and seurte of alle Ioyes pardurable / Noe was one tyme so chauffed with wyn / that he discouerd and shewid to his sones his preuy membres in suche wyse as one of his sones mocqued hym / And that other co|uerd hem / And loth whiche was a man right chaste. was so alloted by moche drynkynge of wyn / that on

prouendour to their horses / In the first oure of the nyght. the seruant of the hous cam secretly to fore y^e horses for to stele away their prouender / And whan he cam to the lor+des hors / The hors caught wyth his teth his Arme and helde hit faste that he myght not escape / And whan the theef sawe that he was so strongly holden / he began to crye for the grete payne that he suffryd and felte / In suche wyse that the noble mannes meyne cam with the hooste / But in no maner / ner for ought they coude doo They coude not take the theef out of the horses mouth vnto the tyme that the neyghbours whiche were noyed wyth the noyse cam and sawe hit / And than the theef was knowen and taken and brought to fore the Iuge And confessid the feet and by sentence diffinytyf was hanged and lost his lyf / And in the same wyse was an other that dyde so / And the hors smote hym in the visage / That the prynte of the horse shoo and nayles abode euer in his visage / Another caas right cruell and villaynous fylle at tholouse / Hit happend a Ionge man and his fader wente a pilgremage to saynt Iames in Galyce And were logged in an hostelrye of an euyll hoost and full of right grete couetyse / In so moche that he desired and coueyted the goodes of the two pilgrimes And here vpon auysed hym and put a cuppe of siluer se|cretly in the male that the yonge man bare / And whan they departed oute of their loggynge / he folowed after hem and sayd to fore the peple of the court that they had stolen and born away his cuppe / And the yonge man excused hym self and his fader / And sayde they were Innocen of that caas / And than they serchid hem and the cuppe was founden in y^e male of the yonge man

And forthwyth he was dampned to the deth and han+ged as a theef / and this feet doon all the goodes that lan+ged to the pilgrym were deliuerid to y^e oost as co~fisqued And than the fader wente for to do his pilgremage / and whan he cam agayn he muste nedes come  passe by the place where his sone henge on the gibet And as he cam he complaygned to god and to saynt Iames how they might suffre this auenture to come vnto his sone / Anone his sone that henge spack to his fader And sayde how that saynt Iames had kepte hym with out harme And bad his fader goo to the Iuge and shewe to hym the my+racle / And how he was Innocent of that fayte / And whan this thynge was knowen the sone of the pilgryme was taken doun fro y^e gibet / and the cause was brought to fore the Iuge And the hooste was accused of the tray+son / and he confessid his trespaas / and sayd he dide hit for couetyse to haue his good And than the Iuge damp|ned hym for to be hanged on the same gibet where as the yonge pilgryme was hanged And that I haue sayd of the seruantes beynge men / the same I saye of the women as chambriers and tapsters For semblable caas fille in spayne at saynt doune of a chamberier / that put a cup in lyke wyse in the scrippe of a pilgryme / be cause he wold not haue a doo wyth her in the synne of lecherye / wher|fore he was hanged And his fader  moder that were there with hym wente and dyde her pilgremage / And whan they cam agayn they fonde her sone lyuynge / And
than they wente and told the Iuge / whiche Iuge sayd that he wolde not byleue hit tyll a cok and an henne whiche rosted on the fyre were a lyue  the cok crewe. And anon they began wexe a lyue  the cok crewe and

began to crowe and to pasture / and whan the Iuge sawe this miracle / he wente and toke doun the sone / and made the chamberyer to be taken and to be hanged / wherfore I saye that the hoostes ought to hold no tapsters ne cham+beryers / but yf they were good meure and honeste / For many harmes may be falle and come by the disordenat rewle of seruantes.


The seuenth chapitre of the thirde Tractate treteth of kepars of townes customers and tolle gaderers .
THe gardes and kepars of of cytees ben signefied by the .vii. pawn whiche stondeth in the lyfte side to fore the knyght / And is formed in the sem|blance of a man holdynge in his right hande grete keyes And in his lifte hande a potte  an elle for to mesure with And ought to haue on hys gurdell a purse open / And by the keyes ben signefyed the kepars of the cytees and townes and comyn offices / And by the potte and elle ben signefyed them that haue the charge to weye and mete  mesure truly And by the purse ben signefied them that reseyue the costumes. tolles. scawage. peages / and duetes of the cytees  townes And thyse peple ben sette by ryght to fore the knyght / And hit behoueth that the gardes and offycers of the townes be taught And en|seygned by the knyghtes / And that they knowe and enquyre how y^e cytees or townes ben gouerned / whiche apperteyneth to be kept and defended by the knyghtes. And first hit apperteyneth that the kepars of the cyte be dilygente. besy. clere seeynge and louers of the comyn prouffit  wele as well in the tyme of pees as in the tyme of warre / They ought alleway to goo in the cyte and

enquyre of all thynges and ought rapporte to the gouer+nours of the cyte suche thynge as they fynde and knowe And suche thynge as apperteyneth and to the seuerte of the same / and to deno~nce and telle the defaultes and pa|ryls that ther bee / And yf hit be in tyme of warre they ought not to open the yates by nyght to no man / And suche men as ben put in this office / ought to be of good re+nome  fame. trewe. and of good conscience / In suche ma+ner that they loue them of the Cyte or town / And that they put to no man ony blame or vilanye with out cause by enuye. Couetyse ne by hate / but they ought to be sory and heuy whan they see that ony man shold be complay+ned on for ony cause For ht happeth ofte tymes that di+uerce officers accuse the good peple fraudulently / To thende that they myght haue a thanke  be preysed and to abide stille in theyr offices And trewly hit is a grete and hye maner of malyce to be in will to doo euyll and diffame other wyth oute cause to gete glorie to hym self Also the kepars and officers of cytees ought to be suche that they suffre no wronges ne vylonyes to fore the Iu|ges and gouernours of cytees wyth out cause to be doon to them that ben Innocents / but they ought to haue theyr eyen and regarde vnto hym / that knoweth the hertes and thoughtes of alle men / And they ought to drede  doubte hym wyth oute whos grace theyr wacche and kepynge is nought And that promyseth to them that doubte hym shall be ewrous  happy / And by hym ben alle thynges accomplisshid in good / Hit is founden in the historyes of rome that Temperour Frederik the seconde dide do make a gate of marble of meruayllous werke and entayll in the cyte of capnane vpon the watre that renneth aboute

the same / and vpon this yate he made an ymage lyke hym self sittynge in his mageste / and two Iuges whiche were sette / one on the right side and that other on the lifte side. And vpon the sercle aboue the hede of the Iuge on y^e ryght side was wreton / Alle they entre seurly that will liue pu+rely / And vpon the sercle of the Iuge on the lift side was wreton The vntrewe man ought to doubte / to doo thynge that he be put to prison fore / and on the sercle aboue them|our was wreton / I make them lyue in misery / that I see lyue dismesurably / And therfore hit apperteyneth to a Iuge to shewe to the peple for to drede and doubte to doo euyll / And hit apperteyneth to the gardes and officers to doubte the Iuges and to do trewly their seruyces and offices And hit apperteyneth to a prynce to menace the traytours and the malefactours of right greuous paynes. And herof we fynde in the auncyent historyes of cecylle that the kynge denys had a broder whom he louyd sore well / But allway where he wente he made heuy and tryste semblant / And thus a they wente bothe to gyder on a tyme in a chare / ther cam agayn hem two poure men wyth glad visage but in foule habite And y^e kynge anon as he sawe them / sprange out of his chare and resseyuyd them worshipfully with grete reuerence / wherfore his ba+rons were not only ameruaylled but also angry in their corages / notwithstandynge fere and drede letted them to demande hym the cause But they made his broder to de|mande the cause and to knowe the certaynte / And whan he had herde his broder saye to hym the demande / and that he was blessyd  also a kynge whiche was ryche and full of delites  worshipis / he demanded hym yf he wold assaye  knowe the grace and beneurte of a kynge

And his broder answerd ye / And that he desired and requyred hit of hym / and than the kinge comanded vnto alle his sugettis that they shold obeye in alle thynges only vnto his broder And than whan the oure of dyner cam and alle thynge was redy / the broder was sette at the table of the kynge And whan he sawe that he was seruyd wyth right noble botelliers and other officers. And he herde the sownes of musicque right melodious The kynge demanded hym than / yf he supposid y^t he were benerous and blessid. And he answerd I wene well that I am right well blessid and fortunat / and that I haue well proued and fele and am expert therof And than the kynge secretly made to be hanged ouer his heed a sharp cuttynge swerde hangynge by an hors heer or a sil+ken threde so small that no man myght see hit where by hit henge / and whan he sawe his broder put no more his hand to the table / ne had no more regarde vnto his ser|uantes / he sayd to hym why ete ye not / ar ye not bles|sid / saye yf ye fele ony thynge otherwyse than blessid and well / And he answerde for as moche as I see this sharp swerde hangynge so subtilly and parillously ouer my hede I fele well that I am not blessid for I drede that hit shold falle on my hee / and than discouerd the kynge vnto hem alle wherfore he was allway so heuy cherid and triste For where he was / he thought alleway on the swerde of the secrete vengeance of god / whiche he behelde alleway in his herte / wherfore he had allway in hym self grete drede And therfore he worshipid gladly the poure peple wyth glad visage and good conscience And by this sheweth the kynge well / that what man that is allway in drede is not allway mery or blessid.

And herof sayth Quyntilian that this drede surmoun|teth alle other maleurtees and euyllys / For it is male|urte of drede nyght and day / And it is verite that to hym that Is doubtid of moche peple / so muste he doubte moche / And that lord is lasse than his seruantes that dredeth hys seruantes / And truly hit Is a ryght sure thynge to drede no thinge but god / And sumtyme right hardy men ben constrayned to lyue in drede / Drede causeth a man to be curyous and besy to kepe the thynges that ben commysed to hym that they perisshe not / But to be to moche hardy  to moche ferdfull / bothe two ben vices The comyn officers ought to be wise. discrete. and well aduysed in suche wyse that they take not of y^e peple ne requyre no more than they ought to haue by reson / ne that they take of the sellars ne of the byars no more than the right custom and toll / for they bere the name of a co~mun sone / and therfore ought they to shewe them co~mune to all men / and for as moche as the byars and sellars haue somtyme moche langage / they ought to haue with them these vertues / that is to wete pacience and good corage with honeste for they that ben despiteus to the co~mun / ben otherwhile had in vilayns despite / therfore beware y^t thou haue no despite to the poure mendicants / yf thou wilt come and atteyne to thingis souerayn for the Iniurye that is don wyth oute cause / torneth to diffame hym that doth hit / A Iogheler on a tyme beheld socrates and said to hym / thou hast the eyen of corrumpour of children  art as a traytre. And whan his disciples herde hym / they wold auengid their maister But he repreuyd hem by suche sentence sa|ynge / Suffre my felaws for I am he and suche one as he saith / by the sight of my visage / But I refrayne and

kepe me well from suche thynge / This same socrates hym self was chidde and right fowll spoken to of his wyf / and she Imposid to hym many grete Iniuries with out nombre / and she was in a place a boue ouer his heed And whan she had brawlid Inowh / she made her wa|tre and pourid hit on his heed And he answerd to here no thynge agayn / sauf whan he had dryed and wypid his heed he said / he knewe well that after suche wynde and thonder sholde comen rayn and watre And the phi+losophres blamed hym that he coude not gouerne two women / that was his wyf and his chambrere / And shewde hym that one cokke gouerned well .xv. hennes He answerd to them that he was so vsed and accusto|med wyth theyr chydynge that the chydynges of them ne of estrangers dyde hym no greef ne harme / gyue thou place to hym that brawleth or chydeth / and in suffrynge hym thou shalt be his vaynquysshour / And Cathon sayth whan thou lyuyst ryghtfully recche the not of the wordes of euyll peple / And therfore it is sayd in a comyn prouerbe / he that well doth reccheth not who seeth hit /  hit is not in our power to lette men to speke And prosper sayth that to good men lacketh no good|nes / her to euyll men tencions stryfs and blames And pacience is a right noble vertu / as a noble versifier sayth That pacience is a ryght noble maner to vaynquysshe. For he that suffreth ouercometh. And yf thou wylt vaynquysshe and ouercome / lerne to suffre / The peagers ner they that kepe passages ought not to take other peage ne passage money but suche as the prynce or the lawe haue establisshid / so that they be not more rob|beurs of monoye than reseyuours of peage and passage

And hit apperteyneth to them to goo out of the paryllo weyes and doubteuous for to kepe their office and they ought to Requyre theyr passage of them that owe to paye hit wyth oute noynge and contencion / And they ought not to loue the comyn prouffyt so moche / That they falle in the hurtynge of theyr conscience / For that shold be a manere of robberye / And herof sayth ysaye Woo to the that robbest / For thou thy self shalt be robbed / The gardes or porters of the gates of cytees and of the comyn good ought to be good and honeste. And alle trouthe ought to be in them and they ought not to take ne withdrawe the goodes of the comyn that they haue in kepynge / more than apperteyneth to them for theyr pension or ee So that they that ben made tresorers and kepars ben not named theuys / For who that taketh more than his He shall neuer thryue wyth alle ner shall not enioye hit longe For of euyll gooten good the thyrde her shall neuer reioyce / And this suf|fisith .


This eygth chapitre of the thirde book treteh of Ry|bauldis players of dyse and of messagers and corrours
THe rybauldes. players of dyse And the messan+gers and corrours ought to be sette to fore the rook For hit apperteyneth to the rook whiche is vicayre  lieutenant of the kynge to haue men couenable for to renne here and there for tenquyre  espie the place and cytees that myght be contrarye to the kynge / And thys pawn that representeth thys peple ought to be for|med in this maner he must haue the forme of a man that hath longe heeris and black and holdeth in his ryght hand a lityll monoye And in his lyfte hande thre Dyse

And aboute hym a code in stede of a gyrdell / and ought to haue a boxe fulle o lettres And by the first / whiche is money is vnderstand they that be fole large  wastours of theyr goodes / And by the seconde whiche is the dyse Ben represented the players at dyse / Rybauldes and butters / And by the thyrde whiche is the boxe full of lettres ben representid the messagers. corrours / And berars of lettres / And ye shall vnderstande that the roock whiche is vicaire of the kynge whan he seeth to fore hym suche peple as ben folelarge and wastours. He is bounden to constitute and ordeyne vpon them tu|tours and curatours to see that they ete not ne waste in suche maner theyr goodes ne theyr heritages / that pouerte constrayne hem not to stele / For he that of custome hath had haboundance of moneye and goth and dispendith hit folily and wasteth hit away / whan he cometh to pouerte and hath nought / he muste nedes begge and are his breed. orellis he muste be a theef / For suche maner of peple / yf they haue ben delicyous they wyll not la|boure / for they haue not lerned hit And yf they be noble and comen of gentilmen / they be ashamed to axe and begge / And thus muste they by force whan they haue wasted theyr propre goodes yf they wyll lyue they muste stele and robbe the goodes of other And ye shall vnderstande that folelarge is a right euyll vice / for how well that she dooth good and prouffit somtyme to other yet she doth harme and domage to hym that so wasteth. Cassiodore admonesteth the fole larges to kepe theyr thynges / that by no necessite they falle in pouerte / And that they be not constrayned to begge ne to stele of other men For he saith that hit is gretter subtilte to kepe well

his owne goodes / than to fynde strange thynge / and that it is gretter vertue to kepe that is goten than to gete and wynne more / and claudian saith in like wise in his book that hit is a gretter thynge  better to kepe that is goten Than to gete more And therfore hit is sayd y^t the poure demandeth and beggeth er he felith / and also hit is sayd that he y^t dispendith moe than he hath / with oute strook he is smyten to the deth / Ther was a noble man named Iohn de ganazath whiche was ryght ryche / And this man had but two doughters whom he maryed to two noble men / And whan he had maryed them / he loued so well his sones in lawe their husbondes / that in space  succession of tyme / he departed to them alle his goodes temporell / And as longe as he gaf to them they obeyed hym  were right diligent to plese and serue hym so hit befell that on a tyme that he had alle gyuen in so moche that he had ryght nought / Than hit happend that they to whom he had gyuen his goodes / whiche were wonte to be amyable  obeyssant to hym as longe as he gaf. Whan tyme cam that he was poure and knewe that he had not they becam vnkynde Disagreable and disobey|ssant / And whan the fader sawe that he was decey|uyd by his debonayrte and loue of his doughters / He de+sired and coueyted sore teschewe his pouerte / At laste he wente to a marchant that he knewe of olde tyme. And requyred hym to ene to hym .x. thousand pound for to paye and rendre agayn wyth in thre dayes / And he lente hit hym / and whan he had brought hit in to his how / Hit happend that hit was a day of a solempne feste / on whiche day he gaf to his doughters and her husbonde a right noble dyner / and after dyner he entrid

in to his chambre secretly wyth them / And drewe out of a coffre that he had do make all newe shettynge with iii. lockis / the menoye that the marchant had lente hym And poured out vpon a tapyte that his doughtres and theyr husbondes myght see hit / And whan he had she|wid hit vnto them he put hit vp agayn and put hit in to the cheste faynynge that hit had ben all his And whan they were departed he bare the money home to the mar|chant that he had borowed hit of / And the next day after his doughters and theyre husbondes Axid of hym how moche moneye was in the cheste that was shette wyth .iii. lockis / And than he fayned and saide that he had therin .xxv. thousand pound / whiche he kepte for to make his testament and for to leue to his doughters and hem / yf they wolde bere hem as well to hym ward as they dyde whan they were maried / And than whan they herde that / they were right Ioyous and glad And they thoughte and concluded to serue hym honorably as well in clothynge as in mete and drynke  of alle other thynges necessarye to hym vnto his ende And after this whan the ende of hym began tapproche / he callyd his doughters and her husbondes and sayd to hem in thys maere / ye shall vnderstande that the moneye that is in the chest shette vnder .iii. lockes I wylle leue to yow Sanynge I wyll that ye gyue in my presence er I dye whilis I lyue to the frere prechours .C. pound and to the frere menours .C. pound / And to the heremytes of saynt Augustyn .l. pound to thende that whan I am bu+ryed and put in the erthe ye maye demande of them the ke+yes of y^e cheste where my tresour is Iime / whiche keyes they kepe / and I haue put on eche keye a bille  writynge

In witnessinge of the thynges aboue sayd / And also ye shall vnderstande that he dyde do to be gyuen whilis he laye in his deth bedde to eche churche and recluse and to youre peple a certayn quantyte of moneye by the handes of his doughters husbondes / whiche they dyde gladly. In hope to haue shortly the money that they supposid had ben in the cheste / And whan hit cam to the last day / that he deyde / He was born to churche and his exequye don and was buryed solempnly / And the eygth day the seruyse worshipfully accomplisshid / They wente for to demande the keyes of the Religious men that they had kept / whiche were deliueryd to them / And than they wente and opend the coffre where they supposid the money had ben I / And there they fonde no thyng but a grete clubbe / And on the the handlynge was wre+ton / I Iohn of canazath make this testament / that he be slayn wyth this clubbe / that leuyth his owen prouffit. And gyuyth hit to other / as who sayth hit is no wy|sedom for a man to gyue his good to his children and kepe none for hym self / And ye shall vnderstande that it is a grete folye to dispende and waste his good / In hope for to recoure hit of other be hit of sone or doughter or ryght nyghe kyn / For aman ought to kepe in his hande in dispendynge his owen goodes / to fore he see that he dyspende other mennys / And he ought not to be holden for a good man / That hath lityll renome and spendeth many thyngys / And I trowe that suche per|sones wold gladly make noueltees as for to noye and greue seignories and meue warres and tencions aga|ynst them that habounde in rychesses and goodes / And also make extorcyons clamours  trybulacyons ayenst

theyr lordes to thende to waste the goodes of the peple. lyke as they haue wasted theyris And suche a wastour of goodes may neuer be good for the comyn prouffit. And ye shall vnderstande that after these wastours of goodes we saye that the pleyars of dyse and they that vse bordellis ben worst of alle other For whan the hete of playnge at the dyse / And the couetyse of theyr styn|kynge lecherye hath brought hem to pouerte / hit folo|weth by force that they muste ben theuys and robbeurs And also dronkenship. glotonye. And alle maner of euyllis folowe them and myschief / And they folowe gladly the companyes of knyghtes and of noble men whan they goon vnto the warre or batayllis And they coueyte not so moche the victorye as they do the robberie And they do moche harme as they goo And they brynge lityll gayn or wynnynge / wherof hit happend on a tyme that saynt bernard rode on an hors aboute in the contrey And mette wyth an hasardour or dyseplayer / whiche sayd to hym / thn goddes man wilte thou playe at dyse wyth me thyn hors ayenst my sowle / to whom saynt Bernard answerd / yf thou wilt oblige thy sowle to me ayenst my hors / I wolle a lighte doun  playe wyth the / and yf thou haue mo poyntes than I on thre dyse I promyse the thou shalt haue myn hors / And than he was glad / and ano~n caste .iii. dyse / And on eche dyse was a syse / whiche made .xviii. poynts And anone he toke the hors by the brydell / as he that was sewr that he had wonne / and said that the hors was his And than saynt Bernard sayde abyde my sone For ther ben mo poyntes on the dyse than .xviii. And than he caste the dyse / In suche wyse that one of the .iii. dyse clefte a

sonder in the myddes / And on that one parte was syse and on that other an Aas / And eche of that other was a syse / And than Saynt Bernard sayde That he had wonne hys sowle for as moche as he had caste on thre dyse .xix. poynts / And than whan thys player sawe and apperceyuyd thys myracle / He gaf hys sowle to saynt Bernard and be cam a monke and finysshid his lyf in good werkes / The corrours and berars of lettres ought hastely and spedily do her viage that is coman|ded hem / with oute taryenge / For their taryenge might noye and greue them that sende hem forth / or ellis them to whom they ben sent too / And torne hem to ryght grete domage or villonye / for whiche cause euery noble man ought well to take hede to whom he deliuere his lettres and his mandements / and otherwhilis suche peple ben Ioghelers  dronkelewe / And goon out of their waye for to see abbayes and noble men for to haue auantage And hit happeth ofte tymes / that whan suche messagers or currours ben enpesshid by ony taryenge / That other currours bere lettres contrarye to his / And come to fore hym of which thinges ofte tymes cometh many thinges discouenable of losse of frendes of castellys  of lande  many other thinges as in the feet of marchandise . And otherwhile hit happeth that a prynce for the faulte of suche messangers leseth to haue victorye vpon hys enemyes / And also ther ben some that whan they come In a cyte where they haue not ben to fore / that ben more besy to visyte the Cyte and the noble men that dwelle theryn / Than they ben to doo theyr wyage / whyche thynge they ought not to doo / But yf they had specy|all charge of them that sente hem forth so to doo.

And also whan they be sente forth of ony lordes or mar+chauntes they ought to be well ware / that they charge hem not wyth ouer moche mete on morenynges ne with to moche wyn on euenynges / wherby her synewis and vaynes myght be greuyd / that they muste for faute of good rewle tarye But they ought to goo and come has|tely for to reporte to their maistres answers as hit apper+teyneth And this suffisen of the thynges aboue sayd.



The fourth tractate  the last of the progression and draughtes of the forsayd playe of the chesse.

The first chapitre of the fourth tractate of the chesse borde in genere how it is made.
E haue deuised aboue the thinges that apperteyne vnto the formes of the chesse men and of theyr offices / that is to wete as well of noble men as of the comyn peple / than hit apperteyneth that we shold deuyse shortly how they yssue and goon oute of the pla|ces where they be sette / And first we ought to speke of the forme and of the facion of the chequer after that hit representeth and was made after / For hyt was made after the forme of the cyte of Babyloyne / In the whiche this same playe was founden as hit is sayd afore / And foure thinges The first is / wher ye shal vnderstande that ye ought to consydere here in fore that .lxiiii. poyntes ben sette in the eschequer whiche ben alle square / The seconde is wherfore the bordeur aboute his hyher than the squa|renes of the poyntes / The thirde is wherfore the comyn peple ben sette to fore the nobles / The fourthe wherfore the nobles and the peples ben sette in their propre places Ther ben as many poyntes in y^e eschequer wyde as full And ye shall first vnderstande wherfore that ther ben

lxiiii. poynts in the eschequyer / For as the blessid saint Iherome saith / the cyte of babilone was right grete and was made alle square / and in euery quarter was .xvi. myle by nombre and mesure / the whiche nombre foure tymes told was .lxiiii. myles / After the maner of lom|bardye they be callid myles / and in france leukes / and in englong they be callid mylis also / And for to represente the mesure of thys cyte / In whiche thys playe or game was founden / The philosopher that fonde hit first ordey+ned a tablier conteynyng .lxiiii. poynts square / the which ben comprised wyth in the bordour of the tablier / ther ben xxxii. on that on side  .xxxii. on that other whiche ben or+deyned for the beaulte of the playe / and for to shewe the maner  drawynge of the chesse as hit shall appere in the chapitres folowynge / and as to the seconde / wherfore y^e bordour of the schequyer is hyher than the table wyth in. hit is to be vnderstande y^t the bordour aboute representeth the walle of y^e cyte / whiche is right hyghe / And therfor made y^e philosopher the bordour more hyghe than y^e tablier And as y^e blessid saint Iherome saith vpon y^e prophesie of ysaye / that is to wete vpon a montayne of obscurete. whiche wordes were said of babilone whiche standeth in chaldee / and nothinge of that babilone that stondeth in egipte / for it is so y^t babilone whiche standeth in chaldee was sette in a right grete playne /  had so hyghe walles that by the heyghte of them / was contynuell derkenes en|vironed  obscurete / that none erthely man might beholde and see the ende of y^e hyghnes of the walle / And therfore ysaye callid hit y^e montaigne obscure / And saint Iherome sayth y^t the mesure of the heyght of this walle was thre thousand paas / whiche extendeth vnto y^e lengthe of thre

myle lombardes / hit is to wete that lombarde mylis and english myles ben of one lengthe And in one of the cor|ners of this cyte was made a toure treangle as a shelde wherof the heyght extended vnto the lengthe of .vii. thousand paas / whiche is .vii. myle english And this towr was callyd the tour of Babell / The walles aboute the tour made a woman whos name was semi+ranus as sayth virgilius / As to the thirde wherfore the comyn peple ben sette to fore the nobles in the felde of the bataylle in one renge First for as moche as they ben ne|cessarye to alle nobles For the rooke whiche standeth on the ryght syde and is vicaire of the kynge what may he doo yf the labourer were not sette to fore hym and la|bourid to mynystre to hym suche temporell thynges as be necessary for hym / And what may the knyght doo yf he ne had to fore hym the smyth for to forge his ar|mours. sadellis. axis and spores and suche thynges as apperteyneth to hym / And what is a knyght worth wyth oute hors and armes / certaynly nothynge more than on of the peple or lasse auenture And in what ma|ner shold the nobles lyue yf no man made cloth and bought and solde marchandyse / And what shulde kynges and quenes and the other lordes doo yf they had no phisicyens ne cyrurgiens / than I saye that the pe|ple ben the glorye of the Crowne And susteyne. the lyf of the nobles And therfore thou that art a lord or a no|ble man or knyght / despise not the comyn peple for as moche as they ben sette to fore the in y^e playe The seconde cause is why the peple ben sette to fore the nobles and haue the table wyde to fore them / is be cause they begyn the bataylle / They ought to take hede and entende to do

theyr offices and theyr craftes / In suche wyse that they suffre the noble men to gouerne the cytees and to coun|ceylle and make ordenances of the peple of the batayll how shold a labourer a plowman or a craftyman coun|ceylle and make ordenance of suche thynges as he neuer lerned / And wote ne knoweth the mater vpon what thynge the counceylle ought to be taken / Certes the co|myn peple ought not to entende to none other thynge but for to do their seruyse and the office whiche is coue+nable vnto hem / And hyt apperteyneth not to hem to be of counceyllys ne at the aduocacions / ne to menace ne to threte noman / for ofte tymes by menaces and by force good counceylle is distroublid / And where good counceyll faylleth / there ofte tymes the cytees ben betra|yed and destroyed / And Plato sayth That the comyn thynges and the cytees ben blessid whan they ben gouer+ned by wyse men / or whan the gouernours studye in wisedom / And so hit apperteyneth to the comyn to lerne to vttre the maters  the maner of procuracion to fore they be counceyllours / For hit happeth oftetymes that he that maketh hym wyser that he vnderstandeth is made more foole than he is / And the fourth cause wherfore y^t ther ben in the taber as many poynts wyde as ben full. hit is to wete for that they what euer they be that haue peple to gouerne / ought ten force to haue cytees  castellis  possessions for to sette his peple theryn / And for to la+boure  doo their ocupacion / For for to haue the name of a kynge with out royame is a name wyde / and honour with oute prouffit / And alle noblesse wyth oute good maners / and with out suche thinges as noblesse may be mayntenyd / ought better be callid folye than noblesse.

And shamefull pouerte is the more greuous whan hit cometh by nature of an hyhe and noble burth or hous. For noman gladly wole repreue a poure man of the co|myn peple / But euery man hath in despite a noble man that is poure yf he haue not in hym good maners and vertuous / by whiche his pouerte is forgoten / and truly a royame with oute haboundance of goodes by whiche hit may be gouerned and prospere / may better be callyd a latrocynye or a nest of theeuys than a royame / Alas what haboundance was some tymes in the royames. And what prospite / In whiche was Iustice / And euery man in his office contente / how stood the cytees that tyme in worship and renome / how was renomed the noble royame of Englond Alle the world dredde hit And spack worship of hit / how hit now standeth and in what haboundance I reporte me to them that knowe hit yf ther ben theeuis wyth in the royame or on the see / they knowe that laboure in the royame And sayle on the see I wote well the fame is grete therof I pray god saue that noble royame And sende good true and politicque counceyllours to the gouernours of the same  / And noblesse of lignage wyth oute puyssance and might is but vanyte and dispite. And hit is so as we haue sayd to fore that the schequer whiche the philosopher ordey|ned represented and figured the sayd cyte of Babilone And in lyke wyse may hit figure a royame and signefye al the wrld And yf men regarde and take heed vnto the poyntes vnto the middes of euery quadrante and so to double euery quadrant to other the myles of this cyte all way doublinge vnto the nombre of .lxiiii. The nom|bre of the same shulde surmounte alle the world / And

not only the world but many worldes by the doublinge of inylis / whiche doublinge so as a fore is sayd shuld surmounte alle thynges / And thus endeth the first cha|pitre of the fourth booke.


The seconde chapitre of the fourth tractate treteth of the draught of the kynge / And how he meuyth hym in the chequer.
WE ought to knowe that in this world / the kyn|ges seygnourye and regne eche in his royame. And in this playe we ought to knowe by the nature of hit how the kynge meueth hym and yssueth oute of his place / For ye shall vnderstande that he is sette in the fourth quadrante or poynt of theschequer. And whan he is black / he standeth in the white / and the knyght on his ryght side in white / And the Alphyn and the rooke in black / And on the lifte side the foure holden the places opposite / And the rayson may be suche / For be cause that the knyghtes ben the glorye  the crowne of the kynge / They ensiewe in semblable residence / that they doo whan they ben sette semblably on the ryght side of the kynge  on the lyfte side of the quene / And for as moche as the rook on the ryght syde is vicayre of the kynge he accompanyeth the quene in semblable siege that the Alphyn doth whiche is Iuge of the kynge / And in lyke wyse the lifte rook  the lyfte Alphyn accompanye the kynge in semblable siege / In suche wyse as they ben sette aboute the kynge in bothe sides wyth the Quene in manere of a crowne / That they may seurely kepe the royame that reluyseth and shyneth in the kynge and in the Quene / In suche wyse as they may conferme and diffende hym in theyr sieges and in theyr places.

And the more hastily renne vpon his enemyes And for as moche as the Iuge. the knyght / and the vicaire. kepe and garnysshe the kynge on that one syde / They that ben sette on the other syde kepe the Quene / And thus kepe they alle the strength and fermete of the royame / And semblably otherwhile for to ordeyne the thynges that apperteyne to the counceyll / and to the besoyngne of the royame / For yf eche man shold entende to his owen proper thynges / And y^t they defended not ner toke hede vnto the thingis y^t apperteynen to the kynge to the comyn and to the royame / the royalme shold ano~n be deuided in parties And thus myght the Iuge regne / And the name of the dignyte royall shold be lost / And truly for as moche as the kynge holdeth the dignyte aboue alle other and the seygnourye royall / therfore hit apperteyneth not that he absente hym longe / ne wythdrawe hym ferre by space of tyme from the maister siege of his royame / For whan he wele meue hym / he ought not to passe at the first draught the nombre of .iii. poynts / And whan he begynneth thus to meue from his whyt poynt / he hath the nature of the rooks of the right syde and of the lifte syde for to goo black or whithe / And also he may goo vnto the white poynt where the gardes of the Cyte ben sette And in this poynt he hath the nature of a knyght. And thyse two maners of meuynge apperteyneth other while to the quene / and for as moche as the kynge and the quene that ben conioyned to geder by mariage ben one thynge as one flessh and blood / therfore may the kynge meue on the lifte side of his propre poynt also wele as he were sette in the place of the quene whiche is black / and whan he goth right in maner of the rook only / And hit

happen that the aduersarie be not couered in ony poynt in the seconde ligne / The kynge may not passe from his black poynt vnto the thirde ligne / And thus he sortisith the nature of the rook on the ryght syde and lyfte syde vnto the place of the knyghtes and for to goo ryght to fore In to the whyte poynt to fore the marchant / And the kynge also sortyst the nature of the knyghtes whan he goth on the ryght syde in two maners / For he may put hym in the wyde space to fore the phisicyen / And in the black space to fore the tauerner / And on the other side he goth in to other two places in lyk wise that is to fore the smyth / and the notarye / And thus as in goynge out first in to .iiii. poynts he sorteth the nature of knygh|tes and also the kynge sortiseth the nature of the alphins at his first yssu in to .ii. places And he may goo on bothe sides vnto the white place wyde / that one to fore y^ smith on that on side / and that other o for the tauerner on that other side All these yssues hath y^e kyng out of his propre place of his owen vertue whan he begynneth to meue. But whan he i ones meuyd fro his propre place  He may not mee but in to one space or poynt and so from one to an other / And than he sortiseth the nature of the comyn peple / and thus by good right he hath in hym self the nature of alle / For alle the vertue that is in the mem+bres cometh of the heed and all meyng of the body / The begynnynge  lyf comen from the herte  And all the dig+nyte that the subgettes haue by execucion and contynuell apparence of their meuynge  yssue The kynge deteyneth hit  is attribed to hym / the victorye of the knightes / the prudence of y^e Iuges / the auctorite of the vicaires or legates The co~tynence of the quene the co~corde  vnyte of y^e peple

Ben not all thise thinges ascribed vnto the honour and worship of the kynge In his yssue whan he meuyd first The thirde ligne to fore the peple he neuer excedeth / Fro in the .iii. nombre alle maner of states begynne to meue For the trynary nombre conteyneth .iii. parties / whiche make a perfect nombre / For a trynarye nombre hath .i.ii.iii. Whiche Ioyned to geder maken .vi. Whiche is the first parfyt nombre And signefieth in this place / vi. persones named that constitute the fection of a royame That is to wete the kynge. the quene. Iuges. knyghtes. the vicaires or legats / and the comyn peple And therfor the kynge ought to begynne in his first menynge of .iii. poyntes / that he shewe perfection of lyf as well in hym self as in other After that the kynge begynneth to mee he may lede wyth hym the quene / after the maner of his yssue For why the quene foloweth vnto two angula|rye places / after the maner of the alphyn / and to a place indirect in the maner of a rook in to the black poynt to fore the phisicien / herin is signefied that the women may not meue neyther make vowes of pylgremage ner of viage wythoute the wylle of theyr husbondes / For yf a woman had a vowed ony thynge / her husbonde ly|uynge / and agayn saynge / she may not yelde ne accom|plisshe her vowe / yf the husbond wyll goo oughwer. he may well goo wyth oute her And yf so be that the husbond wyll haue her wyth hym / she is bounden to folowe hym / And by reson For a man is the heed of a woman / and not econuerso / For as to suche thingis as longe to patrymony / they ben lyke / but the man hath po|wer ouer her body / And so hath not the woman ouer his And therfore whan the kynge begynneth to mee.

the Quene may folowe / And not alleway whan she meuyd it is no nede the kynge to meue / For why four the first lignes be with in the limytes and space of the ro+yame / And vnto the thirde poynt the kynge may meue at his first meuynge out of his propre place / And whan he passith the fourth ligne he goeth oute of his royame. And yf he passe oon poynt late hym beware / For the persone of a kynge Is acounted more than a thousand of other / For whan he exposeth hym vnto the paryllis of bataylle / Hit is necessarye that he goo temperatly and slyly / For yf he be taken or ded / or ellis Inclusid and shette vp / Alle the strengthes of alle other faylle and alle Is fynysshid and loste / And therfore he hath nede to goo and meue wysely / And also therfore he may not meue but one poynt after hys fyrst meuynge but where that euer he goo foreward or bacward or on that one syde or that other or ellis cornerwyse / He may neuer approche hys aduersarye the kynge nerrer than in the thirde poynt / And therfore the kynges in ba+tayll ought neuer tapproche one nyghe that other / And also whan the kynge hath goon so ferre that alle his men be lost / than he is sole / And than he may not endure longe whan he is brought to y^ extremyte / And also he ought to take hede that he stande not soo that a knyght or an other saith chek rook / than the kyng loseth y^e rook / That kynge is not well fortunat that leseth hym to whom his Auctoryte delegate apperteyneth / who may doo the nedes of the royame yf he be priuyd taken or dede / that was pro+uisour of alle the royame / he shall bere a sack on his hede that Is shette in a cyte / And alle they that were theryn ben taken in captiuite and shette vp .



The seconde chapiter of the fourth book of the quene and how she yssueth oute of her place.
WHan the Quene whiche is accompanyed vnto the kynge begynneth to meue from her propre place / She goth in dowble manere / that is to wete as an Alphyn whan she is black / she may goo on the ryght syde  come in to the poynt to fore the notayre And on the lifte syde in the black poynt and come to fore the gardees of the cyte And hit is to wete that she sortiseth in her self the nature in .iii. maners first on the ryght syde to fore the alphyn / Secondly on the lifte syde where the knyght is / And thirdly indirectly vnto the black poynt to fore the phisicyen And the rayson why. Is for as moche as she hath in her self by grace / the auc|torite that the rooks haue by co~myscion / For she may gyue  grau~te many thynges to her subgetts graciously And thus also ought she to haue parfyt wisedom  as the alphyns haue whiche ben Iuges / as hit sayd aboue in the chapitre of the Quene / And she hath not the nature of knyghtes / And hit is not sittynge ne couenable thynge for a woman to goo to bataylle for the fragilite and fe+blenes of her / And therfore holdeth she not the waye in her draught as the knyghtes doon / And whan she is me|uyd ones oute of her place she may not goo but fro oon poynt to an other and yet cornerly whether hit be fore|ward or backward takynge or to be taken / And here may be axid why the quene goth to the bataylle wyth the kynge / certainly it is for the solace of hym / and osten|cion of loue / And also the peple desire to haue succession of the kynge And therfore the tartaris haue their wyues in to the felde with hem / yet hit is not good that men haue

theyr wyuys with hem / but that they abyde in the cytees or within their owne termes / For whan they ben oute of theyr cytees and limytes they ben not sure / but holden suspecte / they shold be shamfast and hold alle men sus|pect / For dyna Iacobs doughter as longe as she was in the hows of her brethren / she kept her virginite / But assone as she wente for to see the strange Regyons. Anone she was corrupt and defowled of the sone of sichem / Seneca sayth that the women that haue euyll visages ben gladly not chaste / but theyr corage desireth gladly the companye of men / And Solynus saith that no bestes femellys desyre to be towched of theyr males whan they haue conceyuyd / Except woman whyche ought to be a best Raysonable / And in thys caas she leseth her rayson / And Sidra wythnesseth the same And therfore in the olde lawe / the faders hadd dyuerce wyues and Anllys to thende whan one was wyth childe they myght take another They ought to haue the visage enclyned for schewe the sight of the men / that by the sight they be not meuyd with Incontynence and diffame of other / And Ouyde sayth that ther ben some That how well that they eschewe the dede / yet haue they grete Ioye whan they ben prayed / And therfore ought the good women flee the curyosites and places wher they myght flle in blame and noyse of the peple.


The fourth chapitre of the fourth book Is of the ys|suynge of the Alphyn.
THe manere and nature of the draught of the Al+phyn is suche / that he that is black in his propre siege is sette on the right side of the kynge / And he that is whyt is sette on the lifte side / And ben

callyd and named black and white / But for no cause that they be so in substance of her propre colour / But for the colour of the places in whiche they ben sette / And alleway be they black or white / whan they ben sette in theyr places / the alphyn on the ryght syde / goynge oute of his place to the ryght sydeward comyth to fore the labourer / And hit is reson that the Iuge ought to def|fende and kepe the labourers and possessions whiche ben in his Iurisdiction by alle right and lawe / And also he may goo on the lyfte syde to the wyde place to fore the phisicien / For lyke as the phisiciens haue the charge to hele the Infirmites of a man / In lyke wyse haue the Iuges charge to appese alle stryues and contencions and reduce vnto vnyte / And to punysshe and correcte causes crymynels / The lyfte alphyn hath also two wayes fro his owen place oon toward y^e right syde vnto the black space wyde to fore the marchant / For the marchants nede ofte tymes counceylle and ben in debate of questions whiche muste be determyned by the Iuges / And that other yssue is vnto the place to fore the rybauldis And that ys be cause that ofte tymes amonge them. falle noyses discencions thefte and manslaghter / wherfore they ought to be punysshid by the Iuges / And ye shall vnderstande that the alphyn goth alleway corner wyse fro the thirde poynt to the thirde poynt kepynge allway his owne siege / For yf he be black / he goth allway black / And yf he be whyte he goth alleway whyte. the yssue or goynge cornerly or angularly signefieth cau|tele or subtylyte / whiche Iuges ought to haue / The .iii. poyntes betoken .iii. thynges that the Iuge ought to at|tende / A Iuge ought to furder rightfull a trewe causes.

secondly he ought to gyue trewe counceyll / and thirdly he ought to gyue and Iuge rightfull sentences after tha legeances / And neuer to goo fro the ryghtwisnes of the lawe / And it is to wete that the Alphyn goth in six drawhtes alle the tablier round aboute / and that he co+meth agayn in to his owen place / And how be hit that alle rayson and good perfection shold be in a kynge / yet ought hit also specially be in them that ben conceyllours of the kynge and the Quene And the kynge ought not to doo ony thynge doubtouse / tyll he haue axid counceyll of his Iuges And of the sages of the royame And ther+fore ought the Iuge o be parfaytly wyse and sage as well in science as in good maners / And that is signe|fied whan they mene from thre poynts in to thre / For the sixt nombre by whiche they goo alle theschequer / And brynge hem agayn in to her propre place in suche wyse that thende of her moeuynge is comoyned agayn to the begynnynge of the place frowhens they departed / And therfore hit is callid a parfayt moeuynge.


The fyfth chapitre of the fourth Tractate Is of the meuynge of the knyghtes.
AFter the yssue of the Alphyns we shall deuyse to yow the yssue  the moeuynge of the knygh|tes / And we saye that the knyght on the right syde is whyt / And on the lifte syde black / And the yssue and moeuynge of hem bothe is in one maner whan so is that the knyght on the ryght syde Is whyt / The lyfte knyght is black / The moeuynge of hem is suche / That the whyte may goo in to the space of the alphyn / as hit apperyth of the knyght on the right side that is whyte.

And hath thre yssues fro his propre place / one on his ryght syde in the place to fore the labourer / And hit is well reson that whan the labourer and husbonde man hath laboured the feldes / the knyghtes ought to kepe them / to thentent that they haue vitailles for them self and their horses / The second yssue is that he may meue hym vnto the black space to fore the notarye or draper. For he is bounden to deffende and kepe them that make his vestementis  couertours necessarye vnto his body. The thirde yssue is that he may go on the lifte syde in to the place to fore y^e marchant whiche is sette to fore the kynge / the whiche is black / And the reson is for as moche as he ought and is holden to deffende the kynge as well as his owen persone / whan he passith the first draught / he may goo foure wayes / And whan he is in the myddes of the tabler he may goo in to .viii. places sondry / to whiche he may renne And in lyke wise may the lyfte knyght goo whiche is black and goth oute of his place in to white / and in that maner goth the knyght fightynge by his myght / and groweth and multiplieth in hys poyntis / And ofte tymes by them the felde Is wonne or lost / A knyghts vertue and myght is not knowen but by his fightynge / and in his fightynge he doth moche harme for as moche as his myght extendeth in to so many poyntis / they ben in many peryllis in theyr fightynge / And whan they escape they haue the honour of the game And thus is hit of euery man the more vail+liant / the more honoured And he that meketh hym self ofte tymes shyneth clerest.


The sixt chapitre of the fourth tractate treteth of the yssue of the rooks and of her progression.
THe moeuynge and yssue of the rooks whiche ben vicairs of the kynge is suche / that the ryght rook is black and the lifte rook is whyte / And whan the chesse ben sette as well the nobles as the co|myn peple first in their propre places / The rooks by their propre vertue haue no wey to yssue but yf hyt be made to them by the nobles or comyn peple / For they ben en|closed in their propre sieges / And the reson why is suche That for as moche as they ben vicaires lieutenants or co+myssioners of the kynge / Theyr auctoryte is of none ef|fecte to fore they yssue out / And that they haue begonne truhaunce theyr office / For as longe as they be within the palais of the kynge / So longe may they not vse ne execute theyr commyssion / But anon as they yssue they may vse theyr auctorite / And ye shall vnderstande that their auctorite is grete / for they represente the psone of the kynge / and therfore where the tablier is wyde they may nne alle the triblier / In lyke wyse as they goon thurgh the royame and they may goo as well white as black as well on the right sid  lifte as foreward and back+ward / And as fer may they renne as they fynde the ta|blier wyde whether hit be of his aduersaryes as of his owen felowship / And whan the rook is in the myddell of the tablier / he may goo whiche way he wyll in to foure right lignes on euery side and hit is to wete that he may in no wyse goo cornerwyse / but allway ryght forth goynge  comynge as afore is sayd / wherfore all the subgettis of the kinge as well good as euyll ought to knowe by their moeuynge that auctorite of y^e vicairca and comyssioners ought to be verray true rightwis  Iuste / and ye shall vnderstande that they ben stronge and

vertuous in bataylle For the two rooks only may va|ynquysshe a kynge theyr aduersarye and take hym / and take from hym his lyf and his royame / And this was doon whan chirus kynge of perse And darius kynge of medes slewe baltazar and toke his royame from hym. Whiche was neuew to enylmoradach vnder whom this game was founden.


The seuenth chapitre of the fourth book treteth of the yssue of the comyn peple 
ONe yssue and one mouynge apperteyneth vnto alle the peple / For they may goo fro the poynt they stande in at the first meuynge vnto the thirde poynt right forth to fore them /  whan they haue so don they may afterward mene no more but fro one poynt ryght forth in to an other / And they may neuer retorne backward And thus goynge forth fro poynt to poynt They may gete by vertue and strengthe / that thynge that the other noble fynde by dignyte / And yf the knyghtes and other nobles helpe hem that they come to the ferthest sygne to fore them where theyr aduersaryes were sette. They acquyre the dignyte that the quene hath graunted to her by grace / For yf ony of them may come to thys sayd ligne / yf he be white as labourer draper phiicyen or kepar of the cyte ben / they reteyne suche dignyte as the quene hath / for they haue goten hit / and than retornynge agayn homeward / they may goo lyke as it is sayd in the chapitre of the quene And yf ony of the pawns that is black / as the smyth the marchant the tauerner and the rybaulde may come wyth oute domage in to the same vtterist ligne / he shall gete by his vertu the dignyte of the black quene And ye shall vnderstande / whan thyse

comyn peple mene right forth in her ligne / and fynde ony noble persone or of the peple of their aduersaries sette in the poynt at on ony side to fore hym / In that corner poynt he may take his aduersarye wherther hit be on the right side or on the lifte / And the cause is that the aduersaries ben suspecyous that the comyn peple lye In a wayte to Robbe her goodes or to take her persones whan they goo vpward right forth. And therfore he may take in the right angle to fore hym one of his aduersaries / As he had espied his persone / And in the lifte angle as rob+ber of his goodes / and whether hit be goynge foreward or retornynge fro black to whyte or whyte to black the pawn must allway goo in his right ligne / and allway take in the corner that he findeth in his waye / but he may not goo on neyther side tyll he hath ben in the furdest ligne of thesehequer / And that he hath taken the nature of the dnghtes of the quene / And than he is a fiers / And than he may goo on alle sides cornerwyse fro poynt to poynt only as the quene doth fightynge and takynge whom he findeth in his waye / And whan he is thus comen to the place where y^e noble his aduersaries were sette he shall be named white fiers or black fiers / after the poynt that he is in / and there taketh he the dignyte of the quene  And all these thinges may appere to them that beholden y^e play of the chesse / and ye shall vnderstande that no noble man ought to haue despite of the comyn peple / for hit hath ben ofte tymes seen / that by their vertu a witte / Diuerce of them haue comen to right highe a grete astate as poopes bisshoppes Emperours and kynges / As we haue in the historye of Dauid that was made kynge / of a shepherd and one of the comyn peple / and of many other .

And in lyke wyse we rede of the contrary / that many noble men haue ben brought to myserye by their defaulte As of gyges whiche was right riche of landes and of richesses And was so proude that he wente and deman+ded of the god appollo / yf ther were ony in the world more riche or more happy than he was / and than he herde a wys that yssued out of the fosse or pitte of the sacrefi+ces / that a peple named agalaus sophide whiche were poure of goodes and riche of corage was more accepta|ble than he whiche was kynge And thus the god Ap|pollo alowed more the sapience  the seurte of the poure man and of his lityll mayne / than he dide the astate and the persone of giges ne of his ryche mayne / And hit is more to alowe a lityll thynge scurly poursiewed than moche good taken in fere and drede And for as moche as a man of lowe signage is by his vertue enhaunsed so moche the more he ought to be glorious and of good renomee / virgile that was born in lombardye of y^e nacion of mantua and was of lowe and symple lignage / yet he was souerayn in wisedom and science and the moste noble of alle the poctes / of whome the renome is and shall be durynge the world / so hit happend that an other poete axid and demanded of hym wherfore he setted not the versis of homere in his book / And he answerd that he shold be of right grete strength and force that shold pluck the clubbe out of hercules handes / And thys suffyceth the state and draughtis of the comyn peple .


The eyght chapitre and the last of the fourth book of the epilogacion and recapitulacion of this book.
FOr as moche as we see and knowe that the me+morye of the peple is not retentyf but right for|getefull whan some here longe talis a historyes whiche they cannot alle reteyne in her mynde or recorde Therfore I haue put in this present chapitre all y^e thynges abouesayd as shortly as I haue conne / First this playe or game was founden in the tyme of emmerodach kynge of Babilone / And exerses the philosopher otherwyse named philometer fonde hit / And the cause why / was for the correction of the kynge lyke as hit apperith in thre the first chapitres for the said kynge was so tyrannous and felon that he might suffre no correction / But slewe them and dide do put hem to deth / that correctid hym / and
had than do put to deth many right wyse men Than the peple beynge sorowfull and ryght euyll plesid of this euyll lyf of the kynge prayd and requyred the philoso+pher / that he wolde repryse and telle the kynge of his folye / And than the philosopher answerd that he shold dede yf he so dide / and the peple sayd to hym / Certes then oughtest sonner wille to dye to thende that thy re|nome myght come to the peple than the lyf of the kynge shold contynue in euyll for lacke of thy counceyll / or by faulte of reprehension of the / or that thou darst not doo and shewe / that thou saist / And whan the philosopher herd this he promisid to the peple y^t he wold put hym in deuoyr to correcte hym / and than he began to thynke in what maner he myght escape the deth and kepe to the peple his promesse / And than thus he made in this ma|ner and ordeyned theschequer of .lxiiii. poynts as Is a fore sayd / And dide doo make the forme of chequers of gold and siluer In humayne fygure after the facyons

and formes as we haue dyuysid and shewid to yow to fore in theyr chapitres / And ordeyned the moeuynge and thestate after that it is said in the chapitres of thes|chesses And whan the philosopher had thus ordeyned the playe or game / and that hit plesid alle them that sawe hit / on a tyme as the philosopher playd on hit / the kynge cam and sawe hit and desired to playe at this game / And than the phylosopher began tenseigne and teche the kynge the science of the playe  the draughtes. Saynge to hym fyrst how the kynge ought to haue in hym self pytie. debonairte and rightwisnes as hit is said to fore in the chapitre of the kynge And he enseygned to hym the estate of the quene and what maners she ought to haue And than of the alphyns as connceyllours and Iuges of the royame And after the nature of the knygh+tes / how they ought to be wise. trewe and curtoys and alle the ordre of knyghthode And than after / the nature of the vicaires  rooks as hit apperyth in theyr chappitre And after this how the comyn peple ought to goo eche in his office / And how they ought to serue the nobles. And whan the philosopher had thus taught and enseig+ned the kynge and his nobles by the maner of the playe and had rephended hym of his euyll maners / The kynge demanded hym vpon payne of deth to telle hym the cause why and wherfore he had made  founden thys playe and game And what thynge meuyd hym therto / And than the philosopher constrayned by fere and drede ans|werd / that he had promysid to the peple whiche had requyred hym that he shold correcte and reprise the kynge of his euyll vices / but for as moche as he doubtid the deth and had seen that the kynge dide do slee the sages  wyse

men / That were so hardy to blame hym of his vices / he was in grete anguysshe  sorowe / how he myght fynde a maner to correcte  reprehende the kynge / And to saue his owen lyf / and thus he thought longe  studyed that he fonde thys game or playe / Whiche he hath do sette forth for to amende and correcte the lyf of the kynge and to change his maners / and he adioustyd with all that he had founden this game for so moche as the lordes and nobles habondynge in delyces  richessis / And enioynge temporell peas shold eschewe ydlenes by playnge of this game / And for to gyue hem cause to leue her pensif|nes and sorowes / In auysynge  studyynge this game. And whan the kynge had herd alle thyse causes / He thought that the philosopher had founde a good maner of correction / And than he thanketh hym gretly / and thus by thenseygnement and lernynge of the phylosopher he changid his lyf his maners  alle his euyll condicions And by this maner hit happend that the kynge that to fore tyme had ben vicyous and disordynate in his liuyng was made Iuste. and vertuous. debonayre. gracious and and full of vertues vnto alle peple / And a man that ly+uyth in this world with out vertues liueth not as a man but as a beste / And therfore my ryght redoubted lord I pray almighty god to saue the kyng our souerain lord  to gyue hym grace to yssue as a kynge  tabounde in all vertues /  to be assisted with all other his lordes in such wyse y^t his noble royame of Englond may prospere  habounde in vertues / and y^t synne may be eschewid iustice kepte / the royame defended good men rewarded malefac+tours punysshid  the ydle peple to be put to laboure that he wyth the nobles of the royame may regne gloriously

In conquerynge his rightfull enheritaunce / that verray peas and charite may endure in bothe his royames / and that marchandise may haue his cours in suche wise that euery man eschewe synne / and encrece in vertuous occu|pacions / Praynge your good grace to resseyue this lityll and symple book made vnder the hope and shadowe of your noble protection by hym that is your most humble seruant / in gree and thanke And I shall praye alimighty god for your longe lyf  welfare / whiche he preserue And sende yow thaccomplisshement of your hye noble. Ioyous and vertuous desirs Amen: / : Fynysshid the last day of marche the yer of our lord god .a. thousand foure honderd and lxxiiii
