Two thinges haue I required of the,
O Lorde, that thou wylt not deny me be|fore
I dye. Remoue frome vanytye and
lyes. Geue me nether pouerte nor riches,
only graunt me a necessarye lyuing, least
if I be to full, I denye the and saye: who
is the Lord?  least I beinge constrained
thorowe pouertie faul vnto stealing, and
forswere the name of my God.

Take no thought, saying, what shal we
eat, or what shal we drynke, or wherwith
shal we be clothed? after al these thynges
seke the Hethe~. For your heauenly father
knoweth, that ye haue nede of all these
thinges. But seke ye fyrste the kyngdom
of God and the righteousnes therof and
al these thinges shall be caste vnto you.

_SO ofte as
I behold the
wretchid and
to much mise+rable
face of
thys needye
and beggerl
world, yea
so ofte as I
consyder the
lamentable 
pytifull, state of the poore people, whych
are nowe growen vnto suche a number,
that they be almoste innumerable, and
so assayled wyth the cruell dartes of po|uertie
and honger, that they in a maner
despaire of necessary foode and conueni|ent
apparel for the sustentation of theyr
poore wretched karcasses, and by thys
meanes for a redresse of these their to ma+nyfolde miseryes parte of theym, whose
braynes are not perfectly setled, whose

iudgementes are not thorowly staied in
the waye of perfecte reason, not pacient+ly
bearynge the crosse of pouertye, con|trary
to Christen order and theyr boun|den
dutye attempte vnto the greate do|loure
of al good men, vngodlye and vn|lawful
enterprises, as wycked councels,
vniust assembles, abhominable sedicio~s,
diuilyshe insurreccions, detestable con|mocions,
vnryghtuous spoylynges of o|ther
mennes goodes, vncharitable ray|lynges
vpo~ theyr superiours.Deut. xxviii, ii. Reg. xvii. Iem. xviii. Ezeh. iiii. v. iiii. xix. xxxii xxiii. se. ii. c. Utter|ly
defacynge, somuche as in theym is,
the face of the common weale, not consy|deryng
thys plage of famyn and honger
to be sent into the world for synne accor|dynge
to the hreatnynges of God ex|pressed
in y^ holy scriptures: I can none
otherwyse the~ lament and hartely wysh
better and more prosperous thynges to
the nedy and poore creatures of god vni|uersally.
For although according to the
common Prouerbe,Commo~ pro|rbes.
Lytel woe the ful sow that is in y^ sye,
What the hungrye sow ayleth, that go|eth
by.
Yet so many as are of God, and ledde
wyth any natural or humaine affeccion,
they remember thys olde sayinge:
It is mery in hel, Whe~ berdes wag al,
and can not euen in the myddes of their
wealth, but repent the mysery of the my|serable,
the pouerty of the poore, the fa|myn

of the famished,The nature of Charitie. romay. xii. and to y^ vttermost
of theyr power studye to reeue the dys|tresse
of the nedy both wyth theyr goods
and councel. As a true Christe~ ma~ ioyeth
wyth them that are glad, euen so sorow|eth
he wyth them that are sad. Charitye
seketh not her owne, but both wisheth 
doth wel to al men,. Corin. xiii euen to her enemies.
Charytye putteth on the propertye of
Christ, whych became poore to make o|ther
ryche. Charytye ioyeth not at her
owne ioy,ii. Corin. viii if other sorowe. Charitie dely|teth
not in her own fulnes, if other wa~t.
Charitie abhorreth her owne reaste if o|ther
be disquieted. I am combred dayly,
sayth S. Paule,ii. Corin. xii and do care for all con|gregacions.
Who is weake, and I am
not weake? Who is offended, and I am
not greued? Yea Charitie refuseth al|most
to be saued, if other enioye not the
lyke benefyt. Dyd not that most excelle~t
prophet Moses desyre God either to for|geue
the chyldren of Israel theyr synnesExodi. xxxii.
or else to wye him out of y^ boke of lyfe?romayne ix
Dyd not blessed Paule wyshe to be
accursed from God so that the Israeli|tes
hys kynsmen after the flesh, myghte
be saued?Actes. vii. Dyd not the gloryous Martyr
Stephen accordynge to the example of
Christ praye for hys enemyts? So wholy
doth Charitie geue her selfe to serue the
health and wealth of other.Luke. xx
And as touchynge the relyefe of the

poore and nedy, oppressed wyth the wa~
of worldly thinges, what good and god|ly
man hath not at al tymes, as occasio~
 habylitie hath serued, sought it? Who
beynge godlye mynded seynge his Chri|sten
brother or syster in necessitie, seketh
not al meanes possible to healye theym?
Can a Christia~ abou~d in worldly wealth
and suffer hys neyghbour to famyshe or
to dye for colde? He hath not put on the
bowels and re~der compassion of Christ,
whych is not moued wyth pitie toward
his nedy neighbour?Hospitalitie. O what goodli and
notable examples doth y^ holy scripture
mynyster vnto vs of socourynge the so|courles?
What a myrroue to beholde is
that most reuerende Patriarke Abraha~
the father of the faythful,Gene. xviii. vnto the fayth+full?
Wyth what alacritie and chereful|nes
of mynde dyd he receaue into hys
house the Angels of God beyng in mens
lykenesse? Wyth what diligence prepa|red
he al thynges necessary for them, as
he thought, weary bodyes? When Loth
saw the two aungels of God, whom he
iudged to be men, co~ming into Sodome
at night howe reuerely did he behaue
hym selfe toward the~,  instantly desyred
the~ to come into his house  ther lodged
y^ night?Gene. xix. I besech you syrs, saith he, turne
into the house of your seruaunte,  abide
ther. Washe your feete,  in the morning
ye shal go forth on your iourney. And af|terwarde

he made them a feast, saith the
Scripture. These two godly auncie~t fa|thers
thought is not mete to suffer strau~+gers
and way farynge men to passe fore|by
theyr houses wythoute relyefe. They
dyd according to Gods holy wyl expres|sed
by the prophet, sayinge. Breake thy
breade to the hungry,Esay. viii. and led the nedye
and the way faring into thy house. Whe~
thou seest a naked ma~, couer him, so shalt
thou not despise thy flesh. Forget not hos+pitalite,
saith S. Paul, for by it, certeyne
vnwars haue receaued angels into theyr
houses.Hebrues. xii How ready pacient Iob was to
socour y^ socourles,  to relyue the nedy,
it is euident by these his wordes: When
the poore desyred any thyng of me,Iob. xxxi. haue
I denied it them? Haue I caused the wi|dow
to stande waityng for me in vaine?
Haue I eaten my porcio~ alone that the
fatherles hath hadde no parte with me?
For mercye grewe vp wyth me fro my
youthe, and compassion fro~ my mothers
wombe. Haue I sene anye man peryshe
thorow nakednes and wa~t of clothyng?
Or any poore man for lacke of raiment,
whose sydes thanked me not because be
was warmed with the wol of my shepe?
Agayne he sayeth, I haue not suffered a
straunger to lye w^tout, but I opened my
doores vnto him, that went by the way.
As I maye passe ouer many other exam+ples,
contayed in the olde Testamente,

which declare how merciful diuers god+ly
both men and women were towarde
straungers and poore people,Marke. viii. how te~der
harted and ful of most louynge pitie and
vnfayned compassion, dyd our Sauiour
Christ shewe hym selfe when he fedde so
manye people wyth seuen loaues and a
fewe small fyshes? I am inwardelye
moued w^t compassyon toward y^ people,
sayeth he, because they haue nowe bene
wyth me .iii. dayes, and haue nothynge
to eate, and if I send them away fasting
to theyr owne houses, they shal faynt by
the way. Moreouer, as I maye let passe
diuers other miracles, which he dyd for
the reliefe of y^ poore, as turnyng water
into wyne at the mariage in Caua Ga|lile,Ioan. ii. oan. vi.
and feedynge fyue thousande wyth
fiue barly loaes  two fishes, did he not
shew hym selfe to take great care for the
poore, when he gaue the ryche men thys
commaundemente? When thou makest
a ynner or supper,Luke. xiiii. cast not thy frendes,
 thy brethren, neyther thy kynsmen,
nor thy ryche neyghbours, least they al|so
byd the agayne, and a recompence be
made the. But when thou makest a feast
cal the poore, the feble, the lame, and the
blynde, and thou shalt be happy, for they
cannot reco~pence the. But thou shalt be
recompenced at the resurreccion of the
iuste menne.Math xxv. In the descripcion of the
generall Iudgement, whyche shalbe at

the last day, is not the rewarde of euer|lastynge
lyfe ser forth to the mercyfull,Iacob. ii. Math v.
and eternal damnacion to the merciles?
The Iudgement, sayth S. Iames, shall
be without mercy, to the~ that hath shew+ed
no mercye. Blessed are the mercyfull,
fo they shall obtayne mercye.Luke. x. Gyue al|messe
of that ye haue, and behold al thin+ges
are cleane vnto you, sayth our Sa|uioure
Christ.Luke. xvi. Was not the rytche glo|to
damned, because he was ledde wyth
no pietie towarde the poore?
O how diligent were the Apostles af|ter
Christes ascencion to appoynt Dea|cons
to mynyster vnto the poore,Actes. vi. xi. and to
prouyde that they lacke nothyng?Ates. xxiiii How
earnest was blessed Paule in exortynge
the Christians to make colleccions for
the poore?oma. xv. Yea howe wroughte he wyth
hys owne handes,i. Corin. xv that he myghte haue
wherof to geue vnto the nedye?ii Cor. viii. What a
frendly lesson in y^e poore peoples behalfe
wryteth he vnto Byshop Timothe to be
declared vnto the ryche worldlynges?Actes. xx.
Co~maund them that are rych (sayth he)
in this worlde,ii. Thess. iii that they be not hie min|ded,i. Timo. v.
nor trust in vncertayne ryches, but
in the lyuynge God, whych geueth vs a|bundantly
al thinges to enioye the~, that
they do good workes, that they be redy
to geue, and gladde to dystrybute, lay|inge
vp in store for theym selfe a good
foundacion agaynste the tyme to come,

that they may obtaine eternallife. How
is Dorcas a noble and vertuous woma~
commended in the holy Scripture? She
was ful of good workes  almes dedes,
saith blessed Luke,. ix. Yea she with her own
handes made coates and garmentes for
the poore.irrours  Ge~tle, . An example worthi to be folo|wed
of our Gentle women and Ladyes
now a dayes, whych in tyringe and gar|nishynge
the~ selues know neyther mea|sure
nor ende, but of preparynge garme~|tes
for the poore, they for the most parte
do not somuche as once dreame. Dorcas
coulde not abyde, that she herselfe shuld
haue a ryche waredroppe full of sumtu|ous
apparel, and se her Christen Brethre~
and systern go naked and dye for colde,
Yea rather then they shoulde wante, she
wyl set her owne ha~des to worke, which
thynge many of our fine whight fingred
Gentyl women, yea and some inferioure
to them dysdayne to do.
How instantly dyd a certayne woma~
named Ldia desyre.etes. xvi. S. Paule and hys
compaions to come into her house, and
there to haue all thynges necessarye for
them?reachers vn+rouided. If ye thynke (saith she) that I be|leue
on the Lorde, come into my house,
and abyde there. Wold God the lyke af|feccion
towarde the Preaches of Gods
woorde were founde in our menne and
women at this present, then shoulde not
so manye of them be oppressed wyth po|uertie,
and wander abrode wythout ly|uinges

as they do nowe, vnto the greate
sclau~der of y^ Gospel, which they preach.
Is it not a shame that they should want
temporal thynges, whych minister vnto
vs spiritual and heaue~ly thynges?i Corin. ix. Hath
not the Lorde ordeyned, that they which
preache the Gospell, shoulde lyue of the
Gospel? Are not they that rule wel, and
laboure in worde and doctryne, worthy
of double honoure? Is it not conuenie~t,
that the housbandeman whyche labou|reth,
shoulde fyrst take of the frutes?i. Timo. v. Are
we not forbydden to mosel the mouth of
the oe that treadeth out the corne?ii. Timo. ii. Is
not a rewarde ordeyned for the worke|man?i. Timo. v.
If we haue sowen among you spi|ritualMath x.
thynges,i. Corin. ix. is it a great mater, if we
reape your carnal thynges? Doo ye not
know that they, whych minister aboute
holy thynges,Math. x. lyue of the sacrifyce? they
whych wayte of the temple, are parta|kers
of the temple. Euen so also dyd the
Lorde ordayne,i. Timo. iii. Titus. i. that they whych preache
the Gospel, should lyue of y^ gospel, saith
S. Paule. The Apostle requireth that a
Bishop, y^ is, a spiritual minister shoulde
mayntaine hospitalitie. How vnsemely
the~ is it for the~ that shuld fede other,Papistes h to fore bet prouided o the~ preaches nowe. ey|ther
myserably to liue on other mes tre~+chers,
or els lyke vagaboundes to hunt a+boute
for theyr lyuinge? Neyther oure
au~cestours nor we in tymes paste haue so
dealt w^t y^ sorcererlyke Sacryfycers, w^t y^

pratyng Papistes, wyth the monstrous
Monckes, wyth the chatrerynge Chan|nons,
wyth the flatterynge fyers, and
such other mumryshe mummers, as vn|der
the vysar of paynted holynes haue
deceyued almost all the worlde, ledynge
vs from Gods blessed worde to mannes
tryfle ingeradicions, from the waye of
saluacion vnto the state of damnacion,
from heauen to hel, from God to the dy|uyl.
But so hath it euer gone for y^ moste
parte wyth the true Preachers in thys
wycked and vnthankeful worlde. In the
tyme of king Achab, the true Prophetes
of God were slayne, and the~ that remai|ned
alyue, were secrelye kepte in caues
and ther fedde wyth bread and water of
good Abdy, whych vnfaynedly feared
God.. xviii. If they had not bene preserued by
that godly man, they hadde eyther bene
slayne, or els famished. But the Preistes
of Baal abounded wyth all kynde of
wealth. Eyght hundred and fyty, sayth
the scripture, did eate of Iesabels table.
Who knoweth not,remie. xx. viii. that the Prophet
Hieremie was throwen into pryso~, cru|elly
entreated and lyke to dye for ho~ger,
whan hashur. the priestes, and suche o|ther
false prophees euen men pleasars,ath. xii.
lyued in al wealth and aboundaunce of
worldly thynges? Wyth what pouertie
the disciples of Christe were greued,athe. viii. . it
may easly be knowen, whe~ they for very

honger were co~pelled to plucke y^ eares
of corne  to eate.Ioan. xviii. zachary. x. Math. xxi. And how poore Christ
was, not a fewe places of the Scripture
do declare, whe~ in y^e meane time Annas,
Caiphas, Alexander, y^e Scribes, y^e Pha|rises,
Lawers, y^e Byshops, the Priestes,
y^ sacrificers w^t al y^e rable of Hipocrites
lyued in al pompe and pleasure. This in
gratitude, churlishnes  illiberalitie to|ward
y^ ministers of gods word shal not
escape vnpunished.Luke. x He y^ despyseth you,
despiseth me, sayeth Christ,  he that de|spiseth
me, despiseth hym y^t sent me.Luke. x. But
let vs returne vnto our matter.Luke. xix.
What nede I reherse,Actes. ix. Martha, Za|che,
Simon the tanner,Actes. xvii. Iason. Aquila,
Philip the Euangelist,Act. xi. xxv Publius, Phile|mon,
Gaius,Galath. vi. and suche other, whyche all
shewed the~ selues courteous, ge~tyl  be|neficial
toward al y^e poore, but chefly to|ward
the~ y^t were of y^ houshold of fayth,
as s. Paule warneth. If we haue recour+se vnto auncie~t histories, O how shal we
learne of the~ the fatherly pytie  Godly
glad affeccio~,O factum bene. which was in y^e Bishops 
Deacons toward the poore people when
Christes churche began to florishe. Read
we not, that for the comfort of the poore
and oppressed Christians, the godly aun|cient
Byshoppes dyd not onelye sell the
Ornamentes, Treasures, and Iewelles
of the churche, but also the verye boxes
of Golde and Syluer, wherein the Lor|des

brea, whych we co~menly cal y^ Sa|crame~t
of the aulter, or our By|oppes. was kept? they had
rather kepe the Sacramente of Christes
bodye in a basket of wyckers, and to fell
that they made of golde for the releife of
the pore, then they shulde wante. O god|ly
Byshoppes and faithfull sheppardes,
whiche so diligently watched for the pre+seruation
of their shepe both bodily and
ghostly. Is it not to be thought, that the
su~mes of money, which the beneficed me~
yerelye paye to the archedecon of euerye
dioceise, were fyrste of all frely graunted
and gyuen of oure predecessoures to be
distributed amo~g the pore people of that
diocease, as necessitie required, and theyr
descrecion serued? But howe that money
is nowe abused, who seeth not? the office
of the archedecon,The ofyce of  Archdeco~. is yerely to visit eueri
paryshe in the diocese, wher he dwelleth,
and diligently to se, what y^ pore people
of euery paryshe want, and to make pro|uision
for them,  vnto that vse, as I said
before, was that mony geuen, which eue|ry
beneficed ma~ payeth to the archedeco~
agayne, to se whither parson or vicar be
resident vpon hys benefice, and maine|taine
such hospytalite, as y^ pore of y^ pa|rish
be y^ better for it. But now a dayes y^
archdco~s aske not for y^ pore, nor in what
co~dicio~ they sta~d, but whether y^ hosts be
wel kept in y^ pyxe fro~ moulding  fur|ring,
whither corpraise clothes be clene
washed, whither the Chrismatory besafe|ly

locked vp, whyther the Prieste vseth
any vnhalowed garme~tes or chalyce in
hys sacrifisynge, whyther y^ copes, vest|me~tes
and albes be sufficie~tly repayred,
whither the Church, Chau~cel, or Church
yard be in case good ynoughe, and suche
other trifles. God haue mercion vs,  se~d
vs once a redresse of these thynges. Fur|thermore
 w^t what a Godly pitie  chari|table
affeccio~ dyd our auncestours burne
toward y^ poore me~bers of Christ,Folowe thes fore fathers. which
as I may speake nothynge of Abbeyes,
Colleges, Chau~tries, frechapels. c. bilt
with theyr greate cost hospitals  suche
other houses, enduing the same w^t yerely
reuenewes for the relife of y^ poore? Men+rie,
fathers, fathers, but the maners of
these fathers are clene forgotte~.Philip. ii. All seke
theyr own auau~tage,  not those thinges
whych pertaine vnto Iesu Christ. Thus
se we y^ al good me~ haue euer pityed the
poore,  sought al meanes possible to do
the~ good. But the co~trary is fou~d amo~g
vs nowe a daies.ii. Timo. iii. For me~ according to s.
Paules prophecy, are the louers of them
selues  not of the poore. They are coue|tous
to the~selfes,  not liberal to y^ poore
They heap to the~selfes, they prouide no|thing
for the poore, ther be many signes
of y^ last day to be at hand, but this colde
affeccio~,  more cold loue,  most cold ly|beralitie
toward y^ poore proue euide~tly
y^ it is not far of. Amo~g mani other signs
and toke~s, which Christ declareth to go

before the daie of Iudgeme~t,Math. xxiiii. is not this
one of the most euident? For asmuch, say|eth
he, as iniquitie shal abound, the loue
of many shal waxe colde. When dyd ini|quitie
euer so abounde? when was y^ loue
of men euer so colde towarde the poore?
The ryche worldelynges in tymes paste
could buylde greate monasteries for the
bellyed Hypocrites,Note. greate Colledges,
Chauntries, and Freechappels, for sub|tle
cariars and Purgatorie rakers, but
who buylde somuche as a cotage nowe
for to harbour a sely poore man? Men in
tymes past disherered theyr lawful hey|res
to nouryshe in ydlenes a numbre of
ydle bellies nder the prete~ce of prayer,
but who now eue~ of his superfluities do|eth
any notable thyng for Christes poore
me~bers? A number of people heretofore
hath decked Idols and mawmets, with
silke, velet, and other precious veslures
yea wyth gold, syluer, pearle, and preci|ous
stones, how many now in so greate
a multitude do cloth y^ poore naked crea+tures
of God wyth canuis and rugge?
They gaue shoes of syluer  golde set w^t 
rych stones to dome mawmets, but who
now geueth shoes of leather to y^ poore?
O touche vnmercyfulnes. Can these
thynges escape vnplaged? If the Lorde
lyueth, plages be at hande, excepte we
amende. Thys oure ingratytude to|warde
God, and vnmercifulnes toward

the poore, wyl surely accelerate  haste
forwarde the vengeauns of God to fall
vpon vs. For whether we respect and be+hold
the spiritualtie or temporalty, their
loue towarde the poore compared wyth
the loue of our Au~cestoures, is very cold,
yea it is almost nothing. But if we com|pare
theyr coueuousnes with the desire
of our Elders toward the goodes of the
worlde,Spiritual me~ couetou we shal fynde it so farre to excel
and surmount, as the hie heauens do the
lowe earth. How do many of oure spiri|tual
men, as they are called, heape pro|mocion
vpon promocion, benefyce vpon
benefyce, deanrye vpon deanrie, prebend
vpon prebend, and prebe~d for auau~tage?
Ah, one ylthy belly to deuoure so many
wealthy lyuinges? O abominacio~. And
yet the carelesse swyne are led wyth no
pitie toward the poore, whose sweate of
theyr browes they lyk vp, whose labou|res
of theyr handes they cormorantlyke
deuour. Behold theyr paine in teaching,
it is very smal, behold their hospitalitie,
it is nothinge at all. Woo be vnto these
shepherdes, saith God by the Prophete,
that fede the~selues. Shulde not y^ shepe|herdes
fede the flockes?Ezech. xxxi Ye haue eate~ vp
the fat, ye haue clothed you wyth y^ wol,
the best fed haue ye slayne, but the flocke
haue ye not nourished. The weake haue
ye not holde~ vp, y^ sycke haue ye not hea|d
the broke~ haue ye not bou~d togither,

y^ outcasts haue ye nor brought againe,
the lost haue ye not sought, but churlish|ly
 cruelly haue ye ruled them.Temporal  couetous. Agaye
how do many of the temporal worldlin|ges
ioyne ferme to ferme, office to office,
lordshyp to lordshyp, pasture to pasture,
land to land, house to house,  house for
auauntage? that the vengeaunce of God
threatned by the Prophetes maye come
vpon the~.saye v. Wo be vnto you, y^ ioyne house
to house,  couple land to lande, so nyghe
one to another, that y^ poore man can get
no more ground. Shal ye dwel alone vp|on
the face of the earth? These thynges
are come vp vnto my eares, sayth y^ Lord
of hostes. Shal not many great  gorgi|ous
houses be so waste that no man shal
dwell in the~?ab auk. ii. Agayne, wo be vnto hym, y^
heapeth vp other me~s goodes. How lo~g
wyl he lade hym selfe w^t the thycke clay?
Wo be vnto hym, y^ couetously gathereth
euyl gotten goodes into hys house, that
he maye set his nest on hye, to escape fro~
the power of misfortune. Thou hast deui+sed
y^ shame of thyne own house. The ve|ry
stones of the wal, shal cry out of it. O
how doth our sauiour Christ thunder a|gainst
y^ rich worldlings, y^ liue al in plea+sure,
 yet are not once moued w^t pytie 
co~passio~ toward y^ pore?. vi. Wo be to you, y^
ar rich (saith he) which haue your co~sola|cio~.
Wo be to yu y^ are filled, for ye shal
ho~ger. Wo be to you y^ laugh now, for ye
shal mourne  weepe. Thus se we what

vnmercifulnes reigneth in the world al|most
vniuersally. And how al the threat|ninges
of Gods ve~geau~ce can not que~ch
in y^ wicked worldlynges hartes y^ insa|ciable
thyrst of gathering worldly good|des,
but that they go styl for the to heape
vp thycke claye agaynst the~selues, yea 
that beyond al measure, not consideringe
how vaine  deceatful y^ possessio~ of tem|poral
thinges is in this worlde. He hea|peth
treasure vpo~ treasure,Psal. xxxi. saith Dauid,
 yet knoweth he not for who~ he gathe|reth
these thinges to gether. Notable is
the histori y^ our sauiour Christ telleth of
a certaine rich ma~ in y^ Gospel of.Luke. xii. s. Luke
The grownd of a certaine rich ma~, saith

thought win him selfe, saying: what shal

I do. I wyl destroy my barnes,  buylde

Refuse not y^ praier of one y^ is in trouble
tourne not away thy face fro~ the nedye.Eccle. iiii.

the co~pany of y^e poore, humble thy soule
vnto the elder, and bow downe thy head
to a man of worship. Let it not greue the
to bowe downe thine eare vnto y^e poore,
but paye thy debte, and geue hym a fre~d|li
answer,  that with mekenes. Deliuer
hym that suffereth wronge fro~ y^e hand of
y^e oppressour,  be not faint harted, whe~
thou fyghtest in iudgeme~t. Be merciful
vnto the fatherles as a father, and be in
steade of an husband vnto theyr mother,
so shalt thou be as an obediente sonne of
the hiest,  he shal loue the more then thy
mother doth. Helpe the poore for y^e com|maundementes
sake, and let him not go
emptie fro~ the, because of hys necessitie.
Lese thy money for thy brother  neigh|bours
sake,Eccle. xxix. and bury it not vnder a stone
wher it rusteth  corruptih. Gather thy
treasure after the commaundeme~t of the
hyest,  so shal it bryng the more profitte

of the poore,  it shal kepe the from al y|uyl.
A mans almes is a purse wyth him,

that is the ryght thanke offeringe.

Loke what thine hand is able, geue w^t a

Geue almes of thy goods,  turne neuer
thy face fro~ the poore,  so shal it come to

if y^ haue litle, do thy dilige~ce gladlye to

Whyle we haue tyme, let vs do good

The bread of y^ nedy is y^e life of y^e poore he

If both y^ godly  vngodly rich wolde et
these se~tences before y^ eyes of their mind

For the~ wold not y^ rich me~ so gredily gri+pe

nor so niggardli kepe the~ after they haue

their fermes, by taking fines, bi receaui~g
great incomes, nor yet bi putting y^ pore

out of their houses, and sufferynge the te+neme~tes
to faul downe, as they do nowe,
then wolde not the ryche worldlynges
ioyne ferme to fearme,  heaue other men
out of their lyuinges, as they do nowe.
Then wolde not many of oure spirituall
ministers lyke insaciable wolues, gett so
mani ecclesiasticall promocio~s into their

lyuynge and that sufficient, be contente,

haue no regard to y^ poore  to their

mutter in corners  grudge against y^ rich
y^e pore breake y^e bond of peace, y^ pore rune
hedlong into al kynde of myscheif, which
thing we of late haue sene vnto our great
sorow, trouble  disquietnes, yea some of
y^ pore misers for lack of bodeli sustenau~ce

fal to pyckyng, robbing, stealyng  mur|thering
of other, some kyl, drowne, hang
them selues, because they do not present|ly
se how they may be able to fede the~ sel|ues,
their careful wiues, their lamentable
childre~,  their altogether wretched fami+ly,
wishing rather thorow desperacio~ des+peratly
to ende this their nedy, careful 
wery life, then so to much wretchedly for
to liue. Oh what good man is not moued
wyth pytye to heare, se, and knowe these
thynges? Yea what good man thyn|keth
not hym self bounde euen of duty to
healpe vnto the redresse of these inconue|nie~ces,
yea pestilences? they are enemies
to God, to ma~, to y^ contrey, to y^e publyke
weal, to our posterity, yea to heaue~  ear+the,
which walowing in al kind of weal|the
like Ethysh Epicures,  liuing al in
pleasure lyke effeminat Sardanapalus,
 heaping y^ goodes of y^ world togyther
as though they should neuer he~ce depart
are nothynge moued w^t the miseryes of
y^ poore miserable people. Wo be to that
gloton, whych enfarcing hys own stinc|kyng
 draffesaked belly with al kynd of
plesure  deintie dishes, suffreth his pore
nedy neighbour to perish for ho~ger. Wo
be to y^t couerous ca~kred churle, which so
ioyneth house to house  lande to land, y^
the poore ma~ knoweth not, wher to hyde
his head, nor how to lyue. Wo be to that
wicked worldling, which deckinge hym

self gorgiously w^t sumtuous apparel, suf|fereth
his poore Christe~ brother to go na+ked,
 to die for cold. Wo be to that riche
rauening raker, which hath raked toge|ther
ple~ti of worldly goodes,  yet is vn|merciful
to y^e nedi me~bers of Christ. Wo
be to y^ benificed ma~, which hauing wher+of
to cherish y^ pore of his parish, is abse~t
fro~ his benifice nothing caring what be+co~meth
of the~, so y^t he may liue pleasa~tly
 wealthely of y^ sweat of other me~s bro|wes.
Yea  wo be to al the~, which beyng
able to healpe y^ nede of y^ nedi,  to relife
y^e misery of the miserable, refuse to do it.
Great is their da~nacio~. But forasmuche
as euery ma~ godly affected is by y^ order
of charitie for his power bou~d to seke 
furder a redresse in thinges y^ are amisse.
I for my part considering y^t nothyng in
this world disquieteth a ma~ more the~ pe~|siue
care  careful pe~siuenes for a liuing
(if not tomuch, yet co~uenie~) co~sideryng
also how many inco~modities do chau~ce
to a ma~, y^t is co~tinualli vexed w^t greuous
thought taking for y^ prouisio~ of y^ belly,
I thought it good to gather togither, as
time hath suffred, certain se~te~ces  histo|ries
of y^ holy sciptures, which declare 
setforth vnto vs y^ vnmesurable bou~tie 
exceding large liberaliti of god toward
al the~ y^ cast their care on him,  trauaile
according to their vocacio~  calling, y^ bi
reading or hearinge of the~, the weake in
fayth may waxe stro~g in faith,  be fully

perswaded, that y^ god which nourished
the~ in their mothers wo~be, wil not leaue
the~ now socourles whe~ they be able tho|row
his grace to cleu vnto his promises,
to cal vpo~ his name,  for their power en+deuout
the~ selfes bi one honest gol mea+nes
or other, to get their liuing, euer cast+ing
their care on God,  yet not beynge
idle, but laboring in their vocacio~ accor|ding
to gods good wil  pleasure. I dou+bte
not, but if they dilige~tly weigh  ear+nestly
po~der these co~fortable se~tences 
histories of y^ holy scripture, thei shal not
only cease to atte~pt any vnlawful mea|nes,
but thei also shal find great quietnes
procure much reast to their myndes,  so
lo~g as they liue, liue w^t a meri co~science.
If I had bene as able to redresse y^ mise|rable
state of y^ pore w^t worldly goods, as
my wyl is to stay their co~sciences w^t the
word of God, y^ they may not despaire of
a liuing, I wold haue bene as redy to do
the one, as I haue labored to do y^ other.
But seing froward fortun goth forward
to frowne vpo~ me,  daily ceaseth not to
pearse me w^t y^ cruel dartes of pouerti, I
must do y^t I mai, whe~ I mai not y^t I wol+de,
laughing folish fortun to scorne w^t al
her vanities,  pleasures, thincking my
self sufficie~tli rich, solo~g as I haue such a
lord,Romay. x. as is ple~teously rich for so many as
cal on him solo~g as thorow gods grace I
am endued w^t this faith to beleue y^t while
I trauayle in my vocacion for my power

according to Gods wyl, I shal want no
good thing, y^t is necessary for the eyther
couering or feding of this my mortal bo|dye.
And wold God al me~ coulde so quiet
the~ selues,  with Democritus the Phi|losopher
laugh thys foolish worlde w^t al
y^ voluptuous worldlings to scorne, or w^t
the blessed Apostle euen fro~ y^ very harte

y^e poore people, vnto y^e notable ex|ample
of al rich me~, specially of suche as
professe y^ Gospel,Grosse Gos|pellers. wherof many in these
our daies, alas for pitie, haue y^ Gospell
swi~ming in their lips,  yet in their dee|des
liue no part of y^e Gospel, but abuse y^e
name therof to cloke their beastli liuing
 to shadow their carnal liberti, thei the~
selues being y^e bond slaues of Satha~, fur+ther
fro~ y^ true faith the~ the very Turkes
and Iewes, more estraunged fro~ al god|ly
workes, both of fastinge, praiyng, ge|uyng
of almes, mortifiyng their carnall
affectes. c. then the very papistes, so co|touse,

proud, haeful, vain glorious, diss|blyng,
bankeryng, liynge, sclaundering,
disdainefull, vncharitable, vnmercifll,
wicked, and vncleane in conuersacion,
that I know not to whom I may iustlie
compare them. They professe that they
know god,Tit. . as S. Paule sayth, but with
their dedes they vtterly deny him, being
abhominable, bisobediente, and wholye
straunged from al good workes. What
shal we the~ loke for, but (except we repe~t
and emende) eue~ as Christ did prophecie,Math. xxi.
the kingdom of god shal be take~ from vs,
and geuen to a nacion, which shall bring
forth y^ frutes therof. He loued not bles|sing,
therfore it shal be far fro~ him,Psal. xix. saith
Dauid. This vnthankefulnes towarde
gd, this vnmercifulnes towarde oure
neighbour, this dissolucio~ of lyfe toward
our selues, can by no meanes scape vnpu+nished.
The Lord haue merci vpo~ vs, and
turne our hertes,. that we may serue him
in holines and righteousnes al the daies
of oure lyfe.
God whiche hathe begonne a good

not one, sayth Dauid. The lord lo+ked
doune fro~ heaue~ vpon the chil+dren
of men, to se if there were any
y^t wold vndersta~d  seke after god.
But thei are al gone out of y^ way,
they are altogether become abho|minable,
ther is none y^t doth good,
no not one. And althoughe euerye
christe~ herte beholding this moste
vngodly state of the worlde ca~ not

vsed in these our daies, and
right hertelye be sorie, y^t the ares

that vice doth so abound that ver+tue
can take no place, y^t sinne hath
so ouerflowed the whole worlde, y^
true godlies is not onlye neglec|ted
and contemned, but also hissed

traiterous co~spiracies and hellike
co~mocions,surreccions  co~moci|, come o  Deuyll. which we of late haue
seene, wherwith also the comune

weale of England hath both bene
disturbed, defaced, and greatly en|pouerished,
who except an enemie
to al good order, sorowfully sorow+th
not? Who if not an aduersary
to our successio~ with large teares
lamenteth not? The inferiour me~|bers
to enuie the principall partes

The seruaunte to rule the

his gouernour? O comberous co~|fusion.
The brainsicke, yea rather
the brainles head to atte~pt redres
of matters in a comon weale, vn|sent,
vncalled? O preposterous or+der.


Christo.
It can not de denied
but diuers of y^e comons haue gone
far beyond their limites,  take~ in
hand that hath not become them,
for asmuch as thei co~trary to

Ye know ryght wel, y^ whe~ god de+termined

The.
Ye sai trut


Phi.
Here was Moses
chosen and appointed of god to be
the supreme magistrate and prin|cipal
gouernour of gods people.

And as he had here by gods com|maundeme~t
authoritie to rule, eue~
so were the Israelites bounde by
gods worde to obey, which thinge
so long as they did, they ryght wel
prospered, they liued quietly, god
fauored them, Moses as a louing
father cherished the~. But whe~ thei
shoke of the yocke of obedience,
sought carnal libertie, murmured
against their magistrate, troubled
the comon weale, oh how did god
punishe and plage the~? The lorde
hath heard your murmurings sai|eth
Moses, which ye murmure a|gainst
him. For what are wee (he
speaketh of him selfe and Aaron)
your murmuri~ges are not against
vs, but against the lorde. The Is|raelites
murmuring against Mo+ses,
murmured against god, whose
officer Moses was. Therfore say|eth
the scripture, behold the coun|tenaunce
of the lorde was moued

against the people  the lorde fiue
the people w^t an exceading greateNume. xi.

heauy wrath of god came vpo~ the~

and smot doune y^ chosen men that
were in Israel. For ther is no pow+er,
sayth S. Paul but of god,Rom. xiii. the
powers y^ be, are ordeined of god.
Whosoeuer therfore resisteth pow+er,
resisteth the ordinaunce of god.
But thei that resist, shal receiue to
them selues da~nacion.Nume xi. With how
greuous and horrible leprosy did
god stryke Mir Iam for murmu|ring
against Moses? How plaged
god y^ Israelites for murmuringeNum. xxii.
against him  Moses his seruau~t
with fyrie serpentes, which stonge
them vnto death? Corah, Dathan
and Abirom, because they did not
obeie Moses goddes magistrate,Num. xvi
but disdained that he shuld reigne
ouer them, although appointed of

god, wer they not swalowed vp of
the earth bothe they, their wyues,
their children,  al theyr goodes?
Went not they,  al that they had
doune alyue vnto hell,  the earth
closed vpon the~, and they perished
from among the co~gregacio~?


Chri
A mete plage for rebellio~.


Phi.
On
the morow after when the people
of Israel murmured against Mo+ses,
saying: ye haue kylled the peo|ple
of the lorde,  so vnreuerently
rayled on him, what, escaped they
vnpunished? The scripture sayth,
there dyed in that plage .xiiii.M.
and .vii. hundred, besides the~ that
dyed about the busines of Corah.
Thus se we, that in y^ beginninge
of the Israelites publyke weale,
god by no meanes could abyde re+bels
 sedicious persons, but pu|nyshed
them with moste horrible 
notable plages.


Eus.
If god so gre+uouslye
plaged the~ which dyd but

murmure against his magistrate,
how extremely wyl he punishe the~
y^ do not onely vncuere~tly speake
of the hye powers,Take heade ye rebels but also gather
vnlawful assembles against them
and enarme the~ selues on such ma+ner,
as though they shulde ryse a|gainst
a como~ pestile~ce of the pub+lyke
weale? Surely y^e ende of such
must nedes be tomuche miserable.


The.
These thinges were done to
shew how greatly god approueth
the office  dignitie of a lawefullNote
magistrate,  that he wyl be auen+ged
of al suche as despise his holy
ordinaunce, agayne y^ we by these
examples maye learne to feare the
hye powers, to honoure and obey
them, and by no meanes to resiste
them, excepte wee wyll proue the
same or worse plages.

Theo.
An
ende worthy of such a beginninge.


Phil.
What shall I rehearse vnto
you the histories of the .ii. sedici|ous
men, Theudas and Iudas of
Galile,tes. v. of whom blissed Luke wri|teth
in his booke of the Apostels
actes? The one boasted to do great
thynges, and so allured much peo+ple
to folowe him, the other coun|celled
the Iewes by no meanes to
paye tribute to Cesar, but to main+taine
theyr olde liberties, and by
this meanes moued great sedicion
amonge the people. What became
of the~? were they not put to death,
and so many as folowed them ey|ther
sayne, or els scatered abroad,
and so brought to naughte? Wee
reade not in al the scriptures, that
any traytour or notable sedicious
parson hathe at any tyme escaped
wythout notable punyshmente.
God ca~ not suffer his magistrates

to be disobeied, his co~mon weales
to be disturbed, his polltique or ci+uile
lawes to bee contemned, hys
godly and honest orders to be bro+ken.
c. Who soeuer attempteth a|ny
such wickednes, god wyl be a|uenged
of him, as it is euident not
only in the holy scriptures, but al+so
in the prophane histories. For
god, euen among the Heathen can+not
abyde his ordinaunce to be dis+pised.


Chri.
Wold god that al they
which eyther were authors of sedi+cion,
or consented therunto at any
time in this our realme, had know+en
these thinges, then wolde not
they so greatly haue forgotte~ the~
selues and theyr duetie.


Euse.
If
they had ben as wel trayned vp in
learning suche godly histories, as
thei were ouseled in hearing po|pishe
masses,  such other trifeling
tru~pery, thei had raised vp no such
tragedies. If there had bene but

the tenth part of true and learned
preachers, y^ there were of popyshe
priestes among them, they had ne+uer
fallen to such disorder. But it
is truly sayd of the wiseman,. xxvi. whe~
the preaching of gods worde fay|leth,
the people runne out of order,
perishe and come to naught.


The.
Yet haue I heard it reported that
these new preachers,Prechers. as they call
them, thorow their vndiscrete ser|mons,
opened a large window vn|to
dissolucion of lyfe, and by this
meanes caused the co~mon people
to aspire and breath vnto carnall
libertie, which whyle they hunted
they forgot bothe them selues and
theyr duetie.


Phil.
I wyl not excuse
al preachers. For some, as I haue
heard, haue taken vpon them the
office of preachinge vncalled, vn|sente,
and suche disordered prea|chers
for the mooste parte, brynge
all thynges to a disorder, yea to

an vtter co~fusion, maske they wyth
neuer so pleasaunt a visare, and ba+ble
wyth neuer so paynted elo|quence
in the syghte and eares of
the simple and ignorante people.
Howe shall they preache excepte
they be sente,Roma. x. sayeth Saint Paul?
I haue not sent the preachers, say|eth
the Lorde, and yet they runne.Iere. xxiii
I haue not spoken to them, and
yet they preached. But as I maye
speake in the faythefull and dis|crete
preachers behalfe, whyche
are lawfully sente of the hye pow|ers,
and called thereunto by the se|crete
mocion of goddes spirite in
theyr hertes, howe soeuer they be
reported, certaine I am they neuer
taughte suche doctrine, as should
minister occasion to godlye peo|ple
to shake of the zeale of obedi|ence,
or to breake any good order
or pollityke lawe.



Chri.
Yet haue I heard some prea+chers,
whom I knowe to be bothe
prudent and faythful, sclaundred,
that they by their preaching haue
caused these vproures.


Philem.
Ye
sayde well, sclaundred. Were they
preachers or rather massemu~gers,
that caused y^ insurreccions in De+uonshyre?


Chri.
Massemungers 
papites, as it is reported.


Phlem.
Then are the godly preachers fre
from geuinge any occasion of that
sedicion.


Euse.
But what of Nor|folke?


Phil.
Euen in Norfolke al|so
or els where, I am sure the veri
rebels them selues wyl confesse, as
I haue partly heard and knowen
that the preachers wer not the au+thors
nor prouokers of theyr com+mocion.
Can the sermons of them
which teache al obedience, humili|tie,
and paciene, moue men vnto
disobedience, hautines of mynde,
and desyre of reuenginge? Canne

lyght be the occasion of darkenes,
or truth of salsehead? But what is
so prudently, godly, and circu~spect
lie spoken, that enuy can not wrest
and corrupt? Neither is it strau~ge
for the christe~ preachers to be mis|reported
of the voluptuous world
lynges and couetouse carles. How
earnest a setter forth of gods glo|rie
was the Prophet Elias,  yet
howe was he reported, not only of
the baser sort, but euen of the king
and of the Quene? Art thou he, sai+eth
Kynge Achab,iii. Reg. that troubleth
Israel? As though he shuld saye:
art thou he which thorow thine vn+discrete
and rashe sermons mouest
the people to sedicion, makest the~
disobedient to me theyr kynge and
to al my officers, causest them vn|lawfully
to assemble together, and
to make hauocke of all thinges?
But y^ Prophe boldly answered.
It is not I that haue troubled

Israell, but thou and thy fathers
house, in that ye haue forsaken the
co~maundementes of the lord, and
folowed the waye of Baall, as
though he should haue answered:
Doest thou O kynge, laye to my
charge, y^t I troubled thy realme,
which teache thy subiectes to obey
the in all those thy co~maundemen|tes
that fyghte not wyth goddes
worde? Then vntruly thou accu|sest
me. There is, I graunt, in thy
realme sedicion and muche hurlye
burly: what then? Impute not the
faute to me, but corie thy selfe on
the head,  saye: I my selfe and my
wycked progenitors, which haue
not te~dered the glorie of god, nor
loued to heare his blessed worde,
nor to maintaine y^e preachers ther+of, but rather haue slayne them
and folowed the way of that foule
Idole Baall, and nouryshed hys
priestes at oure owne table, and

haue not ruled the Realme wyth
such iustice and equitie, with suche
clemency aud gentlenes, as becom+meth
ryghteous and godlye ru|lers,
but haue polled and pylled
oure subiectes, oppressed the wid|dowes
and fatherlesse, receyued
brybes, condemned the gyltelesse
for gyftes, and shedde innocente
bloud lyke vnmercyful  Bocher|cyke
tirauntes, we, we are only the
occasion of al these tumultes, sedi|cions,
conspiracies. c. wherewith
thys my Realme at this prese~t is
so greatly dis quieted. As I maye
let pas the other Prophetes,Math. v whi|che
for their godly sermons sustey+ned
the like displesure at y^ world|ly
tirauntes handes, how was the
self master of truth, the wysedome
of the father, I meane Iesu Christ
our Lorde,. Pet.  in whose mouthe was
found no guyle, no disceate, hau|deled
for hys Sermons?

When they broughte hym before
Pilate,e. xxiii. dyd not his aduersaries 
accusers lay to his charge, that he
sowed sedicion among the people?
that he corrupted and peruerted
the commons wyth his doctrine,
that he forbad men to pay tribute
to Cesar, and that he sayd, he hym
selfe was Christ a kinge? How vn+iustly
Christ was here accused, the
holy scriptures aboundantly testi+fie.
How could he be the author of
sedicion, whyche came in to thys
world to make peace? How coulde
he corrupt and peruert the people
with his doctrine, when he taught
nothynge, but that whiche he had
hearde of his father? Can heaue~ly
thinges corrupt y^ mindes of mor|tal
men?th. xvii. xxii. Forbad he to pay tribute
to Cesar, which him self paied tri|bute
to Cesar  co~mau~ded other so
to do? Boasted he him selfe a king
which ed away from the people,

when they wolde haue made hym
theyr kyng?Iho. vi. Sayd he not vnto Pi+late,
my kyngedome is not of this
world?Ihon. viii. Was he disobedient to the
temporal rulers,Math. xvii. whych disdayned
not to be brought before them, to
be iudged of the~, yea and to suffer
death vnder them?ctes. vi. Moreouer was
not the blessed martyr. S. Steue~
accused y^ he spake blasphemouse
wordes against Moses  against
god? when of God no man euer
spake more godlye, nor of Moses
more reuerently. Yet must Steue~
to the pot, and be condemned for
an heritike, whe~ Steuen deserued
rather praise and promocion. But
Steuen had offended inoughe, se|ynge
it was the chief priestes plea+sure,
 the other rauening rabines,
that Steuen shulde lyue no lon|ger.
Agayn when .s. Paule  Si|las
came to Tessalonica,Actes. xvii. and .S.
Paul preached in the sinagoge the

passion  rsurreccion of Christe,
howe dyd certeyne of the Iewes
complain of them vnto the heades
of the Citie, and rushed into the
house of Iason thapostels hoste,
and violentlye plucked him oute,
saiynge: These that trouble the
world are come hither also, whom
Iason hath receiued priuelie. And
these al do contrarie to the decrees
of Cesar, affirming another kinge
one Iesus. Here are thapostels ac+cused
both of sedicion and treason,
and yet wer they neither sedicious
persons nor traitours. They trou+bled
not y^ world, except the world
here be taken for the deuelishe peo+ple
of y^ world, to who~ it is a trou+ble
to hear any thing of Christ, or
to heare their abhominable liuing
rebuked. The good people of the
world, they quieted  made the~ me+ry
in their co~science,phe. ii. olo. i. for asmuch as
they perswaded by y^e word of god,

which thapostels preached, y^ they
had gotte~ fre remisio~ of al their sin+nes
thorow faith in Christes blud.
Thapostels did not co~trary to the
decrees of Cesar, if they were not
against goddes worde, but rather
taught me~ to obei the~. And though
thei preached Iesus to be a kyng,
yet dyd this nothing derogate Ce+sars
honor, for they taught Christ
not to be a temporal, but a spiritu|al
king, not to rule with sweard or
polare, but with his spirit  word,
not to reigne in Princes palaces,
but in the hertes of the faythfull.
Is not here great sedicion, greate
treaso~?Acte. xxi. Whe~ .s. Paul was but sene
at Hierusale~ in the temple how cri+ed
the iewes out, saiyng: O ye men
of Israel, help: this is the ma~ that
teacheth al me~ euery wher against
the people,  he law  this place,
 viole~tly drue him out of y^ te~ple,
 him,  wold haue slaine him

if the hye captaine had not come.
What had Paule offended? He
spake nothing, he did nothing, bu
as other Iewes dyd. It was
inough to kyll Paule, because he
was that Paule which had prea|ched
Christ to be the sonne of god.
At another time when he tolde the
Iewes, that god appointed hym
to be a teacher of the Ge~tils, how
lifted they vp their voices, saiyng.
Away wyth such a felow from the
earthe,Actes. xxi. for it is no reason that he
shoulde liue. Paule muste dye,
because at the co~maundement of
god he turneth the Gentiles from
Idolatry to the true worshipping
of god. And as the wycked world
linges cruelly entreated the Apo|stels
of Christe, so doe the worldly
tirauntes ha~dle the good byshops
and faythful ministers in the pri|mitiue
churche. If any myschiefe,
plage, or euyl chaunsed in the con|ey

wher thei wer, it was straight
ay layd to their charge. Euen so
kewyse doth y^ world at this time
eal w^t the true preachers of y^ lor|es
worde. Dearth, famine, ho~ger,
lage, pestilence, battel, insurrecci|ns,
co~mocions, treasons, heresies,
Epicurisme, licencious liuing. c.
all is imputed to the preachers of
Christes gospell. They, they, and
one but they, are the occasion
of al that naught is, whe~ no kinde
of people is farther from doynge
harme to a co~mon weale the~ they,
neither doth a co~mo~ weale receiue
mo benefites of any man, then of
the godlye preacher. If the olde
worlde had hearde and obeyed the
sermons of Nohe, they had not pe+rished
with waters. If the Sodo+mites
and gomorianes had harke+ned
to the sermons of Loth,Gene. vii. ii. Pet. ii. they
had not ben consumed with raine,
fyre and brymstone from heauen.

If the Israelites had geuen eare
to the warninges of the ProphetsGene. xix.
they had not so ofte be plaged and
led awaye into captiuitie. If the
iewes had receiued the doctrine of
Christ and his Apostles, they and
their citie with all their posteritie
had not come to such a destruccio~.
But when the lord rayseth vp his
Prophets  preachers, to admo|nishe
y^ people of their wickednes,
and to exhort them to repe~taunce,
and yet they wyll not amende, but
cruelly entreat them, slaunder the~
persecute the~, kyl the~, then cometh
destruccion. The lord god of their
fathers,ii. Para. xxxv. sayth the scripture, sent to
them by his messengers, rising vp
betimes  sending, for he had com+passio~
on his people  on his dwel+linge
place. But they mocked the
messengers of god, and despised
his wordes and misused his Pro|phets
vntyl the wrath of the lorde

arose against his people,  tyl ther
was no remedy. And so broughte
he on them the kinge of Chaldes,
which siue their yong me~ with the
swearde in their holye temple, and
spared neither yongman, mayden,
olde man, nor him y^ stouped for
age.


Chr.
The scholer is not aboue
his master,Math. x. nor the seruau~te better
the~ his Lord. If y^e world hate you
saith Christ, ye know it hated me
before it hated you. If ye were of
the world, y^e worlde wold loue the
is his.Ihon. xiiii. But for asmuche as ye are
not of the world, but I haue chose~
you fro~ y^e world, therfore y^e world
hateth you.


Eus.
Preachers are co~+maunded
of god vnder pain of da~+nacio~
to tel the people their fautes
 yet if they rebuke couetousnes,
the~ the couetous worldlinges are
mad. If thei inuey against pride,
the proud are displesed. If they co~+demne
whoredome, whores, bau|des,
and rufianes are woode.

Looke what soeuer sinne they re|proue,
the gilty can not abide, but
maligne the preacher, and seeke to
do him displeasure. The Gerge|sens
had rather Christ shulde ne|uer
come amonge them, yea they
had rather go to the deuil, the~ thei
wold haue their filthy swine drou+ned.Math. vii.

Phile.
Well, thus se ye it is
no new thing for godly preachers
to be sclaundred  burdened with
those fautes, wherein they be no|thinge
gylty.


Chri.
I haue heard it
reported, y^ diuerse Gentleme~ haue
ben y^ occasio~ of al these tumultes
and sedicions thorow the great op+pressions
and wronges that they
haue done to the , as
by making co~mon pastutes seue|rall
to them selues,Of gentlemen by enclosinge

more ground to their own vse, the~
heretofore hath bene accustomed,
and by this meanes take away the
necessary fode from the pore mens
cattell, without the which they can
not lyue: againe, by gettynge so
manye farmes in to their handes,
and letting out their owne landes
vnto their tenauntes and farmers
for so great pryce, or els take such
large fines and greate incommes,
that they ca~ neuer liue of it. These
 such lyke thinges haue I heard.


Phil.
Ye haue heard my mynde of
preachers, which were sclaundred
(I speake of the godly) in this be|halfe.
I wyl now speake sumwhat
of gentlemen. As I do not alowe
al that be called preachers, so do I
not approue the doinges of al the~
that be called gentlemen. And as
I do not condemne all preachers,
so do I not dispraise all gentleme~.
For as they are, whiche are trewe

preachers in dede, so lykewyse are
ther whiche are true gentlemen in+dede.
But some abuse the name of
preachers, by teaching papistrie, a
nabaptistry, Epicurisme, c.  are
no prechers in dede, but rather pra+ters
 deceiuers of the people: so
lykewise are ther many which are
called gentleme~,  are no gentleme~
in dede, but pollers and pillers, ra+kers
and catchers, bribers and ex|torcioners,
yea and very caterpil|lers
of the commo~ weale. For they
abuse the name of a gentleman,
whiche is vnfeynedlye a name of
muche worship and great honour,
and worthy to be had in reuerence
and hye estimacion. Wythout the
true gentlema~ the common weale
can no more safely be, then the bo|dye
wythout eyes. For as the eyes
are the principall coforte of an
whole bodye, so lykewyse are the
true gentleme~ of the co~mon weale.

And looke what the nose is with|out
smellynge, the tonge without
speakyng, the handes wythout fe|ling,
the feete without goynge, the
very same is a co~mon weale with|out
them that are true gentlemen:
as the wiseman sayeth.Prou. xi Where no
good councell is, there the people
decay, but where as many are that
can geue good counsell, there is
wealthe. For suche as are true gen+tlemen,
are fathers of the contrey,
mainteiners of the pore, defe~ders
of the widowes  fatherles, socu|rers
of y^e nedy, conforters of the co~|fortles,
 vpholders of the co~mon
weale, in fine, gentlemen bothe in
name  dede. These be pearles 
iuels to a realme,  as necessari for
the co~seruacio~ of a publike weale,
as fyre, water, and heate is for the
health of mans bodi. For their pri+cipal
respect is not vnto their own
priuat lucre,  singular co~moditie,

but their whole study is how they
maye profite the co~mon weale and
do good to many, as Salomo~ say+eth:
 the ryghteous laboreth to do
good, but the vngodlye vseth his
encrease vnto sinne. Not onli their
goodes, but theyr verye lyfe also
wyll they bestowe to do good to o|ther,
so farre is it of, that for their
owne aduauntage they wyl enpo|ueryshe
or hinder any man.


Euse.
Wolde god we had many such ge~+tlemen.


Phi.
We haue without all
doute many, although not so ma|ny
as I wolde wyshe, for of good
thinges we ca~ neuer haue inough.
Then is there another sort, which
glory in the tytle of gentlemen al|so.
And they are suche, as this co~|mo~
prouerbe noteth: As ryseth my
good, so ryseth my bloude. They
thinke al nobilitie to consist in the
abundau~ce of worldly goodes, in
wearinge of golden cheines, and

costly aparel, in hauing faire hou|ses
and pleasaunte gardens. And
to set forth this their gentlema~ry,
they poll they pyl, they wake they
ake, they sweate they freate, they
gripe thei nipe, thei face thei brase,
they semble they disse~ble, yea they
moue euery stonne, as they saye, to
maintaine and set forth their vn|noble
nobilitie, not caringe howe
they come by it, so they haue it. All
is fyshe that cometh to the nette:
it is good to be takinge. Bonus est
odor lucri ex re qualiber. These stu+dye
not as the true gentlemen do,
to profite many, to do good to the
contrey, to maintaine the poore, to
relieue y^ socurles, to nourishe the
weake, to cherishe their nedy tenau~+tes,
neither seke they the co~modity
of the co~mon weale, but their own
priuat aduauntage. They labour
to posses much,Eccle. iii but thei distribute
nothing. Their hande is stretched

out to receiue, but shut when they
shoulde geue. If they once exepe
in to a towne or vyllage, they for
the mooste parte neuer ceasse, tyll
they haue deuoured and eaten vp
the whole toune. What soeuer is
pleasaunte or profitable, muste be
theirs by hoke or by croke. It ly|eth
handsomlye for them  so nere
their nose, though it be a myle of.
If there be either farme or shepe|ground,
vpon the which some ho|nest
pore man liueth, both he and
his familie, oute he muste. Had it
must be whatsoeuer it cost, though
the pore man  all his should go a
begging, it lyeth so co~modiouslye
for our newecome gentleman. If
they bye any tenement,  let it out
againe to the pore man, O how do
they racke it, and stretche out the
rentes therof, almost from a peny
to a pounde? yea and some of them
biynge house and land in a toune,

suffer the houses to falle downe,
and turne the grounde vnto pa|sture,
the poore man not hauynge
where to hyde his head. Who wyl
be troubled, say they, wyth suche a
sorte of shake ragged slaues in a
towne, whiche do nothinge but
burne vp oure hedges, eate vp the
common, fyl the towne full of beg+gers
braules? Who? No man I
trowe, namely where such fine and
longnosed gentleme~ dwell. Some
biynge the lordeshyp of a towne,
handle the inhabitauntes thereof
on such sorte, that they lose diuerse
of theyr liberties, beynge in much
worse case then they were afore.
Thus y^e pore people be so wrou~ge
of these vngentle gentlemen, y^t the
selye soules are lyke vnto dry had|dockes.
Some Irishe men behol|dynge
them, myghte well thynke,
that they came latelye oute of
Saynte Patrickes pargatorye.

They are so wythered awaye euen
to the hard bones for colde and ho~+ger.
Agaynst suche churlyshe gen|tleme~
speaketh god by y^e Prophet,
saiynge: O ye heades of the house
of Iacob,  ye leaders of the house
of Israell:che. iii. Should not ye knowe
what were lawful and right? But
ye hate the good, and loue the euel,
ye plucke of mens skinnes and the
fleshe from their bones, ye eate the
fleshe of my people, and flaye of
their skinne, ye breake their bones
ye chop them in peces as it were in
to a cauldron, and as fleshe into a
potte.


Theo.
These gredy gripes,
and hongry horseleches, by vsur|pinge
the name of gentlemen, do
muche obscure the renowne, wor|ship
and honour of true gentleme~,
and cause the name of a gentlema~
to be muche disdained amonge the
co~mon people, as wee haue bothe
heard and seene now of late daies.

And thoughe they chalenge to the~+selues
neuer somuch the name of a
gentlema~, by their goodes, by their
auncestoures, by antiquitie, by the
worthines of their stocke, and ma|ny
god morowes, yet if they do de|generate
and growe out of kynde
from the natural maners of a true
gentleman, they are no gentlemen
in deede, but carles  churles, yea
and in hurtinge their neighbours
they are tirantes and murtherers,Eccle. xxxiiii.
as the holy scripture calleth them,Eai. i
and in pollyng and pyllyng them,Miche. ii.
they are theues,Sopho. iii. lions, and wolues
as the Prophetes terme them. An
ape shall be an ape, though she be
clad in purple and golde. Esops
crowe was styll a crowe, euen whe~
he had decked him selfe with the
pleasaunte and goodly fethers of
other byrdes.Te nobili It is vertue, and not
grosse fleshe  bloud, which thinge
we all are, that maketh the true, no+ble

and ge~tlema~. It is a minde dis+posed
to do good, yea  doth good
in dede when occasion serueth, and
not sumptuous aparell and golde~
cheines, that setteth forth true no|bilitie.
It is iustice, mercy, libera|litie.
kyndnes, gentlenes, hospita|litie
for the poore, and suche other
godly gyftes of the mynd, and not
the multitude of ryches, that de|clare
who is a gentlema~, and who
a churle, who is noble, who vn|noble.
He that can nyest approche
vnto lady vertue, and most liuelie
set forthe her naturall disposicion
in his conuersacion and behaue|oure,
he is the beste gentleman, be
his parentes neuer so base, and his
kinred neuer so vyle in the iudge|mente
of the worlde.


Christo.
So|crates
the Philosopher beholding
a man verye ryche and wealthy in
deede, but an assehead in the know+ledge
of goodnesse, and notwith|standynge

gorgeouse and galante
in apparell, sayde: Beholde a gol|den
slaue. Socrates nothynge e|stemynge
the ryche man for hys
ryches and sumptuous rayement,
called hym a golden slaue, mea|ninge:
that thoughe he were laden
wyth neuer so manye golden chey+nes,
golden rynges, golden appa|rell,
yet so longe as he hym selfe is
but fylthye in hys conuersacion,
and hathe a mynde subiecte to car+nal
lustes, as couetousenes, pryde,
ambicion.  cete, he is but a verye
slaue, so farre is it of that he is a
gentleman. At an other tyme that
same Philosopher seynge a man
bothe ryche and galauntlye appa+reled,
sayde: Here is a horse trap+ped
in syluer. Hys apparell shew+ed
hym to be a gentleman, but his
maners and condicions declared
hym to be but a horse and a beast.

Diogenes hearing a certeine man
bragging and boasting of his kin+red,
ryches, beautie, costuous apa|rel,
and such other worldly visars,
knowing not one pointe of nobili|tie
to be in him, nor ought els wor+thy
of prayse, sayde: loo, here is a
shepe with a golden flese. Cato the
elder was wont to saye, that the ly|tle
theues dyd weare fetters, but
the great theues went vp  doune
galauntly appareled with purple
and golde. I pas ouer diuerse o|ther
saiyngs of the wise me~, which
without any respect had to carnal
nobilitie, worldlye ryches, gorge|ous
aparell. c. called the wealthy
worldlinges, by suche names, as
theyr maners and behaueoure de|serued.


Euse.
Wolde god all they
which wyll be taken for gentleme~
were gentlemen in dede. Then
shulde it go much better with this
realme of England.


Christ.
Thys

endles encroching of worldly pos|sessions
shew euidently, y^ they whi+che
vse it are not frindlye to the co~|mon
weale, seing thorow it y^e poore
co~mons are brought to beggarie.
Salomon hath a notable saiynge
and wold god all men wold learne
it.Prou. xiii. It is this. The encrease  pro|speritie
of the comons, is the kyn|ges
honour: but the decaye of the
people, is the co~fusion of y^ prince.


Theo.
Frindely to y^e comon weale
Mary syr they are not frindlye to
the kynge by Salomons saiynge,
that enpouerysheth the comons: if
the comons encrease, wealth, and
prosperitie bee the honoure of the
kinge, and if the decaye and enpo|ueryshement
of the comons be the
confusion and destruccion of the
prynce, then are they extreme ene|mies
to the kynge, which without
any respect had to the como~ weale,
seke thorow their vnsaciable coue+tousenes

to beggare the Kynges
subiectes, whereby they shall be
the lesse able bothe to serue the
kynge, and to beare for their por+cion,
the charges of the Realme,
when tyme requireth.


Philemon.
Certes a Kynge can ne+uer
be poore, so longe as hys sub+iectes
be wealthye. And better it
is to haue many that shuld healpe
in tyme of nede, then fewe, and easi+er
is the burthen and the gladlier
it is borne y^t many beare then few.


Christo.
If that same gentlenes
and liberalitie were found at this
present amonge the ryche men of
this worlde, that hath bene here to
fore in men of lyke degre, the com+mons
shulde not only at all times
be quiet, but also the realme shuld
floryshe wyth greate wealthe, yea
and that vniuersallye, where as
nowe it resteth in fewe mens han+des.
Gentlemen to be enchrochers

of Farmes, notable shepemon|gers,
Grasirs, Bochers, Clothi+ers,
Weauers, Brewers. c. as I
maye speake nothyng of theyr par+sonages,
vicarages, prebendes. c
hauynge otherwyse whereof abun+dantly
to lyue? O vnworthy acte.
O vnsemely syght. O abhomina+cion.
What is it to beggare the
Realme, to famyshe the Kynges
subiectes, to brynge slauery in to
thys realme, if thys be not? Do
they not sucke the poore mennes
bloud, that suffer them not to haue
whereof to lyue? The wyseman
sayeth:Eccle. xxxiiii. The breade of the nedy is
the life of the poore, he that defrau+deth
him of it, is a murtherer.


Philemon.
Well neyghboures,
althoughe I doubte not, but that
the Kynges maiestie and his most
honorable councel wyll se redresse
in these thynges when they haue

conuenient leasure, yet if the world
shulde go forth  continue as it is,
 the ryche worldlinges more mi+serably
oppresse the pore then they
heretofore haue done, god forbyd
that the como~ people, or any kynd
of people shuld reise vp tumultes,
styrre vp sedicions, lyfte vp their
hande againste the hye powers.
For that is a sinne, whiche by no
meanes can escape vnplaged, yea
they that so do, runne into the dau~+ger
of eternall damnacion, as ye
haue heard afore.


Chri.
I say god
forbyd also: but ye know the come
prouerbes, the belli hath no eares,
honger is sharper then thorne, ne+cessitie
is an harde darte, nede ma+keth
the olde wyfe trot.


Philem.
Saint Paule had rather neuer toRom. xiiii . viii.
eate fleshe nor drinke wyne, then
he shuld offend his weake brother
Wolde he then thinke you, trou+ble
an whole comon weale, make

vproures, rayse vp commocions,
come armed in the felde, assemble a
sorte of idle braines and brainles
people together, robbe mens hou|ses,
spoyle their goodes, breake vp
their hedges, make seuerall pa|stures
co~mon to all men, hunte car+nal
libertie, make a co~munion, yea
conusion of al thinges, and al for
the belly? Paule woulde rather
lyke vnto the pore Lazar haue dy+ed
for honger,Luke. xvi. then once violently
and vniustly to take awaye other
mens goodes.


Chri.
Ye se the vn|mercifulnes
of y^e riche, what, wold
ye haue the pore people starue for
honger?


Phil.
Rather starue and
die for honger as pore Lazar dyd,
then to trouble a co~mon weale. As
riches, so likewise pouertie cometh
from god: And both are to be take~
thankefully, and not to be grud|ged
at. If oppression be done to
the pore of the ryche worldlinges,

shall they auenge them selues?
God forbyd, yea rather take that
crosse paciently, and thynke that
they haue deserued far worser thin+ges,
whiche haue so ofte deserued
hell, and pray to god to geue those
ryche men mercifull hertes, that
accordinge to their dutie they may
be moued with pytie and compassi+on
toward the pore. Againe if they
haue iniuries done vnto them, if
they can not otherwise be redressed
let them complayne to the Magi|strates
and officers of the commo~
weale, whyche are appointed to
heare mennes causes.


Christo.
If
the poore oppressed complayne to
the Iustices of peace or suche lyke
in the contrey where he dwelleth,
that hathe the iniurye done vnto
hym, lytle redresse, as I heare, can
be hadde, one so serueth anothers
turne, euen as the Mules scratche
one anothers backe.



Philemon.
If there be anye suche
parciall officers, whyche are not
indifferente, but iudge for fauour,
yet remayneth there another re|fuge,
and that is, to complaine vn+to
the Kynges Maiestie and hys
moste honorable councell, whyche
wythoute all doubte wyll bothe
gladlye heare theire lamentable
complayntes, and redresse theyr
matters accordinge to iustice. But
who so leaueth godly meanes, and
attempteth wycked wayes, bothe
he and his enterprise muste nedes
come to naught, as we haue seene
of late dayes.Math. xxv. The lorde hym selfe
hath spoken it. All they that take
the sweard, shall peryshe with the
swearde. All they that are priuate
menne, and go aboute wyth force
and violence to auenge theyr own
cause, and to redresse theyr owne
matters, shall surelye come vnto
destruccion.

For they be order breakers and de+spisers
of goddes holy ordinau~ce,
which hath appointed magistrats
and head rulers iustly to iudge be+twene
man and man in al matters
of controuersie, that peace and qui+etenes
may be maynteined in a co~+mon
weale.


Theo.
If men wer chri+sten
men in dede, as they professe
in word, they wolde neuer for the
bellies sake go aboute to disturbe,
trouble, and disquiet all the mem|bers
of the bodie. There is a pro|uerbe
no lesse true then common,
God neuer made mouthe, but he
made meat. And truly I am thus
perswaded, that god, which made
me a liuing soul, and fed me in my
mothers wombe, wyl not, after he
hath brought me in to this world,
suffer me to peryshe for honger, if
I hange on his fatherlye proui|e,
cast my care on hym, seke to
please hym, and liue in my vocaci|on

according to his worde.


Phil.
I
am glad neybour Theophile this
to heare you speake: for as I may
tel you truth, the principall occasio~
whi I so greatli desire to speake w^t
you  wyth my other neyghbours
here, was to confort and strengthe~
you againste this sollicitude and
thought taking for the belly, wher+wyth
manye at this presente are
muche vexed. For I am not igno+rant
what importune suer the bel+lye
is, and how she is euer crauing
and castyng doutes, fearinge that
she shuld neuer haue inoughe, and
therfore continually knocketh at
the doore of the mynde, to putte
him in remembraunce to prouide
for her, saiyng: Adfer, Infer, bring
hither, bringe in. For the idle belly
continuallye consumeth, wasteth,
but getteth, prouideth nothinge.
Therefore is she full of thoughte
and care for her liuynge, euen as a

beggare is, whiche is so ielouse o|uer
hys drynke, that he wyll not
suffer the lytle flye to sitte vpon
the brymme of his cuppe, leste she
should beguyle him of his drinke.
Thys belly care causeth the Law+ers
to corrupte the lawe, the iudge
to geue false sentence, the officers
to be vntrue to their Lordes and
masters, the Hipocrites to corrupt
the holy scriptures, the ryche men
to be vnliberall, vnmercifull, the
Beneficed menne to receyue much
and distribute lytle, the Patrones
of benefices, to sell to vnlear|ned
Priestes theyr benefices, pa|rentes
to sell theire chyldren lyke
calues and sheepe for money, the
papiste to hate the truthe of god|des
worde, the marchaunte to for
sweare hym selfe in sellynge hys
marchandise, the craftes manne to
make and vtter false and sleyghty

wares, the temporal Lord to raise
hys rentes, or to take greate fines
and incommes, the Ine kepers
to polle and pylle hys geastes, the
seruaunte to robbe his master, the
mayde her masters, the syngle or
maried woman to pley the whore,
the syngle or maryed manne to
playe the Rufian, and the thiefe,
the subiecte to ryse agaynst his su+perioure.
c. Innumerable euels
dothe thys belly care brynge vnto
menne, againste the whyche except
they be well furnyshed both wyth
strong fayth in goddes holy proui+dence,
and also fortressed wyth the
knoweledge of holye scriptures,
wherein lye buryed so greate con|solacions
for the faithful, they can
not abide y^ importune  continual
futes of the sluggyshe bellye, but
must nedes dispaire of satisfiynge
her requestes, and by this meanes

not only haue an vnquiet mynde,
but also throwe them selues into
desperacion, and so to muche wret+chedly
finishe this their careful life


Chri.
Thys bellye care withoute
doute is a great temptacio~ to ma~,
and very muche disquieteth hym,
namely when he seeth all thynges
so dere as thei be now, and despair
of a redresse, for asmuche as they
which shuld amende thys thynge,
are the cause of this dearth and fa+mine,
I speake of Grasiers, Shep
mongers, and riche famers. Ther+fore
neyghbour Philemon, ye can
not intreate at this present in your
communicacion amonge vs of a
thing more mete for this beggerly
and nedy wretched tyme, then to
declare vnto vs by the holy scrip|tures,
how mercfull and bounte|ous
lde we haue in heauen, whi|che
wyll not suffer vs to peryshe
for honger, if we hange on his fa|therly

prouidence, and cast al oure
care on hym.


Phil.
Thys your be~te
good wyl to heare, doth not a litle
encourage me to speake that whi|che
I haue purposed, yea and that
in fewe wordes, because I wyl not
be tedious vnto you.


Eusebius.
Speake I pray you, we wyl geue
good eare.


Phil.
That ye maye be
thorowly perswaded of goddes li|beralitie
toward his faythfull ser|uauntes,
I praye you fyrst of all
consider gods order in the prouisi+on
for hys creatures. Before god
made man, whom he was determi|ned
to make the hygh ruler vnder
him ouer al thinges in this world,
he made and prepared euery thing
necessarye for him, and for the con|seruacion
of his bodie, y^ he might
abundantly haue, what soeuer is
expedient for hym, and by no mea|nes
peryshe for honger and lacke
of foode. Fyrst placing hym in pa+radise

that garden of pleasure, he
gaue man libertie to eate of al the
frute that grew in the garden,Gene. ii. ex|cept
the tre of knowledge of good
and uel. After the transgressio~ of
gods co~maundement, when man
was iustly driuen out of paradise,
and worthye for his disobedience
not only to starue for honger, but
also to be conde~ned for euer, if god
for his mercies sake, promised in
that blessed sede Christ Iesu, had
not fauored  forgeuen him.Gene. iii. God
sending forth man into this vale
of misery, dyd not leaue him con|foles
and without prouision for
his bodelye sustenaunce, neyther
sente he him into a bareyn, deserte
or alte grounde voyde of all
frute, but into this worlde, where
he founde plentye and aboun|daunce
of all thynges, and gaue
him libertie to eate of all frutes
and seedes growynge in it. En|crease,

saieth he, and multiplie and
replenishe the earthe, and subdue
it and haue dominion of the fyshe
of the sea,Gene. i. and the foule of the ayre
and of euerye liuinge thinge that
moueth vpon the earthe. And god
sayde: Beholde, I haue geuen you
euery hearbe, sowinge seede, which
is in the vpper face of al the earth,
and in euerie tree in the whiche is
the frute of the tree, and that sow|the
seede, that they maye be meate
vnto yo. Wyth thys kynde of
foode was Adam and his posteri|tye
contente vntyll the floude of
Nohe. After the floude, God pur|posinge
as it were, to repayre man
kinde, and to be mannes good and
merciful lorde,  no lesse but much
more bounteous to hym, then he
was aforesayed: bringe ye forth,
and multiplye and replenyshe the
earth.Gene. i The fear of you,  the drede
of you shall be vpon euery beaste

of the earth, and vpon euerie foule
of the ayer, and in all suche as the
earth bringeth forth, and in all the
fyshes of the sea, into your hande
are they deliuered. Euery thynge
that moueth it self, and that liueth
shal be meate for you. Euen as the
grene hearbe, haue I geuen you
al thinges. As god afore gaue ma~
libertie to eate al kynde of herbes,
sedes, and frutes that grow vpon
the earth, so likewise geueth he ma~
authoritie nowe to eate all kynde
of fyshe or fleshe as he lysteth.


Christ.
O exceadinge greate is the
liberalitie of our lorde god, which
dealeth so fauorablye wyth wret|ched
manne: Not onlye to geue
hym libertie to eate all kynde of
hearbes, seedes, and frutes, bu
also all maner of fleshe and fyshe.
This is with out doubte a singu+lare
benefite and greate token of
goddes inestimable goodnes to|warde

man.


Phi.
Here euen frome
the beginning and reparing of ma~
dothe the kyndenes of god braste
out and shew forth it selfe toward
man abundantly, so that nowe all
thynges are pure,Tit. i. to them that are
pure. Nothing is commune or vn+clean,
neither is any kinde of meat
to bee refused,i. Timo. iiii. if it bee taken with
thankes geuinge. For that which
god hath purified  made cleane,Actes. x.
ought no man to call vnpure, vn+cleane.
And all these thinges hath
god geue~ vs to eate. Now that ye
maye be thorowlye perswaded of
goddes truth in performinge hys
promises, call to remembrau~ce the
histories of the holye scriptures,
whiche do declare and euidentlye
proue,Psalm. xlv that god is faythfull in all
his wordes, and dealeth no lesse fa+uorablye
wyth his seruauntes in
dede, then he promiseth in worde.
GOD co~maunded Absolom to

get him out of his contrey and out
of his nacion,. xii. and frome hys fa|thers
house vnto a lande that he
woulde shewe hym. Abraham dyd
as the lorde commaunded him. If
Abraham had not bene fully per|swaded
of goddes constancie and
truthe in accomplyshing his pro|mises,
wolde he haue forsaken his
natiue contrey, and gone oute of
hys owne house, where he was qui+tely
placed and wealthily settled,
and wandered abrode lyke a ma|sterles
hounde, he can not tell whi+ther?


Eusebius.
A carnall and
worldlye wyse man woulde haue
thought it greate madnes to leaue
a thynge certeine, for that that is
vncerteyne.


Philemon.
So iudgeth the wyse|dome
of thys worlde,or. iii. whyche is
folyshenes afore God. Notwyth|standinge

of goddes promise, forsoke

of God. Neyther was he a|ny
thynge at all thereby impoue|ryshed.
The scripture sayeth, he
was very ryche in cattell, syluer,
and golde. For his natiue contrey,
God gaue hym a contrey that
flowed wyth mylke and honye,Gene. xiii
that is, wyth the abundaunce of
al thinges. For one house, he gaue
hym many houses. For one naci|on,
he made hym a father of many
nacions.Rom. iiii. So recompenseth God
the losses that any man susteineth
for hys sake.


Theophilus.
The lyke thynge is
promised of oure sauioure Christe
in the gospel. Ther is no ma~ saieth
he, that hath forsaken house,Luke. xviii. either
father or mother, either brethren,

or wyfe or children for the kynge+dome
of gods sake, which shal not
receiue muche more in this world,
and in the world to come, life euer
lastinge.


Phil.
Who euen by this
one exemple is not greatli encoura+ged
to beleue the promise of god,
and to be fully perswaded, that as
god dealte wyth Abraham, so in
lyke maner wyl he deale with vs
if we obey the voice of god, as A+braha~
did? For there is no respecte
of persons with hym, but in al peo+ple
he that areth hym  worketh
ryghteousenes, is accepted vnto
hym. The promise of god is vni+uersal.
Whosoeuer therfore laieth
hande on it wyth stronge fayth, he
shall haue of god, whatsoeuer he
hath promised. There is no diffe+rence
betwene the Iewe and the
Gentile,oma. x. el, ii. for one is lorde of all, whi+che
is ryche vnto all that cal vpon
him. For whosoeuer calleth on the

name of the Lorde he shall be safe.

It is not withoute a cause,

Phil.
Faith
is muche, yea faithe is altogether.
Whatsoeuer ye axe when ye praie,
saithe Christ beleue to haue it,Marke. x. and
ye shal haue it in dede: as god shew+ed
him self faithfull in his promise
to Abraham, whiche is the father
of the faythfull,Rom. iiii. so lykewyse did he
to other, because no man shoulde
doubte of his liberalitie, whych is
comune not to Abraham only, but
to all the faithefull in lyke ma~ner:
ye reme~ber y^t Hager was the hand
maide of Sara Abrahams wife 
because Sara hir self was barre~ Gene. xvi
childeles, she gaue to hir husbande
her maid to be his wife y^t she might

be edified by hir.

This Hagar
broughte forthe a sonne called Is|mael,
by hir master Abraham, whi|che
child was a mocker, in somuch
y^t after Sara had brought forthe
Isahac hir sonne,ene. xxi. she wold not suf|fer
neyther the lad nor his maister
to tari any longer in hir house, but
caused Abraham to put them both
oute.


Eusebi.
Ye saye truethe.


Phi.
Abraham rose vp earelye in the
morenynge, and toke breade and a
bottell of water and gaue it vnto
Hagar, puttyng it on hir shulders
with the ladde also, and sent hir a|way.
Nowe marc Hagar is put
oute of hir masters house wyth hir
childe. She knoweth not whither
to go. She hathe no house wherin
to hide her head, but wandreth vp
and downe in y^e wyldernes of Ber
Seba. To conforte her no man is
bente: For no man is presente. As

touching her vitaile, it is al spent.
The breade is eaten, the water is
drunke vp. There remayneth now
in sight no more but vtterly to des|payre
of soucoure, and miserablye
to dye. Which thinge Hagar con|sidering,
casteth the ladde Ismael
vnder a bushe, goeth her waye, and
sitteth on the other syde a greate
waye, as it were a bowe shote of,
because she wolde not se the deathe
of the chylde. Wyth howe great so+rowes
her herte was stuffed, wha
plentie of teares gushed out of her
eyes, what careful fayntenes occu|pied
her whole bodie, no man is a|ble
to expresse. A chylde to dye for
honger, the mother knowinge of
it, yea and as it were in her syghte,
in her bosome, O dolour vnspeake+able.
The mother lykewyse to bee
pearsed wyth the same darte, O in
comparable payne. Al thinges are
brought here to extreme desperacio~

There is no waye to escape this
present mischiefe. The childe cry|eth,
the mother wepeth: Both loke
for presente death. But what? Is
god vntrue, vniust, false in his pro+mise?
Stoppeth he his cares, that
he may not heare the lame~table co~+plaintes
of the to much wretched?
Despiseth he the teares of the mo|ther,
and the cryinges of the child?
Yea rather when no remedie is lo|ked
for, god is present,. on. xiiii. . god confor|teth,
god helpeth, because he wyll
be founde a god which is faythful
in all his wordes, whych is the self
trueth and can not lye, whiche lea|ueth
no ma~ socurles that calleth on
him. He sendeth his holye angel to
the miserable woma~, xxi. when no mor+tall
creature is present to help. He
conforteth her, and biddeth her not
feare: for god hath heard, saith he,
the voice of the chylde where he ly+th.
He sheweth her a well of wa|ter

to confort both her  her childe
withal, and afterwarde prmiseth
that the lad Ismaell shall be a no|ble
man, and greate multitudes of
people shall ryse of hym.

O

This is a confortable  plea|saunt
mirrour for all people to be|holde,
specially for them that are
maried, and yet se not (suche and so
great is theyr pouertie) howe they
maye bee able to noryshe them.
If the maried folke liue according
to their vocacion, and trauaile in
their estate in the feare of the lord,
though they haue neuer so manye
childre~ and great familie, yet shall
the sea soner be without water and
fyshe, and the land without grasse

perishe for honger. If god proui|ded

If the

Philemo.
In the dayes
of Isahac Abrahams sonne, there
fell a greate dearthe in the lande
where he dwelte, in so muche that
he remoued frome that place, and
tooke his iourneye towarde Abi|meleche
Kynge of the Philistines,Gene. xxv
euen vnto Gerer. And whyle he
was yet in hys iourney, god spake
vnto hym and sayde.

Go not doune into Egipte, but a|bide
in the land which I shal shew
vnto the, soieorne in this land, and
I wyl be wyth the, and wyll blesse
the. For vnto the and to thy sede, I
wyl geue al these contreis. Behold
goddes carefull prouidence for his
seruauntes. Isahac wyshing to es|cape
the cruell daries of honger,
hunteth aboute where he and hys
maye conuenie~tlye dwell. And ra|ther
then he wolde die for honger,
he after the example of his father
Abraha~,. xii. determineth to go doune
into Egipte. God which is able to
fede and to saue his people in eue|ry
place (for the earth is the lordesl. xxiiii.
and al that is conteined therin) for
biddeth Isahac to go doune into
Egipt, wylleth him to tary styll in
the contrey, and promiseth to blesse
hym, yea to geue to him and to his
sede, all the contreis of that lande.
Isahac obeying the voyce of god,

taried in that co~trey,  waxed exce|ding
myghty, wealthy  ryche. For
god gaue him greate abundaunce
of corne, of shepe, and of oxen, yea
wyth a myghtie household dyd the
lorde blesse hym, insomuch that the
kinge him selfe came vnto him, 
desired to make acouenau~t of peace
and amitie with him: vnto suche 
so great power was Isahac grow|en.
He which afore knew not wher
co~modiously to lyue, and in y^ con|trey
which he wolde haue forsaken
for penurie and honger, euen he
nowe is become so ryche, that the
kynge him selfe is glad to come to
hym, and to desire his fauour.


Eus.
O wonderful workes of god.


Chri.
Here finde we that true, whiche is
spoken by the wyseman: Put thy
truste in god, and abide in thine e|state,
for it is an easye thinge in the
syght of god,Eccle. xi. to make a poore man
ryche, yea and that sodenlye. The

blessinge of god hasteth to the re|warde
of the ryghteous, and ma|keth
his frutes sone to florishe and
prosper.


Theo.
This in dede was
proued true in Isahac. phil. Not in
Isahac onlye, but in so many as e|uer
obeyed the voyce of God, and
liued according to their vocacion.
God is the same god to vs all, that
he was to Abraham and Isahac,
if we by stronge faythe hange on
hym and on his fatherlye proui|dence,
as they dyd, if the same inte|gritie
of maners and innocencie of
lyfe apeareth in vs, that shined in
them.


Euse.
This beneficence and
liberalitie of god towarde Isahac
ought to encourage al men to tary
at home in their own contreis and
houses, to be contente wyth theire
estate  callinge, and not to stray a
brode for liuinges, as many idle
braynes do nowe a daies, leauinge
theyr wyues and theire children in

greate care and miserie, and manie
of them neuer returning vnto the~.
Neyther ought men to doubte, but
that god whiche is almyghty, and
able to do what soeuer hys good
pleasure is, wyl as wel prouide for
them at home in their poore cota|ges,
as in the haulles of Princes.
The blessinge of the lorde maketh
men ryche,Proue. x. as for carefull trauaile
it doth nothing therto.


Phil.
When
Isahac sent his so~ne Iacob to Me+sopotamia,Gene. xxviii.
y^ he might take to wife
one of y^ doughters of Laba~, Iacob
as he passed forthe on his iourney,
made a vow,  sayd: If god wyl be
with me,  wil kepe me in this iour+ney
which I go, and wyll geue me
bread to eate  clothes to put on, so
y^ I come againe vnto my fathers
house in safetye, the~ shal y^ lorde be
my god,  this stone which I haue
set vp an ende, shall be gods house,
and of all that thou shalte geue me
wyll I geue the tenthe vnto thee.

Here Iacob desireth gods assiste~ce
in his iourney, that he may go and
come safe. And as touching world|ly
goodes, he desireth no more but
foode and raiment. And so nothing
douting of goddes helpe, he goeth
forward on his iourney according
to the co~maundeme~t of his father.
Nowe behold the louing kyndnes
of god toward Iacob. God which
neuer leaueth them socourles that
calle on hys holye name, appea|reth
vnto Iacob in his slepe, and
promiseth that he wyl geue him 
his seede the lande that he slepeth
vpon, and that his posteritie shall
be great and many, that they shall
be as the dust of the earth, and shal
spread abroude to the weaste, to the
easte, to the north, and to the south,
yea and that in his sede all kinreds
of the earth shall be blessd.


Chri.
Here are mo benefites promised to
Iacob, then he asked.


Phil.
Yea mo

then he durst haue required of god


Euse.
But what of the requestes co~+cerninge
his iourney?


Phil.
Ye shal
heare. Wher as Iacob desired god
to be with him, and to kepe him in
his iourney, god sayd vnto him on
this maner: Behold I am with the
and wyll be thy keper in all places
whither thou goest, and wyl bring
the againe into this lande, neither
wil I leaue the vntil I haue made
good al that I haue promised the.
According to goddes promise Ia|cob
had a prosperous iourney tra|uailynge
into Mesopotamia. Of
whose co~minge, when Laba~ heard,
vnto whom he was sente of his fa|ther,Gene. xxi.
Laban for very ioye ranne to
mete him, enbrased him, and kissed
him, and brought him to his house


Theo.
Thys was good lucke.


Chri.
Good lucke in dede.


Phi.
So
worketh god for hys seruauntes,
which hath all mens hartes in his

hande.


Theo.
But what entertaine+ment
had Iacob afterwarde?


Phil.
Iacob taried wyth Laban twenti
yeres: in the which tyme, God dyd
not only sende him bread  clothes
accordinge to hys requeste, but al|so
such wiues as his harte desired,
wyth manye goodly children. Yea
God so blessed Iacob, that he was
excedinge ryche in gold and siluer,
in maide seruauntes and men ser|uauntes,
in shpe, Camels, Asses,Gene. xxxi.
goates, kyne. c. And afterwarde
God brought him home again in|to
his contreye bothe saffelye and
wealthely. Who will now distrust
the promyse of suche a Lorde, so li|berall,
so bounteous so beneficial?


Euse.
This historie is greatlye co~|fortable
for al godly traualers by
co~treies, hereof may they learne, y^
god wil not forsake the~ nor leue the~
socourles, but se~d the~ al things ne|cessary
in their iourney, defe~d them

frome theire ennemies, and safely
bryng them who~ agayn, if they cal
on his holy name  caste their care
on hym.


Chri.
So sayth the Psal|mographe,Psal. xci.
he shall giue his Aun|gels
charge ouer the, to kepe the in
al thy wayes. They shal beare the
in theire handes, that thou hurte
not thy foote against a stone. God
shall defende the vnder hys wyn|ges,
 thou shalt be safe vnder hys
fethers. His faithfulnes  trueth
shal be thi sheld  buckelar. Thou
shalt not be afraid for ani terrour
by nyght, nor for y^ arrowe y^ flyeth
by y^ day.Psal. cxx. Againe, my helpe cometh
euen from y^ lord which hath made
heaue~  earth. He wil not suffer thi
foote to be moued,  he that kepeth
the, will not sleape. Behold he that
kepeth Israel shal neither slomber
nor sleape. The Lorde hym selfe is
thy keper, the Lorde is thy defence
vpon thy ryghte hande.

So that the sunne shall not burne
the by daye, neither the moone by
nyght. The Lord shal preserue the
from all euyl, yea it is euen he that
shal kepe thy soule. The Lord shal
preserue thy goinge oute and thy
comminge in from thys time forth
for euermore.


Theo.
These be swete
and comfortable scriptures


Phil.
I graunt to the faithefull, whiche
depend altogether on God and on
hys fatherlye prouidence. But the
vnfaithfull, whiche truste on them
selfes, on their owne wysdome, and
pollicy, fele no sauour nor swetnes
in them, as saynt Paule saith: a na+turall
man perceaueth not the thin+ges
that belo~g to the spirit of god
for they are folyshnes vnto hym.
But let vs beholde mo histories,
which shal declare  set forth god|des
hi prouidence  singular libe+ralite
toward his seruauntes, y^ we
mai learne perfectli to ha~ge on the

lorde our god. Ye reade in the first
boke of Moses, that in the time of
Iacob whom we spake of a litle a|fore,Gene. xli.
there was a great dearth in al
contreis, in somuch that in the la~de
of Canaan there was no vitaile to
be gotten for money. Now behold
the prouidence of god. God afore+seyng
this plage of famine, to the
entente that his seruauntes shulde
not peryshe in tyme of honger for
lacke of fode,Gene. xxxvii. wonderfully sent Io+seph
afore into Egipte. And al|though
his brothers solde him in
to a straunge land, by this meanes
sekyng his destruccion, yet god tur+ned
thys his seruitude vnto his ho+nour,
and the euel that they dyd to
theyr brother, vnto their profite,
wealthe,Gene. iiii. and commoditie. For god
exalted Ioseph, and set vp his ho|nour
aboue all the lordes and prin+ces
of Egipte: euen nexte vnto the
Kynge was he in dignitie, in so|much

that he hadde the rule of all
the kynges dominions,  did what
semed him good in his owne eyes,
such fauour founde he in the syght
of the kynge thorow goddes wor|king.
Now when this dearth was
also felte in the lande of Canaan,
and Iacob w^t his familie in great
daunger thereof,ene. xlii. Iacob hearinge
that corne was to be sold in Egipt
(for thorowe Iosephes wisedome
was there corne inoughe layde vp
in the store houses of euerye Citye
in Egipte)ene. xli. sente his sonnes thither
to bye corne for theire money, that
they might liue and nt die. To be
short, seyng the historie is knowen,
when the sonnes of Iacob came thi+ther
for vitaile, there was Ioseph
their brother in hie authoritie, who~
they iudged eyther to be dead, or
elles to liue lyke a bonde slaue and
drudge, not able eyther to do him
selfe good or any other. In fewe,

they had vitailes home with them,
and their money also, with manye
precious gyftes, and at the laste a
co~maundement geuen them y^ they
shuld bringe their father and hysGene. xlii  . xiv.
houshold wyth al that he had, and
prouision shulde be made for them
euen in the best partes of the lande
of Egipte. Yea the kynge him selfe
sente charttes oute of Egypte to
fetche Iacob and all his familie,
and bad them not regarde theire
stuffe, for the good of all the lande
of Egipte is youres, sayth he. Ia|cob
and all his were honorablye
brought thyther, liberally and gen+tly
enterteyned of the kynge,Gene. xv. qui|etely
and wealthelye placed in the
lande of Egypt. And all this came
to passe by the prouidence of God,
whiche afore seynge thynges to
come, worketh wonderfullye for
the sauegarde and healthe of hys
seruauntes.

For the cause that Iacob and hys
chyldren found such fauour in the
syght of kynge Pharao, was not
fortune, nor chaunce, but goddes
prouidence: againe, that Ioseph
was exalted vnto such dignitie, the
cause thereof was not Iosephes
fayr face, nor yet his goodly perso|nage,
but gods good wyll, whiche
gaue him suche wisedome, as none
had the lyke in all Egipte, neither
was there any in al the dominions
of kynge Pharao founde lyke vn|to
Ioseph, whom the kyng might
make gouernour ouer his realme.
And al these thinges wrought god
for the preseruacio~ of his seruaun|tes
as Ioseph himselfe said to his
brethren: xlv. I am Ioseph your bro|ther,
whom you solde in to Egipte.
Nowe therefore be not greued ther+wyth,
neyther let it seme a cruell
thinge in your eyes that ye solde
me hither. For god dyd sende me

before you into Egipte for your
wealth, and to saue your liues. For
this is the second yere of dearth in
the lande, and fyue mo are behind,
in whiche there shall bee neyther
earing nor heruest. Wherfore god
sente me before you to make proui+sion,
that ye myght continue in the
earth, and to saue your lyues by a
greate deliueraunce. So nowe it
was not you that sente me hither
but god, which hath made me a fa|ther
vnto Pharao, and lorde of all
his house, and ruler thorowe oute
all the lande of Egipte. God hym
selfe also spake vnto Iacob in a vi+sion
by nyght, saying: I am god,
the god of thy father, feare not to
go doune into Egipte, for I wyll
there make of the a greate people.
I wyll go doune wyth the into E|gipte,
and I wyll also bringe the a+gayne.


Chri.
O the vnspeakeable
good wyll of god toward all them

that trust in hym. What other na|cion,
saith Moses, is so greate that
goddes come so nye vnto,eut. iiii. as the
lorde our god is nye vnto vs in all
thynges, so ofte as wee call vnto

neyther destroye vs, nor forget the
appointement of our fathers, whi|che

The last
historie which you rehearsed, neigh+bour

Behold mi seruauntes shal drinke,

shall be confounded. Beholde my

quietnesse of hearte, but ye shal cry

Dauid dothe not muche differ

Beholde the eyes of the lorde are

that he maye deliuer their lyues
from death, and noryshe them in
tyme of honger.Proue. x. Salomon also
sayth: the lorde wyl not let the life
of the ryghteous suffer honger.


Phil.
After god had deliuered the
Israelites out of Egipte with an
out stretched arme, and broughte
them into the wyldernes of Sin,
where they sawe neither meate nor
drynke (for god was determined to
proue them whether they wer faith+full
or not) they grudged againste
Moses and Aaron,Exod. xvi. sayinge: wolde

Ye se the vnthanckefulnes of this

God had shewed so greate tokens
of louynge kyndenes, euen as a fa+ther

howe they are altogether swarued
frome God and from his holy pro+uidence,
so that they are worthy no

yea rather eue~ for his promis

Wel yet note:
Notwithstandinge their infideli|tie,
vnthanckefulnes, and disobe|dience
God continued styl iuste in
his promises, faythfull in his wor|des,
 true in his dealynges, for ac|cordinge
to their desire for his pro+myse
sake, he wolde not suffer them
to wante, but gaue them whatsoe|uer
they lusted for. Ther we~t forth
a wynde frome the Lorde, saythe
the scripture,Nume. x. and brought quailes
from the sea and let them fal about
the host, eue~ a daies iournei rou~d a+bout

they dyd flye in the ayer as it were
two cubites hye ouer the earthe.

And the people stode vp,  all that
daye, and all that nyghte, and on
the morow they gathered quayles.
And he that gathered a litle, gathe+red
ten homers full. And they
spred them abrode rounde aboute

hys promyse sake, cheryshed the Is+raelytes
although vnfaythful, vn|thanckefull
and disobedient, euen
as y^e Nurse doth hir sucking babe,
and fedde them by the space of .xl.

Such shal neuer wa~t.
Nowe marcke what followeth. As

god prouided meate for the Israe|lites,
so in lyke manner suffered
he them not to go naked, nor to
peryshe for colde, but all that tyme
of fortye yeres, when they were in
the wyldernesse, he so preserued
their clothes, that they waxed not
olde, and soo saued their shooes
that they were not worne: but both
garmentes and shooes so whole at
the fortie yeres ende, as they were
at their fyrste comminge into wil|dernes.Deu. xxix.
I haue led you forty yeres

Thys man of God lyued in

prouyded for hys seruaunt Elias.
Fyrste when the waters began to

that whe~ other perished for lacke of

as touchyng his meate, behold the
wonderfull power of God, whyche
commaunded the Rauens to fede
him and to bringe him meate. The
Rauens, saith y^ scripture, brought
hym breade and fleshe in the mor|ning,

and likewise bread and fleshe
in the eueninge,  he dronke of the

god prouideth for his seruau~t. He
maketh the foules of the ayer to be
Elias cookes,  to bring him meat,
and god him self is butler  geuith
him drinke at y^e broke Cherith. O
what a god haue the faythful, how
tender  gentle, howe louinge and
kynde is he to al the~ that put their
truste in him? Rather then his ser|uaunt
shulde die for meate, he ma|keth
the foules of the ayer to bring
him thinges necessary for the suste+nau~ce
of his bodie. O behold  di+gently

the brooke was dryed vp because

God, whych neuer leaueth his ser|uauntes

socourles sayd to Elias,
vp and get the to Sarepta, why|che
is in Sidon, and dwel ther, be|holde
I haue commaunded a wi|dowe
there to sustayne the. So he
arose, and went to Sarepta. And
when he came to the gate of the ci|tye,
the wydowe was there gathe|ryng
styckes. And he called to hir
and sayd: fet me I praye the a lytle
water in a vessel, y^t I may drincke.
And as she was goyng to fet it, he
cryed after hir, and sayd: Brynge
me I praye the a morsell of breade
also in thyne hande. She sayd: As
trulie as the Lord thy God lyueth
I haue no breade redye, but euen
an handefull of meale in a barrell
and a lytle oyle in a cruse. And be|holde
I am gatherynge two styc|kes
for to go in,  dresse it for me 
my sonne, that we may eate  dye.
And Elias sayde vnto hir: feare
not, come and do as thou hast said,

but make me thereof a lytle cake
fyrste of al, and bringe it vnto me,
and afterwarde make for the  thy
sonne. For thus sayeth the Lorde
God of Israel: the meale in the ba+rel
shal not be waked, neyther shal
the oyle in the cruse be diminished,
vntyl the Lord haue sent raine vp+on
the earth. And she dyd as Ely|as
sayd. And she and hyr house did
eate a good space, and the meale
wasted not out of y^ barrel, neyther
was the oyle spent out of the cruse
accordyng to the word of the lord,
whych he spake by the hand of E|lyas.
Here agayne ye se what pro|uysyon
God made for Elyas, and
howe benefycyall he also was to
Elyas hostesse, and to her house|holde,

We reade al+so
that a certeine woma~ of y^ wiues
of the Prophetes came vnto Heli+seus
the Prophet,iiii. Reg. iiii. declaringe vnto
him, that her husband was dead, 
that for dette which she ought and
was not able to paye, the creditour
was come to fet her .ii. sonnes to be
his bond men. This woman was
a Prophetes wyfe. Her husband is
dead, which lefte her both pore and
in dette. Comforte hathe she none,
but only the co~pany of her .ii. so~nes
which also the creditour wold take
awaye and make his bonde men,
because she is not able to discharge
the dette. O in what miserye is
this carefull woman? She hathe

nothing at al in her house, but a pit+cher
of oyle. But what is that to
the dispatche of the dette. And if
that be gone, there remaineth no|thing
wherof she  her sonnes may
lyue. What is then to be done?
Det must be payed. Her substau~ce
wyl not reache so far. To make her
childre~ bond slaues, shuld be to her
present death. This therfore remai+neth.
The sorowfull widowe lame~+teth
fyrst of all her cause secretly in
her hert vnto god, which is the hel+per
and patrone of all true wyd+dowes
and fatherlesse children, and
afterwarde vttereth the same to E+lizeus
the Prophet of god, whiche
thorow gods blessinge of one pyt+cher
of oyle, filleth so many emptie
vessels ful of oyle, that she sellinge
part of the same, was not only able
to paie her dettes at the vttermost,
but also had inough of the reste to
fynde her and her children.

feared the lorde, therfore could not
she and her children remaine longe

children.Psal. xxxvii. I haue not sene the rygh|teous

At a nother
tyme also we reade, y^t thaforesayd
Prophet in the tyme of dearth fed
the Prophets childre~,iii. Reg. iii.  with a few
loaues norished a great number of
men, in somuche that they dyd not
only eat inough, but also left much
of y^e bread, so greatly was it multi+plied
thorow y^e blessing of god, whi+ch
is able of a lytle to make much,
seyng of nothing he made al. Geue
vnto the people, y^t they may eat, say+eth
y^e Prophet. The minister answe+red:
What, shulde I set this before
an hundred men? Set it before the
people, sayth he, and let them eate,

For thus sayth the lord: They shal
eate and leaue. And he dyd set it be+fore
them, and they dyd eate and
leaue accordyng to the word of the
lorde. Se ye not here, what the bles+syng
of the lord is, and how al thin+ges
increase and abound,Psal. cxlv. when the
lord openeth his hande? If we de+pend
on goddes goodnes, he wyll
surely increase our vitayle in our
store houses, vpon our table, yea
in our mouthes and bellies.
The Prophets seruaunt though
it not possible, that so great a num+ber
of menne coulde be sustayned
wyth so fewe loaues.Math. xix. But that
whiche is impossible with menne,Marke. x.
is possible with god.Luke. xviii.
Who therefore wyll doubte anye
more of goddes liberalitie, haue
he muche, or haue he litle? It is
all one before God to feede wyth
muche, or to feede wyth lytle.

If god blesse vs, we can not want,
but if Gods blessinge be taken fro~
vs, we muste nedes peryshe.

muche of the fragmentes that be
lefte,Iohn. vi. as filled twelue baskets full.
At a nother tyme, when the people
hadde bene with Christ thre daies,
and were readye to departe, ha|uynge
nothynge to eate, and some
of them hadde farre to go, so that
if they had gone awaye wythoute
meate, they shulde haue faynted by

they haue continued with me
three dayes,Math. xv. and haue nothynge

departe fastyng, leste they peryshe
by the waye.

And whe~ his disciples sayd: whe~ce
shuld we get so muche bread in the
wiloernes, as shuld suffice so great
a multitude,  tolde him that they
had but seuen loaues, and a fewe
lytle fyshes, he co~maunded the peo+ple
to sit doune on the ground, and
toke the seue~loaues and the fishes,
and geuyng thankes, brake them,
and deliuered them to his disciples,
and the disciples to the people, and
they all dyd eate and were fylled.
And they toke vp of y^e broke~ meate
that was lefte, seuen baskets full.
And yet they that did eate wer .iiii.
thousand men besides women and
chyldren. Here se ye, that the loaues
and fyshes were multiplyed in the
handes of the disciples, and in the
mouthes and bellies of them that

so myghty is he to preserue the li|ues

Al such that so mary,  continue in
the feare of god, may be sure, that
the water in their welles shal soner
be turned into wine,  the stones of
their walles in to bread,  the claye
of their flores into meat,  y^e thatch
of their houses in to cloth, then thei
shal extremely want necessary thin|ges,
eyther for them selues or for
their family.


Chri.
Wold god al me~
beleued thys. Then shulde they
haue merrye and quiete myndes,
where now thorow infidelitie they
be miserablye disquieted wyth the
care of worldly thynges.


Theo.
Laye thy care on the lorde,
sayth Dauid,sal. lv. and he shal noryshe

care on god, for he careth for you.


Phil.
Agayne,Math. x. how dyd our sauiour
Chryste prouide for hys disciples,
when he sent them forth to preach,
without money or meat? as he him
selfe sayeth in the gospell of Luke.Luke. xxii.
When I sent you without wallet,
and scryp and shoes, lacked ye any
thynge? And they sayde: No. The
disciples accordinge to their voca|cion,
wente forth and preached the
gospell, nothynge doutyng but he
that sente them, wolde prouide for
them. For what maister can fynde
in his hert to se his serua~tes lacke?


Chri.
Thys is verye confortable
for the true Preachers of goddes
word. Herof maye they wel be asser+teined,
that if they do their masters
message faythfullye, they shall not
wante, though the wycked worlde
be neuer so vnthankeful and nyg|gardely
vnto them.



Phil.
O how confortable are these
wordes of our sauioure Christe to
a faythfull christen man:Math. vi. I say vn|to
you, be not carefull for the lyfe,
what ye shall eate, or what ye shall
drinke, nor yet for your body, what
ye shal put on. Is not the life more
worthe then meate, and the bodye
more of value then raymente? Be|hold
the foules of the ayre, for they
sowe not, neither reape, nor yet ca|rye
into the barnes, and yet your
heauenly father feedeth them. Are
ye not muche better then they?
Whych of you (thoughe he tooke
thought therfore) could put one cu+bite
vnto his stature? And whye
care ye then for rayment? Consider
the lylies of the fyelde, howe they
growe. They labour not, neyther
spyn. And yet for all that I say vn+to
you, that euen Salomon in all
his royaltie was not arayed lyke
vnto one of these. Wherfore if god

so cloth the grasse, whych is to day
in the field,  to morow shal be cast
into y^e furnace, shall he not muche
more do y^e same vnto you, o ye of ly+tle
faith? Therfore take no thought
saying: what shal we eate, or what
shall we drinke, or wher w^t shal we
be clothed? After all these thinges
seke y^e ge~tiles. For your heaue~ly fa+ther
knoweth that ye haue nede of
all these thynges. But rather seke
ye fyrst the kyngdome of god, and
the ryghteousenes thereof, and all
these thynges shall be caste vnto
you. Behold what goodly and na|tural
examples our sauiour christ
bringeth forth here, that he may al+lure
vs to truste only on gods pro|uidence,
 not to be carefull for the
necessaries of this lyfe, whych are
not gotten by painful trauaile, but
receyued of gods mere liberalitie.
And because we shuld not be care|ful
for meate, he first setteth before

our eies the foules of y^e ayer for an
example, who~ seing god the father
feedeth so plenteouslie y^t they want
nothyng, when they neyther sowe
nor reape, nor cari in to the barnes,
muche more wyll he feede vs, and
sende vs what soeuer is necessarie
for the preseruacion of thys our na+turall
lyfe, if we call on hys holye
name, and lyue accordynge to our
vocacion. If he fedeth the byrdes
because they be hys creatures, whi|che
notwythstandyng so once dye,
that they neuer lyue after, muche
more wyl he prouide for vs, which
are not only hys creatures, but al|so
created after his owne Image,
endued wyth an immortall soule,
and made vnto this ende, that we
shulde set forth his glorye, prayse
hys blessed name: and after the ge|nerall
resurreccion, our bodies and
soules beyng knytte together, liue
wyth hym in glorye worldes wyth+oute

ende, as hys lawefull heyres,
thorow Iesus Chryste our Lorde.
And as touchynge oure apparell,
to disswade vs from thoughte ta|kynge
for that, he byddeth vs con|sider
and diligentlye marke the ly|lyes
and floures of the field, which
although they neyther labour nor
spynne, are so clothed wyth fyne
and pleasaunte coloures, that not
Kynge Salomon in all hys royal+tie
and glorie was apparelled lyke
vnto one of them. If God so dec|keth
the transitorie flower, whyche
thys daye is in the fielde pleasaunt+ly
growynge, and to morowe shall
be cut downe and caste into the fur+nace,
howe muche more wyll he
sende vs conueniente apparell for
oure bodies, whyche thoughe they
once dye, yet shal they ryse againe,
and for euer lyue wyth God in e|ternall
glorye?

Christ therfore concludeth, that all
these thynges shal be cast vnto vs,
if we seke the kyngdom of god and
the ryghteousnes therof. Lette vs
seke heaue~ly thinges, and thynges
worldly shall abunde vnto vs. Let
vs labour to garnishe our mindes
wyth vertues, and god wyl not suf+fer
our bodies to peryshe for lacke
of transitory thynges.Psal. cxxxvi. For god is
the lorde which geueth meate to al
fleshe.Psal. cxlvii. He geueth, as the Psalmo|graphe
saith, fode to the cattel, and
fedeth the yonge rauens that call
vpon hym. He fedeth y^e Turke, the
Saracen, the Iewe, and all the ra|ble
of Infidelles for their creacion
sake, and for his mercies sake. He
therfore wil not leaue them that be
hys faythfull people vnprouided,
socourles and destitute of help. He
geueth the vyle wormes of y^e earth
not only theyr beyng, but also wher
of to lyue: he therfore wil not se the

faythful man lacke, which is made
lyke vnto hys owne similitude and
image. Let vs therfore neuer des|payre
eyther of fode, or of apparel.
God gaue vs the lyfe, god wyl pre+serue
the lyfe. God gaue vs the bo+die,
god wyl clothe the body. Away
therfore wyth carefull pensiuenes,
and pensyue care. Let vs cast oure
eyes on gods most holy and infal|lible
prouidence, which is certeine
and neuer fayleth.Luke. xii. Take hede and
beware of couetousnes, sayth oure
sauiour christ, for no mans lyfe sta~+deth
in thabundaunce of the thin|ges,
whych he possesseth.

A man is borne to labour, eue~

thou returne vnto the earthe,
whence thou wast taken: For earth
thou art and vnto earth shalt thou
returne.sal. cxxviii. Dauid also sayeth: Thou
shalt eate the labours of thine own

Paul geueth a co~mau~dement, that

if ani man wil not labour, the same
shuld not eate, and geueth a charge
that all men worke wyth quietnes,
and eate their owne bread. We be|seche

The Magistrate is called of god
to rule wyth the temporall swerde,
to be gouernoure of the people, to
promote goddes worde, to noryshe
the preachers of the same, to exer|cyse
iustice, to defende the wydowe
and fatherles, to conserue the com|mon
weale, to banyshe all false reli+gion
out of his realme, and to seke
the quietenes and co~moditie of his
subiectes, euen as a father seketh
the health and profite of hys natu+rall
sonne. The spirituall minister
is appoynted of God to rule wyth
the swerde of the spirite, whych is
the word of god, to rebuke sinners
wyth the lawe, yea and to excomu|nicate
them, if thei be obstinat and
wyll not repent, to conforte and che+ryshe
the weake with the swete pro+mises

of the holy scripture, to enco+rage
the stronge,  to exhorte them
to go forward vntyl they waxe an+cient,
and be perfect in Christes re+ligion,
to minister the sacramentes,
to make colleccions for the pore, to
mayntein hospitalitie, for the relief
of the nedie. The subiecte is called
of god to obey, and to be in subiec|cion
vnto his superiours, and eue|rye
one of them is bound by the co~+maundeme~t
of god, to lyue in their
vocacio~. The Lawer, in pleadyng
and defending poore mens causes:
The Shomaker, in making shoes,
the Tailour, in making garme~tes,
the Merchaunt, in occupyinge mer+chandise
faythfullye and trulie, the
Scholemaster, in bringing vp his
scholers godly and vertuously, the
Father of the houshold, to prouide
for his familie, the Mother of the
housholde, to looke vpon thynges
perteyning to the house, and to see

her familie well gouerned, and so
forth in al other personnes, in what
soeuer state God hath called them.
Euerie man in his vocacion ought
to laboure, and by no meanes to be
idle. And who so dothe, God wyll
blesse his laboures, and sende hym
wherewyth abundauntlie to lyue.

Philemon.
God in deede
hathe promised to fede vs, but yet
so, that we oure selues laboure for
oure liuinge. God hath promised
vs saluacion in Chryste Iesu,
yet so, that wee beleue hys pro|mise,

and laboure to the vttermost
of our power, to frame oure lyues
accordynge to hys blessed wyll.
Dauid saythe not onlye,Psal. xxxvii. Spera in
domino, truste in the Lorde, but he
addeth vnto it, et fac bonitatem,
and do good. All oure affiaunce
and truste, must be reposed in God,
and all good thynges muste be lo|ked
for at his hand, yet must we do
that lyeth in oure power concer|nynge
all those thynges that wee
desyre to obtayne of God.
Therefore Chryste saythe:Math. vi. Take
no thought. He sayth not, laboure
not. The pensiue care and thought
takyng for our liuyng, wherwyth
the Heathen be so greatly disquie|ted,
we must caste away from vs,
and laie it vpon God, which careth
for vs: but as for labour, whych is
layed vpon vs of God as a Crosse
for oure synne, and disobeience in

Adam, we may not refuse, euery ma~
in his vocacion, but ioyfullye take
it vpon vs, and geue god thankes,
that by suche meanes without our
care and thought takyng, he wyll
fede vs accordynge to his worde.
For what are all oure paynes, la|bours,
and trauailes, if god blesse
them not?sal. cxxvii. as the Psalmograph say+eth:
Except the lord build the house
their labour is but lost that builde
it. Except the lord kepe the citie, he
watcheth but in vaine that kepeth

Chri.
Me thinke the occasion of
thys dearth, wherwyth we are now
oppressed, is not so greatly to be as+cribed
vnto the couetousnes of cer+teine
gredye gripes, as vnto oure
owne selues, vnto our vngodlines
and dissolucion of lyfe, whiche so
lyue, as though there were no God
at all, so behaue oure selues, as
thoughe there were neither heauen
nor hell. They whych haue the gos+pell

swymminge in their lyppes, so
liue cleane contrary to the doctrine
of the gospell, as though ther were
no gospell at all. In ambicion, in
pride, in couetousnes, in enuye, in
malice, in wa~tonnes of lyfe. c. thei
geue place to none. Another sorte
are so drowned in papistry, in super+sticion,
in hipocrisie. c. and burne
wyth suche an immortall hatred a|gainste
gods worde, that they can
neyther abyde that (otherwyse then
it shall serue their phansie) nor the
preachers of it, nor yet suche as a
uaunce it. Can God do any other+wyse
then sende his plages, where
such impiety  vngodlines reigne?
It commeth from gods great mer|cies,
that we be not consumed, and
handled as Sodome  Gomorre.
But our owne damnacion slepeth
not, if we do not bothe shortly and
earnestly repente and amende.


Phil.
Trueth it is in dede, that god

many times sendeth the plage of fa+myne
into the worlde for sinne,
as it came to passe in the tyme of
that moste wycked an idolatrous
kynge Achab, and at diuerse other
tymes.ute. xxviii. And Moses that most excel+lente
Prophet of God, sayth: If
thou wylte herken diligently vnto
the voice of the lorde thy god, to ob+serue
 do al his co~maundeme~tes,
whych I co~maunde the thys daye,
the lord wil set the vp on hie aboue
all nacions of the earthe. And all
these blessinges shall come on the,
and ouertake the, if thou wylt her|ken
vnto the voice of the Lord thy
god. Blessed shalte thou bee in the
towne, and blessed in the fieldes.
Blessed shall be the frute of thy bo+die,
the fruite of thy grounde, and
the fruite of thy cattell, the frute of
thy oxen, and thy flockes of shepe.
Blessed shall thy almerye bee and
thy store. Blessed shalte thou bee

both when thou goest out, and bles+sed
when thou comest in. c. The
Lord shal commaund the blessinge
to be with the in thy store houses,
and in all that thou setteste thyne
hande to. c. The Lorde shal make
thee plenteouse in goodes, in the
frute of thy bodye, in the frute of
thy cattell, and in the frute of thy
grounde. c. The Lorde shall o|pen
vnto thee hys good treasure, e|uen
the heauen, to geue rayne vn+to
thy lande in due ceason, and to
blesse all the laboures of thyne
hande. c. But and if thou wylte
not herken vnto the voyce of the
Lorde thy god, to kepe and do all
his co~maundementes and ordinau~+ces,
which I co~maunde thee thys
daie, then all these curses shal come
vpon the, and ouertake the. Cursed
shalte thou bee in the towne, and
cursed in the fielde. Cursed shall
thine almery be, and thy store.

Cursed shall the frute of thy bodye
and the fruite of thy lande be, and
the fruite of thy oxen,  the flockes
of thy hepe. And cursed shalt thou
be when thou goeste in, and when
thou goest out. And the lorde shall
send vpon the famine, honger and
goynge to naught in all thynges
that thou settest thine hand to, vn|tyll
thou be destroyed and brought
to naught quyckely, because of the
wyckednes of thyne inuencions, in
that thou haste forsaken the lorde.
And the heauen that is ouer thy
heade shall be brasse, and the earthe
that is vnder thee, Iron. And the
Lorde shall turne the rayne of thy
lande vnto pouder and duste, euen
from heauen shal they come oune
vpon thee, vntyl thou be broughte
to naught. c. Thou shalte carrye
muche sede out in to the fielde, and
shalte gather but lytle in: For the
vermine shall destroy it. The Pro|phet

Esai also saythe:Esai. i. If ye be lo|uynge
and obediente, ye shall eate
the good thinges of the earth. But
if ye bee obstinate and rebellious,
ye shal be deuoured with the swerd.
For thus the lorde hath promised
wyth his owne mouthe. These sen|tences,
with many other in the holy
scripture d euidentlye shewe, that
the plage of famine and honger is
sent vnto vs of god for our sinnes.


Euse.
It is conuenient therefore,
that we all harken to the admoni|cion
of God geuen by the Psalmo|graphe,Psal. lxxxi.
whyche is, that there be no
straunge God amonge vs, nor that
we worshyppe any other God, but
hym alone, whych only is the lorde
our god that deliuered vs oute of
the spirituall Egipte, that is, from
the seruitude and tirannye of Sa|tan.
If we so do, God promiseth
that he wyll geue vs what soeuer
we aske of hym. He wyll feede vs

wyth the finest wheat floure, yea 
satisfie vs wyth hony out of the sto+nie
rocke. But to obteine of God
this abundaunce  wealth, we may
worship, and haue no straunge god+des.
These straunge  new founde
gods, are not only idolles and mau+mettes
made of wood or stone, whi|che
in tymes past the simple and fo+lyshe
ignorant people worshipped
as gods, but the abhominable vi|ces,
whych reigne so comonly nowe
amonge vs, I meane couetousnes,
pryde, ambicion, glotonie, lecherie,
malyce. c. These are straunge
goddes. These muste we put oute
of our breastes, if we wyl haue god
mercyfull and liberall vnto vs.
For is thys reasonable for vs to
serue straunge goddes, and to geue
ouer oure selues as bonde slaues
to them, and yet to requyre our wa|ges
and rewarde of the true and on+lye
liuynge God? What felowship

hath righteousnes wyth vnrighte|ousnes?ii. Cor. vi.
What company hath light
with darkenes? What co~cord hath
Christ w^t Belial? Either what part
hath he y^t beleueth with an infidel?
How agreeth the te~ple of god with
idolles?Roma. vi. Know ye not saith .s. Paul
how that to whom soeuer ye co~mit
your selues as seruau~tes to obey,
his seruantes ye are to who~ ye obei,
whether it be of sinne vnto deathe,
or of obedie~ce vnto ryghteousnes?
Euery one y^t doth sinne, is the ser|ua~t
of sinne,Iohn. vii saith Christ. We must
first of al be gods seruantes, before
we flatter our selues w^t the obtey|ning
of the good thinges promised
by god, or elles we deceiue our sel|ues.
If we be once the seruantes of
god, and faithfully continue in his
seruice, then maye we be bolde to
axe of hym oure wages, and to per|swade
oure selues, that all the con|fortable
Histories and sentences,

whych we reade in the holye scrip|tures,
perteine vnto vs, otherwyse
we haue no more to do wyth them,
then the Turcke or the Iewe. And
if we receiue anye good thynge at
the hande of god beyng not his ser+uauntes,
we receiue it as all other
Infidelles do, vnto our damnacio~.


phil.
I confesse neyghbour Eusebi+us
all this to be true, whyche you
haue now spoken. Neyther meante
I by talking so much of gods gen+tlenes
and liberalitie,  by alledge|ynge
all these confortable histories
and sentences, to stablyshe the Ido+laters
in their Idolatrie, the wyc|ked
in their wyckednes, the coue|tous
worldlynges in their coue|tousenes,
the proude in their pride,
the lecherous in their lecherie, the
idle bellies in their idlenes. c. and
yet notwythstanding to loke for
al those good thynges at the hand of
god, whych belonge vnto his ser|nauntes,

as he wytnesseth by the
Prophete,Esai. lxv. but to declare for your
conforte and myne, that so manye
as geue them selues ouer to God,
beleue in him, feare him, serue him,
and lyue accordynge to their voca|cion,
shall neuer peryshe for hon|ger,
but at all tymes haue what so|euer
is necessarye for them. And if
any shuld chaunce to famishe (whi|che
seldome or neuer happeneth)
God suffereth them so to do, partly
that he may the soner call them vn|to
hys glorie, partelye, that their
death maye turne vnto the greater
dampnacion of suche vnmercifull
monstures, as suffered the seruaun+tes
of god to peryshe for honger.

take the matter. And I
for my parte thanke you ryght her
tely for your godlye admonicions,

frely confessinge that I am muche
edified by your talke, and strongly
enarmed agaynst the dartes of po|uertie
and honger, when soeuer thei
shall go aboute to oppresse me.


Christo.
We all confesse no lesse.


Euse.
I spake that I spake, to this
ende, that men shulde not flatter
them selues w^t the swete  conforta+ble
promises of god, when they lyue
in all wyckednes, and abhominaci|on,
whych promises perteyne not
vnto them, but vnto the faythefull
seruauntes of god, whych shall en|ioye
no lesse at the hande of god,
then he hath promised. If they wyl
enioye the lyke commoditie, they
must do the like seruise. Thei must
away with their straunge and new
founde goddes, I meane, pryde, co+uetousenes,
gluttonie, whoredome,
malice. c. and serue the onlye true,
and liuynge God.


Philemon.
Well
neyghboures, to knyt vp our talke

wyth fewe wordes, ye haue hearde
howe beneficiall God is to them
that put theyre truste iu hym, and
lyue accordyng to theire vocacion:
so that those that be faytheful nede
not to despayre of comfort, seme the
scarsenes of thynges so greate, that
it bryngeth presente deathe almoste
wyth it. For in that dearthe and
penurye, the faytheful man that ca+steth
hys care on God, and han|geth
wholly on hys fatherlye pro|uidence,Psal. xxii.
maye well saye wyth the
Psalmograph. If I walcke in the
myddes of the shadowe of deathe,
I will not be afrayde of any euell,
for thou arte wyth me. God is euer
present wyth hys people in al their
tribulacion,Psal. xci.  he wyl vndoubtedlie
delyuer them,  saue them harmles.
Thys nowe remayneth, that when
ye come amonge the poore neadye
Christians, ye conforte them wyth
these swete scriptures that ye haue

hearde, which wythout all doubte
shal greatly stirre and quiete their
myndes, and refrayne them frome
attemptyng any vnlawful redresse
of thynges after this. Agayne, ac|cordinge
to your habilitie, releue
their pouertie wyth your ryches.
Exhorte your ryche neyghboures
lykewyse to be beneficiall to the
poore, as the faythful stewardes of
God, remembrynge that vnto that
ende god hath endued them wyth
theyr possessions. Praye vnto god
that he maye geue vnto the coue|touse
worldlynges, a merciful and
liberall herte, that after thys they
maye no lesse wyllynglye seeke the
profite of their neyghboures, then
hytherto they haue soughte theyr
owne priuate lucre, and singulare
commoditie. To conclude, pray vn+to
god, that euerie one of vs maye
so lyue, and so frame our lyfe accor+ding
to his wyl, that he may vouch+safe

to blesse vs, and send vs neces|saryes
for our liuyng, that we may
the more frelye, and wyth the more
quiete mindes, serue him in holines
and ryghteousnes all the dayes of
oure lyfe.Luke. i. Well neyghboures, I
praye you take the paynes to come
into the parlour wyth me. Ye shall
take your parte of suche homelye
fare as I haue. And I praye yon
be no strau~gers: The ofter ye come
the more welcome shall you be.


Euse.
We thanke you moste gentle
neyghboure Philemon, and
praised be the lord for your
godlye and confortable
exhortacions. Chri.

AMEN.
Geue the glorie to god
alone.
