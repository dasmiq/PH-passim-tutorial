 A plaine subuersyon or tur|nyng vp syde down of all the argu+mentes, that the Popecatholykes can make for the maintenaunce of auricular confession, with a moste wholsome doctryne touchyng the due obedience, that we owe vn|to ciuill magistrates, made dialogue wyse betwene the Prentyse and the Priest by Gracyous Menewe.
Psalme. 31.
I sayd, I will confesse my sines vnto the Lorde: and so thou for|gaueste the wickednesse of my people.




To all faythfull brethren / that loue Iesu Chryste sincerelye, Gracious Menewe wysheth grace and peace of consci|ence, and Godly strength from God the father throughe oure Lord Iesu Chryst.
MAny in these moste pery|lous tymes, whych haue deseruingly chaunced vn+to vs for our synnes, are in such perplexite and tro+ble of conscience, that they can not tel, which waye to turne the~selfes, whom to helpe and succoure, accor+dyng to the lyttell talent that God

hath lent me, I haue thought to be my bounden duty. And truelye I would haue long agone discharged my conscience in thys parte, If I myght by any meanes haue conue|niently published and sette forth abroade those thynges, that I had prepared for the purpose. But that could not bee, whyche thynge was to me no lesse gryeuous, than if I my selfe had felte the same burde~ and payne, that I sawe my poore brethren to fele: howbeit sith, accor+dyng to the commen prouerbe, it is better late then neuer: I haue now at thys present penned or written out a litle treatyse, wherin I show briefly out of Gods boke and such auncyent wryters, as ground their sayinges vpon the same, how farre forth we oughte to bee obedyente vnto ciuill magistrates.What is co~+tayned in thys boke. And thys I dyd because many are of this o|pinion, that they are bounde to do

whatsoeuer the higher powers co~+maunde them, though their lawes were directlye agaynste God and his word,What mo|ued me to wryte here of the obe|die~ce due to magi|strates. in so much that they per|suade them selues that they shalbe excused by them in the dreadful dai of iudgemente, when we shall ap|peare all before god, if at anye tyme they commit manifest Idola+trye and playne vngodlynesse throughe theyr commaundement. Whom I desyer in the bowels of our sauiour Iesu Christ, who hath shedde his blood indifferently for all them, that heare his worde o|bedyently, and wythout any feare what man can doe vnto them, stike and cleaue stedfastly vnto it: that they wyll dyligently and wythout affectyon, puttyng asyde all vayne loue of their selues, looke vpon the places and examples of the holye scripture, and vpon the autorites of the olde auncyente fathers, that

I haue here alleaged in thys my small boke, truly aunswerynge all maner of obiectyons that ar made to the contrary, then I truste, they wil be better aduised, and ceasse to please themselues in that which is euil, or to iustifie their manifest disobedyence towardes God and hys woorde, vnder the pretence and colour of the obedyence that we owe vnto hys magistrates and rulers of the earth: whom in the scriptures we are streightlye com|maunded to obeye,Roma. 13. 1. Peter. 2. yea vpo~ paine of damnacyon. But in the meane season, we muste alwayes haue before our eyen the golden se~tence of our sauiour Chryste, where he sayeth: pay that vnto Ceasar, that is due vnto Ceasar,Math. 22. and paye that vnto God, that is due vnto God. If Ceasar, that is to say, the ciuill magistrates commaunde the no|thyng

that God hath forbydde~, or forbydde thee nothynge that God hath commaunded, if thou doeste not then obeye, yea thoghe it were to the ieopardye of losinge both lyfe and goodes, thou mayst be sure that the vengeaunce of god and euerlastynge damnacyon of hell hangeth ouer thy head but if the magistrates forgettyng theyr duetye towardes GOD, from whom they haue receaued all auto+ryte and power, dooe take vpon them, to commaund thee ani thing that GOD hath forbydden, or to forbydde thee any thynge, that the hygheste Monarche of all hath commaunded: thou oughtest in no wyse to obeye, not that thou shouldeste make any resystaunce, whyche thynge GODDES worde teacheth thee not, but that thou shouldest rather w^t Sidrach,

Misach and Abednago and wyth the holy prophete Daniel offer thy selfe to dye a most shamefull and cruel death,Dani. 3.6. than in any wyse to be obedyent to theyr vngodly lawes,  wycked constitutio~s or statutes. This thou mayest learne, with dili+gent and affectuouslesse readynge in this boke, wherin also thou shalt haue a moste necessary doctryne of confession, teachyng thee how au|ricular confession,Auriculare confessyon hath no grou~de nor foundacio~ in goddes worde. whiche nowe a dayes to the great hynderaunce of Goddes trueth, and defacynge of hys glory, is set vp agayne, hath no grounde at al nor foundacyon in Goddes woorde, but is a mere tradition of that Antichryste of Rome, beeyng now, besydes al o|ther enormites, that bee conteined in it, made a snare to snarle  catche men wyth all.
Here are all the argumentes, y^t the Popecatholykes can make for

the maintenaunce of thys Anti|christian tradycyon, cleane subuer+ted and turned vpside down, with the mightye thunder boltes of Goddes word, and with y^e strong batteryng peces of the holye fa|thers of the true catholike church, and spouse of oure sauyoure Iesu Christ.
And then, immediatlye after, it is declared, what maner of con|fessyon God doeth requyre of vs in his most sacred worde and holy scripture.
Thys small laboure of myne, I desyre all true faythfull Chry|styans, to take in good worth, and to praye wyth me instaunt|lye, that God of hys infinite good+nesse and mercye vouchesafe to strengthen them, that doe stande, and to coumforte and helpe the weake hearted, to rayse them vp that fal, and finally to beate down

Sathan vnder oure fete. Whiche thing, doubtelesse, he wyll doe for hys sonne Iesu Chrystes sake, to whom wyth the father, and the holy goste, bee al praise, glorye and honoure, for euer and euer. So be it.

I am glad that I haue met you nowe in so good a tyme, yonge man: for I haue some what to saye to you.


Prentyse.
What haue ye to saye to me master perso~? here I am ready to heare whatsoeuer ye

wyl say.


Priest,
How chaunce that ye are so disobedient at thys time, to y^e Quenes proceadynges? Dooe ye not knowe, that the scripture bid+deth vs to obey y^e higher powers? And hath not the Quenes maie|stye,Of the obe+dyence due to the ciuill magi+strates. wyth her moste honorable counsayl, sent a commission and a most streight iniunction, that al ge+nerally, that are in the yeares of dis+cretion, shoulde come to shrifte or auricular confession? Howe doeth it chaunce then, that ye are so vn|wyllyng to come and to fulfyl her graces commaundment?


Prentise.
I knowe right wel master person, that we are bidden in the scripturs and worde of God to be obedyent to the magistrates and hygher po|wers.
Rom. 13.For S. Paull sayeth: let euery soule submitte her selfe to the au|torite of the higher powers. And in an other place,Titus. 3. warne the~, saieth

he, that they submitte the~selues to rule and power, to obei y^e officers.


Priest.
The better yt knowe youre duty towardes the hygher powers and magistrates, the greater muste be your condemnacyon because ye doe it not.
For the seruaunt, that knoweth hys masters wyl,Luke. 12. and doeth it not, shalbe beaten with many strypes. Here ye thys yonge man? Doe ye not also reade in the place, that ye haue alleaged,Roma. 13. that thei that resist the magistrates, whych are the or|deynaunce of God, shall receaue to themselues damnation?


Pren|tyse.
All that ye haue sayd is true. But what doth it make for our pur+pose? For where the scryptures  worde of God doeth bydde vs to obeye the hygher powers and ma|gistrates, it is not to be vndersta~|ded of those thynges, that pertein to the conscience of manne, whych

ought onli and soleli to be builded vpon the infallyble worde of god,How farre furth we ought to be obedient to ciuil magi|strates. in matters belongyng to saluacy|on, but of ciuill co~stitutio~s, lawes and ordeynaunces, that temporall rulers, gouernours,  magistrates make for the preseruacyon of the commen weale, wherevnto doubt+lesse we ought to be obedyente, as long as they commaunde nothyng that is vngodlye, or forbydde no|thyng, that God hath co~maunded vs to doe.


Priest.
Why doth not S. Peter saye: submitte youre selues to all maner ordeynaunce of man, for the Lordes sake?Peter. 2. Here the blessed A+postel S. Peter doeth bydde vs to be obedyente to all maner of ordei+naunce of man, wythoute any ex|ception.
Whatsoeuer than they co~maunde and ordayne, we are bounde to o|beye

it, layinge asyde all curiouse questioning. For it is neither mete nor conueniente, that subiectes shoulde busye themselues aboute Princes matters, asking, why haue they ordayned thys? Or why haue they ordayned that?
We oughte, wythoute any such busye askynge or questionynge, to be obedyente, whatsoeuer thei co~|maunde vs.
If their lawes and statutes be vngodly, they theyr selues shal ans+were for it, and not we. Our blood shall be required at their handes, if they sette forth any thynge con|trary to Gods worde.
In the meane ceason we, that be subiectes, are bounde to obeye the~.


Prentyse.
As touchynge the text, that ye haue alleaged oute of the fyrste Epystell of Saint Peter,

it oughte otherwyse to bee vnder|standed, than ye doe expounde it. Els had the blessed Apostel him|selfe done contrarye to hys owne saying: for when the rulers and el|ders of Hierusalem,Actes. 4. wyth Annas the chiefe Priest, had commaunded him and Iohn, that in no wise thei should speake or teache in the name of Iesu, they would in no wise o|beye, but rather aunswered them stoutelye, sayinge: whether it bee ryght in the sight of God, to obey you more than God, iudge ye. And in an other place, he wyth the o|ther Apostles sayth plainly thus: better it is to obeye God than ma~.Actes. 5. Wherfore master person, we must necessarely note here, that there be .2. kynds of ordeinaunces of man. The one aperteining to relygyon:Two ki~des of ordey|naunces of man. and those, wythout goddes holye worde, ar altogether vngodly, and in no wyse to be folowed. For thei

bidde vs to worshype God, after mans fancyes and wycked inue~cy|ons of worldly wysdome, and not as he himselfe wylbe worshypped and serued. Therfore they, that fo|lowe them, shall iustlye heare thys sharpe rebuke of the heauenly wis+dome of god: this people draweth nye vnto me wyth theyr mouthes,Math. 15. and honoreth me wyth their lips. Howe beit their hartes are farre from me,Esaie. 29. teachyng doctrynes, that are but mens preceptes. Yea the lord threatneth his people, because they feared hym throughe mens lawes and doctrynes, that he wold destroie the wisdom of their wise, and that the vnderstandynge of theyr learned men should perishe. And not wythoute a good cause doeth the Lorde threaten, that he wyll doe thus: for sithens thei doe preferre their own wisdom before the wysedome of God, doe they

not well deserue (I praye you) to haue that wisdome, whiche God had geuen them for to bestowe to hys own glory, to be taken awaye from them? So that the saying of S. Paul is fulfilled in them, wher he sayth:Roma. 1. when they counted them|selues wyse, they became fooles. For why? When they knew God, they glorified him not nor yet wor+shipped hym as god. For yf they woulde haue worshipped hym as God, they would not haue sought other maner wayes to worshyppe and serue him, than he hymselfe hath appoynted.
To be shorte the rewarde of the~, that wyll not submitte them selues to the euerlastyng worde of God, and serue hym after the phansyes of mens dreames,The re|warde of mens phan+syes and dreames is to haue theyr foolyshe hartes blinded with vai~e imaginations, and to be geuen vp into their owne lustes. Wherefore

I woulde counsel all men to bee|ware of them,Ambrosi|us de virgi+nibus. li. 4. and to say with that holy father S. Ambrose: Nos no|ua omnia, que Christus non docuit iureda~namus: quia fidelibus via Christus est. Si igitur Christus non docuit, quod docemus, etiam nos id detestabile iudicamus. We doe by a good ryght condemne all newe thynges,Idem in 1. Corin. 4. that Christe hath not taught therfore if Christ hath not taught that, which we teache, we iudge it also to be detestable. And no merueill, for in an other place he sayeth playnly, that what soeuer hath not been set forth by y^e Apostls, y^e sa~e is ful of wickednes
And wyl ye bynde vs to be obe+dyente to that, which is detestable and wycked?


Priest.
I say stil, that subiectes ought not to busy them|selues about Princes matters. For as ye heard already, if their lawes bee naughte and wycked, then

they their selues shall aunswere for it.


Prentise.
In dede in thynges, that appertayne to ciuill lawes, constitutions and ordeynaunces, whyche magistrates be wonte too make for the preseruatyon of the commen weale, we oughte to laye asyde all busye and curyous que|stenyng.
For if their lawes be not accor+dyng to iustice and equite, or if by their wicked statuts their subiects be oppressed, they shall receaue aco~+dygne punishme~t at the righteous hand of God: yea the blood of the~, y^t shal perysh through their vnrigh+teousse lawes, shalbe required at theyr handes.
And thys is the other kynde of ordeinaunces made by manne, wherunto, as I haue sayd before, we ought to be obedyent, and that wythoute any exceptyon, as farre

forth as they be nothing repugna~t to godlynesse and Christian chari|tye.
And wythout all peraduenture S. Peter speaketh ther in the place afore alleaged of thys kynd of or|deynaunces.
Howbeit, if both the Greke and la+tyne be well weyed, we shal soone perceaue that Peter doeth here set forth the same selfe doctrine, which Paul himselfe doeth teache in the 13. to the Romaynes: for the Greke wordes are these: hypotagete pase anthropine ctisei, and Erasmus doeth translate them after thys maner: Subditi estote cuiuis hu|mane creature.
And in Englyshe they may be translated thus: be subiecte to all humayne creature, or to all menne. For although thys worde, ctisis, may be taken for ordeynaunce: yet by the texte that foloweth, it appea+peareth

it ought rather to be taken as Erasmus hath tra~slated. Mark wel the circumstances of the texte youre selfe, and reade that, which foloweth immediatly after y^e same sentence, that ye haue broughte in: and than, I trust, ye wyll confesse my saying to be true.


Priest.
What foloweth I praye you? For I per|ceue y^t ye are a doctour.


Prentise.
I would be glad to be a disciple, ma|ster person, if I could fynde such a doctour, as would teache nothyng els but true Godlynesse.
The woordes that folowe are these: or rather that we maye vn|derstand the whole matter the bet+ter, I wyl repete the whole se~te~ce: I meane both your texte, and that whych foloweth.


Priest.
Wel, do so.Peter. 2.


Prentyse.
Submitte youre selfs vnto all maner ordynaunce of ma~, or as Erasmus translateth, to all maner creature, for the Lords sake,

whether it be vnto the king, as vn+to the chiefe heade, other vnto ru+lers, as vnto them that are sent of him for the punishment of euil do+ers, but for the laude of them that doe wel.
Thys texte, I trow, is playne en+ough, so that we nede no longer tarying aboute it.


Priest.
Saye ye what ye will, I will be of thys o|pinion as long as I lyue, that the subiectes shall bee excused beefore God, if they folowe and obey the lawes of y^e higher powers, be they neuer so wicked and vngodly.


Pre~+tyse.
And that mayster person is a deuilyshe and abominable opinio~.Subiectes shal not be excused, if they folow wycked  vngodly lawes. Math. 15. Doeth not Christ say: if the blinde doe leade the blinde, they shall fall both into the diche? He sayeth not that y^e leader only or guide shal fal, but y^t they shal both fal. And y^e like reade we in y^e prophete Hieremy, wher he saith, y^t both y^e fals prophet

and also they, that harke~ vnto the~, shal perysh with swerde,Hier. 14. with hu~|ger, and wyth pestilence.


Pryeste.
Doeth not the Prophete Ezechiel saye playnly,Ezechi. 3.  33. that the blood of the shepe shalbe requyred at the shepe+heardes handes? Ye wyll not deny that the higher powers in the scrip+tures and also in prophane autors ar called Pastores populi, that is to say, the shepeheardes of the peo+pell.


Prentise.
I graunt, that they be Pastores populi: that is to say, the shepeheardes of the people, and y^t their shepes blood shalbe required at theyr handes.
But what shall thys be for the easemente of the poore shepe? The Prophete sayeth that they shall pe+rysh, and not only the shepeherds: whose damnacion in dede shall be the greater, because that they shall not onelye answere for their owne

sinnes, but also for the losse of the~, that were of God committed into their handes.
But, as I haue already sayed, that shal bee but a small helpe and comfort for them, when they their selues, beeynge in the euerlastynge paynes of hell, whereunto they ar brought through the neglygence  wicked lawes of their shepherds, shall see them to suffer greater pu+nyshment, than they dooe their selues.
I would fayne aske you a que|styon, master person.


Priest.
Aske what ye wyll.


Prentyse.
Is it law+full for the inferior magystrates, to make lawes co~trary to y^e lawes of the higher power?


Pryeste.
No by S. Mary.


Prentyse.
What if the inferiour magistrates shoulde presume to make any suche lawes?


Pryest.
I woulde counte them no better tha~

treatours.


Prentis.
And what wyl ye say of them, that know the high+er powers lawes, and yet layinge them asyde, folowe and obeye the lawes, y^t the inferiour magistrats haue made?
As for an example: if the de|pute of Cales should take presump+tuously vpon hym, to set forth sta+tutes contrarye to the Quenes lawes: what woulde ye iudge hym to be, and all them, that woulde o|beye hys statutes and commaun|dementes?


Prieste.
I woulde iudge hym to be a treatoure, and all the o|ther to be as accessories vnto him.


Prentyse.
Ye knowe ryght wel ma+ster person, that they that be acces|soryes vnto any euill and wycked dede, as vnto treason, thefte, mur|ther and other lyke, doe receaue the same punishment, that the wycked

doers are condemned to.


Prieste.
No doubt therof.


Prentise.
verye well, what saye ye nowe, is not the lyuing God, the father of oure Lorde Iesu Chryste, the hygheste Monarche of all? And haue not all the kinges and Prynces of the earth their po|wer and autorite from hym?


Pryeste.
Yeas truely. For the Psalmist sayeth not onely, that he is a greate God,Psalm. 95. but that he is a great kynge aboue all Goddes. And Sayncte Paule in the .13. to y^e Romaynes wryteth,Roma. 13. that there is no power but of God, and that al the powers, that bee, are ordayned of God.


Prentyse.
It reioyseth my hearte to heare you speake so wel. Is it lawfull then for the rulers, kynges and Prynces of the earth to make any statutes, decrees,

and lawes contrarye to the com|maundement of theyr high Mo|narche and kyng, from whom they haue and receaue all the autorytye and power, that thei haue?


Priest.
They ought in no wyse so to dooe: for as Chryste doeth bydde vs, to pay that vnto Ceasar, which is due vnto Ceasar:Mat. 22. Mark. 12 Luke. 20 so doeth he co~mau~de vs, to paye that vnto God, y^t is due vnto God. If God then wil haue that to be payed vnto Cesar, that is to say, to the ciuill magistrates, ru+lers and gouernours, that by hys owne appoyntmente is due vnto them: what an ingratitude and vn+thankfulnesse should it be, if they wold let men to pay that vnto god, which is of al men due vnto hym? I woulde verelye counte them no lesse then ranke traitours?


Prentis
And what is your iugement of the~, that obeye theyr wicked lawes and vnlawfull commaundementes?



Priest.
I must nedes confesse, that they are accessoryes vnto them,  consequently that they shalbe par|takers of the same punishmente, that such wycked and vngodly ru|lers shall by the righteous iudge|ment of god receaue at length.


Pre~+tyse.
Thys, that ye say, master per|son, is most true, and therfore that holy man S. Bernarde, wryting to a certayne Moonke called Adam,bernardus in epist. ad Adam mo|nachu~ epi.  sayeth these wordes: we oughte in no wyse to obeye them, that com|maunde wycked thynges: for that were to breake the hygher obedy|ence, that is to say, the obedience y^t we owe vnto God, for to obeye in+ferioure and humayne creatures. What then? That thynge, whyche man commaundeth, God doth for+bydde.
And shal I geue eares vnto ma~, beeyng defe to god? The Apostles did not so, but cryed out sayi~g: bet+ter

it is to obeye God then men. And by and by he concludeth: Ig|tur facere malum,Actes. 5. quolibet etiam iubente, constat non esse obedien+tiam, sed potius inobedientiam. That is to say: therfore to doe euil at the commaundement of any ma~ it is playne and euident, that it is no obedience but rather disobedi|ence.Hierony|mus in epi. ad Titum. cap. 1.
Saincte Hierome wryteth on thys maner: if that, which the Em+peroure or hys depute doeth com|maunde, be good, obeye or folowe the wil of hym, that co~mau~deth it: but if it be naught or wycked, and agaynste God, aunswere them out of the Actes of the Apostles: bet|ter it is to obeye God than menne.Ambro. ad Marcelly|nam sorore~ de traden|dis Basili|cis. S. Ambrose sayeth playnlye, that thynges, whyche appertayne vnto God or vnto Gods seruyce, ar not in the Emperours power: meani~g that kings and Emperours ought

to meddell no farther in thynges, that appertayne to Goddes true seruice, than he himselfe hath ap|poynted them in his holy  sacred worde.
And out of thys holy father, is there a most notable saying,Que. 3. Can. Iulia+nus. reher+ced in y^e canon lawes on this wise: Iulianus the Emperour, thoughe he was an Apostata, yet had he vn+der hym Chrystyan souldyers: who, when he sayed to them, bring forth weapons for the defense of y^e commen weale, wer most obedie~t, but when he sayd vnto the~: bringe forth your armoure and weapons agaynst the Chrystyans, they then acknowledged the heauenly Em|peroure.
But aboue all thynges, the golden sentences of Sainct Augu+styne are to bee marked, where he

wryteth thus. Emperours, when they theyr selues are in errour,Augusti. epist. 169. doe for y^e defense of their erroure make lawes agaynst the trueth, whereby the righteous are both tryed and crowned: but not in doynge that, whyche they commaunde: for god forbyddeth it, as when Nabucho donosor commaunded that the gol|den Image shoulde bee worship|ped.
They, that would not doe it, ple+sed God highly, who forbyddeth suche thynges. But when Empe|rours are in the way of trueth, and make lawes for the trueth agaynst erroure: whosoeuer doeth co~temne such lawes,Augu. Bo|nifacio co|miti de mo+derate coer|cendis here+ticis. doeth purchase vnto hymselfe great damnacion. And ad bonifacium comitem, de moderate cohercendis hereticis, these be hys wordes: whosoeuer wil not obeye the Emperours lawes, which are made agaynst the trueth of God,

doth purchase vnto himselfe a greate rewarde. And whosoeuer will not obeye the Emperours lawes, that ar made for the trueth, doeth purchase vnto hymselfe a great punishmente.
The lyke in a maner is alleaged out of this holye father in the ca|non lawes.Que. 3. ca. non se~per.


Pryest
These autory|tes, that ye haue brought, ar verye Godly. And in good fayth, I can|not but prayse you for your greate diligence, that ye haue vsed in rea|dyng both the scriptures and aun|cye~t wryters.
But are ye able to brynge exam+ples out of the scriptures of any of them, that woulde not obeye vnto godly statuts and lawes.


Prentis.
Ye as very many.Dani. 3. Sidrach Misach Abednago
Sidrach, Misach, and Abedn|ago were in all thynges moste obe+dyent vnto kyng Nabuchodono|sor, as longe as he commaunded

them no vngodlinesse, in so much that for their true seruice and obe+dience, they were in hygh fauoure with the kynge: but after that Na+buchodonosor began to doubte, and did sette vp a golden Idolle, willing that honour too be geuen vnto it, that ought onelye  solely to be geuen vnto God, they wold in no wyse be obedie~t, but choose rather to be cast in to the burning fornace. With what stomack and boldenesse, when they were cal|led before the kyng, aunswered they? saying: Hoc notum sit tibi, O Rex, quod Deos tuos non co|imus, neque adorabimus aureum simulachrum, quod erexisti.
That is to saye: Lette thys bee knowen vnto the,Daniel. 6. O Kynge, that we dooe not worshippe thy goddes, nor will worshyppe thy golden Image, that thou haste

sefte vp.
Daniel hym selfe, who was in greate fauoure with three kin|ges, that is too saye with Nabu|chodonosor, Elmerodache and Balthasar, when a Lawe was made by the procurement of all y^e Lordes of Persie, that if anye man shoulde aske any thynge by the space of thyrty dayes, eyther of anye GOD or of anye man, but of kynge Darius onelye, he shoulde be casten in to the denne of the Lyons, woulde in no wyse obeye: but accordynge to hys wonte custome prayed thryse in the daye, hys chaumber wyn|dowes beinge wyde open, wher|by he was disclosed and accused to the prince, and euen then de|nyed it not, thoughe he shoulde too the Lions for it. What nede I to reherce here y^e moste notable

example of Eleazarus that God|ly olde scribe? When that cruel ti|rant Antiochus had made a very straite law,2. Ma. 7 that as many of the Ie+wes, as woulde not eate swines flesh, should be most cruelly put to death, this godly olde scribe would rather dye, than to breake Gods lawe.
And whe~ certayne of his fre~ds cou~seled him to feine himselfe as he had eaten swynes fleshe,2. Ma. 9. promi+sing him, that he shold by y^e meane saue hys lyfe, he coulde not finde in hys heart to dissemble, but offe+red himselfe manfully to dye. What shoulde we speake here of y^e ii. yong men and of their mother? How many and sundri waies wer they tempted to breake the co~mau~|dementes of god, now with cruell threatninges, now wyth fayre  flatteryng promyses? And yet no|thyng could make them to swarue

one iotte fro~ the law of the liuinge god, but suffered al a moste horri|ble and cruel death with their mo|ther. As for the example of the A|postles, it hath been alleaged alre|dye.

I knowe y^e ma|nye honeste men are slaundered to haue preached sedicion and diso|bedience, because they haue taught how farre forth men ought to bee obedient to the ciuil magistrates: but al men of vpright iudgement, that haue heard them, can beare witnes to the contrary. For alwais in their sermons they dyd most di+ligently exhort the people to true o+bedie~ce towards their magistrats putting before their eies the plags and vengeaunce of god, that hath at al times and in all ages happe|ned

to them, that haue rebelled a|gaynst their rulers  gouernors, were they neuer soo wicked and vngodly.


Priest.
Is not this a kinde of rebellion, when they wil not obeye their lawes and statu|tes?


Prentyse.
I haue alreadye proued vnto you, that we oughte in nowyse to be obedient too wic|ked and vngodlye statutes or la|wes. This, I say, haue I already proued by playn textes of y^e scrip+tures, by manifeste examples of the same,  by manye notable au|thorities of the auncie~t wryters. Howebeit I will be of this opi|nion, as longe as I lyue, that it were better for a Christian to dye a thousande deathes, than once to drawe the swearde against his lawfull magistrate. If God send vs at any time suche magistrates as be vngodly, lette vs remoue or put away y^e causes, wherfore god did send them vnto vs:  then god

will eyther turne their harts, and make them such, as we wold haue them, or els if they be geuen ouer into their own lusts, take the~ awai  place other in their roumes.


Priest.
What be the causes, wher|fore God doeth send vngodly ma+gistrates vnto vs?


Pre~tyse.
Sine: for the scripture sayeth: Regnare facit hypocritam Deus propter peccata populi, y^t is to saye: God causeth an hypocrite too reygne for the syns of the people. And in Esaie it is writte~ on this ma~ner:Esaie. 3. I shal geue you chyldren to be youre princes, saieth the Lord,  babes shal haue y^e rule of you. And why? because, saieth y^e prophete, youre wordes  counseyll are agaynste the Lord, prouoking the presence of his maiestie vnto anger.
The surest weapons then, that we can haue, to fyghte with|all agaynst wicked and vngodly

rulers, is true repentaunce and a|mendement of lyfe, faythful and vnfeined prayer, proceadyng from a troubled and contrite heart. And they, that vse any other armure or weapons, are not of God, but are the children of Belial by suche vn+lawfull meanes, as they doe vse, pourchassyng vnto themselues e|uerlastyng damnatyon. Now ma|ster person, I trust ye haue suffici+ently heard my mynde, touchynge the obedience that we owe vnto magistrates, and how farre forth we ar bound to obeie their lawes.


Priest.
But what meaneth Sainct Paul,Rom. 13. when he saieth: wherfore ye must nedes obeye, not for feare of vengeaunce only, but also because of conscience.
Here are men bounde in consci|ence to obeye. What wyll ye haue more?


Prentyse.
The meanyng of Sayncte Paule is thys, that we

must obeye our temporall rulers, not onely for feare of the punish|ment and vengeaunce, that ensu|eth and foloweth of disobedie~ce, but also because oure conscience doeth beare vs recorde, that it is gods will and pleasure, that wee shoulde obeye them. That is too saye: Althoughe it were possible y^t we might escape all worldely pu|nishment and shame, that cometh of disobedience and rebellion, yet because in oure conscience we are by Gods worde perswaded, that all the hygh powers are of God, we can not (onelesse we wolde co~|demne our own selfs) but be obe|dient vnto them, as longe as thei kepe them selfes within the bou~|des and limites of gods boke: for if they commau~de any thing, that God hath forbidden, or forbidde any thinge, that God hath co~mau~+ded: we ought to say with y^e Apo|stelles:

Better it is to obeye God than men.Actes. 5.


Prieste.
And hath not God co~maunded confession?


Prentyse.
No suche kinde of con|fession doeth God co~maunde, as is vsed now at this present. And truely I doe merueyll, that ye bee not ashamed emo~g you, to affirme that auricular confessio~ is of god,Auricular confession is not of God. or that it is grounded in goddes worde. For though it hath ben vsed in times passed, yet was it then free for all men, whether thei wolde come to it or not. The histo+ries do playnlye declare, yea and many auncient writers besydes, that ther was no law at all made concerninge this auriculare con|fession, which ye do with to the  nayle defend now, afore Innoce~|tius the thyrde: and that it was a polityke order instituted by the bishoppes, but not a lawe ordey|ned

either of Christe or of hys Apostles.De penit|tia distinc. 1. Therfore Gratianus, after a long disputation, conclu|deth at lengthe the whole matter with these wordes: I haue briefli set fourth and declared, what au|tours, or what reasons and argu|ments bothe sentences are groun+ded vpo~: but we leaue to the iud|gement of the reader, which of the~ he will folowe and stycke to. And he,Distinc. . that hath writte~ the glose of the fyrst boke, doeth playnelye affirme, that we are onely bounde by mans lawe to this confession, and that therefore the Greckes were neuer bounde to it, because thys lawe was neuer receyued of them.
Whiche thing any man wolde haue iudged Diuelyshe and abo|minable, if thys confession hadde ben commaunded by Christe.

Sozomenus writeth, that this in|stitution and ordeynaunce was di+ligently obserued and kepte in the weaste churches,Trip li. 9. and speciallye at Rome: wherbi he signifieth that it was not a generall law of all chur+ches, and that one priest amo~g al o+ther was appointed to this office: wherin also he dooeth confute the lying opinio~ of the~, which affirme that the keyes are deliuered vni|uersally to al priestes for this pur+pose: for it was not the office of all priestes too confesse, but one onely was appointed to it by the Bishop.


Priest.
And was this co~|fession vsed onelye in the Occi|dentalle or Weaste churches? This is a straunge thinge, that ye do tell.


Prentyse.
The same Sozo|menus doeth also testifie, that it was vsed at Constantinople, vn|till abominable whoredome and adultry was shamfully co~mitted

betwene a Deacon  a noble woe+man, vnder the pretence of it. For this enorme and detestable cryme dyd Nectarius, being a holy and godly man, abolishe auricular co~|fession: whiche Nectarius was then bishop of Constantinople. Now marke this thinge, mayster Personne: if this had ben y^e lawe of God, Nectarius durste not haue put it doune. Will ye accuse this holy man (who of all men is so , commended) of heresye? Or will ye condemne the churche of Constantinople, whiche neuer after that tyme woulde admitte  receaue auricular confessio~ Yea, not onely the church of Constan|tinople, but also all the East chur|ches haue ben always at defiau~ce with this Antichristian traditio~. Wold they haue ben against it, if it had ben y^e institutio~ of Christe? Chrisostome, who was also bis|shop

of that churche (I meane, of the church of Consta~tinople) doth so plainly testifye the same in all his writings, y^t I merueyl, they be not ashamed once too opene theyr mouths to defende it. Tell furthe thy syns (sayeth he) y^t thou maiest put them awaye. If thou be asha|med to tell to any man what thou hast done amysse,Rome. 2. in Psal. 51. tell thy synnes euery daye in thy mynde. I bidde not the to telle them to thy felow seruaunt, who may bewraye the: but telle them to God, which hea|leth them. Telle furth thine offen|ces vpon thy bedde, that there thy conscience may acknowledge and recognyse hir owne wickednesse. And in an other place:Ser. de co~|fessione et penitentia. Now is it nothinge necessarie, sayeth thys holy father, to confesse oure selfs before witnesses, lette a diligent inquisition of thy sinnes be made in thy thought, this triall be done

without witnesse: let God alone see thee, wherein thou doest con|fesse thy self.Ro. 5. de incompre. Dei natura contra Ana+meos. And in hys 5. home|lye de incomprehensibli Dei natu+ra contra Anameos, these be hys wordes: I do not bringe thee in to the scafold of thy felow seruau~+tes. I do not compelle the to con|fesse, detecte or open thy synnes vnto men: repete thy conscience before God, ope~ thy mynde, shew thy wondes vnto the Lorde, that most excellent Phisition, and call for helpe at his handes: shewe the~ to hym, that vpbraydeth nothing, but wil heale them most gentilly. Besydes all these, he sayeth in an other place: Beware thou tell not thy faute vnto man,Ro. 4. de Lazaro. lest he do vp|brayede the, for we are not bound to co~fesse our selfs to our fellowe seuraunt, y^t may vpbrayede  vtter abrode our co~fession. But shewe thy wou~des to God, who is care|full

ouer thee, who is gentill,  a sure Phisicion. Afterwardes he doth induce or bring in God, spea+king on this ma~ner: I do not com+pelle thee to come furth in to y^e co~|mune scaffold,  to call for manye witnesses? Tell thy sinnes to me alone priuely, y^t I may heale y^e so|res. Wil ye sai y^t Chrisostome was so far out of y^e wai, y^t he wold haue set me is co~sciences at libertie, fro~ comming to such kynd of co~fessio~, if they hadde ben bounde to it by Goddes lawes? No no, mayster person, but he durst not require y^t as a thynge necessary, whiche he knewe was not prescrybed  com+maunded in Gods woorde.

Prentyse.
Why ma|ster person,Luk. 7.10. Mar. 1. did he sende hym to shrifte?
Who euer knewe that the priestes of the Leuiticall lawe wer appoin+ted to shriue men? But nowe good master person, waigh wyth youre selfe, how well thys place serueth for your purpose. When dyd euer Christ send lepers to the priestes? afore or after they weere made clene?


Priest.
What question is that? No doubte, he healed them afore he sent them to the priestes.


Prentyse.
Very wel, if ye wil then haue this place to serue for your purpose: it shoulde folow that we must be healed of our leprosye, y^t is to saye,Mark how wel y^e place alleaged by the priest serueth for hym. that we must haue clen remission of our sinnes afore we shoulde come to you. Wherefore then will ye haue vs too tell you our sinnes, with all the circu~strau~|ces thai may be, perswadinge the

simple and ignoraunt people, that onles they tel you all theyr sinnes one by one,  receaue absolution at your hande, they shall neuer be forgeuen? Thys is altogether a|gaynst your own lawes. For in y^e booke de penitentia distinc. 1 Ca+non. Cum ergo.De peni. Distin. 1. Cano. cum ergo. these wordes are founde: it doeth plainly appeare, that synne is forgeuen throughe the contrition of the heart, wyth|out y^e co~fessio~ of y^e mouth. And the~ a litel after it foloweth: synne is not forgeuen in confession: for it is manifestly proued that it is al+ready forgeuen. Therfore confes|syon is made for a declaracion of repentaunce, not for obtayninge of forgeuenes. And agaynste the tellyng out of synnes after youre sorte, one by one wyth the circum+staunces and all,Augu. li. 10 confess. ca. 3 we haue these wordes of S. Augustine: what haue I to doe therfore w^t men, y^t

they should heare my confessyo~s, althogh thei wer able to heale al my diseases  infirmites? A curi|ouse  busye kynde of people to know an other mannes lyfe, but slouthful to correct their owne. And why seke they to heare of me what I am, that will not haue thee to heare, what they be? And when they heare me speak of my selfe, howe can they tell, whether I say truth or not? For no ma~ kno+weth what is in ma~, but y^e spirite of ma~ that is in him. It is also al|leaged in y^e decres out of S. Chri+sostome, y^e such enumeratio~ or tel+lyng out of synnes is nothyng ne+cessary.


Priest.
Ye brynge many thynges, to draw me awaye from my purpose. But I wil not suffer you to escape. Thys was Moses lawe, that the Priestes shoulde iudge of Leprosye:Leui. 13.14.15. synne is spy|rytuall Leprosye: ergo Priestes

ought to geue sentence or iudge|ment of it.


Pre~tyse.
If this place doeth make you iudges of y^e spiri|tuall leprosye, why do ye not also take vpon you the handelinge of the naturall and carnall leprosye? Is not this to play with the scrip+tures? The law hath put the tryal of leprosye in to the priestes han|des, let vs take the same vpon vs. Synne is spirituall leprosy, ther|fore let vs also be the iudges and tryers of synnes: But ye shall vn|derstande, that the priesthode, be|inge tra~slated, the lawe also must necessarely be translated.Hebru. 7. All the whole priestehode is translated vnto Christ, fulfilled and fynished in hym: therfore to hym onely ap|perteyneth the whole right  ho|noure of the priesthoode. If ye haue suche a delighte too folowe Allegoryes, appoynte Christ too be the onely priest, geuynge hym

the whole authoritie, and then ca~ we abyde your allegoryes. But we can not awaye with those alle|gories, that make of a mere poli|tike lawe a ceremonie.


Prieste.
But why did God co~maunde in the olde lawe, y^t the priestes shuld haue the handeling  trial of the leprosye? Or why did Christ se~d the leapers, after they were cured and healed, vnto the priests, bid|dinge them to offer that, whiche Moyses commaunded for a wit|nesse vnto them?


Prentyse.
The holy Ghost willed the priestes of the olde testament to haue y^e trial of leprosye,Why God wold haue y^e pryest of the old law to haue the handlynge of the lepro+sye. that when men shulde see the priestes of God to haue y^e handeling of leprosye, they might by that sight, be admonished, that God looketh vpon oure infirmy|ties, and is carefull for them. Secondely, because the leuiticall priesthod was a shadow  figure,

not of these Popishe sacrificers, that most vntruly take vpon the~ the names of Pryestes, but of y^e most pure and holy Pryest, oure sauyoure Iesu Chryst: the holye gost by thys institution doeth cer+tifie vs, that as the Leuiticall priestes had not onelye the hand|lyng and tryall of Leprosye, but also offered expiatorye sacrifices for it, so our sauiour Chryst alone knoweth truely our filthines, and seeyng it worthy of euerlastynge damnacion, hath taken vpon him to make satisfaction for it, that we beeyng through hym reconcyled to God, may obteine true clenely|nes.


Priest.
But this y^t Chryst dyd when he sent the lepers vnto the Priestes,Whi christ did send y^e lepers to y^e pryestes. is in the newe testame~t. Therfore it can be no figure.


Pre~|tise.
It was for two causes, that Chryst dyd sende the lepers to y^e Priestes. First ye shal vndersta~d,

that the Priestes beeyng vtter enemyes of Chryst,  of his most holy doctryne, dyd alwayes sla~|der hys doynges, goyng about to perswade the people, that he did not woorke true miracles, but throughe legerdemayne deceaued them. If then the priestes sholde receaue agayne those lepers into the congregacyon of the cleane, those lepers I say, that Christ se~te vnto them, takyng at theyr hande the gyfte, whyche Moses com|maunded to be offered vnto them for their clensyng, that must haue been an other day a plain witnes agaynst them, if they shoulde goe aboute to calu~niate Christes mi|racles. Seco~dly Christ, because he woulde not seme to be a breaker of Moses lawe, whych was inful strength vntil his death  passio~, dyd alwayes sende those lepers, that he dyd heale, to the same

Leuiticall Priestes, commaun|dyng them strayghtly, to offer y^e gyfte, whyche Moses willed the~ to offer, that so he myght on euery syde stope their mouthes. Reade Chrysostome in the .12. Homili de muliere Can.Chri. Ho. 12. de muli Cana. Am. ser. 3. in. 119. psa. What nede we too tary any longer about this mater: Doeth not the blessed Sainct Am+brose in hys. 3. sermon vpon the 119. Psalme write on this maner? goe shew thy self vnto the pryest. What is thys true Pryest (sayeth he) but he, who is priest for euer?


Priest.
Yet can ye not denye that synne is signified by the leprosie. And that the lepers dyd represe~t synners.


Prentyse.
Putte the case I graunte the same vnto you: what haue ye wonne by it? Euen that synners oughte to repayre to the ministers of gods worde, there to learne by their wholsome prechi~g

instruction and teachynge out of gods boke, how to repente truely and how to take holde throughe fayth vpon the mercye of God, beeynge offered vnto all true re|pentaunt synners in the gospell of our sauioure Iesu Chryste: but ye shall neuer be able to proue, y^t they are bonde to tell oute theyr synnes vnto them, or to receaue suche beggerly absolutyo~ at their handes, as is nowe vsed in Anty|christes churche.


Priest.
What can ye say to this place of S. Mathewe:Math. 16. I wil geue the, sayth Chryst to Peter, y^e keyes of the kyngdome of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou bindest in earth shall be bounde in heauen,  what soeuer thou loosest on earth, shal be loosed in heauen. And in the. 18 chap. of the same gospel, these be our sauiours wordes to all his A|postles.Math. 18. Verely I saye vnto you,

whatsoeuer ye bide on earth, shal be bou~de in heaue~. And whatsoe|uer ye loose on earth, shalbe loo|sed in heauen. And also in the .19. chap of Iohns gospel, he sayeth: receaue y^e holy gost. Whose soeuer synnes ye doe forgeue,Ioh. 19. they are forgeuen vnto the~. And whose so|euers synnes ye retayne, they are retayned.
The places doe sufficiently de+clare, that Pryestes haue receued of Chryst the autorite and power to forgeue synnes.


Prentise.
I wil cirst, master person, vnder youre correction and leaue, shewe what the scripture vnderstandeth by y^e keyes, and than shal any man ease+ly perceaue and see, how shamful|ly these places haue hertofore bee~ wrasted and wrighed. The keyes, sayeth that worthy Chrysostome,Chriso. in math. 23. Hom. 44. are the worde of God and y^e know+ledge of the scriptures, whereby y^e

gate of trueth is opened vnto me~. And the kepers of them are the Priestes, to whom the offyce of preachyng the worde and expou~|dyng the scriptures is commyt|ted. Thys is to be called the keye, wryteth saynte Augustyne, wher wyth the harde hartes are resol|ued to receaue fayth,Aug. Ser. 27, de sanc|tis. the secretes of the myndes opened, and what soeuer lurketh wythin, is by a rea+sonable way broughte to lyghte, That, I say, is the true keye, that openeth the conscyence to true co~|fessyon of synne, and includeth or shutteth in grace to the eternite of an wholsome mysterie. To this a greeth that holy father Ambrose, saying:De peni. di 1. Can. Ver+bum. verbum dei. The woorde of God remytteth synnes, the Priest is the iudge in deede, the Priest doth his duety and office, but he exerciseth no maner power

nor iurisdiction. And in an other place these be hys wordes:Liber. de cain et Abell. Pec|cata per verbu~ dimittuntur. Sin+nes are forgeuen by the worde, y^e interpreter wherof is the Leuite. Now is it playne and euydent en+oughe, what we oughte to vnder|sta~de by the keyes: euen the true worde of God and the righte vn+derstandynge of the scryptures: wherby the conscyences of true repentaunte synners are loosed and set at liberte from synne and euerlastyng damnacion, and y^e co~s+ciences of them, that be hardened in their wicked maliciousnes, and wyll in no wyse repente, bou~d w^t the dolefull chaynes of sinne, and of helly destructyon. And y^t thys is the true meanynge and vnder|standyng of the keies Chryst him selfe doeth sufficientlye declare, when he sendeth his apostles a|brode into the worlde, to preach y^e

gospell, o penyng the misterye of byndynge and loosynge on thys wyse: goe ye throughoute all the whole worlde,Mark. 16. and preache y^e gos|pel to all lyuyng creatures: here bee the keyes delyuered vnto the~: he, that beleueth and is baptysed, shalbe saued: but he that beleueth not shalbe condemned. And in the 24 chap. of Luke, Christ sayth on thys maner:Luke. 24. thus it is wrytten,  thus it behoued Chryst to suffer and to ryse agayne from death y^e thirde daye, and that repentau~ce and remission of synnes shoulde be preached in hys name amonge all nacions.
The woorde of God then, and the preachyng of the gospell, are the keyes y^t Chryste doeth speake of. And when the faythfull mini|sters of Gods worde doe,Whst is to binde and louse. by due mynistryng and preachyng of y^e gospel, certifie the repentaunt sin+ners

of the remission and forge|uenesse of their synnes in y^e bloud of our sauiour Iesu Christ, they louse them, so that they are also loused in heauen: but when on y^e contrarie they do a certayne them (because of their vnrepentaunte hartes) of the wrath and indigna+tion of God, and of euerlastinge damnation, excepte they forsake their wicked wayes, and turne vn+feynedly vnto the Lorde theyr God, they binde them so, y^t doubt lesse they ar also bound in heaue~.
And by thys byndyng and loo+sing Christ our sauiour vndersta~|deth none other thyng, but remit|ting and retaining of synnes. And it is saied, that the minister doth forgeue sinnes, because that he, as a man myght saye, sitting in commission vnder hys mayster Chryst, doth out of hys mouthe certifie y^e co~sciences of true repen+tau~t

sinners of the free remissio~  forgeuenes of their sinnes in th blood of y^e so~e of god, apprehe~ded  take~ hold vpo~ by faith. For to sai y^t me~ ca~ forgeue sines, it is a mere blasphemy agai~st god, which thi~g the very Pharises  Scribs their sels do testifie, saying: whi doth he speake these blasphemies?Marke. 2. who ca~ forgeue synnes but god onely? These Pharises  Scribes shall rise at y^e day of iudgement,  con|de~ne our Pharisaical hipocrites, y^t so arragau~tly take vpo~ the~ to for|geue me~ their sinnes.


Priest.
And haue we not power to forgeue o|ther me~ their sinnes, but by y^e way of co~missio~?


Pre~tyse.
No forsoth. And yet this co~missio~ must be du+ly executed accordyng to y^e wyll  pleasure of him y^t hath geue~ it: els it wil be worth , thogh it hath neuer so gloriouse a face in y^e site of y^e world.


pri.
I wil beleue

touchynge thys matter, as the ho|ly fathers haue beleued  taught afore vs. But they haue both bee+leued and taught, that y^e Pryestes haue power and authorite to for|geue synnes.
Therfore ye maye prate what ye lyst, as a sorte of newe fangled heades that ye bee, I wyll stycke to the olde catholyke churche, as long as I haue any breath in my bodye.


Prentyse.
I wyll not haue you to take the matter so hotte, master person, but let vs rather wyth all lenite and gentylnes reason the matter together, that there maye come some edifying of it. I doubt not but that ye remember the say|ing of Ciprian full well, where he sayeth: and that Chryst oughte on+ly to be heard, the father also dyd testifie from heauen, saying. This is my welbeloued sonne, in who~

I am pleased, heare him. Where|fore, if Christ oughte to be hearde onely, we must not regarde, what any man hath afore vs thoughte good to be done, but what Christ, who is afore all, dyd fyrst. For we ought in nowise to folow ma~s custome, but the trueth of God. And doeth not the Lord our god crye out in the prophete Ezechiell saying:Eze. 20. Walke not in the statutes of your forfathers, kepe not their ordenaunces, and defyle not your selfes with their Idols: for I am the Lord your God. But walke in my statutes, kepe my lawes,  do them? Verely maister Person, the religion of oure forefathers shall not excuse vs.God onely forgeueth synnes. But what will ye saye, if I can proue by the say|inges and authorities of the most auncient fathers, that no man can forgeue synne but God onely?


Prieste.
Let me heare what ye ca~

saye.Cyrillus in Io. 12. cap. 56.


Prentyse.
Cyrillus writing vpon Ihon, speaketh these woor|des: Truely it lyeth onely in the power of God to louse men from their synnes. For who can deliuer the transgressors of the law from synne, but onely the autour of the lawe? And by and by it foloweth in the same place: For when they (meaninge the Apostles  other ministers) forgeue and retayne synnes, it is not they that do it, but the holy Ghost that dwelleth in them, he it is that forgeueth  retayneth by them. Whereunto agreeth sainct Augustin, writing contra epistolam Petiliani.Aug. co~tra epi. Peti. lib. 2. ca. 11. For, hauing touched this place of S. Ihons gospell: Receyue the holy Ghoste, whose synnes soeuer ye forgeue, thei shalbe forgeuen, and whose synnes soeuer ye retayne, thei shalbe retayned, he doth ende

the matter with these wordes: It is sufficientlye shewed, that they do it not, but that the holy Ghost doeth it by them. As it is sayed in an other place: for it is not you y^t speake, but the holye Ghoste that is in you. In lyke maner Ambrose vpon the .2. Corin. 12.Ambro. in 2. Cor. 12. wryteth on this manner: It is only in the po|wer of God too remitte synnes  to geue the holye Ghoste. And agayne: He alone doeth forgeue synne, that alone dyed for oure synnes.
Lykewise Chrisostome vpon Matthewe:Chryso. in Mattheu~ ho. 5. The seruitude and boundage of synne, sayeth he, is very greuous and heauye, frome the whiche no manne can deliuer but God onely. For no man besy|des God hathe power to remitte or forgeue synne. Cyprian in hys sermones De lapsis saieth plainly thus:
The Lord alone can shew mercy, and geue pardon of those synnes: that are committed againste hym, he alone can graunt forgeuenesse of our synnes, that did beare our synnes, y^t sorowed for vs, whome God did deliuer vp to deathe for our synnes. Is it not than a blas|phemy intollerable, and in nowise to be suffered in y^e church of Christ that suche vyle persons, that haue neither godlinesse nor learninge, shoulde take vpon the~ that thing, that apperteineth only to god? If it were onely for this, your confes+sion is to be abhorred of all true Christian men.


Prieste.
Doeth not Christe saye these wordes:Mar. 11. when ye stande to praye, forgeue, if ye haue aughte againste any man?Math. 6. Agayne if ye will not forgeue men their offen|ces, my father that is in heauen shall not forgeue you. It appereth

by these textes, that men haue po|wer to forgeue synnes.


Prentyse.
Here doeth oure sauioure Iesu Christ speake of that mutual for|geuenesse of synnes and offences, that ought to be emo~g Christia~s, without the whiche we oughte to loke for no forgeuenesse at all of our own synnes at the handes of God.Eccle. 28. For as the wyse ma~ sayeth: He that seketh vengeaunce, shall fynde vengeaunce of the Lorde, whiche shall surely kepe hym hys synnes. Hereto maye be applyed all that whole parable, y^t Christe doeth set fourth at large in the .18. chapiter of Mathew.Math. 1. But it folo|weth not, because wee maye for|geue oure Christian brethren the offences and trespasses, that they haue done against vs, that we can therfore forgeue those offences  synnes, that are co~mitted against God.


Prieste.
Is not this to geue

power vnto the laye peopell too binde and to louse? Who can abyde this doctrine.


Prentyse.
Sainct Augustyn De verbis Do|mini geueth power vntoo the laye peopel to bynde and to louse,August. de verb. domi+ni, serm. 16 Theophi|lactus in Matth. 18. and also Theophilactus, whose woor|des be these. Verely I saye vntoo you: Whatsoeuer ye shall bynde vpon the earthe. If thou (sayeth he) being offended, doest counte him, that hath wronged thee, as a Publican and Heathen, he shalbe suche a one in heauen: But if thou lousest him, that is to saye, if thou forgeuest hym, it shall also be for|geuen hym in heauen. For not onely those thinges, that y^e priests do louse, are loused, but whatso|euer also wee, beinge wronged, do eyther louse or bynde, is bou~d or loused. What saye ye to thys, maister personne?


Prieste.
Well. I will bringe

an other texte of the scripture, whiche I truste will stoppe your mouth.Ioan. 11. When Christe did rayse Lazarus frome deathe, did not he commaunde his disciples to louse and vnbynde hym?
So when Christe hathe raised any synner frome the deathe of synne, who shal louse and vnbynd hym, but the priestes?


Prentyse.
Fyrste I aunswere, that allegories are nothing worth for the confirmatio~ and establish|ment of any doctrine. Secondely, where ye saye, that Christe com|maunded his Apostles, too louse and vnbynde Lazarus, ye ca~ not proue it by the scriptures. For it is rather to be thoughte, that he willed the Iewes, that stode by, to doe it, lest they shoulde thinke, that there was anye feininge in the myracle, and that his power myghte the better bee knowen,

in this, that he did without tou|chinge, with his worde and voice onely, rayse the dead.
It is rather too be expounded after this manner: Christe, to take awaye all euell suspition from the Iewes, commaunded that they should fyrst take awaie the stone, that they should smel the stynche, haue sure tokens of hys death, see hym beinge raysed agayne, by the onelye power and vertue of hys worde, and touche or handle hym first, after he was reliued. But what if we should grau~t that this was spoken vntoo the Apostles? What shoulde ye get by it?


Prieste.
That the Lorde hath ge|uen power to his Apostles, too louse.


Prentyse.
No, no mayster person, not so: for, if ye wil grou~d your selfs vpon allegoryes (as yt can do none other here) this doc|trine is rather to be gathered vpo~

thys historie: that Christ by thys facte wolde admonish vs, that we shoulde louse theym, whome he had raysed, that is to say, that we should not beare in remembrau~ce those synnes, that he hym self had forgotten, or that we shoulde not conde~ne them as synners, whom he had quyted  assoyled: agayn, that wee shoulde not vpbraye the synnes, which he him selfe hadde forgeuen: or where he is merciful hym self, and reddy too forgeue, we shoulde not be cruell, and bent to vengeaunce. Go now maister Personne,  make boaste of your allegoryes.


Priest.
It was neuer mery with vs, sythens such ionge boyes presumed to reade the scrip+tures. What say ye to this, seing, ye are suche a doctour? Did not thei, that came to the baptisme of Ihon,Math. 3. co~fesse their synnes? Why should not thei likewise, y^t come to

receyue their housel, be shryuen?


Prentyse.
Ye muste marke, may|ster Personne, that Ihon prea|ched the baptisme of repentau~ce, and did baptise with water vnto repentaunce. And therfore it is no merueylle, that they, whiche came to be baptised, acknowledged or confessed themselfs too be syn|ners. For baptisme is a Sacrame~t or mysticall signe of forgeuenesse of synnes: whome then shoulde they receyue too it, but them, that acknowledge them selfs to be sin|ners? They therefore confessed theyr synnes, that they mighte be baptised.
But how or after what fasshio~ they co~fessed theyr synnes, where shall we learne better then in the thyrde Chapiter of the Gospell of LukeLuc. 3. For after Ihon had made his dreadefull sermon: the people, being striken with a feare

of Gods righteouse iudgemente, asked hym, saying: What shall we do than? Likewise the Pub|licans and the Souldiours, that came to be baptised. Let anye in|differente manne reade the whole place throughoute. And as for your shryuinge afore the recey|uinge of the Sacramente, wolde god, that godly order, which was set fourthe in kynge Edwardes dayes, whome we maye rightwel call the flour of all Christendom, myghte hadde ben kepte and ob|serued. For in many churches, that were godlye refourmed, the Communicantes should the night before bee called together before the ministre, there to receiue most godly instructions.
And if any contentio~, stryfe or hatred hadde ben betwene any personnes, there shoulde hadde ben honeste agreemente made,

or euer they had come to the Lor|des borde, all notorious and open synners beinge excluded from it. And what godly confession were they wont to make together in the face of the whole churche, afore y^e holy communion was ministred vnto them? No suche thinges are now vsed, but rather all is done contrarye to the order of the holy Ghoste, withoute any edifyinge. And this one onely thing oughte to fraye all godly men  women, to be present at it. For who, being godly mynded, wolde seme w^t his presence to consente  agree too y^e breaking of that order, which the holy Ghoste hath appointed and ordeyned to bee in the churche of God. But of this we will com|mone more at large, when ye shal be at better leasure.


Prieste.
Well, I perceyue, that I muste talke with you, concer|ninge

this receyuinge of the Sa|crament. But I haue businesse nowe: therfore differring that co~|munication tyll an other tyme, I will make an ende of this present matter, that we haue in hande. Are not these sainct Iames woor|des?Iames. 5. knowledge your fautes one to an other.
Can ye denye, that the holye Ghost doeth here bidde, ordeyne and commaunde confession? What are all the heretykes, in all the whole worlde, able too saye a|gaynste this manifest and playne saying of this most holy Apostel?


Prentyse.
Ye shoulde haue rehersed the whole texte. For he did not onely saye: Confesse or knowledge youre fautes one too an other, but also, praye one for an other.
Whereby it must nedes folow, (seinge he commaundeth as well

mutuall prayer, as mutuall con|fession) if we must confesse and knowledge our fautes onelye too the priestes, that we muste alsoo praye for them onely. What an ab+surditie shoulde this be? More|ouer it shoulde folowe of Iames wordes, that priestes only ought to confesse and knowledge theyr fautes one to an other. For, when Iames willeth vs too confesse or knowledge our fautes one too an other, he speaketh of such, as must heare one an others confession. For so sou~deth this Greke worde allelois, whiche is as muche too saye, as mutually or reciprocally.
But none, after the bishope of Romes lawe, canne or maye heare one an others confession, onelesse they bee priestes after hys holye order: and thys can bee vnderstanded but of suche, as

oughte too knowledge their fau|tes one to an other, or heare the confession one of an other.
Therefore this place serueth nothinge for youre purpose. Let vs rather seeke the true meaninge of it, maister personne, that wee maye haue profit thereby.
The true meaninge therefore of this texte of saincte Iames is, that we oughte to knowledge our infirmities, weakenesses and fau|tes one too an other, too the ende we maye geue good, wholsome and comfortable counsaill one too an other: and knowynge in what case or state we stande all, praye one for an other moste earnestlye vnto God for the helpe and assi|staunce of hys holye spyryte, but mooste specially for the for|geuenesse of oure synnes.



Prieste.
I perceyue well enough, what marke ye shout at. Ye will haue no confessio~ at all, that so y maye lyue styll after a carnall ly|bertie.


Prentyse.
As though that kynde of confession, that ye vse, coulde refrayne or kepe men from carnall libertie.


Priest.
Men ne|uer lyued soo dissolutely,A false prayse of auriculare confession. nor so wantonelye, as they haue done sence this holy confession haue be~ put doune.
There is nowe no shamefaste|nesse in the worlde, honestye is clene gone, youth standeth in no awe. And why is thys? Be|cause forsouth they are free from the yoke of holy shryfte. All the yeare longe, when they remem|bred, that they muste come vn|der BENEDICITE, they were affrayed to do any thyng a|misse; but when it was gone once,

so y^t they wer deliuered fro~ al fear of co~fessio~, they did set al at sixe  seuen, not passyng how they dyd lyue.What mis|chiefe au|ricular con+fession doth For they knewe, that they shold be called to no reckenyngs. Wherfore any man may easely se, whi ye be so great an enemy to the wholsome ordeynaunce  co~stitu+tion of the church.


Pre~tise.
Wher as ye laye to my charge, y^t I will haue no co~fessio~, ye shamfully sla~+der me. For I haue alwayes alo|wed y^t kynde of confessyon, that god hath commaunded vs in hys holy scripture: but y^t beggerly co~|fession, that ye haue inuented of your own braynes, without gods holy worde, to bryng all mens co~s+ciences vnder your gyrdels, I do vtterly detest  abhorre. And it is so farre of, y^t me~ should by it lerne to feare god, that rather by it the feare of God is dryuen and clene chassed away out of their hearts.

For when the rude  simple are once perswaded, that if thei be o~ce in the yere shriuen of the Prieste, thei shal haue cleane remission of their synnes and receaue (if at lest they wilbe stil y^e children of your whoryshe mother Antichrystes church) ful absolution both a pe|na et culpa: what care they howe they lyue al the yeare long? It is enough, thinke they, if a litell bee|fore Easter they co~e to sir Iohn lacke latin, and tel him a tale in the eare of an houre long: and y^t they may escape the better chepe, loke who~ they know to be most foolish  most vnlearned emo~g the rab|blement of priestes, him will thei chose for their gostly father. For why? they haue been made to be|leue, y^t al the sinnes, y^t thei confesse themselues of vnto y^t prieste, are quite  clene forgeue~,  put out of remembraunce before god, eue~ as

soone as they haue tolde them to their gostly father. As for repen|taunce  the due fruetes thereof, it is not vnknowen, how wel and how substa~tially ye ha~del y^e mat|ter emonge you. For whereas ye should sende them to Christ, who is y^e only phisicion of y^e soules,  exhort the~ to such works, as God hath prepared for vs to walke in: ye most vngodly send the~ to dead creatures, prescribing vnto them not y^e workes co~mau~ded of God, but superstitious works of youre own inue~tion, making the~ an hon+dreth fold more y^e children of hel, tha~ they were afore they came to you. I doe here lette passe how y^t ye make it a matter of such necessi+te, that by your own doctryne no ma~ can wythout it obteyne salua|cyon: yea so~e now a dayes are not ashamed to make it equall w^t bap|tisme  the supper, which ar sacta+mentes

instituted and ordeyned of Chryst himselfe. Besids al this is it not made a snare,Auricular confession is made a snare to snarle men wyth all. to snarle me~ w^tal? For the first questio~ almost that y^e priest vseth to aske them, y^t now at this present come to shrift, is: whether they beleue not, that y^e body of Chryst is in the sacrame~t of the aultare, fleshe, bloode, and bones, as he was borne of y^e vir|gin Mary: if they once saye nay, not only they shal not haue absolu+cion, but also they shall straighte waies be complained of  accused to y^e bishop,  so put in ieopardye to lose both body  goods. What honesty  goodnes ye be wont to teach fayre maide~s,  me~s wiues when ye haue the~ behynde a cloth vnder benedicite, I wil not here now at this present rehearce: leste I should offend honest and sham+fast eares. But although I am a|shamed to tel it (the thynge is so

vilainous  so filthy) yet are ye not ashamed to doe it. As for that ye alleadge, that youre confessyo~ kepeth youth vnder awe, and that seruauntes wer neuer in awe, se~s it was take~ away: y^e same is plai~e false: for it is rather a meane and away to make the~ to stande in no awe at al of their parentes nor of their masters and mistres, seyng they be perswaded, that whatso|euer they doe, if they be once shry+uen of it vnto the Priest, it shalbe cleane forgeuen vnto the~: so that if they stande in any awe, it shall be of sir Iohn,  not of the~ that they should stande in awe of. But if, puttyng asyde such beggerlye in|uencyons of men, ye woulde dili|gentlye oute of Gods boke teache youth their duetye towards their elders, towardes their parentes, towardes their masters and my|stres, not once or twyse in y^e yeare

but euery fourthnighte, puttynge before their eyes the fierse venge+aunce of god,The waye to dryue y^e feare of God into y^e youth. that hangeth ouer y^e heades of all disobedient children and of al vntrue dealig seruau~ts, and that there is no way to pur|chase the fauoure  blessynge of God, except they will repente,  takyng holde through fayth vpon our sauiour Iesu Chryst, walk vp ryghtly in their vocatyon, beeyng sure that god seeth both their do|inges and also the verye secrete thoughtes of theyr heartes: then would they in dede stande in that true awe, that God wyl haue the~ to stande in, fearing him, not w^t mens doctrynes  preceptes,Math. 15. Esay. 29 but wyth the true feare, that he com|maundeth in his worde.


Pryeste.
By S. Mary, I wil speake to my lord byshop, that ye may come in|to the pulpit and make a sermon to the people. I pray you master

doctour of the newe learnyng, tel me, what the same confessyon is, that God hath commaunded.


Pre~+tyse.
I canne well inoughe abyde your mockes master person, saye on me what ye wyl. In the meane whiles I wil not let to tel y^e truth. First and formest there is a con|fession,The confes+syon that we ar bou~d to make to God. that God wil haue too bee done vnto hym, wherein we doe daylye and hourely confesse oure synnes vnto hym, accusynge and condemnyng our selues before hi as vnrighteous and myserable synners, that oure synnes maye through his mercye, whyche we faythfully craue for, be forgeuen vnto vs.
And of thys confessyon doeth Dauid speake, when he sayth: I wyll knowledge my synne vnto the,Psal. 32.  mine vnrighteousnes haue I not hid. I sayed, I wyl confes my synnes vnto the lord, and so y^t forgaueste me y^e wickednes of my

synne. And in the .51. psalme these be his wordes:Psal. 51. haue mercy vpon me, O God, after thy great good+nes: accordynge to the multitude of thy mercyes, doe awaye myne offences. I knowledge my faulte and my synne is alway before me. Daniel in the 9. chap. of his pro|phecy maketh thys confessyon vn+to god:Dani. 9 O Lord, y^u great and fear+ful God, we haue sinned, we haue offended, we haue been disobedi|ent  gone backe, yea we haue de|parted fro~ al thy precepts  iudge+mentes. And Iohn y^e Eua~geliste wryteth thus:1. Ioh. 1. if we knowledge our synnes, God is faythfull and iust, to forgeue vs our synnes,  to clense vs fro~ all vnryghteous|nes. Thys confession sayth Saint Augustine, writi~g ad Iulianu~ co|mite~, whych is done vnto God,Augu. ad Iulianu~ co+mitem. is required by Gods law: wher|of sayth he Sainct Iohn speaketh

sayi~g: if we knowledge our sines c. for wythoute it synne cannot be forgeuen. And of thys doeth spryng the co~fession and acknow|ledging of the greate and vnspea|kable mercy of God. For excepte we doe truely from the botome of our hearts recognise and acknow+ledge our miserye  wyckednes, we shal neuer truly confesse  set forth, prayse and extoll, enhau~ce  magnifie the great mercy of god, and vnspeakable goodnes of our sauiour Iesu Chryst oure Lorde, declared to vs warde. And herof it doth come, that they that haue a true feling of their own misery,  of their sinnefull  corrupted na|ture, hauing on the other side be+fore their eyes y^e exceading great bounteousnes of their heauenlye father: are alwayes ready to con|fesse openly their synnes in the great congregacyon. As whe~ Da|uid

was rebuked of Nathan, he then, beyng prycked in his conscy|ence, dyd say:2. Regu. 2. Peccaui domino, I haue synned vnto thee lord. As if he should saye: I dooe not excuse my self, nor I refuse not to be cou~+ted of al men a synner, or to haue that to be published abroade a|mong men, whych I woulde had to be~ hydden affore. And for thys cause god dyd in tymes passed or+deyne emong the Israelites,Leui. 16. that the people should openly in y^e te~|ple confesse theyr synnes. For god did foresee this to be a very neces+sary meane, wherby they should be broughte into the true knowe|ledge of themselues. And it is also most conuenient, that by acknow+ledging our misery we should sett forth the goodnes and mercye of God emong vs, and publyshe it openly before al y^e world. O how Godly was this do~e in king Ed|wards

tyme? whensoeuer the peo+ple of god gathered themselues together, to offer their spirituall sacrifices,Augusti. de vera  falsa peni|tentia. ca. 11 and to make their com|mon prayers vnto him. S. Augu|styne de vera et falsa penitentia cap. 11. maketh mencyon of an ope~ or publike confession, whyche he defineth after thys maner. Ope~ or publike confession is, wherby in tymes passed they, that were dead in open synnes, declared the~+selues to be dead, publishing open+ly theyr death,  shewyng ope~ly y^e fruites of repe~tau~ce, y^e the people myght bewayle him y^t was lost. Thys was in dede the wont and custom of the old au~cient church, when any man had co~mytted any notorious cryme or fault, that he should be exco~municated and put out of the co~gregacion, til he had earnestly repented  in toke ther|of co~fessed his synne openly in y^e

face of y^e whole churche. But thys wholsome kynde of confessyo~ is cleane abolyshed,  in steade ther of an apyshe momerye crepte into the churche. S. Paul semeth to speake of it, in the 1. Cor. 5.  in the 2. Cor. 2.


Priest.
Is this al that ye can saye? Haue ye no more stuffe in your bogette?


Prentise.
I haue yet somewhat more to say.Two ki~des of priuate confession alowed in the worde of god. For ye shall vnderstande, that the scryp|ture doeth besyde al this alow. 2. kyndes of priuate confession. The one we vse for our own sake, when we beeyng troubled in co~s|cyence, doe open our griefe vnto our neighbour, to y^e ende he maye helpe  coumfort vs, w^t some god+ly  wholsome counsel. And as touchyng thys kynde of co~fessio~, though by gods worde we haue liberte to open our conscyence  to shewe oure griefe to any of our Christen brethren, who~ we thinke

to be able to cou~sel  co~fort vs: so if y^e pastours or shepeheardes bee me~ of godlynes  learning, and of a pure  sounde iudgemente, we ought most specially in y^e trouble  angours of the conscience to re|sort or flye vnto the~, that accordi~g to their office, they may in time minister y^e co~fortable salfe of gods word vnto our wou~ded co~scie~ces. For they are ordeyned  institu|ted of God for the same purpose: therfore ought we most chyefelye to come vnto the~, that so we may enioye those spiritual benefytes, that God of his mere mercy and goodnes doeth daylye offer vnto vs by the~. But what maner of pa|stours are they,The Pa|stors and shepeherds of Anti|chrystes churche. that ye wyl haue vs now a dayes to come to? me~ w^t out al godlynes, w^tout learnyng  iudgement, men geuen to al kinde of superstition and Idolatry, me~, of who~ ye can learne nothing els,

but to blaspheme God and hys worde, yea men that are ready, in stede of geuing good and whol|some counsell, to cut all mennes throtes, that will not consent and agree to their abominacion  stin+kyng blasphemyes. Gregorye, as we haue in the decrees,Gregorye. De peni. di+sti. 6. Cano~ Sacerdos. did ordei~e that a Priest should in no wyse, neyther by signe nor toke~, vtter y^e confession of any man: but these your bloud suckers haue a good sport, by vtteryng mens confessi|on, to put them in ieopardye to lose both bodye and goods. How largely, when they syt bybbynge vpon their ale benches, they talke of those thynges, that they haue heard vnder benedicite, it is to shamful to tel. The fathers of the west churche would neuer confes their synnes vnto them, of whom they coulde not be taughte nor in|structed to godlynes; but ye wyll

haue vs to confesse our selues to them, that haue no more learnyng than dull headed asses. Oh that those holy Canons mought take place, which wil vs to shu~ne those gostly fathers 'that are blyndon+ly and ignoraunte of gods way: in so muche that they appoynte, that we shold rather confesse our selues to our neyghbour, beeyng a lay man, than vnto that Priest, that wanteth both learnynge and iudgemente. The other kynde of confession is, that we make for our neighbours sake, to reconcyle hym vnto vs, if we haue offe~ded hym in any maner of thynge. Of thys kynde of confessyon dooeth our sauyour Iesus Chryst speake when he sayth: if, whe~ y^u offerest thy gyfte at the aultar, y^u doest re|member, y^t thi brother hath aught agai~st the:Math. 5. leue ther thy gift,  goe thy way, be first reco~ciled to thy

brother,  then come,  offer thy gift. This reneweth loue  nouri+sheth charite, if we doe humbly ac+knowledge our fautes to who~ we haue offended for pardon: of this confession sayeth Cypryan: Thei doe penaunce tyll a due tyme, and afterwardes come to co~fession,  then the bishop  the clergy do re+store vnto the~ y^e right of y^e co~mu|nio~. But of thys enough.


Priest.
Ye  to much to, to se so much di+uinite in a Prentyse.


Pre~tyse.
Ye haue heard my co~science of y^e obe|dience to magistrates, Auricular co~fessio~,  of y^e confession y^t god re+quireth.
